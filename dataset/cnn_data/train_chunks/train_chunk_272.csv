"(CNN) -- Venus Williams probably wishes she could play more in Dubai. The seven-time grand slam winner claimed her first tennis title in two years and her biggest since Dubai in 2010 after defeating France's Alize Cornet 63 60 on Saturday. Williams has been hindered by Sjogren's Syndrome, injuries and is well into her 30s but the older of the tennis playing Williams sisters can seemingly do no wrong in Dubai, stretching her winning streak to 15 matches. She was already in command of the first set at 5-3 but then picked it up a notch, not conceding another game. ""I have had a good week,"" Williams, 33, was quoted as saying by the WTA's website. ""Everything is falling together pretty much, is all I can say."" Her performance in Dubai has no doubt left her hoping for better results at the majors in 2014. Williams last reached a grand slam quarterfinal four years ago and her last grand slam title came in 2008. Cornet was attempting to pull off a rare Williams sisters double after ousting Serena Williams in the semifinals -- only seven players have beaten the siblings in the same tournament. Despite the defeat, she might return to the top 20 in the rankings next week after a five-year gap. ""Alize is playing great,"" Williams said. ""I think if she continues to play like that, she's going to play deep in a lot of tournaments and improve. ""It's great to see that, because she's a great addition to the game. She brings so much passion on the court. ""I mean, I was fully expecting to play Serena, so for her to get that win was awesome.""","Venus Williams downs Alize Cornet to win tennis title in Dubai .

"(CNN) -- Ten states plan to file a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the new health care reform bill, Florida's attorney general announced Monday. Bill McCollum, the Republican attorney general under fellow Republican Gov. Charlie Crist, told a news conference that the lawsuit would be filed once President Obama signs the health care bill into law. He said he'll be joined by his counterparts in Alabama, Nebraska, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas,  Utah and Washington. All of the attorneys general in the 10 states mentioned by McCollum are Republican, but McCollum said the lawsuit would be about the law and not politics. Also Monday, Virginia's Republican attorney general said his state would file a lawsuit challenging the health care bill. It was unclear if Virginia would join the other states or proceed on its own. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill on Sunday night, and Obama intends to sign it Tuesday, according to Democratic sources. What will health care reform mean to you? McCollum said the lawsuit would challenge the bill's provision requiring people to purchase health insurance, along with provisions that will force state government to spend more on health care services. ""This is a tax or a penalty on just living, and that's unconstitutional,"" he said of the mandate to purchase health coverage. ""There's no provision in the Constitution of the United States giving Congress the power to do that."" McCollum also said that portions of the bill would force states to spend money they don't have, which he called a violation of the 10th Amendment to the Constitution. ""There's no way we can do what's required in this bill and still provide for education, for foster care, for the incarceration of prisoners, all the other things that are in this bill,"" he said. McCollum said he expected the lawsuit to eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court. Later Monday, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the Obama administration expected to win any lawsuits filed against the health care bill. The Democratic governor of Washington criticized her state's attorney general, Rob McKenna, for being part of the planned lawsuit. Gov. Chris Gregoire issued a statement that said she disagreed with McKenna's decision and that the attorney general was not representing her. Gregoire's statement also said she would actively oppose the lawsuit.","Virginia, 10 other states plan to file suit challenging health care reform bill .

"(CNN) -- Virginia Tech plans to consider all its options after it reviews a jury verdict that found it was negligent in a 2007 shooting rampage that left 33 people dead, including the gunman, a university spokesman said. The move follows Wednesday's verdict by a seven-member jury in Christiansburg, Virginia, that awarded $4 million each to two victims' families who sued the state for wrongful death in the shooting massacre. ""We are disappointed with today's decision and stand by our long-held position that the administration and law enforcement at Virginia Tech did their absolute best with the information available on April 16, 2007,"" Mark Owczarski, a university spokesman, said in a statement. ""We will discuss this matter with the attorney general, carefully review the case and explore all of the options available."" The jury found Virginia Tech failed to notify students early enough following the discovery of two shooting victims at West Ambler Johnston dormitory. The two students were the first victims of Seung-Hui Cho, who went on to kill 30 more people at Norris Hall -- home to the Engineering Science and Mechanics Department -- after chaining the doors closed. He also wounded 17 people before killing himself. The families of Erin Peterson and Julia Pryde, who were killed in Norris Hall, argued that had officials notified students, faculty and staff earlier of the shooting at the dormitory, lives might have been spared. Peterson died while in her French class; Pryde was shot while attending an advanced hydrology class. The Peterson and Pryde families did not accept a portion of an $11 million settlement between the state and the families of victims, opting instead to sue for wrongful death. ""It certainly was the end of a long process for us where we just said we wanted to get a little bit more truth. A little bit of accountability and we weren't just going to go away, and so we came here and this is what happened,"" Harry Pryde, Julia's father, told CNN affiliate WDBJ of Roanoke, Virginia. While the jury awards the families $4 million each, an attorney for the state has asked the judge to reduce the verdict to $100,000 per claim. State law limits awards to $100,000, though the judge approved a request by an attorney for the family to file a motion on the matter. The university does not believe the evidence presented during the trial showed there was an increased danger on campus, Owczarski, the university spokesman, said. Virginia Tech President Charles W. Steger, in a letter to the school's faculty, staff and students, said the killings ""were an unprecedented act of violence that no one could have foreseen."" The evidence presented during the trial ""established that it was the unanimous decision of three law enforcement agencies that the mass shooting was simply not foreseeable. Only with hindsight can one conclude that Cho's unprecedented acts were foreseeable,"" Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, a spokesman for the state attorney general, said in a statement following the verdict. Authorities initially believed the shooting at the dormitory was a case of domestic violence, a jealous boyfriend who shot the couple. While police were questioning a possible suspect, Cho opened fire at Norris Hall. The Department of Education found, in a 2010 report, that Virginia Tech did not notify students in a ""timely manner"" -- as dictated by what is known as the Clery Act -- after the shooting at the dormitory. The government also fined Virginia Tech for failing to follow internal school policies. According to the Department of Education report, police went to the dormitory at 7:24 a.m. after being notified about the shooting of two students. The university notified students, faculty and staff of the shooting in an e-mail at 9:26 a.m., the report said. It was about 15 minutes after the e-mail was sent that Cho began his rampage, it said. Since the massacre, the school has beefed up its communications, using methods that include e-mail notices; telephone, cellular phone and text messages; classroom electronic message signs; posters; university website notices; campus loudspeakers and desktop alerts. In addition, the safety phones in the campus and local community are connected to the campus 911 emergency operator and residential buildings are accessible only through a key card. Door alarms sound, alerting police, if an exterior door is propped open in a residence hall.

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Gerry Adams' arrest in connection with the 1972 abduction and killing of a mother of 10 by the Irish Republican Army is being praised by the family of the victim. Jean McConville's daughter, Helen McKendry, told CNN that the arrest was a welcome step in the family's long struggle to find justice. ""There's been silence over my mother's murder for 22 years and then I went public, and then we got her body back in 2003 and gave her a proper burial. Now we have learned Gerry Adams has been arrested in connection with the murder,"" McKendry said. ""I can only do like everyone else in my case and hope that he will be brought to a court of law and be charged with my mother's murder, so my family can get truth and justice for my mother."" Adams has long denied having any role in the death of McConville, a widowed mother of 10 who was reportedly killed by the IRA because the group believed she was a spy for the British army. The Sinn Fein leader continued to be questioned Thursday, a day after he surrendered himself to police, his party said. Martin McGuinness, a Sinn Fein member and the Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, told reporters in Belfast that the arrest was unnecessary, unjustified and politically motivated. He said he had seen the ""dark side"" of Northern Ireland policing ""flex its muscles in the course of the past couple of days"" and that the arrest was a ""'deliberate attempt to influence the elections that are due to take place in three weeks' time."" McGuinness said he was confident that Adams would be able to rejoin election campaigning shortly and would ""continue to lead our party in a very positive way."" 'Take away the fear' McKendry said she hoped that the progress made in the peace process in recent years would make it more likely that charges could be brought over her mother's death. ""I do think that there would be people willing to come forward when they take away the fear, and will come forward to help,"" she said. ""A lot of the members of the IRA have approached myself and my husband and spoke about what happened and a lot of them did not agree with what happened. A lot of them wanted to see Gerry Adams stand trial for this."" Earlier, her brother, Michael McConville, echoed her words. ""The McConville family is glad to see police are taking our mother's murder seriously and are doing all they can to bring the people that murdered her to justice,"" he said. ""An awful lot of people in the north and south of Ireland are glad to see Gerry Adams being arrested for this."" Adams: I am innocent of abduction, killing . In a statement released shortly before the Sinn Fein leader surrendered himself for questioning Wednesday, Adams, 65, vehemently denied any involvement in the killing. ""I believe that the killing of Jean McConville and the secret burial of her body was wrong and a grievous injustice,"" Adams said in the statement posted on his party website. ""Malicious allegations have been made against me. I reject these."" The questioning of Adams was not unexpected. Adams said he told authorities last month that he was willing to meet with investigators. ""While I have never disassociated myself from the IRA and I never will, I am innocent in the abduction, killing or burial of Mrs. McConville,"" Adams said. Long associated with the IRA, once considered the armed wing of Sinn Fein, Adams is a prominent Catholic politician who helped broker peace in Northern Ireland. Today, Sinn Fein is Ireland's second-largest opposition party. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said a 65-year-old man, whom it declined to identify but described as a suspect in the McConville case, remained in custody Thursday. Single gunshot wound . Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, and Protestant loyalists wanted to keep it that way. Catholics were fighting to force the British out and reunite the north with the rest of Ireland. Known as the Troubles, the conflict lasted 30 years, ending in 1998 with the Good Friday Agreement that brokered peace. The agreement provided a political framework for power-sharing among the parties. The IRA admitted in 1999 to killing a number of people who have become known as ""The Disappeared"" -- those who vanished during the Troubles. Among the victims was McConville, whose remains were found partially buried on a beach in County Louth in 2003. She died of a single gunshot wound to the back of the head. McConville, 38, was taken from her home in Belfast in December 1972, McKendry told CNN in a 2012 interview. ""They came about tea time and they dragged her out of the bathroom and dragged her out,"" said McKendry, who was a teenager at the time. ""All I ever wanted was to know the reason why they killed my mother."" The investigation into McConville's killing was revived by authorities after the release, following a protracted legal battle, of certain interviews given by members of the IRA, who implicated Adams. The recordings were made by Boston College as part of the Belfast Project, which is a collection of interviews conducted with former Northern Irish paramilitary fighters. They provide an oral history of the decades of fighting. How tapes made by U.S. library could solve N. Ireland murder . Participants in the project were told their recorded interviews would be kept secret until their deaths. Last year a U.S. court ruled that tapes of deceased interviewees that contained claims about the killing be given by Boston College to police in Northern Ireland. One of those featured in the tapes was Brendan Hughes, a now-deceased former commander of the Irish Republican Army. Gerry Adams arrested for questioning over 1972 IRA slaying .

"(CNN) -- Hero Vincent has a dream: to see the titans of Wall Street trade their palatial office suites for a row of dank prison cells. The crime? Theft. Stealing billion-dollar, taxpayer-funded bailouts. Getting rich on your dime while you struggle to make ends meet. And if you're tired of standing by while the rich get richer and the middle class crumbles, he has a suggestion: Take it to the streets. Vincent, 21 and unemployed, has suddenly become one of several unofficial spokesmen for Occupy Wall Street, a leaderless protest movement made largely of twenty-somethings upset with the state of the economy, the state of the war in Afghanistan, the state of the environment, and the state of America and the world in general. If that sounds vague, it's meant to be. In less than three weeks, the movement has become a magnet for countless disaffected Americans. And at a time when an overwhelming majority of Americans say the country's on the wrong track, there's no shortage of new potential recruits. Photos: 'Occupy Wall Street' protests . On Saturday, more than 700 protesters were arrested for blocking the Brooklyn Bridge. A splinter group called Occupy Chicago touted a ""huge afternoon march."" In Boston, 34 groups -- unions and other organizations focused on everything from foreclosure prevention to climate change -- marched for ""an economy that works for all of us,"" according to one website. Over on the West Coast, Occupy Los Angeles kicked off with a march to City Hall. In Seattle, demonstrators touted ""a leaderless resistance movement with people of many colors (and) genders."" On Monday, a live video feed from Occupy Wall Street was featured at the start of a three-day conference of progressive leaders in Washington. What does it all mean? ""We're here for different reasons,"" said Vincent, whose father is also unemployed and recently went through a home foreclosure. ""But at the end of the day, it all boils down to one thing, and that's accountability. We want accountability for the connection between Wall Street and the politicians."" ""Something has to change,"" he told CNN. ""We're out here because we're tired of what's been going on."" Giles Clarke, a 46-year-old freelance photographer and father of two, echoes Vincent's call for greater accountability. ""People have simply had enough,"" Clarke said. ""We're living in an age where the inequality between high-end Wall Street and the (rest of us) is simply a gap that has become too big. Millions of people have lost their jobs. Millions of people have lost their homes."" There's been, Clarke said, ""way too much cloak-and-dagger activity within the corridors of Wall Street"" in recent years. ""This is about raising awareness and a change of political discourse."" The average person, according to Vincent, ""is just fed up because there's no more middle class. The margin between us and the employers is so great now. Where will we be in a couple of years?"" Does he actually want to occupy Wall Street and shut it down? ""We want to educate people,"" Vincent said. But ""if Wall Street actually shuts down, we'll be happy about it."" The movement ""feels like something that will ultimately spread like the Arab spring,"" said Egberto Willies, a CNN iReporter in Washington. ""I call it the American autumn."" Occupy Wall Street and its offshoots have clear strains of liberal economic populism -- a powerful force in U.S. history during various times characterized by growing economic stress. That said, it could be a mistake to label or tie the movement to a specific agenda, said Susan Olzak, a Stanford University sociology professor. ""It's difficult to classify a social protest movement early on in its history,"" Olzak told CNN. ""Clearer goals could eventually emerge, but there's no guarantee."" ""Many movements fizzle out. Others become more organized,"" she said. But ""I think we run a risk (by) taking a snapshot at any one point in time, and trying to categorize the movement in any one way based on that snapshot. The only way to study these protest movements is to follow them over time."" If Vincent, Willies and Clarke have their way, there will be plenty of time for this movement to continue to grow and evolve. Some observers question if it could become a liberal counterweight to the conservative populism of the tea party. For his part, Clarke predicts the movement will go international in the next few months. ""Let's get talking,"" he urged. ""Let's have some of these issues looked at."" CNN's Greg Botelho and Maggie Lake contributed to this report.","Occupy Wall Street is a protest movement covering a range of issues, with no clear leadership .
Many of the protesters are upset with growing wealth divide in the United States .

"(CNN) -- A tornado touched down in southern Mississippi on Sunday, injuring more than a dozen people and causing widespread damage. So far, no one has been reported killed, which authorities hope will remain true. ""We're really blessed because we don't have a fatality that we know of right now, and no major injuries. But we have a number of major damages to our structures around town,"" said Johnny DuPree, mayor of Hattiesburg, where the tornado hit. ""If there is a good thing about this, it happened on a Sunday when most of these structures were vacant,"" he said. Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant declared a state of emergency in four counties: Forrest, Lamar, Lawrence and Marion. iReporter shopping at Target captures video of tornado . Hattiesburg, which straddles Forrest and Lamar counties, is home to the University of Southern Mississippi. It suffered damage to several buildings, but there were no reports of injuries there. University police declared a state of emergency and urged those not on campus to stay away until further notice. Nearby Oak Grove High School also suffered damage. Randy Wright posted photographs to his Twitter account of the school, showing debris strewn on what looked to be a parking lot and a truck upside down in a baseball diamond. The Hattiesburg Public School District canceled classes Monday. The university campus will also be closed. ""There's quite a few homes without power at this point. Quite a few trees on houses, on cars, that type of thing,"" said Forrest County Sheriff Billy McGee. He said that from 10 to 15 people were taken to the hospital, but that none suffered serious injuries. Another three were reported injured in nearby Marion County. It was not clear how those people were hurt. Sarah Lawrence, a Hattiesburg resident, said that the storm sounded like ""stuff being thrown."" ""Within seconds, everything changed,"" she said. ""I didn't feel like there was much notice. I heard the sirens and everything looked OK outside, so I started making preparations to go into the bathroom. And then, next thing I know, all the lights went out, and it got dark outside.""

"(CNN) -- The six countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council will close their Syrian embassies, the council said Thursday, calling on the international community ""to stop what is going on in Syria."" The action, the council said, ""confirms its position rejecting the Syrian regime's persistence in killing unarmed Syrian people and ignoring all efforts to resolve the current tragic situation in Syria."" Abdullatif Al-Zayani, the council's secretary-general, ""also called on the international community to take urgent and firm actions to stop what is going on in Syria including killing, torturing and flagrant violations of the human rights of the Syrian people."" Council members include the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait. Nations including the United States and France previously have closed their embassies in Damascus, while Italy, Britain and Spain are among countries that have suspended embassy activities. The Syrian conflict is entering its second year, with President Bashar al-Assad's fierce crackdown against anti-government enclaves showing no signs of ending. More than 8,000 civilians have been killed during the conflict, the United Nations says, but opposition activists said the overall toll is more than 9,000, mostly civilians. The numbers have exceeded 9,700 and are ""fast approaching 10,000,"" said Rafif Jouejati, spokeswoman for the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition activist network. International officials in a Syrian-led mission will attempt to gauge humanitarian conditions across the turbulent nation this weekend as world powers push for open entree to provide much-needed relief. Valerie Amos, U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said Thursday the government will lead a mission to the provinces of Homs, Hama, Tartous, Latakia, Aleppo, Deir Ezzor, Rif Damashq and Daraa. U.N. and Organization of Islamic Cooperation officials will accompany the mission, she said. ""It is increasingly vital that humanitarian organizations have unhindered access to identify urgent needs and provide emergency care and basic supplies,"" she said in a written statement. ""There is no time to waste."" The United States is providing over $12 million in humanitarian assistance through the U.N. and other humanitarian organizations for relief, including $5.5 million to the U.N. refugee agency, $3 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross, $3 million to the World Food Program and $1 million to non-governmental organizations, the State Department said. Iran, an ally of Syria, said it sent medicine and medical equipment to Syria, Iranian media reported. A plane carrying 40 tons of aid arrived in Damascus. Iranian Ambassador to Syria Mohammad Reza Raouf Sheibani said Iran would send more relief, such as food, ambulances, tents and blankets, ""to Syria's crisis-hit areas."" Iran's Red Crescent Society said Wednesday that the supplies were sent in response to a call by the Syrian Red Crescent Society. The unrest continued on the first anniversary of the Syrian uprising, the widespread grass-roots resistance to the policies and rule of al-Assad. Similar uprisings across the Arab world, from Tunisia to Yemen, and the populace's grinding political and economic grievances inspired the protests. ""One year ago today, Syrians emboldened by the changing tide of history in their region stood up in the streets of Damascus to appeal for their universal rights and freedoms,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement on Thursday. A few days later, security forces cracked down on hundreds who turned out in the southern city of Daraa, angry about the mistreatment of local children who were jailed for painting anti-government graffiti. The violence in Daraa sparked the regime crackdown and catalyzed the uprising, which spread to many cities across the country. ""The Syrian authorities responded with brutal repression, which has continued unabated. Its consequences are tragically unfolding before the world's eyes,"" Ban said. Along with the thousands of deaths this year, countless other people are missing, thousands are injured and thousands have been displaced. And as the international community ponders a solution, the daily carnage seems endless. ""It is urgent to break the cycle of violence, stop military operations against civilians and prevent a further militarization of the conflict in Syria,"" Ban said. The embattled regime pressed on Thursday in its assault across Idlib province, where there is strong opposition sentiment. According to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), government security forces, which have been bombarding the city of Idlib, cleared it of ""terrorist"" elements, confiscated explosives and weapons and battled ""armed terrorist groups"" in the surrounding countryside. At least 23 people were found dead Thursday morning near a farm west of Idlib, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based opposition group. The bodies, which bore clear signs of torture, were found blindfolded, bound and shot, the activist group said. At least 37 people in Idlib were among the 46 who died in Syria Thursday, the LCC said. Government forces with large-caliber machine-guns, tanks and mortars fired ""indiscriminately at buildings and people in the street. After they entered Idlib, government forces detained people in house-to-house searches, looted buildings, and burned down houses,"" Human Rights Watch said, citing witness accounts. Residents in and around Idlib are fleeing to Turkey, according to a Turkish diplomatic source, with 1,000 Syrians crossing into the country over the previous 24 hours. Syria is trying to plant mines along the border and deploy a large number of soldiers to the area, the source said. ""This is the reason that prevents a mass influx of Syrians into Turkey. Otherwise it would be tens of thousands, not just thousands,"" the source said. At present, there are 14,000 Syrian refugees in Turkey, and the government is working to set up new camps. Two Turkish journalists who had gone missing during a visit to Idlib province have been seized by regime supporters in the village of el-Fua and handed over to the Syrian secret service, Turkey's Anadolu Ajansi news agency reported. There was no immediate comment from Turkey's Foreign Ministry. It is not known where they been taken. Aside from the deaths in Idlib, the LCC reported other deaths in Hama, Daraa, Homs and Aleppo. The opposition Free Syrian Army struck a security force vehicle in the Daraa province town of Tafas and killed the passengers inside. Security forces entered the town and clashes were reported between soldiers and the FSA -- the resistance force led and made up of military defectors. ""The regime's tanks have deployed in Tafas and are firing indiscriminately leading to several martyrs,"" the LCC said. Al-Assad's regime routinely insists ""armed terrorist groups"" are behind the bloodshed in Syria. It says it has popular support for its actions, and Thursday, government news outlets reported thousands of Syrians gathering in city squares to show their ""love"" and loyalty"" for their homeland. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or attacks in Syria because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists. But most reports from inside the country indicate the regime is slaughtering civilians to wipe out dissidents seeking al-Assad's ouster. The al-Assad family has ruled Syria for more than four decades. World powers have slammed the al-Assad regime. The Netherlands and Bahrain are the latest countries to close their Damascus embassies. Kofi Annan, the U.N.-Arab League special envoy on Syria, will brief the U.N. Security Council on the situation in a closed teleconference Friday. Annan, who met last weekend with al-Assad in Damascus, has been trying to get responses from Syrian authorities to proposals laid out over the weekend for ending the bloodshed. SANA reported Thursday that the Syrian Foreign and Expatriates Ministry ""welcomed the visit of the technical team, formed by the U.N. Special Envoy to Syria Kofi Annan, to discuss some issues related to his mission in Syria. The ministry added the step comes in the framework of the efforts exerted by Syria to make Annan's mission a success."" ""City after city, town after town, Syria's security forces are using their scorched earth methods while the (U.N.) Security Council's hands remain tied by Russia and China,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""One year on, the Security Council should finally stand together and send a clear message to (al-Assad) that these attacks should end."" Russia and China have balked at supporting tough U.N. Security Council action against Syria. Human Rights Watch said a resolution should also ""provide for targeted sanctions against officials involved in the abuse and an embargo on arms delivery to the Syrian government, and refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.""

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The U.S. soldier accused of killing 16 civilians during a weekend rampage has been transferred out of Afghanistan while awaiting charges, the NATO command said late Wednesday. The still-unidentified Army staff sergeant was transferred on the recommendation of advisers to Gen. John Allen, the commander of U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan, and because ""we do not have the proper facility in Afghanistan to detain him for longer than he is being held,"" said Capt. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman. A defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN that the man was flown to Kuwait, which has the U.S. military legal infrastructure and personnel to deal with the suspect. The NATO command in Kabul said ""some Afghan officials"" were alerted about the transfer before it was carried out. Afghanistan's parliament has demanded a public trial for the suspect, but U.S. officials said they will handle the investigation and prosecution themselves. The news came as U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta visited with troops at a base in Afghanistan, calling Sunday's killings -- as well as the accidental burning of Qurans by U.S. troops last month and the deadly riots that resulted -- ""deeply troubling."" ""We have to learn the lessons from each incident so we do everything possible they don't happen again,"" Panetta said, adding that the ""tragic"" incidents ""do not define the relationship between the coalition forces and the Afghan people."" And before meeting with Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak, Panetta praised the performance of Afghan authorities in responding to those incidents. ""We've been through some difficult events in the past few weeks, and yet the army and the police have been able to maintain order and have been able to control the situation,"" he said. ""And that tells me that you have gained a great deal of respect and trust with the Afghan people, and that's extremely important if we are to exceed in this mission of transitioning all of the areas in Afghanistan to Afghan control, governance and security."" Marines disarmed before Panetta appearance . Panetta flew into Afghanistan on Wednesday, making him the first high-ranking U.S. official to visit the country since the weekend deaths. Panetta's two-day trip was scheduled long before the killing spree and does not include a trip to the area of Kandahar province where the killings took place. A huge explosion killed eight people Wednesday in Helmand province, which Panetta was visiting, but he was not affected. The massive roadside blast ripped through a minivan, leaving its victims unrecognizable, the Helmand government said. The government blamed ""terrorists"" for the bombing. In a separate incident, a motorcycle bomb exploded in Kandahar, killing an Afghan intelligence agency security guard who was trying to defuse it, a government media agency said. Three others, including a civilian, were injured. It was unclear if the bombing was related to Sunday's killings. The Taliban have threatened to behead Americans in response to Sunday's shootings, which killed nine children, three women and four men in a pair of villages near a U.S. outpost. Afghan President Hamid Karzai calling the shootings ""acts of terror and unforgivable."" Despite some protests and local violence, the country has not erupted the way it did last month when U.S. troops burned copies of the Quran and other Islamic religious materials. Military officials said the materials had been seized from Afghan prisoners because they contained extremist messages. President Barack Obama called that incident a mistake and apologized for it, but those efforts did not head off riots and reprisal attacks that left at least six American troops and dozens of Afghans dead. ""The tragic events of recent days are a reminder that this continues to be a very difficult mission,"" Obama said Wednesday in Washington at a joint news conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron. But, he added, ""our forces are making very real progress dismantling al Qaeda, breaking the Taliban's momentum, and training Afghan forces so that they can take the lead and our troops can come home."" At an upcoming NATO summit in Chicago, ""we'll determine the next phase of transition,"" Obama said. ""This includes shifting to a support role next year, in 2013, in advance of Afghans taking full responsibility for security in 2014."" He vowed that the United States and allies will take steps to be sure the transition does not ""result in a steep cliff at the end of 2014, but rather is a gradual pace that accommodates the developing capacities of the Afghan national security forces."" He called for various factions in Afghanistan ""to end 30 years of war."" Cameron said the transition to Afghan control is under way. ""We are now in the final phases of our military mission,"" he said. Once the combat role ends, ""we'll also back President Karzai in working towards an Afghan-led political settlement,"" he vowed. Panetta met Wednesday with top U.S. and British military leaders and spoke to a group of about 200 troops at Camp Bastion and Camp Leatherneck. He then planned to travel to a nearby forward operating base to meet more coalition troops before flying to Kabul. His arrival came a day after Afghan forces came under fire during a funeral for victims of the shooting rampage, while protesters angered by the killings blocked a major highway in the country's southeast. The Taliban -- who have battled U.S. and NATO troops as well as Afghan government forces since the 2001 invasion after the September 11 attacks -- issued a statement after Sunday's killings describing U.S. troops as ""sick-minded American savages."" They said they would take revenge ""by killing and beheading Americans anywhere in the country."" The U.S. military said the Army sergeant blamed for the killings acted alone. Two senior military officials told CNN that images from security cameras around his outpost showed the suspect leaving and returning alone to the base. There is another image showing him lying in a field. A separate military source said there is imagery showing the suspect ""low crawling"" through the area outside the base. The image was collected from what the official described as an aerial asset. The suspect then is shown getting up and walking back to the outpost, according to a senior U.S. military official with direct knowledge of the information. The arrival and departure images were taken by base surveillance cameras. A military search party was put together to look for the missing soldier, but it's unclear to what extent searchers got under way before he returned to the base, the official said. The soldier, whom the military has not named, has yet to be charged. He turned himself in to his fellow Americans after the killings and could face the death penalty, Panetta has said. The officials have described the suspect as a staff sergeant from an infantry unit assigned to support Special Forces troops in Kandahar province, the Taliban heartland and a leading focus of the U.S.-led counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan. Military authorities have presented a determination of probable cause to allow them to keep the sergeant in detention, an International Security Assistance Force official told CNN. Investigators are looking into whether alcohol may have been a factor in the attack. Toxicology tests on the suspect are not complete, the two senior military officials said. The suspect served three tours of duty in Iraq before being deployed to Afghanistan, according to the U.S. military. During the suspect's last deployment, in 2010, he was riding in a vehicle that rolled over in a wreck, according to a senior Defense Department official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. After the wreck, the sergeant was diagnosed with traumatic brain injury but was treated and then found fit for duty, the official said. Speaking Tuesday at the White House, Obama said he has told Karzai that the United States ""takes this as seriously as if it was our own citizens and our own children who were murdered."" ""The killing of innocent civilians is outrageous and it's unacceptable. It's not who we are as a country and it does not represent our military,"" he said. A U.S. military investigation ""will follow the facts wherever they lead us, and we will make sure that anybody who was involved is held fully accountable with the full force of the law,"" he added. CNN's Larry Shaughnessy and Sara Sidner and journalist Ruhullah Khapalwak contributed to this report.","NEW: The suspect in the Afghan killings has been flown to Kuwait, a defense official said .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid came closer to scratching their 12-year Champions League itch with a 1-0 home victory over defending champions Bayern Munich. The La Liga side want to reach the European final for the first time since 2002 while the German champions are out to become the first team to defend the Champions League trophy. With so much at stake, attack and counter attack flowed in waves inside an electric Bernabeu Stadium Wednesday as two of Europe's top sides delivered on their promise to provide footballing fever in the semi-final. The opening -- and only -- goal of the match was a fine example of the ebb and flow. Real Madrid defender Pepe had blocked an early effort by Bayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic and Cristiano Ronaldo soon found the ball at his feet. Real's talisman -- back from hamstring and knee problems -- switched the play from defense to attack, picking out Fabio Coentrao with a perfectly-weighted ball. Coentrao threaded the ball through to Karim Benzema, who tapped in after 19 minutes to edge Real into the lead. Just minutes later, Ronaldo found himself in space in front of goal. But the golden touch of the Ballon d'Or footballer deserted him as he scooped the ball over the bar and raised his arms to the heavens in anguish. Di Maria, fed by Ronaldo, missed another good chance to double Real's advantage when his left footed shot went high and wide. Bayern turned the screw on the Spanish side as the first half wore on, dominating possession, but despite the best efforts of Philipp Lahm and Arjen Robben the home side kept them at bay. Ronaldo quickly got down to business at the restart as he had a shot palmed away by Manuel Neuer. The Bayern goalkeeper had his work cut out on his return to the team and he was again forced to save a fierce shot from Ronaldo. At the opposite end, Robben, who left Madrid to join Munich, had motored towards goal on a solo run but his shot was safely collected by Iker Casillas, who later punched away another Bayern effort. Gareth Bale recovered from flu in time to replace Ronaldo in the later stage of the Champions League tie and the Welshman also forced a save from Neuer. But it was Bayern substitute Mario Gotze who almost had the last say with a powerful shot on goal only for Casillas to instinctively block his strike. The German side had a late appeal for a penalty turned down by English referee Howard Webb. Madrid will now travel to Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena next week with a slender advantage while Munich manager Pep Guardiola must work out how to make his team's possession pay. ""Everything is still possible in this tie,"" Bayern keeper Neuer told Uefa.com. ""We expect a similar game in the return leg. ""We have to keep focused and take advantage of our opportunities."" Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti, who along with Guardiola has lifted the European trophy as both a player and a manager, said: ""The fans helped the team a lot. The atmosphere was spectacular. We want to do everything we can to take them to Lisbon. ""We need everything in the second leg; sacrifice, courage, quality. We have a small advantage but nobody knows what will happen."" He added he expects both Ronaldo and Bale to be fully fit for next Tuesday's second leg. In the other semi-final, played on Tuesday evening, Chelsea and Atletico Madrid played out a goalless draw. An impenetrable defensive display from the Premier League side restricted the Spanish hopefuls to just a handful of chances. A place in the Champions League final in Lisbon on 24th May is still up for grabs as all four teams prepare to renew rivalries in next week's return legs.","Real Madrid edge out Bayern Munich in Champions League semi-final first leg .

"(CNN) -- As Michael Dunn, charged with murder in the killing of an unarmed black teenager, took the stand on Tuesday in his own defense, once again the nation focused on Florida, gun violence, and the evolution of self-defense. His testimony crystallized important points in this case. Dunn is not Zimmerman: We have to stop drawing comparisons between the Dunn case and that of George Zimmerman, accused of killing unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin. About the only thing in common between the two cases is that a human being lost his life, and another human being is the defendant. Oh, and John Guy, the prosecutor, who has had the roulette wheel of high-profile cases pick out his number twice in two years: He has been involved in both cases. But even then, the cases are nothing alike. Zimmerman's was a strong self-defense case. Dunn's is a comparatively weak self-defense case. Zimmerman fired one shot and waited around for the police. Dunn squeezed off 10 rounds -- then took off and got a pizza. The differences are so great that they should not be compared. Dunn is more significant for the self-defense issues raised in the case. Should Dunn have taken the stand? Many were surprised when Dunn took the stand in his defense -- conventional wisdom among defense attorneys is that defendants should not. After all, when was the last time a high-profile defendant did that? George Zimmerman certainly did not. The rules of evidence and testimony are a one-sided affair, in which the cross-examining prosecutor has all the advantages. If the prosecution cannot meet its burden, or the defense can make its case without the defendant's testimony, then there is often little to gain and much to risk in putting a defendant on the stand. Dunn's problem is that the prosecution has met its burden, and the defense cannot make its case without his testimony. In the Zimmerman case, the defense was able to establish the defendant's reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily harm through photos of his wounds. Sure, Zimmerman could have taken the stand to say ""I was scared,"" but the defense team made a risk analysis: If they already established objective evidence of his fear, they could avoid the massive risk of his being torn apart on the stand. In the Dunn case, there is very little objective evidence of an aggressor placing Dunn in fear of his life, so he had to tell the jury how afraid he was. Dunn's testimony, then, will largely determine whether these jurors find him guilty or not guilty. So what did we learn from his testimony? Opinion: Florida shooter saw black, thought 'threat' Preparation helps: Dunn's attorneys did a good job preparing him for his testimony. If Dunn did a bad job of hiding his preparation, a jury might see through that, but that's on Dunn -- not his lawyers. Notice how Dunn crowbarred the words ""death"" and ""imminent"" into his direct testimony. Remember, the jury instructions at the end of the case will have those words in them. The defense hopes the jury will make a connection with the judge's authoritative instruction on the law, and the defendant's own words about his state of mind, as in: ""Hey, the judge said he must have fear of 'imminent' harm, and he said the word 'imminent,' so he had the reasonable fear!"" Injecting these words also allows his attorneys to argue those facts in closing argument. Of course, merely stating a fear of imminent death does not make it a reasonable fear of imminent death, but words alone can have a subconscious effect. Flight as consciousness of guilt: ""The wicked man fleeth, when no man pursueth."" Proverbs 28. Dunn left the scene of this crime, and it will be critical to determine why. Flight to avoid prosecution may be considered ""consciousness of guilt"": evidence of guilt the jury may consider along with other evidence in the case. Of course, if he left for another reason, like fear for his life, then the flight is not as damaging. As with many things, we cannot look into Dunn's mind, so we have to evaluate circumstantial evidence, and now his own testimony. Dunn testified about being afraid of vengeance by ""local gangsters."" That's good strategy by his lawyers, to establish an ongoing fear that explains his fleeing the scene. However, the jury may have heard that instead as him stating his belief that trash-talking men of color are usually gangsters. Dunn may have missed the mark on this point, though his purpose was clear. Also damaging was his weak answer to the critical question: Why didn't you go to the police right away? His answer? ""I didn't think I did anything wrong."" Sir, you just shot up a Quik-E-Mart parking lot like the O.K. Corral. You may not think you did anything wrong, but don't you think the police might at least want to fill out some paperwork? Perhaps ask you a few questions? Strangely, Dunn's flight -- something he did after the killing -- may be the most damaging piece of evidence against him. The car filled with bullet holes: Dunn blasted 10 shots into the car. That's a problem for him. The jury is very likely to conclude that firing multiple shots is evidence of intent to kill or is a sign of excessive force. This is why Dunn's testimony needed to put the jury in the heat of the moment, to show them how fast shots are fired; how close the aggressor was; that an aggressor can keep approaching after one shot; and how long it takes in a deadly situation to realize that the threat is over. The defense needs to convince the jury that even after Dunn shot 10 times, really only a couple of seconds had elapsed and he still believed there was a real threat. Consider how different the case would sound to you if Dunn testified that he fired 10 shots over the wide span of a minute -- which he did not. What a contrast. A minute would make Dunn look like a cool, detached serial killer, who took his time executing unarmed victims. The number of shots is tied directly to the time it took to squeeze them off, which in turn is tied directly to the urgency of Dunn's actions. Dunn needed to score some major points here and bring the jury into the crisis and the moment with him. The verdict will show if he was successful. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Danny Cevallos.","Danny Cevallos: Michael Dunn's testimony highlights important legal points in his murder case .
Cevallos: Dunn is not George Zimmerman; his self-defense case is comparatively weak .

"London (CNN) -- Celebrity publicist Max Clifford was found guilty at a London court Monday of a series of indecent assaults on teenage girls, according to British police. Clifford, from Hersham, Surrey, is the first person to be convicted in an investigation into sex abuse allegations against the late British TV presenter Jimmy Savile. He was convicted of eight indecent assaults against young victims -- one as young as 15 -- cleared of two, and a jury could not reach a verdict on one other. The 71-year-old denied all 11 claims of sex abuse between 1966 and 1985, calling his arrest and prosecution ""a nightmare"" and declaring his innocence. But prosecutors portrayed him as an expert manipulator, according to media reports, vowing to help victims' careers and introduce them to celebrities for sexual favors. He was released on bail until his sentencing Friday, but Judge Anthony Leonard warned him all options were open to him, the Press Association reported. ""You must realize that the fact I have given you bail is no indication of what the final sentence will be,"" he said. Jenny Hopkins, deputy chief crown prosecutor in London, said: ""Today's verdicts provide a long-denied justice to the victims of serious sexual offences. ""I would like to thank these victims for having had the courage to come forward and give evidence. The victims of sexual abuse, whenever it may have taken place, should know that police and prosecutors will listen."" Clifford was arrested in December 2012 and charged in April 2013 on suspicion of sex offenses in connection with the investigation -- dubbed Operation Yewtree -- into numerous allegations made against Savile and others after a TV documentary that aired in October 2012. In the documentary, several people came forward alleging Savile abused them, unleashing a further flood of allegations against the star, who before that was seen primarily as an eccentric but charismatic man who raised millions of pounds for charity. Clifford is Britain's most famous celebrity PR consultant, renowned for his decades-long expertise in ""kiss-and-tell"" clients connected to English Premier League footballers and the world of pop and showbiz. He has also represented several controversial celebrities, including O.J. Simpson, Frank Sinatra and Simon Cowell.","Celebrity publicist Max Clifford found guilty of indecent assaults on teenage girls .

"(CNN) -- Alissa Welker would switch the lights on, off, on, off, on, off -- however many times it took to feel ""right."" When she was 9, she'd spend the equivalent of an adult workday doing these kinds of rituals. She also washed her hands excessively, avoided sick people and barely ate because she feared food poisoning. Mystery Almond has also felt that she needed to wash her hands more than most people, to the point that her classmates picked on her. She would see words spelled out in her head -- ""like reading a book"" -- telling her to do things, like hitting a girl in second grade who taunted her for obsessing over hand washing. Alissa, 17, and Mystery, 10, have different symptoms, but they both have had feelings of needing to act in certain ways that are out of the ordinary, as well as intense fears. These are signs of obsessive-compulsive disorder, which is thought to affect 1 in 100 kids, according to the International OCD Foundation. ""Sometimes I feel like, with my OCD, I feel sad. It feels like a darkness has overtaken me. It's a real bad feeling,"" said Mystery, of Coushatta, Louisiana. Parents, kids, teens, school personnel and mental health providers have a comprehensive resource for learning about pediatric OCD at the International OCD Foundation's new OCD in Kids website. It includes the personal stories of young people who have OCD, so that kids and teens can learn about their peers' experiences. The site launched this week for the organization's OCD Awareness Week, which culminates in a national event in Boston on Saturday that will be streamed live on the organization's website. Children as young as 3 or 4 can show signs of OCD, said Jeff Szymanski, executive director of the International OCD Foundation. But the onset is usually around ages 10 to 12 and the 18 to 22 age group. Boys tend to have symptoms earlier in life than girls. Symptoms include unwanted thoughts that produce fear and anxiety, and repetitive behaviors aimed at getting rid of those ideas. Doctors draw the line between normal childhood behaviors and signs of OCD when kids engage in repetitious behaviors that become time-consuming. Children may become fixated on thoughts that they just won't move away from. And they may not necessarily realize they're not acting normally. ""For the most part, adults realize that these symptoms don't make any sense. They get that this doesn't make a lot of sense,"" Szymanski said. ""Kids don't necessarily have that perspective."" A standard behavioral treatment for OCD is called exposure therapy, a kind of cognitive behavioral therapy aimed at decreasing anxiety associated with particular phenomena. For children, this often involves naming OCD as the ""bully or ""monster"" and chasing it away, Szymanski said. This helps kids deal with their scary, unwanted thoughts. Medication may also be prescribed. A recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that kids who had cognitive behavioral therapy for OCD, in addition to medication, tended to show more improvements than those who only took medication. Some kids get good treatment and never experience OCD symptoms again; others will have it throughout their lives, with some periods being better than others. It may go away in childhood and come back in adulthood. Alissa's mother, Vicki Gonzalez, had never heard of OCD before Alissa came to her and told her about these feelings. Gonzalez turned to the internet and discovered that Alissa's symptoms seemed to match up with that condition. At age 10, Alissa began seeing a therapist and starting taking sertraline, an antidepressant that's commonly prescribed for OCD. It's a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, a class of drugs that change the balance of the chemical serotonin in the brain. A turning point for Alissa was the International OCD Foundation conference in 2006 in Atlanta. Alissa really didn't want to go, but her mother coaxed her into attending. It was there that she met other young people with OCD whose symptoms had gotten better -- something Alissa didn't know was possible. ""Before I went to the conference, I didn't think it was possible to go from doing eight to 10 hours of rituals a day, to being symptom-free and living a normal life,"" she said. She liked the conference so much that she went back the following year, when it was in Houston, and met two girls who continue to be her best friends to this day. ""We understand each other, and we know we don't have to hide anything from each other. We don't judge each other for what's going on in our lives. We're always there for each other,"" she said. Exercise has also helped. Alissa is a varsity swimmer and swims year-round, and when her OCD got tough, she felt relief from stress in general by diving into her passion for the sport. These days, Alissa is a senior in high school and managing her OCD better than earlier in her childhood, although there are still ups and downs. Sometimes, she'll have months or years without symptoms, but this fall as she stressed about applying to college, she caught herself tapping her hand in specific numbers and having other unwanted thoughts. She still takes medication and goes to therapy every two to three months. Mystery's OCD journey began earlier, around age 5. She started having more outbursts, and the excessive hand washing and checking of locks on doors began. The writing in her head bothered her to the point that she couldn't sleep. At night she feared that some kind of ""mean animal"" or monster was outside her window and had vivid nightmares, from which she awoke crying. Other kids would pick on her when she would suggest that they also wash their hands before meals in the school lunchroom. Based on informal surveys, many OCD kids tend to report feeling bullied and say OCD interferes with schoolwork, Szymanski. Therapy and medication have also helped Mystery, who also has Asperger's syndrome, meaning she also has trouble with social interactions and repetitive behaviors. She has gone through several combinations of treatments before finding a mix that felt right: an antipsychotic, the antidepressant duloxetine, the antipsychotic ziprasidone and the ADHD drug guanfacine. ""I feel better. I'm more happy. I don't have to wash my hands as much, because I'm not really worried,"" she said. With her therapist, she has also talked about making friends and gets bullied less, although ""kids will be kids,"" she says. Mystery also has an occupational therapist and is undergoing equestrian therapy for Asperger's syndrome, which involves developing interpersonal skills through interacting with horses. ""We don't want to change her. We just want to help her understand the world a little better,"" her father, Vince Almond, said. ""She's not wrong or bad or anything like that. She's different."" In her spare time, Mystery writes poetry, sometimes about OCD. She will be reading from her poem ""Special and Proud"" on Saturday in Boston. Poetry, film give voice to OCD sufferers . She writes in this poem: . ""She is brave, . But sometimes she's afraid, . Of things she shouldn't be . She might get upset . And it's hard for her to forget . When she starts repeating things.""","Children as young as 3 or 4 can show signs of OCD .

"(CNN) -- A woman jogging at an Air Force base in Alaska on Sunday survived an attack by a brown bear sow defending its two cubs, the military said. The victim, who is the wife of a man stationed at the base and declined to be identified, walked a mile after she was mauled before a good Samaritan spotted her and took her to a hospital at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. The woman was listed in stable condition on Monday at Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage. According to CNN affiliate KTUU, the bear clawed the woman's arms, legs, neck and torso before leaving the site. The station reported the woman had the presence of mind to walk toward a populated part of the base even though it was uphill. Maj. Angela Webb, a spokeswoman for the Air Force, said the area is popular with runners and bicyclists, who are warned to bring bear spray. ""In this particular case, the runner turned the corner at the wrong time and wrong place,"" Webb said. The bear took a defensive pose, Webb said, before it went after the jogger. The woman had been jogging with her husband, but he had run ahead of her. It was the first bear encounter since 2010, when a bear went after four girls, three of whom played dead. The fourth ran to get help as the bear wandered away, Webb said. The Air Force Times reported that bears, moose and wolves are not rare at the base, which spreads across more than 74,000 acres.

"Seoul (CNN) -- Most South Korean students consider their final year in high school ""the year of hell."" It is when all students are put to the ultimate test. About 700,000 test applicants sat down in classrooms across the country Thursday to take their college entrance exams -- also known as the College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT). The stock markets opened an hour late, buses and subway services were increased and police cars offered rides for students, all to ensure they made it on time. Younger students gathered in large groups outside school gates, some having arrived at 4a.m. to mind a good spot, waiting to support their school seniors. Cheers exploded throughout the school grounds as test applicants arrived, most being guided by their anxious parents. ""I'm just praying for her. It's the same for all the mothers out here. They're just praying for the best,"" a mother said, as she stood across from the school long after her daughter had entered. ""I want to give her a hug when it's over and tell her she did a great job up until now,"" she added. For many, this one test -- which lasts a good eight hours -- will determine which university they enter. It is considered the chance to make or break one's future. In a country where more than 80% of high school students move on to higher-level education, getting into a prestigious school is all the more competitive. The final year leading up to the test is one of most intense periods students will ever experience. ""In South Korea, the reality is most students have lived for this very day. They have put in so much time and effort, and the fact that everything is decided on this one day can place an immense amount of pressure on them,"" a teacher from Paihwa Girl's High School, who had come to cheer on his students, said. Many test-takers will give up sleep, living sometimes on only five hours of rest a day throughout the year. Family members live nervously in fear that they will disrupt the mood of their high-school child. South Korea's obsession with education and academic success is rooted in Confucianism. The long practice of equating social status with academic achievement has left behind a tradition of pouring everything into studying. South Koreans on average spend 7.6 hours studying in the classroom, according to the country's former Education Minister Ahn Byong-man. From elementary school ages, South Koreans will spend many hours in cram schools after their regular classes. Almost 75% of the student population last year took up private education, according to the Ministry of Education. In order to reduce the financial burden from private education and encourage the students to rest, the current Lee Myung-bak administration placed a ban on operating private classes after 10pm. Government officials routinely patrol areas and crackdown on illicit classes. For a senior high school student, a study routine will include self-study sessions at school, cram school classes and more self-studying hours late into the night at private cubicles. This is all on top of their regular class hours. The psychological burden is such that South Korea suffers from high student suicide rates. More than 200 students committed suicide in 2009 and about 150 the following year, according to Ahn's Presidential Advisory Council on Education, Science and Technology. A heavy reliance on rote learning is also a challenge the country faces, as it tries to diversify its curriculum and reduce the stress from studying. ""It is a problem too that students learn a lot. They have a bunch of knowledge. They are well-equipped with good knowledge, I would say, but the process is so painful, they don't know how to enjoy learning from learning, you know,"" Ahn Byong-man said. The college entrance environment is better than it used to be in many ways. Some fortunate students will win a ticket to university without taking the CSAT through other recommendation programs. However, the importance of the CSAT still outweighs alternatives. More than 20% of the applicants to this year's test are high school graduates, also known as ""retakers."" Those who are unsatisfied with their test results this year will likely volunteer to live through another year of sleep-deprived nights.","The final year leading up to exams is an extremely intense period for students .

"(CNN) -- Football rivalry was put aside in Ukraine on Sunday as one player acted quickly to save the life of one of his opponents. Dinamo Kiev captain Oleh Husyev was left unconscious after colliding with Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk goalkeeper Denis Boyko in the first half of the Ukrainian Premier League match between the two teams.

"Jarratt, Virginia (CNN) -- Justice fell short with the execution of Washington-area sniper John Allen Muhammad, one of his victims' survivors said after witnessing his death by lethal injection. Muhammad died silently Tuesday night in a Virginia prison death chamber filled with lawyers, lawmen and his victims' survivors. After the execution, Steven Moore said he thought about Muhammad's accomplice, Lee Boyd Malvo, who received a life sentence for their crimes. ""Well, myself, I wish Malvo was right there beside Muhammad,"" said Moore, whose sister, FBI analyst Linda Franklin, was gunned down in Virginia. ""They both committed the same crimes. No, I don't feel any closure. I mean, it's ... it ... nothing changes."" Muhammad was the mastermind behind the Washington-area sniper attacks of 2002, which left 10 dead and terrorized the nation's capital. He was declared dead at 9:11 p.m. ET, said Larry Traylor, director of communications for the Virginia Department of Corrections. ""There were no complications,"" Traylor told reporters outside the Greensville Correctional Center. ""Mr. Muhammad was asked if he wished to make a last statement. He did not acknowledge this or make a last statement whatsoever."" In fact, Muhammad, 48, said nothing from the time he entered the death chamber accompanied by guards at 8:58 p.m., Traylor said. But in a statement read by one of his attorneys, Muhammad still denied he had committed the crimes. ""Mr. Muhammad maintains his innocence in this case, and he always has. He is not remorseful, although he does extend his condolences to the families. What these families went through is tragic in every level. Given the injustices in this case, what Mr. Muhammad went through is equally as tragic,"" said J. Wyndal Gordon, who was Muhammad's stand-by attorney in his Maryland trial, in which he represented himself. Moore said he had no sympathy for Muhammad and was angered by what he said were sympathetic media reports about Muhammad's children that had aired recently. ""They're talking about Muhammad's children, but Linda left children behind, too,"" Moore said. ""She's got a daughter, Katie, and a son, Thomas, that -- Tommy just got back from his second tour in Iraq in the Army. They're not going to see their Mom. So I don't have any sympathy for his family or for his children."" Bob Meyers, whose 53-year-old brother, Dean, was shot dead while pumping gas in Virginia, called Tuesday's execution surreal. ""Watching the life be sapped out of somebody intentionally was very different and an experience I'd never had,"" he said on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""I'd watched my mother die of natural causes, but that was very different."" He said he might have attained some closure, ""but I would say that pretty much was overcome just by the sadness that the whole situation generates in my heart. That he would get to the place where he did what he did, and that it had to come to this."" Meyers said he had forgiven Muhammad for two reasons: ""One is that God calls for me to do that in the Bible and the second thing is related to that. If I don't, it rots me from the inside out. It doesn't really hurt John Muhammad or anybody that I have bitterness against."" Among the witnesses to the execution were about a dozen members of the prosecution task force. ""He died very peacefully, much more than most of his victims,"" said Paul Ebert, the Virginia prosecutor who won the death penalty conviction. ""I felt a sense of closure, and I hope that they did, too."" The execution came hours after Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine denied a last-minute clemency request Tuesday for Muhammad. Kaine's announcement came a day after the Supreme Court declined to intervene in the case. During three weeks in October 2002, Muhammad and Malvo, then 17, killed 10 people and wounded three, while taunting police with written messages and phoned-in threats and demands. During two trials and in years of appeals, Muhammad professed his innocence. One of his trials included testimony from Malvo, whose youth excluded him from consideration for the death penalty. In a written statement issued earlier Tuesday, Muhammad's lawyer Jon Sheldon accused Virginia of racing to ""execute a severely mentally ill man, who also suffered from Gulf War syndrome, the day before Veterans Day."" Muhammad, who opted not to select a spiritual adviser, met during the afternoon with his immediate family and lawyers, said Traylor. He leaves four children and two ex-wives, both of whom appeared Monday on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" Muhammad's first wife, Carol Williams, showed a letter in which he asked her to visit him on his execution day. ""Carol, I miss my family for the past eight years,"" he wrote, referring to the time he was incarcerated. ""I don't want to be missed the day that these devils murder my innocent black ass."" Asked about his father, Lindbergh Williams said his feelings about the death penalty had not softened with the approach of the execution. ""If you commit a crime, you can pay the time,"" he said. Asked whether he thought his father regretted what he did, the younger Williams said, ""Yes, I really do."" Mildred Muhammad, the sniper's second ex-wife and the mother of three of his children, told CNN on Monday that she last saw him in 2001 at a custody hearing and had not sought to visit him in prison. ""I had emotionally detached from John when I asked him for a divorce,"" she said. ""And my emotions were severed when he said that you have become my enemy and, as my enemy, I will kill you."" CNN's Bill Mears contributed to this report from Jarratt, Virginia.","John Allen Muhammad is executed by the state of Virginia on Tuesday night .

"(CNN) -- It was supposed to be a formality, but the Netherlands was made to sweat against Costa Rica before eventually overcoming the 2014 World Cup's surprise package and booking a place in the semifinals Saturday. Substitute goalkeeper Tim Krul was the hero, saving two penalties to secure a 4-3 shootout victory after this tense, nervous quarterfinal finished goalless. Incredibly, the Newcastle man was brought on in the 29th minute of extra time with the sole job of denying ""Los Ticos"" in the spot-kick showdown. It earned the Dutch a second consecutive semifinals appearance, having lost to Spain in the title match four years ago. Now the aim for Louis van Gaal's men is to go one better than in South Africa. Standing in their way of another final appearance will be Argentina, which defeated Belgium in the day's earlier game thanks to a solitary early goal from Gonzalo Higuain. Wednesday's clash will be a repeat of the 1978 final, which Argentina won 3-1, and the dramatic 1998 quarterfinal in which the Dutch triumphed thanks to a spectacular Dennis Bergkamp winner. On the performances of both teams Saturday, it will be difficult to pick a winner. Belgium coach Marc Wilmots described Argentina as ""ordinary"" in his post-match press conference earlier in the day. Likewise, there was little that was obviously special about the Dutch against Costa Rica -- but Van Gaal's players have recorded some impressive results at this World Cup so far. A thrilling 5-1 demolition of reigning world champion Spain was followed up with two closely fought victories over Australia and Chile. The round of 16, meanwhile, produced a dramatic late win over an impressive Mexico side in the oppressive heat of Fortaleza. In Arena Fonte Nova, Salvador, the Oranje was faced with another Latin American opponent -- a Costa Rica team which was only the fourth side from the CONCACAF region to reach a World Cup quarterfinal. Solid defensive displays and tactical astuteness from its wily manager, Jorge Luis Pinto, had brought Los Ticos this far. Nobody expected them to get out out of a pool containing Italy, England and Uruguay, let alone as group winners. A heroic display with 10 men against Greece in the round of 16, winning a shootout, ensured Pinto's team would progress further than ever before. But in Van Gaal, Pinto had met his match. The Dutch master, who will take over the reigns at Manchester United once the World Cup is over, is one of the most celebrated European coaches of the last 30 years. Throughout the tournament he has switched his style, tactics and personnel depending on the demands of the opponents. A rapid counter-attacking style was deployed against Spain to devastating effect while striker Dirk Kuyt was effectively utilized as a defender against Chile to stifle the South Americans' impressive forward line. Here, Van Gaal adopted a similarly prudent approach. Both sides started cautiously, standing off and refraining from pressing until entering each other's territory. Whether this was down to a mark of respect or a pacing exercise in the Salvador heat was unclear, but the Dutch were the first to break the tentative rhythm. Robin van Persie was played through by Memphis Depay but Keylor Navas, who has performed admirably throughout the tournament, blocked low to his left before springing up to gather Wesley Sneijders follow-up. Moments later Navas was at it again, saving low from Depay who had been set up by Van Persie. Costa Rica had its own chances, though they were less clear cut. A series crosses peppered Jesper Cillessen's goal but there was little to concern the men in orange until a flick from Celso Borges bounced invitingly across goal with no Costa Rican striker to tuck home. The Dutch responded with a free kick from Sneijder that was spectacularly clawed away by Navas shortly after. After the break, both managers looked to break the stalemate by shuffling their pack. Marcos Urena replaced Joel Campbell up front for Los Ticos while the Dutch also made a striking change, taking off Depay for Jeremain Lens. Then, just as it seemed the game would never break from a crawling pace, it burst into life. Arjen Robben, who Costa Rica looked to double up on all night, burst forward and, despite accentuating what was minimal contact from Giancarlo Gonzalez, won a free kick on the edge of the box. Sneijder stepped up and rattled the post with a vicious swerving shot before the ball was eventually cleared. All of a sudden, the Dutch were energized and Los Ticos were rocking. Another free kick caused chaos in the Costa Rica box and the ball dropped to Van Persie, who fired in a shot that Navas again did well to block. As the clock struck 90 minutes the Dutch had their best chance of all as Daley Blind's low cross evaded everyone until it landed at the feet of captain Van Persie at the back post. The Manchester United striker struck the ball goalwards with Navas stranded but his shot was met by the retreating, Yeltsin Tejeda who somehow used his body to deflect the ball onto the bar and away. After what was for so long a sterile contest, the brief break before extra time barely seemed enough for the now clearly tiring players to catch their breath. The Dutch again started on the front foot as Navas made another fine save from a Ron Vlaar header. From the resultant corner, the keeper was almost caught out as he flapped at Sneijder's cross. Klaas Jan Huntelaar was introduced at the break for defender Bruno Martins Indi as Van Gaal attempted to avoid the dreaded penalty shootout. The striker, whose injury-time penalty won the day against Mexico,was soon booked for crashing into Navas when challenging for a high ball. Costa Rica threatened next as substitute Urena broke free at the edge of the box, working a yard of space before firing a low shot that Cillessen dived to push away. Even closer was to follow at the other end. As the clock ticked down, Sneijder peeled away at the far edge of the box before setting himself and unleashing another brilliant curling strike. For once Navas was helpless. But again the woodwork came to his rescue as the midfielder's shot bounced away of the crossbar. Penalties it would be -- but not before Van Gaal took the unorthodox decision to replace Cillesen with Krul for the shootout. ""There is no question about who will start next game, it will be Cillessen,"" Van Gaal said. ""But we felt Krul was the better choice here. ""We told Krul that he would be a possibility for the penalties, but we didn't tell Cillessen, as we didn't want to ruin his preparation."" It was a bold call that would prove decisive. Krul prowled around his area in an attempt to psyche out the Costa Rica penalty takers, pointing to his eye to let them know he'd done his homework. Maybe he had, maybe he hadn't. But his efforts to unnerve his opponents worked. Krul first dived low to his left to save from Bryan Ruiz and when Dirk Kuyt drilled the Netherlands' fourth spot-kick home, Michael Umana knew he had to score to keep his side in the competition. Sadly for Umana and the tiny Central American nation of five million souls, he couldn't, as Krul again went low to his left to push the spot-kick round the post and end the dream of these most valiant of underdogs. ""We cannot blame anyone because to be there at that time is not easy,"" said Navas, who was named man of the match for the third time at Brazil 2014. ""Our rivals did their job in the penalty shootout and we didn't."" Pinto admitted his team had been ""lucky throughout the game"" but expressed his great pride. ""We are not a world football power but we have done very important things here,"" the Colombian said. ""We go home proud of what we have done and I want to express my gratitude to the Brazilian people.""","The Netherlands into World Cup semifinals after defeating Costa Rica in Salvador .

"(CNN) -- Gordon Willis, the cinematographer whose expert use of light and shadow on such films as ""The Godfather"" and ""Manhattan"" earned him the nickname ""The Prince of Darkness,"" has died. He was 82. Richard Crudo, president of the American Society of Cinematographers, confirmed Willis' death to CNN. ""Gordon was one of the undisputed giants of the industry. He not only changed the way movies look, he changed the way the world looks at movies,"" Crudo said in a statement. ""His work on 'The Godfather' in 1972 and 'The Godfather Part II' in 1974 made everything we now accept as superlative cinematography possible. His influence over subsequent generations of artists will continue for all time. He will be sorely missed."" Indeed, Willis' handiwork helped set the tone for the 1970s ""New Hollywood"" renaissance -- led by directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, William Friedkin and Martin Scorsese -- and could have an incredible impact on his films. On ""The Godfather"" (1972), Coppola's epic gangster saga, Willis' dimly photographed, almost sepia-colored rooms and bright outdoors scenes added both historical shading and ominous mood-setting to what was intended to be a quickie take on Mario Puzo's bestselling book. Woody Allen's ""Manhattan,"" on the other hand, is a love letter to New York. There are few openings more thrilling than ""Manhattan's,"" which pairs Willis' photography of the city with George Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue."" ""He adored New York City. ... He romanticized it all out of proportion,"" Allen narrates, and the effect is transcendent. In a film such as ""All the President's Men"" (1976), Willis' cinematography was a literal illustration of the battle between the forces of light -- note the almost painfully bright Washington Post newsroom -- and darkness, as in the scenes in which Robert Redford meets Deep Throat in the gloomy parking garage. Jeff Cronenweth, the cinematographer for such David Fincher films as ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" (2011) and ""The Social Network"" (2010), noted that Willis was among a group (which included Cronenweth's father, Jordan) that changed American cinema. My father's peer group ""made the most headway of anybody: Conrad Hall and Gordon Willis and Vilmos Zsigmond and Owen Roizman. They came out of what was still pretty archaic, and they (made the most of) developing technology and color film, all the new tricks,"" he told CNN in 2012. Amazingly, Willis never won a competitive Oscar and was nominated just twice, for Allen's ""Zelig"" (1983) and Coppola's ""The Godfather Part III"" (1990). He was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2009 for ""unsurpassed mastery of light, shadow, color and motion."" He was a perfectionist who knew exactly what he wanted. ""On every movie I shot, I maintained strict developing and printing control -- everything was printed on one light,"" Willis told American Cinematographer magazine. ""I lit and exposed things at the level I wanted to be perceived on the screen; if you don't do that, anyone can decide what your work is supposed to look like, and I never believed in giving the studios that kind of flexibility."" Willis' other films included ""The Paper Chase"" (1973), ""The Godfather Part II"" (1974), ""The Parallax View"" (1974), ""Annie Hall"" (1977) and ""Presumed Innocent"" (1988).

"(CNN) -- Last week Airbus announced a squeeze which will make most frequent flyers groan, but today the European firm unveiled how passengers flying on its new A350 XWB might travel. Two test planes have been fitted out with full economy and business class interiors. The economy cabin has a nine-abreast configuration, with 18-inch wide seats, while business class has just four seats per row. Airbus boasts that the new, extra wide-body planes will have near-vertical walls and larger overhead baggage bins compared to its current fleet of aircraft. And for passengers with long legs, there shouldn't be any more issues with in-flight entertainment (IFE) boxes blocking the space under the seat in front of them; Airbus has placed all the electronic boxes and connections under the floor. Another innovation is the full cabin LED lighting that Airbus says can offer a mind-boggling 16.7 million possible colors. ""Passenger comfort is an increasingly important differentiator for the airline industry, becoming a fundamental deciding factor driving passenger choice and business success,"" said Chris Emerson, Senior Vice President of Marketing at Airbus. Read more: Would you pay to cut in line for toilets on a flight? If cabin interiors are a deciding factor for passengers when choosing an airline, then Airbus has also tried to make it easier for airlines to customize them. It has also opened a one-stop interiors showroom and test center in Hamburg, Germany. The Customer Definition Center has mock-up interiors of the A350 XWB with a full range of materials and fourth generation IFE consoles, plus a virtual reality modeling tool to help airlines visualize their choices. Airbus says that 39 airlines have placed orders for 812 A350 XWB jets, with three versions offering passenger capacity between 276 and 369 seats. The first will be delivered to Qatar Airways later this year. The mid-size, long-range jet is set to go head-to-head with Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and will be made of 53% composite materials.

"(CNN) -- It's an unreal scene, like one from a horror film. Here's how Tulsa World editor Ziva Branstetter described Oklahoma's botched execution on Tuesday of convicted killer Clayton Lockett: . • 6:28 p.m. Fifty milligrams of midazolam have been injected into each of Lockett's arms to start the process, an attempt to sedate him before the second and third drugs are administered to stop the breathing and the heart. Lockett has spent the past several minutes blinking and occasionally pursing his lips. • ...6:37 p.m. The inmate's body starts writhing and bucking and it looks like he's trying to get up. Both arms are strapped down and several straps secure his body to the gurney. He utters another unintelligible statement. Defense Attorney Dean Sanderford is quietly crying in the observation area. • 6:38 p.m. Lockett is grimacing, grunting and lifting his head and shoulders entirely up from the gurney. He begins rolling his head from side to side. He again mumbles something we can't understand, except for the word ""man."" He lifts his head and shoulders off the gurney several times, as if he's trying to sit up. He appears to be in pain. State officials reportedly were unsure how much of the second and third drugs that were supposed to kill Lockett were actually injected into his body. While the third was being administered, Lockett's vein ""exploded,"" Oklahoma Department of Corrections Director Robert Patton told reporters. He called the execution off. Then the inmate, Patton told the media, died of an apparent heart attack at 7:06 p.m. Perhaps some supporters of the death penalty find comfort in the fact that death by lethal injection is supposed to be painless -- more sterile than a firing squad, more clinical than the electric chair. For those people, perhaps, Oklahoma's botched execution will be a wake-up call -- a realization that all executions, regardless of method, are cruel and not especially unusual in parts of the United States. But in Oklahoma -- where both the firing squad and the chair are still statutory alternatives to the needle, if other methods were to be deemed unconstitutional by the courts -- method and morality don't seem to matter much. This is the state -- the state where I grew up, by the way, and where I once worked as a newspaper reporter -- that has the highest per capita rate of executions in the country. Nationally, support for the death penalty has declined from a high of 80% in the 1990s to only 60% now, according to Gallup. States such as Connecticut, Maryland and New Mexico recently have abolished this abhorrent practice. It's unclear if public opinion in Oklahoma mirrors the national trend, statistically, but anecdotal evidence suggests the state supports, if not celebrates, state-sponsored death. ""Give them a bonus!"" one commenter wrote on The Oklahoman's website, apparently referring to the executioner or state officials. ""I hope that man was in more pain than anyone ever imagined possible,"" a woman from Oklahoma wrote on Facebook, echoing a sentiment I saw repeated. Not everyone reacted this way, to be sure. But an outsider could be forgiven for seeing politicians in the state who support these unethical policies as death-hungry and vengeful. History would support that view as well. It was Oklahoma, after all, in 1977, that was the first state to authorize death by lethal injection. That decision was made, in part, because Oklahoma was ""facing the expensive prospect of fixing the state's broken electric chair,"" and lethal injections were cheaper, according to Human Rights Watch. It was Oklahoma, in 1988, that lost an argument before the U.S. Supreme Court that it should be able to execute a man who was convicted of murder at age 15. And it was Oklahoma, just this year, that executed a 38-year-old man, Michael Wilson, whose last words, just a moment before his death, were, ""I feel my whole body burning."" Yet, the state proceeded with Lockett's execution this week. And it did so, according to The Guardian, using ""dosages never before tried in American executions."" Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin was forced to show some sense when she ordered a stay of a second execution -- of convicted child rapist and murderer Charles Warner -- that was scheduled to occur after Lockett's on Tuesday. That a state was going to execute two men in one night drew international curiosity and condemnation. It rattled some feathers in Oklahoma, as there were protesters at the Capitol. But the governor and many residents were unmoved. No one would dispute that Lockett's crime was unthinkably heinous: He was convicted of shooting 19-year-old Stephanie Neiman before watching his accomplice bury her alive. But that doesn't excuse the state from ordering his death, especially in this way. Both Lockett and Warner's sentences had been contested in court, with attorneys for the inmates arguing that the state cannot withhold the exact source of the drugs it planned to use for the executions. A political circus ensued, and the court, in the view of Andrew Cohen, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, ""caved in to the political pressure."" Oklahoma Supreme Court Justice Steven Taylor wrote, in agreement with the court, that Lockett and Warner had no right to know the source of the chemicals. ""...(I)f they were being hanged, they would have no right to know whether it be cotton or nylon rope; or if they were being executed by firing squad, they would have no right to know whether it be by Winchester or Remington ammunition,"" he wrote, according to news reports. States have been scrambling to come up with drugs they can use to kill people since some drug makers stopped selling them for such purposes. Fallin has called for an investigation into the botched execution. As part of that, she should make the source of Oklahoma's drugs known. But Oklahoma seems to be a place hell-bent on secrecy. Near the end of the Tulsa World editor's journal of events, Ziva Branstetter writes that ""blinds are lowered"" and reporters were not allowed to see what happened in the final moments of Lockett's life. ""Reporters exchange shocked glances,"" she wrote at 6:39 p.m. ""Nothing like this has happened at an execution any of us has witnessed since 1990, when the state resumed executions using lethal injection."" Reporters were escorted to a white van outside the state penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma, which is commonly known as ""Big Mac."" They were told to leave their state-issued pens, Branstetter wrote. One could find hope in that moment -- could think that the state realizes that if witnesses saw what happened after the curtain fell, they would be shocked into action. That seems like a plausible explanation, but I still have my doubts. The death penalty is on its way out in America. But it's got a cold grip on Oklahoma.","Oklahoma botches first of two executions scheduled for Tuesday .

The United Nations reported more than 30,600 hectares (75,600 acres) of arable land was affected. Employees from humanitarian groups that operate inside North Korea describe severe malnourishment on a large scale. A deal earlier this year for the United States to ship food aid to the country fell apart after the regime went ahead with a controversial rocket launch. The highest numbers of deaths so far from the flooding were reported in areas of South Phyongan province, northeast of the capital, Pyongyang. The heavy rain Sunday hit Pyongyang as well as North and South Phyongan provinces. The capital is the richest and most developed part of the country, and is used as a showcase by the secretive, nuclear-armed regime.

"(CNN) -- I was born in Ethiopia, raised in Oklahoma and Colorado, and ended up in Brooklyn, New York. Coming to America from Ethiopia, a place where black and white were only colors that had little to do with race, I had to learn English, and also the language of identity. In America, I was black. So when some online commenters questioned whether Boston Marathon winner and Eritrean-American Meb Keflezighi is truly ""American,"" it reminded me of my own experience as an immigrant who became a naturalized American citizen and embraced a new identity. My parents, two brothers and I had an incredible life in Ethiopia. We always had the newest toys and clothes from my father's frequent work-related trips abroad. There were lots of friends and just as much family. Life was very communal, much like our style of eating. Of course, Ethiopia was not perfect, but it was all that I knew. My well-traveled parents wanted to grant my brothers and I the opportunities that America offered. Movies shaped my brothers' and my perception of America. As far as I was concerned, everyone lived in massive homes, owned multiple cars and was generally happier. The movie ""Coming to America"" stunned me the most. The images of homeless people and the rundown apartment occupied by the characters played by Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall contradicted the America of my imagination. In the weeks before leaving Ethiopia, my older brother Yoseph and I used to stay up late talking about how a group of welcoming American friends, a brand new American car and a huge American house would soon be ours. But landing in Oklahoma City, our expectations soon dissipated. From the thick, humid air that permeates Oklahoma in August to the instant feeling of being an outsider, we began to breathe less easy. In my fourth grade class, my peers were not as curious about me as I was about them. They avoided me and teased me for being African. I mostly attributed my peers' distaste for me to my country of origin, until the day my older brother Yoseph came home from school after getting into a fight with a boy. The boy had called him a ""nigger."" I soon realized it wasn't just because of our funny accents or nationality that people treated us differently. In America, we were seen as ""black."" I became painfully aware of my brown skin, my unruly hair, and the disapproving looks directed my way. And so my introduction to American culture began. By the time my family moved to Colorado, the outsized expectations of America were a distant memory. I felt I had a better grasp of American culture and my new black identity. My English was fluent, without a trace of an accent; it allowed me to socialize with less reluctance. I quickly made friends at my junior high school and became involved in extracurricular activities. I found comfort in having friends that looked like me. By the time I was a teenager, working weekends serving meals at a retirement home, I learned the difference between subtle and overt racism. There was a man there who refused to speak to me, let me take his order, or even look me in the eyes because I was black. It was understood that only my white co-workers would interact with him. The people I was close to would praise me by saying how well my parents raised me, and told me: ""You're not like the rest of them. You're different."" I almost thought that they said these things as a compliment. But I understood they were making an exception for me, in order to maintain their bigoted views of black and brown people. Because I defied the scope of their prejudice, I had to be unique. This infuriated me. I tried to take off-the-cuff comments from the elderly with a grain of salt. After all, they are from a different time period, when those sentiments were expected and accepted. But it was when I heard my peers say, ""You're not really black. You don't even act black,"" that I realized just how much the perceived singularity of the black identity transcends generations, age and gender. This made me embrace my ""blackness"" more passionately, and I began to identify more as ""black"" than Ethiopian. I wasn't quite Ethiopian enough for some of my Ethiopian friends who were convinced moving to the U.S. at such a young age caused me to lose some legitimacy. My vivid memories of Ethiopia and ability to speak my native language didn't cement my ""Ethiopian-ness"" to some. And I did not live up to my American peers' expectations of being African-American either, even after becoming a naturalized citizen. So there I was, the president of the Ethiopian Students Association, a member of the Black Student Alliance, and the founder of United Women of Color at Colorado State University. I became quite the skilled juggler. But it was exhausting. Tired of the balancing act, I began to care less and less about others' perceptions of me. Eventually, I became proud of not fitting neatly into someone else's definition of being black or Ethiopian. When I moved to New York, I felt at home, and met people with a similar understanding of black identity -- one that was varied and nuanced. They were more interested in having conversations about my experiences, and less interested in my color. I no longer felt the weight of defending all of the different aspects of my identity to everyone. But there is one thing about the black identity that remains constant: the complexities of the individual experiences that inform our identity. Yes, I am black. I am Ethiopian. I am American. I am also a journalist, a filmmaker, a sister, a daughter, a friend, an avid traveler and a woman who is constantly growing and evolving. There is no doubt that my experiences, at times turbulent, have contributed to my racial identity. But my identity is never static. Instead, it remains fluid. The reality is that my story is not singular simply because I was born abroad. It is distinctive in the way that each of us, as individuals, is distinct. And so are our identities. So when people say I am not ""really black"" or that Meb Keflezighi is not ""really American,"" I'd invite them to run a mile in each of our shoes -- to see what we've gone through to become as uniquely American as anyone.","Some have said Boston Marathon winner Meb Keflezighi is not truly American .

"(Mental Floss) -- 1. ""Für Elise"" Bob Dylan wrote ""It Ain't Me, Babe"" for Joan Baez. Written by: Ludwig van Beethoven . Written for: Some girl probably not named Elise. In fact, as far as most historians can tell, Beethoven didn't even know an Elise. Instead, the song was originally titled ""Bagatelle in A minor"" based on some handwritten notation a Beethoven researcher claimed to have seen on a now-lost copy of the sheet music. Further complicating things, Beethoven had hideous handwriting -- to the point that some scholars speculate the song was actually written ""for Therese,"" as in Therese Malfatti, one of several women who turned down a marriage proposal from the notoriously lovesick maestro. 2. ""Philadelphia Freedom"" Written by: Elton John & Bernie Taupin . Written for: Billie Jean King, as a thank-you for a tracksuit she gave Elton. And what a tracksuit it must have been! The 1975 song remains one of the most popular disco hits ever, leaving thousands of Hustle enthusiasts wondering just what Billie Jean King had to do with Philadelphia, anyway. Turns out, the song was a reference to King's pro tennis team, The Philadelphia Freedoms. Prior to 1968, tennis players were all considered ""amateurs"" and weren't eligible to receive prize money. So, if you didn't have the wealth to support yourself, you couldn't play. Billie Jean King fought against those constraints, ultimately founding Professional World Team Tennis in 1974 and turning tennis into a paid league sport. 3. ""Lola"" Written by: The Kinks' Ray Davies . Written for: A transvestite. But the question is, which one? According to Rolling Stone, ""Lola"" was inspired by Candy Darling, a member of Andy Warhol's entourage, whom Ray Davies briefly (and cluelessly) dated. If that's the case, then ""Lola"" is just another notch on Darling's song belt -- she's also referred to in Lou Reed's ""Walk on the Wild Side."" (""Candy came from out on the Island/ In the backroom she was everybody's darlin'."") But, in the Kinks' official biography, Davies tells a different story. He says ""Lola"" was written after the band's manager spent a very drunken night dancing with a woman whose five o'clock shadow was apparently obvious to everyone but him. 4. ""867-5309/Jenny"" Written by: Jim Keller (of Tommy Tutone) and Alex Call . Written for: Unknown, as the songwriters apparently make up a different story about its inspiration every time they're asked. While the woman continues to remain a mystery, however, the phone number is all too real. In fact, it's been wreaking havoc ever since 1982 and the passage of time hasn't quelled of the number of crank calls. In 1999, Brown University freshman roommates Nina Clemente and Jahanaz Mirza found that out the hard way, when the school adopted an 867 exchange number for its on-campus phone system. Immediately, the girls' innocuous Room No. 5309 became a magnet for every drunk college kid with a 1980s fetish. Other unfortunate phone customers have fought back with creative and profitable solutions, like the holder of 212-867-5309, who put his phone number up for auction on eBay in 2004. Bids approached $100,000 before eBay pulled the item at the request of Verizon, the number's actual owner. 5. ""Oh, Carol"" Written by: Neil Sedaka . Written for: Carole King, naturally. Sedaka and King actually dated briefly in high school -- a romance Sedaka was able to successfully milk with ""Oh, Carol,"" a then top-10 (if now somewhat forgettable) 1959 pop song. However, the real success of ""Oh, Carol"" came a few months later, when it inspired King to write a rebuttal entitled ""Oh, Neil."" At the time, King and her husband, Gerry Goffin, were fledgling songwriters in need of a hit tune. ""Oh, Neil"" wasn't that, but it did pay off. After Sedaka gave a tape of the song to his boss, King and Goffin landed jobs at the legendary Brill Building pop music factory, where the duo went on to write chart-toppers like ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"" and ""The Loco-Motion."" 6. ""It Ain't Me, Babe"" Written by: Bob Dylan . Written for: Joan Baez, though it clearly wasn't the nicest gift Dylan could have given her. The two met in 1961, when Baez was an up-and-coming folk singer and Dylan was a nobody from Minnesota. Desperate to make his break in the music biz, Dylan worked like crazy to get Baez's attention. He eventually ended up going on tour with her, which is how he first became famous, and also how the two began dating. For a while, they seemed like the golden couple, but things soon went downhill. During a European concert tour together in early 1965, they had a huge fight and parted ways. That May, Dylan was holed up in a hotel after being hospitalized with a virus, and Baez, hoping to remain friends, decided to bring him flowers. Sadly, that's how she found out that her ex was already dating someone else. That someone else was Sara Lownds, whom Dylan married a mere six months later. 7. ""Our House"" Written by: Graham Nash (of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young) Written for: Joni Mitchell. In December 1968, Nash and Mitchell moved into a cozy little house in the Laurel Canyon section of Los Angeles. Though commonly left out of the hippy pantheon, Laurel Canyon was sort of a commune-home away from commune-home for San Francisco society -- not just CSN&Y, but also Jim Morrison, the Eagles, Frank Zappa, and more. ""Our House"" was directly inspired by a lazy Sunday in the Nash/Mitchell household. The couple went out to brunch, hit an antiques store, and then returned to find the house just a bit chilly, at which point Nash literally ""lit a fire,"" while Mitchell ""placed the flowers in the vase that she bought that day."" No, really. The whole tableau seemed so ridiculously domestic to Nash that he immediately sat down and spent the rest of the day writing about it. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Last month I joined Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson to watch the Los Angeles Clippers and Golden State Warriors at the Staples Center, and I became immersed in the excitement of a great NBA game. My excitement would later turn into disappointment and anger as a result of the controversial statements made by Clippers owner Don Sterling. All of his statements are troubling, but his most recent -- that Magic Johnson hasn't done anything to help the black community -- is just dead wrong. That Sterling -- who has until May 27 to respond to the NBA's charges and efforts to terminate his ownership rights -- equates help with handouts shows his flawed and outdated understanding of charity and philanthropy. While Sterling gave an inconsequential amount of cash to the L.A. chapter of the NAACP to help dilute his well-documented record of racism, Magic used his millions to bring economic development to struggling black communities, to create businesses and jobs, to encourage black entrepreneurship and to inspire other black businessmen and businesswomen to invest in inner cities. The protracted discourse this country has been having about race and the NBA offers a real opportunity to foster a more long-term solution to the economic disparity in black communities. The NBA and players should work together to create more pathways to team ownership and more business opportunities across the league's supply chain for African-Americans and other minorities. This would be good not only for the league and players, but for minority businesses, fans, and the many youngsters who aspire to sports careers. I can't think of a better person to help lead such efforts than Magic. What Sterling doesn't understand, but Magic does, is that ""help"" in the 21st century economy is about investing in people and communities so that they can become economically empowered. It's about providing opportunities that can make individuals more financially independent and make black families more financially solvent. It's about creating businesses that bring money into black communities, and keeping the money there. Opinion: The 5 apology rules that Sterling broke . Unlike many professional athletes, Magic has always understood the economic impact of sports and sought to extend his financial clout to the broader community. As he said in a recent interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, ""My whole life is devoted to urban America. We go back and educate others on how they can be successful. It's not about giving them money. It's about giving them tools."" Whether through real estate investments, Magic Johnson Theaters, restaurants, fitness centers, sports teams or Starbucks franchises, Magic has been transforming urban centers and in doing so may attract other businesses that wrote off black communities and their buying power. Over the last three decades, startups by entrepreneurs -- companies less than five years old -- have accounted for most of the new jobs in the private sector. Arguably, the scarcity of these new, dynamic, fast-growing companies in black communities has contributed to some of the chronic unemployment we see today, the very joblessness that often lies at the root of so many of our broader social problems, from drug dealing and gang violence to neighborhood decay and broken families. These challenges defy easy solutions. However, a new corner store here or a barbershop there can't create widespread economic opportunity. Targeted government programs can help, but long-term, private-sector investment is absolutely critical for economic sustainability. Magic understood early on the business of basketball. He leveraged his relationships and successfully made the transition from athlete to entrepreneur. He is an important role model to youngsters who are eager to be successful in sports but clueless about how to get there. Opinion: Sterling apology was an epic fail . I witnessed firsthand the sway that Magic had as a surrogate during the 2008 presidential race, when I was a senior adviser to the Obama campaign, coordinating the involvement of many athletes and entertainers. Young people responded enthusiastically to Magic, energized by their hero and the prospect of a young black president who played ball himself. Few of these young people will become NBA players, but lots can own businesses. Magic represents an important nexus between the little boys who play on the neighborhood basketball courts and the big boys who play on Wall Street. His entrepreneurship represents the bridge from poverty to prosperity. Other professional athletes can build bridges, too, but they have to see themselves as modern-day entrepreneurs with real power to make a difference, as comfortable speaking in corporate boardrooms as they are playing ball, and as interested in owning businesses as they are in being big-ticket consumers with expensive homes and cars. The NBA generates over $4 billion annually and the top 10 players reportedly earn a combined $200 million dollars combined each year. With that kind of money they can afford to invest in high-growth companies in energy, technology and advanced manufacturing that create high paying jobs. Athletes also can challenge companies whose products they endorse to locate manufacturing and distribution facilities in distressed urban areas. While they're at it, they should certainly work towards pooling their resources, buying teams, and ensuring a culture of diversity, integrity and mutual respect. Unlike Don Sterling's shameful and insincere attempts to buy credibility in the black community, that's something the players' millions can actually attain.

"Rio de Janeiro (CNN) -- Women shake their hips seductively and children dance in flip-flops to booming electronic music while young men brandish pistols and the occasional assault rifle. It's just another funk party in one of the lawless favelas on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. Since 2008, when authorities launched a so-called ""pacification"" effort, police have stormed dozens of slums to squeeze out criminal gangs and make the city safer for residents as well as the hundreds of thousands of tourists expected for the World Cup, which starts next month, and the 2016 Olympic Games. Initially, police targeted shantytowns closest to tourist hot spots, the iconic favelas that cling to hills overlooking Copacabana and Ipanema. But far from the sunny beaches and pretty promenades that line the coast, drug gangs still reign supreme. Even during the day, the drug business is brisk and carried out in the open. Armed men, often just teenagers, stand watch at corners and communicate by radio as housewives, workers and children coming home from school walk by. Sales are made from a plastic table erected on a corner, piled with little baggies of marijuana, hashish, cocaine, crack, even an inhalant containing ether. Money is stuffed in plastic containers. The local dealers agree to talk while they carry on with their trade. ""What we sell most is the famous white powder, the 20-real hits,"" says Jorge as he holds up little baggies of cocaine, worth about $8. A hit of crack costs about $2 and a baggie of marijuana about $4. They say most of their customers are locals, but they increasingly have more clients coming from Rio's wealthier neighborhoods because of the heavier police presence there. Jorge, 22 with bleached hair, wears board shorts and flip-flops and has an AR-15 slung over his shoulder. ""I was born in the middle of trafficking. I didn't see any other alternative,"" he says. ""If I could choose a profession, I would be a fireman or a doctor."" For decades, Rio's favelas were neglected by authorities, considered no-go zones even by police. Rival drug gangs fought for control. They became judge, jury and executioner -- and a part of daily life. Jorge says: ""If I told you I wasn't afraid of dying it would be a lie. If I told you I avoided death, it would be a lie. I wouldn't be here trafficking if it were true."" But he says he thinks the greater police presence would make life worse for his community. Under the controversial pacification program, police have reduced crime and killings in the communities where they have seized control from drug gangs, but they have also come under fire for strong-arm tactics and excessive violence. In some cases they have been accused of murder. Police are investigating some allegations but say they are isolated incidents. In the hundreds of far-flung shantytowns that haven't yet been included in the program, feelings are mixed. A community organizer, who asked not to be named, said a police presence should just be the first step for greater participation in city life. ""What we need here are opportunities for our young people, like job training and internships,"" he said. ""The police just come in here wanting to break heads."" But for Wagner, a former trafficker now interned at a drug rehabilitation shelter, pacification would be a way for his community to break free. ""My community lives in a constant war zone. There are people who support the traffickers, but they always want something in exchange: They want your son or they want you to leave your door open so they can escape from the police. They always want something,"" he says. But most people seem to agree that the police first have to convince communities they won't just pack up and leave once the World Cup and Olympics are over.","Drug gangs still reign in Rio shantytowns that haven't seen pre-World Cup crackdowns .

"(CNN) -- It's been a year since the United States ratified the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia, and it's time to reflect on its benefits. By allowing us to restart inspections, verifications and the dismantling of nuclear assets, New START has established transparency, predictability and stability that serves the security of the whole world. We know what the Russians have, and they know what we have, and together we are reducing our arsenals, allowing us all to sleep easier. Keeping in mind the success of New START, the next logical step would be to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), as Russia did in 2000. The establishment of such a ban on nuclear testing would further strengthen American security. START I was first proposed by President Reagan. The United States and the Soviet Union signed the agreement in 1991, enhancing stability between the two nations and allowing for a drastic reduction in nuclear weapons. After the dissolution of the USSR, the treaty was inherited by Russia and continued until its expiration in December of 2009. The expiration of the treaty risked a new arms race that threatened the security gains of the past 17 years. Succeeding the original agreement, New START is the modern recognition that both our nations benefit by fostering transparency between our two strategic nuclear forces. It is no secret that during the course of the Cold War, the United States and Soviet Union developed the nuclear capacity to destroy each other, and indeed the very existence of humanity, several times over. At the height of that conflict, the United States and USSR possessed more than 65,000 nuclear weapons between them. Nuclear strategy promoted the concept of ""bouncing the rubble,"" signifying the premise of destruction that nuclear war would unleash. Yet this era demands thinking outside the conventions of nuclear war. We need weapons for fighting the enemies of today, not the Soviets of yesteryear. In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, our greatest threat has not been nuclear weapons fueled by uranium, but buried homemade bombs fueled by fertilizer. Investments in equipment, technology and training designed to combat low technology threats have proven more decisive in protecting the lives of our troops than any of our nuclear assets. Of course, the United States can and should maintain a strong, credible nuclear deterrent. It also can and should set an example for the rest of the world with responsible ownership of these weapons. After conducting more than 1,000 nuclear test explosions, the United States has not explosively tested a nuclear weapon in nearly 20 years and instead maintains a stockpile stewardship program to ensure the reliability of the current arsenal. Still the U.S. Senate resists approving the test ban treaty, which would create worldwide networks to apply pressure against states like Iran and North Korea. These networks of pressure are exactly what we need against rogue states that aren't deterred from nuclear development by the vast American arsenal. These states are more susceptible to pressure outside the nuclear realm, and our strategy must incorporate this understanding to be effective. This means taking a bold diplomatic leadership role. By ratifying the CTBT, at no consequence to our own nuclear capabilities, the United States further establishes an international norm that pressures Iran and North Korea to ratify the treaty as well. We no longer need to test, but these states do in order to bridge their knowledge gaps. The success of New START exemplifies the kind of diplomatic leadership the United States must embody. America became a reluctant global leader in the 20th century. But with global power comes global responsibility. Thrust onto the world stage in periods that demanded leadership, we have seen the consequences of American reluctance to lead. The 21st century is a time of new challenges, be those challenges of economic, environmental or military nature. Leadership doesn't have to be expensive, and there are clear budgetary incentives for reducing our Cold War nuclear arsenal. As commentators discuss the decline of American influence in the world, we must focus on the power of our example as a staple of international leadership and that means active participation in diplomatic processes and organizations. Americans firmly believe in their commitment to ideals, principles and morality. New START is supremely representative of that. We should extend that commitment to ratification of the CTBT. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Cheney.","Stephen Cheney: New START treaty has provided stability for the whole world .
Next step is ratifying the test ban treaty, he says, signed by Russia a decade ago .
Cheney: U.S. no longer needs to test nuclear weapons; threat today is homemade bombs .
Signing would help us in pressing rogue states to pledge not to test nukes, he writes ."
"(CNN) -- Add yet another reason to consider Brazilians the world's coolest nationality. They take their national soccer team's plane for the World Cup and turn it into a work of brilliant graffiti art. Identical twins and breakdancers-turned-graffiti artist duo Os Gemeos used 1,200 cans of spray paint to emblazon their signature colorful style over a Boeing 737. Known for the yellow-skinned characters they've said are influenced by their dreams, Octavio and Gustavo Pandolfo are among Brazil's most popular contemporary artists. Brazilian low-cost carrier GOL commissioned the plane, which will fly the Brazilian national soccer team around the country during the FIFA World Cup starting June 12. Although they didn't have the World Cup in mind when they first envisioned the project, the idea to paint the plane came from the artists themselves, said the twins in an interview with artnet. The design theme the twins were tasked with were ""Brazilianness, democracy and diversity."" The plane will be part of the GOL fleet for an additional two years after the World Cup.

"(CNN) -- ""The Normal Heart,"" written by my friend, the brilliant playwright Larry Kramer, and based on his story during the earliest days of the AIDS epidemic, tells a tale that many of us lived through, and many others did not survive. It's as relevant today as an HBO movie as when it premiered on the stage in New York City in 1985. Back then, The New York Times refused to print the word ""gay,"" and New York Mayor Ed Koch was agonizingly slow to respond to the unfolding epidemic. Fear was everywhere. Around the country, family members shunned infected relatives, doctors were afraid to touch AIDS patients, let alone treat them, and hospital wards filled up with young men covered in lesions, dying excruciating deaths. I've almost lost track of the number of funerals I went to in those years. My friends were dying all around me -- I'm lucky that I somehow survived. ACT UP, the coalition that Larry founded to address the crisis, coined the phrase ""silence equals death"" as its rallying cry, and it was no exaggeration. By the end of 1983, AIDS had claimed 2,100 lives, but the government would hardly acknowledge that anything was awry. I can't help but wonder, if those in power had cared more, if they had done more, perhaps we could have ended this epidemic before it began to circle the globe. But they didn't care, they didn't act, and 36 million people have died of AIDS since. Worldwide, another than 1.6 million people will die of AIDS this year. In the United States, there will be roughly 50,000 new infections. While The Normal Heart is a product of a specific time, it is not an artifact. There is still an AIDS crisis -- not only in sub-Saharan Africa, but right here in the America, in your state, in your community. And, just as in 1985, it is silence, fear and stigma that continue to drive the epidemic. Today, African-Americans represent 12% of the national population, but they account for 44% of Americans living with HIV, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Gay and bisexual men comprise only 2% of the American population, but they represented 30% of the nation's HIV infections in 2010. Around 4,000 Americans are infected with HIV each year because of injection drug use, and one in seven HIV-positive Americans pass through a correctional facility each year. The crisis is particularly acute in the American South, where homophobia is rampant. I hope HBO's production of ""The Normal Heart"" will compel a new generation to act up. There is so much work still to be done, but there's also so much potential. The characters in ""The Normal Heart,"" living as they did in the 1980s, didn't understand what they or their friends were dying of, and they didn't have treatments to manage the disease. They hardly knew how to protect themselves. Today, we know how to protect everyone, and we have the ability to treat every single person living with HIV. Yet AIDS continues to prey upon the most vulnerable in our society: the poor, the incarcerated, sex workers, drug users, and those living in regions where intolerance and stigma are facts of life. Today, as ever, silence equals death. Elton John uses photography to fight AIDS . As Larry so forcefully taught us nearly 30 years ago -- and as he and Ryan Murphy, the director of the new HBO film, continue to remind us today -- we must speak out against injustice, act with compassion, and fight for equality. If enough of us raise our voices, we can finally begin to end this epidemic. Editor's Note: HBO, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.","Elton John: In the 1980s, newspapers wouldn't use term ""gay,"" AIDS was ignored by many .

"Islamabad, Paksitan (CNN) -- Life is slowly getting back to normal at the women's campus of Islamabad's International Islamic University. The young women who study here chatter on the school's well-manicured lawns, their brightly-colored scarves and Pakistani dresses blowing in the wind on a sunny autumn day. Barely three weeks ago, this quiet place of learning was the scene of a nightmare. On October 20, two suicide bombers launched near simultaneous attacks on both the men's and women's side of the campus. Afsheen Zafar, 20, is in mourning. Three of her classmates, girls she describes as ""shining stars,"" were killed on that terrible day. Still, she says the carnage could have been much worse if not for the actions of a lowly janitor, who was also killed. ""If he didn't stop the suicide attacker, there could have been great, great destruction,"" Zafar says. ""He's now a legend to us,"" says another 20-year-old student named Sumaya Ahsan. ""Because he saved our lives, our friends' lives."" The janitor's name was Pervaiz Masih. According to eyewitness accounts, the attacker approached disguised in women's clothing. He shot the guard on duty, and then approached the cafeteria, which was packed with hundreds of female students. Masih intercepted the bomber in the doorway, however, and the bomber self-detonated right outside the crowded hall, spraying many of his explosive vest's arsenal of ball bearings out into the parking lot instead of into the cafeteria. ""The sweeper who was cleaning up here saw someone outside and went towards him,"" said Nasreen Siddique, a cafeteria worker who was wounded in the head, leg and arm by the blast. ""[Masih] told him that he could not come inside because there were girls inside. And then they started arguing. And then we heard a loud blast and all the glass broke."" ""Between 300 to 400 girls were sitting in there,"" said Professor Fateh Muhammad Malik, the rector of the university. ""[Pervez Masih] rose above the barriers of caste, creed and sectarian terrorism. Despite being a Christian, he sacrificed his life to save the Muslim girls."" Masih was a member of Pakistan's Christian minority, traditionally one of the poorest communities in the country. When the attacker struck, Masih had been on the job for less than a week, earning barely $60 a month. Masih lived with seven other family members, in a single room in a crowded apartment house in the city of Rawalpindi. Until the attack his mother, 70-year old Kurshaid Siddique, worked as a cleaning lady at a nearby house to help make ends meet. Now, she makes a daily pilgrimage to the cemetery where Masih is buried. Siddique is inconsolable. Asked if she was proud that some people were calling her son a hero, Siddique waved a hand in the air dismissively, answering, ""My hero is dead now."" She pulls out a framed photo of her son, pictured wearing a button down white shirt and a thick mustache. When Masih's three-year-old daughter Diya sees his photo, she reaches for it, saying, ""Mama, I want that picture."" From time to time, Diya turns to her mother and repeats one word, ""Papa."" The Islamic University offered to give Diya a free education and employ Masih's widow, Shaheen Pervaiz. Meanwhile, the Pakistani government has promised to award Masih's family 1 million rupees (about $12,000) for his bravery. ""He is a national hero because he saved the life of many girls,"" said Shahbaz Bhatti, minister of minorities in the Pakistani government. ""As a Christian, a person of minority, he stood in front of the Taliban to protect the university."" But the grave of this national hero is a sorry sight. It is located in the poorer, garbage-strewn Christian half of a neighborhood cemetery, less then three feet from a muddy road. Masih's mother and widow visit every day. One of his sisters crosses herself, then stoops down to pick up an empty pack of cigarettes someone threw onto the little mound of earth. The family had to borrow money to pay for Masih's funeral and they are now behind on paying the rent. If the government money comes through, Masih's mother would like to decorate her son's grave. ""I would like him to have his name in cement with a nice poetry verse,"" she says. ""And there should be a fence surrounding his grave.""","Janitor Pervaiz Masih lauded as national hero after attack at Muslim university .

"(CNN) -- Ex-Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick and his former treasurer got more than $125,000 in free travel and entertainment from an investment firm that made $3 million handling city pension funds, federal regulators said Wednesday. A lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission accuses Kilpatrick and former city Treasurer Jeffrey Beasley of soliciting the gifts from MayfieldGentry Realty Advisors, which regulators say picked up the tab for trips to Las Vegas, Bermuda and Florida on private jets. Beasley told the firm's owner, Chancey Mayfield, that his company was ""in the doghouse"" with Kilpatrick's administration after Mayfield backed Kilpatrick's opponent in the 2005 election, the lawsuit states, and Beasley offered to help Mayfield ""clear the air"" with the mayor. ""At the same time Mayfield and MGRA secretly provided these gifts, they were seeking approval from the trustees of the funds, including Kilpatrick and Beasley, for over $115 million in investments,"" the lawsuit states. ""The failure by Kilpatrick, Beasley, MGRA, and Mayfield to disclose these gifts and the resulting conflicts of interest constituted a fraud on the pension funds."" There was no immediate response to the lawsuit from the defendants Wednesday afternoon. MayfieldGentry's phone was out of service, and the company's website was offline. Kilpatrick was forced to resign in 2008 in a scandal over his attempt to cover-up of an extramarital affair. He served three months in jail for assaulting a police officer who was attempting to serve a subpoena on one of his friends, then served another 14 months in prison for violating probation.

"(CNN) -- Scatha, a 15-year-old Komodo dragon, and five other reptiles died Monday after smoke from a fire filled an enclosure at the San Antonio Zoo, a spokeswoman for the zoo said. In a written statement, Libby Castillo said two Amazon tree boas, two Solomon Island skinks and a Red Mountain Racer also perished. Almost 100 other animals were saved. ""Everybody's got, sort of, a lump in their stomach about it,"" zoo director Steve McCusker told CNN affiliate KSAT. ""It'll affect us, and there will be some really cool stuff off exhibit for a long time that the public won't get to enjoy."" The cause of the fire was unknown, but a heating device may be to blame, the zoo said. Firefighters faced unusual circumstances at the scene, CNN affiliates reported. According to KABB, there were 25 to 45 poisonous snakes in the enclosure. And there was a 22-foot-long, 350-pound reticulated python named Bernice that had to be carried to safety, said KSAT. The zoo said it will take six to eight months to repair the Komodo exhibit. Scatha's mate, Bubba, was rescued as were 92 other lizards and snakes.","Animals died of smoke inhalation, fire department says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Local businesses will have more opportunities to advertise on TV in Mississippi after polls close Tuesday night, capping a contentious GOP Senate primary race marked by a flood of outside spending -- the most of any other primary battle this election season so far. Sales managers at Mississippi TV stations said huge ad buys from PACs and super PACs have strained the state's top advertising markets. Spending from these groups during this cycle produced an increasingly common scenario around the country: advertising costs rose and local businesses were pushed out of their programming slots or forced to shell out a higher price to stay on air. Bolstered by the ""Citizens United"" 2010 Supreme Court ruling that removed barriers for corporations to make unlimited donations to groups supporting or opposing individual candidates, independent organizations outspent candidate campaigns. In Mississippi, they dropped more than $6 million to advertise on broadcast and cable TV, according to FEC filings and data provided by the National Cable Company, which helps advertisers target specific demographics. Negative political ads have come to embody the contentious battle between Sen. Thad Cochran and his tea party challenger, Chris McDaniel, and the millions of dollars in added revenue are a financial boon for local stations. Complicating relationships . But the tremendous cash flow has also complicated longstanding relationships with regular advertisers, said Jeff Wolfe, general sales manager of Jackson's WAPT TV, a CNN affiliate. ""In some cases they have not been able to buy and in other cases schedules that were placed a while ago have been disrupted because of the sheer tonnage and the higher rates,"" Wolfe said. ""We pride ourselves on managing our inventory and trying to anticipate as best we can, but the spending has been so substantial that no one would have imagined this a few months ago,"" he added. Outside groups spent about $1.2 million on ads in Jackson alone during the first leg of the primary, Wolfe said â€” and even a slice of that figure is hard to pass up. Wolfe said he has done his best to ""spread the pain"" among advertisers and is planning a charm offensive after the runoff election to recoup clients who were temporarily forced out of their slots. ""We haven't lost anyone totally,"" Wolfe said. ""(But) it's always a concern that people would look for other means to advertise. We realize that clients have a lot of options."" A few top ad agencies in Mississippi said their clients haven't been pushed off the air, but that's because they locked in their air time far in advance or recommended that businesses hold off on TV ads until after the primary. In some cases, advertising agencies push their clients toward digital advertising during jam-packed election cycles, said Philip Shirley of Godwin Group, a Jackson-based advertising agency. And his clients are also keenly aware of the market pressures, he added. ""It's very clear that the market has tightened up,"" Shirley said. ""Our buyers seemed a little bit apprehensive about how much flexibility they would have right now, in terms of getting exactly what they would want."" The situation continued after the race was pushed to a runoff when Cochran and McDaniel each failed to cross the 50% threshold in initial primary balloting. Since, outside groups parachuted into Mississippi with nearly $2 million to put more spots on TV. Unheralded candidate believes he played spoiler in Mississippi primary . Keith Kinkade, a Jackson retailer who owns Kinkade's Fine Clothing, said he decided not to push out his usual Father's Day ad rollout after the primary results came in. ""I found out about it and I'm like, 'I'm not going to get in the middle of that,'"" he said. Keith added he was concerned people might associate his business with either camp if his ad followed a political spot -- or was sandwiched between two. ""You can't lean for one football team or another,"" he said. Beyond Jackson . Stations in smaller markets have also seen a surge of political ads. Sherry Nelson, general manager of several small TV stations in Greenville in the Delta, said political spending has been a financial windfall. ""First quarter was pretty down for us in the marketplace. It has helped our second quarter tremendously with the outside spending,"" she said, adding that four different issue groups and one campaign purchased ads in Greenville. The northeastern Mississippi city of Tupelo saw about $500,000 in political spending -- mostly from outside groups -- injected into its TV ad space. The cash flow funneled in by interest groups on top of the campaigns has generated the highest revenue the station has seen in the past three years, Jay Richer, general sales manager at Tupelo's WTVA, said. But as in Jackson, the increase in spending also forced stations into a corner. Richer said he was been able to shield some of his regular customers from the disruptions of the political cycle, but about 10% of them have been pushed off the air, he said. ""We're able to accommodate some. But others, their schedules are just ruined -- especially if they buy during the newscasts,"" which offer prime real estate for political groups, he said. The Mississippi GOP race is even extending into neighboring Tennessee, with about $925,000 in political ad buys in Memphis, of which only one-third came from the two campaigns. Memphis TV stations dominate northern Mississippi, serving DeSoto County, the third largest in Mississippi. And even in that top 50 TV market, political ads have disrupted schedules and impacted local clients. Politics: A money game . The Federal Communications Commission not only ensures that candidates have easy access to the TV market, but guarantees campaigns for federal office the lowest rate available. And while super PACs and PACs are not guaranteed the same right to air time, the groups' deep pockets can get their spots on TV just as effectively as an FCC regulation, said Tim Kay, the National Cable Company's director of political strategy. ""You get into those sold out situations and there are opportunities for them to pay more to remove a commercial advertiser,"" he said. ""When they're coming in and they want to influence the election in the last three, four weeks, they often do pay the higher rates."" Chamber mounting new effort for embattled Cochran . The outsized spending impact of interest groups has resulted in sold out ad programming in markets anchored in some of the most contentious races of the cycle, he said. In several states, high-profile elections are attracting millions of dollars in independent spending -- from the Senate primaries in North Carolina to those in Arkansas and Colorado. Nationwide, FEC files reviewed by the Center for Responsive Politics revealed independent spending -- largely due to the impact of ""Citizens United"" -- has reached $72 million for the 2014 primaries, thus far, compared to just $23 million during the 2010 primaries and just $1.16 million in 2006 -- the last two midterm cycles. Tipping the scale . The Mississippi race attracted more than $11 million of this year's primary figure -- including advertising, direct mail and other expenses from outside groups -- topping the list of primaries most impacted by super PAC, PAC and nonprofit spending. And while Cochran outraised McDaniel's campaign 3-1, independent spending from outside groups has helped McDaniel slightly edge out Cochran in the money game. The Club for Growth Action super PAC spent more than $3 million alone in its bid to send McDaniel, currently a state senator, to Congress. That nearly matched the sum of independent spending from groups supporting Cochran. And while Mississippians may be fed up with the crush of political ads, a top political analyst in the state said the ads have definitely had a substantial impact on the race. ""We'd all like to say we don't like negative campaigning. And in fact, we don't like it, but it continues to be an unfortunate and objective fact that it affects people's voting patterns,"" author and political commentator Andy Taggart said, adding that the ads have made the election the subject of almost every conversation. Nasty Senate race digs deeper in the mud . But the onslaught of negative ads released by outside groups may also produce a backlash for the McDaniel and Cochran campaigns, as voters may associate the spots with the candidate they are supporting, Taggart said. In the two weeks leading up to the runoff, several groups purchased additional air time backing -- or bashing -- either candidate. Cochran's groups beefed up their efforts in the final push, with the National Association of Realtors and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce pushing out nearly $1 million in combined ad spending in the last leg of the race. McDaniel's supporters didn't back down either. The Club for Growth Action announced a $600,000 ad campaign to push their candidate over the electoral threshold and Citizens United and Senate Conservatives Action also jumped into the last-ditch media blitz with more than $300,000, according to FEC filings.

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- He might have some 60 albums under his belt and numerous awards to his name but iconic Zimbabwean musician Oliver Mtukudzi has no plans to slow down. ""Retiring from what?"" he asks purposefully when asked if he'd consider a break from music. ""This is me,"" explains 60-year-old Mtukudzi moments before he hits the stage at the Market Theater in downtown Johannesburg, South Africa. ""I'm doing me; I'm not doing a career. This is who I am; I can't retire really from myself."" It is, then, no surprise that award-winning Mtukudzi, who is affectionately called Tuku by his fans, decided to mark his birthday last September with the release of yet another album. Called ""Sarawoga,"" which means ""left alone"" in Shona, Mtukudzi's latest album is a tribute to his beloved son Sam, who died in a car crash in 2010 aged 21. Watch Mtukudzi performing . The recording comes after a long period of grief for the soft-spoken artist. ""I'm still learning to live with it,"" says Ntukudzi, who had written and rehearsed many of the album's songs with his son; Sam was a highly talented multi-instrumentalist himself who pursued his own music career but would also often perform with his father. ""I've only released my first offering this year and for the past two years I didn't even think about my music really,"" says Ntukudzi. ""I was just thinking of him and trying to recover, even though music was my therapy. I think I've performed more shows since 2010 up to today than ever before because that's the only therapy I've got."" Read related: Afrobeats going global . Born into a musical family in 1952, Mtukudzi has been successfully performing for nearly four decades throughout Africa as well as in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. His foot-stomping music has been described as a mixture of Zimbabwean pop style ""jit"" and South African township pop. Through his distinct sound and inspiring lyrics, he's documented the joy and pain of his countrymen who fought for freedom under colonial rule and died for democracy after Zimbabwe's independence in 1980. ""Where I come from you don't get to sing a song if you have nothing to say,"" says the musician, who grew up in Highfield, a ghetto neighborhood in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare. ""So every song has something to do with that man in the street, he must be able to use it in his life."" As a young boy, Mtukudzi joined choirs to improve his singing talent and taught himself how to play a three-string guitar. He soon started writing and recording songs and after an illustrious career he is today one of Zimbabwe's best-known musicians. Read related: The man who brought MTV to Africa . More than just an entertainer, Mtukudzi is committed to addressing everyday social challenges, using his music as a vehicle to speak about the issues he's passionate about. In 2003 he founded an art center in Norton, near Harare, and last year he became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for eastern and southern Africa, focusing on youth development and HIV/AIDS. Mtukudzi, who lost his brother Robert and several band members to AIDS, recently took his campaign to eradicate the HIV/AIDS stigma to mothers in Tanzania. He is also outspoken against patriarchy and has criticized polygamy as a practice that increases the risk of spreading HIV. But as well as tackling heated and important issues with his songs, the artist-turned-activist has also been producing and starring in feature films since the early 1990s, using his celebrity to empower and influence others. Released in the early 1990s, feature film ""Neria"" questions the place of tradition in the life of contemporary African women. The theme song remains to this day one of Mtukudzi's most popular tracks. ""I know sound is OK but visual can be better ... because it sticks in your head,"" he says. ""If you see things you get to understand things much better than when you just hear things. That's why we do short films and try and show them to the people."" Read related: Malian kora legend breaks music barriers . Back at the Market Theater, a few minutes before his sold-out concert begins, Mtukudzi admits that he still doesn't known which songs from his long repertoire he will play to his audience. His show, he says, is all about the moment. ""I don't write a setlist,"" he explains. ""How do I know the show is going to be for me to plan? I just look for the first song -- if I find the first song everything falls into place, because I don't know the mood of the day, so as I get into the mood I get the songs.""

"(CNN) -- I never actually caught a glimpse of the Tooth Fairy when I was young, but she was definitely real and in cahoots with my mom. This, due to the fact that I never woke up to find a Nintendo. It seems, however, that the Tooth Fairy had plenty of small bills. Which, to be fair, seems the appropriate amount of prize money for literally doing nothing, save for having things fall from your head. And at least she was reliable. Teeth came out. Money came in. Since then, I've only allowed my adult self to believe in the mythical Receding Hairline Fairy, who comes in during the night and inspects your shower drain for treasure. So far, however, despite plenty of offerings, she's failed to leave any cash under my pillow. Not even a Nintendo. Even so, I still believe. But now there's another fairy out there who is both very real and very reliable, and, for many adults, very welcome. She's the Weed Fairy. Basically, her job is to swoop into town and deliver free marijuana to people on the street. And she recently shared her generosity with Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. It was there over Memorial Day weekend that she posted around 50 fliers on street poles that read: ""These are tough times. Take this WEED and keep your spirits high."" Taped to each flier was a tiny little nugget of weed. The postings were signed with the Twitter handle @danksyappleweed, which, for those of you paying attention, is a clever play on the name Johnny Appleseed. Though, their missions in life appear to be rather different. Johnny Appleseed is a beloved American treasure who, at the turn of the 18th century, introduced apple trees to many parts of the United States. Danksy Appleweed, on the other hand, helps inspire overstressed businessmen to go home, eat a bag of Cheetos and watch Pink Floyd's Live at Pompeii. Which is equally as important. Danksy's real name is Yeni Sleidi, and, according to her website, she is a 23-year-old resident of Brooklyn's Park Slope neighborhood. But she decided to spread her love on a recent visit to Washington state, where marijuana is legal. Sleidi told Q13 Fox that, ""It's definitely easy to get it here in Seattle, but not everyone has the money."" And she's done it in the past. Several months ago she said she provided free weed to people in New York, where the feedback was positive. Which is why, now, she's much more open about who she is and what she does. The @danksyappleweed handle even links to her personal Twitter account, @sleidi_yeni. Of course, some people are concerned that the weed might fall into the wrong hands, like people under the age of 21. Or, say, your parents, who like to try things now that they're older. ""Diane, I found this on the street today. I believe it's legal marijuana."" ""Oh! How does it work?"" ""Maybe it's a suppository. Get me some olive oil."" But Sleidi says that she's careful about where her little wings take her, explaining, ""I try to leave it in areas where I know the majority of the people are of age."" And the police don't seem overly concerned either, telling Q13 Fox that it's not a top priority. Sadly, though, for people in Seattle hoping to find some free heady nuggets, Danksy tweeted on Friday that her short visit to the Emerald City had come to an end, posting her message with a photo taken at what appears to be 420 E. Pike Street. 420, of course, is a term the kids associate with marijuana, and a bit of modern slang that your parents will promptly mangle. ""OK, Diane, it's time. Let's 420 each other."" ""Yay! Here's the olive oil."" Follow @JarrettBellini on Twitter. See more content with questionable news value at CNN Comedy.","A woman calls herself the Weed Fairy, and leaves free pot on street posts .

"Copiaco, Chile (CNN) -- The wife of one of the 33 men trapped 2,300 feet below ground in Chile gave birth Tuesday to a daughter, a relative said. Elizabeth Segovia, wife of Ariel Ticona, was recovering in a hospital after giving birth to a 4-kilogram (8.8 lbs.), 48-centimeter (19-inch) girl, said Ticona's sister, Veronica Ticona. The daughter was to have been named Carolina, but that plan was changed after the August 5 cave-in trapped her father, Veronica Ticona said. Nearly two weeks ago, Segovia got a handwritten letter from her husband -- sent through the 4-inch-wide hole that has served as an umbilical cord to the miners -- proposing they name their daughter Esperanza Elizabeth instead. Esperanza is Spanish for hope. ""First, because we never lost hope; second, because it's the name of the camp where the families are living; and third, because the 33 miners never lost hope either,"" Segovia said earlier in September. Esperanza is believed to be the first child born to any of the 33 men since they were trapped. Read the latest on the rescue efforts . In the 40 days that have followed, their contact with the outside world has been limited to what rescuers have been able to pass through the narrow hole that reaches into the cave ceiling. Ticona said her brother was told of the birth by a video conference system. ""He is very happy to be a father,"" she said. Segovia discovered that their child would be a girl by looking at a grainy ultrasound on August 4, the day before the mine collapse. ""My world just collapsed,"" she said earlier this month. ""I couldn't react. I just cried and cried."" But, she added, she forced herself to stop crying because doing so adversely affected her fetus. The tube to the mine has carried life-affirming news in both directions. A few days after seeing her daughter on grainy, flickering ultrasound images, Segovia saw her husband on grainy video that the miners shot by the flickering lights mounted on their mining helmets, then packed into the tube for the journey upward. With her daughter's arrival Tuesday, Segovia is now waiting for her husband's arrival in the months ahead. The couple also have two sons, ages 5 and 9. CNN's Karl Penhaul contributed to this story.","Daughter was to have been named Carolina, but plan changed after cave-in .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The Michael Jackson song ""This Is It,"" released Monday, was co-written and recorded in 1983 with singer-songwriter Paul Anka, Anka and the Jackson estate confirmed Monday afternoon. Jackson's estate and Sony Music Entertainment did not realize this history when they picked the song out of boxes of tapes in their archives, leading to a big surprise Monday when Anka called them, Anka said. Jackson, who became busy with the success of his ""Thriller"" album, never finished the duet recording that was intended for Anka's ""Walk a Fine Line"" album, Anka said. Latin hip-hop singer Safire recorded and released the song in 1990 -- under the title ""I Never Heard,"" Anka said. ""Somebody just innocently found this tape and did not know somebody recorded it with him,"" Anka said. Estate spokesman James Bates acknowledged to CNN that the ""song was written with the legendary Paul Anka."" ""We picked the song because the lyrics were appropriate given the name Michael gave his tour,"" Bates said. It was just a coincidence that the song's first words were the same as Jackson's last planned tour, Anka said. Monday's release of the lilting love song was part of the promotion for the Sony movie ""Michael Jackson's This Is It,"" which comes out in two weeks. Anka said it was ""an honest mistake"" that the estate's special administrators quickly resolved Monday. ""They realized the mistake,"" Anka said ""They apologized and they've given me rightfully what I own. It's 50-50, right down the middle."" Rob Stringer, chairman of Sony's Columbia/Epic Label Group, was quoted in The New York Times on Sunday as saying he did not know the origins of the song. Anka, who is heard playing piano on the song, said producers did a beautiful job of completing it. Backing vocals from Jackson's brothers and orchestration were added to the spare voice and piano track recorded 26 years ago in Anka's studio. The original version, with just Jackson and Anka, will be included in the two-disc soundtrack, along with the orchestral version, Sony said. The orchestral version will play at the close of the film, which will feature Jackson's career highlights and last rehearsals, Sony said. The CD will be released on October 27, coincidental with the debut of the movie, Sony said. ""Disc one features the original album masters of some of Michael's biggest hits such as 'Billie Jean,' 'Smooth Criminal,' 'Human Nature,' and 'Thriller' arranged in the same sequence as they appear in the film,"" Sony said. The second disc includes ""early demo versions"" of Jackson classics ""She's Out Of My Life,"" ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"" and ""Beat It,"" Sony said. ""This disc also features a recently discovered spoken word poem from Michael Jackson entitled 'Planet Earth,"" the company said. The just-released song got widespread airplay on radio shows across the United States Monday, according to Nielsen BDS, a company that tracks music airplay. It the 21st most-played song on the 1,300 stations monitored by Nielsen, with at least 680 ""spins"" by mid-afternoon, the company said.","Paul Anka: Estate made ""honest mistake,"" will split sales .

"Abuja, Nigeria (CNN) -- Boko Haram's elusive leader claimed responsibility for a bombing in Nigeria's capital of Abuja that left dozens dead, but said nothing about the group's reported mass abduction of schoolgirls that occurred the same day as the explosion. A man claiming to be Abubakar Shekau made the comments in a video posted online on Saturday, saying the group attacked a bus station in retaliation for the what he described as the government's collusion with the United States in the killing of Muslims. ""This is a prelude,"" said the man, who wore camouflage and held an AK-47 assault rifle, in the video. In a warning to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, the man said: ""Let me be blunt: I am in your city, near you. Find me."" Mass abduction . The video surfaced the same day that an education official said a Nigerian schoolgirl, who was among the 129 kidnapped Monday by suspected Boko Haram militants, had returned home. Even so, 84 of the girl's classmates remain unaccounted for. A total of 45 girls are now free, according to a statement from Borno State Education Commissioner Musa Inuwa Kulo. This still unsettled situation began Monday night, when militants engaged in a battle with guards at the Government Girls Secondary School in the northeastern Nigerian town of Chibok began herding the girls onto buses and trucks and drove off, authorities said. But some of the schoolgirls managed subsequently to escape, including 14 on Friday and others on previous days, according to Kulo. This is a far cry from the Defense Ministry's previous report that all but eight of the girls had found freedom, a claim that Nigeria's military retracted Thursday. This retraction spurred fervent criticism of the government, with Lawan Zanna -- the father of one of the students -- blasting it as having resorted to ""blatant propaganda"" by making a ""blatant lie."" What is Boko Haram? While the mass abduction is extraordinary, violence in the region has been on the rise. That violence was on display Monday when a bomb exploded at the bus station in Abuja during rush hour, killing at least 75 people and wounding more than 100. But nowhere has it been more prevalent that in northeastern Nigeria's Borno, Yobe and Adamawa provinces, which have been under a state of emergency since mid-May due to persistent bloodshed there the government blames on Boko Haram. The Islamist militant group -- who name means ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language -- has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike. Boko Haram says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Africa's most populous nation, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. The advocacy group Human Rights Watch claims more than 3,000 people have been killed in Boko Haram-related violence in the past five years. Who is Shekau? Under Shekau, who took control of the group in 2009, violence carried out by the group has flourished, according to authorities. Questions have swirled about Shekau, including whether he's dead or alive. In recent years, the Nigerian military has touted his death, only to retract its claim after he appeared alive and vibrant in propaganda videos. He uses the alias Darul Tawheed, and analysts describe him as a ruthless loner and master of disguise. The United States has put a $7 million bounty on Shekau's head. It also designated Boko Haram as a foreign terrorist network last year. The group is diffuse, and Skekau does not speak directly with members, opting to communicate through a few select confidants. This may be why Shekau made no mention of the kidnapping of the schoolgirls. CNN's Faith Karimi and journalist Aminu Abubakar in Kano contributed to this report.","NEW: In a video, Boko Haram claims responsibility for a bombing at a bus station .

"London (CNN) -- ""It is a myth that rape is an inevitable part of conflict. There's nothing inevitable about it. It is a weapon of war aimed at civilians. It has nothing to do with sex, everything to do with power."" So said Hollywood star Angelina Jolie on Tuesday in London, as she opened the biggest summit of its kind aimed at ending the scourge of sexual violence in conflict. The four-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, hosted by the UK government, will bring together representatives of more than 100 countries, as well as hundreds more experts, survivors, faith leaders, and staffers from NGOs and international organizations. According to the U.N. children's agency, UNICEF, more than 150 million young girls and 73 million boys experience sexual violence every year, and children in conflict-affected countries are the most vulnerable. Yet shockingly few perpetrators are ever prosecuted or convicted. Jolie called for the international community to put priority on efforts to hold those responsible for sexual violence to account. And she said it was time to end a culture of silence and denial that helps war zone rape to thrive, and means that the rapists rarely face justice. ""They feel above the law because the law rarely touches them and society tolerates them,"" she said. ""We must send a message around the world that there is no disgrace in being a survivor of sexual violence -- that the shame is on the aggressor."" 'Shatter impunity' The summit organizers have four main aims: ending the culture of impunity by agreeing on an international protocol for documenting and investigating sexual violence in conflict zones; taking practical steps to protect women, including by training soldiers and peacekeepers; increasing support for survivors and human rights activists; and achieving a ""seismic shift"" in attitudes so that the problem is recognized and tackled globally. ""We need to shatter that impunity and make justice the norm, not the exception, for these crimes,"" Jolie said. ""I have met survivors from Afghanistan to Somalia and they are just like us, with one crucial difference: We live in safe countries, with doctors we can go to when we're hurt, police we can turn to when we're wronged and institutions that protect us."" It is up to everyone to help make this summit a turning point, Jolie said, and to work across borders, governments and religious faiths to bring an end to the use of rape and sexual violence in war. ""We really can do it,"" she said. Speaking alongside Jolie, with whom he launched the campaign to end sexual violence in conflict two years ago, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague pledged another Â£6 million ($10 million) from the UK government to help support survivors. ""We want people around the world to understand the scale of the problem and the urgent need for action, to recognize the damage it does to international peace and security and to be mobilized and inspired to work within their societies and with us to bear down on this terrible injustice,"" he said. Time to act . UNICEF called on those at the summit, which runs until Friday, to agree on ""concrete measures"" to protect children in conflict from rape and abuse. Its own figures give an idea of the scale of the problem. According to UNICEF, about 40% of Congolese women are believed to have been subjected to some form of sexual violence at some point in their lives, while in the most recent conflict in South Sudan, rape has been used by both sides of the conflict during fighting. During the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 women survived rape, UNICEF says, while an estimated 20,000 to 50,000 women were raped during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the early 1990s. In an online post, the agency recounts the ""sadly typical"" story of a woman in Goma in the Democratic Republic of the Congo whose daughter, born from rape, was called a witch and herself raped, at age 6, by her 14-year-old cousin. Amnesty International also said it was ""time to deliver"" on the ambitious goal of ending violence against women in conflict -- and the broader but related problem of gender inequality. Pope Francis, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, added his voice to those calling for change. ""Let us pray for all victims of sexual violence in conflict, and those working to end this crime,"" he tweeted Tuesday, using the hashtag #TimeToAct. Violence against women: By the numbers .

"(CNN) -- Latinos, immigrants and Native Americans experience ""a pattern of human right violations"" in the American Southwest under U.S. immigration policies, Amnesty International said in a new report. A two-year study focusing mostly on Arizona and Texas found that ""communities living along the border -- particularly Latinos and individuals perceived to be of Latino origin, and indigenous communities -- are disproportionately affected by a range of immigration control measures, resulting in a pattern of human rights violations,"" Amnesty International said. The report cited the failure of federal and state laws to respect immigrants' right to life and found that U.S. citizens of Latino descent and Native Americans are subjected to ""discriminatory profiling by federal, state and local law enforcement officials, that result in their being disproportionately targeted for police stops and searches."" Other breaches of international human rights standards occurred in the access to justice for immigrant survivors of crime and in accountability for state officials and private individuals accused of abusing immigrants' rights, the group said. ""All immigrants, irrespective of their legal status, have human rights. Amnesty International's report shows that the USA is failing in its obligations under international law to ensure these rights,"" the report said. The group's report, which urged a suspension and a federal review of all immigration enforcement programs, was criticized and dismissed by U.S. officials. ""Amnesty International's report is based almost entirely on either outdated information or anonymous anecdotes that can be neither investigated nor resolved,"" Department of Homeland Security spokesman Matt Chandler said. ""Moreover, the report does not offer thoughtful, actionable recommendations for improvement but instead calls for the wholesale suspension of immigration enforcement programs nationwide,"" Chandler said. Federal and state authorities disputed the report's accusations of racial profiling and other findings. ""The Amnesty International Report makes a rather general statement of criticism toward all law enforcement in Southern Arizona,"" said Bart Graves, spokesman for the Arizona Department of Public Safety. ""The Arizona Department of Public Safety does not take part in racial profiling."" Texas state police refer cases to the Border Patrol or Immigration and Customs Enforcement when there is a ""reasonable suspicion that a person is in violation of a federal immigration law,"" said Tom Vinger, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety. ""The state of Texas does not have immigration laws. However, DPS officers do arrest criminal aliens, regardless of country of origin, when they violate state laws,"" Vinger said in a statement. The federal Secure Communities initiative was designed to prevent racial profiling by having the fingerprints of every person arrested and taken into custody checked against FBI criminal records and federal immigration records, Chandler said. That initiative reduces ""the risk of discrimination or racial profiling because the program applies to all who are arrested and booked for a crime, including U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents,"" Chandler said. The Amnesty International report said monitoring and accountability of immigration and law officers who practice discriminatory profiling is ""lacking,"" and those officials are ""rarely held to account, with the result that such practices have become both commonplace and entrenched,"" the report said. FBI statistics show that bias crimes against Latinos have increased 40% from 2003 to 2007, and about 56% of bias victims don't file police reports because they often believe police won't help them, Amnesty International said. ""The fact that local law enforcement officials are used to implement federal immigration programs has exacerbated this problem. Those who do decide to report crimes may still be denied access to justice because law enforcement officials see them not as the victims of crime, but as criminals,"" the report said. ""Immigrant victims of crimes such as human trafficking and domestic violence also face obstacles when attempting to access justice and remedies, while the proliferation of recently enacted state laws in Arizona and other states across the country obstructs immigrants' ability to access education and essential health care services,"" the report added. But the federal government said that under a new Immigration and Customs Enforcement policy, officers exercise ""appropriate discretion to ensure victims and witnesses to crimes are not penalized by removal,"" Chandler said. The federal agency also developed a policy to protect victims of domestic violence and other offenses and to ensure the crimes are prosecuted, Chandler said. The rights group criticized U.S. border policy for pushing undocumented immigrants to use deadly desert routes as a way to enter the country. Amnesty International reported as many as 5,287 migration deaths along the border from 1998 to 2008. ""Increasingly, state laws and local policies are creating barriers to or discouraging immigrants from accessing their rights to education and essential health care services, impacting their U.S. citizen children,"" the report said. At the same time, the U.S. government has reported that 14,500 to 17,000 people are trafficked into the country for sexual or labor exploitation, and while the federal government offers so-called T-visas for such trafficking survivors, only 6% of such visas were actually utilized in 2009, Amnesty International said. The report also recommended that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection should consult with the 26 Indian nations along the border and respect and facilitate the use of tribal passports, identification papers and immigration documents for travel across the international lines. For example, the Tohono O'odham nation straddles both countries, including 76 miles of the international line, with 28,000 members in Arizona, the report said. The tribe uses identity cards listing one of five districts to which a U.S.-born member belongs, while the cards for members born on the Mexico side list ""ND"" for ""No District,"" the report said. Customs and Border Protection said it is working with tribes to develop forms of identification, and as of January, the federal government has approved six of 12 tribes' memoranda of understanding to develop tribal identification that is valid for crossing the border, Chandler said. Of the six, two tribes, the Kootenai of Idaho and the Pascua Yaqui of Arizona, have fully approved Enhanced Tribal Cards that are accepted as documents to enter the United States, Chandler said.","Amnesty International studies human rights violations on the U.S.-Mexico border .

"(CNN) -- Once again, Obamacare has made its way back before the Supreme Court. The high court decided Tuesday to review two challenges by for-profit corporations and their religious owners over comprehensive contraception coverage required by the Affordable Care Act. And if the justices follow more than 200 years of constitutional law and history on what it means to enjoy the free exercise of religion in America, the court should yet again hand a victory to the act. It had little choice but to agree to hear the cases this term. Using unprecedented legal reasoning, three federal circuit courts of appeals have ruled that secular, for-profit business corporations and/or the individuals who own them have a valid claim that the mandate to provide no-cost, FDA-approved contraception in their employer-sponsored health plan violates their asserted right to the free exercise of religion. Two other federal circuit courts of appeals have rejected these claims; the Supreme Court frequently steps in to resolve such disagreements among the federal courts of appeals. Unless the Supreme Court reverses these radical decisions, the consequences could reach far beyond the Affordable Care Act, making this particular roadblock for Obamacare more problematic in the long term than the well-publicized problems associated with the health exchange website's rollout. By accepting the religious free-exercise claims, these three federal courts have turned first principles of religious freedom, as well as fundamental tenets of corporate law, on their head. From the nation's founding until today, the Constitution's protection of religious liberty has been seen as a personal right, inextricably linked to the human capacity to express devotion to a God and act on the basis of reason and conscience. Business corporations, quite properly, have never shared in this fundamental constitutional tradition for the obvious reason that a business corporation lacks the basic human capacities -- reason, dignity and conscience -- at the core of the right to free exercise of religion. Obviously not ""persons"" in the usual sense of the word, these corporations are also not religious organizations, which have historically received some constitutional protection and are, in fact, given exemptions from the contraception mandate. These businesses do not hire employees on the basis of their religion and their employees are not required to share the religious beliefs personally held by the corporation's owners. In all of American history, secular, for-profit corporations have never been understood to ""exercise"" religion -- have you ever seen Exxon Mobil in the pew next to you at church? -- and have never been protected by the right to free exercise. To be sure, the devout individual business owners behind the corporations in these challenges have their own personal rights to exercise their religion, but those rights have nothing to do with Obamacare's contraception coverage requirement. Why? Because federal law does not require the individuals who own the company to personally provide health care coverage or to satisfy any other legal obligation of the corporation. The law places requirements only on the corporate entity. To conflate the corporations in these cases with their owners violates basic principles of corporate law. When business owners create a corporation as the means of carrying out their business, they create a distinct legal entity with rights, obligations, privileges and liabilities that are different from the individuals who set up the corporation. This generally works to the benefit of the individual owners, which is why people choose to incorporate in the first place. And it means that certain rights specific to individuals do not carry over to the corporate form. For example, the Supreme Court has held that an individual acting in his personal capacity has the right to ""plead the Fifth"" and refuse to turn over documents that could incriminate him, but that same individual acting in his official capacity as a corporate owner has no such right against self-incrimination. Like the right to the free exercise of religion, the right against self-incrimination has always been understood to be a personal right of freedom and conscience that artificial corporate entities simply do not share. A business owner simply does not have the right to move back and forth freely between individual and corporate status to obtain all the advantages and avoid any of the disadvantages of the respective forms. Whether you have cheered the misfortunes Obamacare has suffered over the past month or bemoaned them, the distortion of basic principles of corporate law and free exercise jurisprudence by the three federal courts that have endorsed the corporate challenges to the ACA's contraception mandate should be troubling. The Supreme Court, as always, will have the final say. If the justices follow more than 200 years of constitutional law and history, not to mention basic principles of corporate law, the court should hand another victory to Obamacare. I'm sure the administration -- and more importantly, the women and their families who risk losing important health benefits to which they are legally entitled -- would welcome the win. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Elizabeth B. Wydra.","Elizabeth Wydra: Supreme Court to review contraception challenge to Obamacare .

"(CNN) -- Three bombings, including an attack on an elementary school, killed at least 19 people and wounded at least 167 in Iraq Sunday. A number of sectarian attacks killed dozens and wounded many more in the country Saturday. The United Nations' envoy called on the ""political, religious and civil leaders"" to take action to stop the ""accelerated surge in violence and bloodshed."" Two suicide truck bombers exploded almost simultaneously at a police station and a school in al-Qubba -- a predominantly Shiite Turkmen area in the northern outskirts of Mosul -- Sunday morning, Mosul police officials told CNN. The first explosion killed 12 people -- most of them police officers -- at the police station, officials said. A second blast followed seconds later near an elementary school, wounding 137 people -- mostly children, the officials said. In a third attack, a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest targeted Shiite pilgrims in northeast Baghdad's al-Qahira neighborhood. The explosion killed at least seven people and wounded 30 others, Baghdad police told CNN. On Saturday, 51 people were killed and 107 others were wounded in a suicide attack that targeted Shiite pilgrims in northeastern Baghdad, police said. The bomber, wearing an explosive vest, detonated among Shiite pilgrims near the al-Amma bridge in the Sunni al-Adhamiya neighborhood. The victims were among thousands of Shiite pilgrims heading to the al-Kadhimiya neighborhood of northwestern Baghdad to commemorate the death of Mohammed al-Jawad, the ninth of the 12 imams in Shiism. In a separate incident in the town of Balad in the north, at least 12 people were killed and 32 others were wounded when a car bomb exploded Saturday evening outside a coffee shop, police said. The town, which is predominantly Shiite, is located in Salaheddin province some 90 kilometers (56 miles) north of Baghdad and has been the site of previous violence. In the al-Baya neighborhood of southwestern Baghdad, a makeshift bomb exploded Saturday evening inside a coffee shop, killing two people and wounding 10 others, Baghdad police told CNN. The area is largely Shia. On Saturday morning, gunmen fatally shot a television reporter and a cameraman who were working for al-Sharqiya, a private, pro-Sunni television station that is often critical of the Shiite-led government. The incident occurred in central Mosul in northern Iraq, police said. Also Saturday, at least two Iraqi security forces were killed and three others were wounded when gunmen attacked a security checkpoint south of Falluja, a predominantly Sunni city about 60 kilometers (38 miles) west of Baghdad in Anbar province, police in Ramadi told CNN. ""In the aftermath of yet another series of bloody attacks that indiscriminately hit pilgrims, school children, journalists, as well as ordinary citizens trying to go about their daily lives, the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for Iraq, Mr. Nickolay Mladenov called on political, religious and civil leaders to work together with the security forces and take joint action to halt the accelerated surge in violence and bloodshed,"" the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq said in a statement Sunday. ""It is their responsibility to ensure that pilgrims can practice their religious duties, that school children can attend their classes, that journalists can exercise their professional duties, and that ordinary citizens can live a normal life, in an environment free of fear and violence,"" Mladenov said.","U.N. envoy calls for action to stop the ""accelerated surge in violence and bloodshed""

"Los Angeles, CNN  -- As one of the most successful franchises in Major League  Baseball history, the Los Angeles Dodgers opened the 2011 season with a victory over the World Champion San Francisco Giants. The nationally televised game was nearly sold out with a seating capacity of 56,000 fans. The franchise with six World Series championships was considered a strong contender for a pennant with new manager Don Mattingly, who succeeded Joe Torre. Since owner Frank McCourt acquired the team in 2004, the Dodgers have reached the post-season four times, following a decade-long drought. But a vicious post-game attack on Giants fan Bryan Stow and McCourt's bitter divorce proceeding have changed the landscape at one of baseball's most picturesque parks. Equally disturbing is how fan attendance has declined dramatically, with many sections of the stadium now empty on game days. The renowned team that nurtured icons such as Sandy Koufax, Jackie Robinson, Tommy Lasorda and Fernando Valenzuela is unmistakably troubled, said Nelson Gayton, executive director of the Anderson Center for Managing Enterprises in Media, Entertainment and Sports at the University of California at Los Angeles. ""Here you have a team that is not only America's darling but truly one of the crown jewels of Major League Baseball,"" Gayton said. ""In many ways, what has happened is that the brand luster has been tarnished. I would say this has been happening precipitously over the last few years. And not winning couldn't have helped. What you have is a turnaround that is much needed,"" Gayton added. ""It's a sad state of affairs."" But all's not lost, Gayton said. ""If you're going to ask me whether the value of the brand is diminished significantly, I wouldn't say that,"" Gayton stated. That brand is partly founded in how the then-Brooklyn Dodgers broke baseball's color line in the 1940s with the signing of Robinson, a former UCLA star who eventually became the first African-American elected to the Hall of Fame. The team debuted in Brooklyn in 1890 as the ""Bridgegrooms"" and won the National League championship -- the first of 21 pennants that the club would win during the following 100 years. ""Trolley Dodgers"" was later attached to the team because of the maze of trolley cars in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, and the nickname was shortened to its current form. In 1955, the Dodgers won their first World Series, during the Robinson era. Then in 1958, the team moved to Los Angeles, where it won the World Series again in 1959. In another landmark, mellifluous broadcaster Vin Scully this year entered an unprecedented 62nd season announcing Dodgers baseball. Still, the attack of Stow on March 31 -- the season's opener -- has cast a pall over the team: he was beaten nearly to death in the parking lot, supposedly by two Dodger fans, and he's still hospitalized. The Stow assault left an indelible sense of concern over safety, in spite of increased security, according to interviews with fans and season ticket holders. Police have yet to solve the case. In a recently filed lawsuit, Stow's family alleges that security officers and managers at Dodger Stadium have been apprised of a history of aggressive, violent behavior. The suit asserts the presence of criminal gang activity in some crowds at the stadium and inadequate safety -- both factors in the attack, according to the lawsuit. While overall league attendance is down this season, the Dodgers are taking an especially hard hit: there are 7,000 fewer fans attending home games -- amounting to an attendance loss of 200,000 so far this year, Dodgers officials say. In addition, McCourt's financial turmoil led Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig to take over day-to-day operations as the league conducts an investigation into his finances. McCourt declined to be interviewed. The nation's struggling economic recovery and the team's below-.500 winning percentage may have played a role in attendance declines. ""It's a number of factors,"" Josh Rawitch, Dodger's vice president of communications, said in explaining the loss of the faithful. Robert Watkin, who has been attending Dodger games for 31 years, says he feels disenchanted. ""Since the McCourts took over he's made it his priority to take care of personal business besides making this organization the successful organization it's always been,"" he said. Watkin said the feeling of a family atmosphere has dissipated, and he blames McCourt. ""People have lost trust. You used to come here, and it wouldn't matter if the team was winning. It was fun. It just doesn't feel that way anymore, and I think in essence people are boycotting until something turns around,"" he said. If a California judge overseeing the divorce of Frank and Jamie McCourt orders that the Dodgers be put up for sale, Los Angeles Councilwoman Janice Hahn is prepared: she has already introduced legislation calling on Major League Baseball to give fans an opportunity to buy the team. ""Watching the ongoing custody trial over the team has been painful for all Dodger fans. The truth is that this team belongs to the fans; and we should have a chance at purchasing the Dodgers if they are sold,"" said Hahn, who added that her late father, Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, was responsible for bringing the team to Los Angeles in the 1950s. Her proposal is a long shot. In 1961, Major League Baseball passed a resolution forbidding public ownership of teams. Congressional legislation is needed to remove the restriction and make it possible for fans to join together to purchase the team, said Hahn. Meanwhile, a consortium of investors led by Beverly Hills-based real estate developer Stanley Stalford has launched an effort to purchase the Dodgers similar to the way the NFL's Green Bay Packers became a publicly owned franchise. Andre Hannie is a season ticket holder who says he also feels betrayed by the lavish personal spending of McCourt. But he remains a die-hard fan. ""I am bitter over what he's done over the years, but it's not going to stop me from supporting the team. There could be 12 people here and I would still come out every night,"" Hannie said. Hannie, who attended opening day with his 15-year-old son, has some concerns about safety, especially how the Stow attack has damaged the image of fans. ""People have labeled us as like some fans being gang bangers that come here and get kind of rowdy, which I have seen, but this is a family game. I personally feel safe, but security does what it can to make sure it's safe,"" Hannie said. Hannie wants to see the team go from loser to winner. ""We need an owner here who's committed to the team, the fans and most importantly winning. It's been (almost) 25 years since we've won a World Series,"" said the Dodger fan.","Los Angeles Dodgers attendance is way down this year .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- A former Royal Caribbean Cruise Line employee has been arrested and charged with burglarizing the homes of 24 vacationers who were spending time at sea. Police in Palm Beach County say the employee accessed personal information about reservations to find out when the vacationers would be away. Bethsaida Sandoval, 38, a Royal Caribbean vacation planner, has been charged with 24 counts of burglary across Palm Beach County, including Boca Raton, Jupiter and Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Sandoval's husband, John Lopez, acted as her accomplice, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. According to the probable cause affidavit, Sandoval admitted that she and her husband were involved in the burglaries. Her position gave her full access to victims' home addresses. ""People were on vacation, and when they returned home, they found they were burglarized,"" said Teri Barbera, a spokeswoman for the sheriff's office. ""One common factor was that they were all on vacation with Royal Caribbean."" Sandoval allegedly told police that she printed or wrote down personal information on customers and gave the information to Lopez. The affidavit says Sandoval stated that she and her husband would then go to the houses and burgle them. Lopez is being held on an unrelated charge in nearby Broward County. He's expected to be charged soon in the string of burglaries, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. Investigators believe that the burglaries took place on the first night of the cruises, while the homeowners were at sea. The ships departed from the Port of Miami or Port Everglades, in Fort Lauderdale, according to the probable cause affidavit. The sheriff's office says Royal Caribbean has fully cooperated with the investigation. A cruise line spokeswoman, Cynthia Martinez, said Sandoval was fired for her actions. ""Royal Caribbean does not tolerate any form of criminal activity in its workforce or operations,"" it said in a statement. ""This is a situation involving a former employee who appears to have taken advantage of their position for personal gain. Royal Caribbean cooperated fully with authorities during this investigation and will continue providing any assistance necessary to prosecute this individual to the fullest extent of the law."" The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office says the investigation, which took place over several months, revealed that high-dollar amounts of property, money and firearms were stolen. According to the affidavit, Sandoval was seen entering the Royal Caribbean building after hours, about 1 a.m. The time was documented by her door access swipe card and her computer login as she accessed the Royal Caribbean system. ""This is not normal business practice and Bethsaida Sandoval should not be in the building, or accessing Royal Caribbean computer systems at that time of night,"" reads the affidavit. Authorities said Sandoval told them that she would drive and Lopez would get out of the car and use a center punch, a small tool for punching holes, to smash out the glass of a rear sliding-glass door. The affidavit says she gave the center punch to investigators. The cruise line said in its statement, ""We regret this incident occurred and hope it does not overshadow the excellent work our more than 40,000 Royal Caribbean employees do every day to provide our guests with memorable and outstanding cruise vacation experiences."" The cruise line says it is reaching out to apologize to all guests who were affected.","Former Royal Caribbean worker charged in 24 burglaries .

"(CNN) -- It's the question Edin Dzeko is constantly asked. ""You ask me again about war..."" sighs the 28-year-old, rolling his eyes and smiling as he enjoys a rare moment of peace outside Bosnia-Herzegovina's team hotel in the picturesque suburb of Ilidza. Perhaps the line of questioning is understandable given that just a short drive away is Dzeko's home city of Sarajevo, where the national hero lived throughout the Bosnian War which raged between 1992 and 1995. The war in Bosnia left tens of thousands dead, and hundreds of thousands displaced. But just as the bullet holes which still riddle this land represent a gruesome past, Dzeko and his teammates have become symbols of a different more optimistic future. For the first time in its short history, Bosnia is off to the World Cup. ""I never thought I would be where I am now,"" Dzeko, who played a key role in Manchester City's 2013-14 English Premier League title triumph, told CNN. Dzeko's early years were played out against the devastating backdrop of the consequences of a brutal internecine conflict. ""I started to play football when I was about 10, my father brought me to one school because there were more pitches where we could play. Everything was destroyed after the war."" In previous interviews Dzeko has spoken of how his family home was destroyed and he was forced to live in his grandparents' house with 15 of his relatives. His mother once inadvertently saved his life, calling him inside seconds before the land he was playing on was hit by bombs. The siege of Sarajevo followed the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, with conflict erupting between the ethnic groups which make up Bosnia -- chiefly Bosnian Muslims, Croats and Serbs. Modern-day Bosnia is an independent state, although still under international administration. ""I was here all the time during the war and I know what it is, but I think we came out stronger,"" explains Dzeko. ""We want to show the world that even if you go through some bad periods, you always have to think positive just to go forward. ""Some people had a very hard life, we are still making positives and I think that's amazing."" Amid the bombs and bullets, Dzeko forged an unlikely path to the top. After signing his first professional contract in Bosnia, the young striker earned a move to Teplice in the Czech Republic before getting his big break with VFL Wolfsburg in the German Bundesliga. He became one of the hottest properties in European football during a prolific spell which saw him score 67 Bundesliga goals in three-and-a-half seasons, with City winning the race for his signature after paying Wolfsburg a reported $45 million in January 2011. While Dzeko carries echoes of the fighting wherever he goes, other members of the Bosnia squad had a different experience. Asmir Begovic and his family left Trebinje, 80 miles south of Sarajevo, and headed to Germany before immigrating to Canada. Aged four when his family relocated, Begovic has no memories of the conflict which engulfed his homeland. ""And it's probably better so,"" the 26-year-old goalkeeper, who plays in England for Stoke City. ""I mean it's obviously very bad memories, very bad experiences for some of my other family members who have been around and stayed for the war. ""I left when I was a boy, so I really don't remember much from the past. ""As I've gotten older I've educated myself a little on the situation and what happened, drawn on experiences from my family members and friends, who lived through it and it was just a very unpleasant experience as people can imagine. ""For our quality of life as a family, just being able to be safe in a different country meant a lot to us."" Although Begovic's life abroad has left its mark on his voice -- he speaks perfect English with a slight North American accent -- he insists his upbringing was distinctly Bosnian. ""I've always been very close to the country,"" he says. ""When the opportunity came it was a fantastic thing for myself and my family to do, I couldn't wait to put on a Bosnia shirt and I haven't really looked back since."" Neither has Bosnia's national football team. Since an inauspicious first official international match in November 1995 -- a 2-0 reverse away to Albania -- ""The Dragons"" have gone from strength to strength. Bids to qualify for the 2010 World Cup and the 2012 European Championships fell agonizingly short, with Portugal ending the team's hopes at the playoff stage of both qualification competitions. But, on October 15, 2013 in the Lithuanian capital city of Vilnius, a goal from striker Vedad Ibisevic sealed a 1-0 win for Safet Susic's Bosnia and passage to Brazil 2014. Cue wild celebrations on the streets of Sarajevo, with the team flying home to be greeted by 50,000 ecstatic Bosnian football fans. ""I am proud of this team that we achieved some great things, that we did some things that nobody could do it before us,"" said Dzeko. ""When you see 50,000 there waiting for you, then you know you did something good."" ""We've learned from our past, we've learned from our failures and I think we've definitely grown as a team and we've been able to overcome that final hurdle now,"" added Begovic. ""To receive such an ovation and such a reception from our people, being able to celebrate with them is what qualifying and being able to qualify for major tournaments is all about. ""It's something we have all accomplished together."" Now Rio de Janeiro's iconic Maracana Stadium awaits. At the arena first built for the 1950 World Cup and lavishly redeveloped for Brazil's second hosting of the tournament, Bosnia will take its bow against a Lionel Messi-led Argentina. African Cup of Nations winners Nigeria and Iran are the other two teams which make up a tough Group F. ""I'm very much looking forward to it,"" says Begovic, who will be trying to keep out four-time FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Messi. ""That's what football is all about, being able to work your whole life to get to a World Cup and then playing against one of the biggest football countries in the world in the opening game. ""Obviously we're massive underdogs, so we've got nothing to lose in that game, we can go there with an open mind and see how we can beat them. ""It's going to be a huge challenge, but I believe in the quality of our team and we can cause Argentina problems."" With players like Begovic and Dzeko, not to mention Roma playmaker Miralem Pjanic, Bosnia have players capable of upsetting the odds. And in Dzeko, they also have a leader who is determined to show how far his country has come in the last 20 years. ""I love this country, I love my country,"" he said. ""I am very happy that I am born here and I am very happy that I know that I will always, always come back here. ""I think we all just can't wait for this World Cup to start.""

"Northern Syria (CNN) -- Undeterred by a wave of casualties, Syrian rebels say they will not back down in their quest to seize Aleppo, the country's commercial hub and its second-largest city. After six days of fighting, the battle with government forces raged again Thursday as helicopter gunships flew over the city, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. At least one rebel fighter was killed, the group said. ""They don't seem to have the kind of weapons necessary,"" New Yorker reporter Jon Lee Anderson told CNNI's ""Amanpour"" from Aleppo about the rebels who, he said, believe the battle to be a decisive one. ""If Bashar al-Assad can't dislodge them from Aleppo, then it's over for him. So they have to fight to the death."" A rebel commander north of Aleppo told CNN he was sending 300 more fighters to bolster forces in Aleppo. The commander said the rebels were on the offensive in Aleppo, where 18 of 22 rebel brigades were located. In preparation for a fresh onslaught expected after Friday prayers, rebels were setting up medical clinics in apartments and homes throughout the city, he said. The seat of al-Assad's power also saw renewed violence Thursday as explosions rocked Damascus, another opposition group said. Read more: Does U.S. have plan for post-Assad Syria? Regime forces battled rebels in several Damascus neighborhoods, and the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk came under ""fierce helicopter shelling with machine guns,"" the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The LCC reported dozens of dead and wounded in shelling by regime forces in the capital city's suburb of Yalda, and in bomb attacks in the Mashtal district of Damascus. The death toll for Thursday across Syria reached 200, including a number of children, women and defectors, the LCC said. Forty-eight died in Aleppo, 46 in Damascus and its suburbs; 30 in Daraa; 27 in Idlib; 21 in Homs; 14 in Deir Ezzor; six in Hama; four in Raqqa, two in Latakia, one in Qunaitera and one in Hasaka, it said. The LCC said Thursday marks the first time since the start of the uprising in March 2011 that Aleppo has led in the number of deaths in a single day across Syria. Some of those killed in the Al-A'ajamy Valley were defected soldiers seeking ""to save civilians fleeing from shelling,"" the group said. Video posted on YouTube appears to show youths demonstrating in the central Damascus neighborhood of Qanawat. ""The people united, will never be divided,"" they chant in English. ""The Syrians united, will never be defeated."" And, ""Hey Bashar, damn your soul. Hey Bashar, damn your soul."" Rebel militias are composed largely of soldiers who have defected from the Syrian military. But there are also many civilians -- including students, shopkeepers, real-estate agents and even members of the president's ruling Ba'ath party -- all trying to end four decades of al-Assad family rule.

A Sunni cleric in the village of Injara, about six miles west of Aleppo, showed CNN craters and gaping holes in at least six homes, the result of what he and other residents said were rockets and artillery from a Syrian army base a couple of miles away. ""They hit us every night,"" Sheikh Ali Bukhro said. Other residents said they had had neither electricity nor running water in more than a month. Some men said they had sent their families to refugee camps in Turkey, where more than 40,000 Syrian refugees have taken shelter. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said U.S. officials had ""grave concerns"" about the situation in and around Aleppo and Damascus. ""This is the concern: That we will see a massacre in Aleppo -- and that's what the regime appears to be lining up for,"" she told reporters. Given that China and Russia have vetoed attempts by the Security Council to act, ""we have to double our efforts with like-minded nations outside of the U.N. system,"" she said. ""This is a horrific situation, this is abhorrent what this regime is willing to do against its own people. We have to call it out, we have to do what we can to strengthen the opposition for the day after. We have to do what we can in coordination with others in the international community."" The British ambassador to the United Nations said reports of warplanes over Aleppo were especially concerning. ""The reports now of attacks by regime fighter jets in Aleppo mark yet a further dangerous escalation and underlines that there are no boundaries that the Assad regime will not cross in the misguided hope that it can resist the will of its people and hang on to power,"" British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday. Thursday's front page of Syria's pro-regime newspaper al Watan carried the headline ""Aleppo ... the Mother of all Battles."" WMD threat 'demands a response' For his part, al-Assad sent a congratulatory message Tuesday to Kim Jong Un, the recently installed supreme leader of North Korea, the state-run KCNA news agency reported Thursday. ""I would like to express my deep thanks to Your Excellency, the leadership of the DPRK and the friendly Korean people for having rendered support and encouragement to our just cause against the moves of the world powers to interfere in our internal affairs,"" it said. Meanwhile, Herve Ladsous, the under-secretary-general for peacekeeping operations, told reporters Thursday in Damascus that half of the 300 U.N. observers sent to Syria in April have been sent home, but are prepared to return should circumstances change. ""And that is our sincere hope,"" Ladous told reporters. The decision was made after ""we found ourselves with too many people with not enough to do,"" he said. The monitors' mission was suspended in June, when officials deemed it too dangerous for them to continue their work. They remained in Syria prepared to resume their efforts to monitor compliance with a six-point peace plan brokered by U.N. and Arab League joint special envoy to Syria Kofi Annan once the conditions changed. Ladsous was not optimistic that would happen soon. ""Unfortunately, as of today, I cannot say that we see many indications that a decrease in violence will happen overnight. I say again, Syrians killing Syrians is something that should not continue."" As the violence spirals, many civilians have become internally displaced or fled over the border and fears of sectarian conflict have grown. Asked Thursday if Ankara was considering establishing safe zones in northern Syria to counter any threat to Turkey's security from the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was noncommittal but said officials were discussing their options. ""It is out of question that we would allow a terrorist organization to be based in northern Syria and become a threat to our country,"" he said in televised remarks. ""All of these are among alternatives -- safe zone, buffer zone or camps such as the ones we have now -- all of these are among alternatives,"" he said. ""Our Foreign Ministry, armed forces, intelligence organizations are working on this, and decisions or steps that will need to be taken will be taken when the time comes."" Turkey and the United States consider the PKK a terrorist group. Speaking Thursday at a memorial to those who died in the Srebrenica massacre in the Balkans in the 1990s, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged the Syrian government and the opposition forces to cooperate with the United Nations in ending the conflict. The U.N observer mission in Syria has been unable to do its job ""because of the noncompliance of the parties -- the government parties and also opposition forces,"" he said. The six-point peace plan must also be implemented ""without further delay,"" he said. Waving the 'red flag' on arming Syria's opposition . ""At this time again I am urging all the parties: They must stop fighting and killing people now. They have to begin political dialogue for a political resolution of this crisis,"" Ban said. After 16 months of chaos, more officials from al-Assad's regime have resigned. The opposition Syrian National Council said Wednesday that two senior Syrian diplomats were the latest to defect. One was the Syrian ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Abdullatif Al Dabbagh, SNC spokesman George Sabra said. The second is Al Dabbagh's wife, Lamia Al Harriri, who was a Syrian envoy to Cyprus. She defected to Qatar, SNC member Najy Tayyarah said. Al Harriri is also the niece of Syrian Vice President Farouq Al Sharea. But on Thursday, a Syrian official downplayed the reports of recent defections. Read more: A Syrian town's 'Street of Death' Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said Dabbagh ""was called to Damascus for consultations with the minister and has been off duty ... since June 4.""

"(CNN) -- I love Thanksgiving. I love everything about it: gathering three generations around the table, pausing for a moment with heads bowed to thank God for our abundant blessings, carrying a tradition across the centuries, watching my beloved Texas Longhorns play football. I even love clanging the pots and scraping the plates afterward. And I especially love the eating. We are traditionalists in my family, so it's turkey and stuffing, and three kinds of pie. I am hoping this year to add one more item to the menu: a small serving of conscience. For as we gorge ourselves, Congress is contemplating drastic cuts in food aid for the least of our brethren. Food stamps, formally known as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance for the Poor, or SNAP, help poor people eat -- simple as that. And I mean poor. The average SNAP household has a gross income of just $744 per month. I'll bet House Speaker John Boehner spends more than that each month just on cigs and merlot. Requirements to receive food stamps have become so tight that Feeding America, the nation's leading domestic hunger-relief charity, estimates that only 57% of food-insecure Americans are even eligible for food stamps. Can you imagine being too poor to afford food, but too ""rich"" to qualify for food stamps? Eatocracy Opinion: SNAP Isn't about a free lunch . So benefits under the SNAP program go to the poorest of the poor -- and they're not exactly living high on the hog off food stamps, either. The average monthly SNAP benefit per person is $133.85, or less than $1.50 per person, per meal. A buck-fifty per meal doesn't go far. By the third week of the month, most people's benefits have already run out. And yet even that miserly amount is too generous for some Republican politicians. Rep. Stephen Fincher, R-Tennessee, has likened food aid for the poor to robbery, telling a gathering of his fellow Tennesseans, ""The role of citizens, of Christians, of humanity is to take care of each other, but not for Washington to steal money from those in the country and give to others in the country."" Eatocracy: How do you stretch your food dollars? I am sure Fincher is a good man, but I prefer to listen to Jesus on the role of Christians. After all, he said, ""For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink."" Fincher, like nearly all House Republicans, voted to cut SNAP by $40 billion over ten years. Those cuts would kick 3.8 million Americans off food stamps and end subsidized school lunches for 210,000 hungry children. Some 170,000 of the people who will be kicked off food stamps are veterans -- an especially heartless way to treat those who have worn the uniform. Here's the beauty part: While literally taking food out of the mouths of the hungriest Americans, the House GOP farm bill protects corporate welfare, in the form of subsidized crop insurance (among other programs). Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, somehow manages to talk about this without her head exploding -- which means she has greater self-control than I do. ""Republicans are continuing to protect crop insurance subsidies to some of the wealthiest Americans and at the same time trying to cut the very program that helps keep children, seniors, and disabled individuals out of hunger, the Food Stamp Program,"" she said. ""Unlike food stamps, crop insurance subsidies are not subject to means testing or payment limits. Some farms annually collect more than $1 million in crop insurance."" Eatocracy: How to feed your family from a food bank . DeLauro is too polite to mention that one of the well-to-do welfare recipients is her colleague, Fincher. Fincher has received $3.48 million in taxpayer subsidies for his Tennessee farm, including $70,000 in 2012 alone. By contrast, the average Tennessee food stamp recipient gets $1,586.40 per year. Mark Zandi of Moody's was an economic adviser to the GOP presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain. He studied the effect of various government spending to stimulate the economy. Guess what he said gives us the most bang for the buck -- the single best expenditure we can make to stimulate economic growth? (Drumstick roll, please.) That's right -- food stamps. For every dollar we spend on SNAP, Zandi said, $1.73 surges through the economy: Farmers make more money, truckers haul more food, grocers hire more cashiers. Oh, and hungry people get a meal. It's a win-win-win. So this Thanksgiving I will once again thank God for my family, my freedom, and my food. And pray a little extra for the Republican politicians to help their fellow Americans -- and our economy -- by supporting food stamps. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Begala.","Paul Begala: As we gorge at Thanksgiving, GOP House wants to cut food stamps for millions .

"(CNN) -- Chad Madden's hospital room is dimly lit. His mom and dad, Jacqueline and Bill, fuss around their 38-year-old son, rearranging cards from well-wishers, before taking a seat. Chad, draped in crisp white blankets, lies in a large mechanical bed with his torso elevated. His hands are flat and wide and lie still at his sides. Chad is paralyzed from the neck down. He came to Atlanta's Shepherd Center in April after a skydiving accident. The former Navy seaman did two tours in the Persian Gulf in the early '90s, and after completing college, returned in a civilian capacity. Chad was in California on business when the accident happened. ""We weren't home to receive the call. Our family found out first,"" Jacqueline, 65, recalls. When her brother-in-law relayed the news, ""I wrote everything down,"" she says. ""He'd broken his neck. Then I took a deep breath."" Colorado fire victim films her own evacuation . A competitive skydiver, Chad decided to extend his trip by a day to receive some coaching. It was 3:30 p.m. on March 9, the last jump of the day. Chad was working on speed and accuracy, two of the three factors on which skydivers are judged in competition. He doesn't remember much but can explain what happened. ""I hit the ground, landed on my feet, fell onto my knees and then my face, and broke my C2,"" he says, referring to the vertebra at the nape of his neck. The nerves were severed, and he was left a quadriplegic, confined to his bed and completely dependent on the help of others. He details the accident so matter-of-factly you wouldn't be blamed for thinking he was telling someone else's story, not that of a man who describes himself as ""very adventurous, the guy who doesn't watch TV, the guy who stays on the go."" When Bill and Jacqueline arrived from Mountain Home, Idaho, to the hospital Chad had been taken to, they weren't sure what to expect. ""We didn't know if he was dead or alive,"" Jacqueline remembers. The doctors said Chad hadn't been responding to them. Bill asked, ""What does he need to do to prove he's responsive?"" He needs to open his eyes, the doctors replied. Bill, 71, looked at his son and said, ""Chad, open your eyes."" And he did; just like that. It was as if no one had thought to ask him. Chad's contact lenses were still in his eyes, his dad remembered. Chad had heard about the Shepherd Center after a fellow skydiver broke his back last year. Shepherd is ranked one of America's best rehabilitation hospitals by U.S News and World Report, and it specializes in spinal cord injuries. ""There was no second choice,"" he says. The center provides each patient with a private room and on-site housing for family. Each day Chad is tended to by a team of medical professionals, including an occupational therapist and a physical therapist. Most patients in the spinal cord center have survived an accident that, statistically, should have killed them. Here, they get a second chance. For Chad, that notion isn't always enough to lift his spirits. When asked how he deals with his situation, the tough guy responds without shame: ""A lot of tears."" Luckily, he's got what he calls the best family in the world. While his two brothers, sister and parents are separated by hundreds of miles, they're noticeably close. Help for wildfire evacuees and first responders . On June 18, the Maddens received a second life-changing phone call. A friend from Idaho had devastating news: The Maddens' home of more than 35 years had been torched in a wildfire. The Maddens had lived in their house, 40 miles southeast of Boise, since 1976. A friend was looking after the home and their pets while the couple tended to Chad in Atlanta. The friend managed to escape with the family dog and cat. The tragedy was, however, potentially a blessing. Had the Maddens not been in Atlanta, they could have died. Bill has a lung condition that impedes his mobility, making the prospect of being trapped in a smoke-filled home all the more frightening. Chad says that no matter the danger, his mother would never have left his father's side. ""We would be severely burned or dead,"" Jacqueline said. Even amid the devastation, the Maddens aren't big on wallowing. ""It's hard to know that our stuff is gone, but it's just stuff. Life is from today forward. We're still busy. We still have a life to take care of,"" Jacqueline says. Still, Bill speaks of the photographs they've lost and his war papers that burned. They had cash and important documents stored in a safe that were reduced to ash. Despite the loss, Bill and Jacqueline rely on their faith to get them through. ""God has amazed me at how much we can handle,"" Jacqueline says with a grin on her face. ""My faith and the Lord just hold me up. I have all the things that I want."" Jill Kellner, Chad's occupational therapist, noticed a change in her patient following the fire, one for the better. ""The fire was a turning point in a positive direction. [Chad] found a sense of purpose again because he needs to be a support system for them,"" Kellner said. ""He was quick to find a silver lining."" Kellner works not only to make sure Chad's muscles stay active, but also to prepare him for life after Shepherd. Chad uses a motorized wheelchair that he operates by blowing into a straw. Therapists upped the chair's speed limit after Chad's recent progress, and he zooms off down the hall toward the therapy room, almost taking a tray on wheels with him. Chad's face is full of determination. ""It's more of an education facility than a health care facility,"" he says. It's in therapy that Chad's personality really comes out. His voice softens and his grey-blue eyes shine as he jokes around with Kellner. Knowing that Adele is not her favorite music to listen to at work, Chad says he'd pick an all-Adele playlist for the therapy room if he had the chance. He then glances over to see if she's noticed his cheekiness. He's more serious when he talks about the Idaho wildfire and the tragedy that could have been. Kellner realizes how much Chad's parents mean to his progress â€” physically and mentally. The Maddens' presence in Atlanta may have saved more than their own lives, she said: ""It's a blessing that they were here because it probably saved his life."" Before the fire took their home, Bill and Jacqueline had decided to move to Maryland, where Chad lives, to take care of him. ""We're with him until he kicks us out,"" Jacqueline says. Chad will spend some time at the VA center in Richmond, Virginia, receiving additional care, before he moves back home. His house will also have to be renovated to accommodate his wheelchair and new lifestyle. As for skydiving again, Chad is already trying to schedule his next jump. While most mothers would find this frightening, Jacqueline (who jumped with Chad last year) knows how much it means to him. ""I've always supported it because it's his passion. There are huge risks stepping off the curb. You can't wrap yourself in cotton."" iReporters share their harrowing views of the wildfires .","Chad Madden was paralyzed from the neck down in a March skydiving accident .

"New York (CNN) -- Mourners gathered Thursday for the funeral service of a New York police detective, who died nearly a decade after being exposed to toxic debris while transporting victims in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Kevin Czartyoryski died Sunday after a months-long battle with lung cancer, according to the head of the city's detectives union, Michael Palladino. ""In May, he was cancer free,"" Palladino said. ""Now here we are seven months later and he's passed away."" Czartyoryski developed cancer after years suffering from pulmonary fibrosis, a condition in which the lung tissue becomes thick and scarred. The New York Police Department medical board presumed his condition was caused by the toxic air he breathed while working at ground zero, according to police spokesman Carlos Nieves. Czartoryski joined the police force in 1988 and had most recently been working in its public information office before he retired on disability in 2008. He received a lung transplant in May 2010, just before cancer was discovered in his remaining lung, Palladino said. For months after the collapse of the World Trade Center, he had worked at ground zero, searching for victims' remains and organizing a temporary morgue. ""He loved the NYPD and the work he was doing,"" Palladino said. The 46-year-old Queens native is remembered by friends and colleagues as a respected man with ""a magnificent personality,"" he added. ""On behalf of the entire Police Department I convey my condolences to family and friends of retired Detective Kevin Czartoryski,"" Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said in a written statement on Thursday. ""He was a consummate professional and a cheerful bridge for understanding who will be missed terribly."" Czartoryski had worked as a public affairs officer to the city's gay and transgender community, working as a part of the department's Hate Crime Task Force. Meanwhile in Washington, Senate Republicans derailed a procedural vote on a bill that would provide $7.4 billion in aid and medical coverage to those exposed to toxins following the attacks of September 11, 2001. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg called Thursday's vote ""a tragic example of partisan politics trumping patriotism."" But the James Zadroga 9/11 Health Bill is not the only plan intended to support ground zero workers. Last month a settlement set to pay out hundreds of millions of dollars to ground zero workers concluded a seven-year fight between the city of New York and first responders, who said they were not properly outfitted for search-and-rescue efforts following the attack.","New York police officer, a 9-11 responder, died after battling lung cancer .

"(CNN) -- With the top U.S. automakers in economic survival mode, ""Buy American"" is a frequent cry among those trying to save jobs at home. Georgia trucker Douglas Sullivan says he's concerned more about quality than the origin of a vehicle's parts. But buying a car to benefit the U.S. economy has become an ambiguous, complicated challenge. ""How you define an American car is one of the great conundrums of this world,"" said Dutch Mandel, the editor and associate publisher of AutoWeek. Fewer than half of the parts on some Big Three vehicles are made in the U.S. Looking at a Ford Fusion? It is assembled in Mexico. The Chrysler 300C is assembled in Canada, but its transmission is from Indiana; the brand's V-8 engine is made in Mexico. Engines in the Chevrolet Equinox sport utility vehicle are from China. On the other hand, Toyota's Camry is comprised 80 percent of parts made in the United States, and 56 percent of Toyota's vehicles sold in the U.S. also are made here, according to Toyota spokeswoman Sona Iliffe-Moon. The Toyota Sienna and Tundra also have 80 percent of their parts manufactured in the U.S. ""When you have manufacturers from around the world building cars in the U.S. with 85 percent domestic content -- engine, transmission, assembly -- is that an American car?"" Mandel asked. Or, he asks, is it considered foreign because the profits go back to a foreign country? ""It's truly a global industry,"" said Thomas Klier, a Chicago, Illinois, economist who co-authored ""Who Really Made Your Car?"" an encyclopedic analysis of the auto industry melting pot.  Watch how U.S. auto woes affect Asia » . ""When you think of buying American, you should focus on three points -- its engine, transmission and where it was assembled,"" Klier said. To get that information, read a vehicle's window sticker. U.S. automakers are legally required to detail the origin of a car's parts and its final assembly point. ""Unfortunately, there are few people who know about the sticker or even bother to look at it,"" said Bernard Swiecki, a senior project manager at the nonprofit Center for Automotive Research in Michigan, which follows trends in the industry. The sticker's details were news to Douglas Sullivan, 43, a truck driver from Snellville, Georgia. Though he prefers foreign brands, believing them to be of higher quality, he said he used to favor U.S. brands because he wanted to support American workers. ""I wanted to keep the jobs right here,"" Sullivan said. Swiecki said many people think about image of a brand, rather than the way that brand has evolved over decades as the market has grown more diverse and competitive. ""They will think, 'I'm buying a GM, I'm getting an American car,' "" Swiecki said. Foreign car manufacturers generate billions of dollars in jobs and community infrastructure in the U.S., but there is a difference between Detroit's economic footprint and that of its foreign rivals. The Center for Automotive Research says Detroit's Big Three employed almost 240,000 people in the U.S. at the end of 2007. Foreign makers had about 113,00 U.S. employees at the time.  Watch UAW leader's take on bailout's failure in Senate » . The key difference in how the Big Three and foreign brands support jobs in the U.S. comes outside the factories, according to a 2006 study by the Level Field Institute, a group formed by Big Three retirees in Washington. ""What's driving the difference in jobs ... is investment in research, design, engineering and management,"" Level Field President Jim Doyle said in a statement on the 2006 study. The Center for Automotive Research said the Big Three had 24,000 engineers on U.S. payrolls in 2007. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said its member companies had 3,500 U.S. research and development employees in 2007. Level Field found that every 1,000 vehicles sold by Detroit's Big Three in the U.S. support more than twice as many jobs as 1,000 vehicles sold by foreign nameplates. Most Americans consumers understand that the industry is global, Swiecki said, and they are more savvy than ever in purchasing vehicles. ""For the most part, gone are the days of people going to a car lot and paying a buck to take a swing of a hammer at a foreign-made car,"" Swiecki said. But there are exceptions. A Savannah, Georgia, Ford dealer sold 15 cars last weekend after he ran a radio ad blaming Japan for Detroit's financial funk. While 15 was substantially better than weekends before the ad, dealer O.C. Welch said, it was still about half of the business he did a year ago. ""All you people that buy all your Toyotas and send that money to Japan, you know, when you don't have a job to make your Toyota car payment, don't come crying to me,"" Welch says in the ad. ""All those cars are rice ready. They're not road ready."" Sullivan, who was at an Atlanta, Georgia, dealership Thursday to pick up his American brand minivan from the service department, said he has had a different experience. He said the vehicle has given him trouble, and whenever he replaces it, he'll probably go with a foreign brand, regardless of whether any of the parts were made in the United States. ""What I look for is good gas mileage, and when I pay it off in four or five years, it's still running,"" said Sullivan, who has owned several American and foreign brands. ""It seems I get better quality with a foreign car."" CNN's Jason Hanna and Brad Lendon contributed to this report.","Fewer than half of parts on some Big Three vehicles made in U.S.

"(CNN) -- It's the race that never stops -- come rain, hail or sleet. The Kentucky Derby -- America's most prestigious horse race -- is run annually on the first Saturday in May at Churchill Downs' historic dirt track in Louisville, Kentucky, but this weekend's race has been overshadowed by some torrential downpours. ""This will be our 140th Derby and we haven't postponed one yet,"" Churchill Downs' senior director of communications and media services told Darren Rogers told CNN. ""Lightning or a washout of the track could potentially cause a delay but a postponement would be highly unusual."" Known as ""The Greatest Two Minutes in Sports"" for its approximate run time, the Derby is the first race in horse racing's coveted Triple Crown, which also includes the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes. Churchill Downs has suffered multiple days of heavy rain but even when 2.31 inches of rain fell on Derby day in 1918 the race was run with Exterminator winning. Despite the poor weather, horses, jockeys and trainers have continued to brave the conditions. Tapiture trainer Steve Asmussen said after one session: ""It felt like the priest's round of gold in [the movie] 'Caddyshack.' Only, thank goodness, we didn't get struck by lightning at the end of it."" The storm got so torrential on Monday that training for the big event, for which there is a $2 million purse, had to be delayed by half an hour. The weather two years ago was dire on race day -- the second wettest on record as 1.46 inches of rain fell as I'll Have Another seized the victory -- while last year half an inch of rain fell in the six hours prior to Orb riding to victory. However, wet weather is nothing new to Derby day, the National Weather Service pointing out that 46% of all Derby days have had rain at some point. California Chrome's trainer Art Sherman had been hoping for a fast track to suit the colt and the weathermen have reassured him that it ought to be just that despite the recent downpours. The Kentucky Derby, which is also referred to as ""The Run for the Roses"" due to the garland of 554 red roses draped over the winner, has been known for its varied weather. It enjoyed a record high temperature of 92 degrees Fahrenheit (33.3 degrees Celsius) for the 1959 running, while two years previously the high then was a mere 47 degrees Fahrenheit (8.3 degrees Celsius), and in 1989 sleet even fell for a time. Track conditions ahead of the 140th running of the prestigious thoroughbred race had been sloppy because of the storm system that has brought dire weather and tornadoes to central and southern states in the U.S. The National Weather Service announced early on Wednesday that the nationwide death toll had reached 35, with reports of almost 100 separate destructions that affected approximately 60 million people across the country.

"(CNN) -- A spate of deadly explosions rocked Egypt on Friday, the latest violence in the tumultuous Middle East nation, state news reported. Two of the blasts occurred in the capital of Cairo, including one near a metro station in Ramses that killed one person and injured others, according to the state-run EGYNews agency. Earlier, a police officer died and four other security personnel were injured in an explosion in Heliopolis in downtown Cairo, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency reported. The same agency reported another blast at a traffic checkpoint. Meanwhile, Ahram Online -- another state news agency -- reported a pair of suicide attacks in the Sinai city of El Tur, leaving one dead and nine injured. One of these occurred at a security checkpoint run by police and soldiers, while another happened in the path of a tour bus carrying workers. MENA reported that three people were wounded in this attack 50 kilometers (31 miles) northwest of the Red Sea resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh. Militants based in the Sinai peninsula near the Israeli border have stepped up attacks on soldiers and policemen since the ouster of President Mohamed Morsy. Egypt's first democratically elected president -- succeeding the also deposed Hosni Mubarak -- Morsy was removed from power by the military and later arrested on incitement to conduct murder and other charges. Some of Morsy's supporters turned out -- as they have regularly on Fridays, despite strict restrictions on protests and the banning of the Islamist group that Morsy belonged to, the Muslim Brotherhood -- in Cairo's Helwan district, EGYNews reported. They were met by security forces there to disperse the protesters, Egypt's Interior Ministry said in a statement posted on its Facebook page. The ministry claimed that some of the protesters shot at police. Similar protests, and similar violence, broke out elsewhere. Two Morsy supporters were killed by live ammunition and three suffered injuries west of the port city of Alexandria in what the Interior Ministry described as clashes with angry locals that occurred after Friday prayers. The Interior Ministry reported that security forces ended up apprehending 42 pro-Morsy activists in the governorates of Cairo, Giza, Fayoum and Alexandria.

"If you want to know where American food traditions are headed, look back. Many of today's most healthful eating trends bear a strong resemblance to yesterday's: Nearby farms offering nutritious, peak-of-season produce; slow-cooked dinners that foster leisurely family meals; an emphasis on meatless dishes and minimally processed foods. Sales of organic food have risen more than 20 percent per year since the 1990s, the USDA says. ""It used to be that packaging and convenience were all the rage. But today, food lovers also want to know where their food comes from and how to prepare it in the simplest, most natural way possible,"" says Fern Gale Estrow, M.S., R.D., a community nutritionist based in New York City. ""People still want and need to save time in the kitchen, but they're not willing to sacrifice taste and nutrition to get it."" Fortunately, these five food trends provide exactly that -- flavorful, nutrient-rich meals that are easy to prepare and can help you fulfill many of your dietary requirements. Flexitarianism . Like vegetarians, ""flexitarians"" eat a primarily plant-based diet composed of grains, vegetables, and fruits, but they occasionally obtain protein from lean meat, fish, poultry, or dairy. A quarter of Americans fit the description, consuming meatless meals at least four days a week, according to the American Dietetic Association. Why it's here to stay: Flexitarianism is exactly what dietitians, nutritional researchers, and public health advocates have been recommending for years. ""It's about eating a varied diet that's low in saturated fat and high in fiber,"" says Milton Stokes, M.P.H., R.D., chief dietitian at St. Barnabas Hospital in New York City, and an ADA spokesperson. Because the emphasis is on produce rather than protein, flexitarians are more likely than most Americans to meet the recommended daily intake of fruits and vegetables and the vitamins and minerals they contain. CookingLight.com: Take our quiz on correct serving sizes . What it means for you: Studies show that people who follow this approach to eating generally weigh less and have lower rates of hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and prostate and colon cancer. In one large study from Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana, researchers tracked the eating habits of more than 9,600 people over a 19-year period and found those who consumed fruits and vegetables at least three times daily lowered their risk of stroke by 42 percent, and their risk of cardiovascular disease by 27 percent. Locally grown foods . As people seek fresher foods, they have begun to connect with local family farms. Community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs and farmers' markets give consumers direct access to produce, meats, cheeses, breads, honey, and other foods that are produced in nearby communities. In the past 10 years, the number of local farmers' markets has more than doubled -- it is up from 1,755 to 3,706, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Marketing Service. Why it's here to stay: Because they are so fresh, locally grown fruits and vegetables often have a nutritional edge over produce raised on ""factory"" farms. The latter, which constitutes most of the produce grown in the United States, is picked about four to seven days before it arrives on supermarket shelves, and shipped for an average of 1,500 miles before it's sold, according to Local Harvest, a nonprofit agricultural research group. All that downtime takes a toll. USDA researchers have found that if it's not handled properly, produce can lose up to half its nutrients in transit. Water-soluble nutrients such as vitamin C are particularly vulnerable. What it means for you: ""Buying food from local vendors gives you input,"" says Gail Feenstra, R.D., food systems analyst at the University of California at Davis' Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program. ""You can find out how things were grown. You can also request varieties of fruits and vegetables that wouldn't be available elsewhere."" And then there's the most important reason of all: Because of its freshness, locally grown food tastes better than produce designed to be shipped. ""Growers' priority is on taste and texture versus transportation,"" Feenstra says. Functional foods . Functional foods are enriched with nutrients that may not be inherent to a given food. Familiar examples include orange juice fortified with calcium or milk fortified with vitamins A and D. As sales of these foods have soared in recent years, more functional foods have reached the market, such as eggs and pastas with omega-3 fatty acids, sterol-fortified chocolates and high-fiber, high-protein flours. Why it's here to stay: These foods help many people fill nutritional gaps. ""For example, if you're lactose intolerant, you might find it difficult to meet your calcium quota,"" Stokes says. ""Calcium-fortified juice eliminates that problem, especially if a glass is already part of your daily diet."" Likewise, if you dislike seafood, you can obtain extra omega-3s from eggs or pasta. CookingLight.com: Remembering real portion sizes . What it means for you: Functional foods are one helpful element in maintaining a balanced diet, not a substitute for it. ""Calcium-fortified orange juice won't supply other nutrients that a dairy source would provide, like protein,"" Estrow says. ""That's why it's best to rely on whole foods, which provide multiple nutrients that act synergistically."" In the end, it's fine to reap added nutrients from a functional food, but remember to fulfill the majority of your needs with naturally rich sources. Organic food . These are foods produced following a government-regulated practice of growing and processing that minimizes exposure to pesticides, herbicides, and other chemicals used in traditional farming. Organic food is one of the country's fastest-growing market segments; sales have risen more than 20 percent per year since the 1990s, according to the USDA's Economic Research Service. Why it's here to stay: Some organic foods may provide a nutrition boost. A research review of 41 studies conducted by the University of California at Davis found that, on average, organic produce contains as much as 27 percent more vitamin C, 21 percent more iron, and 29 percent more magnesium compared with traditionally grown foods. The kinds of packaged organic foods that now fuel the category's growth, such as cookies, baked goods, and boxed meals, also benefit from a similar perception of healthfulness. What it means for you: ""An organic stamp isn't necessarily a guarantee of nutritional quality, but it is a sure sign that the food is less adulterated,"" Stokes says. An organic cookie, for example, may have just as many calories and grams of saturated fat as a nonorganic cookie. But in the case of produce crops that are commonly treated with high concentrations of pesticides, such as peaches, apples, and strawberries, choosing organic can minimize your exposure to these chemicals, according to tests conducted by researchers from the Environmental Working Group in Washington, D.C. CookingLight.com: All-star foods that fight for health . Slow food . Launched in Italy 20 years ago by restaurateur Carlo Petrini, ""slow food"" was originally designed to protest the encroachment of fast food on the traditional Mediterranean lifestyle. The trend's principles -- choosing locally grown and produced items, preparing them in traditional ways, and eating with friends and family -- celebrate a relaxed approach to living that provides a welcome contrast to the fast-paced, eat-on-the-run lives many people lead. Why it's here to stay: As with locally grown food, freshness is a key component of the slow food trend. ""Investing the time to choose what's fresh that day will ensure that night's meal will be at its peak nutritionally,"" Stokes says. This principle applies whether you're making a family recipe or dining in a restaurant where the chef selects ingredients based on their seasonal availability. Family togetherness is also an important aspect of the trend. ""Slow food is all about cherishing the eating experience and getting back to what food used to be: a vehicle for drawing people together,"" explains Sara Firebaugh, assistant director of Slow Food USA. What it means for you: Healthful whole foods are a great start, but slow food goes a step beyond good nutrition -- and it's a difficult one to quantify. No scientific studies have conclusively proven that friends and family make better dinner companions than televisions, but the benefits are clear. ""Slow food embraces the psychological component in food choices, meal preparation, and the act of eating,"" Estrow says. ""A healthful diet isn't just about what you eat but how you eat it.""

"(CNN) -- A black bear early Monday chased a family dog into its central Pennsylvania home, where it attacked a husband and wife inside, according to the state game commission and one of the victims. Richard Moyer told CNN that he woke up -- as usual -- at 3 a.m. Monday to get ready for work and let out the dog, Brindy, a husky and pit bull mix. The dog sped off outside into the dark woods around the family home in rural Oliver Township, then began to bark and growl. ""It was a mean type of bark, a growl, I just thought, 'Something isn't right,'"" Moyer said. Moyer got a spotlight to see what was going on. As he shined the light into the morning mist, Brindy suddenly came running back toward the house -- followed, closely behind, by a black bear. The bear chased the dog into the house, where Moyer said it attacked him. The melee woke Moyer's wife Angela, who came down from any upstairs bedroom to help her husband. Then, the bear turned on Angela Moyer. When it did, Brindy jumped on the bear. At that point, Richard Moyer said he rejoined the fray. ""What are you going to do? I kept my head down and just leapt into the bear,"" he said. According to Moyer, the bear became especially aggressive -- grabbing and biting him, as well as clawing at his back and head. That was until, suddenly, the bear walked outside to the patio and simply sat down. ""If it had wanted to kill me I think it had have gone ahead and done it,"" said Moyer. ""I guess (the bear) was just ticked off at the dog and came after me"" State police eventually arrived on the scene along with ambulances, which took the Moyers to Harrisburg Hospital. By then, the bear had left. Angela Moyer was bitten several times and was treated for a cracked vertebra, according to her husband. He added that doctors put in 37 staples extending from one side of the back of his head to the other, in addition to puncture wounds from the bear's claws and teeth. Despite those injuries, by day's end both husband and wife had left the hospital and were home. There, they reunited with their 10-year-old son, who missed the ordeal. ""He's a heavy sleeper, I guess,"" said Richard Moyer. Pennsylvania Game Commission spokesman Gerald Feaser said that black bears are not rare sight in and around Perry County, which he described as ""very rural."" ""To give you an idea, there is one stoplight, and when that happened it was a big shock,"" he said. But it's not often that they attack, said Feaser, claiming that black bears ""are more timid"" than others elsewhere, including in the western United States. ""Usually a bear would be more likely to run from a person or a dog than confront a person or a dog,"" he continued. ""The root cause of most bear encounters in Pennsylvania have been dogs, but usually if a bear smells human scent they'll tuck tail and run."" Feaser said that the Game Commission suspects that the Oliver Township attack was a special circumstance, suspecting that it was likely a female attempting to defend her cubs. He also said there is a ""remote chance"" that the bear may have rabies. Feaser said that a Game Commission officer is out in the area setting traps but, as of late Monday afternoon, the bear remained at large. The only way to test an animal for rabies is after it is dead, meaning that -- if caught -- the bear would likely be killed. ""Public health and safety is our main concern,"" he said. ""If caught, the animal will probably be put down."" As to family it attacked, Richard Moyer said matter-of-factly, ""We're going to be OK."" ""What are the chances?"" he added. ""I can't win the lottery, but I can get attacked by a bear.""","The attack occurred at 3 a.m. Monday in rural Oliver Township, a victim and official say .

"(CNN) -- Al Qaeda's central leadership and its ability to direct operations from beyond its base in Pakistan has diminished, but its affiliate organizations, along with other terror groups, have grown more dangerous, according to a new report from the State Department. ""The terrorist threat continued to evolve rapidly in 2013, with an increasing number of groups around the world - including both AQ affiliates and other terrorist organizations - posing a threat to the United States, our allies, and our interests,"" the annual report on global terrrorism trends found. In the report, the State Department said ongoing efforts to degrade and eliminate the organization led by Ayman al-Zawahiri have ""accelerated the decentralization"" of al Qaeda. But those steps have led to groups like its affiliate in Yemen, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, to take advantage of conditions on the ground to ""broaden and deepen their operations,"" become more autonomous and focus on their own goals of attacking the United States and other western governments. Zawahiri has experienced difficulty in commanding influence and ordering directives throughout the group's affiliate structure, the report said, noting an increase in violent attacks by affiliate groups against civilian populations in their areas of operations. In addition to the more deadly attacks, the decentralization of al-Qaeda has led affiliates to increase their financial independence through increased kidnappings for ransom and criminal activity like extortion and credit card fraud, the report found. Al-Zawahiri: Followers should 'capture Westerners' According to the report, al Qaeda in Yemen is among the most lethal of the affiliate groups and ""continues to pose the most significant threat to the United States and U.S. citizens and interests in Yemen."" The group's leader, Nasir Wahishi, recently elevated to the No. 2 position in al Qaeda's larger network, carried out more than 100 attacks in Yemen in 2013. It continues its focus of directing attacks at the U.S. homeland like the failed 2009 attempt to take down a jetliner over Detroit with the ""Underwear Bomber."" The group has been in the crosshairs of the Yemeni government and U.S. counterterror efforts and was the focus of several military operations against its leadership following the release of a video that showed a large gathering of the group and its senior leadership. Terror attacks on the rise . The report cited 9,707 terrorist attacks in 2013, a 43% increase from 2012, according to statistics compiled by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. Attacks resulted in more than 17,800 deaths and more than 32,500 injuries. The majority took place in Afghanistan, India, Iraq, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Somalia, Syria, Thailand and Yemen. Last year's most lethal incidents were carried out by the Taliban in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, Nigeria's Boko Haram, al Qaeda in Iraq, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and ISIL, according to the report. Snowden's impact . Tina Kaidanow, the State Department's top counterterrorism official, said the revelations by Edward Snowden of classified National Security Agency surveillance programs has degraded America's ability to monitor and prevent terrorist activity. ""It has done damage to our intelligence efforts and it's done damage to our ability to ensure that these groups don't have eyesight on the way that we try and gain intelligence with respect to what they're doing,"" she said. ""So overall, know, it's incredibly damaging when we have these kinds of leaks because, at the end of the day, these groups are better able to assess and judge how we obtain our information."" Syria, Iraq and Africa . The civil war in Syria, with it's increasing sectarian nature, also continues to be a magnet with ""thousands"" of foreign fighters joining violent extremist groups to do battle for or against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the report found. It added that al-Qaeda linked groups, such as al-Nusrah Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, remain a serious threat. The Iraqi group, which has had some differences with core al-Qaeda and Zawahiri, was found in the report to have conducted some of the most lethal attacks in the world last year. While Iran and its Shia proxies led by the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah continue to support the al-Assad regime, many foreign jihadists are traveling to Syria to fight with al Qaeda-aligned groups like the Nusra Front. A number of governments are concerned those fighters will eventually return to their home countries to carry out attacks of their own. Next door in Iraq, a weak security environment in the western section of the country along with the de-stabilizing effects of the situation in Syria have allowed a former al Qaeda affiliate, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, to move across the border with ease to conduct its own attacks. Terrorist groups operating in ungoverned areas of Africa also continue to pose a threat. While the report cites operations by al-Shabaab in east Africa, and terrorist groups operating in Nigeria, Mali and Algeria, the report also singles out Libya as an area of concern and instability. ""Libya's porous borders, the weakness of Libya's nascent security institutions, and large amounts of loose small arms create opportunities for violent extremists,"" the report said.","State Department report says al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen particularly lethal .
Al Qaeda Central has had difficulty commanding influence and ordering directives .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan said Saturday it will reassess its relationship with the United States, NATO and the International Security Assistance Force in the wake of a deadly attack by NATO forces on two military checkpoints inside Pakistani territory, marking a major setback in worsening U.S.-Pakistan relations. ""The prime minister will take the Parliament into confidence on the whole range of measures regarding matters relating to Pakistan's future cooperation with US/NATO/ISAF, in the near future,"" Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani's office said in a statement. The attack by NATO helicopters killed 24 soldiers and wounded 13 others in Mohmand Agency, one of seven districts in the volatile region bordering Afghanistan, the Pakistani foreign ministry and military said in a statement. ""It's a huge incident,"" Syed Masood Kausar, governor of northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, told reporters in Islamabad. Many of the wounded were in critical condition, military officials said. The officials did not want to be identified because they are not allowed to talk to the news media. A spokesman for the NATO-led ISAF, Gen. Carsten Jacobson, said close air support had been called in during an operation with Afghan national security forces and ISAF in the rugged border area in the east of Pakistan, where the border is not always clear. ""A technical situation developed on the ground that caused the force to call for close air support and it is this close air support that highly likely caused the soldiers that perished on the Pakistani side,"" he told CNN. He said he could not discuss casualty numbers, since ""they can only come at the moment from the Pakistani side."" ""This incident has my highest personal attention and my commitment to thoroughly investigate it to determine the facts,"" U.S. Marine Gen. John R. Allen, NATO's commander in Afghanistan, said Saturday. He also offered his ""sincere and personal heartfelt condolences"" to the families of any Pakistan Security Forces members killed or injured. In a joint statement, the U.S. State and Defense departments said they are monitoring the reports and issued their condolences. The departments' secretaries, Hillary Clinton and Leon Panetta respectively, said they support NATO's plan to investigate. ""In their contacts, these U.S. diplomatic and military leaders each stressed -- in addition to their sympathies and a commitment to review the circumstances of the incident -- the importance of the U.S.-Pakistani partnership, which serves the mutual interests of our people,"" the statement said. Panetta shares Allen's regret for any loss of life, said Pentagon spokesman Capt. John Kirby. The spokesman for the Pakistan military, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, condemned the strike. ""There is absolutely no justification for this unprovoked and indiscriminate attack,"" Abbas told CNN. ""There is no confusion about the locations of these check posts. They are well inside the border, they are clearly marked and NATO has their location on their maps."" Abbas rejected any NATO claim that NATO aircraft were pursuing insurgents who were crossing into Pakistan. ""There are no more safe havens in Mohmand. We have cleared them. They would have nowhere to hide,"" he said. He told CNN there had been ""no militant activity, to the best of our knowledge,"" in the area at the time, and that the border posts targeted were old and marked, and were supposed to be identified on the maps of NATO pilots operating near the border. Two of the dead were officers, he said. ""Let's wait for an investigation,"" he said. ""Only then, the real truth will come out. But, on the face of it, we have lost 24 of our soldiers and officers, which is highly tragic and is not acceptable."" He cited similar incidents in the past for having resulted in ""a great resentment"" toward the NATO forces. After a meeting Saturday of the Defense Committee of the Cabinet, the prime minister's office released a statement condemning the attack and saying it had ""gravely dented the fundamental basis of Pakistan's cooperation with NATO/ISAF against militancy and terror."" The committee added that it decided to ask the United States to vacate the Shamsi Airbase within 15 days. The base, in southwest Pakistan, is reportedly used for CIA drone strikes. A similar demand was made in June, when Pakistan's defense minister called for the United States to leave the airbase used to launch drone attacks against Taliban and al Qaeda targets on the border with Afghanistan, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan reported then. ""We have told them (the U.S. officials) to leave the airbase,"" Defense Minister Ahmed Mukhtar told reporters about Shamsi Airbase in Balochistan, APP reported. Mukhtar added that trust between the United States and Pakistan had eroded in the aftermath of the May 2 killing of Osama bin Laden by U.S. special forces acting inside the town of Abbottabad, Pakistan, without Islamabad's knowledge or permission. But the Americans never left, according to embassy sources in Islamabad and Pakistani military officials. In a statement, Gilani said he ""strongly condemned the NATO/ISAF attack on the Pakistani"" checkpoint. The matter is being taken up by the Foreign Ministry ""in the strongest possible terms"" with NATO and the United States, the statement from his office said. U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan, Cameron Munter, said: ""I regret the loss of life of any Pakistani servicemen, and pledge that the United States will work closely with Pakistan to investigate this incident."" In response to the attack, Pakistan closed NATO's two supply routes into Afghanistan, Pakistani military and intelligence officials said. NATO trucks have used the routes, in Khyber Agency and Balochistan, to supply U.S. and international forces fighting in Afghanistan. About 50 containers and trucks carrying supplies for NATO were stopped at the town of Jamrud in Khyber Agency on Saturday morning, said Jamil Khan, a senior government official in Khyber Agency, bordering Afghanistan. They were ordered to turn back toward Peshawar, the provincial capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, he said. A second route from Pakistan into Afghanistan, the Chaman border crossing in Balochistan province, had been open to NATO supply trucks earlier Saturday but was shut in the afternoon, the military and intelligence officials said. Roughly 40% of nonlethal NATO supplies and fuel go through Pakistan, with hundreds of supply trucks using the two routes into Afghanistan. In addition, the spokesman for the government of Balochistan, Kamran Asad, said the provincial government had banned the entry of NATO supplies. About 130,000 troops are deployed in Afghanistan with ISAF, 90,000 of them American, according to NATO figures. Pakistani politicians responded angrily to the incident in Mohmand. ""This is the time to be united as a nation and to punch NATO with a fist,"" said Ahmed Khan Bahadur, a provincial lawmaker from the Awami National Party, the ruling party of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. ""NATO could never dare if we were united."" Former international cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, who heads the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, said it was time for Pakistan to pull out of the U.S.-led ""war on terror."" The incident could be the deadliest for Pakistani soldiers involving NATO since a U.S. airstrike in June 2008, which Pakistan said killed 11 of its forces who were cooperating with the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan. That airstrike, also in Mohmand Agency, prompted the government in Islamabad to summon the U.S. ambassador and lodge an official protest. NATO's Allen had met Thursday with the Pakistani Chief of Army Staff Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the Pakistani military said. ""The visiting dignitary remained with him for some time and discussed measures concerning coordination, communication and procedures between Pakistan army, ISAF and Afghan army, aimed at enhancing border control on both sides,"" a Pakistani military statement said. U.S. Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke with Kayani on Saturday to express his condolences, according to Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan. ""He noted the immediate investigation by ISAF to determine what happened,"" Lapan said. CNN's Barbara Starr, Reza Sayah and Nasir Habib in Islamabad contributed to this report.","NEW: The U.S. State and Defense departments say they are monitoring the reports .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Liang Wengen, China's richest man, received the green light to become a candidate for the Communist Party of China's Central Committee. If elected, Liang will be the first private entrepreneur to join the ruling party's policymaking body. Liang, 55, is chairman and founder of Sany Group, China's largest heavy machinery company. Both Forbes and Hurun China Rich List rank him on top of their 2011 rich list, estimating his wealth at $9.3 billion and $10.7 billion, respectively. He Zhenlin, Sany Group's vice president, confirmed with CNN that ""Liang has passed qualification checks"" as a candidate for a seat as alternate member of the Central Committee. Liang is ""waiting for (formal) election,"" which will take place late next year. The Central Committee is an important body in China's top-down political structure. Every five years, delegates to communist party congress elect over 200 full-fledged members and about 150 alternate members. Members of the Central Committee select among themselves members of the party's political bureau, or politburo, and its standing committee comprised of nine members. The Central Committee typically meets four times a year to discuss and approve major policies. In between these meetings - called Plenums in communist parlance -major decisions are made by the Politburo, headed by party chief and state president Hu Jintao. Its members meet more frequently. Liang became a communist member in 2004. Since then, he has been a delegate to the National People Congress (NPC), China highest legislative body. He was also a delegate to the last Communist Party Congress in 2007. Liang has three times applied to become a party member but he was rejected each time. The last time he was rejected was because ""the Party Constitution didn't allow recruiting private entrepreneurs who hire more than seven employees,"" Fu Hongze, a director at the Sany Group, told CNN. Liang's party membership came after former Chinese president Jiang Zemin pushed through the controversial notion that private business owners may also join the Communist Party in 2001. ""Currently there are very few party members working in the private sector,"" notes Tang Wenfang, author of the book ""Public Opinion and Political Change in China."" ""There is a need to correct this imbalance by recruiting non-party private entrepreneurs, as this group of people is gaining economic power. If they are not co-opted, they can potentially wield independent political influence."" Rupert Hoogewerf, who has served as chief researcher for Hurun Rich list for many years, says Liang's expected election into the Central Committee is largely symbolic. He points out that the private sector is ""clearly an important player now in the economy as a whole,"" creating new jobs and paying substantial taxes. ""It is a symbiotic relationship,"" he says. ""They help each other out."" If Liang is elected next year, Hoogewerf adds, his new political status will be a morale boost for China's private sector and may also benefit his company, the Sany Group., which Liang founded in 1989. It will not be the first time for Liang to work with the ruling party. He and his company have been involved in high-profile partnerships with the Chinese government. ""It wasn't a coincidence that Sany was in Chile to rescue the trapped miners last year,"" Hoogewerf tells CNN. ""The Chinese government offered to help and Liang was the person asked to make it happen on behalf of the government. It was a big thing."" Sany provided heavy machinery during the rescue efforts. During the devastating Sichuan earthquake in 2008, Liang donated 3 million yuan (US$ 461,000) in cash and 15 million yuan (about $ 2.3 million) worth of heavy machinery, according to state media reports. Sany's volunteer rescue team arrived in the worst hit area within two days after the earthquake hit. ""Liang's increased political capital will help push Sany's dominance to a higher level in both domestic and international market."" said Wang Zhengxu at the University of Nottingham.

"(CNN) -- Politics abhors a vacuum, and the ""Bridgegate scandal"" engulfing Chris Christie has severely compromised the New Jersey governor's ability to launch a campaign for president, opening a space that Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, seems likely to fill. ""The idea that he's the prohibitive front-runner is over"" is how one Republican strategist described Christie's plight to the conservative National Review. At stake is the future of the Republican Party, which has been divided for several years by a simmering fight between factions -- ultra-conservative Tea Party activists and more moderate establishment figures who control key party offices. Christie and Bush are both frequently mentioned as mainstream candidates that the establishment would like to see run in 2016. But Christie's status as a party favorite has faltered, while Bush appears to be on the rise. The contrast was on display at Saturday's White House Correspondents' Dinner, the high-profile, televised black-tie event in which the nation's media and political elites take satirical jabs at one another. Nobody got rougher treatment from the podium than Christie, especially from comedian Joel McHale, the evening's emcee. ""I promise that tonight will be both amusing and over quickly -- just like Chris Christie' s presidential bid,"" quipped McHale, who later harped on the apparently politically motivated traffic tie-up near the George Washington Bridge that has led to the firing and resignation of top Christie aides. ""Finally, a politician willing to stand up to America's commuters,"" deadpanned McHale. Bush, by contrast, escaped with a passing mention as a top presidential contender. Christie's bad news shows up in polls that can't be dismissed as a joke. In a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll of all Americans, Bush ranked at the top of a list of Republican presidential contenders with a 14% showing; Christie's was 10%. A Fox News poll taken last month shows that among Republicans, Bush has a 52% approval rating compared with Christie's 46%. After talking with more than 24 top Republican donors, reporters from The New York Times concluded in a recent article that ""some of them are signaling to Mr. Christie's camp that, should Mr. Bush enter the race, their first loyalty would be to him, not to Mr. Christie."" That's a sea change from recent years, when Christie, a prodigious fund-raiser, wielded tight control over his New Jersey donors. According to Washington Post commentator Dan Balz, when candidate Mitt Romney came seeking support, in 2011, Christie said he told him: ""If you raise money in New Jersey in any kind of aggressive, organized way, it's going to make it very unlikely that I'll be able to support you."" Things have changed. With Christie hemorrhaging support, a number of New Jersey heavy hitters are now openly agonizing over whether to stick with Christie or invest in a Bush candidacy. Bush brings multiple advantages: Having a father and brother who were presidents means there are legions of Republicans, across multiple generations, who owe personal and political loyalty to the closest thing the GOP has to a royal family. On the hot-button issue of immigration reform, Bush has staked out an independent position, calling on Republicans to move away from ""harsh rhetoric"" on the issue and co-authoring a book on the subject -- an implicit recognition that winning the White House in 2016 will require support from Latinos and other pro-immigration voters. Most importantly, Bush remains untouched by scandal, while Christie must cope with a scandal that just won't go away. Last week, an attorney for David Samson, a close adviser and mentor of Christie's, announced that Samson will not answer subpoenas from a state legislative committee investigating Bridgegate, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. It's another crippling blow to Christie's presidential hopes. Samson, named by Christie to serve as chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, oversaw the multibillion-dollar agency that runs the George Washington Bridge until he was forced to resign as the scandal unfolded. Samson is the most prominent among several Christie aides who have quit or been fired and have now lawyered up. That means we'll see court fights around memos, meetings and other crucial evidence for months to come -- months during which Christie's nascent candidacy will continue to decline, leaving Bush looking like the white knight for which the Republican establishment has been waiting.","Errol Louis: ""Bridgegate"" has hurt Christie's chances, cleared way for Jeb Bush in 2016 .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Chris Brown must stay locked up in the Los Angeles County jail for at least another week while his lawyer negotiates with the prosecutor about his probation violation, a judge said Thursday. Brown attended a hearing Thursday wearing an orange jail suit, just hours after a cross-country trip from Washington to Los Angeles on the federal government's inmate transport system, informally known as ""Con Air."" ""He's doing remarkably well under the circumstances,"" Brown lawyer Mark Geragos told CNN. ""It's a challenging situation to be in."" Geragos and Assistant District Attorney Mary Murray agreed to hold talks over the next week concerning Brown possibly admitting that he violated his probation. If that happens, it will be announced at a hearing next Friday. Otherwise, the judge will set a date for a trial on his probation revocation. ""I'm hoping we get it resolved and we get it resolved quickly,"" Geragos said after the hearing. Geragos said he would also file a motion to have Brown released from jail, which would be considered at the May 9 hearing. Brown, who turns 25 next Monday, spent most of the past week traveling back to Los Angeles following a delay in the start of his trial on a misdemeanor assault charge in Washington. U.S. Marshals, who took Brown from the Los Angeles County jail for extradition to Washington four weeks ago, handed him back to Los Angeles Sheriff's deputies just hours before Thursday's hearing, according to Deputy U.S. Marshal Laura Vegas. Brown's probation for the 2009 beating of ex-girlfriend Rihanna Fenty was revoked after his Washington arrest. He's spent the past six weeks in custody and previous five months in court-ordered rehab. The prosecutor said last week that she would ""strenuously object"" to Brown being released because it appears likely Brown will be found guilty of the assault charge in Washington. Assistant District Attorney Mary Murray argued the only change since Brown was jailed in March is that his case has ""gotten worse."" The Washington judge who found his bodyguard guilty in the assault case also concluded that Brown was ""the initial aggressor"" in the incident, Murray said. A Los Angeles judge refused a request last week to free the singer from custody so he could make his own way back from Washington. He and bodyguard Christopher Hollosy were arrested on assault charges in Washington for allegedly beating a man who tried to take a photo of Brown last October. The arrest led to a revocation of Brown's probation, but he was allowed to enter a rehab program instead of going to jail. He was ordered to jail last month when he was kicked out of the rehab program for rules violations. Planes, chains and automobiles: Chris Brown's miserable trip to trial . ""I think it's a little over the top to have him in custody on this misdemeanor when everybody saw the bodyguard's trial and which was nothing more than a bloody nose,"" Brown lawyer Mark Geragos told reporters in Washington last week. ""And you have got the bodyguard who was convicted and who readily admitted he was the one who did the punching.Â So all of this is much ado about nothing."" Chris Brown's freedom at stake with 2 cases . The delay in Brown's Washington trial came after prosecutors refused to grant immunity to Hollosy so he could testify without jeopardizing his own case. On Monday, Hollosy was found guilty of assaulting a man on a Washington sidewalk before Brown's trial was to begin in the case. The prosecutors cited Hollosy's refusal to talk to them about his testimony as a major reason for the decision not to grant immunity. Their motion also said they suspected he might lie in his testimony to help Brown.","NEW: ""He's doing remarkably well under the circumstances,"" Brown lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- An American arrested after a car bombing in northern Sinai in August was found dead in an Egyptian police station Sunday, authorities said. The man -- identified as James Lunn by a U.S. State Department official -- was discovered hanging by his shoelaces and a belt from a bathroom door in a waiting area of the Awal police station in Ismailia, Egypt, public prosecutor Hisham Barakt said. An investigation has been ordered to determine if the death was a suicide, Barakt said. Lunn was taken into custody on August 27 after a car bomb exploded near a police station in northern Sinai, according to a statement from Egypt's Interior Ministry.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The State Department will renew its contract with Blackwater to provide security in Iraq, Greg Starr, acting assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security, said Friday. An woman passes a burnt car in a Baghdad neighborhood where Blackwater guards killed 17 in September. No provisions have been added to the contract, Starr said, but Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ordered several changes to procedure after a September incident in which Blackwater guards shot and killed 17 people, including women and children. The incident placed the operations of Blackwater and other security firms under scrutiny in Iraq, where an estimated 25,000 private contractors protect diplomats, reconstruction workers and government officials. Under a provision instituted in the early days of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, security contractors have immunity from Iraqi law. The five-year State Department contract, which began in 2006, must be renewed every year and is up for renewal next month. Starr said, in effect, Blackwater's contract will roll over for another year. Blackwater is one of three contractors working under a ""task order"" to provide security services in Iraq. The other two are Triple Canopy and DynCorp. An agreement, or memorandum of understanding, between the State Department and U.S. military calls for a higher level of coordination and supervision of contractors, Starr said. Blackwater still has to work under the rules of the Iraqi government, he said. The FBI is in charge of the U.S. investigation of the September incident, in which survivors and victims' family members said Blackwater guards started shooting unprovoked. Blackwater said its employees were returning fire after coming under attack from armed insurgents, but an Iraqi investigation called the killings ""premeditated murder."" Starr said the U.S. government, in particular U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker, will take a close look at the FBI's investigation report and then ""decide whether it is consistent with U.S. goals and policies to continue the contract."" He said it will be important to see whether the FBI finds Blackwater itself criminally responsible, or merely a few of its employees. ""We can terminate contracts for the convenience of the government if we have to,"" he said. ""I am not going to prejudge what the FBI is going to find in its investigation. It's complex. I think the U.S. government needs protective services."" Starr said he did have some concern about the reaction of the Iraqi government and people. But he noted that there have been only three additional ""escalation of forces"" incidents since the new rules of engagement. ""I am up to this point very satisfied with the changes we have seen,"" he said. ""Essentially I think they do a very good job. The September 16 incident was a tragedy, it needs to be investigated carefully. The results of that will come out of that eventually and we will decide how we will proceed.""

"London (CNN) -- Australian children's entertainer Rolf Harris, 84, was found guilty Monday in a London court of 12 charges of sexually abusing women and girls as young as 7 years old. The musician and artist, who painted a portrait of the Queen for the monarch's 80th birthday in 2006, had been charged under Operation Yewtree, which is investigating allegations of decades of abuse by public figures, including the late TV entertainer Jimmy Savile. The offenses that Harris committed against four women took place as far back as 1970. He was released on bail until Friday, when he will be sentenced; the judge, Justice Sweeney, warned him he could face jail, the Press Association reported. Dozens more women who said they had been abused by the entertainer, including several in Australia, alerted police during the trial, PA added. Speaking outside Southwark Crown Court after the verdict, Detective Mick Orchard told reporters: ""Rolf Harris has habitually denied any wrongdoing, forcing his victims to recount their ordeal in public. ""He committed many offenses in plain sight of people as he thought his celebrity status placed him above the law. I want to thank the women who came forward for their bravery. I hope today's guilty verdict will give them closure and help them to begin to move on with their lives. ""Today's case and verdict once again shows that we will always listen to, and investigate allegations regardless of the time frame or those involved."" Harris was once one of Britain's best-loved children's entertainers. He had a string of hits in the 1960s, including ""Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport,"" ""Jake the Peg"" and ""Two Little Boys."" He had a decades-long television career at the BBC and received several honors, including the Order of the British Empire.","Rolf Harris is found guilty in a London court of 12 charges of sexual abuse .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby was disbarred from practicing law in the nation's capital on Thursday. I Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby was convicted to lying to a grand jury and investigators last year. The former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney was convicted last year of lying to a grand jury and federal agents probing the leak of the identity of a CIA operative, Valerie Plame Wilson. ""When a member of the Bar is convicted of an offense involving moral turpitude, disbarment is mandatory,"" the District of Columbia Court of Appeals wrote in its opinion, which is posted on its Web site. ""When convictions on more than one count are involved, disbarment is mandated if any one of them involves moral turpitude,"" the court added. Last July, a court sentenced Libby to a 30-month prison term. President Bush later commuted Libby's sentence, calling it ""excessive."" Despite the commutation, Libby still had to pay a $250,000 fine and serve two years probation. Unlike a presidential pardon which wipes a person's crimes off the books, Bush's commutation of Libby's sentence only means that he does not have to serve the prison sentence. He is still considered guilty of the crime he was convicted. The president stopped short of an outright pardon, noting that ""our entire system of justice relies on people telling the truth."" The clemency grant raised eyebrows among legal observers and prompted criticism from Democrats. William Jeffress, one of the attorneys who helped defend Libby in the criminal trial, told CNN, ""We are not surprised by the appeals court decision, because clearly under the rules this is automatic."" Jeffress could not say whether Libby might apply for reinstatement if he is pardoned. He gave no indication such a pardon is anticipated. Although the White House has declined to say whether Bush might go beyond his decision to commute Libby's jail time, both Bush and Cheney have expressed strong support for Libby. Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told CNN a presidential pardon could indeed open the door for Libby to try to regain his license to practice law. ""Whether it would be granted is another matter,"" she said, given ethics standards that a bar would normally consider. Sloan's group is pursuing a civil suit on behalf of Plame Wilson, claiming damage from White House disclosures of her identity and connection to the CIA. Although the suit has been rejected by a federal court, the group Friday will file a brief ahead of an appeals argument May 9. Case history dating back to the Iran-Contra affair of the 1980s could affect Libby's prospects for regaining his law license if he is granted a full pardon. Elliott Abrams, an assistant secretary of state during the Reagan administration, received a full presidential pardon for making false and misleading statements to Congress. Lawmakers had investigated illicit U.S. arms sales to Nicaraguan rebels at a time Congress had voted to halt such aid. An appeals court in 1995 rejected a Washington law board's proposed suspension and sanctions against Abrams, concluding that ""a full and unconditional presidential pardon attached not just to the criminal conviction, but also to the conduct that was or may have been the basis of the conviction.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The State Department will not renew the contract of security contractor Blackwater Worldwide when it expires in May, a senior State Department official said Friday. Heavily armed Blackwater guards scan downtown Baghdad, Iraq, from a helicopter in 2003. The decision was made after the Iraqi government refused last week to renew the firm's operating license because of a 2007 incident in which the Iraqi government says security guards -- then employed by Blackwater -- fired on and killed 17 Iraqis. Blackwater's latest ""task order"" expires in May, and the senior official said that ""one of the conditions is that you have to have a license"" to continue working in the country. ""No license, no renewal,"" the official said. ""If they don't have a license to operate, we would certainly not renew the task order."" The official said the decision would not affect other contracts Blackwater has with the State Department to protect American diplomats around the world. As part of a contract to protect American diplomats and other employees worldwide, the State Department hired Blackwater for a multiyear assignment in Iraq, renewable each year. Blackwater, one of three security firms working for the United States in Iraq, has one of the biggest security contracts there. Officials said the State Department is talking with security firms DynCorp International and Triple Canopy, which share the Iraq contract with Blackwater, about picking up Blackwater's duties. The Iraqi government has been unclear about when Blackwater will have to cease operations. But the official said, ""We are working to make sure our people are protected."" Losing the contract will be a huge blow to Blackwater. It has been estimated that the Iraq contract makes up one-third to one-half of the privately held company's business. Blackwater has about two dozen aircraft in Iraq and 1,000 personnel. Earlier this month, five former Blackwater security guards pleaded not guilty to charges of voluntary manslaughter and other serious crimes stemming from their involvement in the September 16, 2007, shootings in a Baghdad square. A sixth former security guard has pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter.  Watch why Blackwater is notorious among Iraqis » . Blackwater says its employees were returning fire after they were attacked by armed insurgents. An Iraqi investigation concluded that the guards randomly fired at civilians without provocation. The company does not face charges. But the Baghdad incident exacerbated the feelings of many Iraqis that private American security contractors have operated since 2003 with little regard for Iraqi law or life. The indictment of the five men represents the first prosecution of non-Defense Department contractors under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act. The act was amended in 2004 to allow the Justice Department to prosecute such personnel providing services ""in support of the mission of the Department of Defense overseas."" The recently approved U.S.-Iraqi security agreement specifies that U.S. civilian contractors will no longer be immune from Iraqi prosecution for crimes committed in that country. Iraq has required the licensing of private security companies since 2004, but the provision was not strictly enforced. Last year, the State Department renewed Blackwater's contract over strong objections from the Iraqi government. Starting January 1, the Iraqi government has mandated that all contractors obtain licenses to operate. As of Wednesday, Blackwater said it had not been officially notified of any Iraqi decision not to renew its license. CNN's Suzanne Simons contributed to this report.","Contract expires in May and won't be renewed, State Department says .

"(CNN) -- Sugar-sweetened beverages are linked to more than 180,000 obesity-related deaths worldwide each year, according to new research presented this week at an American Heart Association conference. ""This means about one in every 100 deaths from obesity-related diseases is caused by drinking sugary beverages,"" says study author Gitanjali Singh, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health. Among the world's 35 largest countries, Mexico had the highest death rates from sugary drinks, and Bangladesh had the lowest, according to the study. The United States ranked third. However, the American Beverage Association dismissed the research as ""more about sensationalism than science."" Opinion: Banning large sodas is legal and smart . When people drink too many beverages containing added sugar, such as soft drinks, fruit drinks, energy or sports beverages, they tend to put on weight. The study authors say these added pounds increase the risk of developing diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers -- conditions often referred to as obesity-related diseases. Researchers at Harvard wanted to find out how often people around the globe drank sugar-sweetened beverages and how that affected their risk of death. They looked at 114 national dietary surveys covering more than 60% of the world's population. They also used evidence from studies published in medical journals that discussed sugary drinks and other dietary habits. Their data was included in the 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study, which looks at the health and mortality of populations across the world. How did the Harvard scientists single out that sweet drinks were linked to weight gain and death? They spent several years gathering and combing through data. They looked at all kinds of factors that can affect our weight such as TV watching, changes in physical activity levels, smoking and the consumption of all kinds of food and drink. When the researchers controlled for these factors, they were able to determine what percentage of deaths from diabetes, heart disease and cancer were linked to sugary drinks. ""The investigators examined changes in sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and then its association with change in body fatness or BMI (body mass index), and subsequent deaths from cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer,"" says Rachel Johnson, professor of nutrition at the University of Vermont in Burlington and chair of the American Heart Assocation's Nutrition Committee, who was not involved in the study. Opinion: 'Anti-Bloomberg' bill stops overregulation . Scientists found that more people died from diabetes, heart disease and cancer in parts of the world where consumption of sugary drinks is high. Of the nine world regions in 2010, Latin America and the Caribbean had the most diabetes deaths linked to sugary drinks with 38,000. East and Central Eurasia had the most cardiovascular deaths at 11,000. In the United States, sugary drinks were linked to the deaths of 25,000 people from diabetes and other obesity-related diseases. As in many other countries, the death rates were highest in young adults under age 45, with one in 10 obesity-related deaths associated with sugary beverages. ""Almost three-quarters of the deaths caused by sugary drinks are in low and middle income countries,"" says study author Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, co-director of the cardiovascular epidemiology program at the Harvard School of Public Health. ""So this is not just a problem in wealthy nations."" The average consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages in Mexico, the country with the highest death rates among larger nations, was 24 ounces per day. The American Beverage Association released this statement in response to the study: . ""This abstract, which is neither peer-reviewed nor published, is more about sensationalism than science. In no way does it show that consuming sugar-sweetened beverages causes chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease or cancer - the real causes of death among the studied subjects. ""The researchers make a huge leap when they illogically and wrongly take beverage intake calculations from around the globe and allege that those beverages are the cause of deaths which the authors themselves acknowledge are due to chronic disease."" Judge stops NYC ban on large sugary drinks, city plans appeal . The study authors and other experts disagree. ""We know having an elevated BMI is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes and some cancers,"" says Johnson. ""The body does not seem to detect fullness as well when you drink sugary drinks. That is one explanation for why sugar-sweetened beverages are associated with obesity."" Recently the American Heart Association came out with a scientific statement about sugar intake and heart health because it says there is new evidence about the relationship between the two. The statement says some research has found a link between sugar consumption and cardiovascular disease, while other research has not found a direct link. The AHA says that the best way to maintain a healthy weight and to decrease the risk of heart disease is to eat a healthy diet and to limit added sugar to no more than 100 calories a day for women and 150 for men. Soft drinks and other sugar-sweetened beverages are the main source of added sugars in the American diet, according to the statement. One 12-ounce regular soda contains the equivalent of 10 teaspoons of sugar and has about 140 calories.

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A Spanish court says it is investigating an alleged ""crime against humanity"" involving Israel for its 2002 bombing in Gaza that killed 15 people and wounded 150 others. The case names former Israeli Defense Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer and six other Israelis. The case, brought by Palestinian relatives of some of the deceased, names former Israeli Defense Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer and six other Israeli top military commanders and security officials at the time. The National Court said it has jurisdiction to investigate the case, and that initial evidence suggests the bombing ""should be considered a crime against humanity,"" according to a copy of the court order viewed by CNN on Thursday. Edwin Yabo, spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Madrid, said Israel would not comment until it receives formal notification of the case. He said he learned about the court's decision through a phone call from CNN. The National Court previously has taken on other high-profile human rights cases outside of Spain, such as charges against former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and more recently against former military leaders of El Salvador. The court argues that if a potential human rights crime is not being investigated by the country in question, Spain can proceed, under international law. The Israeli case involves the July 22, 2002 bombing in Gaza of the home of a suspected Hamas commander, Salah Shehadeh, the seven-page court order said. The blast killed him, but also members of a Palestinian family, whose last name is Mattar. They lived next door. Some of their relatives brought the suit to the court last August. The court said that, while it initially considered whether to accept the case or not, it asked Israel for information, but ""as of today, Israeli authorities have not complied with the request for international judicial cooperation."" So the court formally took on the case. The next likely step would be for the Spanish investigating magistrate handling the case, Judge Fernando Andreu, to put the seven Israelis named in the suit under official investigation. That is equivalent to preliminary charges, which could lead later to an indictment, a National Court spokeswoman told CNN. The Israelis named in the case, besides former defense minister Ben-Eliezer, are the following former officials: Dan Halutz, Israeli air force commander at the time; Doron Almog, a general in charge of Israel's southern command; Giora Eiland, president of the national security council; Michael Herzog, a senior defense ministry official, Moshe Ya'alon, head of the Israeli defense forces and Abraham Dichter, a senior security official. The court said it will notify Israel to request that those named in the complaint be formally notified, so that they could called by the Spanish court to testify.","Spanish court to investigate alleged ""crime against humanity"" involving Israel .

"(CNN) -- Table flipping. Hair pulling. Name calling. Glass chucking. Fist throwing. Who needs scripted dialogue when women are willing to physically and emotionally exchange blows for the camera? MTV's ""Jersey Shore,"" the mega-hit known for both male and female brawls, featured yet another bar fight on Thursday night's episode. Despite hyping the altercation between cast member Sammi Giancola and a female club-goer in a promo for the show, the scene was treated like any other segment. Catfights have become practically de rigueur for many cable and network reality series. Shows like ""The Bachelor,"" ""Mob Wives,"" ""The Real Housewives"" and ""Love & Hip Hop"" all seemingly rely on female cast members' aggressive behavior for ratings. The genre has become more about shock TV than reality TV, said Steve Carbone, who runs the spoiler site Realitysteve.com. That said, ""If you're shocked by what you see (on reality TV), you shouldn't be,"" he said. For almost a decade, viewers have watched 25 to 30 women vie for the attention of one man each season on ABC's ""The Bachelor."" And if the majority of catfights on reality TV have taught us anything, it's that viewers love watching women fight over a man. So what's shocking about the current season's villain, Courtney, who said she'd like to ""verbally assault"" and ""rip another girl's head off""? Carbone rhetorically asked. ""People, two years ago, were saying the exact same thing about Vienna."" Mary McClelland, who contributes to the reality TV site Reality Tea, said viewers are still shocked by cattiness and girl-on-girl violence despite no longer being appalled by it. ""Viewers almost revel in it ... in an excited way,"" she said, adding that stories about catfights on reality shows elicit the most comments on Reality Tea. Judging by the comments, people seem to be annoyed by the constant cattiness on such shows, McClelland said, adding, ""Maybe people like the cringe factor."" And so producers routinely cast women who will be controversial. As Shaunie O'Neal, the executive producer and star of VH1's ""Basketball Wives,"" wrote in a commentary for CNN.com in July, ""I'm not a big supporter of the bickering, drink throwing and fighting, but when you put a group of strong, independent and vocal women who are going through or just came out of a bad relationship together, there's bound to be a little drama."" ""More and more people are starting to realize how scripted some of this stuff is,"" Carbone said. ""Not in terms of words, but in unscripted drama. They're not telling people what to say, but they're giving them a situation where they know what's going to arise."" That's exactly what happened when VH1's other reality hit ""Love & Hip Hop"" found Chrissy Lampkin and Kimbella Vanderhee in the same room. What began as a verbal disagreement ended with flying fists and exposed lady parts. ""Viewers like to find a character to dislike,"" McClelland said. ""People like to have sides. Like with 'The Real Housewives of New Jersey' -- Caroline (Manzo) vs. Teresa (Giudice). Fans are into that."" Who could forget Giudice's infamous ""last supper,"" in which she flipped a table over. ""There's over 100 (reality shows) with all of the cable programs,"" Carbone said. ""You almost have to outdo the others to get noticed."" The aggression appears to have amped up recently. A study out of Brigham Young University published in 2010 stated that ""reality-television programs contained high levels of verbal and relational aggression, but almost no physical violence. Such 'meanness' is so frequent, that it is almost expected in reality programs."" And shows like Oxygen's ""Bad Girls Club"" are built around mean girls and fights. These shows clearly have an audience. However, Carbone said, that doesn't mean viewers are desensitized to girl-on-girl violence. If they were, he said, producers would move on to a new attention-grabbing storyline. Which raises a frightening question: What does a show have to do for us to say, ""Oh, we've never seen this on reality TV before""?","Sammi Giancola engaged in a bar fight on Thursday's episode of ""Jersey Shore""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China's third-largest city Guangzhou -- capital of China's richest and most progressive province Guangdong -- has announced it has taken the first concrete steps in unbolting the country's often reviled ""Re-education Through Labor"" (RTL) system. A senior judge told the state-run China Daily that all detainees in the city under the ""laojiao"" or RTL system would be released by the end of the year. ""The police and many legal experts have realized the drawbacks of laojiao and called to abolish the system, which has become outdated,"" Yu Mingyong, deputy president of Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court, was quoted as saying. ""Many of those released from laojiao find many difficulties returning to society, families and work after ... their personal freedom has been restricted in labor camps for several years."" Guangzhou still has about 100 people in labor camps, he said. Human Rights Watch welcomed the move but said there were few RTL camps and detainees in cities. It estimates Guangdong has as many as 18,000 detainees held in a network of facilities throughout the province. Despite the move to end the process -- originally aimed at reforming offenders through a mixture of hard labor and Marxist indoctrination -- HRW claims the changes are merely cosmetic and work camps have simply been relabeled drug detox centers. How it started . Reform Through Labor was set up in the 1950s under Mao Zedong and modeled on the Soviet ""gulags"" -- a place where ""counter-revolutionaries"" and ""class enemies"" could be detained without trial. Millions are believed to have died through overwork, suicide and harsh conditions until the system was overhauled in the 1970s when Deng Xiaoping released prisoners accused of political and religious offenses. According to the latest available figures from the Bureau of Re-education Through Labor under the Ministry of Justice, 160,000 people were held in 350 re-education through labor centers nationwide as of the end of 2008. The UNHCR says the figure is possibly as high as 190,000 people. Today the system empowers police to jail accused offenders -- from petty thieves and prostitutes to drug abusers -- for up to four years without a judicial hearing. Public criticism of the system has grown in China where petitioners against official corruption, ""subversives,"" such as Falun Gong practitioners or those simply finding themselves on the wrong side of powerful Communist Party figures, have also been sentenced to penal labor without trial. In a brief note in the official Nanfang Daily last week, the vice president of Guangzhou City, Yuming Yong, said the city's administrative courts had ceased hearing RTL cases in March, effectively scrapping the system. ""Judicial reform of RTL has been a priority this year,"" Yong told the Nanfang Daily. ""Guangzhou has stopped approval of re-education through labor (cases) further highlighting the protection of citizens' personal liberties."" An administrative tribunal official Xiao Zhixiong added that with no new detention cases being heard, the system would eventually be ""digested out"" but that specific reforms would be a matter for other relevant departments. In January this year, the central government in Beijing strongly hinted that it would begin scrapping the system although Guangzhou's announcement is the strongest indication yet that concrete steps have been taken. Cosmetic changes . While Guangdong province has a reputation for being progressive and reform-oriented, human rights groups are skeptical about the depth of change to the controversial jail system. Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch told CNN that reforms may simply be a cosmetic re-branding of an otherwise repressive system. ""Guangdong is at the vanguard of reform, that's their identity,"" Bequelin said. ""Unfortunately, this 'reform' essentially consists in changing the signboard at the labor camp from 'Re-education Through Labor' to 'Coercive Detoxification Center.'"" He said Guangdong had been ready to move fast because the majority of the RTL detainees in the province -- 10,000 out of a total of 18,000 according to HRW â€” are drug offenders or users who posed little political threat to authorities in Beijing. ""It's not entirely clear to us what has become of the 8,000 RTL detainees who are not being shifted to the detoxification system. Some may have been shifted to yet another system of administrative detention, 'Custody and Education,' designed for people suspected of engaging in sex work or of having hired the services of sex workers,"" Bequelin said. These centers, HRW argues, also constitute arbitrary detention because deprivation of liberty results from administrative, rather than judicial, decisions. ""In other words, no trial, no lawyer, no appeal. And the conditions in these centers are consistently abusive,"" he added. He said that while it was encouraging that local authorities had stopped admitting new detainees while they awaited more concrete reforms from Beijing, the central government could reverse its proposals at any stage. ""As far as Human Rights Watch is concerned, the only way forward is to put a definitive end re-education through labor, not to shift detainees to another arbitrary system of detention, or establish a new system to warehouse minor offenders, petitioners, government critics, sex workers and offenders below the age of 18,"" Bequelin said. Backlash over exposed cases . Two high-profile cases that became public last year generated a massive backlash, forcing the government to address the thorny issue of RTL. In one case, a mother was sentenced to 18 months in a labor camp for ""disrupting social order"" after she repeatedly petitioned officials to execute men convicted of raping her 11-year-old daughter. In another case, a young village official was sent to a labor camp for two years for re-tweeting Weibo posts that were deemed seditious. While even Guangdong's progressive administration has stopped short of attacking the system, saying that it was ""not opposed to the use of coercive power and punishment by public security organs,"" recent official announcements have offered guarded criticism of RTL. ""The system was designed to maintain social order, prevent and reduce crimes by reforming people who committed minor offenses but were not punishable by the penal code,"" read one Xinhua editorial. ""It did play an important role in maintaining social order in specific periods, however, with the development of society and the legal system, its defects have become more and more evident.""

"(CNN) -- Two white Atlanta police officers who pulled over and questioned entertainment mogul Tyler Perry have been exonerated of racial profiling by an internal investigation, according to documents released Tuesday. Just after noon on February 24, Perry left his studio in southwest Atlanta alone in a white Porsche Panamera. As the actor and director later explained in a lengthy Facebook post, Perry made an illegal left turn to make sure he wasn't being followed. Two Atlanta police officers in a patrol car pulled Perry over and questioned him for about six minutes before letting him go without issuing a ticket. Perry described the incident as ""hostile"" and that he felt unsafe. One of the officers continued to ""badger him"" during questioning, the entertainer said. After a four-month investigation, an internal affairs officer reported, ""I would submit the evidence shows the actions of both officers with the regard to the traffic stop of Mr. Perry were justified, lawful and proper."" A representative for Perry said he was unavailable. ""Tyler Perry is out of the country and unable to comment at this time,"" said spokeswoman Keleigh Thomas. Perry: 'We are still being racially profiled' The report said the officers were working for the auto theft task force and one thought Perry's $110,000 sports car was similar to one on a list of stolen cars. The officer said that as he turned around Perry made the illegal turn. One officer, a six-year Atlanta police veteran, told investigators that he didn't stop Perry because he was black. ""His vehicle had dark, tinted windows,"" he said, according to the report. His partner, on the force for eight years, testified that he ""didn't look at the driver"" before the traffic stop. Perry, whose name appears on his license as Emmitt Perry Jr., said on his Facebook post that he explained to the officers that he was trying to make sure he wasn't being followed. One of the officers told investigators he was concerned about Perry's mental state because of his ""actions and body languages."" A black officer who arrived in a second patrol car recognized Perry and asked one of the other officers whether he knew how famous Perry is. Fire at Tyler Perry's studios limited to backlot facade . The car likely wasn't stolen because ""the guy was a billionaire,"" the officer told his colleagues, explaining that Perry made movies. On the recording of the radio traffic that night, one of the two white officers is heard to say, ""I really didn't know who that dude was."" The black officer asked Perry what model year his Porsche was and figured out it was newer than the car police had listed as stolen. The officers said they never intended to issue a traffic ticket but wanted to check the car's identification number. The white officers were admonished for not calling in the traffic stop to a dispatcher. The investigator also said it was debatable as to whether one of the officers should have reached into Perry''s vehicle in an attempt to turn off the engine. The report said that there was no dashboard camera in either patrol car. Police didn't interview Perry personally, but used his Facebook statement as evidence, investigators said.

"(CNN) -- The death toll from an enormous storm system that plowed through the Midwest and spawned more tornadoes as it moved east climbed late Wednesday to 12, authorities said. Three deaths Wednesday evening in Tennessee -- two in Cumberland County and one in DeKalb County -- followed six deaths earlier in Illinois and three in Missouri. It was not clear whether tornadoes were responsible for the Tennessee deaths. Several homes were damaged or destroyed in Cumberland County, and there were reports of downed trees and power lines, according to county emergency officials. There was some good news late Wednesday as the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center downgraded its outlook for severe weather from moderate to slight over the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. It said there was only a 5% probability of tornadoes through Thursday morning. The front at one point stretched 750 miles east to west and 670 miles north to south, said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. It reignited in some areas as it moved into the mid-Atlantic states. The storms first hit before dawn, with an EF4 killer tornado packing 170 mph winds as it smashed Harrisburg, Illinois, killing six. A smaller tornado caused significant damage in the music resort city of Branson, Missouri. Nearly 200 people were hurt across the region, officials said. Two twisters were reported Wednesday night near Hodgenville, Kentucky. Winds in excess of 100 mph were reported in northwestern Alabama. Trees were reported down in Marion County, which was walloped by EF5 tornadoes in the April 2011 storms that pulverized the state. Tourist town of Branson, Missouri, hit . Among the hardest hit cities early Wednesday was Harrisburg, according to the governor's office. The dead included four women and two men. The tornado had a preliminary rating of EF4, the second most powerful on the rating scale, according to the National Weather Service. The twister appeared to have been on the ground for several miles, said Mayor Eric Gregg. The path of destruction was about three or four football fields wide, he said. The scene in the southern part of Harrisburg, in southern Illinois, was one of debris and collapsed houses. Commercial and residential buildings were crushed. A tractor-trailer could be seen laying on its side, off the highway. ""When the sirens were going on this morning ... it was eerily quiet. I had a gut feeling something was wrong,"" Gregg told reporters. ""We will rebuild this city. This will make us stronger,"" Gregg said. There were no reports Wednesday evening of anyone missing, the mayor told CNN's Anderson Cooper. Harrisburg resident Caleb Cattivera said he rushed to his workplace early Wednesday only to find it gone. ""I know a lot of people who live back near there."" Resident Les Winkeler said, ""You just hoped your house didn't come down around you."" His house was still habitable. According to the sheriff's office, some 100 people were injured and between 250 and 300 houses were damaged or destroyed. Among the structures hit was the Harrisburg Medical Center. CEO Vince Ashley told CNN the tornado took out 80 feet of exterior wall, exposing patient rooms, and a significant portion of the roof. See Harper's iReport images . Luckily, hospital staff had enough time to move those patients to the better-protected center of the building before the twister struck, hospital worker Jane Harper said. The emergency room was not damaged, Ashley said, and emergency services were still operating Wednesday evening, although many patients had been moved. Several counties in Kentucky reported storm damage, but no fatalities were immediately reported. At least six counties in the state reported structure damage. The Kentucky National Guard activated 30 soldiers in LaRue County to assist. A shaken and bruised Steven Vaught of Greenville, Kentucky, recounted how he and his two dogs tumbled when his trailer rolled several times down the hill. They all survived. ""It's a joy to be here. I don't know how I'm here,"" Vaught told CNN Nashville affiliate WSMV. ""The good Lord just didn't call me. It wasn't my time."" iReport: Branson Hilton windows blown out . An apparent tornado near Cassville, Missouri, left one person dead, the Barry County Sheriff's Office said. That person was thrown out of a mobile home, the Sheriff's Office said. One death each has been reported in Buffalo and Puxico, Missouri officials said. The country music showcase of Branson also was hit. ""I woke up this morning and looked outside and saw houses were destroyed,"" said Steven Scharmanzer in Branson. ""I've never seen anything like this in the 20 years I've lived here."" Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, who declared a state of emergency, said the damage there was in at least the tens of millions, but there were no reported deaths. ""We are confident that Branson will be back bigger and better than ever,"" Nixon said. An EF2 tornado smashed at least seven miles of the city's commercial strip, leaving 33 people hurt, most with minor to moderate injuries. The city's convention center and an attached Hilton were damaged, as was a portion of Branson Landing, a large shopping and entertainment complex. City Administator Dean Kruithof said about five or six of the city's roughly 40 theaters were damaged. ""We have so many people who want crews in here to clean up, who want to start rebuilding,"" Kruithof said. Tornado in Kansas captured on video . Kansas was hit Tuesday night, and Gov. Sam Brownback declared a state of emergency for the tiny town of Harveyville, about 20 miles southwest of Topeka. Emergency teams combed the community to assess damage after the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado had struck the city. Even when the system didn't spawn tornadoes, it wreaked havoc: The town of Pittsburg, Kansas, experienced straight-line winds up to 120 mph Tuesday, creating a one-mile path of damage that touched upon a motel, power poles and several trees, the weather service said. The number of tornadoes wasn't necessarily higher than normal for this time of year. But it was in densely populated areas, according to CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. Most tornado outbreaks in late winter or early spring generally occur in the southern and central Plains, which are less populated. He said it resulted from warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico colliding with cool Canadian air. Strong upper-level winds that change direction and speed with height (wind shear) created favorable conditions for tornadoes, Morris said. CNN's Logan Burruss, Kara Devlin, Joe Sutton, Josh Levs and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: Severe weather outlook improves for Southeast, mid-Atlantic .

"(CNN) -- The majors have been and gone for another year, but golf has officially entered its most money-spinning phase of the season. As the 2013 campaign reaches its climax an eye-watering $67 million in prize money will be on offer in the four FedEx Cup playoff events. Last year's winner, Brandt Snedeker, picked up over $12.5 million for 16 days' work at tournaments backed by heavyweight sponsors like BMW, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Coca Cola. It reflects an industry battling back from recession, and one that is contributing more than you might think to help boost what is still a fragile economy in the United States -- which has a public debt of almost $17 trillion and rising. The World Golf Foundation's Golf 20/20 report estimates that the industry generated $68.8 billion in goods and services in the U.S. in 2011, with a total economic impact of $176.8 billion. ""The golf industry is larger than the spectator sports and performing arts industries combined,"" WGF chief executive Steve Mona told CNN. ""That's pretty substantial compared to those two. Beyond the monetary contribution it makes, it also employs close to two million Americans with a combined wage income of $55.6 billion. ""What's important about that is when people think about people employed in golf, they generally think about the Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelsons of this world. ""That's true, but they are at the higher end of the scale -- what people don't tend to think about is a lot of the jobs in golf are everyday kind of jobs filled by people who are trying to slug out a living, and feed their family. ""They're working at restaurants, in the grill room, working on the course, taking bags out of your car, cleaning your clubs. Believe me those people are not getting rich, but that is the real backbone of the golf industry."" Golf is nothing if not resilient. The deep recession of 2008 in the United States did not spare the sport, but in recent years it has come out swinging as it moves back towards the $75.9 billion the WGF estimates it generated in 2005. Those figures surely won't be lost on one of golf's biggest fans, who also happens to be the President of the United States. Barack Obama is an avid golfer -- he enjoyed a February round with the world No. 1 Tiger Woods in Florida and spent a good chunk of his recent vacation in Martha's Vineyard on the course. A report released by the Government Accountability Institute in April even suggested Obama has spent more hours on the golf course during his presidency than in economic meetings. Counting the Commander in Chief as one of the game's biggest and most influential supporters can only serve as a great advert for the game, according to Mona. ""There are a couple of things about the President that are really very positive,"" he said. ""One, he's arguably the busiest man in the world with the toughest job in the world, but he can make time to play. He played five times on his recent vacation in Martha's Vineyard. ""That leads to the second point: the fact that he plays it by the rules, and he's enthusiastic about it and tries to play whenever he can, speaks to the magic of the game. ""It can be addicting in a good way and it clearly has been for the President."" As well as counting the most powerful man in America as a golf fan, the game has strengthened its presence on Capitol Hill in recent years. A series of events have been designed to trumpet the growing portion of the economy that golf supports to Washington's power brokers. ""It's important for us to communicate effectively in terms of the impact golf has on the economy generally and the kind of jobs it creates for everyday Americans,"" Mona explains. ""Because when laws and regulations are being made, it's important the golf industry is treated like any other industry of our size and scope. That relates to the second audience we're trying to make sure understands the facts about golf, and that is the influencers of society generally."" However, not all politicians are in love with golf's financial contribution -- a U.S. Congress Senator is seeking to overturn the not-for-profit status enjoyed by the PGA Tour and other sporting bodies such as the NHL and NFL which means they are exempt from federal taxes. Forbes reported in May that of the $130 million the PGA Tour gave to charity last year, most of it went to the WGF -- whose main purpose is to promote golf. ""It's important for golf to have a good reputation in the court of public opinion and not be viewed as a sport for the privileged few played on private clubs by the affluent few,"" Mona said. ""It's not that game at all but it gets perceived sometimes to be that kind of sport."" That point of view might get temporarily sidelined while the game's stars are in the thick of FedEx Cup action. But while the vast sums on offer might turn some of the public off, seeing golf's top players battle it out with such huge prizes at stake is a surefire way to get viewers to turn on. More than 30 PGA tournaments this year offer a winner's purse of greater than $1 million -- by contrast the European Tour lost several events from its calendar this year due to the downturn. And the bigger the prize pot, the more money that drips down through the system, says Mona. ""I think it makes a very strong statement about the health and vitality of the golf industry when you have these world-class brands who want to associate with golf,"" he added. ""They're willing to put up significant sums to be associated with those events, and the players have the opportunity to play for the kind of money reflects very favorably on golf. ""I always say there are two economies in golf. There's the participation economy which is about the everyday golf facilities, trying to attract golfers and current players to play as much they can. ""Then there's the entertainment side of golf too and that's where the professional tours come in. that relates to the interest of the game. ""If we can enhance interest in the game that can lead later down the line to participation. We also know that interest in the game spawns what you're seeing over the next few weeks. ""When people come out to an event itself or tune in on TV, that's why the Barclays of this world affiliate with those events. ""It certainly an indicator of the health of the industry for sure.""","Golf season about to enter playoff season with $67 million in prize money on offer .

"(CNN) -- Many months after his doomsday prediction failed to materialize, a humbled California preacher has admitted his mistake and said he is out of the forecasting game. The Day of Rapture, as predicted by apocalyptic Christian broadcaster Harold Camping, passed without calamity on May 21. Camping's second date, October 21, also came and went without so much as a whimper. The world, it seems, is not doomed. ""We humbly acknowledge we were wrong,"" Camping and his staff members wrote in a letter to supporters posted on the website of Family Radio, Camping's California-based broadcast ministry. He goes further, saying he and his network are no longer interested in predicting when the world will end. Camping had originally said that those selected for salvation would be raptured up to heaven May 21, and those left behind would face months of judgment amid destruction before the world's end October 21. The Family Radio website tweaked the prediction after May 21, saying God had shown mercy by sparing people five months of suffering. But final judgment was still slated to come October 21, when salvation and the world's destruction would happen at once. ""We must also openly acknowledge that we have no new evidence pointing to another date for the end of the world. Though many dates are circulating, Family Radio has no interest in even considering another date. God has humbled us through the events of May 21, to continue to even more fervently search the Scriptures (the Bible), not to find dates, but to be more faithful in our understanding,"" Camping wrote in the letter dated this month. The preacher first inaccurately predicted the world would end in 1994. Despite his poor track record, he has gathered many followers. Some gave up their homes, jobs and life savings because they believed the world was ending.","Christian broadcaster Harold Camping predicted the end of the world would begin May 21 .

""We have lost a real hero tonight, and our hearts are heavy."" Ambelas was one of more than 100 firefighters who responded to the blaze in Brooklyn late Saturday night, the Fire Department of New York said.

Two other firefighters suffered minor injuries. The fire, which broke out on the 19th floor of a 21-floor building, was controlled in about one hour. The fire was determined to be accidental. The electrical cord of an air-conditioning unit where the fire started was ""pinched between a bed frame and the wall,"" according to Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro. Ambelas, who joined FDNY in 2000, was recently promoted to lieutenant. ""I ask every New Yorker to keep Lt. Ambelas in your prayers, keep his family in your thoughts and prayers,"" the mayor said.

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's inflation rate has soared in the past three months and is now at 11.2 million percent, the highest in the world, according to the country's Central Statistical Office. Zimbabwe's inflation rate has soared to a world high. Official figures dated Monday show inflation has surged from the rate of 2.2 million percent recorded in May, despite the government's price controls. The country's finance minister confirmed the new figure in an interview but said the rising inflation rate was not confined to Zimbabwe alone. ""While our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the Western powers, rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of bio-fuel,"" said Samuel Mumbengegwi. ""But we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic."" In February, the price of a loaf of bread in the country was less than 200,000 Zimbabwe dollars. On Monday, that same loaf of bread cost 1.6 trillion Zimbabwe dollars. Analysts have said the Zimbabwean government's official inflation rate figures are conservative. Last week, one of Zimbabwe's leading banks, Kingdom Bank, said the country's inflation rate was now more than 20 million percent. The locally-owned bank predicted tougher times ahead for Zimbabwe in the absence of donor support and foreign investment in an economy that has been in freefall for almost a decade. Once considered the breadbasket of Africa, Zimbabwe has been in the throes of an economic meltdown ever since the country embarked on a chaotic land reform program that has decimated commercial agriculture. Analysts say the crisis has worsened following President Robert Mugabe's disputed reelection in the June 27 presidential run-off. His challenger Morgan Tsvangirai boycotted the race over widespread allegations of violence and voter intimidation. The economic crisis has destroyed Zimbabwe's currency and made it difficult for Zimbabweans to buy basic commodities, electricity, fuel, and medicines. Many Zimbabweans have left the country amid rising unemployment and deepening poverty. Last week a summit in South Africa of regional African leaders failed to persuade Zimbabwe's political parties to agree to form a government of national unity, which observers view as the best way to end Zimbabwe's record recession.","Zimbabwe's inflation rate soars to 11.2 million percent .

"(CNN) -- Libya's government called for calm Tuesday after heavy fighting between local militias around the Libyan coastal city of Zuwara killed at least 17 people and wounded dozens more. The roughly 80 reported wounded filled Zuwara's hospital and included several civilians, said Ayoob Sufyan, a spokesman for the city government. Many of the wounded were severely hurt, and an appeal for blood donations went out on local radio. ""The situation is terrible,"" Sufyan told CNN as sporadi explosions and gunfire echoed in the background. ""It is a real war now."" Sufyan called the violence the worst in that stretch of western Libya since the revolt that toppled longtime Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi in August. Fighting broke out several days ago between factions from Zuwara, a largely Berber city near the Tunisian border, and the nearby Arab-dominated towns of Raghdalin and Jamail. The area has a history of ethnic enmity. Most of Tuesday's deaths were in the outlying towns, but at least seven were reported dead in Zuwara, Sufyan said. Libya's National Transitional Council said it had dispatched a delegation of officials from Tripoli to seek an end to the fighting and a force of government troops to intervene and close off the area. ""The council calls on all Libyans, of all ethnicities, to preserve national unity and to exercise self-restraint, to rise above personal and insignificant differences and to not resort to weapons to resolve unresolved issues,"" the NTC said in a statement issued Tuesday evening. Libyan authorities have been struggling to maintain peace in the country since the revolt that toppled Gadhafi in August. Weapons have flooded Libya's streets, and clashes have raged between rival groups -- including deadly tribal battles in the southern city of Sabha that left nearly 150 people dead last week. The council said it would ""work with all its power and strictly to pursue those who have caused these incidents that aim to destabilize the country."" The latest hostilities started when Zuwara fighters were among a group of more than 60 who were driving back home recently from the Tunisian border where they were posted, Sufyan said. They were intercepted by a large number of armed men, whom Sufyan described as Gadhafi loyalists. He said some of the Zuwara militiamen managed to flee, but 25 others were captured and held for more than two days. Sufyan said the men were severely beaten and tortured by their captors, who called them ""rats"" and ""NATO agents"" -- terms that had been used by the Gadhafi regime to describe rebel fighters. The NTC intervened and secured the release of the militiamen. But after they were freed, clashes broke out Sunday. And that fighting intensified Tuesday, as mortars and rockets rained down on the city. Sufyan said fighters from Zuwara were on the front line fighting back. A Facebook page used by Gadhafi loyalists called ""We Are All Moammar Gadhafi"" is reporting shelling by ""NATO rats"" on Jamail and Raghdalin. Civilian casualties include a mother and her two children whose home in Jamail was shelled. But Sufyan said the people of Zuwara are ""more than friends"" with other Arab cities, like neighboring Zawiya, and blamed the tensions on discrimination by the people of Jamail and Raghdalin. Sufyan complained about what he said were empty promises by the Tripoli government and the National Transitional Council. For months, the government has been promising to disarm the areas surrounding Zuwara after previous incidents, but nothing was done. He said the people of Zuwara feel they have been abandoned because they are Berbers, not Arabs. ""Our people are dying, and they are doing nothing,"" Sufyan said. Col. Ali al-Sheiki, a Ministry of Defense spokesman, told CNN a military committee met Monday to resolve the situation around Zuwara. He said the government will intervene to stop the fighting and work on national reconciliation. If the situation escalates after peaceful intervention, al-Sheiki said, the national army could be deployed to stop the fighting. Al-Sheiki said it was not clear what the cause of the fighting was. He said that despite reports of Jamail and Raghdalin fighters being Gadhafi loyalists, ""It is not 100% confirmed there are former regime elements in the towns.""","NEW: Local officials say 17 dead and dozens wounded .

"(CNN) -- With 56.4 million passengers, Frankfurt was the world's ninth busiest airport in 2011, according to airport trade organization, Airport Council International. But when it comes to animal arrivals and departures, the German gateway takes top billing. More than 100 million animals jetted in and out of Frankfurt's Animal Lounge last year including 2000 horses, 14,000 cats and dogs, 80 million ornamental fish and 300 tons of worms. Run by German carrier Lufthansa, animals range from domestic pets to more exotic specimens destined for zoos and animal reserves, explains Axel Heitman, director of the Animal Lounge. Frankfurt Airport: facts and figures . ""A polar bear was on his way home from the Alps after doing some shooting for some advertising and was really gentle actually,"" Heitman said. ""He had his owner next to him and he took the entire trailer ... and then we had him transported back to Canada."" The 3,750-square meter facility opened its doors in 2008 and is equipped with non-slip floors and climate-controlled chambers to help make an animal's stay as comfortable as possible. A team of 60 trained vets and qualified animal handlers are also on hand round the clock to monitor them when they arrive. Read more: The world's transport gateways . ""When they are in transit, for example, [the staff] would take them out of the kennels and feed them and if they are here overnight, they will walk them around the facility,"" Heitman says. Most animals can travel in the belly of passenger planes, but Lufthansa also has a fleet of 18 freight aircraft which can accommodate all shapes and size of animal -- be it hippopotamuses en route to the Philippines from Israel or rhinos and even crocodiles. There is no such thing as an average day, Heitman says. ""Every day we learn new things because, as you can imagine, there is a huge variety of animals,"" he said.","Frankfurt Airport's Animal Lounge handles more than 100 million animals annually .

"(CNN) -- An 85-year-old American man on an organized tour of North Korea was pulled off a plane in Pyongyang just minutes before it was to depart, the man's son told CNN on Wednesday. The family has had no contact with Merrill Newman of Palo Alto, California, since he was detained on October 26, his son Jeff Newman said. ""This is a misunderstanding. My father is a (Korean War) veteran and wanted to see the country and culture he has been interested in for years,"" Jeff Newman said. ""He arranged this with a travel agent that was recommended and said was approved by the North Korean government for travel of foreigners. He had all the proper visas."" The U.S. State Department is working to resolve the matter with North Korea's top ally, China. Ambassador Glyn Davies, the U.S. special representative for North Korean policy, met with his Chinese counterpart in Beijing for several hours Thursday. ""We are working very hard ... to try to move this issue along,"" Davies said after the session. ""We certainly think that North Korea should think long and hard about (this) and understand that for the United States, this is a matter of core concern for us."" The relationship between North Korea and Washington has been especially testy in recent years as the United States and other world powers have tried to limit the nation's nuclear ambitions. On Tuesday, the State Department warned Americans not to travel to North Korea. Previously, the agency had warned U.S. citizens of the ""serious risks"" of travel to the reclusive country -- including arbitrary arrest for what would be innocuous acts elsewhere. But its last travel warning, issued on October 1, didn't include the stronger language advising against all travel. Newman's arrest appears to be ""an indication that North Korea seems not to be seeking a better relationship with United States,"" Davies said. ""They are not taking action to address our concerns."" Jeff Newman said his family has been working through the State Department since they found out that his father was being held. ""We've worked through the State Department from the day he was supposed to depart,"" Newman said later on CNN's AC360. ""... We've heard nothing."" Newman said what he has heard has primarily come from his father's traveling companion, who was on the plane when he was taken off. He identified the traveling companion as Bob Hamrdla, a friend who lives in the same retirement community. North Korea has not publicly acknowledged it detained Newman. But the family believes the elder Newman's military service during the Korean War may be related to his detention, his son said. Park Syung-je, chairman of the Seoul-based Asia Strategy Institute, says Newman may have been arrested on espionage charges. As a Korean War veteran, Newman might have told his minders he fought against North Korea. They may have reported it, and it resulted in his detention. Pyongyang previously announced that the safety of Americans cannot be guaranteed on North Korean soil. Meeting with authorities . The day before Newman was to leave North Korea, he and his tour guide met with ""one or two Korean authorities,"" his son said. During that meeting, Newman's service record was discussed, he said. ""I understand my dad was a bit bothered,"" Newman said. But neither he nor his traveling companion believed there was an issue. The next day, Newman and Hamrdla boarded a plane for Beijing. Five minutes before the plane was to depart, authorities boarded and asked to see Newman's passport, his son said. According to the traveling companion's account, the authorities then asked the elder Newman to leave the plane with them, Jeff Newman said. When the plane landed, Hamrdla immediately contacted the U.S. Embassy in Beijing to report Newman had been taken off the plane, the younger Newman said. Why do people want to visit North Korea? 'Trip of a lifetime' The elder Newman was enjoying the trip and called home from North Korea to tell his wife about it, his son said. The family also received postcards sent by Newman during the tour of North Korea, he said. The younger Newman called his father ""old school,"" saying he never talked about his service and the Korean War. The trip to North Korean was ""months in the planning,"" the younger Newman said. His father and Hamrdla booked the trip through a Chinese tour company that set up the tour, which included the services of two tour guides. ""It was the trip of a lifetime,"" he said. Other detained Americans . The elder Newman suffers from a heart condition, his son said. Medication was delivered to the North Koreans via Swedish diplomats, but he said he is unsure if the medication made it into his father's hands. ""We would like to know his status. We would like the Swedish Embassy to meet with him to ensure he's getting his medication,"" Jeff Newman said. ""At the end of the day, we'd like him to get on a plane and fly back to San Francisco. He's an 85-year-old man who followed all the protocols. He did everything that he was supposed to do."" Other detentions . Newman is the second American being held in North Korean. Kenneth Bae, an American citizen, was arrested in November 2012 and sentenced in May to 15 years of hard labor. The North Korean government has said he was found guilty of ""hostile acts"" and attempts to topple the government. North Korean authorities have arrested four U.S. citizens for entering the country illegally since January 2009, the State Department said in its travel advisory Tuesday. Two other U.S. citizens who entered the country on valid visas were arrested for other reasons, and U.S. officials have received reports of other Americans being arbitrarily detained, according to the State Department. South Koreans have also been detained. In 1999, a South Korean woman named Min Young-mee was detained for six days after apparently saying the wrong thing on a tour to North Korea's Kumkang Mountains. ""I hope the two Koreas reunite soon so we can visit each other,"" Min said. ""North Korean defectors are living well in the South."" A North Korean minder for the tour group reported her remarks to North Korean authorities. She wasn't allowed to return home with her tour group.

"Washington (CNN) -- The vote was 53-44, and Sen. Barbara Mikulski was on the losing side: Democrats did not have enough votes to advance Senate legislation designed to guarantee women equal pay. ""So I say square your shoulders, put your lipstick on, and let's fight another day,"" the always-colorful Maryland Democrat said. It was one vote in April, and there was never any doubt Democrats would lose. But they held the vote to make a political statement, one many Democratic strategists think is central to the party's chances of improving its midterm election odds. As the Senate was voting, veteran Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg and his Democracy Corps project distributed a memo outlining the stark numbers and what Greenberg insists is an opportunity to improve them by Election Day. The downside, in his view: ""Unmarried women are the key to 2014, but are underperforming now on vote margin and turnout. ... These voters are critical to Democratic fortunes, but they are unlikely to vote, and less likely to give Democrats big margins, if Democrats are not laser-focused on issues that matter most to them."" This ""intensity"" question is paramount. History suggests that key pieces of the Democratic coalition will turn out in lower percentages in this midterm year, including Latinos, African-Americans, younger voters and unmarried women. Then, add in the Republican belief that a focus on President Barack Obama's health care plan helps their 2014 intensity advantage. ""This will be a challenge for Democratic candidates this cycle,"" GOP strategists Elizabeth Harrington and Bill McInturff wrote in a recent memo. ""Voters who say a candidate's position on the law will be a greater factor in determining how they vote are more opposed to the law."" The chart to the left illustrates their point. The question is how much of a factor the health care law will be in your 2014 vote. The challenge for the Democrats, Greenberg and his colleagues argued this week, is to generate new Democratic interest -- and intensity -- around economic issues that he says can be used to increase turnout if framed appropriately. In his surveys, Greenberg finds that 72% of 2012 voters say they are ""almost certain"" to vote in 2014. But only 66% of unmarried women say that. And at the same time their interest in voting is down, Greenberg warns -- as you can see in the chart to the left -- that the unmarried women who are planning to vote in November are not as supportive of the Democrats as they were in 2012 (Though the current 2014 numbers are better than in GOP midterm rout of 2010). Greenberg and his client for this survey -- the Women's Voices Women Vote Action Fund -- assert that Democrats can motivate more women to vote if party candidates push an agenda that includes equal pay, equal treatment by insurance companies and more affordable child care. The Greenberg memo makes frequent references to the opportunity to motivate Democratic voters and change the current midterm dynamics. If they don't, his numbers and charts suggest a tough midterm year, especially when his assessment is matched with the previously cited GOP look at intensity around the health care issue. In addition to unmarried women, Greenberg looks at voting sentiment among a broader group he labels the ""Rising American Electorate"": unmarried women, young voters and people of color. Many ""RAE"" voters are not planning to participate in 2014, and that dropoff is a big GOP advantage. ""Democrats could leave a lot of deciding votes on the table,"" Greenberg argues in urging a sharper and more consistent economic focus. ""Among voters likely to vote in 2014, the generic ballot is tied. Among those who voted n 2012 but who are not likely to vote in 2014, Democrats hold a 16-point margin. This is a big deal."" And, if it doesn't change, a big Republican advantage.","Democratic strategists think equal pay is central to improving midterm odds .
Democrats must focus on issues important to unmarried women, a key bloc .
Democrats' challenge is to increase enthusiasm around economic issues ."
"(CNN) -- A Florida judge revoked bond Friday for George Zimmerman, who is charged with second-degree murder in the death of Trayvon Martin. Seminole County Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester Jr. ordered Zimmerman to surrender to the county sheriff no later than Sunday afternoon. Lester accused Zimmerman of having misrepresented how much money he had when his bond was originally set in April. Prosecutors say he had $135,000 at the time Zimmerman's wife, Shellie, told the court, under oath, that they were indigent. The prosecution cited as evidence recorded telephone conversations that Zimmerman had with his wife prior to the hearing. The conversations were recorded while Zimmerman was being held in the Seminole County Jail after being charged with second-degree murder on April 11. He has pleaded not guilty and has been free on bail. Martin, 17, was fatally shot February 26 while walking in a Sanford, Florida, neighborhood where he was staying during a visit with his father. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, told police he shot the teenager in self-defense. ""The defense, through Mrs. Zimmerman, lied to this court about the amount of money that they had,"" said trial prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda. ""I don't know what words to use other than it was a blatant lie."" Outside the courthouse, a lawyer for the family of Martin said Friday's decision is significant. ""Judge Lester's finding that George Zimmerman was dishonest is very important because his credibility is the most important thing in this entire case,"" Benjamin Crump told reporters. The killing spurred protests among people who criticized police handling of the investigation and said Martin, who was unarmed and carrying a bag of Skittles and an Arizona Iced Tea at the time he was killed, was racially profiled. The teen was African-American; Zimmerman is Hispanic. In court documents, State Attorney Angela B. Corey also said that Zimmerman had two passports, and the passport that he surrendered to the court at the April hearing was one that Zimmerman had reported stolen on March 8, 2004. That passport was valid until May 2012, Corey said. Zimmerman was issued a second passport on March 26, 2004, and that one is valid until 2014, she said. The prosecutor asked the court that Zimmerman be ordered to surrender the second passport to authorities. But Lester appeared to accept the explanation from Zimmerman's lawyer that his client had given him the second passport, and the lawyer simply forgot to hand it over to authorities until Friday. Regarding Zimmerman's finances, Corey alleged that in the recorded phone calls in April the couple ""spoke in code to hide what they were doing"" regarding the money in a credit union account belonging to the couple. The money was apparently donated by members of the public to Zimmerman's website. Zimmerman ""fully controlled and participated in the transfer of money from the PayPal account to defendant and his wife's credit union accounts,"" Corey said in court records. ""This occurred prior to the time defendant was arguing to the court that he was indigent and his wife had no money."" In late April, Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, said that the money raised by the website was put into a trust account that the attorney controls. But Corey stated Friday in the court documents: ""The money still belongs to defendant and he can demand it at any time."" Court papers provided a partial transcript of a phone call allegedly showing the code used by Zimmerman and his wife on April 16: . Zimmerman: ""In my account do I have at least $100?"" His wife: ""No."" Zimmerman: ""How close am I?"" His wife: ""$8. $8.60."" Zimmerman: ""Really. So total everything how much are we looking at?"" His wife: ""Like $155."" The prosecutor said the judge ""relied on false representations and statements"" by Zimmerman and his wife when the court set his bond at $150,000. He was required to post only 10% of that. Corey argued that the court should revoke the bond or increase it ""substantially."" Lester appeared angry that the court had not been told about the money. ""Does your client get to sit there like a potted palm and let you lead me down the primrose path?"" he asked Zimmerman's lawyer. ""That's the issue."" O'Mara told CNN on Friday night that he had discussed the judge's decision with Zimmerman, who was not in court on Friday. ""He's frustrated because he now has to come out of hiding,"" O'Mara told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""You need to realize we're still talking about a 28-year-old who's being charged with a crime he does not believe he committed, and his whole life has been turned upside down, so I think that it all needs to be kept in context."" O'Mara added that he hoped the judge's revocation of bond would be temporary. ""We're going to have a conversation with the judge to try to explain it away. Hopefully, that will be worthwhile and we're going to get back out on bond."" Meanwhile, Zimmerman's defense team and prosecutors were both on the same side in court Friday afternoon fighting media companies' request to release more information in the case. Prosecution and defense lawyers argued that a host of material should remain sealed. Opinion: Shooting wasn't a case of racial profiling . The intense public attention on the case is a chief reason certain information should remain out of the public eye, de la Rionda said in a motion filed earlier this month. He argued that releasing too much ""will result in this matter being tried in the press rather than in court, and an inability to seat a fair and impartial jury in Seminole County."" De la Rionda also voiced worries about witnesses being ""reluctant to testify"" for fear that their privacy would be violated and other witnesses being ""harassed by media representatives."" Specifically, the state wants the names and addresses of witnesses kept out of the public record. It asks for the same for crime scene and autopsy photos, a 911 recording of the incident, and cell phone records of Martin, Zimmerman and one witness. De la Rionda is also requesting a judge seal statements Zimmerman made to law enforcement officers, some of which may be used against him at trial because they were ""inconsistent with the physical evidence and statements of witnesses."" New documents shed light on Martin killing . O'Mara filed his own motion agreeing with the prosecution's desire not to release material. He said the defense wants 1,000 e-mails received by Sanford police to be sealed, plus statements by Zimmerman. He asked that text messages, e-mail messages or journals made by the defendant be kept private, at least until they can be reviewed. Scott Ponce of the Miami-based law firm Holland & Knight argued for more disclosure on behalf of various newspapers, TV stations and their parent companies. The opposing arguments were laid out in motions filed in advance of Friday's hearing. This week, Ponce filed responses to the prosecution and defense positions, addressing them point by point. ""The broad secrecy the state seeks ... is not supported by statute, constitution or case law, and it certainly cannot be justified in this prosecution,"" he said. Ponce argued that civilian witnesses' names and addresses cannot be sealed under Florida's public records law, because they would not be ""defamatory"" or ""jeopardize the safety"" of a witness. He said the state hasn't proven anyone is in jeopardy. The contested cell phone records may be reviewed and, if need be, have parts redacted, but they shouldn't be withheld entirely, he said. Ponce said Zimmerman's statements to police should not be treated as ""confessions,"" which would not be made public before trial. The judge expressed sympathy for the prosecution and defense attorneys but said, ""The law is against us."" He noted that the law in Florida ""favors full, complete, open disclosure."" Lester said he would review the discovery request and release material ""in a redacted fashion."" HLN's Josey Crews, CNN's Michael Martinez and InSession's Nancy Leung contributed to this report.","Zimmerman is ordered to surrender within 48 hours .

"(CNN) -- Sensible immigration reform will strengthen American society and economy. But it must also respect the rights of U.S. citizens and those aspiring to join them. Buried in the comprehensive immigration reform legislation before the Senate are obscure provisions that impose on Americans expansive national identification systems, tied to electronic verification schemes. Under the guise of ""reform,"" these trample fundamental rights and freedoms. Requirements in Senate Bill 744 for mandatory worker IDs and electronic verification remove the right of citizens to take employment and ""give"" it back as a privilege only when proper proof is presented and the government agrees. Such systems are inimical to a free society and are costly to the economy and treasury. Any citizen wanting to take a job would face the regulation that his or her digitized high-resolution passport or driver's license photo be collected and stored centrally in a Department of Homeland Security Citizenship and Immigration Services database. The pictures in the national database would then need to be matched against the job applicant's government-issued ""enhanced"" ID card, using a Homeland Security-mandated facial-recognition ""photo tool."" Only when those systems worked perfectly could the new hire take the job. Immigrant employees would probably have to get biometric (based on body measurements like fingerprint scans and digital images) worker ID cards. Social Security cards may soon become biometric as well. Any citizen or immigrant whose digital image in the Homeland Security databank did not match the one embedded in their government-issued ID would be without a job and benefits. Yet, citizens have a constitutional right to take employment. Since the Butchers Union Co. decision in 1884, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that ""the right to follow any of the common occupations of life is an inalienable right ... under the phrase 'pursuit of happiness.' "" This right is a large ingredient in the civil liberties of each citizen. The digital ID requirements in S. 744 eliminate that fundamental right to take employment and transform it into a privilege. This constitutional guarantee could in effect be taken away by bureaucratic rules or deleted by a database mistake. As philosopher John Locke, whose phrase ""consent of the governed"" animates the Declaration of Independence, once said, everybody ""has a property in his own person."" Who is a citizen is today determined by his or her American personhood. Under S. 744, that would no longer be true. Instead, the determination of whether someone has a right to take a job would be made by two computer files: one in a Department of Homeland Security database and the other on a government-issued ID card. Identity and IDs become ""property of the U.S. government."" Moreover, S. 744 undermines constitutional federalism by resurrecting ID provisions that most states have rejected. Not only does S. 744 mandate ""E-Verify"" as a national electronic verification system for employment for the 33 states that have not joined it (Illinois actually outlawed its use), the bill also revives the moribund ""Real ID"" requirement for sharing of driver's license photos among the states and federal government, which 25 states opposed by law or resolution. Only 13 states joined as of last year. In short, S. 744 gets around states' repeated rejections of national identification systems by lumping E-Verify and Real ID into overly comprehensive national identification (rather than immigration) ""reform."" S. 744's provisions also mandate collection of the details about almost every American, an enumeration task the Constitution authorizes only to the census every 10 years, and then only under a 72-year guarantee of confidentiality. Moreover, though the search for religious freedom created this country and begins the Bill of Rights, S. 744 removes the religious accommodations that 20 states offer in the form of driver's licenses without photographs for reasons of religious faith. These follow the Supreme Court's upholding of a Nebraska woman of Christian faith's observance of the Second Commandment prohibition against images (other religions may also qualify). If mandatory digital photos and biometric IDs are forced on religious believers, many are convinced that they will face eternal condemnation. E-Verify essentially equates all Americans with ""illegal immigrants."" Instead of naturalization freeing legal immigrants from carrying mandatory ""green cards,"" universal E-Verify would impose IDs on American citizens. E-Verify effectively creates a ""no-work"" list for the unverifiable. Uses of worker IDs will proliferate like Social Security numbers -- once intended ""not for identification purposes"" -- and driver's licenses -- once simply proving driving skill. Worker IDs could become ""travel licenses"" for ""official purposes,"" as defined by the secretary of Homeland Security, like entering government buildings, flying (still possible now without ID) or taking public transit. These undermine the rights to petition government and to travel. Even though the bill says it does not authorize a national ID, its provisions do. Digital photos in the Homeland Security databank can be used to match anyone anywhere using facial recognition surveillance technology. Because the standards are cross-national and the U.S. exchanges information with other governments and global organizations, the digital photos will probably be shared with foreign and international intelligence and police agencies. Moreover, the recent revelations of IRS and National Security Agency excesses raise the question of universal E-Verify as the foundation for a central surveillance system of storing and tracking job, tax, communication and biometric information on individuals. This shifts too much power to the government and away from citizens. Worker ID systems will burden individuals and businesses with large expenses. Many Americans without driver's licenses will lose work time traveling to vital records offices for birth or marriage certificates or to motor vehicle agencies for state IDs to become eligible to be E-Verified. The large costs some people pay will include the inability to work because they cannot get proper documentation. A comprehensive worker ID system will cost taxpayers and businesses, big and small, billions for the time and ""photo tool"" equipment needed to implement such a system to E-Verify the entire labor force. Universal E-Verify might also push employers and employees toward the black market, encouraging the hiring of workers off the books. It could cost employers and employees more than $6 billion and reduce tax revenues by $17 billion a decade. As one immigration-policy expert was quoted saying in the Wall Street Journal, a biometric E-Verify system is ""not only a gross violation of individual privacy, it's an enormously high-cost policy that will have an incredibly low to negligible benefit."" Even sponsors of the bill have noted that biometric tracking systems are inordinately expensive and ""have experienced problems in test runs."" If E-Verifying costs $150 per employee, only a third (37%) of Americans say in polls that they would support using the system. The existing E-Verify is infamous for database errors that kept tens of thousands of citizens out of work and in limbo. Nationwide E-Verify could raise that number many-fold. A 1% error rate for a labor force of more than 150 million workers, with the vast majority being American citizens, leaves 1.5 million unemployed. These ID provisions divert attention and resources from effective and comprehensive policy measures to legalize more immigrants, workers and workplaces. Together, good public policy combinations can let people enter and leave by the ""front door"" and jointly reduce the pressures for overemphasis on border security and the excuses for invasive and unconstitutional ID and verification systems. Moreover, these complement simpler and less invasive alternatives to E-Verify, such as longstanding provisions for citizen attestation of their rights. And others can ""answer questions about previous addresses or other details."" These can be implemented inexpensively on forms kept at the workplace. Protecting the constitutional right to employment of a diversity of citizens helps everyone who wants to contribute to prosperity and to become American by maintaining citizenship as the bedrock of freedoms. Our citizenship must remain the gold standard, rather than a tarnished dream, for both current Americans and those seeking to enter here. Our leaders have to hear that E-Verify, digital IDs and databanks, and biometric worker cards need to be dropped fast. Increased legal immigration, reasonable legalization, fair work standards enforcement and viable guest worker options can sustain citizenship and employment rights fairly and without exorbitant costs. And we do not want biometric worker IDs or digital ""Big Brother"" verification schemes that trample on the basic rights of American citizens and those working to join us.

"Rome (CNN) -- Pope Francis is creating a commission to prevent the abuse of minors and to support victims of abuse, Cardinal Sean Patrick O'Malley announced Thursday in Rome. The new commission is expected to tell church officials to collaborate with civil authorities and report cases of abuse, O'Malley said. But he also said that the church has focused on the judicial aspect of sexual abuse in the past, and that Pope Francis now wants to focus on the pastoral side, and caring for victims. The Pope has not yet chosen the members of the new commission but it will be international in composition and include experts, O'Malley added. The eight-member Council of Cardinal Advisers, which has been in Rome since Monday meeting with the Pope, proposed the special commission and the Pope accepted it, O'Malley said. The cardinals, who come from around the world, are helping the Pope with Vatican reform. The Vatican news service released a statement outlining the commission's lines of action, including a look at guidelines, priest ""formation"" programs, codes of conduct, and screening candidates for priesthood. No timetable for the establishment of the panel was given. Pope Francis calls for big changes in Roman Catholic Church . Awaiting Pope's response . Observers have been awaiting Pope Francis' response to a scandal that has generated deep mistrust in the church and driven many Catholics away from the faith, particularly in the United States. At a meeting with Dutch bishops earlier this week, the Pope spoke of the victims. ""I want to express my compassion and to ensure my prayers to all victims of sexual abuse and their families,"" he said, according to the Vatican news service. However SNAP -- the U.S.-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests -- said the creation of ""another commission surveying bishops and recommending policies is meaningless."" ""It's like offering a Band-Aid to an advanced cancer patient,"" SNAP said in a statement . ""Only decisive action helps, not more studies and committees and promises. ... Clergy sex crimes should be dealt with by secular authorities."" In July, Pope Francis announced a law making it a crime to abuse children sexually or physically on Vatican grounds. The acts were already crimes under church law, but are now specifically outlawed within the Vatican city-state, which is home to hundreds of people. The legislation also covers child prostitution and the creation or possession of child pornography. ACLU, Michigan woman sue Catholic Bishops over hospital rules .

McDaniel narrowly edged Cochran in a June 3 primary, but with neither man cracking the 50% threshold needed to win, the contest moved to the runoff three weeks later, which Cochran won by fewer than 7,000 votes. His victory was aided by votes from African-American Democrats, who were actively courted during the runoff by Cochran's campaign and allied groups. According to Mississippi law, voters are not required to register with a political party, and anyone who doesn't vote in a primary election can cast a ballot in either party's runoff. Since the runoff, McDaniel has refused to concede and has repeatedly vowed to use every legal maneuver available to fight the results. McDaniel alleges that some Democrats who voted in the runoff had previously cast a ballot in their party's Senate primary. ""Right now, we have found we have found more than 5,000 irregularities. There are more than 19,000 absentee ballots we still haven't seen yet,"" McDaniel told CNN. Disputed claims . The Cochran campaign disputes McDaniel's claims, and numbers. ""The time has come now for the McDaniel campaign to put up or shut up. If they have hard evidence, bring it forward. But quit talking about exaggerated numbers that they know are not true,"" Cochran campaign spokesman and adviser Austin Barbour said Wednesday. After last week's runoff, McDaniel's campaign dispatched volunteers across Mississippi to investigate the results in the state's 82 counties. FreedomWorks, one of the anti-establishment groups that's been supporting McDaniel, dispatched activists to assist the campaign. Separately, a conservative outside group filed a lawsuit in federal court asking for full access to the voting records in the primary and runoff elections. Won't drag out . McDaniel said on ""New Day"" that the process ""won't drag out too much longer. We have our people in the field. They'll be working all next week to find the additional irregularities that we believe are out there."" McDaniel added that ""after that, we'll have our evidence together and move forward."" And he defended his campaign's use of reward money, ""if fraud was committed."" He added, ""If vote buying took place as alleged, we have an obligation to find it and root it out once and for all. There's nothing wrong with that process. It needs to happen for the integrity of the election process."" McDaniel pushed back allegations that he's contesting the runoff results to further his political career and pay off campaign debts. ""We don't have any primary debt, not one dime,"" McDaniel told Bolduan, adding that what he's now doing is ""bigger than a campaign, it's bigger than a candidate, it's bigger than me."" 'Join us in the process' And he urged the Cochran campaign to ""join us in this process. Why not go out there hand and hand and lets find the corruption if it exists."" But that offer didn't fly with the Cochran camp. ""It's obvious that Chris McDaniel doesn't care about the integrity of the process or he wouldn't be offering thousand-dollar bounties in e-mail fundraising blasts and flat out stating that the election was stolen and the election was a sham without any proof,"" Cochran spokesman Jordan Russell told CNN. ""So I think he needs to spare me the 'why won't they join us in protecting the integrity of the process.' Chris McDaniel doesn't care anything about the integrity of the process. Chris McDaniel cares about staying in the spotlight."" McDaniel condemns race comments . On Wednesday's Cochran campaign conference call, a person who appeared to be a McDaniel supporter asked ""since black people harvested cotton, why is it OK to harvest their votes? Why is it OK to harvest the votes of black people?"" Asked about those comments, McDaniel said ""we condemn any racist comments what so ever. But bear in mind, we have no idea who that person is."" He added, ""You understand there are people out there we have no control over."" If his legal challenge to the runoff results is turned down by the courts, McDaniel told CNN that ""certainly we'll respect the court's decisions. As to endorsing or going forward with Thad Cochran or whoever else, I'm going to have to make that call after all this is said and done."" 5 controversial moments in the Mississippi election .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China has banned advertisements for luxury products on its official state radio and television channels. The move is an apparent attempt to douse growing social frustration in the wealth gap between the country's rich and poor -- and to stop corruption conducted through luxury gift-giving. Such ads had ""publicized incorrect values and helped create a bad social ethos,"" said China's television watchdog, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT), reported Xinhua, the country's official state-run news agency. The ban includes commercials for high-end watches, gold coins and rare stamps and comes on the eve of China's Lunar New Year celebrations that begin this weekend. The holiday, compared to Christmas in the West, is a time of intense gift- and money-giving. Share prices of Burberry, LVMH, Richemont and Chow Tai Fook, the world's largest jewelry marker, all fell after Beijing announced the ban. In 2012, China surpassed Japan as the world's largest luxury market. By 2015, McKinsey & Co. had predicted China's luxury market would account for one-fifth of global sales with a value of $27 billion. Beijing's luxury ad ban may now dampen growth in the market. China's latest move follows a series of recent statements and decisions from top leaders exhorting Communist party officials to lead a low-key lifestyle to avoid imagery of a leadership out of touch with many of its citizens. Last November, as Chinese President Hu Jintao prepared to begin the power transition to his successor Xi Jinping, Hu cautioned that failing to stop corruption could result in the demise of the Communist party. In December, new party rules announced that ornate flower displays, waving schoolchildren welcoming visiting dignitaries and large groups of state officials traveling abroad were prohibited or frowned upon. China's Central Military Commission also banned luxury banquets for military forces and alcohol at official functions. In January, China's National Bureau of Statistics released an official Gini coefficient reading for the first time in ten years. The figure that measures a country's rich-poor divide was 0.474. A separate survey from December 2012 by China's Southwestern University revealed the country's 2010 Gini coefficient was 0.61. A number over 0.40 indicates potential for social unrest, according to the United Nations.","China's luxury ad ban targets country's widening wealth disparity .

"(CNN) -- Teachers and parents share a common purpose: educating children. But differing beliefs, expectations and methods can make collaboration more challenging. A 2011 story published on CNN.com by author and teacher Ron Clark, entitled ""What teachers really want to tell parents,"" looked at reasons why educators give up on their field. He asserted that negativity from parents places undue pressure on teachers and advised greater cooperation. ""We are educators, not nannies,"" Clark wrote. ""We are educated professionals who work with kids every day and often see your child in a different light than you do. If we give you advice, don't fight it."" His opinion consistently resonated with readers over the next couple of years, which made it one of CNN's most-shared stories on Facebook. The story has been recommended more than 898,000 times. Clark founded the Ron Clark Academy in Atlanta and was named ""American Teacher of the Year"" by Disney and a ""Phenomenal Man"" by Oprah Winfrey. But even Clark's status as a leader in his field didn't fully explain why this story captivated people, so CNN revisited the idea with Facebook users last week by asking them to finish this sentence: ""The one thing parents/teachers really need to know is _____."" Readers responded enthusiastically with more than 750 thoughtful posts. Their answers revealed stewing frustrations from teachers and parents alike. A few teachers described parents who seem like they aren't doing enough to help their children. Parents chimed in, too, with some saying teachers should use different strategies to reach students. The comments from the two groups created a spirited discussion that resembled a virtual parent/teacher conference. The exchange coincides with the time of year when many classrooms are having such meetings. Several respondents indicated a need for cooperation, with teachers and parents as allies. ""Parents need to know we're in it for the kids; obviously not for the money,"" said Facebook user and Florida teacher Cindy Hoffman. ""We're in a partnership, trying to do the best for the children as possible. Please don't treat us as adversaries."" Some parents expressed a desire for greater connection with schools. ""Teachers need to know that some parents do care and want to be involved,"" wrote Dana Fabrocini Dentino. ""Also, the kids who do their work and are well behaved -- they need some attention, too."" And some readers, like Tiffany Jean Williams-Solod, can relate to both worlds. ""As a parent, teachers, I want my child challenged every single day, and if she doesn't get it, tell me so I can assist you,"" she wrote. ""Don't be afraid to tell me if my child disrespects you."" She, too, joined the many impassioned cries for greater cooperation. ""As a teacher (oh yes, I am both) I want parents to stop blaming teachers and start working with us,"" Williams-Solod said. ""We can't fix everything, but remember we are humans and we aren't perfect. Also, teach your kids to respect us.""

"Editor's Note: Oscar-winning actor Javier Bardem produced a documentary, ""Invisibles,"" on suffering in the Congo and four other regions of the world. John Prendergast is co-chair of the Enough Project, an initiative to end genocide and other crimes against humanity. Prendergast was director of African affairs at the National Security Council and special adviser at the Department of State during the second Clinton term. He has written eight books on Africa. Javier Bardem produced a film on suffering in Congo and four other regions of the world. (CNN) -- Over the past decade, waves of violence have continuously crashed over eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in the world's deadliest war. A study by the International Rescue Committee says the war has led to the deaths of 5.4 million people. The human wreckage that washes ashore in displaced settlements and shattered communities has few parallels in terms of pure suffering. With the most recent escalation in the conflict during September and October, another tidal wave of destruction is hitting the embattled population of eastern Congo, with devastating consequences. The perpetrators and orchestrators of this violence do so primarily in a mad scramble for one of the richest non-petroleum natural resource bases in the world. All kinds of minerals are mined in the Congo that end up in our computers, cell phones, jewelry, and other luxury and essential items of everyday use. Because there is no rule of law in the Congolese war zone and no ethical code impacting the international supply and demand for these minerals, the result is that anything goes. In Congo, this means the vampires are in charge. Vampires take many forms in Congo. They are the militia leaders who control the mines, and who use mass rape as a means of intimidating local populations and driving people away from areas they want to control. Watch rape victim tell her story » . Vampires also include some of the middlemen based in neighboring countries who arrange for the purchase and resale of Congo's resources to international business interests, run by people who are often accomplices. They need to acquire minerals like tin and coltan to be able to satisfy the insatiable demand for these products in North America, Europe and Asia. It leads them to ask no questions about how the minerals end up in their hands. Then there are innocent consumers like us -- completely unaware that our purchases of cell phones, computers and other products are helping fuel a shockingly deadly war halfway around the world, not comprehending that our standard of living is in some ways based on the suffering of others. The suffering of the people of the Congo is unnecessary. If there was a functioning government there, and the rule of law, the minerals could be mined in a legal and orderly way. If there was a peace agreement involving the main armed groups, the use of sexual violence as a tool of war would end. If there was a cost for committing the kinds of atrocities that have become common in Congo, they would end. There are many Congolese community leaders, churches, politicians, human rights activists, women's organizations and others who are struggling to create a future Congo that is defined by peace and security. Around the world, we can play a major role in supporting these everyday heroes. The Enough Project is launching a campaign called RAISE Hope for Congo, aiming to build a permanent and diverse constituency of activists who will advocate for the protection and empowerment of Congolese women and girls. Women and girls have become primary targets in the war of attrition between the armed groups in eastern Congo. Congo's transformation must begin with them. Over a century ago, tens of thousands of people across the world joined together in what would be the 20th century's first great international human rights movement to protest the bloody reign of Belgium's King Leopold II over the Congo. In a murderous effort to exploit the central African nation's vast natural resources, half of the Congo's population would be decimated by King Leopold's personal rule -- an estimated 8 million people. The resulting public outcry helped curb the worst abuses of that period. A century later, the people of the Congo need a new popular movement to end the atrocities once and for all. So, the good news is there are answers to what is happening in Congo. A determined peace process can end the war. Support for Congolese institutions can help build the rule of law and economic opportunities. And a focus on crimes against women by the International Criminal Court could help introduce some accountability and justice to a place that has little. But these things won't happen unless voices are raised all over the world against the injustice occurring in the Congo. If we make enough noise, we can influence politicians to pay a little more attention to the deadliest war in the world. With a little attention and some effective action, that war could end, and the era of vampire rule in eastern Congo would come to an end. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Javier Bardem and John Prendergast.","Bardem, Prendergast: Congo has had 10 years of war and suffering .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan officials sounded an alarm Saturday over NATO bombings of three ports that they said would trigger a crisis by limiting the movement of supply ships carrying critical supplies in and out of the war-torn nation. NATO jets destroyed eight Libyan warships in the ports of Tripoli, Al-Khums and Sirte after concluding that Col. Moammar Gadhafi had started using naval assets to lay mines and hamper international humanitarian aid, said Mike Bracken, NATO's military spokesman. Libyan officials said, however, that the airstrikes violated the United Nations resolution mandating the protection of civilians. Amran al-Forjani, Libya's chief coastguard commandant, called the operation a ""crazy attack."" No deaths or injuries were reported. Bracken said at a Friday news conference that the NATO strikes were justified. Gadhafi was indiscriminately mining waters in Misrata and hampering the flow of humanitarian aid, Bracken said. ""He was using maritime forces to lay mines. These were legal targets,"" he said. NATO warplanes have been pounding military targets since March after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution to protect civilians by any means necessary as Gadhafi's forces try to quash a nearly three-month revolt against Gadhafi's nearly 42 years of rule. NATO and human rights groups said Libyan forces have targeted aid ships coming in and out of Misrata, where a bloody see-saw battle has raged between Gadhafi's forces and the rebels. But the coast guard commandant denied that his vessels were used to attack Misrata or any other Libyan city. A Libyan official who led CNN personnel on a tour of the area Friday said the commercial port, not the nearby military port, was hit. From the distance at which CNN was allowed to view the area, it was not clear what sort of vessels were hit. Six rockets struck in three strikes that hit five coast guard boats and one navy vessel in dock for maintenance, said Mohammed Ahmed Rashed, the port general manager. The port remained operational, according to officials, but the strikes would impact the limited movement of supply ships. Libyan officials said the port is the main food and fuel supply line, and they expect the strikes to deter freight ships from coming because of security concerns and to increase the insurance on ships and goods. In another development, the European Union will open an office in Benghazi on Sunday, officials said. Catherine Ashton, foreign policy chief of the European Union, will open the office, said the National Transitional Council, which is based in the city. The council, in a statement, quoted Ashton as saying,  ""It will be an honor to meet the people who have been fighting for democracy and a better future for Libya. I plan to meet key people from the National Transitional Council, civil society groups and our international partners, and will report back to EU Foreign Ministers on Monday. Opening an EU office is an important signal of our unfaltering support for the Libyan people. It is the EU putting words into action."" Also Saturday, Libyan rebels released four French nationals detained in Benghazi since May 11. The four traveled to Egypt on Saturday, where they were taken in by French consular authorities, the  French Foreign Ministry said. And in western Libya, a government bus carrying three foreigners working for international media organizations -- Phoenix TV, BBC and Reuters -- was attacked by an angry mob in Zawiya. The journalists were on their way to the Tunisian border. They escaped unharmed. Yijun Zhou, a reporter for Hong Kong-based Phoenix TV, said an angry crowd of dozens surrounded the bus and a man with a knife slashed the tires of the bus, kicked in the doors and climbed aboard followed by five more men. Reuters producer Guy Desmond, who was also on the bus, said at least two of the attackers had pistols and one had a knife. They shouted at the journalists, demanding to know their nationalities and employers.The journalists were taken to a police station for two hours before they returned to Tripoli to get another bus back to the border. Meanwhile, pro-Gadhafi forces have unleashed their biggest attack yet against a rebel stronghold in the mountains of western Libya, one of the Libyan leader's former generals said. As of Friday night, one rebel was dead and three were wounded, one of them critically, the former commander said. He now commands rebels in Zintan, using the name Hajj Usama. The attack began Thursday when about 150 of Gadhafi's infantry troops began firing on three fronts near Zintan, about 90 miles southwest of the capital, Tripoli. In response, Usama said he dispatched hundreds of fighters to cut off Gadhafi's advance. CNN's Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","NEW: European Union to open Benghazi office Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Georgia Tugend awoke Sunday with a sense of relief. Hurricane Irene had roared through her Delaware neighborhood, vast and menacing. The wind knocked out power and scattered debris. Her house did not flood, though. Her family was safe. ""It was not as bad as I feared it would be,"" Tugend said. ""There's nothing I see that can't be fixed with a little elbow grease."" Irene left more than 4 million homes and businesses in the dark up and down the East Coast, and authorities blamed it for the deaths of at least 18 people in seven states. They said it caused at least $1 billion in damage and warned that floods could cause more chaos. Yet a cautious sense emerged Sunday that the nation had been spared an even more damaging blow from the storm. President Barack Obama had warned last week that Irene could be a ""hurricane of historic proportions."" Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey warned that ""from a flooding perspective, this could be a 100-year event."" On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said that Tropical Storm Irene remains ""large and potentially dangerous"" as it moves inland. ""By and large, with the evacuations and other actions taken, we have dramatically decreased the risk to life over the course of the storm,"" she said. Forecasters and government officials warned people for days to take Irene seriously. As the storm clouds neared, New York City took the unprecedented step of ordering 370,000 people to evacuate. Airlines canceled thousands of flights. Five airports in and around New York City closed, as did the Philadelphia airport. Mass-transit systems closed in Baltimore, Boston, New York, Philadelphia and parts of New Jersey. After the storm moved north, however, people in places such as Ocean City, Maryland, were thankful that Irene had not left behind as much devastation as it could have. ""It was a long night last night, but I can tell you, we dodged a missile here at Ocean City,"" Mayor Rick Meehan said. In New Jersey, Christie praised roughly a million people who heeded warnings to evacuate the Jersey Shore. People ""decided we're not going to be tough and cynical and hard-boiled"" and played it safe instead, he said. Christie acknowledged taking lessons from past disasters. Some criticized him for being away during a blizzard in New Jersey last year. And the federal government received withering criticism for its response to Hurricane Katrina, which killed more than 1,700 people in seven states after coming ashore on the Gulf Coast as a Category 3 hurricane in August 2005. ""I think we took a lot of lessons from every one of these different disasters,"" Christie said. People in Washington, D.C., also ventured out Sunday to discover that the city could have fared much worse. ""I drove around and there were a lot of downed trees, but other than that, it wasn't that bad,"" said Eric Goode. ""It was a bit of a let down,"" said another resident, Samantha Kaplan. In New York, the unexpected sight of the shining sun buoyed a sense that the city had escaped the kind of problems that forecasters had most feared. Those fears prompted authorities to close the city's mass-transit system and order people in low-lying areas to evacuate. On Sunday, though, some people asked if the danger was over-hyped. ""A bunch of people in New York have already said to me this morning, you know, 'What was the big deal all about?"" CNN's Anderson Cooper said. ""There was so much expectation about, and fear about, what might happen in New York City,"" he said. ""We've seen, it seems like, the best possible outcome so far. Yes, we've seen some flooding in some areas -- in New York, I'm talking about, but certainly not as extensive as had been feared."" Cooper asked CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers what had become of the dire forecasts that envisioned gleaming office buildings swaying as flood waters spilled into lower Manhattan. Myers said that when Hurricane Irene smashed into the Outer Banks of North Carolina, that contact weakened the storm. ""It literally knocked the stuffing out of the eye,"" Myers said. ""It never got its mojo back."" Meteorologists measured pressure levels inside the storm that could have allowed it to strengthen back into a Category 3 hurricane, Myers said, but Irene's romp over land in North Carolina prevented the eye wall from spinning into a more destructive storm by the time it arrived in New York. ""It never had that opportunity because North Carolina got in the way, dry air came across over Virginia and Maryland and got in the way, and although this was very low pressure, the reason why we could never let the guard down for New York City ... was because the pressure was low enough that at any time, if this storm decided to get its act together, it could have gone from a 60-70-80 miles per hour storm -- it easily could have been a 110 (miles per hour) storm like it was in the Caribbean and like it was in the Bahamas."" Joseph Bruno, New York City's commissioner of emergency management, agreed that it could have been worse. ""We've gotten some benefit from Mother Nature,"" he told CNN. ""We did well. We prepared well also."" He thanked people for heeding Mayor Michael Bloomberg's order to evacuate, which authorities lifted at 3 p.m. Sunday. Not everyone followed local authorities' evacuation orders, however. In Lewes, Delaware, about three miles from the Atlantic Ocean, Tugend ignored a mandatory evacuation order because, she said, she could think of no safer place than her home to escape the storm's fury. As the storm neared, she rounded up candles and matches, put fresh batteries in the flashlights and huddled with her husband, Dave Fiscbach, and their dog, Barkley, a Chesapeake Bay retriever named for basketball star Charles Barkley. They lost power around dusk on Saturday, but propane fuels her stovetop. She boiled water for spaghetti and heated up sauce. She and her husband sat down to eat as the wind howled and driving rain fell. ""We ate by candlelight, which we haven't done for 20 years,"" she said. CNN's Dan Merica contributed to this report.","The storm largely spared New York City .

"(CNN) -- On a visit to Japan on Tuesday, Vice President Joe Biden assured his hosts that the United States will express concerns to China over Beijing's recent claim of a large swath of airspace in the region. The Chinese declaration less than two weeks ago has prompted a war of words between governments and flights through the contested air zone by military planes from the United States, China, Japan and South Korea. ""We, the United States, are deeply concerned by the attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the East China Sea,"" Biden said at a news conference alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Asia trip gives Biden chance to show off diplomatic cred . ""I will be raising these concerns with great specificity directly when I meet with the Chinese leadership"" on a later leg of his trip, Biden said. The uneasy situation in the sky over the East China Sea has raised fears that a midair incident could cause circumstances to spiral out of control. It has also fueled concern about how far China is willing to go to pursue its interests in the Asia-Pacific region and push back against U.S. influence. ""The United States has an interest in the lowering of tensions in this vital region, as I believe all the countries in northeast Asia share that same interest with us,"" Biden said. China is asking aircraft entering its air defense zone to identify themselves and submit flight plans. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki reiterated Monday that Washington recognizes neither the air defense zone nor China's demand to be notified of plans by jets from other nations to fly into the area. Japan has told its airlines not to comply with the new Chinese demands, but the U.S. government has urged American carriers to follow Beijing's instructions. The Chinese action, Biden said, raises the possibility of ""accidents and miscalculation."" Biden promises to press China on airspace dispute . He praised the alliance between the United States and Japan, sayings the U.S. commitment to Japan is critical. He called Japan the cornerstone of stability in the region. Tokyo and Beijing's bitter dispute over a set of small, uninhabited islands in the East China Sea has already led to frequent tense encounters between the two sides' ships and planes over the past year. Now, China's new air defense zone overlaps significantly with that of Japan and encompasses the disputed islands and the natural resources around them. ""We meet in a moment, Prime Minister, when a new Asia Pacific is emerging, with limitless potential, but also new dynamics, rising tensions and the risk of miscalculation,"" Biden said. Geng Yansheng, spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, defended China's actions in a written statement. China's airspace claim, he said, ""is a zone of safety, not risks, a zone of cooperation, not competition."" China's air defense zone: What you need to know . China's actions are justified by what it sees as aggressive moves by the Japanese to lay claim to the disputed territory. ""Japan's actions have seriously harmed China's legitimate rights and security interests, and undermined the peace and stability in East Asia,"" Geng said. Without naming the United States, Geng warned third countries about becoming involved in the dispute. ""Other parties concerned should also mind their words and actions, and should not do things to undermine regional stability and bilateral relations,"" he said. ""Other parties should not be incited, or send wrong signals to make a very few countries go further on the wrong track, which will follow the same old disastrous road and undermine regional and world peace."" In addition to the China airspace claim, Biden and Abe discussed ways to fortify U.S.-Japan relations economically and militarily.","Vice President Joe Biden, visiting Japan, meets with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe .

"(CNN) -- Islamists, leftists and union members marched Friday in downtown Amman, demanding more significant economic and political reforms to help struggling citizens. About 3,000 people gathered in the Jordanian capital for the event, according to national police spokesman Lt. Col. Mohammad Al Khateeb. Half of those demonstrated, while the remainder walked alongside or watched from the sidelines. Al Khateeb said there were protests in six other cities on Friday, with crowd estimates totaling about 2,200. The demonstrations in Amman were the third in as many Fridays, with protesters gathering in front of the Al Husseini Mosque to decry government policies they blame for rising prices, low wages and unemployment. There were also calls for Prime Minister Samir Rifai, who took office in December 2009, to step down, and for the dissolution of parliament. The Islamic Action Front, the political arm of the Jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, is also asking for an ""elected government."" Currently, the prime minister and cabinet are appointed by King Abdullah II. In recent weeks, the government has announced several measures intended to ease citizens' economic hardships. These included reducing taxes on fuel derivatives and effectively subsidizing basic commodities. The government last week also announced a pay raise -- 20 Jordanian dinars per month -- for civil servants, military personnel and retirees. Still, protesters contended Friday that the measures don't go far enough. Besides their demands of Jordan's government, those in Amman also showed solidarity with others in the Arab world who have recently taken to the streets to demand certain freedoms and urge the ouster of their governments. Chanting, ""Egyptian nation, our beloved -- your redemption is near,"" the Jordanian demonstrators spoke to the thousands of protesters in that north African country, who hit the streets Friday calling for an end to President Hosni Mubarak's 30-year-rule.","Protestors demonstrate in Amman and six other Jordanian cities, a police spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- A senior Vatican official acknowledged Thursday there is ""no excuse"" for child sex abuse, as he and others were grilled by a U.N. committee about the Catholic Church's handling of pedophile priests. It's the first time the Vatican has been forced to answer allegations so publicly that it enabled the sexual abuse of children by protecting such priests. The committee questioned a handful of Vatican officials -- including Monsignor Silvano Tomasi, permanent observer of the Holy See to the United Nations in Geneva, and Monsignor Charles Scicluna, the Vatican's former chief sex-crimes prosecutor -- for several hours Thursday in Switzerland. In his opening remarks, Tomasi said, ""There is no excuse for any form of sexual violence or exploitation of children. Such crimes can never be justified, whether committed in the home, in schools, in community and sports programs, in religious organizations and structures. This is the longstanding policy of the Holy See."" He said the body would welcome any suggestions on promoting and respecting children's rights from the panel, the U.N. Committee on the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In a series of hard-hitting questions, committee member Sara Oviedo pressed Tomasi over what kind of sanctions are imposed on abusive priests and whether they are handed over to the justice systems of the countries where crimes are committed. The Vatican officials were also questioned on what is being done to prevent bishops transferring problem priests to different parishes in order to cover up their abuses. Since taking the helm of the Roman Catholic Church in March, Pope Francis has told a senior Vatican official to carry out ""due proceedings against the guilty"" in sexual abuse cases. Vatican sets up commission against sexual abuse of minors . Scicluna: No 'coverups' Scicluna said he was there to say that ""the Holy See 'gets it' "" with regard to the issue and that no one should stand in the way of the prosecution of abusive priests. ""Let's not say too late or not,"" he said. ""But there are certain things that need to be done differently. I would talk about cover-up, for example, because this is a very important concern."" States ""need to take action against citizens of the country who obstruct justice in such an egregious crime as sexual abuse of minors, whoever these people are,"" Scicluna said. ""It is not a policy of the Holy See to encourage cover-ups,"" he said. ""This goes against the truth. Only the truth will help us move on to a situation when we can start being ... an example of best practice."" This comes down to the Roman Catholic Church's work on the ground, Scicluna said, not just words. He said that education of clergy and laypeople connected to the church is key, as is the enforcement of guidelines on child protection. As for priests who have committed sexual abuse of minors, the Holy See has made clear in a letter to bishops that it is ""a no-go simply to move people from one place to another, from one diocese to another"" without being open about their backgrounds, Scicluna said. The Vatican officials were also quizzed on transparency. ""The best way to prevent new offenses is to reveal old ones and to remove the offender from positions where he or she will have the opportunity to reoffend -- so openness instead of sweeping the offenses under the carpet,"" a panel member said. The panel also urged the Vatican officials to do ""very concrete things"" to help those who have suffered abuse by clergy, and to give them ""closure"" so they can move forward. ""It's a first step,"" Joelle Casteix, a regional director for SNAP -- the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests -- said ahead of Thursday's hearing. ""Five years ago, we never thought that something like this would even be possible."" But the Center for Constitutional Rights, a nonprofit legal group which has worked alongside SNAP, said the Vatican had ""consistently refused to accept responsibility"" for sexual abuse of children and that its response was still ""unsatisfactory."" ""The Vatican attempted to relegate the issue to the past and claim it is a new era, that they now 'get it,' but they continue to refuse to turn over records for prosecution, punish higher-ups that covered up the crimes, or provide any real evidence that they are now putting the safety of children above the reputation of the Church,"" said an attorney for the center, Pam Spees. ""Nonetheless, today's hearing is a milestone in calling for an end to these days of impunity. The international community is demanding answers, and that is the first step toward true accountability and, we hope, an end to the widespread violence against children."" 'A wound that hurts the church' Panel members said that what the Vatican officials expressed Thursday was a welcome change in attitudes and that they wanted to see the measures promised become a reality. Tomasi assured them that action on the issue of sex abuse was a priority. ""For the Holy See, the whole problem of the abuse of children is a wound that hurts the church as a community of faith, and it's a suffering first of all within the community of faith,"" he said. ""And therefore it becomes not just a legal but moral and human commitment to continue to support and defend the principles of the convention that are protecting the children in a very specific way."" CNN's senior Vatican analyst, John Allen, said observers are looking to see whether the Vatican under Francis' leadership will crack down on bishops accused of covering up abuse by their priests. It's rare to see senior Vatican officials grilled in public in the way they were Thursday, Allen said. While the details that have emerged are not new, he said, the hearing signals that the world is watching to see whether the expectations of reform raised by Francis' steps so far will be matched by action on the ground. One matter of contention is that the Holy See argues that its direct jurisdiction extends only to the tiny Vatican City state and not to the Roman Catholic Church as a whole, although it provides guidelines to it. Other questions asked Thursday dealt with the church's approach to forced adoptions of children, including historical cases where religious bodies in Ireland and Spain are accused of removing children born to unmarried mothers, who were then given to ""more suitable"" adoptive parents. The panel asked the Vatican officials what action was being taken to reunite those children with their families and to punish those responsible for their removal. It also urged them to encourage care of orphaned or abandoned children in homes rather than in church-run institutions, where they may be vulnerable to abuse. The Holy See ratified the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990, but critics say it is failing to abide by its provisions. Pope Francis lays down the law on child sex abuse on Vatican grounds . Pope: 'Act decisively' In April, Francis recommended that the church's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ""act decisively with regard to cases of sexual abuse, first of all by promoting measures for the protection of minors, as well as in offering assistance to those who have suffered abuse, carrying out due proceedings against the guilty,"" the Vatican said at the time. The statement does not specify who ""the guilty"" are. But in recent years, priests, nuns and other people connected to the Catholic Church have been accused of sexually abusing children. Francis called for the church hierarchy to ""formulate and implement"" directives to address an area he described as ""so important"" to the church's credibility and worship. 'Most vulnerable' victims . Even with the inroads made, SNAP would like to see more action from the Vatican. ""Pope Francis has been a very popular pope, but when it comes to child sexual abuse, he has followed the same strategies as his predecessors,"" Casteix said. His predecessor, Benedict XVI, said many times that abusers should be prosecuted, but SNAP and other victims' groups said he did too little. Benedict spoke with some victims of sexual abuse by priests on papal visits to countries including the United States and the United Kingdom, where he expressed his ""deep sorrow"" about the scandal. The Vatican selected those he met. The challenge for Francis is to do more, Casteix said. ""This is a man who has a rock star-like popularity. He has reached out to the poor; he has reached out to the desperate and the vulnerable. But he has continually ignored the sex abuse victims, those who are the most vulnerable and who were hurt by his clerics,"" Casteix said. ""It is time, it is a simply easy thing for him to do, and I believe that this hearing will really prove to him and the world how important it is that he take decisive action to stop abuse and coverup.""","NEW: Vatican response still unsatisfactory, Center for Constitutional Rights says .

"(CNN) -- More rain was on the way after flooding forced hundreds of people in New Mexico to evacuate, prompting Gov. Susana Martinez to declare an emergency Friday. Martinez' declaration said evacuations by air and ground had taken place in Eddy County in southeastern New Mexico, Sierra County in the southwest part of the state and San Miguel County in the northeast. Her order provided funds for state emergency officials to assist local authorities and directed the National Guard to respond as needed. A state police diver and local firefighters staged a dramatic rescue of several people trapped by the rising Pecos River about 10 miles west of Roswell, officials said. The diver repeatedly crossed 30 feet of chest-deep rushing water carrying members of the group, which included children and elderly people. The evacuees were then taken to an American Red Cross shelter. Fifty people were moved to a Red Cross center at the high school in Las Vegas in northeast New Mexico, said Esteban Lujan, public information officer of the state Department of Homeland Security & Emergency Management. In Truth or Consequences, some bridges and roads were washed out and about 20 people evacuated, Lujan said. The National Weather Service said the threat of flooding will continue through the weekend.

"(CNN) -- Police released two photos Thursday of a man they suspect abducted the mother of Baltimore Orioles legend Cal Ripken Jr. from her Aberdeen, Maryland, home before she was found nearly 24 hours later tied up in the back seat of her car. The pictures, which appear to come from surveillance cameras, show a man wearing an orange and black baseball cap with sunglasses on the brim and a light-colored button-down shirt. There is also a $2,000 reward for a tip leading to the man's conviction, Aberdeen police said. A reward poster described the man as 5-feet-10, 180 pounds with short brown hair. Earlier police said he was in his late 30s to early 40s. Officials in Aberdeen say they are still looking for motives in the case and haven't found evidence of ransom demands for Violet Ripken, the mother of a baseball Hall of Famer. Ripken, 74, was safe and resting with relatives Wednesday after a nearly daylong ordeal, authorities said. Police said a man with a gun showed up at her home between 7 and 8 a.m. Tuesday, forced her into her vehicle and drove off. She was found about 6:15 a.m. Wednesday in the back seat of the vehicle near her home with her hands bound, but she was otherwise unharmed, police said. Michael Jackson's mom found safe, family drama unfolds . ""At this time I can say we know of no ransom demand,"" Aberdeen Police Chief Henry Trabert told reporters on Wednesday. He also said police don't know of any relationship between the suspect and the Ripken family. Trabert said Violet Ripken was understandably upset after the ordeal. The official said the suspect put sunglasses on the woman and they drove around all day and made stops for gas, using Ripken's credit cards at several places. The official said the suspect made no mention of Cal Ripken, an indication that he might not have known she is the mother of one of baseball's most popular stars. Police believe the suspect drove the woman's silver 1998 Lincoln Town Car throughout central Maryland but they aren't sure of precise locations. Rich Wolf, a spokesman for the FBI in Baltimore, said the agency is helping local police investigate the case. The Ripken family released a statement expressing gratitude for Violet Ripken's safe return. ""This has been a very trying time for our family, but we are grateful and relieved that mom is back with us, safe and healthy,"" the statement said. Cal Ripken Jr. achieved stardom as a shortstop with the Baltimore Orioles and is a member of baseball's Hall of Fame. He holds the Major League Baseball record for playing in the most consecutive games -- 2,632 from 1982 to 1998. He made 19 straight All-Star appearances and won two Most Valuable Player awards, racking up 3,184 hits and 431 home runs. He is a baseball analyst for TBS, which like CNN is owned by Time Warner. His Ripken Baseball group owns three minor league teams, including the Aberdeen IronBirds. Cal Ripken Sr. -- who was a manager, coach and scout in the Orioles organization for 36 years -- died in 1999.

"(CNN) -- A wall holding back 80 acres of sludge from a coal plant in central Tennessee broke this week, spilling more than 500 million gallons of waste into the surrounding area. Environmental Protection Agency officials are on the scene and expect the cleanup to to take four to six weeks. The sludge, a byproduct of ash from coal combustion, was contained at a retention site at the Tennessee Valley Authority's power plant in Kingston, about 40 miles east of Knoxville, agency officials said. The retention wall breached early Monday, sending the sludge downhill and damaging 15 homes. All the residents were evacuated, and three homes were deemed uninhabitable, a TVA spokesman told CNN. The plant sits on a tributary of the Tennessee River called the Clinch River. ""We deeply regret that a retention wall for ash containment at our Kingston Fossil Plant failed, resulting in an ash slide and damage to nearby homes,"" TVA said in a statement released Tuesday. TVA spokesman Gil Francis told CNN that up to 400 acres of land had been coated by the sludge, a bigger area than the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Video footage showed sludge as high as 6 feet, burying porches and garage doors. The slide also downed nearby power lines, though the TVA said power had been restored to the area. Francis said Environmental Protection Agency officials were on the scene and estimated the cleanup could take four to six weeks. Some of the goop spilled into the tributary, but preliminary water quality tests show that the drinking water at a nearby treatment plant meets standards. ""I don't want to drink it. It doesn't look healthy to me,"" Jody Miles, who fishes in the Clinch River, told CNN affiliate WBIR. ""Do you reckon they can bring all this life back that's going to die from all this mess?"" Still, there is the potential for more sludge to enter the water supply through waste runoff. ""We're taking steps to stabilize runoff from this incident,"" Francis said. Although video from the scene shows dead fish on the banks of the tributary, he said that ""in terms of toxicity, until an analysis comes in, you can't call it toxic."" One environmental attorney called that statement ""irresponsible."" The ash that gives sludge its thick, pudding-like consistency in this case is known as fly ash, which results from the combustion of coal. Fly ash contains concentrated amounts of mercury, arsenic and benzine, said Chandra Taylor, staff attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center. ""These things are naturally occurring, but they concentrate in the burning process and the residual is more toxic than it starts,"" she told CNN. Appalachian environmentalists compared the mess with another spill eight years ago in eastern Kentucky, where the bottom of a coal sludge impoundment owned by Massey Energy broke into an abandoned underground mine, oozing more than 300 million gallons of coal waste into tributaries. The water supply for more than 25,000 residents was contaminated, and aquatic life in the area perished. It took months to clean up the spill. ""If the estimates are correct, this spill is one and a half times bigger,"" said Dave Cooper, an environmental advocate with the Mountaintop Removal Road Show, a traveling program that explains the effect of an extreme form of mining. While the full scope of the TVA spill is being determined, coal critics are already concerned about its long-term effects. Cleaning up the mess, which could fill nearly 800 Olympic-size swimming pools, could take months or years, Taylor said. ""We're very concerned about how long it's going to take"" to clean the spill, she told CNN. Cooper agreed, saying, ""It's 4, 5 feet deep. How are you going to scoop it up? Where are you going to put it?""","Wall breach sends sludge downhill, causing damage to 15 homes .

"(CNN) -- There will be no contract deal Monday night between Chicago public school officials and the city's teacher's union, city school board President David Vitale said. Mayor Rahm Emanuel's spokeswoman, Sarah Hamilton, said talks were continuing late Monday, though Vitale said by then that he'd left the negotiating session for the night. ""We said to them again, 'We should resolve this tomorrow, we are close enough,'"" Vitale said. ""This is hard work. We want to get this resolved. We want our kids back in school."" The failure to produce a breakthrough comes a day after the Chicago Teacher's Union called a strike as school officials said they had nothing more to offer. The union has not stated, as of late Monday night, if the city's first teachers strike in 25 years will continue into a second day Tuesday in the absence of a deal. The strike left about 350,000 students with an unscheduled day off, and left some parents scrambling for alternatives. Police, expecting an uptick in trouble with more kids on the streets, pulled officers from desk duty to increase patrols due to the strike. Dozens of churches and civic organizations stepped in to provide activities for thousands of suddenly idle students, while the school district opened 144 of its 578 schools for part of the day to provide a safe environment and meals to children in need. Many children going to these in-school programs had to pass picket lines, as their teachers chanted, held signs and otherwise made their opinions heard. Ola Esho, father of a student at Ray Elementary School, told CNN affiliate WBBM he ""was not happy"" about the commotion and tension, which he said he unnerved his children. ""I would not want to keep my children here unnecessarily, so I'm taking them back home,"" said Yahu Vinayaraj, another father of children at the same school in the city's Hyde Park neighborhood. The union that represents nearly 30,000 teachers and support staff in the nation's third-largest school district called the strike after negotiators failed to reach a contract agreement with school administrators despite eight months of talks. The union said they were close Sunday night to a deal on pay, but far apart on teacher evaluations, benefits and other issues. Opinion: Whole world is watching Chicago . Mayor Rahm Emanuel said teachers were harming Chicago's children by striking. ""This is, in my view, a strike of choice, and it's the wrong choice for our children,"" he said. ""Stay at the table. Finish it for our children."" He said negotiators had resolved all but two issues -- teacher evaluations and provisions dealing with jobs for laid-off teachers. However, Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis said teachers had no choice but to strike, despite ""intense but productive"" bargaining sessions. The primary disagreement appears to be teacher job security in the wake of a new program that evaluates teachers based on students' standardized test scores. Chicago Teachers Union board member Jay Rehak called the idea ""data-driven madness."" As many as 6,000 teachers could lose their jobs under the evaluation system, according to Lewis, who called the system ""unacceptable."" The mayor's office, the city of Chicago, and school officials have questioned that job loss figure. Voices of the strike . ""This is no way to measure the effectiveness of an educator,"" Lewis said Sunday. ""Further, there are too many factors beyond our control which impact how well some students perform on standardized tests such as poverty, exposure to violence, homelessness, hunger and other social issues beyond our control."" Another sticking point is a ""recall"" policy that would put laid-off teachers in line for job openings at other schools within the district. Emanuel said such a policy, supported by the union, would take hiring decisions away from school principals and put them in the hands of central administrators and union leaders. ""Direction and dictation should not come out of downtown,"" the mayor said. Teachers also want to block changes to their health benefits and win concessions on classroom conditions. Pay is also an issue. However, the union said the two sides are close to a pay agreement after school officials offered to increase salaries 16% over four years on average for most teachers. The average teacher salary in Chicago was $74,839 for the 2011-2012 school year, according to the district. In addition to the pay raise, the school system's offer includes paid maternity leave and short-term disability coverage. It would also freeze health care cost increases for two-thirds of the union's membership. The high school day would also be shortened slightly, and teachers would be limited to teaching five classes, the district said. The district's existing proposal would cost $400 million over four years, according to school board President David Vitale. Key issues in Chicago school strike . Chicago schools can't afford more concessions, Vitale said. ""We have no more flexibility when it comes to finance,"" he told CNN on Monday. At a midday news conference, Emanuel called the plan on the table an ""honest compromise that respects our teachers, does right by our kids and is fair to our taxpayers."" Union officials have said they are puzzled by the stance of Emanuel, the city's Democratic mayor, whom they accused of going back on promises to teachers, police officers and other civil servants, according to Rehak, the union board member. ""He has definitely been a huge disappointment,"" Rehak said. ""He has disrespected virtually every middle-class person in this city."" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, urged a quick resolution. ""Both sides need to get back to the table as quickly as possible and really stay in there, negotiate through the night if necessary,"" he said Monday. ""Get it over with quickly so that we can get these kids back in school."" Read more about teacher unions on CNN's Schools of Thought blog . About 50,000 Chicago students who attend charter schools are unaffected by the strike and will remain in class. But that still leaves the vast majority of students, whose parents were encouraged by the school district to ""explore other options for their children"" as long as the strike continues. ""We know that a strike will put a strain on many families, and no one will be hurt more by a strike than our students,"" the district said on its website. One of the organizations opening doors for students during the strike is Young Chicago Authors, which has a free program for part of the day for students in grades six through 12. ""In collaboration with core performance artists and special guests, young people will see the power of their voices in action through film, performance and discussion,"" the group said. Still, some parents were concerned about what would happen to their children during the strike. ""If the kids are not in school, they're out getting into some kind of trouble ... when they should be in school, learning,"" said Shatara Scaggs, a mother of two children in kindergarten and first grade who opposes the teachers' decision to strike. ""I think they should be in school getting an education."" Are you there? Share your images and videos.

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- An empty chair stood in for imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo as he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in absentia on Friday amid protests and condemnation from China. China has responded furiously since the Nobel committee announced on October 8 that Liu would be its peace prize winner. Officials have repeatedly called Liu a common criminal and declared the award a Western plot against China. The rhetoric continued Friday with China calling the awarding of the prize to Liu a ""political farce."" ""The decision of the Norwegian Nobel Committee does not represent the wish of the majority of the people in the world, particularly that of the developing countries,"" said Jiang Yu, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official. Liu, a professor of literature, is serving an 11-year sentence in a Chinese prison for what the government called ""inciting subversion of state power."" He was not allowed to travel to Norway to accept the prize, nor was his wife, Liu Xia. Nobel committee chairman Thorbjorn Jagland, in awarding the prize Friday, likened Liu Xiaobo to Nelson Mandela, the former South African president who fought the apartheid regime. After announcing the award, Jagland placed Liu's medal in the empty chair, the second time such a symbol has been used in the event. Before the ceremony, some Twitter users who listed their location as Beijing had changed their profile pictures to an empty chair. In his speech, Jagland commended China for lifting millions out of poverty, but said democracy and free speech must go hand in hand with its economic development. ""China, too, will grow stronger if its people are granted civil rights,"" Jagland said. While Chinese officials have said the prize represents a Western perspective, human rights activists in China ""represent the world's common values and standards,"" Jagland said. He added that Liu has done nothing wrong and ""must be released."" U.S. President Barack Obama also called for Liu's immediate release. ""Mr. Liu reminds us that human dignity also depends upon the advance of democracy, open society, and the rule of law,"" Obama said in a statement. ""The values he espouses are universal, his struggle is peaceful, and he should be released as soon as possible."" As the awards ceremony was getting under way, a large number of officers stood guard outside the west central Beijing apartment complex where Liu's wife has been under house arrest since her husband's award was announced. Journalists were cordoned off in a small area next to the building. The police presence outside the Norwegian Embassy in Beijing had also increased early Friday as groups of protesters gathered there and at the city's U.N. offices. Jagland said Thursday that the award is not a protest. ""It is a signal to China that it would be very important for China's future to combine economic development with political reforms and it is support for those people in China who are struggling for basic human rights,"" Jagland told reporters. Beijing also put pressure on its allies and other countries not to attend the peace prize ceremony, and it hastily announced its own honor -- the Confucius Peace Prize, which was awarded Thursday to former Taiwanese Vice President Lien Chan. That award was accepted by a 6-year-old girl on Lien's behalf. Lien did not know about the prize, his office said. Amnesty International said it had received reports from ""reliable sources"" that Chinese diplomats in Norway have been pressuring Chinese residents into joining anti-Nobel demonstrations. On Thursday, the U.N.'s human rights chief called for Liu's release from prison and criticized what she said were ""recent restrictions placed on an ever-widening circle"" of the dissident's associates. ""In recent weeks, my office has received reports of at least 20 activists being arrested or detained and more than 120 other cases of house arrest, travel restrictions, forced relocations and other acts of intimidation,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay told reporters. Jagland said the committee expected a ""harsh reaction"" from Beijing. But ""we are very glad to see that two-thirds of the nations that have embassies in Oslo will be attending the ceremony, and most of them are very big, very important countries,"" he added. Among those attending was U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was part of the official delegation on behalf of Liu and his wife. Of the 19 countries that declined to come to Friday's ceremony -- including China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iraq and Iran -- Jagland said Thursday that two had reconsidered: Ukraine and the Philippines. But the state-run China Daily newspaper reported Friday that ""most nations"" had expressed their support for China's stance, citing a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman. The spokeswoman, Jiang Yu, said the award would not change the fact that ""Liu committed crimes."" Friday's ceremony included songs by a children's choir -- a special request made by Liu through his wife, according to Lundestad. And Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann was on hand to read one of Liu's ""most interesting and beautiful texts,"" Jagland said. Jagland predicted that keeping Liu, 54, in prison for the entirety of his 11-year sentence may prove impossible after the prize was awarded. ""The pressure from the outside world will be on China to release him. In today's world, it is totally impossible to close a country. We already know that a lot of Chinese know about the prize, and this is creating a huge pressure on China,"" Jagland said. Several foreign news websites -- including CNN and BBC -- were blocked in mainland China Thursday and Friday. Broadcasts of CNN International were blacked out intermittently, when news of the peace prize was reported. CNN reports about China's new Confucius Peace Prize were not blocked. Internet companies in China are treating Chinese characters for ""Liu Xiaobo,"" ""Nobel,"" and peace prize as ""sensitive words,"" said Jeremy Goldkorn, editor of Danwei.org -- a website about Chinese media and Internet. Acting on government instructions, the companies are deleting text containing those words, preventing such text from being uploaded, or returning no results on searches for the words, he said. ""I think the main aim is to reduce the chances of Chinese citizens seeing that the Liu Xiaobo Nobel Prize is big news internationally, and to make it more difficult for articles sympathetic to Liu Xiaobo and photos of him to be copied and circulated inside China,"" Goldkorn said. The last time an empty chair was used to represent an absent winner was when German peace activist Carl von Ossietzky won the 1935 award, according to Geir Lundestad, director of the Nobel Institute. Ossietzky was under ""protective custody"" in Nazi Germany and could not come to accept the award in person, nor was he represented by anyone. Three other Nobel peace laureates were also unable to attend their ceremonies for political reasons -- human rights activist Aung San Suu Kyi, Polish trade union leader Lech Walesa, and Russian Cold War dissident Andrei Sakharov -- but spouses or other relatives accepted the awards on their behalf. CNN's Jaime FlorCruz, Jo Ling Kent, Stan Grant and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama says Liu Xiaobo ""should be released as soon as possible""

"(CNN) -- Another week, another North Korean provocation. It might seem an understandable reaction to news Monday that North and South Korea had exchanged hundreds of shells across their western sea border. The incident occurred a day after Pyongyang had warned it was preparing to test another nuclear device, and just a week after it tested two medium-range ballistic missiles. But should the West greet such saber-rattling with a shrug of the shoulders? After all, Western capitals have been engaging in this ""dance"" for two decades, since the late Kim Jong Il took over as the country's supreme leader. Is this latest round of provocations under his son and successor, Kim Jong Un, simply more of what we've seen before? Not necessarily, argue some of those closely familiar with North Korea. They warn that under Kim Jong Un's rule, Pyongyang has shown an even greater willingness to raise the stakes, whether it be the multiple missile launches over the past several weeks, the way it stoked a crisis last spring when it announced it had ended the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement and moved intermediate missiles to its east coast, or its warning that foreign companies and tourists in South Korea should evacuate. South Korea investigates two suspected North Korea drones . More recently, in the U.S. intelligence community's annual worldwide threat assessment, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper warned that North Korea had ""expand(ed) the size of its Yongbyon enrichment facility and restart(ed) the reactor that was previously used for plutonium production"" but was shut down in 2007. ""The regime still acts in a very belligerent manner, but it seems less predictable, and more random,"" said Christian Whiton, deputy envoy to North Korea during the George W. Bush administration. Timeline: North Korea nuclear program . The younger Kim (and young is the right word -- he is still only 31) took office in December 2011, amid questions over how much control he really has over the levers of power, including the country's military of more than 1 million people. Since then, North Korea has faced additional international sanctions after the launch of a long-range rocket in December 2012, a move that it followed up with the country's third nuclear test, in February 2013. ""The timing and the intensity of North Korea's provocations (since Kim Jong Un took office) clearly demonstrates a high tolerance for risk,"" said Ellen Kim, assistant director of the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Since (Kim) took power he has purged almost all of his elder guardians ... and filled his surroundings with new faces. We are in a situation where we are learning about him a little bit every day through his unpredictable behavior and actions, which is why the current situation with North Korea is a lot more dangerous than before,"" she said. But James Person, coordinator of the North Korea International Documentation Project at the Woodrow Wilson Center, suggested this week's exchange of live fire is not, on its own, too troubling. ""North Korea actually warned South Korea in advance that they were going to carry out live-fire drills in seven locations. They advised the South to remove ships from the area. All of the shells fell in the water. No land or military installations were targeted,"" Person said. ""This is comparatively a very mild provocation."" Person said the latest incidents might reflect North Korean frustration on a number of issues, not least the recent joint military drills between South Korea and the United States, which Person described as the largest such exercises in two decades. But most important, Person said, is concern in North Korea over the pace of improved relations with South Korea and the United States. All just guesswork? Of course, the most oft-stated problem with speculating on North Korean intentions has been the claim that the information coming out of the country is just too limited to make any concrete assumptions. ""There are no countries as closed as North Korea. Its citizens aren't allowed to travel, and the few North Korean officials who do go abroad are closely watched. You basically have to go back to Stalin's Soviet Union to find something similar,"" Whiton said. ""This makes it difficult to collect even the most basic background information about what is going on, and recruiting espionage sources is very difficult. The regime is very good at preventing knowledge of its inner workings."" South Korea captures a North Korean fishing boat . A troubling glimpse of what is going on inside North Korea came with a U.N. report released in February. In a 372-page report, the Commission of Inquiry on Democratic People's Republic of Korea outlined claims of ""extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape ... and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation."" ""The gravity, scale, duration and nature of the unspeakable atrocities committed in the country reveal a totalitarian state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world,"" the report stated. Yet understanding the inner workings of the regime has proven a tougher nut to crack. This was evident in the speculation that swirled around the younger Kim when it became clear he was the most likely candidate to succeed his father; media reports were full of chatter about whether Kim Jong Un's time at a Swiss boarding school, and his apparent love of basketball, were an indication that he might be more friendly toward the West. China, North Korea slam U.N. human rights report . Indeed, according to a leaked cable published by WikiLeaks, Japan's intelligence community was said to have relied in part on the book of a former sushi chef for insights into the elder Kim's behavior. Even China, the closest thing North Korea has to a reliable ally, doesn't fully understand the power struggle going on at the top of the North Korean regime, suggested Minxin Pei, a leading China watcher and director of the Keck Center for International and Strategic Studies at Claremont McKenna College.

"(CNN) -- Gary Ribble would not be able to read this story if not for people like you. Ribble, who has chronic lymphocytic leukemia in addition to severe diabetes and impaired hearing, needed new eyeglasses last spring but couldn't afford them after losing a job he'd held for more than 40 years. Then he found out about the Modest Needs Foundation. The grass-roots charity pools thousands of small donations to help people get through short-term financial crises. Donors direct their dollars to the requests they want to fund. ""I need these glasses very badly or I will have to stop doing a lot of what I do: reading, writing, and working with my computer; I just can't see that well at all,"" Ribble wrote in his request. Eleven visitors to modestneeds.org pitched in, and within a week Ribble, who lives in a trailer in Nappanee, Indiana, received a $364 check that changed his life. ""When I found my message from Modest Needs today that help was on the way, I cried a few tears of happiness knowing that I would be able to see again,"" he wrote in a thank you note. Stories like that make Modest Needs Foundation founder and CEO Keith Taylor giddy. ""It is so much fun to read these testimonials,"" Taylor said. ""It's like Christmas every day."" People often don't realize how powerful just 10 or 20 dollars can be, Taylor said. In many cases, a small amount can stop a crisis in its tracks. ""It's wonderful to see what this does for people,"" Taylor said. ""You don't find out until after the fact what kind of an impact these little contributions that people are making; ... you have no idea what kind of a change you really are making in the person's life."" Cady Stanton, a graduate student at Pennsylvania State University, gave $20 to help fund Ribble's request. ""Glasses are such a small thing, right?"" she said. ""I mean, the man's worked 40-some years and he has cancer. The least he should be able to do is have some glasses. Our social contract with our country -- we should have glasses. I mean, come on. It's not that big of a deal."" Ribble wrote a beautiful thank you note that was passed along to the donors. Stanton keeps a copy of it on her desk. ""Your generosity overwhelms me and I just can't say in words how very happy I am and I thank God that someone cared enough for a disabled man, in a very hardship situation, to help me out to see better,"" the note read in part. Taylor founded the site seven years ago out of a similar sense of gratitude. One evening in 2002 he was marveling at how happy his life was, and remembered a few singular acts of kindness that had helped him get there. For example, while in graduate school in Tennessee, he incurred a car repair bill that used up his rent money. His boss at his part-time job at a movie theater paid the rent for him -- not a loan, a gift. As he reflected on his good fortune, Taylor pledged, ""When I'm really rich I'm going to start an organization to help the working poor."" That's when his ""aha!"" moment came. ""It occurred to me all of a sudden that no one who had ever helped me had ever been wealthy, they had just been nice. They'd just had compassion,"" he said. Taylor decided to set aside $350 to help one individual per month get through a crisis. He created a crude Web site inviting requests, expecting his effort to remain small, personal and obscure -- ""on the millionth page of Google."" But this was the Internet. A well-meaning friend posted a link on the widely read blog Metafilter.com, and the next day Taylor was swamped with 1,100 e-mails. Many were asking for help, some were skeptical of Taylor's motives, and a surprising number of people wanted to contribute, he said. At first he fended off would-be donors, because his vision for the project was limited, he said. But the e-mails and offers to donate kept coming, along with more requests for help. Taylor soon incorporated Modest Needs as a nonprofit organization. Modest Needs' first grant saved a woman's life: It paid for a mammogram that found a tumor, Taylor said. The organization has done nothing but grow ever since. By the end of December, Taylor expects to have made $2.4 million in grants in 2009. ""Every day is another miracle,"" Taylor said. ""It's beyond my imagination."" Here's how it works: People e-mail their requests -- help with rent or a car repair or a medical bill, for example -- to Modest Needs, whose seven-person staff researches and verifies their legitimacy. The vetted requests are then posted on ModestNeeds.org, where donors can choose which ones they want to help fund. Once the funding level is reached, a check is sent out. Gift certificates are available. A donor can contribute any amount and then let the gift recipient decide where it should go. ""You're talking about huge, huge numbers of individual people giving just a little bit of what they have to make the lives of people who have short-term emergencies a little bit better by just keeping them on track, keeping them out of the social services system altogether,"" Taylor said. Those individual contributions are multiplied by matching grants from larger donors, including musician and recording company executive Herb Alpert and his wife, Lani Hall Alpert. ""We really wanted to help him [Taylor] grow that community of small giving,"" said Rona Sebastian, president of the Herb Alpert Foundation. The Alperts were also struck by how many Modest Needs grant recipients -- 68 percent, Taylor said -- turned around and became donors to the organization, Sebastian said. ""That was extremely exciting to us because that was something we found to be very powerful,"" she said. Ribble is among those rebound donors: Despite his poverty, he donates $5 a month to help others through Modest Needs.","NEW: Thousands in donations pour in after story is published .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two hit-and-run deaths in rural Mississippi just a few miles apart highlight a disturbing problem about data collection on possible hate crimes. Last summer, 61-year-old African-American Sunday school teacher Johnny Lee Butts was hit and killed by an 18-year-old white driver. The teen told Panola County Sheriff deputies he thought he hit a deer but the driver's two passengers said he steered straight for Butts. One passenger said he could see that Butts was black. The killing has sparked outrage in the local African-American community. Civil rights groups have demanded that police prosecute Butts' killing as a hate crime. Nonetheless, prosecutors chose not to. There was no evidence, authorities said, to suggest a racial motive. The driver was charged with murder. He has not yet pleaded in the case. Related: Three plead guilty in Mississippi hate crime . In another hit and run, 41-year-old African-American Garrick Burdette was found dead along a Panola County road in November 2009. His mother, Ruby Burdette, says for three years she had heard nothing about any police investigation into her son's death until CNN began asking about the case. Update: Burdette case didn't have to go cold . CNN received no response after calling the Panola County Sheriff's department, but just hours after CNN's call, a sheriff's investigator drove to Ruby Burdette's house. ""He came in and said he was the investigator,"" she told CNN. ""He told me he apologized for no one coming out before now. And he told me that the first investigators they had didn't do anything."" If police suspect Burdette's death was a hate crime, they're not saying. And even if Burdette's death turns out to be a hate crime, there's a chance it won't even be reported. ""The data sucks,"" said Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks the issue. ""Hate crime data as the FBI reports is underreported by an ungodly amount."" In 2005, 2006 and 2007 there were zero hate crime incidents reported in the state of Mississippi, according to the FBI. ""States like California have thousands of hate crimes, and the state of Mississippi with its record of racial animus has none?"" said Beirich. ""It's ridiculous.""' Federal law has required states to collect hate crime data since the early 1990s. Congress has defined a hate crime as a ""criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender's bias against a race, religion, disability, ethnic origin or sexual orientation."" But states don't have to report their data to the FBI if they don't want to. Four states -- Indiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and Ohio -- don't even have a Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. The result, critics say, is a federal data system that costs $1 million-plus but offers very little help to authorities who investigate, identify and track hate crimes. ""We can only report by the numbers we are given,"" said the FBI's Michelle Klimt, who says the lack of data could be because of a lack of state funding. In states that do have UCR programs, the FBI offers training for state and local law enforcement on how to collect and report hate crime data. On Capitol Hill, 26 senators have asked U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to expand UCR programs to include tracking of hate crimes against Hindus, Arabs and Sikhs. Last year's deadly attack on a Wisconsin Sikh temple raised awareness about crimes targeting Sikhs. ""Without accurate, nuanced reporting of these crimes, it is more difficult for federal, state, and local law enforcement to assess and respond to the particular threat that the Sikh community faces,"" the senators said last month in a letter to Holder. If authorities don't know how many hate crimes are committed, it's difficult to get an accurate picture of whether hate crime laws are effective. In a 2011 killing that received national attention, authorities in Mississippi did prosecute the hit-and-run murder of James Craig Anderson, an African-American auto plant worker, as a hate crime. The attack was captured on video by a hotel security camera. Anderson's accused killer, Deryl Dedmon, who is white, pleaded guilty last year to murder and hate-crime charges and was sentenced to life in prison. So how many possible hate crimes are actually committed throughout the United States each year? No one really knows. In fact, the difference between data from different federal agencies is alarming. A survey by the Bureau of Justice Statistics counts around 190,000 hate crimes a year, compared with the FBI, which counts somewhere between 6,000 and 8,000, Beirich said. Here are some of the reasons behind the gap: . Instead of using information from law enforcement -- like the FBI -- the Bureau of Justice Statistics uses information directly from victims. It's based on interviews with thousands of households each year where people say whether they believe they were victims of hate crimes. ""Sometimes victims don't go to the police,"" said Klimt. ""And sometimes the police report is not filed."" And if police don't know about a crime, they can't report it to the FBI. The BOJ statistics, which supporters say generally provide a more accurate picture of crime, cost $23 million more a year to produce than the FBI's annual hate crime stats. The FBI stats show the following trends in hate crimes reported by states from 2008-2011: . -- Crimes linked to bias against sexual orientation increased from 16.7% to 20.8%. -- Crimes linked to religious, ethnic and disability bias were unchanged. -- Racially motivated hate crimes -- the most commonly reported type -- decreased from 51.3% to 46.9%. Back in Mississippi, Ruby Burdette's pain over the death of her son has been resurfacing as police investigate the case more than three years later. She believes it could have been racially motivated. ""I would hate to say it, but it could,"" she said. ""Being a mother, I want the truth to come out."" In the end, she may never know.

"(CNN) -- Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated and possession of a controlled substance on Friday, just over two months after his arrest, a prosecutor said. The misdemeanor charges filed Friday are pending in Hamilton County, Indiana, Superior Court, Prosecuting Attorney D. Lee Buckingham's office said in a press release. The drug was identified in a court filing as oxycodone and/or hydrocordone. Irsay's initial hearing on both counts is scheduled for June 19. The Colts owner and CEO's legal team, in a statement after the charges were announced, thanked the Hamilton County prosecutor's office ""for its professionalism in its investigation."" The statement pointed out that authorities determined that ""the facts in this matter did not warrant the filing of felony charges relative to Mr. Irsay's prescription medications. ""Mr. Irsay will deal with the remaining misdemeanor charges through the judicial process,"" the statement added. Police in Carmel had earlier said that Irsay was stopped at 11:41 p.m. on March 16 for driving slowly, stopping in a roadway and failing to use his turn signal. The probable cause affidavit indicates that the Colts owner's speech was ""slow and slurred,"" his eyes were ""red and glassy"" and his balance was ""very unsteady."" He failed a number of field sobriety tests, had trouble reciting the alphabet and told an officer ""that he was having a hard time finding his house."" In addition, a search of his vehicle found prescription drugs in bottles, police said in a press release. The drugs were not associated with any prescription bottles in the vehicle, according to police. The next day, Irsay ""voluntary checked into a highly respected health care facility,"" according to the Colts. ""(He) is committed committed to undergoing the treatment and care necessary to help him meet his challenges head-on,"" added the team. Irsay is the first National Football League owner to face criminal charges since Eddie DeBartolo of the San Francisco 49ers was indicted on federal racketeering charges in 1997. In that time, the league -- including its current commissioner, Roger Goodell -- have frequently punished players for off-the-field indiscretions that landed them in court. It remains to be seen what will happen, then, to the 54-year-old Irsay, who has largely stayed out of the public spotlight -- except for regular tweets -- since his arrest. In a brief statement Friday, the league said, ""The NFL's Personal Conduct Policy applies to all league personnel and holds all of us accountable. We are reviewing the matter and will take appropriate action in accordance with the policy. The Colts owner -- whose father, Robert Irsay, owned the team before him -- has spoken publicly about his struggles with substance abuse as well as his efforts to stay sober.

"(CNN) -- Olek Doba's slow, lonely kayak journey across the Atlantic Ocean is nearing an end this week. Doba, 67, isn't making the record-setting transatlantic trip for money, but because it's on his bucket list, a friend waiting for his arrival in North America said. He has no corporate sponsors. The only logo on his yellow 21-foot boat is the name of his hometown: Police, Poland. Doba is paying his own way with his retirement money saved during his career as an engineer, according to Piotr Chmielinski, a friend who helps with his logistics. Doba began paddling the kayak, named Olo, in Lisbon, Portugal, last October with a goal of reaching the Florida coast more than 5,000 miles away. At a pace of about 30 miles a day, he hoped to get there in February. A broken rudder and unusual weather patterns slowed Doba, but he wasn't stopped. He refused a rescue offer from a tanker when his communications gear failed in the middle of the Atlantic in December. He was forced to make a monthlong pit stop in Bermuda when the rudder broke in February, but he was back in the water in late March, Chmielinski said. Another mishap broke his navigation light and radar antennae, which he repaired using a boat paddle and soda bottle. By Tuesday, Doba was less than 200 miles from his destination of New Smyrna Beach, Florida. He still has to paddle through the Gulf Stream currents around the Bahamas. The mayor and a high school band will be on the beach to greet Doba when he makes landfall, which is expected Friday morning unless another storm kicks up, Chmielinski said. Doba's voyage is the longest ever in a kayak and the first to go from Europe to North America, he said. This would be his second complete transatlantic kayak trip in four years. He paddled the Olo from Africa to Brazil over 99 days in 2010. Doba expects to have another 30 years left in his life to explore the world, because members of his family are known to live to 100, Chmielinski said.","Olek Doba has no corporate sponsors, but is using retirement funds .

"Washington (CNN) -- To President Barack Obama and U.S. allies in Europe, Sunday's secession referendum in Crimea is unconstitutional, illegal and a fraud because Russian troops have essentially taken over the southern Ukraine peninsula. To Russian President Vladimir Putin, it is a chance for Crimean residents to decide if they want to realign their region with Moscow after the political strife in Ukraine that ousted the pro-Russian leader last month. Whatever the outcome, the vote planned by Crimea's regional parliament and endorsed by Russia's government will further inflame the Ukrainian crisis as the United States and European Union seek a diplomatic solution while threatening diplomatic and political sanctions. Here are some of the biggest questions about the issue, with a look at how key players are weighing in: . 1) What is the Crimean referendum? Voters in the autonomous Ukrainian region of about 2 million people will choose between asserting independence from the former Soviet republic or joining neighboring Russia. There is no option for the status quo -- remaining a part of Ukraine. Voters must be older than 18 and bring ID documents to show they are a resident of Crimea in order to cast a ballot. Officials say voters can expect to see members of the local electoral commission and observers at their allocated polling station, which will be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. local time. Results are expected Monday and U.S. officials have made clear they expect Crimean voters to choose to become part of Russia. The referendum follows the lightning chain of events in Ukraine in recent months that included increasingly violent protests against the government, the country's pro-Russian President fleeing across the border, and then Russian troops seizing what amounts to military control of Crimea -- where Russia's Black Sea fleet is based. By unanimously backing the referendum, the Crimean parliament signaled the intentions of regional leaders as well as Russia to restore the territory to Moscow's control. Ukraine's interim government insists Crimea is part of the country, a stance supported by the United States and its European allies. Disturbing tales emerge from Crimea . 2) Is it legal? Depends on who you ask. In Ukraine, the interim government rejects the referendum as unconstitutional, while many in the pro-Russian Crimea region desire the chance to again align with Moscow. Russia says the political upheaval in Ukraine that forced out President Viktor Yanukovych ended the Kiev government's constitutional authority. Russian President Vladimir Putin calls the ousting of Yanukovych an anti-constitutional coup, and he argues the people of Crimea should have the right to decide their future in the same way as other autonomous regions, such as Kosovo's breakaway from Serbia. However, Obama and European leaders insist the Crimean referendum would violate the Ukrainian constitution and international law. Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN last week that the Ukrainian constitution requires territorial referendums to be held ""across the entirety of Ukraine and not just in a sub-region like this."" She argued that Yanukovych fled of his own volition, and that constitutional authority agreed to in a February 21 deal he reached with opposition leaders and European envoys remained in effect. Under that agreement, Ukraine will elect a new government on May 25 for the entire country, including Crimea. Russian Parliament backs Crimea vote, brushes off sanctions threat . 3) What would it mean? Obama's quick condemnation of a Crimean referendum showed the United States expects the outcome to favor realigning with Russia. The autonomous region has a 60% ethnic Russian population, having been part of Russia until it was ceded to Ukraine in 1954 when both countries belonged to the Soviet Union. Power said that if the referendum goes forward, the result would get little recognition beyond Russia. That didn't matter in 2008 when Russia under Putin sent troops into neighboring Georgia, another former Soviet territory, to back autonomy for the pro-Russian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. More than five years later, both territories are effectively annexed with Russian forces still present. Asked if Crimea and perhaps other parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that favor Russia might end up the same, Power said: ""I think it's maybe not helpful to talk about precedents."" ""We are seeking to create a future where the past is not replicated here in Ukraine,"" she added. Cyberwar hits Ukraine . 4) Potential fallout? For Russia, a major motivation is ensuring control of its Black Sea fleet based in Sevastopol, as well as its economic influence in Ukraine and other former Soviet territories and satellites. The Crimean referendum would provide an electoral justification for what amounts to a land grab amid Ukraine's political upheaval. Obama acknowledged Russia had legitimate concerns that needed to be part of a solution, such as guarantees it could maintain the Sevastopol-based naval fleet in Ukraine. However, his call for Russian troops in Crimea to return to their barracks and negotiations between Russia and Ukraine on a solution has so far yielded little progress. Both the United States and European Union have threatened sanctions if no significant progress occurs soon, but major economic ties between Russia and European powers, such as Germany, raise questions about the strength of any EU steps. Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday that if the Crimean referendum proceeds with no sign of movement by Russia on negotiating with Ukraine on the crisis, ""there will be a very serious series of steps Monday in Europe and here."" To CNN's Fareed Zakaria, Putin may get his wish with Crimea, but at a cost. ""They got Crimea, but they've scared off Ukraine,"" he said. ""And, most importantly, the people of Ukraine are now deeply suspicious of Russia. The people in Poland and Hungary and the Czech Republic, or probably in places like Kazakhstan, are all now fearful."" CNN's Mariano Castillo and Lena Kashkarova contributed to this report.","People in Crimea, an autonomous region of Ukraine, vote Sunday on joining Russia .

"(CNN) -- Florida cannot use a hard cutoff on a convict's IQ as the sole basis for determining eligibility for execution, a divided U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday. The 5-4 decision favored a Florida death-row inmate who supporters say is intellectually disabled. The court struck down the state's requirement that a baseline ""threshold"" IQ score of 70 must be established before a capital prisoner can present additional evidence supporting claims of a disability. At issue was how states may define mental retardation -- within the context of inexact IQ tests -- when determining whether convicted murderers deserve capital punishment. The high court in 2002 banned execution for those who were determined to be suffering from what was then labeled mental retardation. But the court left it to the states to establish standards of measurement. In the case decided on Tuesday, the majority led by Justice Anthony Kennedy concluded that Florida's limits were too rigid and thus unconstitutional. ""Florida's law contravenes our nation's commitment to dignity and its duty to teach human decency as the mark of a civilized world,"" Kennedy said. About a dozen death penalty states have some kind of bright-line IQ cutoff, either at scores of 70 or 75. But Florida is only one of a few states with what Kennedy called a ""rigid formula."" Freddie Lee Hall was convicted and sentenced to death in 1978 along with an accomplice for the brutal murder of Karol Hurst. The 21-year-old Leesburg resident was seven months pregnant. She was abducted from a grocery store, raped, shot to death, and her body dragged into the woods. Later that evening, Hall and his accomplice were involved in a separate shooting death of a sheriff's deputy. Ten years later, Hall's attorney's appealed, saying his client had a lengthy record of mental retardation diagnoses. An average of various tests put his IQ slightly above 70, but within what is called a SEM -- standard error of measurement. The state supreme court said Florida's law meant any capital inmate above that benchmark cannot take the next step and present further mitigating evidence to demonstrate his mental capacity lacks culpability for his crimes. Lawyers for Hall told the court that four other states in particular -- Alabama, Idaho, Kentucky, and Virginia -- have ignored the court's precedent, trying to impose inflexible standards that go against the accepted views of professional psychologists. Kennedy, as the familiar ""swing vote"" determining the outcome, said professional clinicians have a built-in margin for error the state was ignoring. ""The flaws in Florida's law are the result of the inherent error in IQ tests themselves. An IQ score is an approximation, not a final and infallible assessment of intellectual functioning,"" he said. ""Freddie Lee Hall may or may not be intellectually disabled, but the law requires that he have the opportunity to present evidence of his intellectual disability, including deficits in adaptive functioning over his lifetime,"" Kennedy added. Justice Antonin Scalia was among four more conservative colleagues to dissent, with Justice Samuel Alito saying the majority's conclusions were ""unwise."" ""There is therefore no excuse for mechanically imposing standards that are unhinged from legal logic and that override valid state laws establishing burdens of proof,"" said Alito. ""The appropriate confidence level is ultimately a judgment best left to legislatures, and their judgment has been that a defendant must establish that it is more likely than not that he is intellectually disabled. I would defer to that determination."" He was also supported by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas. Justices side with Secret Service over anti-Bush protest .

"(CNN) -- In another controversy surrounding New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer said Sunday that Christie directly ordered the withholding of Superstorm Sandy recovery funds unless she backed a redevelopment plan he favored. Appearing on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Zimmer said she was told by a member of Christie's administration that Sandy relief funds hinged on her support for a real estate development project and that the directive was coming directly from Christie. ""She said that to me -- is that this is a direct message from the Governor,"" Zimmer said, referring to Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, who Zimmer said approached her in a parking lot in May to deliver the message. It's ""stunning"" and ""outrageous,"" but true, the Hoboken mayor told CNN's Candy Crowley. ""I stand by my word."" Later in the day, she released a statement saying that she had met with the U.S. Attorney's Office for several hours at its request and provided the office with her journal and other documents. ""As they pursue this investigation, I will provide any requested information and testify under oath about the facts of what happened when the Lieutenant Governor came to Hoboken and told me that Sandy aid would be contingent on moving forward with a private development project,"" she said. Zimmer said the Christie administration wanted her to approve a project by The Rockefeller Group, a real estate developer with ties to Christie's administration. When asked by CNN to respond to Zimmer's accusation that Christie had a direct hand in the threat, Christie spokesman Colin Reed refused to address it and instead referred to a previous statement, which said Zimmer's allegations that relief funds were withheld is based on partisan politics. The allegations come as other controversies revolve around Christie's administration. In one, evidence mounts showing that Christie aides were involved in tying up traffic in a town at the foot of the George Washington Bridge in what may have been an act of political retribution against another mayor. In another, the Christie administration hired a firm for post-Sandy tourism ads that cost nearly twice as much as the next highest proposal. This is the first time Christie has been directly connected to the controversy. Christie administration pushes back . In his statement to CNN on Saturday, Reed blasted Zimmer's claim that the funds were based on the real estate project. He said her accusations are false, adding, ""It's very clear partisan politics are at play here as Democratic mayors with a political ax to grind come out of the woodwork and try to get their faces on television."" Reed went on to attack the cable news channel that first broke the news Saturday. ""MSNBC is a partisan network that has been openly hostile to Governor Christie and almost gleeful in their efforts attacking him,"" Reed said. MSNBC said its story is based on an interview with Zimmer ""and e-mails and personal notes she shared with MSNBC."" The Governor's spokesman also said the Mayor and Governor have had a ""productive relationship,"" noting an August tweet by Zimmer saying she's ""very glad Governor Christie has been our Gov."" Christie marches on as controversy at home unfolds . Zimmer's comments Saturday and Sunday are a change from what she told CNN just last week, when she said that while she wondered whether Sandy aid funds were being withheld because she didn't endorse the governor's re-election, she concluded that ""I don't think that's the case."" ""I don't think it was retaliation and I don't have any reason to think it's retaliation, but I'm not satisfied with the amount of money I've gotten so far,"" Zimmer told CNN last week, not mentioning her concerns about the redevelopment project. But Sunday morning, Zimmer told CNN's Crowley that she didn't speak out before because she didn't think anyone would believe her, adding that she is now ""offering to testify under oath."" Zimmer admitted to supporting Christie in the past, saying she is not a part of ""the Democratic machine."" But the information around the George Washington Bridge scandal -- involving lane closures at the entrance to the busy bridge, apparently for political retaliation -- prompted her to speak. She said she sees parallels between her story and the bridge controversy: ""The Christie administration using their authority to try and get something."" Zimmer said Guadagno appeared to feel guilty for delivering the message. ""I believe if and when she is asked to testify under oath, the truth will come out, because I believe she will be truthful and she will tell the truth,"" Zimmer told Crowley. Zimmer also said she is speaking because she wants Hoboken to receive an appropriate level of funds in the second round of recovery dollars about to be released. Sandy recovery funds . After Sandy, Hoboken was 80% underwater. Zimmer told CNN last week that Hoboken received only about $300,000 of the roughly $100 million in state funds the city requested for flood prevention. Reed, Christie's spokesman, told CNN that Zimmer asked for $100 million from a roughly $300 million pot of money for which there was $14 billion worth of requests. Since that request, Reed said, Hoboken has been approved for nearly $70 million in aid. The city has also been identified as a pilot community for a federal program to prevent flooding, one of only four such projects in New Jersey. Zimmer, however, had a different account of allocated funds. She said the $70 million given to Hoboken was through flood insurance and other mechanisms that did not need approval from the state. She received only $300,000 in Christie-approved funds, she said. CNN received images of journal entries from the Mayor's office that Zimmer told CNN she wrote at the time. See the journal entries . In one, Zimmer writes that the conversation with Guadagno left her upset and shattered the image she had of Christie. ""I thought he was honest, I thought he was moral -- I thought he was something very different. This week I found out he's cut from the same corrupt cloth that I have been fighting for the last four years. I am so disappointed -- it literally brings tears to my eyes,"" the journal entry says. Zimmer also wrote that Guadagno told her she needs ""to move forward with the Rockefeller project. It is very important to the Gov."" Reed, asked by CNN about Zimmer's comments on Guadagno, said, ""Mayor Zimmer's characterization of her conversation in Hoboken is categorically false."" Three days after the purported Guadagno comments, state Community Affairs Commissioner Richard Constable was on a panel with Zimmer, discussing Sandy relief. Zimmer told MSNBC that Constable leaned over and told her, ""If you move (the redevelopment project) forward, the money would start flowing to you."" In a statement to CNN, Constable spokeswoman Lisa Ryan said, ""Mayor Zimmer's allegations that on May 16, 2013, in front a live auditorium audience Commissioner Constable conditioned Hoboken's receipt of Sandy aid on her moving forward with a development project is categorically false."" Debate about redevelopment . Zimmer's claims center around a property owned by The Rockefeller Group, which had its plan for ""redevelopment"" of a three-block area of Hoboken rejected by the city's planning board. Instead, the panel voted to classify the area owned by the company as available for ""rehabilitation."" The ""redevelopment"" label was sought because its tax incentives offered a much more lucrative deal for the development company. Aides and advisers to Christie have ties to Wolff & Samson, the law firm representing The Rockefeller Group. The Hoboken Planning Board rejected the ""redevelopment"" plan three days before Zimmer was allegedly first approached by Guadagno. Zimmer provided MSNBC with a 2012 e-mail from Wolff & Samson's Lori Grifa -- previously commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs -- to Hoboken's lawyer that shows her lobbying on behalf of the project: ""Our client, The Rockefeller Group, has specifically asked us to speak with you regarding its property in Hoboken."" Grifa is not the only connection between the Christie administration and The Rockefeller Group. The Samson in Wolff & Samson is David Samson, chairman of the Port Authority, who was appointed by Christie. Samson was recently served with a subpoena in the George Washington Bridge case by an investigative committee seeking relevant documents. The Rockefeller Group told CNN, ""We have no knowledge of any information pertaining to this allegation. If it turns out to be true, it would be deplorable."" The law firm, in a statement, denied Zimmer's allegations and said it did nothing wrong: ""The firm's and Ms. Grifa's conduct in the representation of our client was appropriate in all respects. Further, Ms. Grifa notes that while DCA Commissioner, she never met with Mayor Zimmer or The Rockefeller Group to discuss the Hoboken project."" Zimmer told MSNBC that she couldn't agree to The Rockefeller Group proposal because ""there are fundamental problems with the site in northern Hoboken, including traffic and flooding issues, that would be magnified if the plan were to go forward. A spokesperson for The Rockefeller Group told CNN that it still hopes to develop the site under the designation of ""rehabilitation,"" but that this is ""contingent on the plan the city comes up with."" Another investigation? As word of the allegations spread Saturday, the chairman of the investigative committee tasked with looking into the George Washington Bridge scandal weighed in. Assemblyman John Wisniewski, D-Middlesex, told CNN: ""This certainly has attracted our attention. We need to obtain all relevant facts, confer with our special counsel and determine the committee's best course of action."" Opinion: Is Chris Christie presidential?

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- For 11 years, Pedro Zapeta, an illegal immigrant from Guatemala, lived his version of the American dream in Stuart, Florida: washing dishes and living frugally to bring money back to his home country. Pedro Zapeta, an illegal immigrant, managed to save $59,000 while working as a dishwasher for 11 years. Two years ago, Zapeta was ready to return to Guatemala, so he carried a duffel bag filled with $59,000 -- all the cash he had scrimped and saved over the years -- to the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. But when Zapeta tried to go through airport security, an officer spotted the money in the bag and called U.S. customs officials. ""They asked me how much money I had,"" Zapeta recalled, speaking to CNN in Spanish. He told the customs officials $59,000. At that point, U.S. customs seized his money, setting off a two-year struggle for Zapeta to get it back.  Zapeta describes how he lost his money » . Zapeta, who speaks no English, said he didn't know he was running afoul of U.S. law by failing to declare he was carrying more than $10,000 with him. Anyone entering or leaving the country with more than $10,000 has to fill out a one-page form declaring the money to U.S. customs. Officials initially accused Zapeta of being a courier for the drug trade, but they dropped the allegation once he produced pay stubs from restaurants where he had worked. Zapeta earned $5.50 an hour at most of the places where he washed dishes. When he learned to do more, he got a 25-cent raise. After customs officials seized the money, they turned Zapeta over to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The INS released him but began deportation proceedings. For two years, Zapeta has had two attorneys working pro bono: one on his immigration case, the other trying to get his money back. ""They are treating me like a criminal when all I am is a working man,"" he said. Zapeta's story became public last year on CNN and in The Palm Beach Post newspaper, prompting well-wishers to give him nearly $10,000 -- money that now sits in a trust. Robert Gershman, one of Zapeta's attorneys, said federal prosecutors later offered his client a deal: He could take $10,000 of the original cash seized, plus $9,000 in donations as long as he didn't talk publicly and left the country immediately. Zapeta said, ""No."" He wanted all his money. He'd earned it, he said. Now, according to Gershman, the Internal Revenue Service wants access to the donated cash to cover taxes on the donations and on the money Zapeta made as a dishwasher. Zapeta admits he never paid taxes. CNN contacted the U.S. Attorneys office in Miami, U.S. Customs and the IRS about Zapeta's case. They all declined to comment. Marisol Zequeira, an immigration lawyer, said illegal immigrants such as Zapeta have few options when dealing with the U.S. government. ""When you are poor, uneducated and illegal, your avenues are cut,"" he said. On Wednesday, Zapeta went to immigration court and got more bad news. The judge gave the dishwasher until the end of January to leave the country on his own. He's unlikely to see a penny of his money. ""I am desperate,"" Zapeta said. ""I no longer feel good about this country."" Zapeta said his goal in coming to the United States was to make enough money to buy land in his mountain village and build a home for his mother and sisters. He sent no money back to Guatemala over the years, he said, and planned to bring it all home at once. At Wednesday's hearing, Zapeta was given official status in the United States -- voluntary departure -- and a signed order from a judge. For the first time, he can work legally in the U.S. By the end of January, Zapeta may be able to earn enough money to pay for a one-way ticket home so the U.S. government, which seized his $59,000, doesn't have to do so.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson pleaded ""no contest"" to kicking in his ex-girlfriend's bedroom door, but a domestic violence charge against the rapper was dropped Monday. A plea agreement with the Los Angeles city attorney allows Jackson to avoid jail while serving 36 months of unsupervised probation, according to a statement from the city attorney. Jackson, 37, was accused of one count of domestic violence and four counts of vandalism for allegedly ransacking the bedroom during an argument at Daphne Joy's Los Angeles condo last June. ""The agreement called for Mr. Jackson to plead no contest to a single count of misdemeanor vandalism, which deals with the door of the apartment that was damaged and owned by the landlord,"" attorney Scott Leemon said. Jackson does not admit guilt with a ""no contest"" plea, but it is considered a conviction, a spokesman for the city attorney said. WIth the conviction, Jackson must perform 30 days of community service, attend a year of domestic violence counseling, pay $7,100 restitution for damaged property and comply with a stay-away protective order from Joy, the city attorney said. He'll have to appear in court on February 28, 2014, to show the judge his progress in completing the classes and community service. Joy had a three-year relationship with Jackson and the two have a child together, according to a spokesman for the actress-model. ""During an argument, Jackson allegedly began destroying the female's property,"" the city prosecutor's office said in a written statement in July. ""Allegedly when the female locked herself in her bedroom, Jackson kicked open the bedroom door and kicked her, causing an injury."" Police found broken chandeliers and furniture throughout the home. The bedroom closet was ransacked, with clothes thrown all over the floor, and there was a broken television and lamp, the prosecutor's office said. Without the plea agreement, Jackson could have faced up to five years in jail and $46,000 in fines if convicted on all five counts. CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.","A domestic violence charge is dropped in the plea deal .

"(CNN) -- In contrast to the 2002 farewell summit between President George W. Bush and outgoing Chinese President Jiang Zemin at Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, this week's talks between Barack Obama and Xi Jinping in California mark the first time in history that a U.S. president will host a series of informal meetings with a new Chinese leader. While issues such as North Korea, cybersecurity and the economy will likely dominate their discussions, what really matters is whether Xi and Obama can establish a trusting personal relationship that will help both leaders overcome stark policy differences. As charismatic leaders who view themselves as transformational figures, what better way to start the conversation than to outline their aspirations and plans for resolving pressing domestic matters? Both Xi and Obama are finding themselves at political crossroads that will define their subsequent days in office. Both need to solve a confluence of structural problems while confronting cynical constituencies that can easily turn on them. For Obama, dealing with a seemingly intractable partisan divide in Washington is hard enough. A series of recent bureaucratic problems has made his burden worse, resulting in what some have referred to as his ""second term blues."" For Xi, an apparent turn to conservatism has the potential to bring his erstwhile reform-minded political honeymoon to an untimely end. Luckily, each leader has the opportunity this week to talk with one of the few counterparts in the world who can empathize with the magnitude of the issues. In his first few months as president, Xi has worked to give the Chinese government a face-lift, trying to contain corruption and construct a sense of nationalism by offering his people something they aspire to: the Chinese Dream, or what Xi has described as the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the opportunity to realize a middle-class lifestyle. As Xi pursues these aspirations, he should join Obama in exploring similar issues that are hindering both countries -- a growing divide between the rich and poor, persistent post-graduate unemployment, housing bubbles, food safety concerns, immigration (or internal migration for China) reform, health care reform and tax reform. If Xi is to be successful in confronting these issues, it will be difficult to do so without political reform. In China, dissent has been growing on college campuses, where academics have received recommendations instructing them not to speak about seven sensitive issues: universal values, freedom of the press, civil society, civil rights, past party mistakes, crony capitalism and judicial independence. Whether such official guidelines persist will determine if there is hope for an open and intellectually dynamic political environment that can accommodate socioeconomic changes. As a former professor of constitutional law, Obama is uniquely situated to address the importance of Chinese political reform and constitutionalism. Obama needs to stress that avoiding intellectual discussion of political issues doesn't make them go awayâ€”it only pushes such discussion into less structured arenas, and China has seen how that has turned out in the past. As the first black president, Obama can also candidly and respectfully articulate America's lessons from the civil rights movement and its firm commitment to democracy, human rights, media freedom and the rule of law, which the United States believe to be fundamental to the long-term stability and prosperity of any country. Some might argue that discussion of China's much needed political reform would set Obama and Xi on course for a contentious relationship. In fact, it would help remind Xi that he can seize this moment to stand on the right side of history and turn back from the conservative path before he squanders the reform-minded political capital he has built over his first productive months in office. Instead of focusing solely on specific issues like national security and economic rebalancing, Obama and Xi have an opportunity to set the stage for a deeper, more candid and more cooperative Sino-American relationship by crafting a shared vision of the future and drawing on the common needs and desires of the Chinese and American people. Only by talking about their domestic challenges and areas for improvement will they realize the potential fruits to be born out of such cooperation. And only when such unity of purpose is realized will China and America be able to work together and tackle the economic and security issues of our time. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cheng Li and Ryan McElveen.","President Obama and President Xi Jinping are meeting for informal talks .

"(CNN) -- A moving graph at the bottom of the CNN screen during Tuesday night's presidential debate measured the reactions of uncommitted voters in the swing state of Ohio, and it seemed to bear out the theory that negative campaigning draws negative voter reactions. Analysts say undecided voters don't like negative attacks, from either side. Nearly every time one candidate threw a jab at the other, the voter reaction dipped measurably. The dips were minor for small digs but slipped further if a candidate continued criticizing his opponent. For instance, reactions of both men and women voters slid into negative territory when Republican Sen. John McCain said that trying to nail down Democratic Sen. Barack Obama's tax policies is like ""nailing Jell-O to the wall.""  Watch the criticism and the reaction » . Similarly, the reaction line took a dive when Obama discussed McCain's votes in the Senate against alternative fuels.  Watch the graph go down at this point » . Such negative reactions are typically seen in voters who are undecided, said Merle Black, professor of politics and government at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. ""They don't like negative campaigning,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter whether it's one side or the other."" But while each candidate saw dips when criticizing his opponent, voters' reactions were more positive when each began talking about specific plans and ideas regarding the national economy, the war in Iraq, the environment and other issues. Voters are ""worried about real issues,"" Black said. ""They want the candidate to address that. ... That's what the voters are interested in. They know it's a big mess out there, and they want to know what the alternatives are.""  See scenes from the debate » . With less than a month to go before the general election, McCain's campaign said before Tuesday's debate that he planned to ""take off the gloves."" In addition, both campaigns have launched negative advertising campaigns against the opponent in an effort to win over undecided voters. The stakes for McCain are high, as most polls show him trailing Obama. ""When you are down to crunch time and it's win or lose, you throw niceties out the window,"" Bruce Vanden Bergh, a professor of advertising at Michigan State University, told CNN before the debate. And on CNN's ""American Morning"" on Wednesday, Ben Jones, a former Democratic representative from Georgia, said, ""At this point, it appears because the McCain campaign is behind, they think that's the only shot they got left is to bring (negativity) -- but when they do those negative campaigns and negative attacks, it also brings them down. ""So it really doesn't do any good, and people are sick and tired of it."" Both McCain and Obama took numerous opportunities in Tuesday's debate to point out the other's voting record. Obama noted that McCain voted against a program to provide government health insurance for children.  Watch Obama slam McCain on health insurance » . For his part, McCain pointed to Obama's vote on a pork-laden energy bill.  Watch the dig and the reaction » . Both instances caused voters' reaction to head toward negative territory. The only voters who like to hear the jabs, Black said, are ""the strong partisans. They like to see the other candidate, the other side, criticized."" But those voters, he noted, have already made up their minds, and in criticizing their opponent, candidates are ""not persuading anybody that's persuadable."" Meanwhile, pointing out opponents' shortcomings is a risky strategy, analysts have said, and one that could easily backfire on a campaign. ""Whenever the campaign takes a negative turn, independent voters notice, and they'll punish the candidate that takes it too far,"" John Avlon, author of ""Independent Nation: How Centrists Can Change American Politics,"" told CNN prior to the debate. However, voters on some level have come to anticipate a certain level of criticism and jabs in a debate, which may be one reason that campaigns persist with negativity even though voters are known to dislike it, experts said. ""Both of them are probably irritated at each other and want to get the digs in,"" Black said. ""It just kind of goes with the territory.""

"(CNN) -- North Korea warned Friday it would launch a military strike against the South if Seoul goes ahead with live-fire drills near Yeonpyeong Island over the next five days, North Korea's state-run KCNA reported. South Korea ""should take a prompt measure to stop the planned provocative maritime shelling from Yeonpyeong Island,"" the report said. The Korean People's Army ""will deal the second and third unpredictable self-defensive blow at them to protect the inviolable territorial waters of"" North Korea ""as it had declared before the world."" The Russian Foreign Ministry also warned against the drills in a meeting Friday among Deputy Foreign Minister Alexi Borodavkin, U.S. ambassador John Beyrle and Lee Younho, the South Korean ambassador to Moscow, according to a statement posted to the ministry's website. The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff announced Thursday that the exercises will take place in the seas southwest of Yeonpyeong Island between December 18 and 21. The South previously announced military exercises for this week. Tensions mounted between the Koreas on November 23, when North Korea shelled the island, which lies in South Korean territory. The attacked killed two marines and two civilians and injured 18 people. The North has accused the South of provoking the attack because shells from a South Korean military drill landed in the North's waters. According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Boradavkin reminded the U.S. and South Korean ambassadors at Friday's meeting that the November drill resulted in casulties and that canceling the drills was critical to avoid further possible escalation of tensions. Last month's attack was the first direct artillery assault on South Korea since 1953, when an armistice ended fighting. The U.S. military has said it is concerned that South Korea's exercises could spark an uncontrollable clash with the North, but the State Department said the exercises are not meant to be threatening or provocative. ""What we worry about, obviously, is if that is misunderstood or if it's taken advantage of as an opportunity,"" Gen. James Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday at the Pentagon. ""If North Korea were to react to that in a negative way and fire back at those firing positions on the islands, that would start potentially a chain reaction of firing and counter-firing.""","NEW: Russian Foreign Ministry urges United States and South Korea to call off military drill .

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. On average, voice actors make $47,000. If you have a highly recognizable voice, you'll probably get paid more. Every now and then, I come across an occupation that makes me wish I was in a different line of work. Don't get me wrong, I love my job -- but some professions really seem too good to be true. Recently, for example, I came across an article about a man named Julian Jones, whose job is essentially as a babysitter -- to all-star athletes. ""Part companion, part publicist, part chaperone and part guardian angel, Mr. Jones, who lives in Las Vegas and works for a pair of casino owners, specializes in setting up elaborately arranged outings for athletes where every detail from transportation and tickets to the members of the entourage is premeditated,"" writes Hannah Karp of The Wall Street Journal, in an article about Jones. He got the gig when he met Gavin Maloof, who with his brother Joe, owns the Sacramento Kings and the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas. Maloof first offered Jones a job as a personal assistant -- entertaining athletes was not in the job description. ""Nowadays, armed with a complimentary suite at the casino, the keys to Mr. Maloof's Sacramento home and an allowance for first-class travel, Jones is free to perform his wingman role almost exclusively,"" Karp writes. ""'We pretty much let J.J. go on his own,' says Mr. Maloof."" While not everyone has the luck of meeting millionaires as Las Vegas, Nevada, parties, there are other (more realistic) cool jobs out there. Don't believe me? Take a look at these 10 awesome jobs: . 1. Cruise director . Cool factor: Aside from getting to travel the world on a cruise ship, these guys have the ability to make or break a cruising experience. They are essentially the face of the cruise line, planning and coordinating daily activities and excursions for passengers, on and off shore. If you love making plans and organizing activities but don't have strong sea legs, have a go at event planning. Average annual salary: $21,219* . 2. Doll doctor . Cool factor: We all had a favorite doll or something similar when we were young -- and we were devastated when something happened to it. Doll ""doctors"" can make that desolation go away for little ones. They examine dolls to determine the extent of damage and the repairs needed, and then restore them to the best condition possible. If you like to sew and/or fix things but aren't into dolls, look into careers in textiles, apparel and furnishings. Average annual salary: $24,413 . 3. Foley artist . Cool factor: Foley artists use whatever they can find to create and record the noises used to make the sound effects in films, like heavy footsteps, rolling thunder or creaking doors. If you're more interested in mixing music than sound effects, look into a job as a sound engineering technician. Average annual salary: $55,959 (sound technicians) 4. Food critic . Cool factor: What could be cooler than getting paid to taste everything from gourmet dishes to bar food -- for free -- and then publishing your opinion for others to read? If you're more interested in getting paid per word than per calorie, try your hand as a reporter. Average annual salary: $58,704 . 5. Pet psychologist . Cool factor: When a veterinarian can't diagnose an animal's condition, a pet psychologist might be called to diagnose the issue. If, for example, if a dog has been acting different since he came home from boarding, the psychologist works with the owner to resolve the issue. Not to be mistaken for a pet trainer, this occupation requires a high level of education and training. If you'd rather help animals through medical treatments than behavioral remedies, look into what it takes to be a veterinarian. Average annual salary: $19,220 (animal behaviorist) 6. Route setter . Cool factor: These folks are like modern-day trailblazers; they change the routes in various settings, such as indoor climbing walls, foot trails and running races. Interested in running but not so much in setting the routes? Look for careers in nonprofits and fundraising, which often help put on races. Average annual salary: Unknown . 7. Shoe designer . Cool factor: Shoes are a fetish for millions of men and women around the world -- to be the mastermind behind the look of the cutest/hippest/most unique shoes on the market would be a pretty sweet gig. Not interested in design but love shoes? Try your hand in shoe manufacturing or repair. Average annual salary: $67,247 . 8. Storm chaser . Cool factor: Remember the movie ""Twister""? Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton tempt Mother Nature by chasing life-threatening storms through Oklahoma. While storm chasers aim to track tornados, they also study cloud formations and severe thunderstorms, too. Keep in mind that storm chasing can be very dangerous; if you'd like to pursue storms in a safe environment, check out careers in weather forecasting and meteorology. Average annual salary: $60,968 . 9. Video game tester . Cool factor: For eight hours a day, five days a week, all these folks do is play video games. They repeat levels, games and characters, looking for any bugs and/or glitches in the software. If you're not interested in playing the games, look into designing, developing or programming them instead. Average annual salary: $44,600 . 10. Voice actor . Cool factor: Everyone knew Don LaFontaine, the infamous voice behind thousands of movie trailers, TV advertisements and network promotions. Voice actors also loan their chops to movies and cartoons. Wouldn't it be neat to have your voice be familiar to the whole world? If you'd like a less publicized career in television, look to work behind the scenes in advertising. Average annual salary: $47,000. If you have a highly recognizable voice, you'll probably get paid more. *Salaries according to CBSalary.com . Copyright CareerBuilder.com 2009. All rights reserved.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- With neither Donald nor Shelly Sterling in the room, the trial to see who controls the Los Angeles Clippers began in a California probate court Monday afternoon. The day started with a federal judge sending the case back to the state court, denying the claim by Donald Sterling's attorneys that his privacy rights had been violated with the release of his medical records. With a July 15 deadline looming for the closing on Shelly Sterling's sale of the team to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, the probate trial began with some drama. When her lead attorney Pierce O'Donnell was told he could call his first witness, he summoned Donald Sterling. Sterling was not there and the trial was briefly halted. One of Donald Sterling's attorneys, Gary Ruttenberg, told reporters the move was a ploy meant to bring attention to his absence. After the delay, Ruttenberg requested the chance to make an opening statement, during which he declared: ""The NBA wants to get rid of my client."" But Bert Fields, a lawyer for Shelly Sterling, said they were very anxious to hear from her husband. ""We want to bring him to court and let him, finally, have a little cross-examination,"" Fields said. ""He's accusing his wife of fraud. Nonsense."" Sterling will appear in court Tuesday. Shelly Sterling came to the court Monday morning as the case was being ruled on by the federal judge but she left before the trial began in the state court. With Donald Sterling absent, O'Donnell called Dr. Meril S. Platzer, a neurologist who examined Donald Sterling. The judge overruled his lawyer's objection to the doctor testifying. Shelly Sterling is trying to sell the NBA team to Ballmer for $2 billion. Her husband bought the team, which he says he wants to keep, for about $12 million in 1981. The couple owns the Clippers through a trust, with each spouse being an equal trustee. Shelly Sterling had two doctors declare her husband mentally incapacitated -- and a third doctor agreed with their assessment -- and invoked a provision in the trust that allowed her to be sole trustee. Donald Sterling refused to sign the binding term sheet, so his wife took the matter to probate court. Donald Sterling says his wife didn't have authority to negotiate a deal with Ballmer. Donald Sterling's lawyers have said their client was tricked into medical examinations. They also dispute their client is mentally deficient. Late last month, another doctor found Donald Sterling to be mentally fit, a source with knowledge of the situation told CNN. Bobby Samini, a lawyer for Donald Sterling, said he looked forward to his client showing his mental acuity on the witness stand. ""I have absolute confidence that Donald's testimony is going to be very, very telling for everybody who observes it,"" he told reporters. Sterling, 80, has been embroiled in controversy since a recording of a conversation with his friend V. Stiviano surfaced. The recording included a series of racist comments. Sterling's comments, first posted on TMZ, sparked outrage among NBA players, executives and fans. The NBA commissioner fined Sterling $2.5 million and banned him for life from the NBA. Sterling issued a statement last month in which he apologized for the remarks and said his apology was sincere. The contract between Shelly Sterling and Ballmer has a July 15 deadline to close the deal, with a 30-day extension, if needed. The NBA has a meeting the same day at which owners could approve the sale. If the case drags on, the Sterlings face a September 15 deadline from the NBA to sell team. Before the proposed sale was announced, the league had begun proceedings to terminate the Sterlings' ownership rights. Sterlings face probate court trial on NBA's Clippers -- or do they?

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts man pleaded not guilty Wednesday to obstructing the investigation of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, federal prosecutors said. Khairullozhon Matanov, 23, of Quincy was charged with ""one count of destroying, altering, and falsifying records, documents, and tangible objects in a federal investigation, specifically information on his computer, and three counts of making materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements in a federal terrorism investigation,"" according to the U.S. attorney's office for Massachusetts. Matanov pleaded not guilty to all four counts, his lawyer Edward Hayden told CNN. Hayden maintains that the indictment was based on ""unsubstantiated allegations."" Matanov agreed to voluntary detention Wednesday because he doesn't have a home and his family is out of the country, Hayden said. A hearing was set for July 15, according to the U.S. attorney's office. Authorities say brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev planted bombs at the finish line of the 2013 race. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed during a subsequent manhunt that paralyzed Boston. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to killing four people -- including three killed by the bombings -- and wounding more than 200 others. Matanov is not charged with participating in the bombings, and prosecutors said that Matanov did not know about the bombings beforehand. But about 40 minutes after the blasts, Matanov bought dinner for the brothers, according to the indictment. In the hours and days after the bombings, Matanov contacted and attempted to contact the suspects by phone and saw Tamerlan Tsarnaev at least twice, according to the indictment. Matanov allegedly tried to give away his cell phone to friends and deleted hundreds of videos and documents from his computer. Authorities allege he misled police about the extent to which he knew the brothers. He also hid that he shared the ""philosophical justification for violence"" that the Tsarnaev brothers held, the U.S. attorney's office said last week. If convicted, Matanov faces up to 20 years in prison for the destruction of evidence charge, and eight years for each of the false statement counts.

"(CNN) -- As President Barack Obama vowed Wednesday to help fight the influx of extremists vying for control in Syria's three-year civil war, anti-government fighters reported that jihadists in an eastern village methodically set fire to the homes and farms of those who openly opposed a hardline al Qaeda offshoot. The act of retaliation is the latest in an offensive by the rogue Islamic State of Iraq and Syria to capture rebel-held territory in the oil-rich Deir Ezzour area along the Iraqi border. If ISIS successfully wrests control of the border province, the extremist group notorious for its extreme interpretation of Sharia law is set to feed a comeback campaign across the country by establishing a supply route connecting its bastion in the western Syrian city of Raqqah with its home base in Iraq. Obama outlines foreign policy vision of 'might and right' ""ISIS intends to resurge everywhere,"" Valerie A. Szybala, a Syria analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, tells CNN. ""Deir Ezzour is just the first on the list of priorities because it is rich in oil and because of its strategic importance as a transit between Iraq and Syria."" Other rebel groups unite . To combat the push by ISIS, 12 rebel battalions including al-Nusra Front, a powerful al Qaeda affiliate in Syria, formed the Mujahideen Shura Council in eastern Deir Ezzour, earlier this week. ""We found the only solution is for us to unite against ISIS. So all the battalions that were fighting them united financially, militarily and administratively and now work out of the same operation room,"" Jassem Alkraty, a media activist linked to anti-ISIS insurgent groups, told CNN via Skype from eastern Deir Ezzour. The birth of the alliance followed weeks of brutal clashes between ISIS and al-Nusra Front fighters backed by Islamist insurgents. The fighting forced at least 60,000 civilians to flee, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group. This is not the first time strained rebel fighters have diverted resources away from their primary objective of overthrowing President Bashar al-Assad to repel ISIS aggression. Early this year, a coordinated rebel offensive forced ISIS to either withdraw or tactically secede from much of the country's north. ""At the direct insistence of foreign backers and the West, rebels fought ISIS expecting a lot more support from their allies. The fact that this support did not come through is part of the reason for their return,"" Szybala tells CNN. ""My hope is we can right those wrongs. A lot of the people fighting on the ground have shown they have the will and the desire to stand up against ISIS, but they need resources."" The Obama administration says it's moving closer to finalizing a plan to expand military training and equip moderate Syrian rebels, according to U.S. officials. But with the al Qaeda linked al-Nusra Front leading the fight against ISIS, Syria's allies will face challenges isolating nonextremists from increasingly radicalized opposition factions. 'We are at a critical juncture in our fight against violent extremism and hope that the UK and U.S. can shrug off their fear of supporting us,"" Brig. Gen. Abdulellah al-Basheer, chief of staff of the Supreme Military Council, said in a letter to The Times this week adding, ""A failure to actively support the FSA now will lead to ISIS' successes internationally."" Infighting creates humanitarian crisis . Violence erupted last month when ISIS launched a surprise attack on the border town of Al-Bukamal, then stormed into the Deir Ezzour countryside. ISIS set off car bombs and executed rebel fighters in a terrifying campaign that left dozens dead, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ""The warfare is never-ending and the towns nearby are facing a serious humanitarian crisis and are very afraid. Rumors spread like wildfire and families are constantly scared their village will be the target of the next massacre,"" Alkraty tells CNN. ISIS has pushed through much of the east and set up checkpoints along the Euphrates River across from the provincial capital of Deir Ezzour. The city remains under the control of anti-ISIS militias but is vulnerable to attacks from Syrian troop positions to the north. ""Residents are very afraid of ISIS and scared of the horrible stories about them,"" Khalid al-Taha, a spokesperson for the opposition-run local committee in Deir Ezzour, said. ""Plus we have near daily shelling from the regime, so life is very, very hard."" Rebels claim the fate of Deir Ezzour might soon parallel the ISIS-controlled city of Raqqah, where human rights groups report public executions, the forced disappearance and torture of opponents and even mock crucifixions, but Szybala says the ultraextremists do not have the resources to rule another population center. Al Qaeda central recognizes and supports al Nusra Front's fight against the government in Syria, but in an unprecedented move earlier this year, the group's general command disowned ISIS and blamed it for intrarebel fighting that has killed more than 3,300 people, a number reported by SOHR in April. ""We started this revolution for freedom,"" al-Taha says, ""so we cannot accept any another organization coming and imposing its rules on us."" Islamic militants claim American carried out suicide attack .","The rogue Islamic State of Iraq and Syria has alienated even other al Qaeda groups .
It's feared that ISIS could wrest control of a key border province with Iraq .

"Washington (CNN) -- Amid the cacophony of political analysis and reporting around the midterm elections, here's a user's guide -- our effort to slice and dice the story lines for what you need to know from now till November. 1. Return of the establishment Republicans: But will it mean GOP victories in the fall? The tea party's candidates have failed to catch on in Kentucky, North Carolina and Mississippi, to name a few. Absent any onetime witches in the field, there's no guarantee that the tea party faithful will turn out in droves to push Sen. Mitch McConnell over the finish line to re-election in November. 2014 primary calendar . 2. Wherefore art thou, independents? Are they disenfranchised conservatives or middle-of-the-road voters who are thoroughly ticked off at Washington? Either way, will they vote? 3. Minimum wage/minimum gain? Will Democrats get a minimum return on the time they have invested on the issue? President Barack Obama continually pushed for an increase in the minimum wage throughout the year. He's been taking it to voters outside the Beltway. But is the issue doing what Democrats are hoping for and energizing their base? 4. Boehner and the border: Will House Speaker John Boehner take immigration reform to the floor? Will he buck his caucus' most conservative members? And if so, will it have any effect on who turns out to vote? 5. Embrace the Act: Can Democrats effectively run on the parts of the Affordable Care Act that the public likes? Will the public still like any of it as the year wears on? Who'll run away from it, and who'll run on it? And with polls showing almost half of the country now wanting to tweak it instead of throwing it out, can running on the anti-Obamacare theme gin up the conservative base as much as some in the GOP expect? 6. The 2016 GOP field: Fired up and ready to go ... but to where? 2014 midterms: What's at stake . 7. Meet the Clintons: Where will they campaign? Will they focus their efforts on early primary states, or will they leapfrog directly to the 2016 purple states? And when they're campaigning, will we hear them selling the Obama years or laying out their rationale for Hillary's expected 2016 run? 8.

Will there be a ""higher"" turnout in Alaska and Oregon, where voters will get the chance to legalize pot? Could those states keep the Senate blue? 15.

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russian authorities said Friday they have decided to move Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, a jailed member of the Russian punk rock collective Pussy Riot, to a different prison. The news came only hours after her husband, Pyotr Verzilov, told CNN that his wife had gone back on a hunger strike to protest being returned to Penal Colony No. 14, a grim prison camp in Mordovia. Russia's Federal Service for the Enforcement of Punishments (FSIN) has not yet said where Tolokonnikova, who was sentenced to two years after being found guilty of hooliganism, has been taken. One of her relatives will be informed of her new location no later than 10 days after her transfer to the new prison camp, it said. A tweet posted by an art group linked to Verzilov, called Voina, said: ""Flash and micro victory: FSIN reported that Nadezhda Tolokonnikova will be moved to another prison."" Tolokonnikova, 23, was sent to Mordovia last year for her part in a performance of a ""punk prayer"" critical of Vladimir Putin -- then the Prime Minister, now the President -- at a Russian Orthodox cathedral. 'Slave labor' claims in Mordovia prison camp . She now has less than six months left to serve. But on September 23, she declared the conditions at the prison camp to be intolerable and began a hunger strike. She has been hospitalized since September 27, when she became so weak that doctors ordered that she be placed in the penal colony's medical ward. She carried on the hunger strike for four more days and suffered complications because of the length of the protest, her husband said. Verzilov warned then that Tolokonnikova would resume her hunger strike if she was sent back to Penal Colony No. 14 and conditions did not improve. In a lengthy letter last month to the news site Lenta (a translated version was published in London's The Guardian), Tolokonnikova described ""slave labor"" and unsanitary conditions in which women work through sickness and injury up to 17 hours a day and are beaten -- or worse -- for failing to complete their duties. Tolokonnikova wrote that her life was once threatened and other prisoners tell her she is not beaten only because of the celebrity her case has brought her. Others are not so lucky, she said. Prison authorities told state news agency RIA Novosti then that Tolokonnikova was blackmailing them for denying her request for special treatment. Maria Alyokhina, another convicted member of Pussy Riot, went on a hunger strike earlier this year, protesting conditions in a different remote prison camp. She drew attention and won concessions. CNN's Alla Eshchenko reported from Moscow and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","NEW: Russian authorities decide to move Nadezhda Tolokonnikova to a different prison .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Lawyers representing Muslim Brotherhood members in a jailbreak case that includes former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy called Saturday for the judges to be changed. As has been the case in previous proceedings, Morsy appeared in the courtroom from inside a soundproof glass box, a requirement he rejected last Sunday as a ""farce."" He and a number of leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, which continues to back him, were present in the courtroom where they face prison-break charges stemming from the January 2011 uprising. On Saturday, one of the defense lawyers said the glass enclosure should either be removed or the defendants should be given a sign language expert -- and time to learn sign language -- before proceedings continue so they can communicate with their lawyers in private, as the law requires they be allowed to do. The three-judge panel's refusal led to the request that they be changed. Typically, another judge or panel would look into the demand for change, though it was not clear Saturday which judicial district would do so. Judge Shaaban El-Shamy adjourned the case until Monday. ""The glass dock is to humiliate the defendants,"" Mohamed Selim El-Awa, the lead attorney, said Sunday. ""This is unprecedented in the world."" A glitch in the sound system that had allegedly made it difficult for defendants Sunday to hear what was going on in the courtroom appeared to have been repaired by Saturday. During Saturday's proceeding, defense lawyer Kamal Mandour filed a complaint against what he described as crimes committed by the military leaders of last year's coup, in which the nation's first democratically elected president was deposed. As Mandour ticked off the coup leaders' alleged crimes -- among them obstruction of the constitution and staging the coup -- Morsy added ""and for killing over 3,000 people"" in sit-ins. Mandour continued, ""and for the ongoing killings in the face of peaceful protests."" He called for an investigation into the crimes ""to stop the ongoing bloodshed."" Another defense lawyer, Mohamed El-Damaty, called for the case against Morsy and the others to be dismissed ""because it was borne out of the womb of the counterrevolution that happened on July 3."" That was a reference to Morsy's removal last year from the presidency and by Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Most of the leaders of the January 25, 2011, revolution that toppled longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak and led to Morsy's election the following year, especially Islamists, ""have been thrown into prison with fictitious evidence,"" El-Damaty said. He called the continuing legal wrangling an attempt to uproot the Muslim Brotherhood and to ""uphold the foundation of the counterrevolution and military dictatorship."" But the prosecution objected to the arguments, describing them as political and irrelevant to the case. The defense attorneys' arguments were all about ""the country, the political scene and targeted messages,"" the prosecutor said. ""The prosecution has no right to object,"" responded defense attorney Mohamed Abu Leila, who requested that the judges overseeing the case be changed. It is his right to say things that the prosecutor may not understand, but which could prove useful later in the case, he said. Morsy himself was allowed to speak twice. ""Farces take place in your presence,"" he said in remarks directed to the judge that were referring to a recording leaked to the news media of what he had thought was a private conversation between him and his lawyer. He maintained that he remains the country's legitimate president and called upon the people of Egypt to continue ""their peaceful revolution."" ""People are aware of the truth behind the coup,"" Morsy said. Morsy repeated his earlier assertion that the court proceeding was unconstitutional, describing it in English as ""null and void."" Morsy has been charged with inciting the killings of political opponents and organizing a 2011 jailbreak by members of his then-banned Muslim Brotherhood. Morsy, the former head of the Brotherhood's political arm, won office in 2012. Shortly after he was elected, he resigned from the Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice party in an effort to show he would represent all Egyptians. But he was ousted in a coup a year later amid widespread protests against his rule, with opponents accusing him of pursuing an Islamist agenda and excluding other factions from the government. Morsy and other Brotherhood leaders were rounded up after the coup. The Brotherhood had long been suppressed during the 29-year rule of Mubarak. But it emerged as the most powerful political force in Egypt after the popular revolt that toppled Mubarak in 2011. Rights groups and other pundits say the military-backed government that replaced Morsy has returned to the authoritarian practices of Mubarak, if not worse.","Glass enclosure should be removed or defendants allowed to learn sign language, lawyers say .

"(CNN) -- There's a new group of travelers in town -- and it hardly matters which town you're talking about. Russian travelers are increasingly booking trips abroad, and hotels and touring companies are working overtime to win their patronage. In 2012, Russian tourists spent $43 billion abroad -- making them the fifth highest-spending segment of the travel industry. Last year, nearly 40 million Russians traveled overseas (only 8 million journeyed in 2006). That number is likely to expand, and quickly; Russians are the world's second-fastest growing group of tourists. The supercharged growth can be attributed to a steadily growing middle class (projected to rise 16% between now and 2020), and the fact that access to the world beyond the former Soviet borders is still fairly novel. Read this: Can airlines make money from their maps . ""The Russian visitor explosion has been so fast that perhaps some hoteliers still haven't quite picked up on it,"" says Matt Walls, vice president of Hotels.com -- a booking site that recently released a global survey on Russian tourists. ""Now is the time (for them to do so), because unless you can cater to the needs of Russian customers, they'll go and stay somewhere else,"" he adds. The InterContinental Hotel Group is one company that invested early and heavily in their Russian guests, introducing Russian-language websites, call centers and mobile apps. ""Russia is one of the largest outbound markets in the world -- equivalent to a country like France, but growing almost as fast as China,"" says Matt Luscombe, the InterContinental's senior vice president of sales and marketing. Read this: Landing at the world's busiest airport . Catering to new market . According to Visit Britain, hotel managers in London -- one of the top ten destinations Russians visit when on vacation -- have started introducing amenities to deal specifically with this segment. At the Jumeirah Carlton Towers, special menus cater to Russian tastes and Russian-language shopping guides help guests navigate the city's department stores. At the Corinthia Hotel, Russian-speaking butlers have been added to the staff. ""If you asked me three years ago, I'd say we didn't have any Russian guests. Now, we have some every single weekend and weekday,"" notes Alvaro Rey, general manager of London's InterContinental Park Lane. ""This being a new market, you have to start adapting to them: What are their needs? How should we handle them? What types of room do they like? How do they like to be addressed?"" For the companies that do succeed in winning over this newest segment, the rewards can be sizable. Russian guests tend to spend 20% to 30% above the average room rate, according to Hotels.com, and they can rack up a sizable food and beverage bill. ""On the plus side, Russians are seen as high-spending. They bring a lot of cash with them,"" says Walls, who adds that Russians tend to enjoy a drink or two. ""The bar bill benefits quite significantly when Russians are traveling.""","Nearly 40 million Russians traveled overseas last year .

"(CNN) -- If the U.S. military were to intervene in an increasingly chaotic Libya, it would most likely be part of a NATO action in which Libyan bloodshed has reached a humanitarian crisis, analysts said Thursday. As reports emerged Thursday about deadly clashes between leader Moammar Gadhafi's forces and anti-government protesters in the town of Zawiya near Tunisia, analysts highlighted how Gadhafi has already pledged to fight a rebellion to martyrdom. Military intervention ""is something which I hope doesn't happen, but it looks as though at some point that it should happen,"" said Simon Henderson, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ""What's an acceptable number of civilian deaths? I don't know. Choose your figure,"" Henderson said. ""At the very least, instead of having a casualty list certainly in the hundreds, possibly in the thousands, we don't want a casualty list numbering in the tens of thousands, or 100,000 or so."" After 10 days of protest, Gadhafi has lost control of the eastern portion of a country he has ruled for 42 years, and analysts portrayed him as a dictator desperately clinging to power. Members of his government have defected, and in a sign of growing international pressure, Switzerland ordered Thursday that Gadhafi's assets be frozen. ""You've got to assume the worst about Moammar Gadhafi,"" Nicholas Burns, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School and former under secretary of state between 2005 and 2008, told CNN. ""With his back to the wall, he's going to go out in a blaze of vicious attacks."" North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense chiefs ought to be holding discussions about ""not taking action but preparation"" for the Libyan crisis, said Robert Kagan, a Mideast expert who worked in the State Department under President Ronald Reagan. ""I don't think anyone is talking about immediate military actions now,"" Kagan told CNN, especially as 167 U.S. citizens are waiting on a ferry to leave Libya. U.S. officials have said all options were under consideration, including sanctions and enforcement of a no-fly zone, to try to keep the Libyan government from attacking protesters. Ibrahim Sharqieh, deputy director of Brookings Doha Center in Qatar, interpreted that statement as indicating that military force remains a possibility. ""In my opinion, it's still premature to talk about U.S. military intervention in Libya at this point, but we should not eliminate it completely,"" Sharqieh said. Meanwhile, the Department of State recommended Thursday that the 6,000 or so Americans in Libya ""depart immediately due to the potential for ongoing unrest."" Libya's disintegration, the latest Middle East uprising that has already toppled autocracies in nearby Tunisia and Egypt, poses greater impacts to Europe than the United States, analysts said. Africa's largest oil producer, Libya exports 1.5 million barrels a day, mostly to Europe, which relies on the country for 10% of its energy needs, analysts said. Meanwhile, refugees fleeing Libyan violence are expected to land in such European countries as Italy, analysts said. On Thursday, President Barack Obama spoke with the leaders of France, Italy and the United Kingdom on coordinating an international response to the crisis in Libya, the White House said. In separate phone conversations with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and British Prime Minister David Cameron, Obama ""expressed his deep concern with the Libyan government's use of violence, which violates international norms and every standard of human decency, and discussed appropriate and effective ways for the international community to immediately respond,"" the White House statement said. While some critics say the Obama administration has been slow to react to Libya, the statement said Thursday's discussions were to ""coordinate our urgent efforts to respond to developments and ensure that there is appropriate accountability."" ""The leaders discussed the range of options that both the United States and European countries are preparing to hold the Libyan government accountable for its actions, as well as planning for humanitarian assistance,"" the White House statement said. Complicating any consideration of military intervention is how American and European armed forces have been strained from repeated deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq for almost 10 years, analysts said. Libya's factions and tribalism would make an intervention perilous, said Nathan Hughes, director of military analysis for the global intelligence firm Stratfor of Austin, Texas. ""It's not clear what a post-Gadhafi Libya looks like,"" Hughes said. ""It's a very messy situation. It would be a very difficult situation to jump into militarily. ""There are no geographical boundaries. There are soft demographic, cultural and tribal boundaries. To get enmeshed in that without understanding the local culture ... it would be a pretty tough spot to put troops in,"" Hughes added. ""Once the writing is on the wall that Gadhafi is going to go likely to go, the incentive for the various tribal factions and other factions within Libya is to maneuver to make sure they have a place in whatever comes next."" Were NATO to send armed forces into Libya, the rest of the Arab world wouldn't protest much, the analysts said. ""I don't think they would have any problem with this. I would suspect that the Arab world would support this,"" Sharqieh said. Added Henderson: ""On day one, they would probably think it's a good idea. On day two, come back and ask...me.""","Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has pledged to fight the rebellion to martyrdom .
Analysts say U.S. military intervention is a remote thought for now .
But if bloodshed spirals out of control, U.S. may be likely to join a NATO intervention ."
"London (CNN) -- Rupert Murdoch is the last of a dying breed: An old-fashioned press baron with ink running through his veins, a hefty checkbook, and a hunger for the next big story. Now aged 83, he has spent the past half century turning a business that began with one local Australian newspaper into a massive multimedia empire which spans the globe and includes TV, online, film and print interests. The phone-hacking scandal forced him to close the British tabloid that was his pride and joy, News of the World, and for a time even appeared to jeopardize his global empire, valued by Forbes at $9.4 billion. It led the powerful businessman to submit himself for questioning by British politicians, where he declared: ""This is the most humble day of my life."" But Murdoch bounced back from the crisis, and he remains at the helm of his global empire. In 2013, News International, the UK subsidiary of Murdoch's News Corp. was rebranded News UK, while News Corp. itself split into two separate entities. News Corp. is now focused on publishing while 21st Century Fox encompasses television and film assets. This month, Forbes estimated the net worth of Murdoch and his family at $14.5 billion, adding that stocks from the two companies had boosted his worth by more than $2 billion in the past year. The same year, Murdoch filed for divorce from his third wife, Wendi Deng. Deng had grabbed headlines when she lunged to defend her husband from a pie-throwing intruder at a 2011 parliamentary hearing in London, earning her the sobriquet ""tiger wife."" But speculation about the state of the couple's relationship had swirled for months before Murdoch's spokesman confirmed the divorce. One tweet fittingly declared that Murdoch had gone ""from tabloid boss to tabloid prey."" The media mogul was kept on the edge of the limelight from October 2013, when former employees went on trial for alleged phone hacking. The newspaper business is in Murdoch's blood. Born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1931, he was one of four children -- the only son -- of a celebrated journalist and his debutante-turned-philanthropist wife. His father, Keith Murdoch, was a reporter who exposed the horrific conditions experienced by Anzac troops fighting at Gallipoli in World War I, and went on to manage a large newspaper company. ""I was raised in a newspaper family by a father who believed that the newspaper was among the most important instruments of human freedom,"" Murdoch declared in his 2008 Boyer Lectures. His mother, Elisabeth, was inspired to devote her life to ""good works"" as a schoolgirl. At the time of her death in 2012, aged 103, she remained a supporter of more than 100 charities, and enjoyed an almost regal status in Australia. Murdoch was studying at Oxford when his father died in 1952. Mentored -- like his father -- by press baron Lord Beaverbrook, he learned his trade as a reporter in Birmingham, England and as a Â£10-a-week sub-editor at Beaverbrook's Daily Express in London before returning home to take charge of the family business. ""I found myself a newspaper proprietor at the age of 22,"" Murdoch said in 2008. ""I was so young and so new to the business that when I pulled my car into the lot on my first day, the garage attendant admonished me, 'Hey sonny, you can't park here.'"" Despite his youth, the new boss of the Adelaide News took to the job like a duck to water, quickly getting embroiled in a newspaper war -- the first of many -- with local rival the Adelaide Advertiser. ""It cost a great deal,"" he said. ""But it taught me that with good editors and a loyal readership, you can challenge better-heeled and more established rivals -- and succeed."" He was soon looking to expand the company: After buying up other local papers across the country, in 1964, he set up Australia's first national newspaper, The Australian, and in 1969, moved overseas to purchase his first UK paper, News of the World, shortly followed by The Sun. The sensationalism and sex on the pages of some of his papers provoked shock and anger among his competitors on Fleet Street, and earned Murdoch a number of less than complimentary nicknames. As Ian Hislop, editor of British satirical magazine Private Eye, told CNN: ""[We have] referred to Murdoch as the Dirty Digger throughout his long career, and it's not an accident; he does dig up dirt and then puts it in papers and sells it."" His hunger for the latest scoops -- and his willingness to pay for them -- have ensured massive sales figures, but have also caused controversy over the years, from Christine Keeler's kiss-and-tell over the Profumo scandal, to the ""Hitler Diaries"" (later revealed to be fakes) to O.J. Simpson's ""If I Did It"" book. That desire to be first with the big news has led some to question his methods -- even before the phone-hacking scandal. ""He ran close to what might be considered journalistic ethics,"" said Lou Colasuonno, former editor-in-chief of the New York Post, which Murdoch took over in 1976. ""I'm not saying he broke the law, I'm not saying he did anything illegal, but I am saying he's aggressive in getting stories."" Print unions . That aggression was evident in the mid-1980s when Murdoch, by then the owner of London's Times and Sunday Times papers, broke the stranglehold of the unions on the country's print industry. After months of plotting, the media titan switched his operations from Fleet Street to Wapping, in the east end of London, and from hot metal to computerized systems overnight, forcing hundreds of printers out of work. ""He was the man who tamed the print unions so that newspapers became incredibly profitable,"" said Martin Dunn, former deputy editor of the Sun and News of the World. Those profits were plowed into Murdoch's growing Fox network of TV and film interests in the United States, helping to create the corporate behemoth that is News Corp., which now also owns the influential Wall Street Journal, America's largest circulation daily. The thrice-married father-of-six Murdoch has long been at the center of a frenzied succession debate -- something the current scandal only complicates. His oldest four children -- daughters Prudence and Elisabeth, and sons Lachlan and James -- all have a say in the running of the company. His youngest daughters Grace (born 2001) and Chloe (born 2003), with Wendi Deng, are both said to have a financial share in News Corp. Famously hands-on, Murdoch has never shied away from getting stuck in -- whether tracking down a story, or dictating the political direction of his papers. ""If I see things in the paper which I think are incorrect, I'll certainly point it out and say 'so-and-so made a mistake here,' or 'this wasn't as good a report as was in the opposition newspapers,'"" he told the makers of BBC documentary ""Who's Afraid of Rupert Murdoch?"" in 1981. ""I ... have the right to insist on excellence."" On the same program, Robert Spitzler, former managing editor of the New York Post said Murdoch's role went beyond commenting and suggesting. ""Rupert wrote headlines, Rupert shaped stories, Rupert dictated the leads of stories,"" he said. ""Rupert was everywhere."" In a 1968 television interview, Murdoch admitted that he enjoyed the power his position gave him, but -- in remarks that now seem more relevant than ever -- insisted: ""We have more responsibility than power, I think. ""A newspaper can create great controversies, stir up arguments within the community ... can throw light on injustices, just as it can do the opposite, can hide things and be a great power for evil."" But even those who may be considered his enemies recognize Murdoch's business acumen.

"Potomac, Maryland (CNN) -- Almost 50 years to the day that President John F. Kennedy in his inaugural address asked Americans to get involved by doing good, family and friends bade farewell Saturday to R. Sargent Shriver, who helped lead the way. Former President Bill Clinton referred to Kennedy's famous line, ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."" Shriver, Clinton said at a funeral Mass in Potomac, Maryland, gave the perfect example of public service, both at the bright-eyed beginning of the 1960s and the cynical end of the decade and in the early 1970s. ""He showed up every day and found joy in life,"" Clinton said of Shriver, first director of the Peace Corps, and a force -- with his late wife -- behind the Special Olympics. Shriver was Kennedy's brother-in-law. The message of unconditional love, faith and service were themes throughout the service at Our Lady of Mercy. There also were moments of humor, including references to Shriver's hugs and hearty handshakes. ""I am asking you to be apostles of Sarge,"" son Anthony Shriver told political and entertainment luminaries and ordinary people alike. Shriver, 95, died Tuesday after suffering from Alzheimer's disease for years. His wife of 56 years, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, died in 2009. Anthony Shriver encouraged people to wake up each morning with boundless energy and a commitment to change the world, fight poverty and be a friend. Vice President Joe Biden, first lady Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is married to Shriver's daughter, Maria, were in attendance. Bono and fellow Irish singer Glen Hansard performed ""Make Me a Channel of Your Peace,"" a song from the Prayer of St. Francis. In part it says, ""Grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled, as to console; to be understood, as to understand; to be loved, as to love. For it is in giving that we receive. It is in pardoning that we are pardoned, and it is in dying that we are born to Eternal Life."" Singer Wyclef Jean led the hand-clapping congregation in singing Psalm 98. Vanessa Williams performed ""Soon and Very Soon"" following tender intercessions and remembrances by Shriver's grandchildren, who mentioned Shriver's smile, service and love of baseball. The service concluded with Bob Dylan's ""Forever Young,"" with Stevie Wonder playing harmonica . During his homily, Cardinal Donald Wuerl cited Shriver's work with many initiatives. ""He fought injustice and poverty his whole life,"" said Wuerl. ""He worked with religious leaders and everyone to speak out for peace and economic opportunity for the underprivileged."" Wuerl recalled Shriver attending a Mass for people with special needs. ""Sargent Shriver already demonstrated then the effects of age and illness, but he was there,"" the cardinal said. In his remarks, Biden credited Shriver with leading a rally that helped him, at 29, earn an unlikely U.S. Senate victory in Delaware in 1972. Shriver's four other children also gave remembrances. Maria Shriver told the standing-room-only audience that her father taught his sons to be gentle, loving men. ""He'll never be far from me,"" she said. Timothy Shriver said some dismissed his father as too idealistic, too cheery and too public in his Catholic faith. But the younger Shriver said he appreciated his father's spirit and zest for life. ""I hope you, too, can carry a little Sarge in you,"" he told mourners. Mark Shriver talked of his father's faith and commitment to the church. Sargent Shriver wrote a letter to the family before his illness, saying he was looking forward to meeting God. ""I expect to get to eternity first"" and prepare the way, he wrote. Robert ""Bobby"" Shriver recalled his ""complete humiliation"" upon being arrested on marijuana charges when he was a teen. His father offered support, and gave no criticism or moralizing, Bobby Shriver recalled. An unidentified woman standing in the back of the church apparently fainted at one point during the funeral. William Kennedy Smith, a physician and nephew of President Kennedy, came to her aid and helped assist her outside. After overseeing the Peace Corps launch in the early 1960s, Shriver went on to serve subsequent presidential administrations. He kept up his activism throughout his life, becoming a chief architect of President Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty and later heading the Special Olympics founded by his wife. The Peace Corps is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. More than 200,000 volunteers have served in 139 countries on issues such as education, public health and environmental preservation. Shriver's entree into the Kennedy family was Joseph P. Kennedy, the family patriarch, who hired him to run a business venture in Chicago. The work led to an introduction to Eunice Kennedy, whose siblings included JFK, Robert F. Kennedy and Ted Kennedy. After his brother-in-law John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Shriver was tapped by Johnson to launch the White House Office of Economic Opportunity, which was made up of a handful of anti-poverty programs. He also served as Republican President Richard Nixon's ambassador to France before becoming Democrat George McGovern's running mate in 1972, as the two unsuccessfully tried to unseat Nixon. Shriver also served as chairman of the board of Special Olympics International, which Eunice Kennedy Shriver founded in 1968. The organization sponsors sports training events around the world for people with intellectual disabilities. Shriver was born in Westminster, Maryland, and graduated from Yale University. He was also long active in the Roman Catholic Church. The Shrivers had five children, including Maria Shriver, the former first lady of California.

"Washington (CNN) -- Counterterrorism drone strikes have killed four Americans overseas since 2009, the U.S. government acknowledged for the first time on Wednesday, one day before President Barack Obama delivers a major speech on related policy. In a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, Attorney General Eric Holder said the United States specifically targeted and killed one American citizen, al Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, in 2011 in Yemen, alleging he was plotting attacks against the United States. The letter provided new details about al-Awlaki's alleged involvement in bomb plots targeting U.S. aviation. Holder also said the Obama administration was aware of three other Americans who had been killed in counterterrorism operations overseas. Holder said Samir Kahn, Abdul Rahman Anwar al-Awlaki and Jude Kenan Mohammed were not targeted by the United States but he did not add more details about their deaths. The letter represents the first U.S. admission that the four were killed in counterterror strikes even though their deaths had been reported in the media. Read Holder's letter . Abdul Rahman Anwar Al-Awlaki was the 16-year-old son of the al Qaeda cleric and was killed in Pakistan about two weeks after his father's death. Khan produced the English-language magazine Inspire for al Qaeda's affiliate in the Arabian Peninsula, which included bomb-making instruction. He was killed alongside the elder al-Awlaki. Mohammed, who was once on the FBI's Most Wanted list, was indicted in July 2009 as part of a North Carolina-based terror ring. He was charged with plotting to murder, kidnap or maim persons overseas and provide material support to terrorists. Mohammed was never arrested and for a time reportedly was living in Pakistan. The Justice Department did not say when he was killed or provide any details. Obama will deliver long-promised remarks on Thursday at National Defense University and will speak at length about the policy and legal rationale for how the United States takes action against al Qaeda and its affiliates, including the use of drones, according to a White House official. Obama will discuss the administration's rationale for why those strikes are legal and necessary, the official said. Targeting Americans with lethal force in counterterror operations overseas was a controversy that flared publicly during confirmation hearings for CIA Director John Brennan earlier this year. Senators aggressively sought the administration's legal reasoning for those operations. By the numbers: Drones . Some lawmakers were critical of the practice and questions were raised about whether drones might ever be used against U.S. citizens suspected of terrorism who were on American soil. Holder said Obama directed him to release the latest details, which had been classified ""until now."" He said the unprecedented disclosure was made as a way to build on Obama's commitment in his State of the Union Address earlier this year to ""continue to engage"" with Congress on counterterror efforts and to ""ensure that they remain consistent with our laws and values."" Holder noted in one of his own speeches last year he had made it clear the United States would only use lethal force against an American citizen ""who is a senior operational leader of al Qaeda or its associated forces, and who is actively engaged in planning to kill Americans."" He also said no American would be targeted unless he or she posed an imminent threat and could not be captured. The senior al-Awlaki was believed by U.S. authorities to have inspired acts of terrorism against the United States. It was said his facility with English and technology made him one of the top terrorist recruiters in the world. He was considered the public face of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. But Holder said in his letter that it ""was not his words that led the United States to act against him"" but his ""direct personal involvement"" in the ""planning and execution"" of terror attacks against the United States that ""made him a lawful target."" Opinion: 9 myths about drones and Gitmo . For instance, Holder said al-Awlaki ""planned a suicide operation"" for Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to blow up a U.S.-bound jetliner. Holder noted al-Awlaki directed Abdulmutallab to detonate his bomb, which was hidden in his underwear, only when the jet was over U.S. soil. The plot that ultimately involved a Delta Air Lines flight bound for Detroit on Christmas Day in 2009 failed. The letter also provided new details about al-Awlaki's alleged involvement in a 2010 plot to blow up U.S.-bound cargo planes with explosives hidden in printers. Holder said al-Awlaki was so involved he even participated in the development and testing of the explosives used in the plan that was foiled. Calling the decision to use lethal force ""one of the gravest our government"" can face,"" Holder said the operation targeting al-Awlaki received ""exceptionally rigorous"" legal review and additional policy screening by the administration. Congress was also briefed on the possibility of targeting the al Qaeda figure and informed once the decision was made in 2010. In his letter Holder said Obama approved a policy document this week that ""institutionalizes the administration's exacting standards and processes for reviewing and approving operations to capture or use lethal force against terrorist targets outside the United States and areas of active hostilities."" Obama focuses on drones, Gitmo . CNN's Jessica Yellin contributed to this report.","Attorney General Eric Holder acknowledges toll in letter to Senate chairman .

"(CNN) -- A natural gas leak in the Gulf of Mexico left a four-mile wide ""rainbow sheen"" on the water's surface south of Louisiana, the Coast Guard said, but the owner of the well said it expects the leak to be plugged sometime Wednesday. Houston-based Talos Energy said on Tuesday the gas flowed from a well that it was in the process of abandoning. The leak occurred while it was trying to permanently plug the well, located about 74 miles southeast of Port Fourchon, Louisiana. Talos said it evacuated all five staff members from the platform and shut down the two other working wells there. It notified the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement and the Coast Guard and began a spill response. Massive tar mat dug up off Louisiana coast, 3 years after spill . Along with the gas (escaping into the air), the well leaked about six barrels of a liquid form of raw natural gas, or about 252 gallons, the company said. It expects the mixture to evaporate quickly. The Coast Guard and federal environmental officials flew over the leak and found natural gas still flowing from the well, with a rainbow sheen visible on the surface measuring more than four miles wide by three-quarters of a mile long, the Coast Guard said. Gulf oil heartbreaker for bellwether fish . The wellhead is on a platform above the water's surface, according to a spokesman for Talos Energy. There is a concern that the gas leak could have a toxic effect on marine life. ""Toxic gases will damage the bodies of fish that come into contact by damaging their gills and causing internal damage,"" said Jonathan Henderson of the Gulf Restoration Network, an environmental advocacy group in New Orleans. ""Marine species in the Gulf are more vulnerable when water temperatures are high and when oxygen concentrations are low like they are now."" Talos said the well is older and in a field developed in the 1970s. By 1998, the well was producing mostly water at a low-flowing pressure, so the company was plugging and abandoning it. The company said it believes the age of the tubing may have contributed to the leak, though the Coast Guard said the cause is still under investigation. The Coast Guard said the well is owned by Energy Resource Technology Gulf of Mexico. Talos acquired the company earlier this year. Coast Guard, BP end Gulf cleanup in 3 states .

"(CNN) -- The Internet can get pretty overwhelming sometimes. If you're like me, there are days when it feels like you can't stay on top of the endless stream of media. It seems impossible to discover the best content in all that noise. But today offers a rare opportunity to slow down. It's a chance to reflect on 2012's biggest news events and see some of the best first-person stories, photos and videos that came out of those moments. We're revealing the 3rd Annual iReport Awards nominees -- 36 examples of citizen journalism at its finest. The nominated stories paint an intimate portrait of the topics and events that dominated the news cycle last year. A 10-year-old boy describes what it's like to live with autism. Beautiful photographs capture the sense of wonder among a crowd watching a Mars Curiosity rover broadcast. A personal essay recounts the horror of escaping the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater where a mass shooting took place. Journalism has been forever changed -- I'd argue for the better -- thanks to the fact that people can interact with media organizations and share their opinions, personal stories, and photos and videos of news as it happens. This year's nominated iReports are prime examples of how participatory storytelling can positively affect the way we cover and understand the news. People around the world posted more than 100,000 stories on CNNiReport.com last year. Out of that, 10,789 were vetted for CNN, which means they were fact-checked and approved to be broadcast on CNN TV or featured on CNN.com. And over the past few months, the iReport team and a panel of CNN producers sorted through all those stories to select 36 nominees in six categories: Breaking News, Original Reporting, Compelling Imagery, Personal Story, Commentary and, new this year, In-depth Storytelling. Finding and curating notable stories is an essential component of iReport's success. The contributions we approve on a daily basis are backed by CNN reporting, and we love nothing more than helping those stories reach an even wider audience. The iReport Awards -- now in their third year -- give us a chance to celebrate those extraordinary efforts of the citizen journalists who produced them. This year, for the first time ever, we'll also honor examples of standout citizen journalism and participatory storytelling that happened outside of iReport in a special section we're calling Excellence on the Web. Those honorees will be revealed along with the iReport Award recipients on May 14. Just as notable as the stories themselves, though, are the people behind them. While some of the nominees are aspiring journalists or filmmakers, many are regular people who simply felt compelled to share their stories with the world. They include Adele Raemer, an English teacher living along the Gaza Strip, who shared her feelings of fear and frustration after rocket attacks between the Palestinian territories and Israel ended a cease-fire. Her first-person take on the conflict offers more emotion than any news report could. And when the Newtown, Connecticut, school shootings left people all over the U.S. and world struggling to find words to cope with the tragedy, Richard Huffman reacted through action instead. The retired police officer cut up his National Rifle Association membership card on camera, in a simple yet powerful protest. These are just a few of the incredible iReporters nominated in the 3rd Annual Awards. I'm proud to note that this year's nominees represent some of the highest-quality stories we've honored yet, and I look forward to continuing the tradition of celebrating standout citizen journalism in years to come. I hope you'll take time today to explore the nominated stories. Enjoy the break from the Internet craziness -- I promise it will still be there when you return. How can you participate? Good question. Go check out the nominees, and make your pick for the Community Choice Award.","We're proud to reveal the nominees for the 3rd Annual iReport Awards .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's former security chief testified that he worried at times that the singer might overdose on drugs, but he didn't think he was an addict. Michael LePerruque, who traveled with the pop icon for three years a decade ago, returns to the stand Monday for more testimony in the wrongful death trial of Jackson's last concert promoter. AEG Live called LePerruque as a witness in an effort to show jurors that Jackson was a secretive drug addict, making it impossible for its executives to know his life was in danger as he prepared for his comeback tour. Michael Jackson's mother and three children are suing the promoter, contending the company is liable in his death because it negligently hired, retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death. LePerruque, however, spoke glowingly of Jackson and after his first day of testimony last week he sought out Katherine Jackson to give his former boss's mother a hug. He was hired as the chief of Jackson's travel security team after he retired from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, where he served as a deputy for 22 years. Part of his training involved recognition of when someone was under the influence of drugs, he said. Jackson estate denies allowing expert to help AEG Live . Jackson called him between 20 and 30 times from his hotel room ""in the middle of the night,"" LePerruque testified. ""His speech would be very slurred. There would be a lot of mumbling, and I wouldn't be able to comprehend what he was saying."" He would go to Jackson's room many of those nights to check to make sure he was alright, he said. He appeared to be intoxicated, he said. ""I think he was just lonely and wanted to have somebody to talk to."" Under cross examination by Jackson lawyer Deborah Chang, LePerruque said Jackson's intoxication appeared to be consistent with someone drinking alcohol and taking sedatives to sleep. Did he think he was addicted to drugs? ""I wouldn't be able to say that he was addicted to those,"" he answered. The security chief said he would sometimes notice empty wine bottles from the hotel room's minibar, but he never saw drugs. He also never witnessed Jackson take medications, he said. He described a scary incident in 2001 when Jackson's children dialed 911 for help when they found their father passed out in the hallway of their suite at a Disney World hotel in Orlando, Florida. Paris and Prince, then just 3 and 4 years old, were ""crying, saying they couldn't wake up daddy,"" he testified. Jackson woke up after LePerruque performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and shook him, he said. Paramedics found no signs of a drug overdose, he said. ""It was my concern that, yes, he may overdose,"" LePerruque said. LePerruque said he never confronted Jackson about his drug use because he ""didn't want to put him on the defensive."" To do so might have created a barrier, he said. ""I wanted to be able to be close to him to monitor him to protect him."" The incidents of slurred speech and incoherent late night phone calls did not happen over the entire time LePerruque worked with Jackson, he said. Bad news hurt Jackson's earning potential, witness says . Jackson ""fought very, very hard not to be on the prescription medications,"" LaPerruque testified. He told of one conversation in which Jackson told him he was not going to use drugs again. ""Do I seem clear?"" he said Jackson asked him. ""I just want you to know that I'm going to stay this way, that I'm not going back to the way I was."" Their late night talks revealed to the guard that Jackson had trouble getting to sleep, a problem that would eventually lead to his death. He told him he couldn't sleep because his brain wouldn't stop creating music. ""He said that as an artist he always had a tune in his head, different melodies, and he wasn't able to stop it,"" La Perruque said. ""It was always constant going through his brain. The coroner ruled that Jackson died of an overdose of propofol, which Murray told investigators he was using to treat the singer's insomnia. The incidents in which Jackson appeared to be under the influence of alcohol and drugs became more frequent after the broadcast of a documentary based on Martin Bashir's extensive interviews with him. LaPerruque said Jackson was ""very devastated"" by what he thought was the betrayal of trust he had with Bashir. Child molestation charges were filed in Santa Barbara County, California, after the broadcast. LaPerruque said he never believed the criminal charges against Jackson were true. If he suspected he was molesting children he would be the first to slap handcuffs on him, he said. ""I came out in full support of him,"" LaPerruque said. Jackson was acquitted on all charges after a trial. LaParruque called Jackson ""very down to earth,"" saying he was proud to have worked for him. ""There were times there were difficulties, but for the most part it was a pleasure working for him,"" he said. He noted that one problem Jackson had was keeping up with his cell phones. He lost 27 of them, he said. The wrongful death trial begins its 15th week in a Los Angeles courtroom Monday. The judge projected the trial will last until the middle of September.

"Washington (CNN) -- More than 20,000 pounds of beef have been recalled by a California company amid worries the meat is linked to two cases of salmonella, a federal food safety agency said. Beef Packers Inc., based in Fresno, California, recalled 22,723 pounds of ground beef products produced on September 23, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in a statement. The labels on the beef include the establishment number ""EST. 31913,"" the agency said. The beef was repackaged at a distribution plant in Arizona, then sold under different retail brand names, the agency said. The agency's statement did not identify brand names. The products were sold in Arizona and New Mexico, said Mark Klein, spokesman for Cargill Inc., which owns Beef Packers, Inc. Consumers in those states should check with stores where they purchased meat to determine if they bought the recalled beef. Investigators have found an association between the meat and two Arizona people who have the ""Salmonella Newport"" strain, the Food Safety and Inspection Service said. That strain is resistant to many commonly prescribed drugs, increasing the risk of hospitalization or ineffective treatment, the agency said. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis -- the bacterial foodborne illness caused by the salmonella infection -- are diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever. Additional symptoms may be chills, headache, nausea and vomiting that can last up to seven days. Cargill spokesman Klein said the company is cooperating with the government. ""We take these matters seriously which is why we have initiated the recall and have cooperated with the government,"" Klein said in an e-mail to CNN.","Ground beef products were sold in Arizona, New Mexico .

"(CNN) -- Terrorist groups such as Boko Haram prey on girls because they fear them, Malala Yousafzai told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Wednesday, adding her voice to the outcry over the mass kidnappings of Nigerian girls. Malala, the Pakistani girl who made a miraculous recovery after being shot in the head by the Taliban, said women are targeted by those who fear a society in which women are empowered. Boko Haram has kidnapped hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls, an act that has become the focal point of a worldwide social media campaign demanding their return. The Malala Fund is launching a Nigerian girls education campaign around the issue. The 16-year-old human rights advocate first spoke up about the kidnappings last week. ""When I heard about girls in Nigeria being abducted, I felt very sad, and I thought, 'my sisters are imprisoned now,'"" Malala said. ""The girls in Nigeria are my sisters and its my responsibility that I speak up for my sisters."" Boko Haram are extremists who don't understand Islam, she said. The religion, she says, calls for empowerment through education, not a snuffing of it. ""They should go and they should learn Islam, and I think that they should think of these girls as their own sisters. How can one imprison their own sisters and treat them in such a bad way?"" she said. Everyone should speak up for the kidnapped girls, she said. In a photo released on social media, Malala holds a sign reading #BringBackOurGirls, joining the chorus of social media activity repeating the same demand. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has been under fire over accusations the government initially ignored and then later downplayed the abduction of the girls. Jonathan has also accepted an offer of U.S. military support in the search for the girls. Why hasn't the rescue effort produced results?","Malala Yousafzai spoke with CNN's Christiane Amanpour .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea has fired 25 short-range rockets from its east coast into open water, in what appears to be a ""provocative"" action, a South Korean Ministry of National Defense spokesman said Sunday. ""We evaluate it as a firing demonstration in response to the joint drill between South Korea and the U.S. We are currently additionally analyzing its intention,"" said spokesman Kim Min-Seok, warning, ""North Korea should halt any actions that can stir military tension and create uneasiness to the neighboring countries."" South Korean officials said earlier that the North had fired only 10 rockets. The rockets appear to be FROGs, which stands for ""Free Rockets Over Ground."" They were developed in the Soviet Union before the advent of missiles, Kim said. ""It does not have a guidance system and is (a) free-fall system. North Korea had developed it in the '60s,"" the spokesman said. Earlier Sunday, South Korea said the rockets appeared to travel about 70 kilometers into the Sea of Japan, according to defense officials who asked not to be identified by name as a matter of security protocol. Such actions have drawn criticism from South Korea and the West. The U.S. State Department said it's aware of the reports of rocket launches by North Korea and is closely monitoring the situation. ""We once again call on North Korea to refrain from provocative actions that aggravate tensions,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. But North Korea has defended the series of short-range launches it has carried out in recent weeks. ""It is justifiable self-defense behavior for us to conduct these military exercises in order to preserve peace in the region and to protect the safety of our people and our country,"" the government said, according to state-run media.","NEW: South Korea says North fired 25 rockets in ""provocative"" act .

"Slovyansk, Ukraine (CNN) -- We were on a rough track surrounded by fields of wheat and barley when the little blue Lada came into sight. The car lurched towards us, kicking up a trail of white dust. Both vehicles stopped. Within 20 miles of Slovyansk, drivers routinely quiz each other for information on the road ahead -- the risks and roadblocks. And then the car, barely the size of a Mini and at least 20 years old, disgorged its occupants: no fewer than eight people, three generations of the Goma family. They had fled the shelling in Slovyansk, a city in eastern Ukraine held for two months by pro-Russian separatists and now under persistent shelling and mortar fire from Ukrainian forces. But after a week sleeping in tents in a forest, battered by thunderstorms, they just wanted to go home -- to a city without electricity, gas or running water. We followed them along rutted tracks and lanes on a twisting route into the city, probably the only way in or out. The Ukrainian army has blocked the main roads around Slovyansk, although President Petro Poroshenko has promised to create 'green corridors' to help civilians escape the fighting. Waved through a couple of separatist checkpoints, they finally made it. Compared to a month ago, Slovyansk seemed half-empty, the city's remaining residents looking drawn and frightened. The thud of artillery and chatter of gunfire echoed around apartment blocks. Jagged shards of glass lay everywhere, the remnants of windows blown out by mortar fire or shells. The roof of a gas station hung precariously, twisted by what appeared to have been a direct hit. There were a few charred vehicles, some small craters. 'No electricity, no water' When the Gomas arrived at a rundown apartment block, the neighbors were surprised to see them back. Who would return to this? They asked. But Tatiana Goma was just relieved her home was still there. ""Of course I'm worried to be here but home is home. There is no electricity and no water but at least it's better than living in tents in the woods,"" she told us after unpacking her few belongings. ""We had nowhere to stay,"" Tatiana said -- and people elsewhere were reluctant or unable to provide shelter. She knew of only four friends who had left. They had gone to Kharkiv, a city to the north, but had not been welcome. Katya Goma said she was giving tranquilizers to her children -- age ten and two -- to calm them down. But they were already beginning to recognize the difference between various weapons. An old man wandered past. Was there any water here? He asked. There wasn't. Try the fountains, someone suggested. Others said they were using buckets to collect water from lakes on the outskirts of town. Pro-Russian separatists, in various uniforms but all armed, wandered the deserted squares or careered through the streets on scooters, assault weapons slung over their shoulders, weaving past downed power cables. But there were fewer of them than before. Most, it seemed, were on the outskirts of town in defensive positions. The office of the self-declared mayor, Vyacheslav Ponomarev, had lost its revolutionary brio. In fact Ponomarev was nowhere to be found. A statement attributed to the military commander of the separatists in the Donetsk People's republic, Igor Strelkov, and carried by the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS said: ""The so-called people's mayor Ponomarev was removed from office for activities which are incompatible with the objectives of the civil administration."" Call for negotiations . Following the killing of an aide to Denis Pushilin, the self-declared mayor of Donetsk, in the city at the weekend, there is growing speculation here of dissent among the separatists' ranks -- though its leadership accused Kiev of being behind the murder. Alexei, a man in his fifties got off his bicycle to talk to us. This had gone on too long, he said. ""They need to negotiate, they should somehow settle this. Or the Ukrainian government should say: 'That's it. We're bombing. Run away.'"" The support among some townspeople for the separatist groups that seized the town's administrative and security buildings early in April seemed to have given way to a weariness, a yearning for an end to the uncertainty and the constant threat of bombardment. No-one could be sure who had fired the mortar that had wrecked an apartment building and sprayed the wall of a school with shrapnel. Maybe it was poor targeting by separatists who had been using the cover of a church to fire at Ukrainian positions -- or equally poor targeting by the army. Those who have basements spend much of the evening sheltering; they said the worst of the fire comes after 8pm. Others have no basement to flee into. One man said that when the bombing started he and his family would hide in the corridor of their house, away from the windows, for hours on end. They couldn't go into the kitchen or bathroom. Thunder, rocket fire . As we reached the bus station, a furious summer thunderstorm erupted. The potholes quickly filled with brown water, the thunder cracked -- or was that another round of rocket fire from somewhere? Galina Sergeyeva, a middle-aged woman with a look of resignation on her face was taking shelter, hoping against hope that she would be able to get home. She had nothing good to say about Poroshenko. ""We call him bloody Petro,"" she said. ""A lot of people have died but no-one is talking about it. They should pull the army back,"" she said. Katya, an elderly woman in a flowing blue dress and clutching two shopping bags sat on a bench nearby. She had braved the journey from a nearby village to Slovyansk to collect her pension. But the bank, she told us, had been destroyed. Now she had to get home. Suddenly, a puppy emerged from one of her shopping bags. She had found it and was taking it home. As the downpour continued, the patter of rain occasionally interrupted by bursts of machine gun fire in the distance, she gave the puppy some milk -- before traipsing away across the puddles in search of a ride home. We found her at a roadblock an hour later, standing among bronzed separatists whose position was overlooked by Ukrainian heavy armor. The puppy was at her feet. We made room for the pair of them and dropped them off at her home in a village just a few miles from Slovyansk -- a picture of rural tranquility compared to the beleaguered city.

"(CNN) -- Barack Obama ran for president in 2008 on the ""audacity of hope,"" but ""audacious"" is hardly the first word that comes to mind in describing American politics these days. Paralysis? Check. Polarization? Check. Small ball? Check. In a column after a trip to Singapore in November, Thomas Friedman wrote: ""(T)he country that showed the world how to pull together to put a man on the moon and defeat Nazism and Communism, today broadcasts a politics dominated by three phrases: 'You can't do that,' 'It's off the table' and 'The president didn't know.' "" In my view, at least, the further we fall the higher the potential for rising again. We cannot continue to muddle through, because muddling through now means falling further and further behind. Our greatest strength as a nation has been our capacity for perpetual renewal. As Doris Kearns Goodwin shows in her splendid book ""The Bully Pulpit,"" we faced similar challenges of corrupt government, excessive concentration of power and a denial of equal opportunity to the majority of our citizens at the end of the 19th century. The progressive movement, born initially out of the Republican Party but ultimately drawing supporters from both parties, rose to the occasion. That change was fueled by a vibrant press and an entire set of new ideas that accompanied new technologies. Big ideas about how to organize our government and ourselves, how to structure our economy, how to reform our educational system and our working conditions. We need a similar set of ideas today. That's why the think tank and civic enterprise I lead, New America, is trying to shift the national conversation toward a set of big ideas as blueprints for change. Two big ideas strike at the heart of who we are as a nation and what we offer our citizens. Rachel Black, Reid Cramer and Aleta Sprague call on America to ""restore the second-chance economy."" The American dream has always been one not only of upward mobility, but of the ability to fall and rise again. Millions of Americans came to this country to reinvent themselves; in the 19th and early 20th centuries, they could escape the stigma of bankruptcy or even a criminal conviction by heading out to the frontier. Yet while ""fail early and often"" is a recipe for success in Silicon Valley, it is a death sentence, sometimes literally, for the majority of Americans. Credit histories and criminal records now follow citizens everywhere and forever, always accessible online. We need to end institutional practices that currently double down on disadvantage, while at the same time helping our citizens build assets and provide social insurance that will cushion them through the inevitable ups and downs of life. The idea of a second-chance economy should be built into the social contract between Americans and their government. In return for paying taxes, participating in elections and obeying the law, citizens should expect the government to invest in an infrastructure of both competition and care that enables them to reach their full potential as workers and human beings. In the 21st century, that should start with providing every citizen with universal high-speed Internet -- as Alan Davidson and Danielle Kehl put it -- ""for everyone. Everywhere. Really."" Big ideas for a new America expand well beyond government policy, however. Consider the future of American manufacturing, which Michael Lind and Joshua Freedman argue lies in ""servitization,"" the transformation of goods into packages of physical products attached to a stream of services. A John Deere tractor, for instance, comes with an onboard computer that can steer itself, adjust levels of fertilizer, seed and water, and, most importantly, send a continual flow of data back to a 24-hour service line that will in turn tell farmers how to increase productivity and when they need preventive maintenance. That service line, in turn, is staffed by information and analysis service providers, a huge and expanding category of jobs that will process data coming from virtually every ""product"" we use in our lives and work, all now connected to each other in the Internet of things. At the same time, technology shouldn't become an impediment to the American birthright of the pursuit of happiness. We can increase productivity and at the same time, increase leisure. Other big ideas worth considering include a smart plan to fix our political system: The answer for elections dominated by big donors is to make everyone a political donor. Mark Schmitt and Zephyr Teachout outline the basic logic of this approach: ""If politicians have a broad base of support, they will be far less dependent on the 0.01 percent, even if the big spenders still exist."" If the remedy for bad speech is more speech, our classic defense of the First Amendment, then the remedy for distorted democracy is more democracy. Finally, consider the state of American education. Amid all the justified hand-wringing over our schools, a revolution is about to take place in higher education. Physical campuses will transform or combine with virtual platforms that provide lifelong learning from multiple sources with measurable outcomes. The key to this transformation, as New America's Amy Laitinen points out, is to start measuring education in terms of learning rather than time. The idea involves the redefinition or even abolition of ""the credit hour."" We currently award degrees based on how many ""credits"" a student receives for a course, which in turn measures how much time he or she has sat in a classroom every week, whether that time was spent listening to the professor or surfing the Web. But students today, many of whom can expect to live to 100 or more, will learn what they need and want to know over a lifetime, in physical school, their workplaces, online and in the school of life. They will be able to prove that they have in fact gained the knowledge they need through a variety of certification measures, all of which will replace ""credits"" as we know them. It is so easy to be cynical, to think that talk is cheap and ideas are easy to promote but impossible to implement. I have a different view. Inspiration cannot take flight without ideas to power it. With inspiration, by contrast, comes a vision of genuine change and the energy, faith, commitment, determination and persistence to make it happen. If our politics are small, it is because our imagination is impoverished, strangled by the belief that nothing big can happen. If we start with ideas -- not just speeches, but real ideas -- the politics will follow.","Anne-Marie Slaughter: U.S. politics paralyzed, polarized and in ""small-ball"" mode .
She says that shouldn't prevent us from pushing ahead with big new ideas .

"London (CNN) -- One year ago, Lord Justice Leveson delivered his damning report on the ""culture, practices and ethics"" of the British press. Called into action following the revelations of widespread phone hacking at the best-selling (and now defunct) News of the World tabloid, Leveson concluded that sections of the press ""had wreaked havoc with the lives of innocent people whose rights and liberties have been disdained."" Leveson called for a new form of independent press self-regulation to be overseen by a recognition body established in law to replace the industry-backed Press Complaints Commission (PCC) that had, by that time, been utterly discredited. One year on and the situation is a mess. First, the press barons, including News Corp's Rupert Murdoch and the Daily Mail's Paul Dacre, launched a vicious assault on Leveson's proposals, arguing that any form of statutory regulation constituted the end of ""300 years of press freedom."" This is despite the fact that the press are already subject to multiple forms of statute (including libel and contempt of court) and in receipt of public money via their exemption from sales taxes. This is also despite the fact that Leveson himself wrote: ""[N]ot a single witness has proposed that the Government or Parliament should themselves be involved in the regulation of the press. I have not contemplated and do not make any such proposal."" Under pressure from this sustained campaign of press self-interest, the government, supported by all the main parties, attempted a compromise by enshrining Leveson's recommendations in what was supposed to be a less controversial instrument, a Royal Charter (the same body to which the BBC is accountable), that was signed off late last month. The press responded with another hissy fit, announcing that they would ignore the Charter and instead proceeded to set up their own outfit, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO), seen by some as a PCC Mark 2. We should not have been surprised. Nick Davies, the Guardian journalist who did so much to expose the original phone hacking story, wrote immediately after the publication of Leveson's report of the real danger that the debate will now ""be conducted under the same old rules -- of falsehood, distortion and bullying."" So while we read endless stories about how we now have a ""Ministry of Truth"" and a ""Politicians' Charter"" (despite the fact that IPSO would have members of the Houses of Lords with close connections to the newspaper industry in powerful positions), no one has yet been able to provide a single example of how an oversight body of a self-regulator with no remit whatsoever to impose restraints on journalists will be able, single-handedly, to undermine what is regularly described as our ""raucous"" press. Meanwhile, in a press culture that has allegedly been ""chilled"" in the post-Leveson era, the Daily Mail found the courage to attack the late Ralph Miliband, father of Labour leader Ed Miliband, as a man ""who hated Britain"" (an attack that Miliband Jr. responded to robustly) while the Sun managed to find evidence of 600,000 ""benefit tourists"" in the UK, a claim it quickly had to refute. Even more significantly, we have discovered that our ""raucous"" tabloids love free speech so much that they have accused the Guardian of ""treason"" in exposing the existence of state-sponsored surveillance systems run by the U.S. National Security Agency and GCHQ, its British equivalent. Press power, as Nick Davies predicted, has been effectively mobilized since Leveson released his report last year. This disguises the fact that his recommendations, together with those embedded in the Royal Charter, are rather modest and will not end press freedom or chill investigative journalism. Indeed, there are elements of the Charter that should help to iron out some of the worst examples of intrusion and inaccuracy while access for ordinary people to a low-cost arbitration system might help to prevent some of the most damaging excesses of sensationalist reporting. However, the proposals, as contained in both the Charter and the Leveson Report, fail to tackle the structural causes of the phone hacking crisis: the determination of a highly ideological and competitive press to increase circulation and secure exclusives and influence by any means necessary. Without challenging the underlying conditions that gave rise to the current crisis, the whole regulation debate has been subject to precisely the power relations it sought to investigate and hold to account. Press power has consistently attempted to challenge, undermine and distort proceedings in the hope that things will soon return to normal and that proprietors can once again invite politicians to their yachts and to ride horses with them without a word being said. This reflects some of the weaknesses of the Leveson Inquiry, which heard a vast amount of evidence about the extent of corporate lobbying and intimate relations between media executives and ministers but shied away from making any meaningful changes to media ownership rules that might make individual companies less powerful and therefore politicians less likely to kowtow towards them. The same goes for evidence about police corruption -- many examples were provided to the Inquiry about a ""network of corrupted officials"" but the idea that there was an institutional problem was dismissed. Corrupt organizations, complicit relationships and corrosive systems were therefore simultaneously exposed but also stripped of their systemic character in order to pursue politically pragmatic resolutions. That pragmatism has now fallen foul of the continuing power of the press -- aided, not undermined, by its online presence -- and as we move towards a general election in 2015, there is likely to be even less of an appetite among politicians of all parties to tackle the issue of concentrated media power. It would be a huge mistake to shrug our shoulders and to say that this is simply the result we were always going to get. Time after time, newspaper readers have shown in polls that they trust neither politicians nor proprietors to deliver an ethical and independent press while a substantial majority of the public wants to see action taken to limit the size and influence of the largest media outlets. However, it does seem that, for now, corporate media interests have outmaneuvered those fighting for meaningful change. Leveson confirmed what many people knew to be happening: that politicians, media executives and senior police chiefs were in each other's pockets and that the press serves largely the corporate, rather than the public, interest. There is no reason to think that anything has changed since the report was published and it will require action far beyond that of a public inquiry to tackle the problems that Lord Justice Leveson raised a year ago and that still wait to be adequately addressed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Des Freedman.","One year ago, Lord Justice Leveson delivered his damning report on British press .

"(CNN) -- Looks like we'd all like to live in Mayberry. Fifty years later, we're still watching ""The Andy Griffith Show."" The '60s hit continues to air twice a day in TV Land's weekday schedule, at noon and 12:30 p.m. ET. (TV Land also has a July 4 marathon, Wednesday 8 a.m.-1 p.m. ET/PT; and a weekend tribute to its recently deceased star July 7-8, Saturday-Sunday 11 a.m.-8 p.m. ET/PT.) Andy Griffith created a mighty special place in his small-town TV comedy, which seems to have aired continually every day someplace since it left the CBS network in 1968. When the show ceased production, it ranked as prime-time's No. 1 series, after spending all eight of its network seasons in Nielsen's Top 10. Mayberry was a town so comfortable and calm that Griffith's down-home Sheriff Andy Taylor hardly ever got to do any sheriff-ing. He mostly dispensed folksy wisdom to his motherless son, Opie, rode herd on his jittery sheriff, Barney Fife, and helped his Mayberry townsfolk keep on the straight and narrow and neighborly. What we love about Andy Griffith . Wait. This was TV's No. 1 series -- in 1968? Hasn't the Vietnam era-1968 gone down in history as the year synonymous with social upheaval? Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. were assassinated. The ""generation gap"" widened. Hippies turned on and dropped out. Fists were raised at the Olympic Games. War protests raged. And folksy Andy Griffith drew viewers in staggering numbers. Perhaps it's really not so strange at all. Who wouldn't rather live in the serene Mayberry of ""TV land"" than in Realtown USA, beset by crime, corruption, war, taxes and societal chaos? No wonder ""The Andy Griffith Show"" endures, far beyond the nostalgia for more ""pivotal"" TV landmarks such as ""All in the Family"" and ""Roseanne."" There's even a ""real"" Mayberry, and it continues to draw vacationers. Griffith's hometown of Mount Airy, North Carolina, to this day operates the seven-days-a-week Andy Griffith Museum, filled with the actor's memorabilia, props, video and other attractions. (Be there for September 27-30's annual Mayberry Days!) Come sit a spell, take your shoes off, y'all come back now, y'hear? OK, so we borrowed that last line from ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" theme song. Same difference. In fact, during ""Andy Griffith's"" run of 1960-68, ""Hillbillies"" was twice the nation's top-ranked show. The other years' Nielsen titles went to ""Gunsmoke,"" to ""Wagon Train,"" and (three times) to ""Bonanza."" Which just goes to show how much Americans wanted to be anywhere rather than Here and Now. Those other top series still run on TV, but ""The Andy Griffith Show"" has turned out to be in a class by itself. Did citizens ever really live in idyllic small towns like Mayberry? Maybe we wish we did. Maybe we still want to. What was Connecticut's fictional Stars Hollow, the small-town setting for that 21st-century WB fave ""Gilmore Girls,"" but a more elegantly and literately constructed Mayberry? Everybody knew everybody, and got along, and meant well, and everybody was witty and sophisticated. 'Andy Griffith' theme song also part of Americana . But Americans still seem to crave the more primitive version of Americana, as evidenced by the fact that everybody's favorite episodes of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" are the ones in black-and-white. The show was filmed monochrome its first five seasons, the ones with Don Knotts as Barney Fife. Then when Knotts left the cast for the big screen (""The Incredible Mr. Limpet,"" anyone?), the show transitioned to color and lost much of its charm. We liked Mayberry more as a timeless Everyplace than a DayGlo wannabe. Here's another reason ""The Andy Griffith Show"" endures: It may be TV's first dramedy. There's a laugh track, yes, because it was filmed single-camera, rather than in a studio like most other Desilu-produced series after studio pioneer ""I Love Lucy."" Griffith insisted he wanted to be able to include exterior shots, remembering what the outdoors meant to him as a North Carolina kid. Indeed, what's the first image of the show that comes to mind? The whistling-theme opening credits, when Andy and son Opie are heading out to do some fishin' (no ""g"" here). The ""drama"" quotient amped up, too, as Andy's initial portrayal of Sheriff Andy Taylor as a country bumpkin (watch the series' backdoor pilot as a 1960 episode of ""Make Room for Daddy"") quickly evolved into the town sage -- a dispenser of common-sense wisdom to the quirky characters who crossed his path in search of rational justice and cogent advice. Don Knotts won the Emmys as wacky deputy Barney Fife. Andy Griffith gained legend as the straight man who made it all possible. Think of Andy Griffith this way: Can you imagine a 300-channel TV universe without ""The Andy Griffith Show"" airing someplace every day? Enough said. We all need our little slice of Mayberry. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Diane Werts.","Diane Werts notes ""The Andy Griffith Show"" was No. 1 in 1968 .
In an era of upheaval, Americans turned to Mayberry, she says .

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- A book detailing a culture of corruption in Kenya is making booksellers and government officials uneasy, but for different reasons. The book details John Githongo's fight to reveal the level of corruption in Kenya. The fear of reprisals is keeping sellers from stocking it, while top officials named in the book are threatening to sue for libel. The book, ""It's Our Turn to Eat: The Story of a Kenyan Whistleblower,"" by Michela Wrong, focuses on John Githongo, whom the Kenyan government hired in 2003 to head an anti-graft unit. Githongo's investigations detailed an intricate web of corruption, allegedly featuring top Kenyan politicians. The most noted scandal -- Anglo Leasing -- revealed fraudulent deals, in which a fictitious company was paid millions of dollars for contracts using government funds, Kenyan media reported. Githongo, a former journalist, resigned in 2005 and fled to England. Wrong, an old friend, initially offered him shelter there.  Watch as book stirs controversy in Kenya » . The Kenyan government started a manhunt for him in the UK, Wrong said. A year later, Githongo released an explosive report detailing government fraud, which led to the resignation of some Kenyan politicians linked to the scandal. Attempts to reach Githongo through a spokesman were unsuccessful. The fact that there is corruption in the east African nation is not surprising. Bribery is so intertwined with the Kenyan culture, there is a code word for it. When someone offers a sly smile after a service and asks for ""chai,"" Swahili for tea, that's a cue to slap a bill on his outstretched palm. The book's story line goes beyond corruption, however. It gives intimate details about Githongo's fight and an insider's insight on how brazen corruption is in the upper echelon. It also humanizes Githongo, who -- despite being considered a traitor by some and a fearless anti-corruption advocate by others -- had remained a mysterious figure. The book's unavailability has not kept Kenyans from reading it. ""There's a stolen PDF [computer] file, which contains the manuscript, doing the rounds amongst the Kenyan reading groups and on mailing lists,"" Wrong said. ""The other way that people are getting it is, they're basically buying it in Johannesburg or in Tanzania or in London ... and taking it in their luggage and then selling copies to friends."" In addition Wrong pushed her publisher, Harper Collins, to release an e-book version of the book, and Kenyans are now able to download the book legally from the Internet. Wrong, a veteran Africa correspondent who has written books on Eritrea and the Democratic Republic of Congo, said some officials have threatened to sue her. ""They [officials] may lose more than they gain from that process,"" she said, adding that court testimony would offer the media a field day. A Kenya government spokesman called fears about selling the book unfounded. ""I am not aware that people are afraid of selling the book, because we have freedom of expression here and any book can be sold,"" Alfred Mutua said. ""A government in a free-market society does not control what people buy or sell. So if people do not want to sell books because of any litigation, that has nothing to do with us."" Booksellers have a reason to worry, because the nation's libel laws are designed to ensnare anyone involved with a product in question, according to Charles Otieno, a political analyst. ""Anything that is subject to libel, if you are found selling it, if you are found reading it or something like that, you are also actually the subject of the case,"" he said. ""So most people are not willing to take that risk."" The reluctance of sellers to stock the book is heightened by a deep-rooted fear of the government, Otieno said, . ""Nobody is willing to question government to that extent. Not many people in civil society are really as proactive as they were,"" he added. For bookstore owners, the issue comes down to the possibility of lawsuits. ""There are lots of names mentioned,"" said Chand Bahal, a bookseller. ""You can't say, 'I am going to sell this book and make it big.' ... You will be the scapegoat; you will be in trouble.""","Book on Kenyan corruption whistleblower not available in country's stores .

"(CNN) -- The blistering heat wave that has brought stifling conditions to much of the United States broke 55 record highs on Wednesday, the National Weather Service said Thursday. That's more than 1% of all temperature records in the country. Another 60 records were tied Wednesday, the weather service said. As many as 22 deaths are blamed on the heat, the service said. Excessive heat and humidity are ""expected to expand into the Ohio Valley and East Coast states for the remainder of the week,"" the weather service said in its forecast Thursday. The highest heat index values -- how hot it feels -- ""are expected across parts of the Midwest, Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic, where they are forecast to be between 105 and 115 degrees through Friday, with locally higher values possible,"" the forecast said.

But for some places, relief was already in store Thursday. ""The extremely hot temperatures should begin to subside across portions of the northern plains today,"" the National Weather Service said, ""but the intense heat will remain in place through the weekend across the central and southern plains."" Among the records broken Wednesday were temperatures in Walsh, Colorado, at 104; Garden City, Kansas, at 108; and Gage, Oklahoma, at 107, according to preliminary reports.

Scott Hoffot and his wife, Colleen, of Saskatchewan, Canada, arrived in Minneapolis Sunday with their camping gear, planning for a vacation spent mostly outdoors at a campground. Instead they're now doing ""more touristy"" things. ""We went from camping in a tent to staying in hotels, so that we could get air conditioning,"" said Hoffot. ""We spent a fair amount of time in the Mall of America yesterday because of the heat."" What's behind deadly heatwave?

Kulkarni started a new job selling natural ice cream for Pick-a-Pelata, a street-vending ice cream company, around Lake Calhoun in Minneapolis. She rides a bike, with the ice cream in a cooler, around one of the biggest and busiest lakes inside the city. One of Kulkarni's first days at work it was nearly 95 degrees.

In Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Cory Booker announced that facilities were available in every ward to help keep citizens cool. ""It is imperative that our residents drink plenty of fluids, stay indoors in a cool climate, and avoid strenuous activity,"" Booker said in a statement. ""I urge our senior citizens and Newark residents who lack air conditioning to come to one of our cooling centers."" Why you can't sleep when it's hot . In New York, Con Edison called on customers to stay cool and not waste energy. ""Store owners who leave doors open with the A/C running could be subject to fines from the city,"" ConEd said.

The heat wave has been very good for business,"" said Amanda Kinsella, director the company's sales and marketing division. ""Our lines have been flooded with calls for service."" The heat index in the Cincinnati area was expected to reach as high as 115 Thursday. The first confirmed heat-related death in Kansas City was declared Thursday, but it stemmed from a death last month. A 57-year-old man was found dead in his home on June 5, according to Dan Ferguson, who works for Jackson County. In addition to the man's death, there are 13 other possible heat-related deaths in Missouri -- the youngest was a woman in her mid-30s, and the oldest were two women in their mid-70s, said Jeff Hershberger, spokesman for the Kansas City Health Department. Heat hurts your insides too . It may take six weeks to several months for officials to process toxicology tests to determine whether all 13 died of heat-related causes, Hershberger said. In Wisconsin, a 65-year-old man from Fountain Prairie was confirmed by health officials to have died from heat-related causes Thursday, according to CNN affiliate WKOW. Columbia County Medical Examiner Angela Hinze said the man had underlying medical conditions that were made worse when he was helping a family member outside with housework. In Oklahoma, four heat-related deaths have been confirmed since May, said Cherokee Ballard, a spokeswoman for the state medical examiner.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Al Qaeda is the strongest it has been since the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a new U.S. government analysis concludes, according to a senior government official who has seen it. A Pakistani soldier mans a bunker near the Afghan border in a tribal area of Pakistan. Despite a campaign of military action and counterterrorism operations, al Qaeda has regained its strength and found safe haven in the tribal areas of Pakistan, the report says, according to counterterrorism officials familiar with the report. The five-page intelligence analysis remains classified and was prepared for senior U.S. policymakers. It was not issued in response to a specific threat. Two intelligence officials said the report's finding are similar to what is expected to be in the National Intelligence Estimate anticipated to be released later this summer. The NIE is the intelligence community's collective analysis of pressing national security issues. The White House's view is that ""over the past six years, we have prevented attacks from al Qaeda by taking the fight to them,"" a senior administration official said. ""But they are an enemy that adapts."" This new report backs up warnings by Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and other officials that al Qaeda remains a serious threat and that the United States is vulnerable despite the numerous security changes made since September 11, 2001.  Watch Chertoff explain his ""gut feeling"" » . Chertoff said Wednesday, however, that there is no ""specific, credible information"" that terrorist attacks on the United States are imminent. In a House Armed Services Committee hearing Wednesday, several senior intelligence officials talked about how the terrorist group has found refuge in parts of Pakistan. ""We actually see the al Qaeda central being resurgent in their role in planning operations,"" John Kringen, head of the CIA's intelligence directorate, testified at the hearing Wednesday. ""They seem to be fairly well settled into the safe haven in the ungoverned spaces of Pakistan there. We see more training. We see more money. We see more communications."" Thomas Fingar, deputy director of national intelligence, told lawmakers that al Qaeda leaders hiding in Pakistan are able to maintain relationships ""with affiliates throughout the Middle East, North and East Africa and Europe."" In a statement, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said it was no surprise al Qaeda has been able to reorganize and rebuild ""given President Bush's stubborn dedication to keeping our overextended military mired in an Iraqi civil war."" ""It is a travesty that Osama bin Laden remains at large nearly six years after the 9/11 attacks and appears to have found new sanctuary to operate freely in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border regions,"" Reid said. ""The Bush administration and most congressional Republicans would rather stubbornly stick with a flawed strategy and fight a war that senior military leaders say cannot be won militarily, than adapt to fighting the enemy who attacked us six years ago."" In recent weeks, counterterrorism authorities have expressed concern about the possibility of another attack on U.S. soil, saying several factors, such as the thwarted terror plots in Britain, have them on edge. The FBI has created a small group of agents and analysts to examine new threats and leads over the summer, a bureau official told CNN. The group, which was created several weeks ago, is supplementing what agents and others are also doing in field offices across the country and is an example of how the government is trying to make sure no credible lead is missed, the official said.

"(CNN) -- Confessed serial killer Israel Keyes was a murder addict who found great enjoyment in taking people's lives, police say. ""Israel Keyes didn't kidnap and kill people because he was crazy, he didn't kidnap and kill people because his deity told him to or because he had a bad childhood. Israel Keyes did this because he got an immense amount of enjoyment out of it, much like an addict gets an immense amount of enjoyment out of drugs,"" said Anchorage, Alaska, police Detective Monique Doll at a news briefing. ""He was addicted to the feeling he got when he was doing this, addicted to the feel of the hunt and of killing,"" Doll said. Keyes killed the last of his known victims, Anchorage coffee stand barista Samantha Koenig, 18, in February. He has confessed to killing at least seven other people: two in Vermont, four in Washington state, and one somewhere on the East Coast. He committed suicide in his Alaska jail cell earlier this month by slitting his wrist and strangling himself with bedding. Anchorage police and the FBI gave more details about their interviews with Keyes on Monday in hopes of generating new tips about his crimes. Police said that while he admitted eight murders, there may be at least three more, and that they need the public's help in their investigations. ""We want people to know what kind of person this fellow was so they can help us connect dots and maybe generate connections between missing person cases and Israel Keyes,"" Anchorage police Chief Mark Mew said. Authorities played a chilling tape Monday in which Keyes talked about how he lay in wait at an Alaska park with a sniper's rifle in hopes of killing a young couple who had parked there. He had his kill zone prepared, with drain cleaner and a shovel at the ready to dissolve and bury the body parts. ""I was gonna do my thing in the parking lot,"" Keyes said, but an Anchorage patrol officer showed up and checked on the couple. Keyes said he was prepared to kill the officer, too, but aborted his plan when another officer showed up. ""It could've got ugly, but fortunately for the cop guy,"" he said with a chuckle, ""his backup showed up."" ""I almost got myself into a lot of trouble on that one,"" Keyes said. ""As soon as his backup showed up I decided I better call it a night."" The incident is indicative of the way Keyes saw himself. Doll described him as ""very matter of fact"" but comfortable with who he was. ""Israel Keyes never expressed in any way, shape or form that he was ashamed of or regretted his actions,"" Doll said. ""He knew what he was and he was fine with it."" The Anchorage detective also said Keyes took pride ""in living this Dr. Jekyll-Mr. Hyde lifestyle,"" with neither family nor friends suspecting him. Doll said Keyes researched and read about, but did not emulate, other serial killers, including Ted Bundy, who killed as many as 40 people between 1974 and 1978. ""He was very careful to say he had not patterned himself after any other serial killer,"" she said. ""His ideas were his own. ... That mattered a lot to him."" Those ideas included careful planning and the ability to back off killing plans if variables changed the situation, such as a planned victim with a large dog, or a victim who didn't have a vehicle in which Keyes could evade authorities. Police said he broke his own rules in the abduction and killing of Koenig. He used her debit card to make an ATM withdrawal that eventually led police to him in Texas. Mew said Keyes started ""to be a bit compulsive toward the end."" Anchorage police Officer Jeff Bell said Keyes' end did not come as the killer thought it would. He envisioned being killed in a gun battle with police during a bank robbery, Bell said. Besides Koenig, whose body was found in a lake north of Anchorage, authorities have identified only two of Keyes' other victims, Bill and Lorraine Currier of Essex Junction, Vermont. More clues may come from an illegible, blood-soaked note that was found in Keyes' cell after his suicide. That is being analyzed at the FBI's lab in Quantico, Virginia, Mews said, in hopes of determining what Keyes wrote. Authorities are asking that anyone who may have information about Keyes get in contact with the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI or call their local FBI office.

"(CNN) -- A dinner out turned into an experience of a lifetime for a North Carolina family thanks to one stranger's heartfelt gesture. Ashley England and her family want to thank a customer who paid for their meal Friday night and left behind a touching note about their special needs son. A photo of the note has gone viral, shared with thousands of people on Facebook. England told CNN her family, including husband, Jason, 8-year-old son Riley, 4-year-old brother Logan, the boys' grandmother and their great-grandmother were together at the Stag & Doe restaurant in China Grove, North Carolina, for a family meal when their special needs son, Riley, started to get frustrated. He was hungry and couldn't get the Netflix on his mom's phone to work. The waitress, the autistic girl and the broken hamburger . Since Riley suffers from epilepsy and is non-verbal, England said, it's hard for him to communicate and he screams and acts out when he's frustrated. England said he started to make screaming noises, beat on their table and threw her phone, catching the attention of some nearby customers. Although a few customers were looking, it wasn't the worst experience her family has had out in public since Riley's condition was diagnosed when he was a toddler, England said. But she was frustrated, she said, and in the past few weeks it has been really tough controlling Riley's behavior. So what happened next was just what the family needed. Autism, dining out and a side of kindness . As their waitress was delivering food to the family's table, England noticed another waitress, Tonya Griffin, walk up with a few tears in her eyes. She passed along a message from another customer that the England family says they will never forget. Griffin told the family, ""your meal's been paid for and he wanted me to give you this note."" The note written on a customer's order slip read, ""God only gives special children to special people."" England told CNN the gesture was really needed and it made her cry. ""I just broke down, the past month has just been so hard."" She added, ""He just doesn't know what we've been going through and how much it was needed at the moment."" When England updated her Facebook page about the family's experience Friday night, she ended it with this message: ""Dear stranger, thank you for giving me a blessing tonight in a way you will never know."" England says she will be back at the restaurant when it reopens Wednesday -- its hours are 4 to 10 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday -- in hopes she can find the man to thank him personally.

"(CNN) -- A day after four of Sen. John McCain's top political strategists stepped down, the co-chairman of his Florida campaign was arrested Wednesday for allegedly offering an undercover police officer money for a sex act, Titusville police said. Florida state Rep. Bob Allen faces charges of solicitation for prostitution after he was arrested in a Titusville city park that had been under surveillance, police said. He allegedly offered an undercover police officer $20 for the unspecified act. His attorney, Philip Lupo of Titusville, said the charge was a second-degree misdemeanor. Allen told CNN affiliate WFTV the incident was ""a very big misunderstanding."" ""This is a very gross mistake, a very big mistake,"" he said, adding that this is what the judicial system is for. Allen said he helped build the park, and was there looking around. At a late-afternoon press conference Thursday, Allen made a statement but took no questions. ""I am filing a not guilty plea. I am vigorously going to fight this,"" he said. ""I am not resigning my office, because the people elected me [and] want me to do a good job and I am going to do a good job for them in finishing this term. ... ""This is an ugly and unpleasant situation that has been thrust upon me and my family that is not true, it is inaccurate and it is therefore not guilty."" There was no initial comment from the McCain campaign. In March, the McCain campaign issued a news release on its Florida leadership team, saying, ""Allen will serve as a House co-chair for Sen. McCain's campaign."" Allen was elected to the Florida House in 2000. His arrest comes a day after McCain's campaign manager, Terry Nelson, and chief strategist, John Weaver, announced their departures in joint statements released by the campaign. McCain's deputy campaign manager and political director also resigned this week. Earlier this week, U.S. Sen. David Vitter, the Southern regional chairman for Rudy Giuliani's presidential campaign, was linked to the so-called D.C. Madam's escort service. Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, said, ""This was a very serious sin in my past for which I am, of course, completely responsible. Several years ago, I asked for and received forgiveness from God and from my wife in confession and marriage counseling."" It was the second blow for Giuliani's campaign. Last month, South Carolina Treasurer Thomas Ravenel, the state chairman for Giuliani's campaign, was indicted on federal cocaine charges. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Despite most of the team being of short stature and playing barefoot, the Triqui Indian boys from Mexico won the championship -- and the hearts of many -- at the International Festival of Mini-Basketball held in Argentina. Their coach, Sergio Zuniga explains that playing barefoot is a reflection of the poverty in their community in the state of Oaxaca. ""The boys train barefoot, they always walk barefoot. There are no resources to buy shoes,"" Zuniga commented in an interview with the Basketball Federation of the Province of Cordoba, where the tournament was held. The seven games against six local teams ended with incredible scores: 86-3 over Celestes; 22-6 against Cordoba University; 72-16 against Central; 82-18 over Hindu; 44-12 against Monteeis and 40-16 over Regatas de Mendoza. The National Sports and Physical Culture Commission of Mexico named the team as the ""Barefoot Giants of the Mountains."" Blog: New era for women's basketball in the U.S.? 54 teams from various Argentine provinces and countries such as Mexico, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Uruguay and Venezuela, participated in the tournament. A total of 8,000 kids were part of the championship held from October 11th to 14th. Last year, the youth championship (which started in 2010 in Ecuador) was held in La Vega, Dominican Republic. About 400 kids participated in the event. Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador and delegations from 20 Dominican provinces were part of the championship. Education first . The Triqui children-training program began its operations in 2009 with 500 kids. Nowadays, it trains around 2,500 children with focuses on: psychology, leadership and ""laughter therapy,"" according to coach Zuniga. ""The main idea was to help these children through sports, to give them a different opportunity: go to school, play basketball, to get away from the mountains, to see other parts of the world,"" he said. The most important factor that determines who participates in the tournament (or who gets to be in the team) is to have good grades. ""If they don't have a 8.5 grade --out of 10-- (in elementary school,) they don't train or play."" ""With education as the motivator, the kids are going back to school, which is the project's main goal: give these kids an education through basketball. Away from the sports, the most important results are those reached at school."" According to Zuniga, the academy's success inspired other Mexican states to adopt the Triqui community model. Similarly other countries such as Peru, Bolivia and some Hispanic communities in the United States have expressed interest in the program. Winning attitude . The Triqui kids were inspired after the Mexican team reigned at the 2013 FIBA Americas Championship held in Caracas, Venezuela in September. ""We can also do it. If they did it, we can also win, we can qualify and be world champions,"" said Rigoberto Lopez, 11, a member of the Triqui kids team, to CNN en Espanol before traveling to Argentina. Silverio Cruz, 9, another member of the Triqui basketball team, said the most important element in the game is to have the ""mentality of a champion."" Before leaving Argentina, the kids also defeated the Gorriones de Argentina 3-1 in a soccer match. The team's next goal is to participate in the 2014 Barcelona Cup Basketball Tournament. In the meantime, they will keep working hard and will continue their journey to achieve their goals. ""It's beautiful to see that all their cons became their weapons. Hunger, poverty, motivated them to show themselves as they are. It's something we lack in Mexico: character, strength, inner strength. They are setting an example, even to me, that yes, you can do it,"" said Zuniga.","Triqui Indian boys from Mexico win basketball tournament playing barefoot .

"(CNN) -- Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte resigned Monday after a far-right party withdrew its support for his government, a government spokesman said. The move may clear the way for early elections in the Netherlands, possibly as soon as this summer, the government said. The resignation came after the far-right party withdrew from talks about an austerity package worth â‚¬14.2 billion, the equivalent of $18.6 billion, according to a news report reprinted on a parliamentary website. Lawmakers are scheduled to meet Tuesday to decide how to go forward. Queen Beatrix asked Rutte and his ministers to stay in their positions until new elections. Rutte's government had depended on the support of Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom, which came in third in parliamentary elections two years ago. No party won enough seats to govern alone in 2010, so Rutte cobbled together a coalition with another center-right party. But even that alliance did not command a majority in parliament, so they relied on the support of Wilders' anti-Muslim party. The Party for Freedom did not get control of any government ministries, but the coalition agreement included elements it pushed for, such as a burqa ban. No ban has been put in place. Wilders' Party for Freedom defied predictions by taking 24 seats in parliament in June 2010, more than doubling the number of seats it held before the vote. Wilders himself has been in and out of court for years, accused of inciting hatred against Muslims with his controversial film ""Fitna."" The movie, which he released online in March 2008 to international outcry, features disturbing images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from the Quran in an apparent attempt to paint Islam as a threat to Western society.","Lammakers will meet Tuesday to decide how to go forward .

"Washington (CNN) -- With the stroke of her pen a few years ago, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer took the lead in a GOP immigration retreat that made it harder for Republicans to win the White House in 2012. Now, she is again at the center of a big national debate, but this time might her signature be part of an evolution helpful to GOP chances in 2016? At issue then: her support for Arizona's tough immigration law. Brewer signed SB 1070 into law in 2010 and its tough provisions became a national flashpoint and contributed to President Barack Obama's huge advantage among Latino voters. And now? A Brewer veto is at issue: The governor rejected legislation that would have allowed Arizona businesses to deny services to gay people on grounds of religious beliefs. Veto follows business backlash over anti-gay bill . Tolerance is an issue for Republicans among key voting blocs, especially independents and younger voters. So some GOP strategists were quick to applaud Brewer for a move they say shows Republicans are listening and adapting to changing times -- and changing views on gay rights. ""It tells us the Republican Party is learning the difference between standing for principle and standing in the middle of a busy intersection,"" said GOP strategist Alex Castellanos. ""In other words, we are learning that futile gestures that have only symbolic impact do the GOP cause more harm than good."" Who's behind the religious freedom push? Many social conservatives critical to GOP success vehemently disagree with that take, however, and the shifting tides of the immigration debate in recent years suggest we have hardly heard the last word. Effects of immigration revolt still felt . Remember, some of the toughest proposals for new immigration steps were a response to a Republican president -- George W. Bush -- and a Republican presidential nominee -- Sen. John McCain. They favored a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented workers, setting off a revolt among conservatives who consider that granting amnesty to lawbreakers. And that revolt had ripple effects that continue to this day. Arizona's 2010 legislation was a conservative-led rebuke to the views of Bush, McCain and by then, Obama. Brewer was hardly known as a conservative firebrand, but she signed the law and avoided a backlash from the right as she readied for a re-election campaign. In 2012, it was Mitt Romney, once a supporter of the Bush-McCain-Kennedy approach, embracing the Arizona law and saying with tough measures those here illegally would ""self deport."" Now, House Speaker John Boehner, also in general agreement with the Bush-McCain-Kennedy approach, won't bring such a measure to a vote because he knows a vocal minority in his caucus would revolt. Veto a bump in the road for ""religious freedom"" movement . Brewer's veto on the latest Arizona bill drew praise from the Obama White House and from Hillary Clinton, which tells you all you need to know about whether social conservatives will press the issue in the next White House campaign. ""Looking ahead to 2016, there are only going to be more clashes and court cases which will make 'judges' an even bigger issue in the GOP primaries and caucuses,"" said conservative strategist Keith Appell. Strategist: Debate is about limiting government reach . Castellanos agrees but sees a changing tone. ""We will still have the debate in the primaries, but it will be less intense,"" he predicts. ""The party isn't changing its values but is learning that we can't be big government conservatives, even when it is convenient for us, on social conservative issues. ""In short, the debate is increasingly about limiting the role of government, where social conservatives and libertarians agree, than about gay marriage, where Republicans don't."" This finding in a recent New York Times/CBS News poll reinforces that latter point: ""Over all, Republican support for same-sex marriage is on the rise. In the fall of 2012, just 24% of Republicans backed legalizing the unions; now 40% of Republicans do so."" Romney and Florida Gov. Rick Scott were among major GOP voices who urged Brewer to veto the Arizona gay rights law. But if we have learned anything in recent years, when leading GOP establishment figures say one thing, vocal voices in the tea party and social conservative movement will urge another -- and try to punish those who disagree. So what happens the 2014 election year -- in the courts and at the ballot box -- will have as much if not more influence on the 2016 intra-Republican debate as Brewer's veto. ""These instances where gay rights clash with free exercise of faith,"" the conservative strategist Appell said, ""will only gin up and activate the conservative base even more in 2014."" Castellanos believes the growing libertarian streak within the GOP will push the party to an eventual resolution of these tensions. "" 'Freedom nationally, values personally,' is where the GOP is going,"" Castellanos argues. But, mindful of the continuing immigration divide, what Castellanos doesn't argue is that any GOP evolution on gay rights and same-sex marriage specifically will happen smoothly.","Arizona governor's hard line on immigration hurt GOP's chances of winning White House .
Gov. Jan Brewer's veto of anti-gay bill was applauded for adapting to changing times .
But praise from the left won't help conservatives accept unpopular decision ."
"(CNN) -- Mississippi lawmakers passed a bill Wednesday that would require any physician performing abortions in the state to be a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist and to have admitting privileges at an area hospital. The bill ""should effectively close the only abortion clinic in Mississippi,"" said Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves in a statement. ""This is a strong bill that will effectively end abortion in Mississippi."" If the state's only abortion facility, Jackson Women's Health Organization, closes, Mississippi women seeking abortions would have to leave the state. The clinic's owner, Diane Derzis, said in a telephone interview that all her doctors are obstetrician-gynecologists, but only one has admitting privileges at an area hospital. She vowed to fight to remain open. ""We are going to do everything we can to remain there ... we are not going to let the women of Mississippi down,"" said Derzis. Wednesday's vote by the state Senate is the latest in a string of attempts by lawmakers to close her facility, she said. Last year, the state introduced a bill known as the Personhood Amendment, which would have defined life as beginning at the moment of conception. The bill was defeated by voters in November. The bill is in a period for comment before it will be sent to Republican Gov. Phil Bryant, who has said he wants Mississippi to become ""abortion-free."" ""This legislation is an important step in strengthening abortion regulations and protecting the health and safety of women,"" he said after Wednesday's vote, in a statement. ""I am sick about this,"" said Felicia Brown-Williams, regional director of public policy for Planned Parenthood in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. The bill ""puts in place requirements that intentionally try to make it impossible for physicians to provide abortion services. ... Voters have already said that they want the government to stay out of decisions that should be made by a woman, her family and her physician."" She expressed hope the bill might not be sent to the governor. ""We are asking Mississippians to reach out to their senators and ask them to reconsider their vote on this,"" she said. Still, she acknowledged, the bill is likely to be tabled Thursday and then sent to Bryant. There is no medical reason to require physicians performing abortions be board-certified OB/GYNs or that they have admitting privileges, Brown-Williams said. If the clinic stops offering abortion services because it is unable to find providers with those qualifications, the bill ""would be a backdoor ban on abortion."" The Center for Reproductive Rights' state advocacy counsel, Jordan Goldberg, said that, if the goal of the legislation is to impose restrictions on abortion providers that are not imposed on other medical providers offering similar care, then ""that would raise serious constitutional problems and a legal challenge would certainly be possible."" ""It's not about medicine,"" she said. ""It's just about politics."" Seven other states require abortion providers to have hospital privileges, but no other state requires that an abortion provider be an OB/GYN, said Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute in Washington. ""This bill is an attempt to make it so difficult to become an abortion provider that no one will do it."" Though the 1973 Supreme Court landmark decision in Roe v. Wade made abortion legal in all 50 states, Mississippi's bill could make the state the first where no abortions could be performed, she said. ""It's an attempt to eliminate access without taking on Roe directly."" In 2008, the last year for which data are available, 2,770 abortions were performed in the state, according to Guttmacher.","Mississippi lawmakers: Abortion providers must be OB/GYNs, have admitting privileges .

"(CNN) -- You know the old saying -- if a deal is too good to be true, then it probably is too good to be true. That's what happened to a major retailer's online shoppers Friday afternoon. Sears.com inadvertently advertised Apple's 16GB iPad 2 for $69, much less than the regular advertised price of $744.99. That low price got the attention of web shoppers and the deal went viral on Twitter and other social media websites. Many people took advantage of the unbelievable deal, though a Sears spokesperson couldn't give an exact number. Friday night, Sears posted a statement online telling customers the error was made by a third-party vendor and the deal will not be honored. ""We want you to know that, unfortunately, today one of the Marketplace third party sellers told us that they mistakenly posted incorrect pricing information on two Apple iPad models on the Marketplace portion of the website. If you purchased either of these products recently, your order has been cancelled and your account will be credited,"" the statement said. Paula Knight of Riverview, Florida, was one of the disappointed customers. Her son has Asperger's syndrome and relied heavily on his iPad for his schoolwork, until it was stolen a few months ago. So when Knight's friends told her about the great deal on Sears.com, she said she jumped on it. Knight said immediately after she paid for the iPad, she received e-mail confirmations from both PayPal and Sears. About six hours later, Sears sent her an e-mail to tell her that her order was canceled because of the mistake. ""I shop online all the time and I've never had anything like this happen,"" Knight said. ""They want to blame a third party, but the order confirmation e-mail I got was from Sears."" ""They are a huge company I thought I could trust and rely on,"" Knight said. ""But if they don't honor this, I won't ever shop at Sears again. I just want my order honored.""","Sears website advertised 16GB iPad for $69 .

He said LAN Cargo apparently forgot to apply for permission to land or didn't know airspace restrictions were in place for the summit. A statement from the hauler, based in Chile, confirmed Flight UC 1503 wasn't able to land in Amsterdam and was diverted to Frankfurt ""because of an error in the special classification of the flight."" The plane was later permitted to continue to Amsterdam, the airline said.","Cargo Boeing 777 entered Dutch airspace as world leaders gathered for summit .

"Loganville, Georgia (CNN) -- This is not a movie. There's no dramatic music in the background. A happy ending, far from a guarantee. The concern in Donnie Herman's voice was clear as day. So was his stress. With two telephones to his ear, he listened to his wife, Melinda, as she fled into an attic of their Loganville home. With her: Her two 9-year-old children and a loaded .38 revolver. In the house: An intruder with a crowbar. On another line was the 911 operator Donnie Herman had called for help. Herman's words to his wife, as he sat helplessly, an hour away from the home, were recorded. ""Stay in the attic,"" he instructed her, calmly. ""He's in the bedroom,"" she told him. He repeated the words to the 911 operator. ""Shh. Relax,"" Herman said, trying to calm his wife. Then he instructed her to do what was fast becoming a realistic possibility. ""Melinda -- if he opens up the door, you shoot him! You understand?"" What happened next has made the Hermans the new faces of the right to bear arms. Melinda Herman fired a six-shot revolver at the intruder, hitting him five times, in his torso and in his face. Surprisingly, he managed to flee. Opinion: The case for gun rights is stronger than you think . Gun rights groups say this shows that law-abiding citizens should be allowed to buy their weapon of choice and as big a magazine or ammunition clip as they like. They remind people that Melinda Herman had only a six-shot revolver. ""It's a good thing she wasn't facing more attackers. Otherwise she would have been in trouble and she would have run out of ammunition,"" said Erich Pratt, director of communications for the Gun Owners of America. ""She shot him five times and he still didn't drop. This is going to endanger people's safety."" The right of self-protection has been thrust into the forefront in a national debate after last month's Newtown, Connecticut, tragedy. This week, a federal task force led by Vice President Joe Biden is holding talks with private industry groups, the NRA, and legislators -- all to determine the correct balance between the right to self-protection and preventing further mass shootings. Meanwhile, Americans are flocking to gun shops to buy guns and ammunition in record numbers -- partly due to Newtown and partly due to their fears that the rules are about to change on what they can legally own. The FBI said it conducted almost 2.8 million checks for gun purchases in December, a record high for a month. Donnie and Melinda Herman own two guns for protection at home, but until two weeks ago, she had never fired a gun. Her husband told sheriff's department investigator's that he took her shooting so that she'd be familiar with the family's guns if she ever had to use one. Now, clutching the .38 revolver, Melinda Herman was in the middle of a heart-pounding crisis inside her own home. She had already locked multiple doors before she and her children took refuge in an adjacent-room attic -- the kind with a small door that you have to bend down to go through. The intruder had used the crowbar to break through the front door and then two other doors upstairs, and she could hear him coming closer and closer. On the phone, Donnie Herman calmly instructed his wife about the use of the weapon she had practiced on. ""Remember everything I showed you. Everything I taught you,"" he told her, and he reassured her that help was on the way. Then it happened. ""She shot him. She's shooting him. She's shooting him. She's shooting him. She's shooting him. ... Shoot him again! Shoot him!"" Donnie Herman said as the 911 dispatcher listened. He then lost phone contact with his wife and children. His anguish and the pain of not knowing what had happened may be etched in his mind for eternity. But they were safe. He learned later that his wife fired all six shots, and hit the intruder with all but one bullet. Parents defend right to keep guns in the home . Not realizing she was out of ammunition, she ordered the man to stay on the floor as he bled. She then fled the house with her children. Walton County Sheriff Joe Chapman -- whose office responded to the shooting at the Hermans' home -- said he believes the mother and her two children were in a life-and-death situation and she had no choice but to exercise her constitutional right to self-defense. ""Had it not turned out the way that it did, I would possibly be working a triple homicide, not having a clue as to who it is we're looking for,"" he told CNN. Despite being shot five times, the suspect, identified as Paul Ali Slater, still managed to get back into his SUV, but he drove off the road and crashed a short distance away. He remains hospitalized. Due to privacy laws, the hospital cannot divulge any information on his condition. But the controversy continues. Home gun ownership and self-defense will always be controversial. The Hermans' story of self-defense is being used by the National Rifle Association and the Gun Owners of America to make their point to the White House and Congress about gun ownership. But Donnie Herman has told people he's not interested in being a poster boy for anyone. He has not yet responded to CNN's request for an interview with him and his wife. ""My wife is a hero. She protected her kids. She did what she was supposed to do as a responsible parent and gun owner,"" Herman told CNN affiliate WSB. Yet it's unclear whether the benefits of having a loaded and readily available gun in one's home outweigh the drawbacks. ""It's more common for an armed homeowner in the United States to be a victim of suicide, homicide, assault or an accidental shooting than it is for that person to shoot an intruder,"" according to Dr. Arthur Kellermann, a senior health policy analyst at Rand Corporation, a non-partisan think tank. Kellermann led research for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the 1990s which found that people who have guns in their homes are nearly three times more likely to be a victim of homicide and nearly five times more likely to commit suicide. Experts also say that simply having a gun for self-protection does not guarantee safety. They say the fear is that many people will take part in what might be considered a feeding frenzy by purchasing a gun, but not learn how to properly use it. Sheriff Chapman holds courses for homeowners who want to learn how to safely and properly use a weapon. ""Be proficient with it. Be taught how to use it. Train with it,"" he said. ""I often tell people, 'If you don't think that you have what it takes to take a human life then don't bother buying one. Don't waste your money. Don't waste your time,"" he told CNN. ""Don't put it in a drawer and think that's the answer to everything, because it isn't.""

"(CNN) -- It's a demon buried deep within the French psyche -- a demon which refuses to be exorcized. A word which brings shivers down the spine and strikes a fear into the heart of the country's football fans. In Rio de Janeiro, the ghosts of years past haunted France again -- the ""Angstgegner"" returned. Germany, the ""bogey team"" as it is known in France, wrote another painful chapter into Les Bleus' World Cup history on Friday. A 1-0 victory secured Germany's place in the semifinals for a record fourth consecutive tournament. But unlike in 1982 and 1986, when Germany defeated the French in the last four on both occasions, this was not a battle of epic proportions. There was not the drama, nor the controversy -- but the end result was the same. Mats Hummels' 12th-minute goal gave Germany a lead it never looked like relinquishing against a French side which flattered to deceive. In fact, it was almost an apologetic exit from Didier Deschamps' players -- so disappointing after the team's encouraging performances in the group stage. At a tournament where there have been so many surprises, perhaps it was reassuring that there remains one constant. Germany, whether it plays to its maximum or just within itself, seems to always get the result it craves. Joachim Low's side will now face host nation Brazil -- which beat Colombia -- in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday, while France returns home pondering what might have been. The tears flowed for those draped in blue -- this was supposed to be the day where France finally gained revenge. Some 32 years may have passed since the two countries met at the 1982 World Cup, but the painful memories remain. At the time, France's World Cup hopes were in the balance with the game at 1-1 when Patrick Battiston ran on to meet Michel Platini's pass. Battiston was the overwhelming favorite to reach the ball first -- and he did so, but as he approached, West Germany goalkeeper Toni Schumacher laid the Frenchman out cold with a brutal attack. Battiston, shorn of three teeth and suffering damaged vertebrae, left the field on a stretcher, his limp hand held by a shaken Platini -- who feared his teammate might have even died. Schumacher stood tall -- he wasn't red-carded, nor was he even cautioned. Instead, he saved two penalties in the shootout following a 3-3 draw as West Germany reached the final, before losing to Italy. It was an achievement which preserved his name in notoriety, even securing him top spot in a poll held by a French newspaper for the most hated German -- a poll he won ahead of Adolf Hitler. While the incident may not register on the German consciousness, it was repeated endlessly on televisions in the buildup to Friday's contest. A game with a grudge -- it's hardly a new experience for Germany, which appears to encounter such fixtures on a regular basis. Its experience at this level is undisputed -- but a failure to win the World Cup in 24 years has not gone unnoticed. In 2002, Rudi Voller's team was defeated in the final by Brazil -- since then there have been three consecutive semifinal defeats. For so long German football has been admired, but with success comes expectation and, in terms of triumphs, ""Die Mannschaft"" has failed to deliver. Perhaps this is the year where Low's side finally delivers. Criticized after a 2-1 extra-time victory over Algeria in the last 16 at Brazil 2014, Germany began brightly against France and made light of the flu virus which had swept through its camp. Just 12 minutes of the contest had elapsed when Hummels held off Raphael Varane to head home Toni Kroos' perfect delivery. Given the number of spectacular strikes witnessed at this World Cup, Hummels' effort was remarkable for its simplicity. France, temporarily dazed by conceding, began to assert itself with the impressive Mathieu Valbuena beginning to cause Germany problems. The diminutive midfielder, so influential in the group stage as France breezed through with ease, came close to forging an equalizer with 11 minutes of the first half remaining. Antoine Griezmann found space on the left and his pass allowed Valbuena to curl the ball towards goal only for Manuel Neuer to save and Karim Benzema to lash wildly at the rebound. Benzema, who scored three times in his opening two games, then went close before the interval as Hummels blocked the forward's close-range header. In 10 previous ties where it had trailed at halftime of a World Cup tie, France had lost on each and every occasion. But this French side has already overcome the odds. That it qualified for the tournament at all was somewhat of a surprise given its dreadful performance in the playoff tie. A 2-0 defeat by Ukraine in the first leg left Deschamps staring into the abyss -- a misery only averted by a miraculous 3-0 victory in the return leg four days later. But a comeback against Germany, a team renowned for its ruthlessness and ability to dominate its opponents is a far more difficult proposition. Deschamps' decision to replace a defensive midfielder in Yohan Cabaye with striker Loic Remy signaled his side's intentions. His pace, in addition to the threat posed by Griezmann and Benzema, appeared to trouble a Germany defense which was never managed to give impression of being wholly convincing. But whenever France did manage to get in behind its opponents, Neuer provided a formidable presence, denying Blaise Matuidi from close range. As both teams began to suffer in the heat, the action moved from end to end, with Germany twice failing to put the result beyond doubt . Then, with the contest entering its final throes, Benzema's effort -- from a position where he would be expected to score -- was palmed away by Neuer in almost nonchalant fashion. As the final whistle blew, heads fell, tears followed and French players were left with an all too familiar feeling -- the ""Angstgegner"" had struck again.","Germany books place in semifinal of World Cup .

"GENEVA, Switzerland (CNN)  -- The Obama administration has been talking about ""pressing the reset button"" with Russia after relations ""crashed"" when Russia invaded Georgia last August. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laugh about their ""reset' button. When Secretary of State Hillary Clinton greeted Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva on Friday before sitting down to their working dinner, she presented him a small green box with a ribbon. Inside was a red button with the Russian word ""peregruzka"" printed on it. ""I would like to present you with a little gift that represents what President Obama and Vice President Biden and I have been saying and that is: 'We want to reset our relationship and so we will do it together.'"" Clinton, laughing, added, ""We worked hard to get the right Russian word. Do you think we got it?"" she asked Lavrov. ""You got it wrong,"" Lavrov said."" Both diplomats laughed. ""It should be ""perezagruzka"" (the Russian word for reset,) Lavrov said. ""This says 'peregruzka,' which means 'overcharged.'"" The question came up at the news conference afterward. ""In a way, the word that's on the button turns out to be also true,"" Clinton said. ""We are resetting, and because we are resetting, the minister and I have an overload of work."" Asked by a Russian reporter whether he had pressed the button, Lavrov said that he and Clinton did, indeed. ""It is big and red and I hope that Russia and the United States, and other countries will never press on another button which used to be associated with a destructive war,"" he said. The ""overload,"" Clinton said, is a broad agenda of issues. ""We are going to systematically go through each and every one of them,"" she added. Clinton said the two sides will get to work on re-negotiating a follow-up to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and nonproliferation. On other issues like Afghanistan, the Middle East and Iran, Clinton said, ""We will work through them."" On issues where there is disagreement, Clinton said, ""We are keeping those on the list because, we think through closer cooperation and building trust in each other, we can even tackle some of those differences."" Lavrov agreed the burden of the agenda for the two countries is ""enormous,"" but added: ""I don't think either Hillary or I have any desire to be freed from any burden."" Clinton called the encounter ""a very productive meeting of the minds."" She said both Lavrov and she are ""very practical-minded"" and will create a ""specific set of objectives and responsibilities"" to present to presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev before the leaders' first face-to-face meeting in April at the G-20 meeting in London. On the START treaty, she said Russia and the United States intend to have an agreement by the end of this year when the treaty expires and are ""going to get to work immediately"" on it. Lavrov was asked about Russian intentions to install S-300 missiles in Iran. He said the decision ""will be made exclusively on the basis of law in accordance with Russian law, and will be under expert control, which is one of the strictest in the world and of course in accordance with international agreements."" Lavrov said the weapons Russia provides to its partners are ""nondestabilizing, defensive weapons."" In an apparent reference to U.S. military supplies to Georgia, Lavrov said, ""We want our partners to act the same way and show restraint in military supplies to those countries where, including very recently, those weapons have been used very close to our borders."" Senior U.S. officials who briefed reporters afterward, however, said they had not read Georgia into the minister's comments. They said the discussion ranged broadly over a number of areas and ""we now have a very substantive work agenda that they just outlined."" ""It would have been easier and in a first meeting almost natural to be much more general but in this case it was very focused and very productive in laying out steps,"" one official said. On the proposed missile defense system the United States is considering installing in Poland and the Czech Republic, one official said, ""Minister Lavrov made it clear he had listened quite attentively to Secretary Clinton's comments about missile defense ... and I think it's got them thinking.""","United States, Russia want to ""reset"" relations after years of tension .

"(CNN) -- Nearly 13 years after the 9/11 attacks, many Americans were likely surprised to learn that one of their fellow citizens had committed suicide on behalf of al Qaeda in a massive bombing attack last week in northern Syria. The American al Qaeda recruit's name was Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, according to the U.S. State Department, and he grew up in Vero Beach, Florida, where he played high school football. Abu-Salha, who was 22, is the first American suicide bomber in Syria, but he is not the first U.S. citizen to die in a suicide attack on behalf of an al Qaeda-affiliated group. In the past six years, at least three Americans have conducted suicide attacks in Somalia for Al-Shabaab, al Qaeda's Somali affiliate. It is cases like that of Abu-Salha that explain why senior U.S. counterterrorism officials tell me that they are ""all Syria, all the time."" Insurgencies such as the one going on in Syria against the Bashar al-Assad regime can go on for many years. Indeed, since World War II, the average insurgency has lasted at least a decade, according to an authoritative study by RAND. The Syrian conflict is now only in its fourth year, so Syria could well prove an important training ground for foreign fighters for many years in the future. Also, al Qaeda-affiliated groups now control territory stretching from Aleppo in western Syria to Falluja in Iraq, 400 miles to the east. This is a large safe haven for al Qaeda in the heart of the Middle East. The fact that the Syrian conflict will likely go on for a long time, and that it is already providing a large safe haven to al Qaeda and like-minded groups, deeply worries U.S. administration officials. And Syria, after all, is an issue that has entirely happened on the Obama administration's watch, unlike Iraq or Afghanistan. According to a senior U.S. intelligence official, Abu-Salha is one of around 100 Americans who have traveled to Syria or have tried to do so as the civil war there grinds on. Not all of these Americans have joined al Qaeda -- there are many factions fighting in Syria -- but a number have done so. Four other Americans have been publicly identified as having tried to join al Qaeda in Syria or have fought alongside the group, according to a count by the New America Foundation, . Sinh Vinh Ngo Nguyen of Southern California pleaded guilty last year to a charge of attempting to provide weapons training to al Qaeda. Nguyen had traveled to Syria in 2012 where he fought alongside the Syrian al Qaeda affiliate, which is known as the al-Nusra Front. Basit Sheikh, a legal permanent U.S. resident from Pakistan, was arrested by the FBI at Raleigh-Durham airport in North Carolina last year while trying to fly to Lebanon, allegedly in order to join the al-Nusra Front. Sheikh's father has said the allegations against his son are false. Similarly, Abdella Tounisi, an 18-year-old American citizen from Aurora, Illinois, was arrested at Chicago's O'Hare airport on April 19, 2013, and was charged with attempting to join the al-Nusra Front. Tounisi's father also denied the charges. And two months ago, Nicholas Teausant, a 20-year-old from California, was arrested near the Canadian border while allegedly traveling to join an al Qaeda splinter group in Syria. He has pleaded not guilty to the charge. It is not just the Americans who have fought in Syria or have attempted to do so who worry Obama administration officials. There are now ""foreign fighters"" from around the world who are pouring into Syria. At a conference in Washington on Friday to discuss how al Qaeda and its affiliates have transformed in recent years, Jen Easterly, the senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council, noted that the administration is worried about ""the unprecedented number of fighters flowing into Syria."" A particular concern is the many hundreds of Europeans who have fought in Syria, who may use training acquired there to carry out attacks in the West. Many are from ""visa waiver"" countries that do not need visas to travel to the United States. Underlining the seriousness of this threat: On Sunday, French authorities arrested a suspect in the May 24 shooting at the Jewish Museum in Brussels, where three people were killed with an AK-47. The chief prosecutor of Paris, Francois Molins, said that the suspect, Mehdi Nemmouche, traveled to Syria last year, one of 700 French citizens reported to have gone there. According to British officials, 450 British citizens or residents have traveled to Syria to fight over the past three years, and about 80% of those have returned to the UK. And the war in Syria is attracting -- just as it is in the United States -- fighters from all kinds of ethnic backgrounds, not just those of Syrian descent. A British official says the vast majority of British fighters going to Syria do not have any real links to the country other than a desire to fight in a holy war against the al-Assad regime. The problem in Syria is compounded by the fact that, according to both British counterterrorism officials and U.S. intelligence officials, senior al Qaeda members based in Pakistan have traveled to Syria to direct operations. According to a senior U.S. intelligence official, these include veteran members of al Qaeda ""with strong resumes and full Rolodexes."" As FBI Director James Comey explained in an interview with The Washington Post a month ago, officials are determined to prevent the kind of ""blowback"" from Syria that occurred previously from foreign fighters who had trained in Afghanistan in the years before 9/11. ""We see Syria as that, but an order of magnitude worse in a couple of respects. Far more people going there. Far easier to travel to and back from. So there's going to be a diaspora out of Syria at some point, and we are determined not to let lines be drawn from Syria today to a future 9/11."" Interestingly, an American cleric, Ahmad Musa Jibril, who was born in Dearborn, Michigan, in 1972, is an important spiritual influence on the foreign fighters who have joined al Qaeda-affiliated groups in Syria, although there is no suggestion that Jibril is involved himself in recruitment efforts for these militant groups. This finding was reported in a paper released in April by the London-based International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Violence, which has done authoritative work tracking the foreign fighters traveling to Syria and which arrived at its conclusions by tracking the social media accounts of foreign fighters in Syria. Many of the foreign fighters in Syria are avid posters on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Indeed, the suicide attack by the Floridian Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha last week was documented by al Qaeda's propaganda arm in Syria and posted on YouTube. If Vietnam was the first war covered by television, and the Gulf War was the first war carried live by cable news, in many ways Syria is the first social media war -- where the conflict is largely documented on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. All of these innovative tools were, of course, invented in the United States. The irony that al Qaeda members in Syria use these tools routinely is no doubt lost on most of them. Al Qaeda doesn't really do irony. Thanks to David Sterman for his research assistance.","U.S. citizen Moner Abu-Salha commits suicide on behalf of al Qaeda in a Syria bombing attack .

"(CNN) -- Qingdao, famously known as the home of Tsingtao Beer and fine beaches, has found another way to attract tourists -- plants. The coastal city on China's eastern Shandong Province is hosting the 2014 International Horticultural Expo. The Expo, which opened on April 25, is expected to attract 12 million visitors before it closes on October 25. With the theme ""From the Earth, For the Earth,"" it features gardens and pavilions specially constructed on one end of the Laoshan Mountain, one of the most sacred Taoist destinations in China. ""This event is an opportunity to promote the image of our city, exchange experiences on horticultural techniques and products across the globe and raise public awareness on ecological and environmental protection,"" said Expo organizer Zhu Yuetao. Once a mining region, the Expo area has been transformed into a 241-hectare Disneyland-style complex featuring exhibits, water parks, rides and live performances. ""People from all over the world will come to Qingdao, and when they see what I have seen, they will be delighted,"" said Tim Briercliffe, secretary general of the International Association of Horticultural Producers. ""Millions of people will be inspired and the benefits will be enjoyed today and by future generations."" Rare plants on display . Qingdao has invited plant lovers and garden experts from 37 countries and regions, as well as Chinese provinces and cities, which have set up various pavilions. It's even attracted the participation of the North Koreans, who have brought samples of Kimilsunglia and Kimjongilia orchids, named after late leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. Another pavilion displays nearly 2,000 rare or new strains of plants, including specimens from tropical and temperate zones. Another special attraction is the Swedish pavilion, which highlights the life of Swedish scientist Carl von Linne, father of modern botany and taxonomy. Visitors can hit up the Ice Bar, which recreates a visit to Sweden's famed Ice Hotel. ""The whole bar is made of ice and inside you will be given provisional parkas and gloves so you can lift a nonalcoholic drink from a glass also made of ice,"" said Lars Freden, Sweden's ambassador to China. ""The Expo is one of the biggest exhibitions in China now, and I personally love Qingdao."" Freden first visited the city in 1980. From 'shabby' mines to ecological wonders . Organizers say the Expo is meant to promote innovation in city planning and popularize a healthy, eco-friendly lifestyle. A section of the Expo is dedicated to eco-friendly technologies, such as an energy-saving water recycling system and waste-processing technologies. A botanical garden was designed to operate with a low carbon climate control system to regulate temperature for various plant-growing climates. The Expo is credited with transforming the site, which used to be dotted with mining pits notorious for degrading land and vegetation. ""By turning this shabby mining zone into an ecological city, we hope that both the city and the public will be more aware of how to maintain the balance between people and nature,"" said Jiang Zehui, a Beijing-based official who attended the opening ceremony. Organizers say events such as the Expo benefit tourists and local residents alike. ""As you can see, the trash is gone, the road is clean,"" said Wu Zhiqiang, an urban planning professor of Shanghai's Tongji University and the chief Expo designer. Wu was one of the main designers of the Shanghai Expo in 2008. Visitor info . Tickets to the Expo range from 60 yuan (about $10) for evening admission to 120 yuan for single-day admission. Tourists can also get group and student passes. Cable cars and electric golf carts are available for a fee.

"(CNN) -- I didn't want to start my new job as the president of a national pro-choice organization by taking a close look at the shocking case of Dr. Kermit Gosnell. I couldn't avoid the ugly truth of Gosnell's actions, and like everyone else, I recoiled in horror when I learned what he had done. On Monday, Gosnell was found guilty of three counts of first-degree murder. As a nation, we can't afford to miss the critically important lessons of this case. And when I saw the anti-abortion movement twisting those lessons for their own political agenda, angling for policies that would put even more women in danger, I had to speak up. Gosnell will be sentenced for the murder of three infants and homicide of a patient through lethal doses of painkillers. Let's be clear: Murder is illegal in all 50 states, and his sentencing should reflect the gravity of these crimes. Gosnell also ignored the standards of care and safety recognized as best practices by medical professionals who provide abortion care. That he was allowed to operate for so long -- despite multiple complaints -- was a failure of the authorities to enforce the laws on the books. His willful neglect of the law and of the women who went to him for help is egregious and is exactly the kind of crime that the pro-choice movement has sought to end by bringing abortion care above ground since Roe v. Wade was adjudicated in 1973. Why is this so important? Because anti-abortion activists would have the public believe the exact opposite. They are exploiting the Gosnell case to boost their 40-year-old agenda to ban abortion altogether. These opportunists are shamelessly using the case of these victimized women to take even more control away from our ability to make private decisions about how, when, and with whom we have families. In NARAL Pro-Choice America's annual evaluation of reproductive rights in the 50 states, Pennsylvania received an ""F"" because of the obstacles and roadblocks politicians have put in front of women seeking safe and legal abortion care. Pennsylvania, along with 32 other states and the District of Columbia, blocks abortion care for low-income women who receive their care from the state's Medicaid program. Denying women this care until they can raise the money to pay out of pocket can force them to seek abortion later in their pregnancies and drive them into the clutches of back-alley providers such as Gosnell, who offer them substandard care. More tellingly, Pennsylvania has also pushed Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers laws, which are on the front lines of efforts to end abortion care once and for all. These TRAP laws, always proposed by anti-choice extremists, zero in on clinics that provide abortion and hit them with a series of expensive, medically unnecessary and nit-picking rules designed to push them out of business, while ignoring clinics that provide other medical services with much higher risks of complication. TRAP laws often come with ridiculous rules for such things as the height of the grass, the number of parking spaces and awning widths at abortion clinics. NARAL Pro-Choice America members, along with most Americans, support the fair implementation of regulations among all medical providers that are carefully designed to keep patients safe. However, the motivation behind TRAP laws is clear: to shut down abortion clinics. And what's disturbing is, they're working. Over the years, there has been a significant decline in the number of abortion providers in Pennsylvania and across this country. In Mississippi, Alabama and South Dakota, runaway restrictions have driven out all but one provider in each state. When these clinics are driven out of business, it is the most economically vulnerable women who pay the price. These women are the ones who lose access to critical medical services such as cancer-screening, check-ups and even prenatal care also provided at these clinics. Let's remember Gosnell is also a symptom of how hard it is for low-income women to get quality health care, period. TRAP laws are just the beginning for anti-choice extremists, who have made no secret that they will stop at nothing to ban abortion completely. Earlier this year, Arkansas became the first state to ban the procedure at 12 weeks of pregnancy. Not to be outdone, North Dakota enacted a six-week ban on abortion -- that's before most women even know they are pregnant. If TRAP laws are a back-door ban to abortion, these near-total bans are your anti-choice neighbors barging uninvited through your front door. None of these efforts -- TRAP laws or outright bans -- will reduce the number of abortion procedures. A Guttmacher Institute study found similar abortion rates in countries where abortion is illegal and where it is legal. But the study showed that when countries limit legal access, more women die. That brings us back to Gosnell. His clinic operated in violation of basic health and safety standards; his practices were abhorrent. If we allow political extremists to exploit this case to impose more TRAP laws and abortion bans, the remaining safe and legal abortion providers could be forced to shut their doors. No one cares more about the safety of women more than the members of the pro-choice movement. In fact, it was the stories -- daily stories -- of horrors women faced from unregulated, unsafe, unsanitary procedures that shocked a nation into action back in the days when abortion was illegal. Women, regardless of their background, deserve access to high-quality health care. Women deserve the opportunity to determine if and when they want to have families. Women deserve the dignity of controlling their own lives and, without a doubt, women deserve a lot better than the likes of Kermit Gosnell.

"(CNN) -- G. Todd Baugh, the Montana judge who drew a firestorm of criticism after sentencing a former high school teacher to a month behind bars for raping a 14-year-old girl, is the subject of a formal complaint from a judicial review board to the state's Supreme Court. An attorney for the Judicial Standards Commission filed the four-page document on Monday, saying Baugh ""eroded public confidence"" in the judicial system and ""created an appearance of impropriety."" Malin Stearns Johnson said Baugh's actions in the case of Stacey Dean Rambold warrant disciplinary action, but Johnson didn't recommend a specific penalty. Last month, Baugh, 72, announced his retirement at the end of the year, when his term ends. He said his retirement was unrelated to the case, in which he ordered Rambold to serve 31 days in jail and more than 14 years on probation for the rape of the student who later committed suicide. Baugh acknowledged making controversial remarks about victim Cherise Morales at Rambold's sentencing in August. According to the Montana attorney general's office, the judge said she looked older than her years and was ""probably as much in control of the situation as was the defendant."" Morales committed suicide in February 2010. ""I am sorry I made those remarks,"" the judge wrote to the commission in November. ""They focused on the victim when that aspect of the case should have been focused on the defendant."" Baugh said he weighed all relevant factors in passing sentence. ""The defendant's last legal or moral transgression was the crime he committed and admitted,"" he wrote. ""In the ensuing almost six years, he had legally and morally good conduct, he was reinstated in sex offender treatment and the undisputed evidence supported community placement and treatment."" The length of the sentence, Baugh's comments and the age disparity between defendant and victim drew criticism and a firestorm of media attention. The Montana attorney general's office in November appealed the 31-day sentence, saying it did not meet the state's mandatory minimum sentence. Rambold had sexual relations with Morales in fall 2007, when she was 14 and a student in one of his classes at Billings Senior High in Billings. She confided in a church group leader and Rambold was charged in October 2008 with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent. He was released from jail in September and is on probation until August 2028.","G. Todd Baugh has apologized and also said he will retire this year .

"(CNN) -- The London-based leader of one of Pakistan's most powerful regional parties was arrested at his home Tuesday in connection with a money laundering probe, officials of his party said. Altaf Hussain, leader of Pakistan's Mutahida Qaumi Movement, was arrested by London's Metropolitan Police, MQM Senior Deputy Gov. Nadeem Nusrat told reporters in Pakistan. Hussain, 60, leads MQM from the United Kingdom, where he sought political asylum in 1991. MQM is the fourth-largest party in the Pakistani Parliament, holding 25 out of 446 seats, though it is a greater force in Sindh province, including Pakistan's largest city, Karachi. Metropolitan Police said they arrested a 60-year-old man at a home in northwest London on suspicion of money laundering Tuesday morning, but they did not release his name. Hussain has been ill and was preparing to leave his home to get checked at a hospital when he was arrested, Nusrat said. ""Workers and supporters all over the world, including Pakistan, are very concerned and worried for his welfare,"" Nusrat told reporters. Metropolitan Police said the man they arrested ""has an existing medical condition,"" and that they were taking him to a hospital for a previously scheduled medical appointment. ""He will remain in custody of officers throughout,"" the police said in a written statement. Details of the money laundering allegations weren't immediately available. Faisal Subzwari, a senior MQM politician, told CNN the party is cooperating with the Metropolitan Police investigation. After news of the arrest, MQM called for protests in Karachi, which turned violent. The party condemned the violence, blaming ""miscreants,"" who have nothing to do with MQM, for what happened. The Prime Minister's office similarly condemned the violence. ""Though, people are restive over the arrest, Law does not warrant the loss of people's lives and properties on the pretext of reaction to the incident. The Prime Minister has directed the Government of Sindh and the law enforcement agencies to ensure the safety of lives and properties of people in Karachi,"" it said in a statement. MQM is based in Karachi and is a force in Sindh province's politics. It has the second-largest contingent in the provincial assembly, with 37 out of 130 seats. It styles itself as a voice for the downtrodden, the middle class and immigrants from nearby India, but political rivals accuse the party of using heavy-handed tactics, including intimidation, to stay in power. Hussain sought political asylum in the United Kingdom in 1991 because of an attempt on his life, the party has previously said.","NEW: MQM and the office of Pakistan's Prime Minister condemn violence in Karachi .

"(CNN) -- Researchers  at Qatar  University's engineering  school have come up with a novel way to cool the stadiums ahead of the 2022  World Cup... giant flying saucers! Actually,  they have announced plans to develop giant artificial remotely controlled  ""clouds"" made up of high-tech materials that will be positioned between the  blistering sun and the still-to-be-built football stadiums in the Gulf emirate. Dr. Saud  Ghani, head of a Mechanical and Industrial Engineering group at Qatar University, tells CNN that the artificial robotic cloud could potentially drop the  temperatures on the pitch by 10 degrees Fahrenheit. That's a  big deal in a country where temperatures in summer regularly soar into  triple-digits Fahrenheit -- the very time the 2022 tournament is expected to take  place. Ghani  says that the design has passed the initial engineering phase and his team plan  to make a 4-by-3 meter prototype by the end of this year to test the  concept. The  finished product would be a rectangle made up of carbon fiber and solar panels  the size of a jumbo jet.  It would use sophisticated monitoring gear to track  the transit of the sun and would use four electric powered engines to maneuver  to the precisely the right position to drop a cool shade across the  stadiums. Ghani  believes that the technology could also be useful in security and  communications.  Radio and camera transmitters could help facilitate wireless  communication and provide an eye-in-the-sky for broadcasters or security  forces. His team  eventually hopes to construct the helium-filled devices in Qatar,  and the final price for each unit could be as low as $500,000,  Ghani  predicted.","World Cup comes to Qatar in 2022 .

"(CNN) -- Like giddy teenagers, Republican activists have fallen for another charming, personable and accomplished black conservative. Dr. Ben Carson is the newest object of their crush, which was born of a desperate need to attract more black men and women as high-profile standard-bearers. You can't blame Republican loyalists for swooning over the doc, a renowned surgeon who rose from poverty to head pediatric neurosurgery at Baltimore's famed Johns Hopkins Hospital. If wooing voters of color were simply a matter of finding an attractive black face with an inspiring personal story and an impressive resume, Carson would be hard to beat. But black voters tend to be more discerning than that. They have shown an unerring instinct for rejecting condescension and dismissing tokenism. There are many black Americans who admire Carson for his professional accomplishments (I'm one of them), but that admiration is unlikely to translate into votes. One of the reasons is that Carson doesn't seem to know black Americans' political values very well. In his most recent book -- a political tract called ""America the Beautiful: Rediscovering What Made This Nation Great"" -- he writes: ""Many African-Americans voted for Obama simply because he was a black man and not because they resonated philosophically with his policies."" In fact, black voters have been increasingly allied with the Democratic Party since the 1960s when Lyndon Johnson pushed through significant civil rights legislation. Al Gore received about 95% of the black vote in 2000, John Kerry about 93% in 2004. Moreover, Carson seems to have adopted the view, popular among so many ultra-conservatives, that the Democratic Party appeals to voters who shun the work ethic. Talking to The New York Times recently about his conservative views, Carson described himself as a ""flaming liberal"" in college who later became disaffected with the Democratic Party. ""One thing I always believed strongly in was personal responsibility and hard work,"" he said. ""I found the Democrat Party leaving me behind on that particular issue."" That notion -- fallacious though it is -- is at least as popular among black conservatives as among white ones. I've been hearing it from black Republicans for at least two decades. Several years ago, I interviewed a black conservative running a doomed campaign for a suburban Atlanta congressional district. She had no prior political experience, no policies to advance, no program to sell. Her platform consisted of her belief in hard work, which she contrasted, at least implicitly, with black Democrats' supposed preference for sloth. That view is as puzzling as it is infuriating. It may charm those white conservatives who hold stereotypical views of black Americans, but it bears little resemblance to the realities that inform their choices at the ballot box. In his memoir, ""Gifted Hands,"" and in his motivational speeches, Carson talks about his impoverished childhood and his remarkable semiliterate mother. Married at 13 only to later divorce her philandering husband, she enforced high academic standards for Carson and his brother while working two or three jobs as a maid or nanny -- and battling debilitating depression. Carson eventually got into Yale and became, at 33, the youngest person to head a department at Johns Hopkins Hospital. He is famous for separating conjoined twins. That's a compelling and powerful tale. But it differs from those of other hardworking black people I know only in the degree of success that Carson attained as a result, not in the measures of ambition, industriousness, discipline and self-respect his mother instilled in her children. Yet black Americans know better than to believe those traits are enough to guarantee success. History taught us better. Just look back over the last decade and a half. In 2000, according to the U.S. census, less than a quarter of black Americans -- 22.5% -- lived in poverty. By 2010, that number had risen to 27.4%. Was there a sudden outbreak of indolence among black folk over that period? Or were there outside forces that conspired to knock them back down the economic ladder? As long as the Republican Party refuses to acknowledge that, it will have little to offer workers of color -- and declining appeal to younger whites. They, too, understand the limits of self-reliance. To be helpful to the GOP, Carson would have to remind them of the caprice of capitalism and the generational reach of racism's barriers. Instead, he sounds like the standard-issue Ayn Rand acolyte, no different from Mitt Romney or Paul Ryan. He opposes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and supports a flat tax. For good measure, he's also a religious conservative who disputes evolution. It's no wonder that conservatives have started to trumpet him as their Great Black Hope. Psychologists believe that romantic interest increases when people mirror each other's gestures. Carson perfectly reflects the beliefs of his suitors. Still, this romance is unlikely to blossom into a long-lasting love affair. There are too many misunderstandings, too many unspoken expectations, too many half-baked assumptions. And some of those half-based assumptions are Carson's. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cynthia Tucker.","Cynthia Tucker: Republicans are desperate for more high-profile black candidates .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- A year ago, Ibrahim Qobani was an idealistic 19-year-old revolutionary who sang about freedom. Always dressed in a scarf and fingerless gloves woven with the colors of the Syrian rebel flag, Qobani worked with a team of pro-democracy activists in Syria's northern Idlib province. He would sing from the rooftops during boisterous anti-government protests, complete with humorous animations that begged the international community to help stop Syrian government atrocities. But today, Qobani appears much different in a series of YouTube videos. Gone is the scarf with colors of the rebel flag. Instead of leading the chants, the young man stands in the crowd smiling as one man sings, ""We destroyed America with a civilian plane, turned the World Trade Center into a pile of dirt. If you call me a terrorist, I say it's an honor."" In another video, Qobani stands cheering with a crowd of bearded men as a little boy sings, ""Our commander is Bin Laden. He showed the Americans the strength of our faith."" A man gives the boy a knife, which he proceeds to slice through the air as he sings, ""Our police is Nusra. Just wait Alawites. We will come to slaughter you."" It was a chilling warning to the minority religious sect of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has stacked the top ranks of his security forces with fellow Alawites. Qobani declined several requests to speak with CNN. Several of his friends, however, confirmed that he is now a member of Jabhat al-Nusra, or the Nusra Front, the most famous of the hard-line Islamist rebel groups now fighting against the Syrian regime. Qobani's ideological evolution is symbolic of a broader shift that many Syrians say they're seeing nearly two years after the anti-government uprising began. ""There is an increasing militarization and now increased radicalization of the revolution,"" said Rafif Jouejati. She is the English spokeswoman for the Local Coordination Committees in Syria, one of the first groups to organize peaceful anti-government protests in the spring of 2011. ""Jabhat al-Nusra continues to make gains,"" Jouejati said. ""They continue to increase in popularity, particularly as they begin to implement social services."" In the last year, the Nusra Front has grown from a shadowy group claiming responsibility for deadly car bombs to what Syrians describe as a highly disciplined fighting force that continues to attract recruits from the more secular Free Syrian Army rebels. Nusra Front fighters are said to be leading the ongoing siege of the Khweiris military airbase in Aleppo province. They are also credited with helping lead the capture of the Taftanaz helicopter airbase in Idlib province last month. Opinion: Terrorist group fills power vacuum among Syria rebels . The high-profile Islamist victories on the battlefield have been accompanied by another trend. Gradually, black Islamist banners have replaced the distinctive green, black, white and red flags of the Syrian rebels at weekly anti-government protests. ""After two years of killings and butchering and the entire world standing by and watching us, now we depend on God only. So we started raising the banner of Shahada, the black banner of war,"" explained a Syrian activist who has spent much of the last two years organizing anti-government protests in Idlib province. The Shahada refers to the Islamic creed ""There is no god but God, Mohammed is the messenger of God."" It is one of the most important pillars of Islam. It is also invoked for martyrdom on the battlefield. The rapid rise of hard-line Sunni Muslim groups like the Nusra Front -- some of which have seen their ranks swelled by foreign jihadi fighters -- is a trend that makes Jouejati and other more secular revolutionaries deeply uncomfortable. It is also making Washington uneasy. In December, the U.S. government blacklisted the Nusra Front, labeling it a terrorist organization. ""We blacklisted the Nusra Front because of its intimate links with al Qaeda in Iraq ... which is responsible for the killing of thousands of Iraqis and hundreds of Americans,"" said Robert Ford, the U.S. ambassador to Syria, in an interview with CNN last month. ""We know what al Qaeda in Iraq did and is still doing, and we don't want it to start doing that in Syria."" But some Syrian opposition leaders blame Western inaction for the recent growth of the Islamist groups. ""The U.S. and the European Union didn't help us, and that created an increase in Islamic radicalism here,"" said Marwan Gayed in an interview in Aleppo last month. Gayed was a judge who defected from the Syrian government and helped launch the United Courts Council, an opposition-run court that is trying to institute law and order in rebel-controlled parts of Aleppo. Like many in the opposition, Gayed has viewed Islamist groups like Nusra as uneasy partners in the campaign to overthrow the al-Assad regime. ""They are our brothers in the revolution. They bleed for it. But we differ on how to build the state,"" explained Gayed, who now serves as the chief prosecutor for the United Courts Council. ""We call for a civil, democratic nation. They call for an Islamic state."" U.S. branding of al-Nusra may have unintended consequences . Members of the Nusra Front declined to meet face to face with CNN journalists. Instead, Salem Sabbagh, the spokesman for the Nusra Front in Aleppo, answered several questions submitted in print. He wrote that the main object of the group in Syria was ""to establish an Islamic state that can be based on the principles of the shura (consultations) where righteousness and justice will prevail based on applying God's laws."" ""We already started carrying out God's law in some of the liberated areas,"" Sabbagh added. ""And we noted a great reception among the people when it comes to these religious courts, especially when they discovered that these courts were not as some portrayed and tried to distort their reality that such a court system will enslave them and that their heads will be severed and that their only salvation is when they choose a secular Western-oriented system that can rule among them."" Competition between the United Courts Council and courts backed by the Nusra Front exploded this month. On Tuesday, the council accused Nusra Front fighters of raiding one of its courthouses in Aleppo. ""Jabhat Al-Nusra stormed the Second Circuit United Judicial Council and seized the building of the Council and attacked scholars and judges who were there and they beat them and insulted them and then they kidnapped them to Jabhat al-Nusra's headquarters,"" said the council in a written statement also signed by a group calling itself the Free Aleppo Lawyers. Rebel court fills void amid Syrian war . It is not the first time tensions have flared between the Nusra Front and other revolutionaries. One of Aleppo's most famous anti-government activists, a man known as Abu Maryam, told CNN he was briefly detained and flogged by Islamist fighters last week. After his release, Abu Maryam posted a photo on Facebook of his bruised back. ""They accused me of protesting against the caliphate,"" Abu Maryam said in a brief interview with CNN. Asked whether he thought the Nusra Front was taking over Syria's uprising, Abu Maryam said, ""Yes, of course, that's true, but it's all because of the mistakes of the Free Syrian Army."" Nearly two years into the uprising, the rebel Free Syrian Army continues to be dogged by accusations of corruption. In recent weeks, activists have mounted an online campaign accusing Ahmed Afash, a prominent commander based in Aleppo, of banditry and kidnapping. Afash has denied the charges. But last week, a detachment of Afash's fighters raided the offices of the Aleppo Media Center. They briefly detained several Syrian journalists who had published reports that Afash's brigade had killed an innocent civilian. Meanwhile, Islamist groups like the Nusra Front have been applauded for distributing food and fuel to hungry, freezing Syrians. The Nusra Front also launched a cheap public service in rebel-controlled parts of Aleppo. ""Not only do they do the fighting, but they also perform a lot of civil duties such as cleaning roads, manning bakeries, installing and repairing city infrastructure like electricity,"" said the activist from Idlib province, who asked not to be named. ""Some of the Nusra Front members are now playing even the role of street cleaners because of garbage in the city that has increased the rat population."" Even Syrians who criticize the Nusra Front concede the Islamists have offered hope to some members of a society traumatized by a brutal conflict that has claimed more than 70,000 lives and left millions of people homeless. As Islamists within the uprising continue to attract support, leaders of the Free Syrian Army have been left fuming, blaming a lack of Western engagement for the ideological shift in the uprising. ""We see the Islamist factions gaining more ground, recruiting some of our own people,"" said Louai Miqdad, a spokesman for the Free Syrian Army. ""The world is handing Syria over to the unknown, to the radicals, to the Islamists.""","Hard-line Islamist groups like the Nusra Front are becoming more popular in Syria .

"(CNN) -- Four years ago Liu Wen entered a modeling contest in China to win a computer to use for school. Little did she know it would lead her to the Victoria's Secret runway in New York. Wen, who will appear in the Victoria's Secret fashion show airing Tuesday on CBS, will be the first Victoria's Secret model of Asian descent to walk the catwalk, the company said. ""I was surprised when my agent told me,"" Wen said hours before she was set to walk the runway. She seemed only slightly overwhelmed: clad in a pink robe, one technician assigned to her fingernails, another to her toenails and another adding extensions to her already long black hair. ""I asked my agent if she was joking. I didn't think an Asian girl would get this job."" Victoria's Secret plucked Wen, 21, out of a regular model casting call. ""Liu Wen is a beautiful woman. She has a strong and energetic presence on the runway. She looked absolutely stunning in our fashion show,"" said the show's executive producer, Monica Mitro. At 5-foot-10, Wen said she towered over her classmates in China. The newest addition to the Victoria's Secret family was born in Yongzhou in China's Hunan province in 1988, the daughter of an interior designer dad and a stay-at-home mom. She was in high school when, on a whim, she submitted photos for a modeling contest, hoping to win the top prize of a laptop computer. ""I was studying to be a teacher in China and my friend was entering a modeling contest,"" she said. ""The prize was a computer, and I needed a computer for school. So I entered the contest, too, and then I won."" Her family and friends, including the one who originally had the idea to enter the contest, were shocked. ""My friends were all surprised,"" she said. ""They were all like, 'sure, you're pretty.' "" Soon Wen had moved from Yongzhou to the Chinese capital of Beijing, where she appeared on the covers of  Chinese editions of FHM and Marie Claire, as well as in editorials for Chinese Vogue. In 2008 she landed on the cover of Chinese Elle alongside fellow rising star Emma Pei. Wen made her runway debut in Milan, Italy, in 2008, followed quickly by Paris, France, and New York fashion weeks where she walked in such shows as Anna Sui, Dolce & Gabbana, Alexander McQueen, Chloé and Lanvin. Although her walk down the runway will be a first for Victoria's Secret, Wen is part of a growing trend for Asian models worldwide that began several years ago with Devon Aoki. The past few seasons of fashion shows have featured Asian models on almost every high-end runway. ""I talk to my mom in China every day when I am traveling. My family is always excited to hear about the top designers I am meeting and the clothes I get to wear,"" Wen said. She said was familiar with the Victoria's Secret show, though being on the inside was something new. ""Of course I had seen the show on television. I watched it every year,"" Wen said. ""But it was so different when I got here and got to meet the other girls. I got to meet Heidi Klum for the first time after I had known about her for so long. And she was so nice."" Wen thinks she may try her hand at acting when she has gotten over the modeling bug, but she said she would be just as happy returning to China to be a teacher like she originally planned. ""In the classroom everyone respects the teacher. The teacher has all the control and has the ability to shape all of her students' lives,"" Wen said. ""But for now modeling is such great fun. I'm still trying out new sexy faces.""","Liu Wen will be the first Victoria's Secret runway model of Asian descent .

"Jaipur, India (CNN) -- How did buildings keep cool before the invention of air conditioning? As architects consider how to reduce the energy demands of new builds, some are turning to the past for simple, low-tech solutions. At the height of summer, in the sweltering industrial suburbs of Jaipur, Rajasthan in north-west India, the Pearl Academy of Fashion remains 20 degrees cooler inside than out -- by drawing on Rajasthan's ancient architecture. While the exterior appears very much in keeping with the trends of contemporary design, at the base of the building is a vast pool of water -- a cooling concept taken directly from the stepwell structures developed locally over 1,500 years ago to provide refuge from the desert heat. Award-winning architect Manit Rastogi, who designed the academy, explains that baoli -- the Hindi word for stepwell -- are bodies of water encased by a descending set of steps. ""When water evaporates in heat, it immediately brings down the temperature of the space around it,"" he says. While traditional stepwells often go many stories below ground level, Rastogi's go down just four meters. However, the effect is the same and -- like the ancient Mughal palaces before it -- the academy enjoys its own microclimate. Read more from Road to Rio: The slums of Mumbai: A model of urban sustainability? Rastogi wonders: ""How did they think up something so elaborate and yet so simple in its basic philosophy? ""How do you begin to think that you can dig into the ground and use the earth as a heat sink, have access to water, put a pavilion into it so that its comfortable through the year? It takes a lot of technology for us to think up something that simple now."" But it's not just the stepwells that are involved in this process of ""passive cooling"" -- the general term applied to technologies or design features that cool buildings without power consumption. The whole building is raised above the ground on pillars, creating an airy and shaded pavilion that is used as a recreation and exhibition space. Here, according to Rastogi, the walls are made from a heat-absorbing material that creates a ""thermal bank"" -- so the warmth is slowly released at night when the temperature drops. Centuries ago, latticed screens or ""jaali"" filtered direct sunlight into the palaces. The effect was decorative and helped reduce the heat. Likewise at The Pearl Academy, a latticed concrete screen runs the length of the building and provides a cooling outer skin. ""We've been able to demonstrate that good green building is not only cheaper to run; it's not only more comfortable to live in -- it's also cheaper to build,"" says Rastogi. The success of the academy's eco-design has had an impact. Regulations -- based on these passive cooling techniques -- were introduced last year for all new Indian government buildings.","Architect has adapted India's ancient stepwell architecture for a modern, sustainable building .

"(CNN) -- Connie Cox avoided bariatric surgery for years. The registered dietician knew how to lose weight -- she had done it time and again, dropping more than 75 pounds before gaining it all back. ""The difficulty was in maintaining that loss,"" she says. ""I'd pretty much given up because it was just so heart-breaking."" Cox realized she couldn't do it with diet and exercise alone. She was 5-foot-3 and 293 pounds, and she saw her weight as a professional embarrassment. She decided to undergo a gastric bypass procedure. Within a week after surgery, Cox no longer had to take insulin for her type 2 diabetes. In a month, she was off her blood pressure medication. Over the next several years Cox lost half her body weight, eventually settling at a comfortable 160 pounds. ""Bariatric surgery carries risk, just like any surgical procedure,"" Cox says. ""But I decided for me, the risk of staying at 293 pounds was also very high."" Once feared by patients and denounced by primary care physicians, bariatric surgery has become more accepted as research shows it's not only helping people lose weight, but also reducing their risk for cardiovascular disease and reversing type 2 diabetes. Severely obese adults who undergo gastric bypass lose, on average, 90 pounds in the three years after surgery -- or 31% of their initial weight, according to a study published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Those who have the adjustable gastric band, or LAP-BAND, procedure lose about 44 pounds. Previous research suggests some of these patients will gain back a portion of the weight over time, but the overall health benefits of bariatric surgery are appealing to many struggling with excess weight. ""People lose sight of the fact that the patients aren't just obese, but they're sick,"" bariatric surgeon Dr. Alan Wittgrove says. ""It's not as easy as just losing weight."" No longer a risky business . Twenty years ago, Wittgrove performed the first laparoscopic gastric bypass procedure. It was 1993, and up until that point bariatric surgery had been done through a large incision in the patient's abdomen. Doctors had to cut through a thick wall of fat, Wittgrove says, creating an unstable wound that often led to infections, hernias and sometimes death. ""It was big surgery on big patients,"" says Dr. Jaime Ponce, president of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. ""It really put on a stigma at that time."" Wittgrove's ground-breaking operation changed all that. More than 90% of bariatric procedures are now minimally invasive, and in-hospital mortality rates have dropped to 0.10%, according to a 2011 study published in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons. Ponce says laparoscopic bariatric surgery is now as safe as or safer than gallbladder removal, one of the most routine surgical procedures in America. Fewer risks means less fear for obese patients, Ponce says. In the early 1990s, approximately 16,000 people a year were undergoing bariatric surgery. By 2004, that number had jumped to 135,985 cases per year, according to the 2011 ACS study. Since then, surgeons have seen a steady number of patients, Ponce says, although early numbers for 2013 suggest another uptick. Physicians are also jumping on board as they see that bariatric surgery is about more than weight loss, Wittgrove says. ""We're seeing more primary care doctors that truly understand the power of these operations,"" he says. ""I think society in general understands that this is the best treatment for metabolic syndrome."" How bariatric surgery works . Bariatric surgery works in two ways: by limiting the amount of food patients can consume and/or by preventing patients' digestive systems from absorbing some nutrients. The procedures also affect the body's metabolic hormones, such as ghrelin, which stimulate appetite. Most people have heard of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure, which was developed in the 1960s. With gastric bypass, doctors create a smaller stomach pouch that can hold only an ounce of food and connect it to a new section of the small intestine, bypassing part of that digestive organ. Learning to eat again: Man drops 130 pounds . Also popular is the adjustable gastric banding procedure, more commonly referred to as the LAP-BAND. Doctors place the LAP-BAND around a portion of the patient's stomach to create a smaller pouch, similar to the gastric bypass procedure. This band can then be tightened or loosened via a port below the skin of the patient's abdomen. Unlike the gastric bypass procedure, the LAP-BAND is reversible. Two other bariatric procedures are also performed in the United States. During a sleeve gastrectomy procedure, doctors remove 75% of the patient's stomach, creating a slim tube, or sleeve, that foods travels through. With a biliopancreatic diversion, a portion of the stomach is removed and the remaining tissue is connected to the lower portion of the small intestine. Learn more about the different kinds of bariatric surgery . Doctors have discovered that gastric bypass procedures have a nearly immediate effect on patients with type 2 diabetes. The bypass reroutes the intestine, Ponce explains, allowing food to hit a portion of the bowel that stimulates the pancreas, which then produces more insulin. ""Sometimes patients walk out of the hospital without medications,"" he says. There is also data showing the sleeve, diversion and band can improve or put diabetes into remission, with varying degrees of success. Treating a disease . Earlier this year, the American Medical Association officially labeled obesity as a disease. Many saw the AMA's decision as a step toward getting health insurance companies to accept bariatric surgery as a viable treatment for metabolic disorders like diabetes. Although stigma around bariatric surgery has been reduced, it still exists, Cox says. ""There's still that feeling that it's drastic, that it's dangerous,"" she says. ""Some people call it the easy way out. And there's nothing easy about having your insides rerouted."" Wittgrove wonders if we'd have such a negative view of bariatric surgery if obesity wasn't viewed as a lazy person's disease. We would never judge someone going into surgery to have cancer removed, he says, so why do we judge those trying to reverse their diabetes or heart disease? ""The reality is the 10-year survival rate for some individuals with metabolic disease is less than if they have some cancers,"" he says. ""I don't think (bariatric surgery) is a radical treatment. I think it's shown to be the best treatment."" If anything shows how perception is changing, Ponce says, it's the name of his professional organization. In 2007, the American Society for Bariatric Surgery became the American Society for Metabolic & Bariatric Surgery, acknowledging the impact bariatric surgery can have on metabolic disorders. Researchers around the globe are following bariatric patients to see if the effects of surgery stick. Scientists in Sweden have collected data on 2,000 patients for more than a decade. Nearly 72% of their bariatric patients were in remission for type 2 diabetes two years after surgery, compared to just 16.4% of non-surgical weight loss patients. But 15 years later, only 31% of the surgical patients were still in remission. While the researchers noted that this was still higher than the remission rate for those who hadn't had surgery, their results illustrate an important point: . ""Bariatric surgery is not a 'one size fits all' approach to weight loss,"" says Dr. Anita Courcoulas, lead author of the new JAMA study. Courcoulas and her colleagues found their results varied widely between patients. More than 70 needed additional bariatric surgery after their first procedure; three died in the month following a gastric bypass. More research is needed to determine which patients will be the most likely to benefit from bariatric surgery, the scientists say. ""It's not as predictable as we'd like it to be,"" Wittgrove says. ""It works well in some patients, doesn't in others. We don't really know who's going to be a successful candidate."" All Cox knows is that she made the right choice for her. She's been able to keep the weight off successfully for 10 years. ""I was looking at a very shortened lifespan,"" she says. ""I have no doubt that I'm going to live 10, 15 years longer because I've undergone this procedure.""

"(CNN) -- Things aren't looking good for people with allergies in Tennessee. Not only is the pollen apocalypse on its way, three of the state's major cities made the Asthma and Allergy Foundation's annual list of the 10 worst places for spring allergy sufferers. These so-called allergy capitals are ranked based on pollen levels, use of allergy medications and the number of board-certified allergists in the areas, according to a foundation statement. Everyone in the United States can expect their allergies to be worse this year, thanks to an unusually wet winter, the foundation says. ""Severe weather patterns can bring higher temperatures, higher pollen levels and increased exposure to mold, resulting in spring allergies that can peak stronger and last longer,"" Dr. Bill Berger, a California allergist, said in the statement. Here are the top 10 worst allergy cities for 2013: . 1. Jackson, Mississippi . 2. Knoxville, Tennessee . 3. Chattanooga, Tennessee . 4. McAllen, Texas . 5. Louisville, Kentucky . 6. Wichita, Kansas . 7. Dayton, Ohio . 8. Memphis, Tennessee . 9. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma . 10. Baton Rouge, Louisiana . Residents in Springfield, Massachusetts; Buffalo, New York; and Grand Rapids, Michigan, may face more severe cases than they have in years past. These cities all jumped at least 10 spots up on the list from the spring of 2012. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation also releases a list every year of the worst cities for fall allergy sufferers. The spring allergy capitals are based on tree pollen counts, while the fall cities are ranked on ragweed pollen counts from September through November of the previous years. Many of the cities on the fall list are on the spring list, but there are a few differences. 1. Louisville, Kentucky . 2. Wichita, Kansas . 3. Knoxville, Tennessee . 4. Jackson, Mississippi . 5.

"(CNN) -- Garth Brooks offered to ""drop on my knees and beg"" Ireland's prime minister to get his comeback concerts back on track after the Dublin city council denied licenses for two of his five shows. Brooks, speaking at the announcement of a new recording deal with Sony Music, said he had no clue until the last two weeks that there was a problem with the shows, for which 400,000 tickets had been sold. ""I don't have a clue how we got here,"" Brooks said about the sudden cancellation of the sell-out shows. ""All I know is the powers that can fix it are not here."" Garth Brooks hopes friends in high places can save Irish shows . The Dublin shows had been planned for Croke Park Stadium, a football arena that can hold more than 90,000 fans, on five consecutive nights during the last week of July. The council approved Friday, Saturday and Sunday shows, but rejected licenses for Monday and Tuesday night concerts. Instead of going forward with the three approved concerts, Brooks said he would not do any since it would mean choose which 160,000 fans would be shunned. ""If the prime minister himself wants to talk to me, I will crawl, swim, I will fly over there this weekend, sit in front of him, I will drop on my knees and beg for those 400,000 people to let them have fun."" Brooks promised to announce a world tour on July 14 and he hinted that the first new music under his Sony deal would be out around the end of the month. A double album, which he's working on now, will be released around Thanksgiving at ""a stupid price"" initially to reward fans who have waited through his retirement. Brooks was the biggest selling solo recording act ever when he left the road and studio behind to concentrate on raising his three daughters 14 years ago. Fans have only seen him perform since then at a few benefit concerts and a weekend residency in Las Vegas. His youngest daughter Allie graduated from high school in May, relieving Brooks of his paternal duty to drive his kids from his farm in Owasso, Oklahoma, to school each morning and be there for every soccer match.","Brooks says he wold ""crawl, swim"" to Ireland to talk with the prime minister .

"(CNN) -- The Justice Department has decided it won't referee charges -- and countercharges -- of spying between the CIA and the Senate Intelligence Committee. The CIA's general counsel and inspector general each made criminal referrals to the Justice Department seeking an investigation of whether Senate staffers obtained unauthorized access to classified documents related to the agency's now-defunct post-9/11 interrogation program. Soon after, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein went to the Senate floor to accuse the agency of spying on computers used by committee staffers at a CIA facility to investigate the Bush-era interrogation program. Now, the Justice Department has notified the CIA and the Senate committee that it can't find enough evidence to warrant a full-blown probe. ""The department carefully reviewed the matters referred to us and did not find sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal investigation,"" Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said. The CIA declined comment. Feinstein's office didn't immediately comment. Critical report on CIA . The unusual dispute has raised tensions between the agency and lawmakers charged with overseeing its activities. The committee has produced a 6,300-page report on the program, which critics say violated prohibitions on torture and exceeded legal guidance from the Justice Department. The White House and the CIA are reviewing an executive summary of the report to remove classified information before it can be released. The documents that prompted the dispute relate to an internal review by former CIA Director Leon Panetta and, according to the agency, were intended to help summarize material it was providing to the committee for its investigation of the program. The documents were plainly labeled as for internal use and were not supposed to be reviewed by the committee, according to the CIA. Feinstein said Senate staffers found the documents in the course of their work that were put in the computer system either on purpose by a whistleblower or perhaps in error, and that they corroborated some of the committee's findings that the agency now says it disagrees with. She said committee staff routinely sees such documents and didn't violate any classified restrictions. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Thursday he believes the Senate has handled the matter appropriately. ""I think what the CIA did to my senators is wrong. I'm going to drop it at that,"" Reid said. Democratic Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado said, ""I still believe the CIA's entry into our computers was unacceptable perhaps even unconstitutional and we shouldn't let this drop until we have some sort of fundamental resolution of what happened. This wasn't the first time this occurred and the division of powers in our nation's constitution is at some risk here."" Udall said it's time for the White House and the CIA to release the portions of the Senate's report under review. Feinstein is usually one of the intelligence community's staunchest allies in Congress. CIA says it acted properly . CIA Director John Brennan has disputed Feinstein's accusations of agency wrongdoing in uncovering Senate staff access to the internal report. Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in March, he said, ""when the facts come out on this, I think a lot of people who are claiming that there has been this tremendous sort of spying and monitoring and hacking will be proved wrong."" Dean Boyd, a CIA spokesman, said in an op-ed published in USA Today in March that the agency acted properly after it discovered Senate staffers may have accessed and retained sensitive documents stored in a CIA computer network. ""These documents were privileged, deliberative, pre-decisional executive branch material that implicated separation of powers concerns,"" Boyd wrote. ""Because we were concerned that there may have been a breach or vulnerability in the CIA local area network on which CIA stored these documents, CIA information technology specialists were asked to conduct a limited review to determine whether these files were located on the side of the CIA network the committee was authorized to use. That review appeared to confirm the committee's unauthorized access to the documents.""

"(CNN) -- A Pakistani doctor accused of helping the United States find Osama bin Laden has been charged with murder over a surgery that authorities claim he was not authorized to perform, authorities said Friday. Dr. Shakil Afridi, who is in prison awaiting a new trial in connection with the killing of bin Laden, has been accused of performing an appendectomy in 2006 on a boy who died from complications, according to a criminal complaint in Pakistan filed by the boy's mother. The murder charge against Afridi comes just months after a Pakistani judicial commissioner overturned his conviction for his role in the bin Laden killing, which included, among other things, running a fake vaccination trial. He had been sentenced in 2012 to 33 years in prison. Afridi has remained in prison while he awaits a new trial on the charges related to the bin Laden killing. The mother of the boy, Naseeb Gulla, has accused the doctor of performing the wrong surgery, according to the complaint filed in Khyber Agency, one of the eight tribal areas of Pakistan. A December 12 trial date has been set on the charge, according to authorities. The U.S. State Department expressed concern over the new charge brought against Afridi. ""Dr. Afridi's assistance in confirming the location of bin Laden was a service to the entire world and indeed to Pakistanis who had lost loved ones and suffered at the hands of Al Qaeda,"" State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said. ""We call on the proper authorities to ensure that Dr. Afridi receives a fair trial for this new charge."" Pakistani authorities have accused Afridi of working with the CIA to set up a fake vaccination campaign in Abbottabad to try to verify bin Laden's whereabouts. U.S. special forces killed the al Qaeda leader at an Abbottabad compound in May 2011. The vaccination effort, according to allegations in a report filed with a Pakistani appeals court, was meant to collect bin Laden's DNA so the CIA could compare it with samples of bin Laden family DNA that it already had, but no one at his Abbottabad compound agreed to be vaccinated. The report alleged that Afridi admitted receiving $75,800 from handlers for the vaccination effort. In 2012, senior U.S. officials told CNN that Afridi worked with the United States prior to the bin Laden raid, but was never asked to spy on Pakistan and was asked only to help locate al Qaeda terrorists posing a threat to both Pakistan and the United States. After Afridi's imprisonment, then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and then-U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called for his release. Clinton said Afridi ""was instrumental in taking down one of the world's most notorious murderers."" Journalist Zahir Shah Sherazi in Peshawar contributed to this report.","Dr. Shakil Afridi has been charged with murder in connection with a 2006 surgery .

"(CNN) -- You're doing all the obvious things: the right education, solid experience, a good mentor. But those in the C-Suite often confide that it's the subtle ""polish"" that takes the superstar to the next level of success. Small differences can make a big impact. What affects others' perception of your ability to lead a project, a division, an organization, or a movement? Consider the following habits, attitudes, skills, and characteristics of a leader to see how you measure up and then determine how you can step up: . Act with integrity . Tell the truth. Practice the principles you preach. Be genuine and sincere. It takes just one inappropriate action or comment to uncover the counterfeit. And once credibility vanishes, regaining it becomes a monumental task. People want to see the real you -- the integrity behind your face, the actions behind your promises. In today's economic landscape, trust trumps both price and track record. Read more: Steve Jobs: How to lead with purpose . Listen like you mean it . Stop whatever you're doing and look the speaker directly in the eye. Tilt your head slightly to one side. The literal message is, ""I'm giving you an ear."" Ask questions about what the speaker is saying to help clarify thoughts and to verify that you've heard correctly and have drawn the intended conclusions. Answer questions specifically rather than vaguely. Take action to demonstrate that you've heard. Benjamin Disraeli was right when he observed, ""Talk to a man about himself and he will listen for hours."" The magic in this mix? He or she will think you are a remarkable person. Listening increases likeability, and likeability leads back to trust in you as a leader. Commit to what you communicate . Follow through. If you say you'll make an introduction to the potential new client, make the introduction. If you say you'll provide the reference, give the reference. If you say you'll fund the project, budget the money. Show up, own up, and straighten it up. In a marketplace of mealy mouthed moochers, doing what you say will absolutely astonish people. Be accountable for results . Accountability implies risk and reward. You earn rewards for success; you accept penalties for failure. By the very nature of the risk-reward proposition, others' perception of your position and value increases. You've heard it said that money is not the most important thing in life. But that's easier to believe when you have enough of it to cover your basic needs. Likewise, people measure competence in different ways, and ""enough"" competence or ""enough"" intelligence becomes a matter of degree. At some point, people pull you over the ""enough"" threshold and begin to judge your performance on degrees of results. Delivering the goods attracts attention and demands respect that translates into others' perception of your leadership and executive presence. Read more: Leader know thyself . Engage emotionally by being approachable . The combination of both competence and likeability characterizes outstanding leaders with personal presence. You may be credible and have others pick your brain and benefit from your work -- but choose not to be around you if they don't have to be. On the other hand, you may be a likeable, life-of-the-party sort whom everybody wants to hang out with. But people may not consider you credible in challenging times for critical information or competent performance. The tagline ""mover and shaker"" comes from a metaphor -- a very visual component of a personality trait or habit. Not only do leaders move through many networks, work a lot of relationships, and shake their share of hands, they literally take the lead in approaching people. People with presence approach others confidently, act as host, make introductions, and connect others in the group. They approach and give attention to others. Leaders put themselves on the frontline to serve. As a result, others feel their presence because of the attention they give -- not receive. People do pay attention to those with power to reward or punish them. But they enjoy being around those who are humble, willing to serve, and give them the proverbial time of day. Never whine . Constant complaining characterizes losers. The habit follows those who lack success and feel powerless to improve things for themselves. By their very act of whining, people are admitting that they lack the competence, character, communication skills, or commitment to improve things. Not a good message to send. Follow protocol in mixing business with pleasure . Because of the heavy demands on their time, leaders blend their social and work lives, often building their personal relationships through business contacts, and vice versa. As the old saying goes, people do business with people they like. Be the liaison who brings people together over lunch, a golf game, committee work, or causes. Understand the rules of etiquette in each of these situations: introductions; timing and appropriateness of business topics; appropriate dress; who arrives first; who pays. It's these little things done right that shout ""class."" Act with intention. Communicate with confidence. Lead with clarity. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dianna Booher.","Dianna Booher explains key habits, skills, and characteristics of true leaders .

"(CNN) -- His appointment at Bayern Munich was regarded as a something of coup, but less than a year after his arrival in Bavaria the first cracks have appeared in the relationship between Pep Guardiola and the German club. Widely regarded as the best coach in the world, Guardiola joined Bayern last year armed with a footballing philosophy that had brought him world domination during his time at Barcelona. The Spaniard quickly guided Bayern to victories in the club World Cup and the UEFA Super Cup, before securing the German Bundesliga title in record-breaking speed. But after crashing out of the Champions League at the semifinal stage to Real Madrid this week in humiliating fashion, the Spaniard's possession-based style of football has come under criticism. ""If we don't win, it does not help me when Bayern Munich's chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and sporting director Matthias Sammer, are backing me,"" Guardiola told reporters Friday. ""If we lose I'm a risk for the club. It's a big club and you always have to win. If this doesn't happen, the club may decide something else."" Perhaps more worryingly for Guardiola, honorary president Franz Beckenbauer openly expressed his exasperation after Bayern's Champions League exit. ""Bayern are not right,"" Beckenbauer, who both played for and managed Bayern, told Spanish newspaper Marca. ""This is something that we have known for weeks. The disappointment is huge."" But Guardiola is adamant he will not alter his approach, insisting it is down to Bayern to decide if they want him to continue as manager. ""The club must decide whether the coach is the right man for this team,"" said the 43-year-old Spaniard. Bayern's 4-0 home defeat by Real raised questions that Guardiola's team is too tactically predictable. ""I'm a strong person. There was lot of criticism but that's the nature of the beast. Criticism is normal,"" Guardiola said. ""I can't train the players with other coaches' ideas. Even after the defeat [against Madrid] I'm confident in my own ideas. ""Next season, we will play 100% with my ideas. I can't coach this club or its players without believing in my ideas."" Guardiola says he is already planning for life in Munich next season, when he will be hoping to repeat his success on the domestic front, while going those extra steps further in Europe. Despite the setback in Europe, Guardiola could yet win a fourth trophy this season with Bayern playing Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup final on May 17. Later Friday, Karl Hopfner was elected as the new president of the Bavarian giants, succeeding Uli Hoeness, who will serve a three and a half year jail term for tax fraud. Hoeness, who was at the meeting ahead starting his sentence, received a standing ovation from the club members and hinted he would return once he is a free man. ""I made a huge mistake and I will accept that. When I return, I am not going to retire,"" said the 62-year-old Hoeness, who was found guilty of evading $39.5 million of taxes at a trial earlier this year. Hopfner, who is 61, has spent over 30 years in a series of senior positions at Bayern.","Pep Guardiola says Bayern Munich must decide if he is right coach for job .

"(CNN) -- Much like buses coming in twos and threes, Britain found itself Sunday in the unprecedented position of having not just one but two cyclists on the 2012 Tour de France podium. Against the backdrop of the Champs Elysees and resplendent in yellow -- the jersey that denotes the Tour winner -- Bradley Wiggins will deservedly take the plaudits for becoming the first Briton to win the most prestigious cycling race in the world. But the presence of second-placed Froome is testament to an organizational effort that has ensured Team Sky has steamrollered its way past all the opposition. Wiggins claimed his second stage win on the Tour as he sealed his overall victory Saturday in an individual time trial. Froome also won a mountain stage and forged his reputation as a Tour de France winner in his own right in the near future. While their teammate Mark Cavendish sprinted to victory on the final stage in Paris for his third stage victory and 23rd overall on the Tour as Team Sky's domination was complete. Wiggins seals Tour triumph in Paris . How times have changed since Scot Robert Millar was racing on the roads of France. ""There hasn't been a GB winner before because there was no investment in road cycling up until now,"" Millar, who was crowned King of the Mountains and finished fourth in the 1984 Tour, told CNN. ""If you wanted to be a pro rider before it was largely an individual process. There wasn't any back up and very little encouragement from those running the sport. It's only lately it has changed, due to the arrival of government money and sponsorship deals."" When Millar first turned professional with the French team Peugeot in 1980, it was during an era when aspiring British riders had to brave the European amateur scene to achieve their dream. Government funding . It is a different story today. Off the back of growing success on the track, including a 14-medal haul at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, British cycling now receives over $40 million of government funding. ""We invest in Olympic sports with money from National Lottery and government along 'no compromise' principles,"" explained a UK Sport spokesman, ""rewarding success and potential success for the next Olympics. ""The sports basically get all funding except commercial deals from us."" For British road cycling, the breakthrough moment came in 2009 when Team Sky was founded, the country's only professional cycling outfit. Spearheaded by Dave Brailsford, a driving force behind Team GB's eight gold medals in China, Team Sky has produced Britain's first Tour de France winner in only its third attempt at the race. ""When I raced you had to figure out most things for yourself,"" Millar, who raced between 1980 and 1995, explained. ""You received advice from friends and colleagues but the back-up was nothing like Bradley has to call upon. ""Types of training, the whens, hows and whys, diet, dealing with your psychology, they were all subjects you had to untangle yourself. It's taken them a while to understand all those aspects and come up with a plan."" Cycling immortality . Despite his hardships, Millar can take comfort in the fact his struggles paved the way for Wiggins to earn cycling immortality. ""When I started racing I looked at what had been achieved before by GB riders and put that as one of my targets,"" said Millar. ""You can only hope that inspires others to go further than you did. ""I know how much work it took, how much it hurt sometimes and if someone comes along and beats that then I can have nothing but respect for them. There are no easy answers it comes down to hard work, commitment, sacrifices and talent."" Whilst Wiggins, Froome and Cavendish may be making all the headlines for Team Sky at the moment, there is another Briton content to take a backseat role -- for the meantime at least. Alex Dowsett will be competing in his first Grand Tour in Spain next month, and is keen to match the success of his elder compatriots. ""My ambition is to emulate Wiggins and to emulate what he has achieved -- I feel I'm capable of achieving that too."" ""Having those other Brits around me is a big help and inspiration. Wiggins went through the same system that I am in, and he's proven that success is possible. There's no reason that I can't do that when I'm his age."" Wiggins' 2012 challenge was aided by the absence of two cycling superstars. The 2010 champion Andy Schleck missed this year's race with a broken pelvis, while Spain's Alberto Contador is still serving a ban for doping offenses. Doping problems . Doping has cast a long shadow over cycling throughout the history of the sport, with Andy's brother Frank Schleck failing an in-Tour test earlier this week, but the ever forthright Millar denied it was an excuse for British riders past failings. ""I don't consider the doping aspect to be a factor, it's a cop-out for those happy with being the big fish in a small pond or even a small fish in that pond. ""It is easy to hide behind the excuse that everyone is doping so it's not worth doing but the reality is there hasn't been enough investment or the people with the talent and commitment to make the top level on the road."" Dowsett was keen to stress that Team Sky wear their cleanliness as a badge of honor. ""If there's one thing in our team it's a clean philosophy. It's an even stronger testament to Wiggins' ability that he's done all this clean. ""The Tour de France has some of the most tested athletes on the planet and our team's ethics are unrivaled. Wiggins and Froome have put all these riders to shame both on and off the bike."" So what has Wiggins got which previous British challengers have lacked? And what has gone into transforming him from track speedster to road racing extraordinaire? Millar believes Wiggins' switch to the American Garmin Slipstream team was key point on his path to greatness. ""Only when he went to Garmin did he take steps forward with his road career,"" Millar said of the 32-year-old. Key switch . ""Probably due to a mix of the French teams he was at previously not asking the right questions of him talent wise and Bradley's own contentment with being just a pursuiter who could win short time trials and prologues."" Tactically, Team Sky were impeccable throughout the three-week marathon. Ably assisted by Froome and sprint star Mark Cavendish, Wiggins was consistently in the right place at exactly the right time. ""It's been more about how Sky as a team have been above everyone else,"" added Millar. ""That limits possibilities to challenge when they are riding so fast. ""They've put their general classification riders in the best positions by controlling the race and then Wiggins and Froome have performed better than the other challengers in the time trials."" The support role adopted by Froome and Cavendish is a vital one, and not one to be undermined, as Dowsett testifies to, ""With cycling you have days when you go for the results and you have days when you know it doesn't suit your ability, so you help the team as much as you can. ""Cycling, essentially, is all about pushing the air out of the way. If you have a chain of guys in front of you you barely have to pedal at all. It can keep you fresh -- and keep you out of crashes, too."" After finishing a then British-best fourth in the 1984 Tour, what does Millar think he could have achieved under the tutelage of the meticulous Brailsford and with a ruthless team like Sky at his back? Different times . ""Who knows,"" he replied. ""These are different times with different riders, sometimes I raced too much and usually there were never enough rest periods. It was difficult to prepare well because the thinking used to be one race after another. ""It's like trying to compare eras and champions. The best riders of each era are at the top because of the talent, commitment, intelligence and suffering they cope with."" Regardless of his teammates' performances and the peerless tactical guidance he has received, Wiggins' win in a race many professionals struggle to finish should not be belittled. ""It takes commitment to be a professional cyclist and the Tour de France will push you to your absolute limits,"" insisted Millar. ""If you do well it's a fantastic feeling and it makes the tiredness and mental fatigue justifiable. It's only later you fully realize what's happened when you've had a bit of time to reflect, if you've achieved something that'll go down in history then you can be happy with yourself. ""Then you start planning for the next step, improving, making sure you are staying at that level everyone else is aiming for.""

"(CNN) -- Seven relatives died when their SUV was crushed between two big rigs during a traffic backup in Indiana, leaving the vehicle in a burning, mangled heap. The victims in the Jasper County crash included four children, the Indiana State Police said. Preliminary reports indicate the accident Thursday night occurred when the Jeep stopped behind a tractor-trailer near a work zone. A tractor-trailer behind the Jeep failed to stop, rear-ending it and sending it plowing into the semi in front. The Jeep exploded into flames, which also spread to the two trucks. After firefighters extinguished the flames, they found two bodies in the Jeep. But the car was so severely burned and mangled, fire crews took it to the Keener Township Fire Department to remove the victims. It took them hours to take it apart, and they then discovered five more bodies, authorities said. ""There were a total of three adults and four children found inside the vehicle,"" the Indiana State Police said in a statement. CNN affiliate WLS said they were all family members, but did not specify how they are related to one another. An investigation is under way, but alcohol and narcotics are not believed to be factors, authorities said. Police identified the dead as Indiana residents Lindsey Williams, 27; Arielle Goldman, 3; Yazmin Goldman, 5; Amado Mangual, 49; and Atlanta residents Jamin Osborne, 5; Jasmin Osborne, 7; and Yvette Williams, 35.

"(CNN) -- Four pings and an oil slick. That's what the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has yielded so far. No signs of wreckage, no assurances of exactly where the plane might be. So officials are launching their next option: an underwater vehicle to scan the ocean floor. But even that vehicle -- the Bluefin-21 -- faces plenty of challenges in finding the plane carrying 239 people. How does the underwater vehicle work? The Bluefin-21 is a probe equipped with side-scan sonar, or acoustic technology that creates pictures from the reflections of sound instead of light. The device sends a pulse that produces a three-dimensional map of the seafloor, according to the U.S. Navy. An operator on the surface programs the vehicle, which is owned and operated by Phoenix International, a marine services contractor. ""When it reaches the appropriate depth, it will turn on its sensors,"" said David Kelly, the president and CEO of manufacturer Bluefin Robotics. ""It will then run what's called the lawn mower pattern, which is a series of parallel lines or tracks, where it will go back and forth just like mowing your lawn."" Where will it be launched? The Bluefin-21 will be launched in the most probable area of the pings that were detected by the Australian ship Ocean Shield. From there, it will plunge to a depth of 4,000 to 4,500 meters (2.5 miles) -- roughly 35 meters above the ocean floor, the U.S. Navy said. ""It operates at a height above the bottom optimized for its sensors,"" Kelly said. How fast and how far will the vehicle go? The Bluefin-21's first mission will cover about 40 square kilometers (3.1 miles by 4.9 miles). It'll probably take anywhere from six weeks to two months to scan the entire search area, the U.S. Navy said. That's because the vehicle crawls at the pace of a leisurely stroll, said Sylvia Earle, an oceanographer from National Geographic who was chief scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But the Bluefin-21 does create good images -- so good that they are ""almost a picture of what's there ... but it's imaged with sound instead of with a camera."" What kind of terrain will it have to deal with? The bottom of the search area is not sharply mountainous -- it's more flat and almost rolling, Australian chief search coordinator Angus Houston said. But he said the bottom of the area probably has a lot of silt, which can ""complicate"" the search. Houston cautioned against beliefs that the underwater vehicle will find wreckage. ""It may not,"" he said. ""This will be a slow and painstaking process."" When can we learn what the Bluefin-21 sees? The vehicle has a 24-hour cycle, so it can be deployed only once a day. And no information will be available until the end of each cycle, Houston said. It will take two hours for the Bluefin-21 to get down to the search area. Then it will scour the ocean bed for 16 hours and take another two hours to resurface. After that, it will take another four hours to download and analyze the data collected, Houston said. ""The rate of information flow is certainly going to be a little bit more than a day apart,"" Matthews said. What happens after the pingers die? What happens if and when debris is found? Once the debris field is found, other equipment -- such as remotely operated vehicles -- would be brought in to recover the black boxes, Earle said. ROVs working at depths of 3 miles would require power conveyed down a cable from a ship above, said. ""There are not many pieces of equipment in the world able to do this."" And only a handful of countries have manned submarines capable of descending to such depths -- such as the United States, Russia, Japan, France and China, she said. Why haven't they found any debris yet? It's actually not that surprising, said CNN aviation analyst David Soucie, author of ""Why Planes Crash."" The model used for tracking the debris could be incorrect, Soucie said. He said that was the case when investigators were searching for evidence of Air France Flight 447, which plunged into the southern Atlantic Ocean in 2009, killing all 228 people aboard. ""They spent weeks looking for debris in the wrong area,"" he said. The lack of debris could also mean that the plane did not break apart on impact, but instead sank largely intact, he said. If that was the case, it could complicate the effort to retrieve the black boxes, since they were stored inside the tail of the plane. Investigators would have to dismantle the tail in order to extract them and whatever secrets they may hold. We heard pings last week. Will the towed pinger locators be used again? Probably not. The plane's black boxes were expected to ping for only about 30 days, and Monday marks Day 38 of the search. The towed pinger locator and the Bluefin-21 are hosted by the same Australian ship, and only one device at a time can search underwater, Houston said. And because no new pings had been detected in the past six days, officials have pulled up the pinger locator in order to send down the unmanned vehicle. Houston said it's unlikely the pinger locator will rejoin the search. What do we know about the oil slick? On Sunday night, the Australian ship Ocean Shield found an oil slick about 5.5 kilometers (3.4 miles) downwind from where the pings were detected. A 2-liter sample was collected for analysis. But it could take a few days to transfer that sample to a task force ship, bring it closer to shore, send it by helicopter to Perth, Australia, and then take it to a lab, Royal Australia Navy Capt. Brett Sampson said. Will the mystery of Flight 370 be solved once the data recorders are found? Not necessarily. The voice recorders retain only the last two hours of recordings. And, since officials believe Flight 370 flew almost seven hours beyond the point where something went terribly wrong, crucial data have almost certainly been erased. On the positive side, the depletion of the battery will not wipe out data. Data has been known to survive years in harsh sea water conditions on modern recorders.

"(CNN) -- Kerry-Anne Walsh doesn't mince her words. Australian politics is too ""blokey,"" traditional media is ""dying,"" and the press gallery ""is a beast that feeds on itself."" ""I think it's got me into a lot of trouble,"" the former political journalist says of her straight-talking style. ""But I think it's something that's needed more. There's too much spin in the media. I'm so allergic to spin."" For 25 years Walsh was one of Australia's best known political commentators, working for Sydney newspaper the Sun-Herald, national magazine The Bulletin, and public broadcaster the ABC, among many others. She saw five prime ministers come and go in half a lifetime ""living and breathing"" the Canberra press gallery. Then Julia Gillard, Australia's first female prime minister, came to power and Walsh got so hacked off she left and wrote a book about it. It wasn't Gillard, as much as her treatment by the media that infuriated Walsh. ""She was mercilessly and relentlessly lampooned for her hair, clothes, accent, her arse, even the way she walks and talks,"" she says in book ""The Stalking of Julia Gillard."" Screen star . Now the controversial account -- which became one of the country's top-selling nonfiction books and provoked a backlash from some former colleagues -- is set to hit our screens, with Golden Globe-winning actor and fellow Aussie Rachel Griffiths playing Gillard. Walsh is pleased with the decision to cast Griffith, perhaps best known internationally for her role in HBO series ""Six Feet Under,"" saying both women possess ""the same calm demeanor."" Producer Richard Keddie -- the man behind other Labor bio-dramas ""Hawke"" and ""Curtin"" -- will oversee the project, expected to be released in 2015. Though it's still undecided if it will take the form of a TV drama or feature film. Power play . Gillard came to power in 2010, replacing fellow Labor leader Kevin Rudd. Three years later, the party voted Rudd back in. ""The book is a fairly 'in-your-face' account of Gillard's leadership,"" says Walsh. ""It focuses on how she was undermined by Rudd's forces and the role the media played in it."" Why did she feel compelled to write it? ""Because I got angry. Not just because of what was happening to her, but because I had given a quarter of a century of my life to trying to report as accurately and fairly as I could, and I was bloody appalled by the mind-set about her leadership,"" says Walsh, who left the press gallery in 2009. ""There were very few people in the media who were prepared to divert from the pack and scrutinize in an objective fashion -- which as journalists is what we've been told to do on a daily basis."" Did the fact Gillard was a woman affect how she was portrayed by the media? ""It had something to do with it,"" says Walsh, speaking by phone from her home in Canberra, not far from the country's Parliament House. ""I do believe we in Australia have a deeply ingrained... how do I say this? We're just not ready for women in positions of power."" Young ambition . Walsh grew up in Sydney, one of six children in an Irish-Catholic home, with a father who was involved in the Democratic Labor Party throughout the 1960s. Politics had always been a topic around the dinner table. But when Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was dramatically dismissed by the Governor-General in 1975 -- the only time in Australia's history this had ever happened -- it became a passion. ""You'd have to have had your head under a rock not to be interested one way or another,"" says Walsh, who dreamed of being a journalist for as long as she can remember. ""I went for a cadetship at what was then the Daily Mirror. And I was told by this bloke who was blowing cigarette smoke all over me that 'We don't take convent girls,' because I had come from a school run by nuns,'"" she said. After that, Walsh says she ""just sort of winged my through,"" working as a copywriter, then for a trade union paper, before landing her first job at the Daily Telegraph, and becoming a familiar face in the Canberra press gallery. Life's work . ""Parliament house is a little city in itself, with around 3,000 people working there,"" said Walsh. ""It's a wild card on any given day -- you never know how politicians are going to be reacting to certain policies or events. So you have to be basically on-call 24/7. It becomes your life. Even now I can't get out of the habit of staying up until all the current affairs shows are done and making sure you're fully across everything."" Today, the mother of a 23-year-old son, who describes her age as ""not yet 60,"" still contributes the odd political commentary, volunteers with aboriginal-support groups, and is ""plotting her next book."" It's perhaps fitting that her two dogs are called Les and Darcy -- after 19th century Australian boxer Les Darcy. She laughs when I point out the similarities with her own fighting words. ""I know the book did hit a lot of nerves,"" she says. ""But I do hope it contributes to discussion about the way politicians and the media are responsible to the public. If it's done that, then well and good. I'll be bloody pleased.""","Meet Kerry-Anne Walsh, the straight-talking Aussie political journalist .

"(CNN) -- Faster than you can catch the red-eye from New York to London, the world's airlines have to keep evolving in order to stay resilient in the global world of commercial aviation. With 8 million passengers taking a plane each day, the 3 billion journeys made last year are more than just a flight for many. They are the hopes and dreams of deals to be done, families to be reunited and ambitions to be realized. The first commercial flight 100 years ago was a 23-minute journey in a flying boat across Tampa Bay, Florida in 1914. The Mayor of St. Petersburg, Florida, at that time paid $400 -- about $9,000 today -- to become the world's first paying passenger. Since the birth of commercial aviation the airline industry has been characterized by the concept of risk versus reward, with some of the best-known names failing, many merging and consolidating along the way. Pan American World Airways was one of the first to blaze a trail across the Atlantic with its spacious cabins, ladies-only powder rooms and modest overhead lights. But even for Pan Am it wasn't enough to keep the company financially astute. ""These names have gone, the Pan Ams and the British Caledonian and others, but of course their businesses went into other businesses, and that tells us that consolidation is the way forward in this industry,"" Tony Tyler, CEO of International Air Transport Association (IATA), told CNN's Richard Quest at the group's 70th AGM in Doha, Qatar. The industry has suffered as much turbulence in the pocket as it has in the air, and American Airlines is another example of risk versus reward. After its recent bankruptcy, it was the last major U.S. carrier to merge, with U.S. Airways. There's no better example of risk and reward than the Boeing 747, the Jumbo Jet. The world's first wide-bodied, double decker plane, it was built by Boeing in the 1960s, which literally bet the company on the plane's success. According to Tyler, a key to success in the future is sticking to a global mindset. ""The point is this is a global industry, it's become global over the last 100 years,"" he told Quest. ""We are the industry that makes global possible and what that means is that everyone in it needs to understand they are part of a global network. They're part of a global system and they need to think globally in everything they do."" While today's airplanes are a century away from that flying boat that crossed Tampa Bay, there's no doubt that the risk and reward still remain just as high as they did 100 years ago.

"Washington (CNN) -- The nation's first black president could be in danger of becoming a ""one-termer"" if he can't convince enough white voters that he deserves another four years in the Oval Office. For weeks, he's hovered around 40% of white voter support - a level that Democratic presidential candidates have struggled with in the recent past and one that analysts believe Barack Obama must maintain in order to win. At the same time, he has to encourage minority voters to go to the polls and capture 80% of their support. Do the math: CNN racial bloc voting calculator . ""Obama in 08 became the first presidential candidate ever to lose whites by double digits and win. And he could lose them by even more this time and still win. But he can't fall through the floor with them, and the polling shows him ... right at the water line of 40 percent that he'll need, maybe just below sometimes just above,"" said Ron Brownstein, the National Journal editorial director and CNN senior political analyst. ""The big qualification: he's running better among working class whites in the upper Midwest battlegrounds of Iowa, Wisconsin and Ohio than anywhere else and that is his last line of defense in this very close election,"" he said. With 59% support among whites, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney is hitting record numbers among that group. He is approaching a margin of support last seen by Republican Ronald Reagan in his 1984 re-election. Yet, support for Romney among non-white voters has hovered between 18-20%, according to national Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll data. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Republican nominee John McCain got roughly 55% of the white vote and 20% of the non-white vote. ""This is a long-term demographic problem,"" John Avlon, a CNN contributor, said. ""We don't want to see our politics divided by race going into the future. That is not healthy or sustainable for a nation as large and diverse as we are and this election is shaping up along these fault lines."" The racial trends in this year's election are part of a complicated calculus in which a greater number of white Republican voters could offset possibly lower turnout among the Democratic base of minorities and young voters. Moreover, an ongoing fight in battleground states over voter identification laws, which some opponents say are efforts to disenfranchise minority voters in a close election and proponents say are needed to prevent fraud, is also a factor. The result is a deeply partisan and polarized election that could hinge — in part — on some uncomfortable racial math. ""Part of the reason we're thinking about this is the dynamic of this being a black president,"" said Mark Anthony Neal, a cultural and Black studies professor at Duke University. Is Obama taking black vote for granted? Neither the Obama and Romney campaigns commented on the racial differences in the polling figures. However, both campaigns have shown that they are aware that the nuances of race factor into potential wins. Romney's comments during a May fundraiser that ""it would be helpful to be Latino"" because were he ""born of Mexican parents, I'd have a better shot of winning this,"" went over poorly with some Latinos—a voting block the campaign is trying to make inroads with through Spanish language advertisements and dispatching bilingual surrogates. During recent comments to the Des Moines Register editorial board, Obama said: ""I will just be very blunt. Should I win a second term, a big reason I will win a second term is because the Republican nominee and the Republican Party have so alienated the fastest-growing demographic group in the country, the Latino community."" Obama made history when he won the 2008 presidential election — a feat he accomplished in part with 43% of the white vote. It was the same percentage former President Bill Clinton netted in 1996. But Democrats have struggled for the past decade to hold on to white voters during presidential elections, Brownstein said. In 2004, Sen. John Kerry lost his presidential run after getting only 41% of that group. In the 2000 election, Vice President Al Gore lost with 42% of the white vote, 90% of the black vote and 35% of the Latino vote. ""Democrats have struggled for several decades to maintain any measurable level of support among whites, especially non-college whites,"" Brownstein said. ""No Democratic nominee has won a majority of whites since 1964. And it's been especially hard for Democrats to hold onto whites after they have had unified control of Washington, which suggests they are having trouble convincing whites to buy into their vision of activist government."" And Republicans have struggled to woo minority voters. In 2004, for example President George W. Bush won re-election with 30% of the minority male and 24% of the minority female vote. Exit polls from the 2000 election showed that Bush received only 9% of the black vote and 35 percent of the Latino vote. The number of minority voters has increased since those elections. Over the next several generations, the wave of minority voters -- who, according to U.S. Census figures, now represent more than half of the nation's population born in the past year -- will become more of a power base in such GOP strongholds as Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia. That hold will extend all the way to California, experts say. GOP problem: 'Their voters are white, aging and dying off' But for now, the population remains majority white and turnout rates are traditionally lower among minorities—both factors that could prove problematic for Obama. ""What we're beginning to see is the Republicans are becoming increasingly white and Democrats are increasingly losing white people. They're maintaining the minorities, but losing whites ...,"" CNN contributor LZ Granderson told the network. ""It's the message. Something they're doing as a party that is not appealing to the white voter. And so it isn't just about President Obama. It's about the platform."" Granderson: Both parties have a huge race problem . Political experts attribute part of Obama's struggles with some white voters to disappointment in his handling of the economy. Discomfort over his shift on such social issues as support for gays serving openly in the military and his administration's federal mandate requiring religious institutions to offer employees insurance coverage for contraception may keep some socially conservative white voters from casting ballots for Obama, political experts say. But for some voters, a subtle form of racism may also be at play, Neal said. ""If we were in a post-race society, the measurement is not the election of Obama but the re-election of President Obama. He still had to perform and he has been held on a short leash in that context,"" Neal said making the analogy that black professional sports coaches and managers are similarly given less room to stumble than their white counterparts. ""Many voters including black voters don't feel Obama performed exceptionally (on the economy),"" Neal said. ""So much of what we've seen in terms of Romney support is a fundamental distrust of Obama because he's not giving the goods. That argument is easier to be made because he's black. ... It's not so much they are voting for Romney because he's white but the economy protects them. They don't have to feel guilty because of the economy. The economy lets them off the hook."" Whatever the reasons for the gap, Obama will have to work overtime to maintain numbers of white voters who say they will vote for him while convincing minority voters to turn out to vote, said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University. ""To be more comfortable he should be going above 40 percent (with white voters),"" Gillespie said. ""He's focusing on women, the majority of whom are going to be white, by talking about issues of reproductive health and contraception. He's going for the white youth vote by talking about student loans."" Both campaigns realize that all of their careful math hinges on getting out the vote. ""They should have a good sense of where their voters are and who their voters are. They should have spoken to them by phone,"" Gillespie said. ""And they should have a plan in place to ask them to vote between now and Election Day.""","40% of white voters say they'll vote for President Obama--the minimum threshold he needs to win .
For at least a decade, Democrats have had lower numbers with white voters in presidential elections .
Political experts attribute lower white support to party identification trends, economy, social policy, race .
Obama must hold the line with white voters; get high minority turnout to win."
"(CNN) -- A wildfire that destroyed at least 36 homes and one business in Southern California in May was set intentionally, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department announced Wednesday. A minor whose name has not been released has been identified as the person accused of setting what authorities have coined the Cocos Fire. Three people were injured in the blaze, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The Cocos Fire scorched almost 2,000 acres of land before a crew of more than 500 firefighters was able to contain it eight days after it started. The fire was one of dozens that erupted in the region as California battled severe drought conditions and temperatures reached record highs. Investigators have not linked the suspect in the Cocos Fire to any of the other fires, according to the Sheriff's Department. The case has been forwarded to the district attorney's office. In all, 176,000 evacuation notices were sent out throughout San Diego County in response to the wave of wildfires. Fire season in Southern California typically starts late in the summer and extends into fall. But San Diego County Supervisor Dianne Jacob said in May that the area now contends with a ""year-round fire risk.""

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Clarence Thomas has an abundance of two things that are often in short supply whenever Americans talk about race: courage and common sense. The only African-American on the Supreme Court displayed both this week in speaking to a small gathering of students and faculty at Palm Beach Atlantic University, a nondenominational Christian school in Florida. In a series of provocative and insightful comments about race that were first reported by Yahoo! News and confirmed by several people who attended the talk and heard the remarks firsthand, Thomas dropped a few bombshells. This got people's attention because -- nearly 25 years after his bitter confirmation battle -- Thomas remains a lightning rod for controversy, and because he rarely speaks while on the bench. Apparently, he has been saving the best stuff for the public remarks that he delivers in more casual settings. Like this one: . ""My sadness is that we are probably today more race and difference-conscious than I was in the 1960s when I went to school,"" Thomas told the audience. ""To my knowledge, I was the first black kid in Savannah, Georgia, to go to a white (Catholic) school. Rarely did the issue of race come up."" He went on to note that, these days, many Americans talk about race a lot and have a hair trigger on the subject. ""Now, name a day (race) doesn't come up,"" Thomas said. ""Differences in race, differences in sex, somebody doesn't look at you right, somebody says something. Everybody is sensitive."" The sensitive include Samuel L. Jackson. In a cringe-inducing confrontation, Jackson scolded an entertainment reporter at a Los Angeles television station after the journalist, in asking about a Super Bowl commercial, appeared to confuse Jackson for another African-American actor -- Laurence Fishburne. Both actors had appeared in Super Bowl commercials, and the reporter seemed to get them mixed up. ""You're as crazy as the people on Twitter. I'm not Laurence Fishburne!"" Jackson said during a live TV interview with KTLA's Sam Rubin. ""We don't all look alike. We may be all black and famous, but we all don't look alike. You're busted."" Rubin immediately apologized for the mistake, but Jackson kept razzing him. It was overkill. ""I'm the other guy,"" the actor said. ""There's more than one black guy doing a commercial. I'm the 'What's in your wallet?' black guy. He's the car black guy. Morgan Freeman is the other credit card black guy. You only hear his voice, though, so you probably won't confuse him with Laurence Fishburne."" It seemed to be all in good fun, but it was still hard to watch. Rubin made a mistake. But it looked like Jackson was the one with the problem. Rubin did have some defenders. They include CNN's Don Lemon, who -- after a contentious exchange between guests on a show he was hosting -- seemed to agree with Thomas that ""people are really sensitive when it comes to race."" Finally, Thomas took aim at a group that often gets a pass for its mistreatment of minorities that it claims to be helping. ""The worst I have been treated was by northern liberal elites,"" he said. ""The absolute worst I have ever been treated, the worst things that have been done to me, the worst things that have been said about me, are by northern liberal elites, not by the people of Savannah, Georgia."" Only Thomas can speak to how he has been treated in his life, and who treated him worse. That is a personal matter. As one of the most conservative members of the High Court, he obviously has little respect for liberals. And the feeling is entirely mutual. And yet, we can expect Thomas' observation about ""northern liberal elites"" to resonate with many other African-Americans and Latinos who have been criticized, attacked, or disparaged by this bunch for veering off the script of how minorities are supposed to think, speak and behave. Those minorities are often treated as defective in some way and certainly not representative of their respective communities. They're an aberration, an anomaly, a mistake. Make no mistake. The friction here isn't about politics. It's about something more primal: control. Liberals wanted to give people like Clarence Thomas every right except, it turns out, the right to think for themselves. If you forget that, you'll be labeled a ""sellout,"" a ""traitor,"" a ""right wingnut"" or worse. Most Americans probably look back on Thomas' confirmation hearings in the fall of 1991, and think that what made them so messy were those unseemly accusations of sexual harassment by Anita Hill. That was a sideshow. The real reason for the tension in those hearings was that Thomas represents something liberals can't stand: a black conservative. Those on the left see conservatives of color as a kind of sociological experiment gone bad -- these are people who are ungrateful for the many opportunities they were provided by the liberal establishment which, in return, asked for only three things: undying loyalty, constant agreement, and lifelong subservience. Thomas doesn't play that game. He never has. And that's why he is always at the center of the storm. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Clarence Thomas said America may be too sensitive about race today .
Ruben Navarrette says Thomas displays courage and common sense .
He says the justice is right in saying Northern liberal elites are less tolerant of differing views .

"(CNN) -- Two snowy owls injured by the downdraft of jets taking off in Boston have been released in a safer place where the likes of saltmarsh sparrows and piping plovers flutter amid marshes, bogs and beach dunes. The pair were released Monday morning at Parker River National Wildlife Refuge on Plum Island in northeastern Massachusetts, after nearly eight weeks of treatment and rehabilitation, said Dr. Flo Tseng, director of the wildlife clinic where the birds were treated. The yellow-eyed, white birds were taken in March to the Tufts Wildlife Clinic in North Grafton, where one was treated for soft-tissue wounds and the other had lifesaving surgery for a broken wing, said Tseng. The owls were rescued by Norman Smith, director of the Massachusetts Audubon Society's Blue Hills Trailside Museum, after they were injured at Boston Logan International Airport. The owls have been a concern for decades at the airport, where authorities use nets to catch the birds before relocating them, Smith told CNN in December. A greater number of owls have been reported at the airport this year, Tseng said. Logan officials have captured and released more than 100 snowy owls this winter, as opposed to just 10 owls last year, she said. The influx is possibly due to an abundance of prey. Logan Airport's likeness to the tundra makes it a favorable place for the birds to land, but a dangerous place to fly, Tseng said. Tufts Wildlife Clinic, part of the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University, has treated six snowy owls this year. The clinic has a 100-foot flight pen that's used for conditioning, a key part in the owl's recovery, she said. ""We go in there and we bug them. We walk down to the end where they're perched and they'll fly down to the other end. So we end up exercising them,"" Tseng said. Although snowy owls are not an endangered species, their numbers are declining and nobody knows the actual population of these birds, said Smith. Tseng said the rise and fall in the number of owls they treat each year varies. ""We try not to get attached because they're wild animals and many wild animals don't make it. It's really hard for them in captivity,"" she said. Tseng said she believes these two owls are the last the clinic will see this season, because most have already migrated back toward the Canadian Arctic. ""They'll probably spend a little bit more time hanging around Plum Island, building up strength before going up north."" CNN's Allie Malloy contributed to this report.","Pair of snowy owls released to wild after rehab at clinic .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A construction worker found what appears to be a World War II-era bomb Thursday afternoon at a work site on Hong Kong Island, prompting evacuations in the area, police told CNN. The suspected bomb was found upright in the ground as workers dug at a construction site for a hotel, the police told CNN. Initial police analysis suggested it was American ordnance, designated US Navy ANM 66. People within 500 meters of the site were told to leave by 8 p.m. (7 a.m. ET), the Chinese news agency Xinhua reported, citing police. The evacuation area included the neighboring Cosmopolitan Hotel. Police didn't immediately know how many people would be evacuated, police spokesperson Florence Ma told CNN. A team of at least six bomb disposal officers in protective clothing was seen at the site. A police spokesperson said that they would not attempt a controlled detonation on site. Neither the condition of the casing nor the integrity of the device could not immediately be confirmed. The scene was calm Thursday night. Firetrucks, ambulances and roughly two dozen police officers were there, but traffic was flowing on the nearby main road, and there appeared to be no onlookers, save for a small group of reporters. Traffic was stopped on roads leading to the site, resulting in a line of several waiting buses. Police gave passengers the option to alight but most waited for the cordon to be lifted. Such a discovery isn't unheard of, and unexploded bombs from World War II raids have been found in Hong Kong hillsides and construction sites, the police spokesman said. Bombs from that era also have been found in Europe. Last month, a bulldozer struck what authorities believed was a World War II-era bomb in the western German town of Euskirchen, causing a blast that killed the bulldozer driver, injured a number of other people and damaged homes, police said.","NEW: Apparent bomb believed to date from World War II, Hong Kong police say .

"(CNN) -- When Ashton Kutcher posed for a photo with a high school student at a University of Iowa football game on September 11, it was ""unintentional and accidental,"" not a violation of college athletic recruiting rules, the NCAA decided Monday. The NCAA launched an investigation that could have penalized the sports teams at Kutcher's former college after the high school student posted a message on Twitter, along with a photo. ""What a better way to celebrate a birthday than to meet a cool guy like Ashton?"" Marcus Paige tweeted soon after meeting Kutcher and his wife, actress Demi Moore. ""Go Hawks!"" Kutcher said in his own tweet, sent the same day from Iowa's Kinnick Stadium during the Iowa-Iowa State game. Kutcher, who studied at Iowa before dropping out to work as a model, was in a stadium skybox suite with his wife when two highly sought basketball prospects, including Paige, were brought there during halftime. The NCAA bans boosters, such as Kutcher, from meeting with potential recruits because of the influence they could have on a student's choice of schools, school spokesman Steve Roe said. ""Casual greetings are allowed,"" Roe said. ""That's what this was. It was not previously arranged."" The university responded to ""Letters of Inquiry"" from the NCAA concerning ""activities involving its football program and its men's basketball program,"" University of Iowa Athletic Director Gary Barta said. The NCAA informed Iowa's athletics department Monday afternoon that it accepted the school's response. ""As part of that decision, the NCAA has fully cleared the recruits involved, and has determined the UI's actions to be of a 'secondary' nature in terms of violation of NCAA policy,"" the university said in a written statement Monday. Kutcher, who is on a trip to Russia, did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment.

"Laurel, Maryland (CNN) -- On a late afternoon in early June, undercover police officers circled a one-story highway motel north of Washington. Inside was a 12-year-old girl who told her mother she was being forced to work as a prostitute. According to her mother, the girl had started running away from home earlier this year. She found out her daughter was in the sex trade when she saw her in an adult online classified ad. The girl was advertising herself as a 24-year-old with a bogus name. The next time she ran away, her mother reported her missing. Read the police press release . According to police and anti-trafficking advocates, the internet has now become the preferred way to sell women for sex. It's fast and convenient for the pimps and relatively safe for the men who pay for sex. Instead of trolling the streets, they can now look through hundreds of girls from the safety of their homes or hotels. This time, the girl was lucky. She called home, and the call was traced to a Knight's Inn in Laurel, Maryland, where police were quickly on the scene. They rescued the girl and arrested a 42-year-old man and charged him with human trafficking. Of all the sites that offer ""adult services,"" Craigslist is one of the most popular. The online classified ad site is used regularly by about 50 million Americans for everything from buying used lawn furniture to finding a job or a roommate. It's also used to sell sex, making Craigslist a prime target of a nationwide campaign against internet prostitution. ""Most of the young women we've worked with who have been exploited online talk about Craigslist,"" said Andrea Powell of the anti-trafficking group The FAIR Fund. ""Craigslist is like the Wal-Mart of online sex trafficking right now in this country."" According to police who investigated the case of the missing 12-year-old, she had previously advertised on Craigslist under a false name and age. Craigslist declined to provide copies of the ad, citing privacy concerns. Craigslist founder Craig Newmark defended his site, saying it is doing more than any other site that hosts adult ads to help filter out underage prostitutes and report them to police. In 2008, under pressure from state prosecutors, the website raised the fees for posting adult services ads. In 2009, it started donating portions of the money generated by adult ads to charity. Craigslist also began to manually screen all ads and said it would refer any suspected underage girls to law enforcement. That's not good enough for anti-trafficking activists. For all its reforms, they say Craigslist still has no way of knowing whether the females being sold are women or girls and is doing too little to help police identify and rescue children who are being sold for sex. A CNN investigation of Craigslist's ""adult services"" section, which replaced ""erotic services ads"" two years ago, counted more than 7,000 ads in a single day. Many offered thinly veiled ""services"" for anything from $50 for a half hour to $400 an hour. Many of the ads had photographs attached, and in many of those it was difficult to tell whether the female was an adult or a minor. Ads with words suggestive of youth, like ""young"" and ""fresh,"" received a flood of responses from men who clearly expected sex in exchange for money. One 20-year-old said it's the easiest and cheapest way to get customers. A 20-year-old identified only as ""Jessica"" works out of low-rent hotels on Washington's busy Interstate 95 corridor. She posts ads mid-morning for $10 and says she earns up to $250 from each man who answers and shows up. She told CNN her ""man"" -- her pimp -- was good to her, but that the vast majority of the females who post ads are run by pimps who force them to have sex with as many as a dozen men a day. She said many of the prostitutes give everything they earn directly to the pimps. If they don't, they're beaten. ""Girls are called 'yes bitches' and 'no bitches.' Yes bitches are what the pimps want,"" Jessica said after applying makeup to cover bruising on her face. ""My advice is if you're doing this to be a yes bitch. Otherwise, you're going to have a very hard time."" Just how many of the ads include children is extremely difficult to establish, but many of the photos that accompany the ads on Craigslist are questionable. A classified posted alongside Jessica's ad in the Washington market showed an African-American woman in her underwear offering herself for $250 an hour. Like dozens of other pictures posted the same week, her face appeared very young. According to internet research firm the AIM Group, Craigslist this year is expected to earn a third of its revenue -- more than $36 million -- from its adult services section alone. AIM Group's summary report on Craigslist . Craigslist says any increased revenue is partly because it was required to charge more for adult ads under a 2008 agreement with government officials intended to curb the volume of online adult ads. But the amount it is earning has opened the website up to charges that it's profiting from the exploitation of women. According to its own rules, Craigslist requires anyone using its adult services section to immediately report any suspicious ads to a national tip-line run by the Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The head of Washington's Metropolitan Police anti-prostitution unit said Craigslist ""never"" reports suspicious ads to his department. ""It does bother us from a law enforcement perspective, because the problem is so rampant that you know to get a handle on it we need all the assistance we can get,"" Metropolitan police inspector Brian Bray said. ""If they're notifying, I'm not sure if they're notifying the right people, because we're not getting a call."" Craigslist spokeswoman Susan MacTavish told CNN in an e-mail that of all the websites that offer adult services ads, Craigslist is the leader in pushing users to report any suspected violation. She said the site cooperates fully with law enforcement, and that fewer than one ad in 10,000 meets the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's guidelines for anti-trafficking action. MacTavish also noted that Craigslist requires anyone posting an ad to give the website a phone number, which is verified as being real. She said that because Craigslist follows the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's guidelines, the percentage of ads in its adult services section that are in fact children is ""effectively zero."" The head of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said his group has recently started to get referrals from Craigslist, but that it has no direct say in how Craigslist determines what ads are worth reporting. ""We are not a part of their initial screening and review process, and don't see exactly what their screeners see or know how they make their determinations as to what is actionable and reportable,"" director Ernie Allen wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""We are now getting reports from them regarding suspected violations and that is a good thing. The key question is -- are they doing enough?"" To another national advocacy group, the Rebecca Project, there's only one answer to Craigslist's adult services dilemma: Shut it down. The Rebecca Project has published open letters to Newmark from a former underage prostitute who says her pimp forced her to sell her body and used Craigslist to drum up customers. ""We hear this story every single day of girls who are being bought and sold, American girls who are being bought and sold through the internet,"" said Malika Saada Saar, executive director of the Rebecca Project. Read Saada Saar's commentary on CNN.com . She believes many Americans are either unaware of just how many girls are being sold on sites like Craigslist or simply chose to ignore the problem. ""I think we have an easier time looking at these girls when they are in India or Thailand and being thoughtful or supportive of those girls,"" Sadaa Saar said. ""But when those girls come from Southeast D.C., or Toledo, Ohio, or Atlanta, Georgia, we are challenged at being able to see them as victims. It's much easier to call them bad girls or girls acting out, as opposed to recognizing these are girls who are vulnerable, who are being raped and exploited.""","Popular online ad site Craigslist is a target of anti-prostitution activists .

"(CNN) -- If you've booked travel online, you may have been there. Nancy Cutter, a travel agent in Charlotte, North Carolina, discusses vacation options with a client. Online travel sites flooded with overwhelming options, all claiming the best deals. Extra fees nestled into the fine print amid blaring advertisements. Pounding 16 digits into the telephone after you've booked the wrong flight before finally getting a human voice. A few weeks ago, Darin Kaplan, a tech-savvy 27-year-old California restaurant manager, clicked his mouse hundreds of times, surfing the vast choices offered by online travel booking Web sites like Expedia.com and Orbitz.com to plan his 28th birthday cruise to Mexico before he gave up in frustration. ""It's a cut-and-paste experience when you're booking online. None of these sites are going to tell me what I can do with different options,"" said Kaplan, who uses the Internet for many purchases, including his basketball shorts and music tickets. ""Travel agents know what they are talking about. It's more comforting to hand my money to someone who has the knowledge and experience."" Some travelers like Kaplan are finding themselves defecting from travel booking sites like Travelocity.com or airline sites like Delta.com. They are going back the travel agent, an industry that many industry experts once thought to be passé with the advent of online booking. Fewer travelers are enjoying using the Web to plan and buy trips, according to a study last week by Forrester Research, a market research company. About 46 percent of U.S. leisure travelers enjoyed using the Internet to book travel this year, down from 53 percent in 2007. Difficult site navigation and presentation on travel company sites and hotel and airline sites are causing a growing number of travelers to shift away from the Web and consider using alternative methods of booking travel. ""People are saying 'I don't understand my options, and I would like to talk to someone who can do all the searching and tell me what's available,' "" said Henry Hartevelt, the analyst who wrote the Forrester study. ""Major travel agencies have absolutely failed in their responsibility to innovate and think of creative new ways to help their customers shop."" In the brick-and-mortar travel agent model, a trained agent meets with the traveler in person or establishes a relationship over the phone. For a fee, they discuss the travel options they have researched. These travel agencies began losing their monopoly on the industry during the late 1990s, when airlines began to sell tickets online and travel giants like Expedia.com exploded onto the scene, quickly gobbling market share by introducing the quick, do-it- yourself model. In 1995, there were 37,000 brick-and-mortar travel agencies, according to the American Society of Travel Agents. Now, only 18,000 exist after many merged or folded. ""What the Internet has done is given us a nation that knows the price of everything and the value of nothing,"" said Bill Maloney, CEO of the American Society of Travel Agents. ""How do you know if a hotel is actually a good value or if it's overpriced? You have these online generalists and these individual specialists."" Travel agent Nancy Cutter of Court Travel Ltd. in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a half-dozen other agencies across the country say they have experienced a surge in returning clients, who said travel Web sites were confusing and unhelpful. In several instances, brick-and-mortar agents say they were able to offer deals at the same price as, and even undercut, the travel agent models, dispelling the belief that the cheapest rate is online. Travel agents have deals with suppliers that can sometimes enable them to offer lower prices than on the Web. They also have time to cancel tickets for free, compared with some non-refundable tickets sold on the Web. Expedia.com said it recently waived the fee for travelers changing certain flights. ""Just because you can go out and buy Turbo Tax doesn't mean it's the best answer for everyone,"" Cutter said. ""Some people will still go to an accountant. Booking travel can get complicated, and it's just not as easy as it looks."" Travel agents don't discount the value of online travel agencies, which can be useful for booking simple, short trips, but they say complex itineraries require more expertise from a professional. Many online travel companies agree that an agent may be valuable in planning a detailed honeymoon that includes a tour of vineyards in France or a family excursion to top snorkeling and kangaroo-watching destinations in Australia. ""If you're the type of traveler who needs hand-holding up front, then sure, a travel agent would be great, but you can usually find that same information on the Web,"" said Brian Ek, a spokesman for Priceline.com, a travel company famous for letting bidders set their own price. He said the agents available by phone at his company can help facilitate a sale and customize cruises for travelers. Online travel companies say they have made functionality improvements on their sites in recent years. For example, Expedia.com, the world's largest online travel agency, offers a tool that can let customers compare seats on an airplane, with ratings on how comfortable a seat is and how much leg room is available. They also have hotel reviews and even Web tours of rooms to help travelers decide. And, research shows that online travel model is poised to grow. Even in a recession, when companies and individuals are scaling back on travel, Expedia.com saw a 22 percent air transaction growth rate in the last quarter. But Susan D. Tanzman of Martin's Travel and Tours in California, who has worked as an agent for 35 years, points out that agents follow up with travelers before and after the trip. If the traveler needs help, the agency can offer assistance. They often work 24 hours a day. JoAnne Kochneff, owner of midsize agency Travel by Gagnon in Michigan, said agents can give the personal attention a site cannot. Kochneff's office provides a homey feel, with agents offering freshly baked cookies for clients who stop by to chat about their trips. ""They have personal experience traveling in the area, so they can give you a personal recommendation,"" said Frances Mosser, 67, of Kentucky, on her reason why she switched to the travel agent model this summer. Mosser and her husband booked a trip to St. Melo in France with a travel agent. The agent helped them devise a way to reduce travel time by taking Ryan Air between countries. ""I don't think we could have planned the trip without her,"" Mosser said.","Study finds 46 percent of travelers enjoyed using Web to book travel this year .

"(CNN) -- If you're going to pursue an elusive killer, you sometimes have to get creative. A pioneering study into malaria transmission in Kenya, using data gleaned from the cell phones of nearly 15 million people, has given scientists new clues into how the deadly disease spreads. By tracking the population's movement over a year using cell phone data and comparing it with detailed information on malaria infection rates across the country, the study reveals how human travel contributes to the disease's spread. The study, led by researchers at Harvard School of Public Health and seven other institutions, could inform how governments -- particularly in sub-Saharan Africa -- act in future to control the disease's spread. Malaria deaths are concentrated in that part of the continent. Published in the journal Science on Thursday, the study, ""Quantifying the impact of human mobility on malaria,"" gives key insights into a disease that kills a child a minute in Africa, according to the World Health Organization. ""This is the first time that such a massive amount of cell phone data -- from millions of individuals over the course of a year -- has been used, together with detailed infectious disease data, to measure human mobility and understand how a disease is spreading,"" said senior author Caroline Buckee, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard. Since the disease is passed on to humans by mosquitoes that carry the malaria parasite, the movement of infected people into areas of lower incidence is an important factor. Between June 2008 and June 2009, lead author Amy Wesolowski, a Carnegie-Mellon doctoral student, and her team mapped every call or text made by 14,816,521 Kenyan mobile phone subscribers to one of 11,920 cell towers in 692 different settlements. This allowed them to follow the destination and duration of each trip made from the cell phone user's primary place of residence. Using detailed data from a malaria prevalence map for 2009, drawn up by the Kenya Medical Research Institute and the Malaria Atlas Project, the researchers determined that malaria largely emanates from western Kenya's Lake Victoria region and spreads east, chiefly toward the capital, Nairobi. The team ""found that a surprisingly large fraction of 'imported' infections â€” that is, infections that are carried by people moving from one place to another â€” wind up in Nairobi, with infected residents returning there after journeys to spots such as Lake Victoria or the coast,"" the news release says. This may lead to an increased risk of local transmission within Nairobi and its surrounding areas, despite the lower number of mosquitoes, or ""malaria vectors,"" in urban areas. The research suggests that efforts to control malaria could benefit from a focus on ""source"" areas where incidence is high, rather than on areas where fewer people are infected. Human travel patterns mean the parasite is likely repeatedly to be carried back to areas where it has been almost eliminated. The study advises that on a very local scale, ""hot spots of transmission can be targeted by indoor residual spraying, vector habitat removal, insecticides, drug administration, and bed-net use."" But attempts to control transmission by targeting human travel between regions ""will be completely different from those that concentrate on local transmission hot spots, focusing on communicating risks to travelers to alter their behaviors, restricting travel patterns, and/or conducting routine surveillance in high-risk areas."" This could mean encouraging people from areas of high prevalence to use insecticide-treated bed nets when traveling to areas of lower malaria incidence to avoid bringing the parasite with them. It also advises visitors to areas such as Lake Victoria to take greater care not to become infected before their return home. Wesolowski acknowledges certain limitations such as following only cell phone users in areas where there are cell towers and inability to track people's cross-border movements. However, the importance of such research into one of the world's largest preventable causes of death should not be underestimated. There were about 216 million cases of malaria worldwide in 2010 and about 655,000 deaths from the disease that year, according to the World Health Organization. Understanding and preventing the disease's spread from areas of high incidence is a key weapon in the fight against malaria. The innovative research could also point the way for other studies into infectious diseases, helped by ever growing rates of cell phone usage worldwide, and particularly in the developing world. ""As mobile phone data sets become increasingly available and representative of entire populations, we anticipate that studies like the one we present here will become common for understanding a range of different infectious diseases, as well as for gaining greater insight into human behavior on a population level,"" the study's authors say. The WHO's 2011 world malaria report shows that concerted efforts to tackle the disease can make a difference, with death rates down by more than 25% globally since 2000. CNN's Faith Karimi contributed to this report.","Researchers use cell phone data to track movement of about 15 million people .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court will take another look at government regulation of air pollution in a high-stakes environmental and economic fight pitting the Obama administration against a coalition of states and utilities. The justices announced Tuesday they had accepted six separate appeals for review, which will be consolidated into an hour of oral arguments scheduled for early next year. A ruling is expected by June. At issue is whether the federal Environmental Protection Agency can tighten emission standards for stationary greenhouse gas sources, such as power plants, in what the government says is an effort to stem the effects of global warming. The high court in 2007 affirmed the conclusions by much of the scientific community that greenhouse gases are an air pollutant, but that case dealt with emissions from motor vehicles. A range of business groups say the agency then improperly extended its regulatory authority. Texas was among the states whose cases were accepted. Climate change to drive annual temps to new highs within a generation, study says . The court rejected three other related appeals, including one from Virginia state officials: broader challenges to the EPA's power over carbon emissions. Numerous environmental groups support the administration, saying the court's acceptance of only one legal question was a positive sign. ""Today's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to deny numerous further legal challenges to EPA's science-based determination that six greenhouse gases threaten our nation's health and well-being is a historic victory for all Americans that are afflicted by the ravages of extreme weather,"" said Vickie Patton, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund. ""Those decisions make it abundantly clear, once and for all, that EPA has the both legal authority and the responsibility to address climate change and the carbon pollution that causes it."" This is the second major environmental regulation case that will be heard this term. The justices in December will decide the EPA's ability to measure emissions from an upwind state that is polluting a downwind state, requiring those upwind states to pay for greenhouse gas reductions. Many business groups hope the conservative majority will limit the reach of government in this and a range of regulatory areas, which the Chamber of Commerce and others say is hurting the economy and stifling innovation. ""The EPA's illegal regulations threaten Texas jobs and Texas employers,"" Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said of the agency's policies. ""As Texas has proven in other lawsuits against the EPA, this is a runaway federal agency, so we are pleased the Obama Administration will have to defend its lawless regulations before the U.S. Supreme Court."" The new cases are Chamber of Commerce of the United States v. EPA (12-1272); Texas v. EPA (12-1269); Southeastern Legal Foundation v. EPA (12-1268); Energy-Intensive Manufacturers Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Regulation v. EPA (12-1254); American Chemistry Council v. EPA (12-1248); and Utility Air Regulatory Group v.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Taliban fighters armed with guns and explosives clashed with security forces after taking over a building near the airport in the Afghan capital on Monday. The fighting ended with all seven attackers dead, Afghan officials said. The Taliban said the attack was intended to target Americans in Kabul International Airport, one part of which is used by military forces and another by civilians. The assault on the five-story building, which is under construction, began with two suicide bombers blowing themselves up, said Kabul police official Hashtmat Stanikzai. At least five attackers then stormed into the structure and exchanged fire with security forces, he said. They were eventually killed, said Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for Afghan interior ministry. The attack left two civilians, including a woman, injured -- but no security personnel were hurt, Sediqqi said. NATO's International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan said it was under lock down during the attack but had ""no operational information"" about what was happening. Insurgents have carried out frequent attacks on security forces across Afghanistan in recent months amid a spring offensive by the Taliban. Last month, a suicide car bombing on a coalition convoy in central Kabul killed at least 12 people, six of them American and six Afghan. The insurgent group Hezb-e Islami claimed responsibility for that attack. The group is not under the Taliban leadership, but operates alongside them.","NEW: All seven militants are dead, authorities say .

""I noticed I could see the flames,"" Tobola said. ""I went like, yeah, that's a good sized fire, and so it just drew me a little bit closer."" Almost too close. Tobola pulled out his cell phone to capture it on video, he hit record -- and then all hell broke loose. The plant exploded sending a deadly shock wave through the tight-knit community of 2,800 people, many of them of Czech heritage. ""What I was thinking ... as it exploded ... is, 'am I going to be able to hear when this stops? Is this gonna burn me?' Because, I was like 200 yards away from it."" When it was all over 15 people were dead, 120 homes destroyed and 200 more damaged. In the fraction of a second before the explosion, the video shows a brilliant flash of light, followed by a massive shock wave -- a dome of energy rippling from the blast. ""It definitely was the biggest explosion I've ever seen,"" said Tobola. ""It seems like it lasted forever."" Tobola only released the video this week on the eve of the first anniversary of the April 17, 2013, blast. ""It just wasn't the time or place,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Nearly every day, Terri Shaver comes face to face with cancer and can't help but think about her life and how short it could be. For more than four years, the 56-year-old photographer from Laingsburg, Michigan, has taken free portraits of people with terminal and life-threatening illnesses as part of the Oldham Project, the nonprofit she founded in 2008 after her husband's two sisters-in-law died from breast cancer. Although the Oldham Project, named for the two sisters, provided photos for families and children, Shaver started Be Bold, Feel Beautiful, a campaign specifically aimed at women with cancer, in summer 2010. ""I'll never be the same,"" she said. ""These women are already dealing with the choices of the things they want to accomplish or need to accomplish before their time here is over. They really see the things that are important."" The campaign began as a way to provide the women who lost their hair from cancer treatments photos in which they felt beautiful. Although she had already been taking photos of people with cancer, Shaver wanted to raise awareness, and from her extended family, knew what a powerful effect going bald had on women in particular. ""When they lose their hair, 99.9% of these women have said that they lose themselves,"" she said. ""They lose their identity."" Shaver remembers one woman telling her that when her eyelashes and eyebrows fell out, she looked in the mirror and saw an alien. But when the women see their photos -- some somber and some lighthearted, posing with something significant to them -- they regain their self-image. Shaver said some have even told her that they stopped wearing their wigs after the session. Since the campaign started in July 2010, Shaver has photographed about 100 women -- ages 20 to 82 -- who have had cancer, as well as partnering with a local spa to pamper them and try to make them feel gorgeous for a day. Although it began as a campaign planned to run until October, which is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Shaver said the feedback from the women was overwhelming and she extended the campaign to be a permanent fixture of the Oldham Project. ""Your will has a lot to do with progress that you make when you're sick,"" Shaver said. ""I firmly believe that if I can make women feel better about themselves, while they're undergoing this treatment and have no hair, their treatment will be much more successful."" Before starting a session, Shaver turns up the music in her studio and strives for an optimistic perspective, determined to make the day an uplifting experience for the woman, even though she knows this particular visit is likely a trip woven into a schedule of radiation treatments and countless doctor visits. ""You can't help putting yourself in these women's shoes as I talk to each and every one of them, thinking, 'What if that was me?'"" Shaver said. ""How would I react? How would I deal with that? Many times, I don't even have words."" If she didn't consciously take a more analytical approach to each woman's cancer, Shaver said, the project would be awful. It doesn't mean the emotions are absent, but Shaver, who used to be a nurse, knows she can't take on every burden she witnesses. Toward the end of last fall when Be Bold, Feel Beautiful was in full swing, Shaver was scheduling sessions with up to 10 women a week and began to become physically and emotionally drained. ""I was sleeping three hours a night because I was thinking about the person I photographed yesterday or the woman I was going to,"" she said. ""When you hear these people's stories, you spend a couple hours with them -- photographing them, interviewing them -- you become part of their lives."" She stepped back from updating the campaign's blog -- which was as often as she had a session -- and to her husband's relief, scheduled the portraits at a slower pace to give herself time. Shaver said the only thing more difficult than a session is hearing the news that one of her photo subjects has died. The first was Denise Acker, 55, who died in August 2010 after fighting lung cancer, and was also the very first person to be photographed with Be Bold, Feel Beautiful. Shaver said five women have died since she began and it is devastating every time. Dealing with the grief and looking mortality in the face has made Shaver live differently. She said she doesn't stress out about as many things because she has realized they simply don't matter. What gets her out of bed in the morning when she knows that the day's session will be tough is imagining that she has the ability to watch a woman overcome her insecurities and find peace in how she looks. ""It doesn't matter how bad my day is, I'll bet you their day is worse,"" Shaver said. ""And I'm going to do all I can to make them look as good as I possibly can."" A little more than a year later, Shaver knows it sounds like an extraordinary statement, but she believes the ongoing campaign has the potential to save lives. ""If other women who are just newly diagnosed or haven't even been diagnosed yet see women like this who are strong, powerful, bold and feel good about themselves, they, too, will know that I can do this,"" she said. ""They won't panic when they find a lump, they won't just stick their heads in the sand and hope it'll go away.""","Terri Shaver takes free portraits of people with terminal and life-threatening illnesses .

"(CNN) -- A perpetual deadlock in Congress has resulted in eight extensions of the national transportation bill, causing roads to crumble, bridges to fall, and transit to break down. Come March 2012, politicians will once again enter into a political debate about funding American mobility. Without a fiscal safety net in place, the Highway Trust Fund will go broke. The Republican majority in Congress won't permit the transfer of federal funds from its general spending account to bolster the Highway Trust Fund. And despite the rationality of a user-fee system, neither party will lead the charge to raise the gasoline tax. Few taxes provoke more fury than those at the fuel pump and 2012 is an election year. In reality, cutting the gas tax exacts a steep cost on the entire economy. The gas tax funds a broad range of economy-bolstering transportation projects across the country and it is already too low to meet current (and future) infrastructure needs. It's time to debunk the myths surrounding the maligned gas tax. 1. Americans already pay too much in gas taxes. Not even close. America actually taxes gasoline less than most other nations. Only two countries—Kuwait and Saudi Arabia—charge lower gas taxes than the U.S. and both are net global oil suppliers, not consumers. The U.S. is the world's largest oil consumer. By under-taxing gasoline -- and thus under-pricing gasoline -- the United States encourages over-dependency. Furthermore, the federal gas tax does not even come close to covering the wide array of external social costs of driving cars and trucks. 2. Gas taxes rise every year. Quite the opposite. The federal gas tax has remained unchanged at 18.4 cents for a gallon of gasoline (and 24.4 cents for diesel) for nearly two decades. It is not indexed to the price of crude oil or inflation, so Americans pay a fixed amount whether oil prices are high or low. Ironically, given today's debate, the last time the gas tax was raised in 1993 was for deficit reduction purposes. Taking inflation into account, the gas tax has eroded to only 11 cents today. This has seriously diminished the ability to pay for infrastructure, with a purchasing power of 45 cents in gas taxes for every dollar in national highway construction costs. This means that only one-half of the transportation investments made since 1993 could be afforded today, even though GDP has grown 55% and demands (vehicle miles traveled) have grown 29%. 3. Gas taxes are unnecessary because the transportation system is paid for in other ways. Not so fast. America's transportation system is going broke. Revenue for the Highway Trust Fund is derived almost entirely from federal gas taxes and distributed to all 50 states. It covers nearly 80% of the capital costs of federally-funded transportation projects, with states carrying the remainder. From 2008 to 2010, Congress transferred $34.5 billion from general fund revenues to make up the funding shortfall. This stopgap measure was necessary to continue projects that are already in the works. Moreover, deferred maintenance—the failure to care for existing roads and bridges—combined with lost productivity are estimated to add more than $100 billion to the national deficit annually. Over time, technology will help expand mobility options and improve system efficiency. This includes the ability to track real-time data and charge for system use and facilitate trip decision-making through virtual communications -- social networking, skype, real-time ride-sharing, and on-line meetings. Will pay-per-mile road taxes buzzkill the great American road trip? These 21st-century interactions will bolster economic productivity and competitiveness. But they will take time to mature and, in the near-term, will not obviate the need for travel. Moreover, a dedicated source of revenues, such as gas taxes or other user-based fees, will remain critical to fund and facilitate the transition to technology-oriented transportation solutions. 4. Transportation taxes are detrimental to American competitiveness. Wrong. The reverse is true when it comes to gas taxes. Investing in transportation facilitates reinvestment in America that is vital to economic growth. The U.S., once No. 1 in the world for its infrastructure, has fallen to 15th. China and India are cruising ahead with transportation infrastructure investments each at 9% of GDP compared to 2% in the U.S. This lackluster level of investment prevails despite well-documented needs—aging infrastructure, growing population, and shifting demographics. An upgraded, well-maintained, operationally-efficient transportation system, on the other hand, offers a significant competitive edge. Plus, the gas tax spreads the burden over hundreds of millions of system beneficiaries. Beyond system efficiency gains, vehicles themselves are becoming more fuel-efficient and less wasteful. A proposal to double car- and SUV-fuel economy standards by 2025, while highly beneficial in terms of energy will translate into lower gas tax expenditures by higher-mpg cars. The rational way to deal with this is to increase gas taxes slightly over time to account for the fiscal impacts that cleaner, more efficient cars have on transportation infrastructure investments.Will . 5. Gas taxes make an already volatile gasoline market even worse. Partial thinking. Domestic gas prices are largely influenced by world oil markets. With transportation accounting for about 70% of U.S. oil consumption and record oil-company profits reached when world oil prices go up, it's only fair that oil companies share the cost of providing transportation infrastructure. Structuring an oil fee assessed on producers and a variable gas tax paid by consumers can further stabilize the price at the pump. When oil prices go up, the retail gas tax can be abated. The oil security fee will make up for the revenue gap. When oil prices go down, the gas tax can be slowly reinstated. There isn't much that can be done about external events that affect global oil price volatility, but gas taxes can be designed to better manage abrupt price swings domestically. In short, the transportation system is a critical component of America's economy. The United States cannot be a superpower if it starves public investment in infrastructure. Taxes tend to be more politically acceptable when people understand how funds provide benefits. And nobody understands better than travelers that the nation's infrastructure needs serious improvements. It's time to face the fact: The gas tax is a good way to invest in America. Opinions in this commentary are solely those of Shin-pei Tsay and Deborah Gordon.","Shin-pei Tsay and Deborah Gordon: Infrastructure suffers from congressional inaction .

"London (CNN) -- From a few thousand people traveling by camel in the 7th century to three million a year today: The story of the Hajj -- the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca -- is an epic journey. That journey is celebrated in the first major exhibition dedicated to the Hajj, opening at the British Museum in London on January 26. It includes sacred objects, pictures and the human stories of pilgrims past and present. ""We hope to be able to get across the hardship of the journey in the old days when it was a long journey by camel or by sea and could take two years there and back,"" said Venetia Porter, the exhibition curator. ""Now of course you can go by plane."" Yet despite the changes over the years, it was what hadn't changed which most struck Porter. ""The experience itself doesn't seem to have changed,"" she said. ""If you read the historical accounts of pilgrims in medieval times, their rituals, how they feel and the deep spiritual significance is the same as now."" The exhibition falls into three sections, the first focusing on the journey to Mecca, particularly along the major routes used through history across Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East. The second section focuses on the Hajj today, its rituals and what the experience means to pilgrims. Finally, the exhibition takes on Mecca itself, its origins and importance. Mecca is considered the spiritual center of Islam because it was where the Prophet Mohammed is said to have received his first revelations in the early 7th century. At its heart is the cube-shaped Ka'ba, built by Abraham and his son Ishmael, according to the Quran. The Hajj takes place in the last month of the Islamic year, known as Dhu'l Hijja and includes certain rituals which must be completed. Every Muslim who can is expected to go on Hajj at least once in their lifetime. It took the British Museum more than two years to collect all the objects, which include a seetanah which covers the door of the Ka'ba, archaeological material, manuscripts, textiles, historic photographs and contemporary art. Also on Inside the Middle East: Finding freedom behind bars . The exhibition was put together with the help of the King Abdulaziz Public Library in Riyadh, which arranged the loan of some objects which had never before been taken outside Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Ambassador to Britain, HRH Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf Al Saud, said: ""Hajj is not just a physical journey, it's the most extraordinary spiritual journey every Muslim takes. ""We leave our families and our homes to undertake this profound life-changing experience. ""It doesn't guarantee passage to Heaven, but it focuses us on what's important in life. ""It's a sensitive issue for the British Museum to tackle and we had long discussions to make sure it was accurate. Eventually they did an excellent job."" Porter said: ""The most challenging aspect for us was to turn it from a mere collection of objects into something evocative of the strong spiritual experience. ""The way we did it was to include quotes and voices from pilgrims."" To accompany its exhibition, the British Museum invited Muslims to recount their own experiences on its website, and hundreds have done so. One, Kamran Majid, from London, wrote: ""The moment you enter the Harem Mosque and first lay eyes on the Ka'ba feels like the day you are truly born of life, your soul, heart and eyes soften and ease to the glorious sight."" Also on Inside the Middle East: Youth march 'shows true spirit' Another, Amal Alabdulkarim, from Riyhad, wrote: ""Hajj is the journey of pureness, love, hope and optimism. It taught me humility, patience and justice."" Sophia Khan, from Slough, UK, wrote: ""My most memorable moment was when I just happened to sit on some steps looking out to the Ka'ba. There were thousands of people from all over the world circumambulating this sacred structure at the center of the Earth, all there for a common purpose of praising God, yet each engaged in private reflection oblivious of any other.""","British Museum hosts first major exhibition on Hajj .

"(CNN) -- NBC has issued an apology for spoiling the results of teen swimmer Missy Franklin's gold medal-winning race. In the latest controversy during the network's highly rated Summer Olympics coverage, NBC ran a ""Today"" show promo on Monday night that revealed the outcome of the heavily anticipated 100-meter backstroke before the event was actually telecast. Now NBC's sports division, which has been pretty adamant about the merits of its tape-delay strategy as public criticism mounts, has issued a statement admitting the network screwed up. ""Clearly that promo should not have aired at that time,"" said an NBC Sports spokesperson in a statement. ""We have a process in place and this will not happen again. We apologize to viewers who were watching and didn't know the result of the race."" NBC's Today show ad announced last night, ""When you're 17 years old and win your first gold medal, there's nobody you'd rather share it with,"" and showed footage of Franklin holding the gold medal and with her parents. NBC's attempt to herd viewers to primetime with tape-delayed coverage from London while covering a competition of global interest has sparked plenty of online outrage since the Games got underway on Friday (one critic dubbed the 2012 games ""the last great buggy-whip Olympics""). Yet ratings continue to be strong, with 31.6 million viewers watching Monday's primetime coverage, the biggest audience for a non-U.S. Summer Games in 36 years. Meanwhile one vocal critic of NBC whose Twitter account was suspended after he tweeted a network executive's email address has been given his account back. ""Oh.

"(CNN) -- ""We are innocent."" For six years, that has been the cry that has united Amanda Knox and her Italian ex-boyfriend, as they have faced trials in the murder of Knox's former roommate Meredith Kercher. But that unity may be crumbling, as she and Raffaele Sollecito prepare to appeal their convictions before Italy's Supreme Court next year. Knox, who is living in the United States, appears to be sticking by the maxim. Just over two weeks ago, she posted it in a photo to her Facebook page in Italian: ""Siamo innocente."" But Sollecito, who is still in Italy, no longer seems so adamant about it, as the prospect of a long prison term stares him in the face. He was sentenced to 25, Knox to 28 years in prison. Yes, but . Though he still says that the evidence exonerates them both, he is using more selective language. ""There is nothing against me and nothing very strong against Amanda,"" Sollecito recently told CNN. ""And in my case, I really did nothing wrong, and I don't want to pay for someone else's peculiar behavior."" Knox's behavior on the morning Kercher was found stabbed to death in the apartment she and Knox shared seems to be a new hitch for Sollecito. That was early November 2007, and he and Knox had only been dating for a week. Sollecito expanded on his doubts in a new interview with Italian television this week that aired in part on NBC. Knox had spent the night with him but went back to her place to shower, he said. When she returned, she was ""very agitated."" She told him that it looked like someone had broken in and that there was blood in the bathroom, Sollecito said. But rather than call the police, she showered and returned to his place. He finds it odd, he now says. ""Certainly I asked her questions,"" he said. ""Why did you take a shower? Why did she spend so much time there?"" He didn't get any real answers from her, he said in the interview. Lawyer's advice . Sollecito's apparent distancing from Knox echoes the position of his lawyer, John Kelly. ""It's imperative that the Italian courts consider Raffaele's case separate from Amanda's case,"" he said. ""By necessity, he has to distance himself and his case from Amanda and her case."" In a note on her Facebook page, Knox acknowledges Sollecito's new stance and appears to back it up. She said he's a scapegoat. ""The only reason he has been dragged into this is because he happens to be my alibi,"" she wrote. Since Kercher's death, Knox and Sollecito have gone through a legal odyssey that led to a conviction that was overturned, followed by a second conviction. Another man, drifter and drug dealer Rudy Guede from the Ivory Coast is currently serving 16 years for Kercher's murder. He was tried separately from Knox and Sollecito. He admitted having sex with the young British woman but said someone else killed her while he was in the bathroom.","The united cry of innocence may be crumbling, as Raffaele Sollecito changes his tone .

"(CNN) -- France's World Cup nightmare finally came to an end in Bloemfontein but hosts South Africa narrowly failed to prevent Mexico and Uruguay progressing from Group A. Luis Suarez scored the only goal of the game in the battle of the two Latin American teams, but South Africa could not take advantage to pull off a famous turnaround in the group. The hosts did at least salvage some pride with a 2-1 defeat of France, but they become the first host nation to exit at the group stage in World Cup history. As for France, their miserable competition is over, but they did at least register their first goal, as Florent Malouda struck to half the deficit. In a week that saw striker Nicolas Anelka sent home in disgrace, the players refuse to train and two senior officials quit in disgust, coach Raymond Domenech's reign of the national side has now come to an end. Former France captain Laurent Blanc will be his replacement. Uruguay go through as Group A winners and will now face whoever comes second in Group B -- likely to be Nigeria or South Korea. Mexico will face Argentina if Diego Maradona's side top that group. South Africa 2-1 France . After a tumultuous week Domenech made six changes to the side that faced Mexico, and dropped captain Patrice Evra from the squad altogether. Pedro Pinto: Heads should roll for French farce . It was South Africa who opened the scoring on 20 minutes when Bongani Khumalo bundled home a corner after a flap from France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. Replays suggested the ball hit the South African player's arm. Things went from bad to worse for France when midfielder Yoann Gourcuff was sent off for an elbow on Siphiwe Tshabalala. And the hosts doubled their advantage 11 minutes later when Tsepo Masilela's cross fell to Katlego Mphela who stabbed the ball home at the far post. Barcelona striker Thierry Henry was finally given a taste of World Cup action in the 55th minute and he flashed a shot wide within moments of his introduction. But in the 70th minute France finally broke their duck in the tournament as Franck Ribery ran onto Bacary Sagna's pass before squaring to second-half substitute Florent Malouda to tap into an empty net. Mphela hit the crossbar after a through ball from Tshabalala, and Tshabalala himself came close right at the end when he forced Lloris into a smart save. At the final whistle an angry Domenech refused to shake hands with South Africa coach Carlos Alberto Parreira and he later told reporters: ""The over-riding emotion is one of sadness. ""We would have liked the dream to have continued. I shook hands with the players because we have been through some difficult times together. We need to be dignified in victory and defeat. ""I have had a splendid adventure for the last six years, good times and bad times. It is impossible to summarize at the moment what has happened. ""I cannot analyze things yet. I am not concerned about myself only the French team and its future. Good luck to my successor and the French team. I wish them all the best. I will be their number one fan."" Uruguay 1-0 Mexico . Uruguay and Mexico knew that a draw would send them both through to the second round but with Argentina the likely opponent for whoever finished second in the group, the Latin American sides set out for victories. Uruguay had an early chance to go in front when striker Luis Suarez sprang the offside trap, only to fire narrowly wide of the post. The 10 biggest World Cup shocks . Guillermo Franco had the next opportunity as Mexico responded but he failed to make contact with the ball from inside the area. Andres Guardado then hit the bar for Mexico with a thunderbolt of a shot from 30 yards but just before halftime Uruguay made the breakthrough. Edinson Cavani got down the left before his pinpoint cross was met at the far post by Luis Suarez, who powered a header into the net. Veteran striker Cuauhtémoc Blanco had an early chance to draw Mexico level but his free-kick was hit right at Uruguay 'keeper Fernando Muslera. Then Pablo Barrera created a golden opportunity for defender Franciso Rodriguez, but he nodded tamely wide from the penalty spot. As the game entered its final stage Uruguay seemed content to hold onto their slender advantage, and Mexico couldn't find the cutting edge to break them down. But at the final whistle both Latin American teams were through to the second round.","Uruguay and Mexico qualify from Group A of World Cup .

"(CNN) -- World football officials are defending their refusal to allow the Iranian women's soccer team to wear head scarves while playing in an Olympic qualifying round in Amman, Jordan. FIFA safety rules enacted last year allow women to wear ""a cap that covers their head to the hairline, but which does not extend below the ears to cover the neck,"" according to a statement released by FIFA Monday. Iran's coach chose to forfeit last Friday's match with Jordan rather than dressing players in the smaller FIFA-approved head covering. ""Despite initial assurances that the Iranian delegation understood this, the players came out wearing the hijab, and the head and neck totally covered, which was an infringement of the laws of the game,"" FIFA said. Three players on Jordan's team who wanted to wear hijab scarves for religious reason also sat out the match, FIFA said. The FIFA statement concluded that match officials ""decided to apply correctly the laws of the game, which ended in the match being abandoned.""","FIFA defend their decision to ban players from wearing hijab scarves during matches .
Iran's women's team chose to forfeit match with Jordan rather than remove scarves .
FIFA banned the hijab in 2007 because of potential choking danger ."
"(CNN) -- The boxed set: Criticized for its brick-like presence. Victim of grammatical ineptitude (it's usually called the ""box set,"" which is what? A collection of boxes?). Subject of a hilarious Barenaked Ladies song. And, sometimes, repository of surprise. Yes, in these downloadable times, the CD and DVD boxed set seems quaint, an item for libraries and completists. Will anyone watch the entire run of ""Hogan's Heroes""? Is there really enough Big Star material to fill a four-disc collection? Still, this year saw the release of a number of worthwhile CD and DVD boxed sets. As we head into the final shopping weekend before Christmas, here are a few worth checking out from beginning to end. (Prices listed are full retail, but feel free to shop around.) CDs . ""Backtracks,"" AC/DC (Sony Legacy, 2 CDs and 1 DVD, $39.98) AC/DC's heavy metal hits are well known, but their rarities and certain singles have been the province of hard-core fans -- until now. ""Backtracks"" includes a disc of studio obscurities, a disc of live cuts and a DVD of videos. (A special edition, available directly from www.acdcbacktracks.com, is housed in a fully operational amplifier; it's $179.) It's worth banging your head over. ""The Beatles in Mono,"" the Beatles (Capitol/EMI, 13 CDs, $298.98) The Beatles used to mix the majority of their material twice: once in stereo and once in mono. The latter was actually the preferred form, as many listeners didn't own what used to be called a hi-fi. With the remastering of the Fab Four's catalog, the original mono mixes are now completely available on CD, in some cases for the first time. It's an expensive box (and, moreover, the mono albums aren't for sale individually), but for the hard-core fan, it's worth it. ""Twelve Nights in Hollywood,"" Ella Fitzgerald (Hip-O Select, 4 CDs, $69.98) In 1961 and 1962, Verve Records taped the peerless Ella Fitzgerald at a Los Angeles nightclub. It's taken just under 50 years, but a healthy sampling of Fitzgerald's performance is finally available on CD. (An LP released at the time was poorly mastered and sank with little trace.) This was Fitzgerald at her peak, performing songs such as ""Come Rain or Come Shine,"" ""Mack the Knife"" and (of course) ""Too Darn Hot."" ""Dolly,"" Dolly Parton (Sony Legacy, 4 CDs, $49.98) If you think Dolly Parton is just ""9 to 5"" and ""Islands in the Stream,"" take a listen to this expansive collection of 99 tracks, covering the late '50s through the early '90s. Yes, the later pop hits are here, but the meat of the selection comes from her country years with Porter Wagoner and as a solo act, including ""Coat of Many Colors,"" ""Last Thing on My Mind"" and ""The Bridge."" And she's not only a fine singer but a terrific songwriter. ""Woodstock 40 Years On: Back to Yasgur's Farm"" (Rhino, 6 CDs, $79.98) This summer marked the 40th anniversary of the world's most famous rock festival, and though it's never been hard to find the movie soundtrack albums around, this giant set features much more than those recordings ever did. Though there are key omissions -- Ten Years After is particularly conspicuous -- the music has never sounded better. (For those who want the complete Woodstock experience, a DVD boxed set of the movie is also available. Throw in some mud and brown acid, and you're practically back in 1969.) DVDs . ""AK100: 25 Films of Akira Kurosawa"" (Criterion, 25 DVDs, $399.95) Outside of an accompanying book, this monumental box doesn't come with many extras. But who needs extras when you have some of the greatest films of the 20th century -- ""Seven Samurai,"" ""Rashomon,"" ""Throne of Blood"" -- by one of the century's greatest filmmakers? If you don't have much Kurosawa in your collection, here's a place to start. ""Andy Richter Controls the Universe"" (Paramount, 3 DVDs, $39.98) and ""Andy Barker, P.I."" (Shout! Factory, 2 DVDs, $24.99) After Andy Richter left the role as Conan O'Brien's sidekick, a spot to which he has returned, he did these two vastly underrated comedies. In ""Universe,"" he's a tech writer who goes on flights of fancy; in ""Barker"" (co-produced by O'Brien), he's a CPA mistaken for a private detective. Inspired silliness reigns in both, and it's too bad neither got enough of an audience for a long run. ""Paul Newman: The Tribute Collection"" (20th Century Fox, 17 DVDs, $89.98) This collection of Newman films is a decidedly mixed bag -- ""From the Terrace"" and ""What a Way to Go!"" are not among his best work -- but it also includes a two-disc ""Hustler,"" two-disc ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" and the two-disc edition of perhaps his greatest performance, ""The Verdict."" For those who admire Newman, a nice career overview. ""Thirtysomething: The Complete First Season"" (Shout! Factory, 6 DVDs, $59.95) You can see the influence of the prototypical series of the '80s in countless dramas that have followed, from the delicate soundtrack (by W.G. Snuffy Walden) to densely written characters (Aaron Sorkin should pay royalties). But Marshall Herskovitz's and Edward Zwick's show still stands alone for its ability to develop drama from the everyday, without leaning on cops or doctors. (Future seasons saw the arrival of ad exec Miles Drentell, one of the great characters in TV history.) ""The Wizard of Oz"" (Warner Home Video, 5 DVDs, $69.92) and ""Gone With the Wind"" (Warner Home Video, 6 DVDs, $69.92) Two classic movies from that classic year for movies, 1939, get lavish 70th-anniversary editions. ""Oz""  has a number of new extras from previous editions, including some ""Oz"" films from the silent era. ""GWTW"" includes art cards, a journal and a book of production art. Both are also available in two-disc versions (as well as Blu-ray).","Plenty of interesting CD, DVD boxed sets available in time for holidays .
""The Beatles in Mono"" collects Fab Four's mono mixes .
Criterion has a 25-disc Akira Kurosawa collection ."
