"Arsenal have opened talks with Porto over a deal for Colombia midfielder Juan Quintero. Such a move would place further question marks over the future of Atletico Madrid target Santi Cazorla but reports out of South America on Thursday night said a fee has been agreed for £15.8m and that Quintero was on a flight to London Heathrow. The 21-year-old's agent Maria Elena Chavarro tweeted on Thursday: 'Today @juanferquinte10 travelled to England to sign a contract with Arsenal who are paying 20m Euros (around £15.8m) to FCPorto, congratulations!'

Young gun: Quintero scored for Colombia against Ivory Coast during the World Cup . Doubts: The move increases speculation of Santi Cazorla's potential departure from the club . Quintero took a flight From Medellin to Bogota before flying to Heathrow with a ticket for seat 6A according to Colombian reports. He was in Jose Pekerman's World Cup squad that reached the quarter-finals in Brazil. The youngster came off the bench in their second group game against Ivory Coast, scoring the goal that put Colombia 2-0 up, and started their 4-1 win over Japan in their final group game. And then appeared as a sub again with 10 minutes to go in their last-eight match as they lost against the host nation. Rio Ferdinand was one of those to praise Quintero last year, saying: ‘I watched the Under 20 World Cup and there was a kid called (Juan) Quintero playing for Colombia. ‘The way he receives the ball, you don’t really see young players in our country doing that.' However, another of Quintero's representatives, Ricardo Calleri, claims the 21-year-old will not leave Porto unless his buy-out is triggered, though he says his client has a number of suitors throughout Europe. 'Porto have never talked about negotiating the sale of Juan Quintero,' Calleri told MaisFutebol. 'Of course, there are clubs interested. There is a lot of interest from clubs from Spain and England in the player. 'But in order for him to leave, a club has to pay his buy-out clause.'","Arsenal have held talks with Porto over a move for Juan Quintero .

"He's a decade off being able to drink it but that hasn't stopped a Colorado sixth-grader from developing a way to brew beer in space. Michal Bodzianowski, 11, will soon get the chance to test his method, after he beat nearly 4,000 students to win a National Center for Earth and Space Science Education competition recently. 'He came up with this idea all on his own,' Michal's teacher and sponsor at the STEM School and Academy in Colorado, Sharon Combs, said. Beer: Michal Bodzianowski, 11, is a decade off being able to drink it but that hasn't stopped a Colorado sixth-grader from developing a way to brew beer in space . She added, in an interview with ABC News: 'He got a book for Christmas that was about weird facts and explains how in the Middle Ages they used to drink beer because it was purer than water.' While astronauts might find kicking back with a cold one after a day's work in space refreshing, Michal said his idea was beneficial for 'both medical and survival reasons, and it is fairly easy to conduct with limited human interactions.' The NCESSE sponsored the competition as part of the Student Spaceflight Experiments Program, which strives to inspire the next generation of America's scientists and engineers. Eleven proposals, out of 744 submitted by 3,900 students, were selected for the flight and include a range of students from grades 5 to 11. Science whiz: Michal will be given a real research mini-laboratory that is scheduled to fly on the International Space Station in the coming months . 'I never expected it to be one of my sixth graders,' Combs told ABC. 'But Michal's got the natural curiosity of people who go after science. He's very talented.' Michal will be given a real research mini-laboratory that is scheduled to fly on the International Space Station in the coming months. His experiment will be prepared on the ground and then sent up to space with an astronaut who will combine the substances and follow his instructions. Meanwhile, the six-grader will conduct the experiment on Earth, to see how it differs.

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez relishes the prospect of facing Arsenal because they are not a 'parasite' on the Premier League with their approach to matches like some teams they face. Martinez shares a similar football philosophy to Arsenal counterpart Arsene Wenger, who he will attempt to outwit at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday afternoon. And the Spaniard also believes players prefer to work under the likes of himself and Wenger because the style of play of their teams. Everton manager Roberto Martinez admits his side face a difficult task against Arsenal on Sunday . Everton striker Romelu Lukaku celebrates after scoring a penalty against Young Boys on Thursday . 'Too many times you see a team that go for being a parasite; they give you the ball, defend, be destructive,' Martinez said. 'That system doesn't develop players. It's the opposite – every two years they burn players. They need new players and they need new players to do things players don't enjoy doing. 'I believe the way the game should be played is in a specific manner; taking risks, and getting on the ball and relying on the talent of the players to score goals.' Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has been criticised for his team's style of play this season, while Jose Mourinho's Chelsea teams have been dubbed anti-football in the past. Wenger lambasted Tony Pulis, when he was Stoke manager, for 'rugby' tactics while the Frenchman also had rows with Sam Allardyce and Martin O'Neill among others. Arsenal will be looking to bounce back after a disappointing night in the Champions League this week . Kevin Mirallas scored Everton's third goal during Everton's 3-1 victory over Young Boys in the last 32 . However, Martinez was decidedly more cautious when asked which managers or teams he was referring to with his parasite comments. He added: 'Unfortunately you get too many managers achieving success with another type of football. 'Who? I am sure you can figure it out! You can analyse teams over history, and there are parasite teams. 'Our team is as good as it could be in terms of human quality and the quality that we've got football-wise.' Meanwhile, Martinez has told Belgium winger Kevin Mirallas, who has been linked with a move away from Goodison Park, that he must remain patient over a new contract. Mirallas is understood to want to open negotiations over improved terms but must bide his time. 'Are we in talks? Not at the moment,' Martinez explained. 'We're going to leave every individual situation until further down the line. 'I do feel that talking about individual situations can be distracting at this point. 'We'll look at the players who are out of contract first and foremost because they're more urgent but players like Kevin Mirallas who has two-and-a-half years left on his contract is not something we need to consider yet.'","Roberto Martinez criticises managers who defend too much .

"A trapped climber had to have his leg amputated after jamming his foot between rocks in a harrowing cliff-side scene reminiscent of the film 127 hours. Tsenolo Shadrack Rasello had his limb severed after getting stuck in a cave for almost 50 hours while hiking in  the dangerous Magaliesberg mountain range near Johannesburg in South Africa, . After calling for help from his mobile phone, rescuers were forced to perform the procedure on Sunday. Scroll down for videos . A climber had to have his leg amputated in a cave after becoming stuck in between rocks in the Magaliesberg mountain range near Johannesburg. A rescue worker lowers a stretcher to reach Tsenolo Shadrack Rasello . The Mountain Club of South Africa scrambled seven helicopters and a rescue team to help Mr Rasello when he called for help from his mobile phone . After landing on the mountain late last Friday, the team abseiled down the cliff-side the following day to reach Mr Rasello who had not had any water for more than 24 hours . The 26-year-old was airlifted from the dangerous mountain range near Johannesburg after having his right leg amputated. He was in a stable condition in an intensive care unit this week . His ordeal bears striking similarities with the story of Aron Ralston, the American climber whose decision to cut off his own forearm to escape from a Utah canyon while trapped inspired the Hollywood film starring James Franco. Seven helicopters were scrambled and more than 100 emergency service workers involved when Mr Rasello, 26, called for help from his mobile phone on Sunday. The 26-year-old had searching for 'holy water' in streams on the mountain range last Friday when he was startled by a snake and slid down in between two rocks. 'There is no amount of explaining that can really explain the predicament this fellow was in,' said Rob Thomas of the Mountain Club of South Africa, who led the rescue team. 'It was way, way, way worse than what I envisioned,' he told the Daily Telegraph. More than 100 people and seven helicopters were involved in the rescue operation from the dangerous Magaliesberg mountain range (pictured) After calling for help, the team arrived late on Friday but could not reach him until the following day, when they abseiled down the side of the mountain to find the man parched and 'terrified'. 'Can I please, please, please have some water. I've had nothing to drink since yesterday morning,' is what the man, who is unemployed, first told rescuers. Though weary after having been stuck for so long, the climber knew his only chance of survival was to have his leg amputated. ''Listen, if you have to take the leg off, take the leg off. But get me out of here,'"" is what he is said to have told the team. A trauma surgeon amputated his leg on Sunday with the help of anesthetist and paramedic, who stayed with the man for hours on the eve of the procedure. 'I think he was terrified of being abandoned,' added Thomas. Frank Plani, the surgeon who carried out the operation, described conditions in the cave as 'unsteady'. Mr Rasello's ordeal bears striking resemblance to that of Aron Ralston, played by James Franco (pictured) in the film 127 hours . Mr Ralston was forced to cut off his arm after it became stuck between boulders while he was climbing in Utah in 2003. Here the adventurer bravely reconstructs the excruciating act . 'He was in a harness that allowed his body to be moved up and down a bit to facilitate the operation,' he said. Mr Rasello was taken to the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in Johannesburg, where he was in a stable condition this week. While his ordeal is similar to that of Aron Ralston,  played by James Franco in the Hollywood sensation 127 hours, Rasello had the advantage of being able to call for help. Mr Ralston was forced to amputate his arm with a pocketknife after becoming trapped between boulders in southern Utah.","Tsenolo Shadrack Rasello had leg amputated after being stuck for 50 hours .

"The daughter of former reality show star Will Hayden, who was arrested last month on child molestation charges, is now claiming that she too was sexually abused as a child by her father. Stephanie Hayden, who also starred in the recently cancelled Discovery reality show ‘Sons Of Guns’, is reportedly set to provide information to law enforcement in the coming days to aid in her father’s prosecution. Her decision sparks a dramatic turnaround as she had originally pledged to stand by her father despite his arrest on August 9 for the alleged sexual abuse of her 12-year-old sister. 'There was never any impropriety in our home,' she said at the time. 'He was and is a good father.' Scroll down for video . Stephanie Hayden, left, the daughter of reality show star Will Hayden, right, is now claiming that she too was sexually abused as a child by her father in Baton Rouge, Louisiana . Stephanie is now recanting her original statement and is set to meet with investigators in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to provide specific details of the sexual abuse she allegedly suffered, reports TMZ. ‘After 45 shows and 20 years, this is the first I've heard of it,’ an attorney for her father told TMZ. ‘Her complaints arose only after her income from the show and [gun] shop stopped. She's still Will's daughter, and he loves her.’ Hayden, 49, was initially arrested on August 9 on charges of molestation of a child and a crime against nature. The gun store owner posted $150,000 bond the same day and was released. He told TMZ at the time that his ex-girlfriend, who is the mother of one of his daughters, went to authorities a week ago and accused him of molesting the girl. He said that she did it as revenge for him ending their relationship.Hayden had since married and was bringing up the girl with his new wife. Sons of Guns first aired on the Discovery Channel in 2011 and followed Hayden's life at the helm of a gun store, Red Jacket Firearms . The youngster returned to his home after he was interviewed by Child Protective Services. Hayden was then re-arrested on August 26 and charged with aggravated rape charges involving a child and bail was at $250,000 . According to allegations in an affidavit filed by sheriff's deputies, Hayden began having sex with the child, then 11 years old, in 2013. The latest rape, the report said, happened in July. A guardian of the victim had contacted deputies on August 16. The victim confided to the guardian after Hayden's August 9 arrest, according to the report. Deputies said they met with the child and guardian and took a statement. According to the affidavit, the child told deputies Hayden took her virginity when she was 11 years old and that sex acts happened almost daily thereafter. In the wake of Hayden’s second arrest, Stephanie’s husband Kristafor Ford posted a poem on Facebook in which he accused his wife’s father of molesting her as a child . Stephanie, left, is set to recant her original statement and meet with investigators in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to provide specific details of the sexual abuse she allegedly suffered at the hands of her father, right . The report says Hayden coerced the victim into silence with threats of physical abuse. 'Don't tell them nothing because I'm all you've got,' the affidavit says the 49-year-old Hayden told the victim. After her father's initial arrest, Stephanie had defended him on Facebook. 'This was a false allegation and unfortunately that's all it takes,' she wrote. 'My father is a good man, and ALL of his children love him very much and are truly sickened that a person would try to do this to our family. Its not right [sic]. You see the love we have for our family... 'The one thing that really hurts us is that my sister is heartbroken that anyone could think this of her father. Its a nightmare...please stand with us.' But then in the wake of Hayden’s second arrest, Stephanie’s husband Kristafor Ford posted a poem on Facebook in which he accused his wife’s father of molesting her as a child. Stephanie posted to a family member on Facebook that she had given her husband permission to post his poem about being abused - both posts were taken down soon after. 'You fooled with my wife when she was young. Sucking and groping, do you remember what was done? Well she does, and she told me how you made her feel,' he wrote. Stephanie then posted that she had given her husband permission to post it. Both posts were  taken down soon after. Sons of Guns first aired on the Discovery Channel in 2011 and followed Hayden's life at the helm of a gun store, Red Jacket Firearms. Episodes often showed him and Stephanie helping customers find weapons, including rifles. Other scenes showed the process of making the guns, images from firing ranges, and ammunition tips. After the arrest, The Discovery Channel cancelled the show, citing ‘the serious and horrific nature of the charges’ against Hayden. Red Jacket Firearms has also legally cut ties with him.","Reality show star Will Hayden was arrested last month and charged with child molestation of his 12-year-old daughter .

"An archeological treasure trove unearthed by a team from the Open University could transform our understanding of Stonehenge. The most significant artifacts uncovered . are two carved ducks, the first of their kind to be found in Britain . and the oldest figurines ever hewn from the UK. The ducks were likely, say the team, to be a . result of the Bronze Age tradition of carving animal figurines which . were then thrown into water as offerings. Quacking find: These two stone carvings in the shape of ducks, dated to around 700BC, were discovered near Stonehenge and are thought to be the oldest ever unearthed in Britain . Amazing find: A trove of artifacts unearthed near Stonehenge suggests there were humans at the site for 3,000 years before the monument was built . But while the ducks date back to 700BC, a ceremonial dagger was also found which originated around 1400BC. However, another item which Jacques . initially believed was a cow's tooth was revealed by radiocarbon dating . to date back to around 6250BC, some 3,000 years before work began on . Stonehenge. It was part of a . tranche of more than 200 animal bones that were buried alongside . evidence of a large fire, suggesting a Mesolithic feast for up to 100 . people. The bones transpired not to be from cows but instead from aurochs, a now extinct animal about the size of a buffalo. 'It's probably one the earliest recorded hot meals in Briton too, with these people likely cooking this huge creature,' Open University tutor David Jacques, who led the field work, told Mail Online. The Mesolithic era is essentially the mid-period of the stone age. It is sandwiched between the other two 'lithics' - Paleolithic (Old Stone Age) and the Neolithic (New Stone Age). In Europe, the Mesolithic period covered the period from around 9660BC to 5000BC. However, given that civilisation developed at different paces on different continents, it took place in Japan between 14,000BC-400BC and in Western Asia between 20,000BC and 9500BC. It is also sometimes referred to as the Epipaleolithic era. Further excavations revealed a hoarde of more than 5,500 worked flints and tools. Given . that only a few Mesolithic items had ever previously been found around . Stonehenge, the discovery is strong evidence of the continuity of human . life at the site. That means Stonehenge could have been . a site of great significance to humans for several thousand years . before the monument was built. Mr Jacques, . who runs a course on Roman History, used his OU students to excavate a site . north east of the Iron Age hill fort known as Vespasian's Camp. Digging down into the bed of a former . spring revealed a trove of artifacts, though the team did not . immediately recognise the significance of their find. Mystical spot: Stonehenge remains a spiritual site attended by pagans for ceremonies such as the solstice in summer and winter, and appears to have been that way for since 6250BC . Two examples of the flint tools uncovered at the site near Stonehenge . Last year the team dug a trench in the . south east corner of the spring and discovered a . late Roman layer, an Iron Age layer and an early Bronze Age layer before uncovering the flint tools. Initially the team believed it was a mixed cache of . early prehistoric tools, contemporary with . Stonehenge. But once the lab work was underway and experts at Cambridge, where Mr Jacques is studying for a PHD, suggested the finds were all Mesolithic, the team realised the magnitude of their find. 'It's not a surprise because we new . there was a Mesolithic monument there somewhere, because of the (totem) posts . that were found during the excavation of the car park some years ago,' said Mr Jacques. 'The massive missing link . between those two things has been that there is no evidence of people using them until now. Excavations: Open University tutor David Jacques, who led the expedition, with part of the pelvis of an auroch and, right, one of the early trenches dug on the site . 'But what is surprising is that a little team like us with a very low budget have discovered it.' The find is now the property of the landowners Sir Edward and Lady Antrobus, who gave Mr Jacques permission to carry out the excavation. However, there are plans for a new museum to be built in the local town of Amesbury, largely on the back of this discovery, and the artifacts could be housed at that museum, when it is completed. In keeping with the Open University tradition, Mr Jacques is keen to have the local community involved, and that approach is ultimately what yielded the historic find. Before commencing the work he consulted the custodian of the site for 33 years, Mike Clarke, and asked where he thought merited exploration. Mr Clarke suggested three sites, of which the spring was most likely to bear archaeological fruit in Mr Jacques' opinion. 'Mike is someone who, if you ask for his advice, he will be very generous, but I don't think anyone else had ever asked his opinion before,' said Mr Jacques.","Duck figurines are oldest ever found in Britain and part of significant archeological haul .

"With a perfect copy of the New Moon film poster emblazoned across her back, portraits of Edward Cullen on both ribs and the Cullen crest splashed across her breastbone, describing Cathy Ward, 52, as a Twilight fan is a bit of an understatement. But there's more to the Twihard's tattoos than a penchant for Robert Pattison, although the self-confessed member of Team Edward admits that it does play a part. For Cathy, her etchings are also an important reminder of how far she's come since Christmas 2009, when she weighed six stone more and was an unhappy size 24 - and a reward. Twihard: 52-year-old Cathy Ward has spent just under £8,500 on inkings that depict characters from Twilight . Commitment: Cathy Ward's first tattoo was this full-back poster of the New Moon film . Yet trading comfort eating for Twilight tattoos hasn't come cheap, as she happily admits. So far, she has spent just under £8,500 on getting inked but expects to have spent £25,000 by the time her 'body suit' is complete. 'I've had about 91 hours of tattooing now and it's costing a small fortune,' explains Cathy, who works as a baker for the Morrisons supermarket chain in her hometown of Reading. 'I've forked out just under £8,500 and by the time I'm finished, when [my] body's completely covered, we're looking at between £17,000 and £25,000.' Cathy's passion for ink began after a friend handed her a copy of the first Twilight book at the end of 2009. Hooked, she quickly devoured the first novel and sped through the remaining three before buying the DVDs and soundtracks of the accompanying films. Her first tattoo, an elaborate recreation of the film poster for New Moon, followed with more etchings added two weeks later. 'We've got the book covers, we've got the ribbon, we've got the family crest, we've got the hairpiece, we've got the chessboard from Breaking Dawn, we've got the wolf tribal symbol,' she reveals. 'I've had five wolves done and one of the last things Jacob says to [Bella] when he realises he's lost her. He said: ""It would be as easy as breathing with me"".' Perfect portrait: Kristen Stewart, Taylor Lautner and, of course, Robert Pattinson have pride of place . Recovery: Mrs Ward's obsession with Twilight tattoos acts as a reminder to her of pulling through the depression and subsequent obesity after she lost her mother . But . despite her love for the Wolf Pack - the subject of an inking currently . underway on her left leg - it's Edward, played in the films by Robert . Pattinson, who interests her the most. 'Obviously, I'm Team Edward so most of my tattoos are of Edward,' she explains. 'I'm definitely a Robert Pattinson fan. 'It's . because he's not classically good looking - he's different,' she adds. 'I'm not what I'd call good looking, I'm average and he's similar. Plenty of other guys in the film are better looking but he's striking in . different way.' Since . discovering Twilight, Cathy has lost an incredible six stone and says . that having the tattoos is a permanent reminder of just how far she's . come since 1999 when the shock of losing her mother resulted in an . unhealthy obsession with food. 'That's when I started going really hell for leather doing what I wanted and abusing my body,' remembers Cathy. 'I was sitting down, overeating, just vegetating all the time. I was ashamed of myself and what I looked like. 'When . my friend gave me the first book and I got well and truly hooked on it, . it kind of focused me. Of course, then I got the music, the soundtracks . to all of the movies, so I got them out, I'd exercise to them and I'd . be watching a DVD and I'd just be exercising in front of them. Trading comfort eating for Twilight tattoos hasn't come cheap - shes spent just under £8,500 on getting inked but expects to spend £25,000 in total getting covered . 'And then I'd get another tattoo and it'd just give me something to focus on. I've lost six stone and that's what did it. 'It's a permanent reminder and a reward to me for getting my life back on track to what it should be.' But . not everyone is as supportive of Cathy's decision to get inked. Although her husband Colin, to whom she's been married for 21 years, . tolerates her tattoos, not everyone in her family agrees. 'My . father, at first he was very resistant,' she says. 'He wouldn't be seen . out with me. My brother, I haven't spoken to in five years. He's quite . embarrassed by me. 'My . sisters... they're just quite glad to see me come out of my shell and be . who I should be. I used to be very quiet, sort of hide in the . background, be a bit of a wallflower.' She . certainly isn't anymore and revels in the stir she caused when she was . invited onto the red carpet at the Breaking Dawn part one premiere in . 2011. 'I got sent tickets to . the premiere, which was brilliant although security wouldn't let me . near the main characters,' remembers Cathy with a chuckle. 'But the fans reaction was brilliant - it was an hour and a half of mayhem because they all wanted pictures with me.' Her . tattoos also got her the attention of Taylor Lautner, the 21-year-old . American who plays Jacob, who, to her delight, even mentioned her in an . interview. Tolerant: Cathy's husband Colin says he is happy for her to have tattoos provided they don't go on her face . Quote: Her right arm shows a line uttered by Jacob that reads: 'It would be as easy as breathing with me' So far Mrs Ward's spent 91 hours under the needle, costing her £8,500, but she still plans lots more and aims to cover her entire body . 'Taylor Lautner . and Rob [Pattinson] were on This Morning when Breaking Dawn came out and . he [Lautner] commented on my tattoos,' adds Cathy. And . Lautner isn't alone in his appreciation of Cathy's tattoo tribute. At a . convention last year, she met MyAnna Buring who plays Tanya, a member . of the Denali coven who come to the Cullen's aid during a confrontation . with the Volturi. 'I've not . met any of the main characters,' explains Cathy, 'but I have met Tanya . (Buring), Seth (Booboo Stewart) and the guy who plays Jared (Bronson . Pelletier).

"Dentists have been warned not to buy a hand held X-ray machine which exposes patients to 10 times the recommended dose of radiation. The cheap imported devices could also pose a significant risk to dentists and dental nurses, health officials said. The Tianjie Dental Falcon scanners can be purchased on eBay for as little as £205, compared with around £4,000 for a safe model. Scroll down for video . The Tianjie Dental Falcon scanners are not approved and not safe for dentists or patients . It is produced by Zhengzhou Tianjie Electronic Equipment Co in China. Officials have confirmed that one UK-based dental practice purchased one of the dangerous machines, and “several” others have expressed interest in buying one. Any dental practices that have purchased the machines have been urged to contact the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Bruce Petrie, of the MHRA’s medical devices enforcement team, said: 'It’s vital that dentists and dental staff do not buy these dental X-ray machines from eBay or other websites because they are not approved and not safe for dentists or patients. 'We have seized 13 of these X-ray machines from the distributor and we are working with eBay and other governments to ensure dentists and patients are protected. We urge anyone who has bought one of these machines to contact us.'

What a typical dental X-ray should look like - cheap imported devices could expose patients to 10 times suggested levels of radiation . Clinical evaluator Donald Emerton, who examined the seized devices at King’s College Hospital, added: 'When we tested the X-ray machine, we found it did not properly protect either a potential patient, nor the person operating it. 'Over time someone operating this machine, such as a dental assistant, would be exposed to unacceptable levels of accumulated radiation and this would have an increased risk to their health. I certainly wouldn’t want someone to use this piece of equipment to take an X-ray of me.' Barry Cockcroft, chief dental officer . for England and the Government’s principal dental adviser, added: 'It . is vitally important that when buying equipment, dentists make sure it . is appropriate and safe for use.

"An audience member at Saturday's Las Vegas Cirque du Soleil show has described the horrific moment she watched the acrobat plunge 50 feet to her death, hearing her screams as she fell. Paris-born mother-of-two Sarah Guyard-Guillot, 31, was pronounced dead late Saturday night after she slipped free from her safety wire during the performance of 'Ka' at the MGM Grand. Aryan Rahmat described the tragic moment to the Today show: 'It went from just watching the show and it being normal to watching someone fall to their death. 'Somehow the rope or the harness that was holding her up, I don't know if it broke or what happened. 'I heard her screaming on the way down.' Scroll down for video . Devastated: Sarah Guyard-Guillot was pronounced dead after slipping from her safety harness during the show . Tragedy: Sarah Guyard-Guillot fell about 50ft during Cirque du Soleil's 'Ka' Heartbreak: Guyard, a mother of two, had more than 22 years' experience as an acrobat . Witness: Aryan Rahmat, who was in the audience, says she could hear screams as the performer fell to her death . Other witnesses said she was being hoisted up the side of the 'vertical' stage when she slipped and plummeted into an open pit below. Visitor Dan Mosqueda of Colorado Springs, who was watching the show, called Ka, at the MGM Grand, told the Las Vegas Sun: 'Initially, a lot of people in the audience thought it was part of the [show]. 'But you could hear screaming, then groaning, and we could hear a female artist crying from the stage.' The show momentarily continued, then stopped. It has been cancelled until further notice. Minutes after the accident, a . recorded announcement informed audience members that refunds or vouchers . to future shows would be offered, and the crowd was dismissed. Cirque du Soleil founder Guy . Laliberte issued a statement yesterday praising Ms Guyard-Guillot and . saying performances of KA have been cancelled until further notice. Ms Guyard-Guillot had been with the original cast of KA since 2006, and had been an acrobatic performer for more than 20 years. Shock: One visitor says Guyard (pictured left during a separate performance and practising, right) was being hoisted up the stage when she slipped free of her safety wire and plummeted to an open pit below . 'I am heartbroken. I wish to extend my sincerest sympathies to the family. We are all completely devastated,' Mr Laliberte said. 'We are reminded with great humility . and respect how extraordinary our artists are each and every night. Our . focus now is to support each other as a family.' Ms Guyard-Guillot also  worked as a coach with Cirquefit, a children’s fitness and circus program in Las Vegas. Parents of some of her students left messages on the group's Facebook page paying tribute their teacher. ‘We will miss her terribly! She was an amazing teacher!’ wrote one parent. ‘No words. My boys loved every moment in Miss Sarah's class. Deepest sympathies to her loved ones,’ another parent wrote.

'The thoughts and prayers of our . employees are with the performer's family, the cast of KA, and the . entire Cirque family during this difficult time.' The accident occurred while Cirque's . top executives, including president Daniel Lamarre, were in Las Vegas to . celebrate the premiere of Michael Jackson One at Mandalay Bay. Ms Guyard-Guillot, nicknamed ‘Sassoon,’ was part . of the original cast of ‘Ka,’ the long-running Cirque du Soleil show at . the MGM Grand hotel and casino. This was the first reported death in the acrobatic company's 30-year history. On Wednesday night, a performer in a . preview performance of that show suffered a mild concussion after . missing the protective pad below an act and landing on the stage. That artist is expected to return to the show. Cirque du Soleil is a Canadian entertainment company based in Montreal, Quebec, self-described as a ‘dramatic mix of circus arts and street entertainment.’ The company was founded in 1984 after its initial members began touring Quebec as a performing troupe four years prior. Cirque du Soleil expanded rapidly through the 1990s and 2000s, growing from one single show in Canada to shows in over 271 cities on every continent except Antarctica. Each show employs approximately 4,000 people from over 40 countries, while the company generates estimated annual revenue of more than $810 million. Each Cirque du Soleil show is a synthesis of circus styles from around the world containing its own central theme and storyline.","Sarah Guyard-Guillot was hoisted up the side of the stage before she slipped .

"Will Tottenham Hotspur vs Chelsea at White Hart Lane on New Year's Day be another to add to the list of classic London derbies? Time will tell.

But can Chelsea brag that they are the kings of the London derby? Scroll down to find out which club are the champions of the capital. VIDEO Scroll down to watch a video preview of Tottenham Hotspur vs Chelsea . There have been a few to recall involving Jose Mourinho (right) including this incident with Arsene Wenger (left) Mourinho and Wenger clashed during a feisty London derby between Chelsea and Arsenal in October . Fourth official Jonathan Moss (centre) keeps Mourinho and Wenger apart during the Premier League match . Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham have all played 209 London derbies, though New Year's Day will see the Gunners fall a fixture behind as they travel to Southampton. Their top spot is safe, however, as they are six points ahead of Chelsea in the all-time table, having won 110 of their 209 derbies. Mourinho's club have won 107 of their 209 but can make that 108 on Thursday in north London, where an old rivalry could be reignited between Federico Fazio and Diego Costa. The Tottenham centre back, while with Sevilla, got into a scuffle with Costa while the striker was at Atletico Madrid, resulting in the defender punching the man he was marking in the stomach. Still, if history is anything to go by, Chelsea should beat their London rivals. Tottenham are some way behind in third in the all-time table on 263 points, having won just 66 of their 209 derbies. Down at the bottom, though, it's not good news for Crystal Palace or Queens Park Rangers. They have 52 and 70 points, respectively, though they have played far less London derbies than the rest. The old rivalry between Tottenham defender Federico Fazio and Chelsea striker Diego Costa will be reignited on New Year's Day - here the then Sevilla centre half punches the then Atletico Madrid centre forward (left) Harry Kane (left) has been Tottenham's star, while Alex Song has been a key man for West Ham . In the 2014 table, though, Chelsea come out on top with 25 points. They won eight of their 10 derbies during the calendar year - twice as many as Tottenham managed, who have 14 points. Sandwiched in between is Arsenal who, having won seven of their 10, come out with 22 points. The goal difference is perhaps the most telling. In 2014, Chelsea scored 24 goals and conceded just four in their derbies. Tottenham, on the other hand, scored just 11 and let in 12.

"BT Sport have made an approach to BBC’s Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker to host their Champions League football starting next season. The inquiry about using Lineker in midweek to anchor BT’s marquee sports property will come as a shock to BT’s main football presenter, Jake Humphrey, who was poached from the BBC and is the face of their Premier League coverage. Approach: BT Sport wanted BBC presenter Gary Lineker to host midweek Champions League coverage . However, Lineker turned down the BT offer because terms and conditions couldn’t be agreed. And working for the subscription channel would have meant renegotiating his BBC contract that gives the Corporation exclusivity on Lineker’s services to an UK audience. But Lineker, now established as one of the top TV sports presenters and ranked in the pantheon alongside David Coleman and Des Lynam in the 50th anniversary MOTD documentary to be screened next Friday, also has a Premier League football deal with American network NBC and has done Walkers Crisps commercials for approaching 20 years. Meanwhile, BT are taking a big risk having new pundit Paul Scholes pitchside at Old Trafford before the game against Swansea when fans chanting his name might make it difficult for his short, sharp comments to be heard. Risk: Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes will be pitchside at Old Trafford on Saturday . It didn't go unnoticed between Liverpool and Manchester United players as they queued at an airport departure gate in the United States during pre-season tours that the United 767 jet was a whole lot bigger than the 747 carrying Liverpool. No wonder, when United took 130 personnel to the USA — substantially more even than the top-heavy 88-strong England party at the World Cup. It showed how much the stature of BBC TV football commentators has diminished that the celebrity guests for the first showing of the Match of the Day 50th anniversary documentary included Barry Davies and John Motson, who have a combined age of 145. But the pair are still far more synonymous with MOTD than the current crop of anonymous Beeb football commentators, although Guy Mowbray did feature in the programme. Jacqui Oatley, the first female commentator on Match of the Day, was given the platform to moan about Press comment on her unfortunate debut. But since Oatley rightly decided to concentrate on presenting and reporting on radio, no female has emerged as a genuine football commentator in the way the excellent Alison Mitchell has in cricket. It wouldn't fit in with many sports scientists’ idea of the best post-match recovery meal, but it is understood that Middlesbrough contacted Leeds to request six stone-baked pizzas — three chicken, three vegetarian — to be delivered to the away dressing room at Elland Road straight after Saturday’s Championship game. Gould awaits ECB call . After Lancashire’s drainage debacle at Old Trafford, which won’t help their slim chances of being awarded an Ashes Test in 2019, Surrey chief executive Richard Gould is especially keen that nothing should go wrong at The Oval during the fifth Test. The ground is already assured of another Ashes Test in its staging agreement, but Gould is the current favourite from inside cricket to succeed David Collier as ECB chief executive, although the headhunters are looking outside the game as well. With rather less ballyhoo than their self-celebration — Sky’s pundits were ordered to send out anniversary tweets — at covering 200 England Test matches, Sky have closed down their online Sports News Radio service that was once seen as a long-term competitor to Radio 5 Live and talkSPORT. A Sky spokesman said: ‘Customers’ habits evolve over time and a standalone sports radio service is sadly no longer viable. We are in the process of consulting with affected staff.’ And Sky’s multi-million-pound experiment with 3D football is heading straight for the knacker’s yard as well.","Match of the Day presenter Lineker turned down offer because terms and conditions couldn't be agreed .

"A married professor at the US Naval War College in Rhode Island who allegedly took a racy photo of his penis that was then posted online has been placed on leave. A May text message conversation with the photo and professor John Schindler's name atop it was circulated on Twitter early Monday. Schindler, who is Professor of National Security Affairs at the college, allegedly captioned the photo of his penis 'Got this?' Suggestive: Professor John Schindler allegedly sent these messages, along with a photo of his penis, to another Twitter user called Lesley . Teacher: Schindler is Professor of National Security Affairs at the US Naval War College . 'Oh dear... :)' the recipient of the sexual snap allegedly said. Schindler then allegedly wrote 'Now ya got it...' The image, along with a screenshot of an email allegedly written by Schindler, were uploaded as part of a series by Twitter user @T3H_ARCH3R, Gawker reports, who claimed the messages were between the professor and another Twitter user. When a Huffington Post reporter reached out, @T3H_ARCH3R wrote 'im sorry sir. I merely posted. Any questions should only be directed to @Currahee88.' @Currahee88's Twitter account no longer exists. In the email allegedly written by Schindler, he looks forward to meeting his recipient, whom he calls a 'vixen,' and claims he is in a non-traditional marriage. 'Kisses, J': Schindler allegedly wrote this letter in which he writes about looking forward to meeting Lesley, who he calls a 'vixen' 'I am married to a very kind and understanding woman, but it's not a marriage in a 'normal' or conventional sense; I won't say more than that now, though I will add that she's...not poor,' he allegedly wrote. Later on, the letter reads 'Suffice it to say I find you immensely engaging and enticing - you occupy my thoughts more than I easily admit, you vixen - and I have no doubt that any meeting in the flesh would be hours of deep talk and more that I would probably not be able to contain my excitement over easily, if at all.' A blogger sent a complaint to the War College's administration - and the college's president, Rear Adm. Walter E. 'Ted' Carter Jr., has ordered an investigation. A college spokeswoman said investigators would look into whether the photo could have been falsified. Saying goodbye: Schindler's first sign-off is seen here . Updated: Schindler's goodbye was changed to include much shorter text . Schindler refused to discuss the photo by telephone on Monday, citing legal reasons. He has deleted his Twitter account. Schindler has been critical of leaker Edward Snowden and others and frequently engages in heated exchanges with critics on Twitter. On his website, he wrote on Monday that he has been subjected to 'nearly non-stop online harassment and stalking' for the past year and 'things have now taken an ugly, indeed sordid turn.' That post was later replaced with a much shorter statement, telling supporters he is taking a break from social media because of personal issues. Schindler has taught at the college since 2005. He also is a fellow at Boston University, according to its website. His resume says he was a senior intelligence analyst with the NSA from 1996 to 2004. The Newport, Rhode Island, college said in a statement it could not comment further to protect the integrity of the investigation. It did not say how long the investigation would take.","Professor John Schindler at the US Naval War College in Rhode Island allegedly took a photo of his penis and sent it, along with the caption 'Got this?'

"The United States cannot solve Iraq's problems with military force, President Barack Obama reiterated in a series of interviews taped on Friday that aired across several networks on Monday morning. Only Iraqis can resolve the violent conflict tearing apart in their country, Obama said, and in order to do accomplish this, they must find a way to ignore their sectarian differences for the common good of their homeland. 'If they can't, there's not gonna . be a military solution to this problem, Obama told CNN's Kate Boulduan. 'There's no amount of American . fire power that's gonna be able to hold the country together, and I've . made that clear to [Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki] and all the other leadership inside of . Iraq.' The U.S. can't go in and occupy every country in the Middle East facing turmoil, president Obama said in a series of interviews that aired on Monday morning . ¿Unless we are prepared to stay indefinitely in all these various countries, something that we can¿t afford, and it would involve over time accusations that we were occupying these countries,¿ Obama told Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski, ¿at some stage, they¿re gonna have to take responsibility for working together' The U.S. neither has the resources nor the responsibility to be the world police in the Middle East, President Barack Obama emphasized in the interviews. ‘Unless . we are prepared to stay indefinitely in all these various countries, . something that we can’t afford, and it would involve over time . accusations that we were occupying these countries,’ Obama told Morning Joe . co-host Mika Brzezinski,‘at . some stage, they’re gonna have to take responsibility for working . together.’ America's military cannot run around the world playing 'whack-a-mole' with extremist . groups, the president has repeatedly said throughout the last several . days. ‘Keep in mind that our goal in . Afghanistan was to decapitate Al Qaeda, which had carried out 9/11. That . has been accomplished. Now Afghanistan is a sovereign country that is . gonna have to deal with its own security,’ Last month the president announced that he would significantly draw down troops in Afghanistan by the end of the year. The president has made clear that he would not put boots back on the ground in Iraq. On Thursday Obama announced that the U.S. would deploy up to 300 military advisors to help train, advise and support the Iraqi army but made clear that the forces would not engage in combat with the Islamic radicals violently attempting to conquer the country. Obama also dispatched Secretary of State John Kerry to the region to meet with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and other foreign leaders. The two met for roughly two hours this morning in Baghdad, and Kerry said afterward the meeting was productive. According to the Associated Press, Iraqi officials familiar with the meeting said Maliki again asked the U.S. to launch air strikes against ISIL, and, once again, he was rebuffed. Kerry reportedly cited civilian casualties as an area of concern. President Obama has been credited with making similar remarks last week to members of Congress asking about air strikes. Oceans apart: Secretary of State John Kerry and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki met face to face in Baghdad on Monday. The two government officials didn't appear to be on very friendly terms at a photo-op, but Kerry said the 100 minute meeting went well . Kerry, center left, flew to Baghdad this morning to meet with Maliki, right, and Iraq's other leaders to personally urge the Shiite-led government to give more power to political opponents before a Sunni insurgency seizes more control across the country and sweeps away hopes for lasting peace . The discussion between the two government officials was not expected to be friendly, given that Washington lawmakers have floated suggestions that the Iraqi premier should resign as a necessary first step toward quelling the vicious uprising. Nor . will it likely bring any immediate, tangible results, as Maliki has . shown no sign of leaving, and Iraqi officials have long listened to — but . ultimately ignored — U.S. advice to avoid appearing controlled by the . decade-old specter of an American occupation in Baghdad. Still, . having suffered together through more than eight years of war — which . killed nearly 4,500 American troops and more than 100,000 Iraqis — the . two wary allies are unwilling to turn away from the very real prospect . of the Mideast nation falling into a fresh bout of sectarian strife. 'The support will be intense, sustained, and if Iraq's leaders take the . steps needed to bring the country together it will be effective,' Kerry said after the meeting. Kerry also met with influential Shiite cleric Ammar al-Hakim, who . heads a leading rival Shiite political party; Parliament Speaker Osama . al-Nujaifi, one of Iraq's highest-ranking Sunnis; and Foreign Minister . Hoshyar Zebari, a  Kurd. Kerry, center, greets the crew as he boards a plane at Jordan's Queen Alia International Airport in Amman this morning . A general view from a helicopter carrying Secretary of State John Kerry, shows Baghdad, Iraq as of this morning. Islamic extremists have still been unable to get close to the country's capitol city despite destroying neighboring towns . Even before U.S. troops left Iraq for good at the end of 2011, a merciless Sunni insurgency was pounding the country with car bombs, roadside explosions, suicide bombings and drive-by assassinations, mainly targeting the Shiite government, its security forces and Shiite pilgrims. Since the start of this year, and peaking this month, ISIL has overtaken several cities in Iraq's west and north, and over the past weekend was controlling several main border crossings between Iraq and Syria. The three-year civil war in Syria — where Sunni rebels are fighting to overthrow President Bashar Assad, whose Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shiism — emboldened Iraqi insurgents who regularly traverse the porous border to gain recruits, funding and weapons, and battlefield confidence. Years of political instability in Baghdad fueled anger against the Shiite-led government from Sunnis who felt powerless and saw their leaders targeted by al-Maliki's security forces. A senior State Department official told the Associated Press the insurgents' recent march on Baghdad has been slowed, although concerns remain that ISIL will attack the golden-domed Shiite shrine to the Imam al-Askari in Samarra. That city, in Sunni territory in north-central Iraq, was the site of a 2006 bombing that triggered the worst of the war's sectarian fighting. Last week, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid declared that Iraq is currently in a civil war. Iraq is the third stop on Kerry's trip to the Middle East. The Secretary of State, center, his staff and bodyguards are pictured here boarding a plane in Jordan this morning . Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, second right, greets Kerry, left, upon his arrival to Baghdad . Kerry's meeting in Baghdad today comes after an announcement by President Barack Obama on Thursday that the U.S. would send up to 300 military advisers to Iraq but no combat troops . The official, who spoke to AP before Kerry's meeting, said the secretary of state would not ask Maliki to resign, as some in the U.S. and Sunni Arab states in Mideast have demanded, because 'it's not up to us.' However, Kerry was expected to urge al-Maliki to quickly create a new government that is far more sensitive to Sunni and Kurdish demands for jobs, power and a fair legal system. Currently, Baghdad is operating under a lame-duck government, as a new parliament that was elected in April has not yet selected its Cabinet ministers. It took more than nine months to seat a new government the last time Iraq underwent the process, in 2010. This time around, the State Department official said, Maliki and other Iraqi officials cannot risk exacerbating the political instability, and further inflaming the insurgency, by stalling a new and more inclusive government. Both President Barack Obama and Iraq's top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, also have urged Maliki to quickly form an inclusive government that promotes the interests of all of Iraq's ethnic and religious groups. The State Department official briefed reporters on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to be named in discussing the negotiations. He described al-Maliki and other Iraqi officials as anxious about what, if any, additional help the U.S. might provide to help curb ISIL after Obama this week said he would send about 300 special forces troops to Baghdad to advise and train local security forces. Obama did not rule out the possibility of also launching airstrikes against the insurgents, but that is not expected anytime soon, if ever, and he has adamantly said he will not send combat forces back to Iraq. Kerry greets U.S. Marines as he arrives at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad .

This is according to tree ring samples found in an ancient Egyptian coffin (pictured) which reveal this ancient world came to its knees following changes to its food resources . The latest study looked at samples taken from the Ipi-ha-ishutef Egyptian coffin alongside wood from funeral boats buried near the pyramid of Sesostris III. ‘The tree rings show the kind of rapid climate change that we and policymakers fear,’ said Professor Stuart Manning from Cornell University. ‘This record shows that climate change doesn’t have to be as catastrophic as an Ice Age to wreak havoc'. Researchers at Cornell University in New York used a technique called ‘dendro radiocarbon wiggle matching,’ to precisely date the items – plus or minus around 10 years.

This is the coffin from which the tree ring samples were taken. The samples showed a small, unusual anomaly following the year 2200 B.C. Paleoclimate research has suggested a major short-term arid event about this time . From the building of vast pyramids to religious life and burial practices, life in ancient Egypt was very different to our own. But modern vegetarians may have more in common than they thought with the ancient Egyptians, because it is thought that they also ate a diet composed largely of vegetables, fruit, wheat and barley. Archaeologists have thought for a while that most settled ancient populations survived on a vegetarian diet and now carbon isotope analysis has given experts a better idea than ever before of what the ancient Egyptians ate. A team of researchers from the University of Lyon studied carbon atoms in 45 mummies of people that lived in Egypt between 3,500BC and 600AD. They found that they ate a lot of barley and wheat over the long period. The finding also echoes many paintings in Egyptian tombs that show people working the land and harvesting wheat to make loaves of bread, which are often offered to god of the afterlife, Osiris. The technique calibrates radiocarbon isotopes found in the sample tree rings with patterns known from other places in the world that have already identified chronologies. The samples showed a small, unusual anomaly following the year 2200 B.C. Paleoclimate research has suggested a possible short-term drought event about this time. ‘This radiocarbon anomaly would be explained by a change in growing season, that is, climate, dating to exactly this arid period of time,’ said Professor Manning from. ‘We’re showing that radiocarbon and these archaeological objects can confirm and in some ways better date a key climate episode.’ That climate episode, said Professor Manning, had major political implications. There was just enough change in the climate to upset food resources and other infrastructure, which is likely what led to the collapse of the Akkadian Empire and affected the Old Kingdom of Egypt and a number of other civilisations. ‘We’re in exactly the same situation as the Akkadians: If something suddenly undid the standard food production model in large areas of the U.S. it would be a disaster,’ he said. Tree rings from the coffin were analysed alongside wooden boats buried near the pyramid of Sesostris III . Climate change, said Professor Manning, had major political implications.

"The search for a cure for dementia is being hampered by ‘funding fatigue’, a major report warns. Donors and drug firms are becoming more ‘conservative’ following a string of ‘repeated and costly failures’, said the report by the dementia forum of the World Innovation Summit for Health (Wish). Just three drugs for Alzheimer’s gained approval between 1998 and 2012 and without a major breakthrough dementia will become a ‘global economic crisis’, it says. The search for a cure for dementia is being hampered by ‘funding fatigue’, a major report warns (file picture) The report highlighted new sources of funding including private investment from industry. The move was welcomed by British charities including Alzheimer’s Research UK. Dr James Pickett, of the Alzheimer’s Society, called for a ‘massive step change’ in research funding. More than 100 potential drugs for Alzheimer’s disease failed to live up to initial promise between 1998 and 2012, the report says. Just three drugs gained approval for treating the symptoms of the disease during that time - it has been 12 years since the last treatment was licensed in the UK. The report claims a succession of ‘repeated and costly failures’ have created ‘funding fatigue’ among donors and drug manufacturers. Major drug companies halved the number of research programmes into central nervous system disorders, which includes dementia, between 2009 and 2014, the report said. Experts said that with no known cure and a huge increase in cases expected within a decade, ‘a massive step change in research funding’ was needed. Dementia research has been relatively neglected for research funding compared with other major diseases such as cancer. The report was presented at Wish 2015, a gathering of health experts in Doha, Qatar. Wish is an initiative of the Qatar Foundation, the charitable organisation linked to the Gulf state’s ruling al-Thani family. Major drug companies halved the number of research programmes into central nervous system disorders, which includes dementia, between 2009 and 2014 . Its executive chair is the former Labour health minister Lord Darzi who said the social and economic burden of dementia was already clear. He said ‘Yet the future costs to societies and economies will be enormous without significant intervention now.’ The Wish report says there has been speculation among experts that ‘repeated and costly failures in drug development have created funding fatigue in donors and pharmaceutical companies. ‘They believe this has caused the field to become more conservative, and limited unconventional strategies and parallel drug discovery opportunities.’ The report sets out a range of potential new funding options for dementia research, including attracting private investment from industry and high net worth individuals. Dementia affects over 830,000 people in the UK and costs the UK economy £23bn a year. Alzheimer’s Research UK, the world’s largest dedicated dementia research charity, earlier this week announced a £30m Drug Discovery Alliance to buck the trend by using academic resources. It has launched three flagship Drug Discovery Institutes at the Universities of Cambridge, Oxford and UCL (University College London). The Drug Discovery Institutes will see 90 new research scientists employed in state-of-the-art facilities to fast-track the development of new treatments for Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. Hilary Evans, Director of External Affairs at Alzheimer’s Research UK, the UK’s leading dementia research charity, said the number affected by dementia in the UK is expected to exceed 1 million by 2025. ‘Yet we currently lack treatments capable of tackling the diseases that cause it. ‘If we are to find ways of tackling diseases like Alzheimer’s and transform people’s lives, we must work together, increase investment and galvanise research efforts’ she said. Dr Pickett added said: ‘With no known cure, limited treatments, and a projected prevalence of one million within the decade, we need a massive step change in research funding in order to develop new treatments.’ He said that public-private partnerships designed to share the risk of investment had potential for future funding of research. The UK Government has taken a leading role in the global fight against dementia. London hosted the world’s first Dementia Summit in 2013, where the Prime Minister pledged to double the country’s research funding for dementia to £66m in 2015.","Search for dementia cure being hit by ‘funding fatigue’, major report warns .

"Roy Hodgson has assured Jack Wilshere he will be in England’s World Cup squad even if he does not play again for Arsenal this season. The England manager, who will be without Andros Townsend after Tottenham confirmed the winger needs surgery on his left ankle, has confirmed he will take Wilshere to Brazil. Hodgson insists he is picking his squad on the basis of their performances over the past two years in qualification and is unlikely to spring surprises. On the plane: Jack Wilshere suffered a hairline fracture in his left foot after this challenge with Denmark's Daniel Agger in March . He said: ‘Wilshere has been training with the others at Arsenal and, while he is not being thrown back into the fray, he is there. He has been training with the team, as far as I know, for a while.’ Wilshere has not played since aggravating a foot injury during England’s 1-0 friendly win over Denmark on March 5 at Wembley.The Arsenal midfielder has started training again, but Arsene Wenger is refusing to rush him back into action after more than two months on the sidelines. Hodgson said: ‘I am not prepared to have a 100 per cent rule that you either play in the last game of the season or you don’t go — I am not prepared to do that. ‘I have spoken to Arsene and they have been holding him back because they don’t want to push him too early.’ Hodgson has a number of other injury concerns ahead of the World Cup, but he claims to know his  23-man squad. Southampton attacker Jay Rodriguez would have been in Hodgson’s squad but he has been ruled out with an anterior cruciate ligament injury and Townsend is also out of contention. Ruled out: Andros Townsend was inspirational in getting England to Brazil, but will miss the World Cup . ANDROS TOWNSEND, Tottenham, 5 capsSet to have surgery after ankle ligament damage against Stoke last Saturday ended his season. THEO WALCOTT, Arsenal, 36 capsRuled out of the World Cup in January when he damaged his cruciate ligament in an FA Cup victory over Tottenham.JAY RODRIGUEZ, Southampton, 1 capWorld Cup dream was shattered at the beginning of April after rupturing his cruciate ligament against Manchester City. READY TO STEP UP... Raheem Sterling, Liverpool, 2 capsThe in-form winger with three goals in his last three games. Playing a huge role in Liverpool’s title tilt. James Milner, Manchester City, 45 capsOften preferred by Roy Hodgson to bring a defensive balance to the midfield and has been a consistent performer for City this season. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Arsenal, 14 capsHas occupied a more central role for Arsene Wenger but will still be an option out wide once he has fully recovered from a groin injury. Tottenham full back Kyle Walker has a niggling pelvic injury, while Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (groin) and Phil Jagielka (hamstring) are concerns. But Hodgson is optimistic. ‘My decisions will be based on the information I get from clubs’ managers and medical staff. I’m rather hoping we go with everyone basically fit,’ he said. ‘Kyle is a bit more of a difficult one because it is a long time since he has been fit. We are still monitoring the situation and we haven’t been told for certain that he will be out for the next six weeks but we’re concerned it has been a long time. ‘He has not been able to do any training and I know he has had another injection. We are waiting to find out about that.’ Townsend left Stoke last Saturday wearing a protective boot after he had come on for 12 minutes of Tottenham’s 1-0 win. He will have surgery on his ankle today after the results of an MRI scan confirmed serious ligament damage. The 22-year-old will require a 10-week recovery period. Townsend looked a certainty to go to the World Cup after making an explosive impact for England in their final two qualifiers against Montenegro and Poland which clinched their place in Brazil. But a loss of form saw him lose his place in the Spurs starting XI, while the emergence of Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling and Southampton’s Adam Lallana had put further pressure on his squad place. Bright young thing: Raheem Sterling has dazzled for Liverpool this season and looks a shoo-in for Brazil . Hodgson said: ‘I am very disappointed for him in particular. He had a fantastic debut bursting on to the scene and he did really well. ‘I have been a bit disappointed that he has not had as much playing time over recent months. To see him ruled out like this with a serious ankle injury is a cruel blow. ‘My thoughts are very much with him and the only thing I can say is that he is young and there will be lots of other opportunities.’ On the comeback trail: Phil Jagielka (right) returns for Everton this weekend . Jagielka’s World Cup chances could improve this weekend as he prepares to return for Everton in their Barclays Premier League clash with Manchester City. Hodgson added: ‘We have had good reports back for the last few weeks. He has had a problem but he has been participating to a decent level in training. They have been keen not to throw him back in but we don’t have any fears. He might be back in on Saturday.’","Jack Wilshere will be in Roy Hodgson's 23-man squad for Brazil .

"A 33-stone man who was so depressed about being overweight that he tried to end his own life has lost a staggering 18 stone - and so dramatic is his transformation that he is now nicknamed Mr Muscles. Mike Waudby, 31, has also found a beautiful blonde girlfriend, Morgan, who he has been dating for about a year and a half. Interestingly, Mike says: 'What attracted me to her at the start is that she mentioned she hates people who judge others based on their appearance.' Scroll down for video . Lost control: Mike weighed so much that he lived his life slumped in a chair drinking alcohol he ordered off the internet . Toned: The personal trainer from Hull, Yorks lost 18 stone over 18 months and is now nicknamed Mr Muscles . Hiding from the world in his bedroom, . Mike would order alcohol online and have it delivered to his home, . wasting his days watching television and browsing the internet. Speaking to Mail Online Mike says that his diet was never excessive. 'I live at home and I'd generally have cereal for breakfast, a sandwich for lunch and then whatever my mum cooked for dinner. 'The weight gain came from the alcohol. I would drink an entire bottle of whisky and about six cans of lager every night. 'If I ran out of whisky I could drink up to 18 cans of lager, so I was consuming about 3,000 calories in alcohol every day. Mike Waudby weighed 22 stone by the age of 21 and by the time he was 29 he tipped the scales at 33 stone. Morbidly obese Mike became so down about his weight that he took an overdose to end his suffering. But surviving the suicide attempt proved to be a turning point for Mike, from Hull East Yorks, who has since lost over half his bodyweight. Before and after: Left, Mike was once asked to . leave a bar by a group of girls who cruelly told him he was making them . 'feel sick'. Right, Mike is now fighting fit and says he's been given a . 'new lease of life' Incredible . progress: Mike charted his weight loss and subsequent muscle gain on . Facebook - but says he is still insecure about loose skin around his . hips . 'That was the last time I went out in public, apart from going to the doctor, for seven years.' Now a personal trainer and nicknamed Mr Muscles, Mike, 31, is urging others not to get into the same situation he found himself in. He said: 'By the age of 21, I weighed 22 stone. I used to go out but, one night, a girl came up to me and asked me to leave the bar I was in. I asked why and she told me I was making her and her friends feel sick. 'I'd also end up eating sandwiches or about four slices of white bread late at night as the drinking made me hungry.' Though Mike previously had several jobs including car valeting and as a supermarket security guard his increasing weight soon meant he was unable to work and he became increasingly isolated. He said: 'One night, while listening to Guns N’ Roses, I thought to myself, ""What kind of a life is this?"" 'I . had terrible pains but I was too scared to go to the gym and do . anything about my weight, as people pointed and laughed at me in the . street. 'I thought, ""stuff it"", and drank two bottles of whisky, eight cans of Stella and as many tablets as I could find. 'I remember waking up, no headache, no pains, just a sickening feeling that I was still here and not dead.' Then, one night, reality set in for Mike and he decided it was time to take control of his life. 'I had wasted everything and lost everything and the only person who could do something about it was me,' he said. Mike, now 13 stone with a muscular physique, initially lost weight using just a cross-trainer in his room . Mike ordered a cross-trainer on the internet, set it up in his room and set to work. He gradually built up his stamina to three one-hour sessions a day and stopped drinking altogether. Mike said: 'Every session on the . cross-trainer ended up with me taking my XXXXL dripping wet T-shirt off . and just looking down at my belly crying. But, each time, I picked . myself up and carried on.' It took 18 months for Mike, now 31, to lose 18 stone. But he was still left with a major problem – his loose skin. 'I felt just as disgusting as I did . when I weighed 33 stone. I needed to do something, and I ended up paying . for skin on my stomach and upper arms to be removed.' The operation removed some of the excess skin but Mike was not satisfied with the end result. It is little wonder that Mike has now earned the nickname Mr Muscles . Mike decided to join a gym to tone up properly - and enjoyed working out so much he strove to make it his career. Demonstrating his new found body confidence Mike has shared his progress on his Facebook page, posting a series of pictures of himself throughout his dramatic weight loss alongside the caption ‘Trained my f****** ass off!’. In response to the highly complimentary comments Mike says that he feels he still has some way to go in honing his physique. ‘Well done doesn't seem to cut it. One hell of an accomplishment,’ one message read. Mike responded: ‘Thanks everyone, really appreciate the kind words. ‘Have a long way to go yet, gotta (sic) pack on more muscle to fill that skin. Just gonna (sic) take time and effort. Need my head in the right place to finish the fight.’ Mike also has posted images of his new healthy lifestyle with pictures of high-protein snacks and bread as well as himself hard at work in the gym. 'I try and consume about 250g of protein a day now and eat only what you would describe as clean food,' Mike told MailOnline. 'I do treat myself to the occasional take away and a couple of beers at the weekends but I never get drunk anymore.' he says. Despite his amazing transformation, Mike admits he still has insecurities. He says: 'My loose skin still really affects me, especially around my hips. It makes me very nervous and paranoid. 'When I run and jump I can feel moving and it feels likes flab to me. 'I always feel people are staring at it. 'I think I look better with my clothes on as then you can't see the skin, though people say they don’t notice it. 'I do get disappointed I can’t be like everyone who trains as hard as me, but you just have to get on with it.' Now Mike, who says he is still getting used to his new body shape, has qualified as a personal trainer and is looking for his first clients. 'Losing weight has not only given me a new lease of life, it has actually given me a life,' he said.","Mike weighed 22st aged 21 and tipped the scales at 33st when he was 29 .

"Cardinal Keith O'Brien has resigned as Archbishop of St Andrew's and Edinburgh over the allegations. One of his accusers says the church would 'crush' him, given the opportunity . Church leaders are debating whether to allow Britain’s most senior Roman Catholic clergyman to take part in the vote to choose a new pope after he was accused of ‘inappropriate behaviour’ towards young priests 30 years ago. Vatican officials last night admitted they were aware of the accusations against Cardinal Keith O’Brien and that the final decision was ‘in the Pope’s hands’. Cardinal O’Brien, head of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland and Britain’s only representative at the election of  the next Pope, missed a morning Mass in Edinburgh at which he was due to celebrate the Pope’s eight-year tenure. He denies all the allegations. It is understood the complaints by  three serving priests and a former priest were reported to the Vatican through the papal ambassador to Britain a week before the Pope’s announcement that he was to step down. The complainants – all associated with the Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh – are said to have told Apostolic Nuncio Antonio Mennini they want Cardinal O’Brien to resign before next month’s conclave to pick a new pontiff. The 74-year-old, who is due to retire next month, will be the only British churchman eligible to vote. The former priest claims the cardinal made an inappropriate approach to him in 1980 after night prayers, when he was a seminarian at St Andrew’s College in Drygrange, Roxburghshire, where the cardinal was spiritual director. The complainant, who is now married, is reported to have said he gave up the priesthood when Cardinal O’Brien was first made a bishop. He said: ‘I knew then he would always have power over me. It was assumed I left the priesthood to get married. I did not. I left to preserve my integrity.’ Scroll down for video . Saying mass in Edinburgh: Cardinal Keith O' Brien in his role as Britain's most senior Catholic . In March 2012 O'Brien wrote of his concerns over same-sex marriage in Scotland in The Daily Telegraph. He said the proposal represents a 'grotesque subversion of a universally accepted human right'. 'Same-sex marriage would eliminate entirely in law the basic idea of a mother and a father for every child,' he added. 'It would create a society which deliberately chooses to deprive a child of either a mother or a father.' He also opposed the introduction of civil partnerships, saying he believes that 'such relationships are harmful to the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of those involved'. After he was awarded the 'Bigot of the Year' award, Stonewall Scotland director Colin Macfarlane said: 'In the past year the cardinal has likened the campaign for same-sex marriage to slavery, he has called it grotesque.' The second complainant is reported to . have said he was living in a parish when he was visited by Cardinal . O’Brien, and ‘inappropriate contact’ took place. The third complainant is said to have . alleged ‘unwanted behaviour’ by the cardinal in the 1980s after they . shared a late-night drinking session. And the fourth reportedly claims the cardinal used night prayers as an excuse for inappropriate contact. Cardinal O’Brien was supported yesterday by Cormac Murphy-O’Connor, a former Archbishop of Westminster. Cardinal Murphy-O’Connor said: ‘I was . obviously very sad, but the cardinal has denied the allegations, so I . think we will just have to see how that pans out.’ Asked whether or not Cardinal O’Brien . should be able to take part in the selection of the new Pope, he added: . ‘The allegations have not been proved so he will have to decide whether . he wants to go.’ Allegations against members of the Church have dogged . the papacy of Benedict XVI and some in the Vatican believe the endless . scandals prompted him to resign.

"Paranoid president: Putin has every dish inspected by a medically-qualified professional sampler, who makes sure that it is completely safe to eat . The security obsessed Russian president Vladimir Putin has all of his dishes tested for poison, it emerged today. He has every dish inspected by a medically-qualified professional sampler, who makes sure that it is completely safe to eat. The revelation about the 59-year-old former KGB agent was served up by Gilles Bragard, founder of an elite group of chefs who cook for the world’s most powerful men and women. ‘Tasters still exist but only in the Kremlin, where a doctor checks every dish with the chef,’ said Mr Bragard. Speaking in Paris before a meeting of the ‘Club des Chefs des Chefs’ (Chiefs’ Chefs Club), Mr Bragard also revealed that American presidents often liked their food ‘security cleared’ before eating. These included George Bush, who had two former FBI agents taste his every one of his dishes during a trip to London. American leaders are particularly suspicious of non-US food.

"IBM has developed a computer chip which it says will function like a human brain in a giant step forward for artificial intelligence. TrueNorth is being hailed as the world’s first neurosynaptic computer chip because it can figure things out on its own. The chip also has one million ‘neurons’ and could cram the same power as a super computer into a circuit the size of a postage stamp. IBM's TrueNorth processor could enable a wide variety of applications based on the human brain's computing power. For instance, it could help assist vision-impaired people to navigate through an environment . Experts said that it was as big an advance as the advent of supercomputers in the 1980. Horst Simon, deputy director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, told the New York Times: ‘It is a remarkable achievement in terms of scalability and low power consumption’. Modern processors have some 1.4 billion transistors and consume up to 140 watts but the IBM chip contains 5.4 billion transistors and uses just 70 milliwatts of power, meaning it is incredibly efficient. TrueNorth will use closely interconnected ‘neurons’ just like the brain does meaning that it can work proactively to a level not seen before. In addition to the one million ‘neurons’ it has 256 million programmable synapses, the most IBM has ever put in a chip.

The human brain has 100 billion neurons and up to 150 trillion synapses but IBM principal investigator and senior manager Dharmendra Modha told CNET.com that it could still perform a wide variety of tasks. TrueNorth is the world’s first neurosynaptic computer chip because it can figure things out on its own. It has one million ‘neurons’ and could cram the same power as a super computer into a circuit the size of a postage stamp. TrueNorth will use closely interconnected ‘neurons’ just like the brain does meaning that it can work proactively to a level not seen before. In addition to the one million ‘neurons’ it has 256 million programmable synapses, the most IBM has ever put in a chip. He said that TrueNorth could be used to monitor oil spills or issue tsunami alerts on its own without the need for a human to keep track of things. Richard Doherty, the research director of tech research firm Envisioneering Group, said that IBM's chip was a ‘really big deal’. He said that if a robot today was walking towards a pillar then it needed a huge amount of computing to stop it heading into it. But a robot using TrueNorth would be able to sense it and change direction just as a human can. Computers are now approaching the stage where they are considered ‘smarter’ than humans in many ways. Earlier this year a computer programme passed the Turing Test for the first time, which is seen as a milestone in artificial technology. The programme, which mimicked a 13-year-old boy, was mistaken for a human more than 40 per cent of the time during a series of five-minute keyboard conversations with a real person. Films like The Terminator have played on our fears about such technology - in the classic sci-fi thriller a computer system becomes self aware and launches nuclear strikes in an attempt to wipe out humanity, leading to a war between man and machines. Ironically IBM’s cognitive computing programme is called SyNapse, which is similar to Skynet, the computer system in The Terminator.

"A woman has described how she stings herself with bees up to 100 times a week, in large part, for sexual pleasure. In the latest episode of TLC's My Strange Addiction, Margaret, 53, from Morningview, Kentucky, admits that ten stings 'makes sex great'. The couple do not elaborate on this bizarre detail, though Margaret speaks unapologetically about her love of the bee sting sensation. Scroll down for video . Bizarre addiction: Margaret, 53, from Morningview, Kentucky, loves stinging herself with bees and admits that ten stings 'makes sex great' 'I sting myself on my hip, my elbows, on a finger, my ankle, my forehead, on the tip of my nose,' she says on the show. 'The most I've ever given myself was between 15 and 20 in my left hip. I really love stinging myself with bees!' Margaret says she began stinging herself around a decade ago to relieve her arthritis pain.  She now keeps hives in her back garden for a steady supply. Pleasure point: Margaret describes how she likes to sting herself on the tip of her nose . How-to: Holding a bee in a set of tweezers, Margaret describes how she taps the insect's abdomen against herself to make the stinger puncture her skin . '[I heard] people [had] been using it to relieve certain pain symptoms,' she explains. 'The first time that I stung myself, it . didn't hurt as bad as I thought it would,' she recalls. 'And it just got . easier every time.' 'The first time that I stung myself, it . didn't hurt as bad as I thought it would. And it just got . easier every time' Now Margaret indulges herself with around 15 stings a day. Holding a bee in a set of tweezers, she describes how she taps the insect's abdomen against herself to make the stinger puncture her skin. 'There's a couple of trigger points right here that I like to sting,' she says, prodding at the skin around her kneecap. 'I can kind of put a little dent in it with my fingernail.' She says the resulting sensation is 'peppery' and while 'no two stings are alike', she 'feel[s] relief from all of them.' Stinging sensation: Margaret says her elbow is another favorite spot . Unlikely habit: Margaret started stinging herself to relieve arthritis pain over a decade ago . Margaret's husband, JD, admits he is concerned about his wife's dependence on bee stings, though it does not surprise him. 'She's always had kind of a taste for looking at the odd side of things,' he says. 'At this point now, with 15 stings a day, that's when I've started to get really concerned about this.' In the episode of My Strange Addiction, a doctor warns Margaret that her next sting could be fatal as her constant use could cause an allergy to develop. Steady supply: Margaret uses bees from her hives in her back garden . But while Margaret experiences guilt over the bees that have died as a result of the habit, she has been unable to give up - though she has cut back to around ten stings a day. My Strange Addiction documents people who turn to atypical compulsions in order to deal with . their emotional demons. The new season also features a woman who has grown her hair to 21-feet-long, and a 19-year-old girl who is hooked on eating sand.","Margaret, 53, from Morningview, Kentucky, began stinging herself a decade ago to relieve her arthritis pain .

"A Czech woman who gave birth on the bus on her way to work and left the newborn boy on the street to freeze to death has been sentenced to 15 years in prison. Katerina Vastikova, 33, was travelling to her job in a factory in Trinec, a town in the north-eastern Czech Republic, when she went into labour in March. She told police: 'I had pains and spasms on the bus. I realised that I was giving birth to my child, I felt it coming out of me. 'It didn't take long and I left the boy in my trousers until we got to my bus stop.' Heartless: Katerina Vastikova has been jailed for 15 years after giving birth on a bus in the Czech Republic and dumping her baby in a car park where it froze to death while she callously went off to work . Froze to death: The baby died from hypothermia after being left in this car park (in the spot circled above) Nobody on the bus noticed that she had just given birth. Miss Vastikova said that she 'left the bus and didn't know what to do'. She added: 'I put the naked baby on the grass and tore off the umbilical cord. I don't remember if the baby was crying or breathing. Then I went to work.' The temperature outside was around freezing and police said that the newborn died from hypothermia shortly after his birth. Heartless Vastikova said she had then flushed the placenta down the toilet at work. She added: 'I didn't feel well. I was sick but I worked.' The dead baby was found by a passer-by and Vastikova was arrested four days later. Callous: Vastikova said she flushed the placenta down the toilet at work, adding: 'I didn't feel well' Vastikova even kept her pregnancy secret from her mother and the baby's father, Robert Conka (above), who is now demanding compensation of £280,000 for the death of his son . Prosecutor Vit Legersky speaks to the media outside the courtroom after securing the murder conviction . Vastikova has two other children who are being raised by foster parents. In court, she refused to explain why she had abandoned her baby, only saying: 'I don't know why I left him there.' Ostrava Regional court sentenced her to 15 years in prison for murder. Prosecutor Vit Legersky, 39, said: 'She was hiding her pregnancy, she didn't visit her doctor and she wasn't preparing for the baby.' Vastikova kept her pregnancy secret from both her mother and the baby's father, Robert Conka. Conka, 34, said: 'If she had told me I would have taken care of my son. She killed my first baby. 'I'm asking for compensation of 10 million Czech Koruna (£282,000).'","Katerina Vastikova went into labour on bus, but no-one saw her give birth .

"Retail giant Target faces at least five lawsuits related to the massive credit and debit card breach revealed last week. The suits are seeking damages for the roughly 40million credit and debit card accounts that were compromised by hackers. Four states have also asked Target for information while they continue to investigate the lapse. The lawsuits have been filed in California, Minnesota and Oregon, and the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and South Dakota have asked for further information. On notice: Target faces at least five lawsuits across three states for the data breach . At least two lawsuits have been filed in California, two in Minnesota and one in Oregon, CBS News said, citing multiple reports. More than one is seeing class action status, and at least one is seeking compensation in the millions of dollars. The attorneys general of four separate states seeking more information about the coordinated attack is only the first step in what may become a multi-state investigation, according to USA Today. Target’s sales have suffered in the aftermath of the attack, which occurred between November 27 and December 15. Transactions are down as much as four per cent, according to an analyst who spoke with the Wall Street Journal. Figures at other retailers remained strong. Trust broken: Shoppers credit and debit card info was stolen at the point of sale . Target declined to comment to MailOnline on this weekend's sales figures. A spokesperson said via email that the retailer on reports such information on a quarterly basis. The chain announced in a statement Monday afternoon that a conference call will be held with the attorneys general of the states requesting more information in order to better coordinate how to respond going forward. It is also working closely with the Secret Service and the Department of Justice in their ongoing efforts to determine how exactly the identity theft happened. Reports of the lawsuits come as security expert Brian Krebs wrote in his blog that he is seeing credit and debit card information stolen from Target selling on the black market. ‘[They are] selling in batches of one million cards and going for anywhere from $20 to more than $100 per card.’ JP Morgan Chase took the unprecedented step of limiting customers affected by the Target breach to cash withdrawals of only $100 and purchases of only $300 – on the weekend before Christmas. Less transactions: Sales were down as much as four per cent the past weekend at Target stores across the country . ‘This is the worst possible time something like this could happen,’ Craig Johnson, president of Consumer Growth Partners, told the Journal. A shopper told CBS News the troubles forced him to avoid using cards. ‘I actually used cash today specifically because I heard about this and I didn't want to risk using my card.’ The retailer also tried enticing shoppers by discounting final purchase prices 10 per cent in all stores.","The lawsuits have been filed in California, Minnesota and Oregon .

"The man accused of gunning down cinema-goers at a midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises in Colorado has been spitting so much at officers while he is held in police custody, they have been forced to put a face guard on him. After James Holmes was arrested in the movie theater's parking lot, he sat wide-eyed and twitching and refused to cooperate with investigators, sources revealed. It also emerged that when authorities placed evidence bags over the 24-year-old's hands to preserve gunshot residue, he began playing with them as if they were two puppets, the sources told CALL7. He is being held in isolation at the Arapahoe County Jail but the continual spitting has forced authorities to cover his face while he is being moved. Bizarre behavior: James Holmes, pictured at his first court appearance on Monday, was involved with a number of prostitutes in the months before the massacre . It is just the latest example of Holmes' bizarre behaviour and comes as his mother revealed she feared he had . been disturbed for years and was concerned about his social isolation. Arlene Holmes, who lives in San Diego, California and was only made aware of the shootings when a reporter called her for a comment, is said to have urged her son to seek counselling. The claim in the Washington Post about . Mrs Holmes, a nurse, is the first sign that she could have averted the . massacre and raises grave questions over what else she knew. When she was called about the shootings on Friday, she told an ABC reporter 'you have the right person' - in an apparent indication that her son was the likely gunman. But on Monday, her lawyer spoke out to claim Mrs Holmes's statement had been mischaracterised, and she had in fact been confirming that she was the 'right person'. Out of it: Holmes, who said he dyed his hair to appear like Batman's nemesis The Joker, gave an alarming performance in court, but jail workers said he was not on any medication . Pain: Family members gather around the makeshift memorial behind the Century 16 cinema on Tuesday . Mourning: Left, two daughters of victim Gordon Cowden's embrace as another daughter leaves messages on a cross at the memorial site. The father of four, who was the oldest victim, is pictured right . Loss: Two of Cowden's teenage daughters were with him in the cinema at the time of the shooting . Struggle: The family gathers at the cross nearby to the cinema where their father was gunned down. In the foreground, a family portrait shows Cowden and his children . Emotion: Ashley Deuell, 18, kneels next to a cross and family photo of Cowden, a friend of her family . According to reports, the neuroscience . graduate was adopted and Mrs Holmes, 58, and husband Robert, 61, a . software developer, raised him as one of their own. The reports come just one day after . Holmes's startling first appearance in court on Monday, where he rolled . his eyes, stared directly ahead and swayed from side to side. He also displayed a disheveled mop of . orange hair, apparently fading from the red he had dyed it in an . attempt to resemble Batman's arch nemesis, The Joker. He stayed silent throughout the appearance at Arapahoe County Court and at times appeared as if he was under heavy medication. But a jail employee has claimed that the 12-minute catatonic appearance was an act, not the result of any drugs. 'We don’t just hand out meds,' the Arapahoe County Detention Center worker told the New York Daily News. 'It just doesn’t work like that. If he was acting sleepy, he was faking it.' New images: The public is learning more about the victims of the horrific attack, including Petty Officer Third Class John T. Larimer, 27, left, and young dad Jonathan T. Blunk, 26, right . Loved: Well-wishers and friends have left messages on the crosses representing each of the 12 victims . Case: Members of the prosecution team leave the cinema after spending an hour there on Tuesday . Fighter: Robert Blache sits by his daughter Christina, who was shot in the attack, at Swedish Medical Center . Support: Best friends Allie Young, left, and Stephanie Davies recount how Stephanie saved Allie's life by applying pressure to a gun wound on her neck . The source added: 'I heard he’s not cooperating. He’s trying to act crazy. I know the people here believe . it’s an act, but only he knows for sure.' Dr Joan Neff, a criminologist from the . University of Virginia, told MailOnline that Holmes' appearance was . consistent with someone who was suffering from a mental illness, such as . schizophrenia. Mugshot: Holmes, 24, is suspected of shooting dead 12 cinema-goers and wounding 58 others . She said this would also explain why he dropped out of his PhD so abruptly. 'We . know that certain types of psychoses tend to have an onset in the early . 20s; if that's the case he may be in the midst of coping with that. He . may not know what's going on,' she said. Alternatively, . she said the conditions of his jailing - especially for someone who has . never been in trouble with the law - may have brought on an episode. 'Sometimes that can be an experience in and of itself,' Dr Neff said. 'So his appearance is not very surprising.' Jailors at the facility agreed Holmes has been . acting bizarrely ever since arriving and 'thinks he's acting in a . movie', they told the New York Daily News . 'He was spitting at the door and . spitting at the guards,' a released inmate said outside the jail. 'He’s . spitting at everything. Dude was acting crazy.' Mental illness is something the suspected gunman would be educated in, after completing a neuroscience degree before dropping out of his PhD program last month. Holmes was previously awarded a $26,000 federal grant from the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, part of the US Deparment of Health. The sum covered a stipend and his tuition at the University of Colorado in Denver. He was one of six neuroscience students at the school to receive the money, WNEW News reported. As . well as mental illness, there have been other suggestions at a motive, . including reports Holmes had recently split from a girlfriend and the . fact he had been struggling in school before dropping out. Backtrack: Holmes's mother feared he had been disturbed for years. On Monday her attorney Lisa Damiani (pictured) said the woman had no idea he was the suspect, despite earlier reports . Outrage: Tom and Caren Teves, whose son Alex was killed, and his girlfriend Amanda Lindgren, were just a few of the relatives at the court appearance. They branded Holmes a 'coward' Crowd: People, including victims and their relatives, listen to the court hearing of James Holmes on Monday . Ongoing: Crime scene tape is seen around the apartment where Homes lived in Aurora on Tuesday . Investigation: Members of the prosecution also arrive to look at Holmes's apartment . Whatever the . cause, families are now reacting to the killings by unleashing lawsuits . on the Century 16 Theater where the shooting took place, Holmes' doctors and Warner Brothers. TMZ reported that Torrence Brown, Jr. was in the cinema when Holmes shot dead 12 people and wounded another 58. One of his friends, 18-year-old A.J. Boik, was killed in the massacre, and Brown is now suffering from . extreme trauma, according to his attorney Donald Karpel. His lawsuit, . which has not yet been filed, will name the theater, for not properly . securing the emergency exit and Holmes’ doctors, for allegedly . prescribing medications, as defendants. It will also name the studio Warner Brothers, claiming that Dark Knight Rises is too violent. Lawsuit: Witness Torrence Brown, Jr. (right) is about to bring a lawsuit against the cinema, Holmes' doctors and Warner Brothers after suffering extreme trauma after his friend AJ Boik (left) was shot dead . Remembered: A woman grieves at a memorial for victims behind the theater in Aurora, Colorado . Outpouring: Thousands of people continue to visit the makeshift memorial to leave gifts or messages . Never forgotten: The community continues to come together as questions remain about the killer . After his brief appearance on Monday, Holmes is back in solitary confinement - but the families of the victims said they saw enough. 'I saw the coward in court today,' said Tom Teves, whose son Alex was among those killed. 'Alex could have wiped the floor with him without breaking a sweat.' Holmes is being held without bond and will hear the formal charges against him next Monday. The County District Attorney is considering whether to seek the death penalty.

"General Motors Co.'s Chevrolet Impala has been rated the top sedan in the U.S., seizing a spot dominated by Japanese and European models for more than two decades. The redesigned 2014 Impala was not only the top large sedan, with a score of 95 of a possible 100 points, but also among the top-rated vehicles that Consumer Reports has tested, the influential consumer magazine said. The top sedan spot has previously been held 12 times by Japanese models and nine times by European ones since Consumer Reports starting their rating system in 1992. America's top sedan: The 2014 Chevrolet Impala LTZ (pictured) was rated 95 points, out of a possible 100 by Consumer Reports . Only Tesla's Model S hatchback (99 points) and BMW's 135i coupe (97) scored higher than the Impala in this year's report. The ranking by Consumer Reports is the latest symbol of GM's effort to improve consumers' perception of its brands - bringing some good news to the company's hometown Detroit, after the city filed for bankruptcy. The Impala historically was better known for its image as king of the rental cars. 'It just shows that GM is back and they're making really desirable vehicles,' Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports, said in a telephone interview. 'What's really amazing about it is the vehicle in one year went from one of the worst vehicles in its category to the best.' The 2013 Impala scored 63 points in Consumer Reports testing. Fisher said the new Impala's . performance is part of a renaissance by U.S. automakers that includes . such redesigned vehicles as the Chrysler 300 sedan, Ford Escape SUV and . Fusion sedan, and Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV. The Impala's recognition follows GM's performance last month in a widely followed J.D. Power and Associates study. High ranking cars: The Tesla Model S (pictured) was one of the only cars rating higher than the Impala - receiving 99 points out of 100 (but was not in the sedan category . In . that firm's initial quality survey, the Detroit automaker had eight . cars and trucks named best in their segment in the U.S. auto market and . its mainstream Chevy brand jumped 10 spots to No. 5 among 33 brands. The . high rankings for its vehicles is welcome news for a company trying to . put its 2009 bankruptcy and $49.5 billion U.S. taxpayer-funded bailout . behind it. Impala . used to get 70 per cent of its sales from fleet customers, like car . rental companies, and 30 per cent from consumers, but GM officials want . to flip that ratio. The car competes with the Ford Taurus and Toyota Avalon. Consumer . Reports has been testing and reviewing cars for more than 75 years, but . started giving them numerical scores and compiling ratings charts in . only 1992. In that time, the top-scoring sedan spot has been held 12 times by Japanese models and nine times by European ones. Overall, . Consumer Reports said it found the 2014 Impala competitive with cars . that cost $20,000 more, including the Audi A6, Lexus LS460L, Acura RLX . and Jaguar XF. Luxury vehicles: The MW 135i Convertible proved tough competition for the Impala and scored 97 points out of 100, but was not in the sedan category . Fisher said many high-end cars suffer from over-complexity, while the new Impala has many nice features but remains easy to use. The magazine praised the new Impala for its luxurious feel; spacious and high-quality interior; easy-to-use and intuitive controls; and strong handling and braking. It said the car's 22 miles per gallon fuel efficiency as rated by the magazine was competitive but not best in class. However, since it is so new, there is no reliability data for the Impala and Consumer Reports did not add the large sedan to its 'recommended' list. To achieve that, a vehicle must perform well in the magazine's testing, have average or better reliability and perform well in government and industry crash tests. In other testing, Consumer Reports said the redesigned, seven-passenger version of the Hyundai Santa Fe now ranks as the top mid-sized SUV ahead of the Toyota Highlander.

"Compassion:Prince Charles has said the NHS should listen to patients and be more caring . The Health Service must learn to listen to its patients and be more caring, Prince Charles said yesterday. Modern medicine and technology are putting the ‘human touch’ at risk, according to the heir to the throne. In a heartfelt plea, he said medical schools should try to foster a climate of care and compassion among doctors. Charles’s intervention follows a series of reports of appalling treatment by NHS staff, including dying patients left screaming for water. He called on doctors and nurses to heed what patients say so they can develop the ‘healing empathy’ so badly needed. Writing in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, the prince set out a vision apparently in response to studies showing many patients feel ignored. He said: ‘In the individual encounter between patient and clinician, we are led to believe that there is currently a “crisis in caring”. I am sure that this is not the case in many or most such encounters. ‘Nevertheless, I am equally sure that there is much more that can be done to foster and enhance those age-old qualities of human kindness and compassion. ‘The media is full of instances where these have been palpably lacking, and I have heard of others speaking of the need to restore urgently a climate of care and compassion at the heart of our health services.’ Last month, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was a ‘kind of normalisation of cruelty’ in the worst hospitals, with patients too often subjected to coldness, resentment, indifference and even contempt. Ann Clwyd, Labour MP for Cynon Valley, broke down when describing how her husband of 49 years, Owen Roberts, ‘died like a battery hen’ in October after being admitted to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. And, in an unprecedented move, the Chief Nursing Officer for England says nurses will now be formally judged on the compassion they show in ‘treating patients with dignity and respect’. The Daily Mail has highlighted abuses of patient care in its Dignity for the Elderly campaign. In his article, the prince said there was unease about poor listening skills that ultimately let down patients. One senior professional had impressed upon him the need to equip staff ‘with skills and a desire to listen and honour what is being said and – importantly – what is not said to them’. Charles said a healing empathy could only develop with a ‘thorough understanding of the patient’s story’. Despite his reputation as a supporter of alternative medicine, the Prince of Wales stressed he did not want to confront accepted medical wisdom. But, he said, the best of science and technology must not be deployed ‘at the expense of the human elements’. The prince has endorsed homeopathy and has had treatment from herbalists and chiropractors for ailments including severe back pain. He says complementary therapies should be used alongside conventional medicine. The Prince of Wales said: 'It seems to me good medicine should aim for a better balance between what science and technology may demand and what patients may actually want and need.¿ . Prince Charles talking to staff at The Centre for Defence Medicine based at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, during a recent visit . But he has been criticised by leading medical figures including Nobel prize-winners, for backing therapies they claim undermine treatments proven to work and may even put patients at risk. In his guest editorial, the prince said he had long advocated truly integrated systems of providing health and care ‘not without criticism’. But the need for a wider perspective on healthcare remained, particularly when the lack of compassion undermined the very purpose of doctors’ training. He said: ‘It is particularly surprising so many appear to think there is a gap here, when we are told those so-called “soft skills” of caring can have a significant impact on the quality and pace of recovery among patients. Prince Charles has spoken out on medical matters previously arguing that complementary therapies such as homeopathy should be used alongside conventional medicine . ‘This inevitably raises the question: “Are we doing enough to ensure there is sufficient empathy and compassion instilled throughout training in medical schools and in later hospital training?” ‘Should we not, perhaps, be doing more to enhance the length of contact and continuity, when it comes to relationships between professionals and patients? ‘It appears to many ... that our capacity for providing “the human touch” has steadily decreased as science and technology have improved. Surely, it should not be either/or? Thus, it seems to me good medicine should aim for a better balance between what science and technology may demand and what patients may actually want and need.’ Dr Kamran Abbasi, the journal’s editor, said: ‘This is an important article and the prince’s vision for health is engaging.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: 'Ensuring that patients get the best possible care is a priority. We have been clear that quality of care needs to be valued as highly as the quality of treatment. ' 'Nursing leaders recently launched a new drive to ensure values such as compassion and courage are at the heart of the NHS and the public health and care sectors.'","His Royal Highness makes heartfelt plea to medical profession .

"A Florida waitress who went the extra mile after a customer left behind $1,000 in cash has been rewarded for her honesty, even though she returned the money to the wrong guy. Pregnant Samantha Knight, of Punta Gorda, found the stash of $100 dollar bills on the seat at one of her tables during her Tuesday night shift at Laishley Crab House. An unusual series of events, including giving the money to the wrong person, ended with her being given the full $1,000 plus an extra $100 tip. Ms Knight initially raced to the front of the restaurant to return the money roll to the customer she thought had left it behind - but she handed it to the wrong guy, and he left with the $1,000. Take the money and run: Surveillance footage at Laishley Crab House shows a waitress handing over $1,000 in lost cash she believed belonged to the man leaving on the right . Mix-up: Waitress Samantha Knight says she thought she was returning it to the right customer, and he acted like the lost money was his . The mix-up happened last Tuesday at Laishley Crab House in Punta Gorda, Florida . 'I was like ""you left this in the booth."" He said ""thanks,"" patted his pocket, took it and walked away,' Ms Knight told WBBH. It was only after the man left with the small fortune that the waitress realized she mixed up tables and handed the money to the wrong customer. The man who actually dropped the money, Chuck Behm, was filmed leaving the restaurant just one minute prior - he soon came back looking for his cash. When told what happened, he was upset and said he'd have let her keep it. He didn't blame her for the confusion, instead blaming the guy who initially took money that wasn't his. 'I felt awful. I still feel madder than anything at that guy,' he told WBBH from back home in Chicago.

After he returned the money, the man, who asked not to be identified, gave the soon-to-be-mother an extra $100 tip 'for her troubles.' When contacted by Ms Knight to say the money was returned, Mr Behm stayed true to his word and told the hard working woman to keep it. 'I called him this morning and let him know,' she told the New York Daily News. 'He said, ""It's yours to keep.""' Honesty does pay off, and Ms Knight's proof is in her purse being $1,100 richer.

"Facebook may have bought Oculus Rift, but now Google is reportedly splashing out virtual reality technology too. The search giant is set to invest $500 million (£314 million) in Magic Leap, which claims to have invented be a realistic version of virtual and augmented reality, dubbed ‘cinematic reality’. The Florida-based firm’s website features a little elephant moving around realistically in a person’s hands, to show off their capabilities. Scroll down for video . Google is reportedly set to invest $500 million (£314 million) in Magic Leap, which claims to be a realistic version of virtual and augmented reality, dubbed ‘cinematic reality’. The Florida-based firm’s website features a little elephant (pictured) moving around realistically in a person’s hands, to show what it can do . Gamers hope that Facebook and Google’s involvement in the virtual reality space will accelerate the technology, which would make playing games and watching films more realistic, as well as creating other immersive experiences. Google is tipped to be joined by other large investors such as Andreessen Horowitz in the secretive fundraising round, Re/code reported, citing anonymous sources. The company has already raised $50 million (£31 million) in funding earlier this year, but rumours of the new tranche of funding have not been confirmed by any of the parties involved. Rory Abovitz, Magic Leap’s CEO, said his firm is working on ‘the most natural and human-friendly wearable computing interface in the world.’ Magic Leap's system claims to be more realistic than the Oculus Rift (pictured). The firm was acquired earlier this year by Facebook for $2 billion, and gamers are waiting for a consumer version of the virtual reality headset to be launched . An expert has claimed that ultra-realistic games played using virtual reality headsets could kill people. Denny Unger believes that the technology is so immersive that the first incidence of someone being scared to death, is not far away. Mr Unger, creative director at Cloudhead Games warned a virtual reality panel in Seattle that ‘we’re very close to having the first death in VR’,Gizmodo reported. He said:‘When the commercial version comes out, somebody is going to scare somebody to death - somebody with a heart condition or something like that. It is going to happen. Absolutely.’ Many realistic video games played on standard consoles make players feel tense and villains often jump out and 'attack' gamers. But this effect could be intensified hugely when virtual reality headsets become widely available. Very few details about the technology have been revealed, aside from saying it offers a more realistic experience than Oculus Rift. Mr Abovitz told The South Florida Business Journal that virtual reality and augmented reality are old terms, with a largely disappointing history. ‘We have the term “cinematic reality” because we are disassociated with those things. … When you see this, you will see that this is computing for the next 30 or 40 years. ‘To go farther and deeper than we’re going, you would be changing what it means to be human.’ It is likely that the device will show wearers hi-resolution images close to their face, by projecting pictures onto the eye. Viewers will probably see different angles and depths when they adjust their focus. This would be beneficial because Magic Leap could mix virtual reality images with the real world. While it is not clear what form the technology takes, Mr Abovitz has previously said that he hopes it could one day be built into a pair of glasses, in which case, Google may aim on incorporating ‘cinematic reality’ into future iterations of Google Glass. It is likely that the device will show wearers hi-resolution images close to their face, by projecting pictures onto the eye. Viewers will probably see different angles and depths when they adjust their focus. An image showing the burring of a fantastical virtual reality object and the real world produced by the company is pictured . The smart spectacles already enable users to access augmented reality elements. Using a particular app for example, runners can wear the glasses to see monsters chasing them. The glasses also superimpose information on the periphery of a wearer’s vision. Facebook spent $2 billion buying Oculus earlier this year, which makes a virtual reality headset, mostly aimed at gamers. Unlike Magic Leap’s future device, it blocks out the real world around the user. While it is not clear what form the technology takes, Mr Abovitz has previously said that he hopes it could one day be built into a pair of glasses, in which case, Google may aim on incorporating ‘cinematic reality’ into future iterations of Google Glass (pictured) Last month, Oculus unveiled its Crescent Bay model of the virtual reality technology that is lighter than its predecessor, and now features 360-degree tracking. Reports claimed the consumer version of the device will launch in 2015 and could cost as little as $200 (£122) The 360-degree tracking means the headset will be able to more accurately monitor a wearer's head movements, which in turn will make games more immersive and true-to-life. Elsewhere, the headset has a higher resolution, per eye, than the current second-generation development kit – DK2 - and these displays are powered by Samsung devices. A teardown of the DK2 revealed that the headset uses Samsung Galaxy Note 3 displays, and experts claim the latest generation device will feature screens from the flagship Note 4. By comparison, the DK2 has a resolution of 960 x 1080 per eye, and the Note 4 screens would give the latest model 1280 x 1440 resolution. Aside from these specifications, Oculus VR is yet to release the rest of Crescent Bay’s features, or a price tag for the gadget.","Google is tipped to invest $500 million (£314 million) in Magic Leap .

"Agent nets more than £1m in transfer fees . Massive wage bill puts club at risk . An alarming picture has emerged of the financial chaos at the heart of  crisis club Blackburn Rovers. Under global adviser Shebby Singh, millions of pounds of owners Venky’s money has been spent on a succession of disastrous signings. Singh arrived at Ewood Park in June 2012, and despite his limited understanding of the transfer market, he operated remarkably swiftly to bring in new blood. Global Adviser: Shebby Singh has overseen the spending at Ewood Park . As the club prepared for life in the Championship after their relegation from the Barclays Premier League last May, Singh recommended payments of more than £600,000 in agents’ fees to sign five unknown Portuguese players. These are players who, between them, have made just four league starts this season, and three are now on loan at other clubs. But it does not end there. Sportsmail’s investigation has discovered that Blackburn, who could end up in League One next season, are burdened with a group of 13 players whose combined wages and agents’ fees will cost the club £30million over the length of their contracts. Diogo Rosado: Age: 23, Starts: 1, Agent fee: £135,000 . Edinho Junior: Age: 19, Starts 2, Agent fee: £150,000 . Fabio Nunes: Age: 20, Starts: 2, Agent fee: £150,000 . Paulo Jorge: Age 20, Starts: 0, Agent fee: £156,000 . Nuno Henrique: Age: 26, Starts: 0, Agent fee: £65,000 . This week, Venky’s demanded that . Singh, along with chief executive Derek Shaw and operations director . Paul Agnew, plus caretaker manager Gary Bowyer, attend summit talks in . India. Adding to the . confusion, last week Singh gave Shaw a letter ordering him to stay at . home while the club investigated the former manager Henning Berg’s . £2million High Court claim for compensation. Berg, one of four managers . to serve Blackburn during this insane season at Ewood Park, was . dismissed after just 57 days. However, . the club insisted there was ‘no investigation’ into Shaw, . even though club officials have confirmed that he received a letter from . Singh. They did, however, state that £500,000 has been paid to . Berg. Passage to India: Gary Bowyer has been summoned for a meeting with the club's owners . Rover and out: Steve Kean, Henning Berg and Michael Appleton have all left Blackburn this season . The payments made to agents by the club, third from bottom in the Championship and in danger of a second successive relegation, are staggering. One agent received more than £1m for acting on behalf of clients Danny Murphy, Dickson Etuhu, Leon Best and loan signing Colin Kazim-Richards. It’s a similar story with the signing of the Portuguese unknowns. For instance, agent Marcos Oliveira was paid £135,000 when Diogo Rosado, 23, was signed from Sporting Lisbon on August 31, 2012. Rosado made just one Championship start for Rovers before he was allowed to move on loan to Benfica’s B team in January. Edinho Junior, who started just one game in the league for Rovers, is also out on loan, at Shillong Lajong in the I-League in India. Oliveira, whose name appears on the documents lodged with the FA, was paid £100,000 in the deal that secured Junior from Portuguese side Olhanense. Making the move: Danny Murphy joined Blackburn from Fulham in the summer . The agent also negotiated a £65,000 fee that brought jobbing Portuguese pro Nuno Henrique Goncalves, a 26-year-old defender, to Rovers last summer. Goncalves has not made a single appearance for the club. Oliveira’s influence went beyond the Portuguese players. He received £75,000 in the deal to sign Polish goalkeeper Gregor Sandomierski on loan from Genk for a season. In other moves, midfielder Fabio Nunes had shown little promise with Portuguese side Portimonense in the Segunda Liga when he was suddenly signed by Rovers, netting his agent Nuno Rolo a staggering £150,000 commission. Nunes, 20, has made just two Championship starts for Rovers, the last in a 2-1 home defeat by Middlesbrough in September. Rolo pocketed a further £133,000 in fees in the deal to bring former Portugal striker Nuno Gomes, 36, to Ewood Park. Picked up from Braga, he has made just seven starts for Blackburn in the Championship, without a goal since September. Although Rolo has told Sportsmail he was simply used as the transfer fixer by Singh, he did confirm that he was paid for the deal. Championship player, Premier League wages: Dickson Etuhu is understood to earn £30,000 per week . The final piece in Singh’s Portuguese jigsaw was the arrival of midfielder Paulo Jorge, 20, from Porto, for which Carlos Mendes was paid £156,000 commission. Jorge has made one seven-minute appearance in the league against Ipswich in August and has since been loaned to a Bulgarian side. Singh, who has seen Steve Kean resign as manager before sacking Berg and Michael Appleton this season, also authorised huge wages for players with Premier League experience. Agent Neil Fewings earned £1m from the transactions taking Murphy and Etuhu from Fulham, the acquisition of Newcastle forward Best, and the loan deal for Kazim-Richards from Galatasaray. Murphy has made 33 Championship appearances and started for the first time in a month in the 3-0 defeat at Cardiff on April 1. He is on £35,000 a week, with Etuhu on £30,000 a week. Injury problems: Leon Best has been out for much of the season after picking up an injury in pre-season . Best is on a similar amount — he ruptured cruciate ligaments in pre-season and only returned to the first team a month ago. On Tuesday night, the club officially refused to comment after being made aware of the precise content of the transactions — Singh did not return calls. Sportsmail gave the financial details and the names of the agents to chief executive Shaw and club secretary Ian Silvester on Tuesday lunchtime. Both declined to comment, as did Mendes and Oliveira. Fewings insisted he had acted ‘in good faith and for the benefit of his clients’, while Rolo insisted that the deals he was involved in were ‘perfectly normal’.","Agent nets more than £1m in transfer fees .

"A megachurch is closing several of its branches after its founder said women were created to give men homes for their penises. The online comments made by Pastor Mark Driscoll are just the latest scandal for the beleaguered Mars Hill, a collection of 15 evangelical churches now facing financial strains and severe staff cuts. Driscoll, 43, has also stepped down while multiple accusations about his conduct are investigated. Most recently, a feminist blogger, Libby Anne, uncovered messages that he wrote on an internet message board under a pseudonym in 2001 and shared them on her blog on Patheos. Beleaguered: Pastor Mark Driscoll, the founder of Mars Hill megachurch, wrote online that women were created to give homes to men's penises. He has stepped down pending an investigation into his conduct . 'The first thing to know about your penis is, that despite the way it may see, it is not your penis,' he wrote. 'Ultimately, God created you and it is his penis. You are simply borrowing it for a while. 'While His penis is on loan you must admit that it is sort of just hanging out there very lonely as if it needed a home, sort of like a man wondering the streets looking for a house to live in. 'Knowing that His penis would need a home, God created a woman to be your wife and when you marry her and look down you will notice that your wife is shaped differently than you and makes a very nice home.' He then continued with his analogy to say men must not cheat or masturbate. 'Though you may believe your hand is shaped like a home, it is not,' he wrote. 'And, though women other than your wife may look like a home, to rest there would be breaking into another man’s home.' As she shared a screenshot of the messages on her blog, Libby Anne added: 'I have rarely seen an evangelical man assert male superiority and prominence this directly.' She added: 'In Driscoll's treatment, women are no more than penis homes. Women were created to satisfy men. There is nothing uplifting or honored in that.' Scandal: His church has also been accused of mishandling funds and paying to boost sales of his book . In 2001, under a pseudonym, William Wallace II, Mark Driscoll wrote: . 'The first thing to know about your penis is, that despite the way it may see, it is not your penis. Ultimately, God created you and it is his penis. You are simply borrowing it for a while. 'While His penis is on loan you must admit that it is sort of just hanging out there very lonely as if it needed a home, sort of like a man wondering the streets looking for a house to live in. 'Knowing that His penis would need a home, God created a woman to be your wife and when you marry her and look down you will notice that your wife is shaped differently than you and makes a very nice home. 'Therefore, if you are single you must remember that your penis is homeless and needs a home. Though you may believe your hand is shaped like a home, it is not,' he wrote. 'And, though women other than your wife may look like a home, to rest there would be breaking into another man’s home.' The comments were found after Driscoll admitted in his 2006 book 'Confessions of a Reformission Rev' that he had attacked feminists and liberals in online posts under the name William Wallace II. Subsequent internet searches revealed his crude rants against women, feminists and homosexuals under the topic 'Pussified Nation'. After these messages emerged, as well as other accusations concerning misspent funds and plagiarism, Driscoll announced that he was taking a sabbatical for six weeks to allow for investigations. And on Sunday, Mars Hill announced that financial pressures following negative news reports are forcing them to close or consolidate some branches across five states, the Seattle Times reported. The church, which has 15 branches in total, also plans to cut 30 to 40 per cent of its 100 paid staff - in addition to pastors who have recently left after being angry about the church's direction. Among the branches affected by closures or consolidations are those in Phoenix, downtown Seattle and Huntington Beach, California. At the beginning of the year, Mars Hill welcomed up to 13,000 people through their doors, but now attendance is down to as low as 8,000 a week, a church spokesperson told the Times. Popular: His megachurch has 15 branches across five states - but some have now been forced to close . Driscoll has long been a controversial figure, particularly because of his view of women and homosexuality, but other accusations have also damaged his reputation. Last year, an evangelical radio host accused Driscoll of plagiarizing some passages in one of his books, A Call to Resurgence, claiming they were largely stolen from another text. The church was then accused of getting a company to buy up one of his books, manipulating sales figures and boosting the book so that it appeared on the New York Times Bestseller list. In another scandal, the church also admitted that money they said was being used to start church overseas were actually being used for expenses at U.S. churches. Driscoll issued an apology online, saying: 'I will seek to resolve unresolved issues with others, and will seek to avoid such conflict in the future; at least to the extent I have any control over it.' But some members of the congregation protested that he had fallen short of a good apology, while others said that church leaders had failed to investigate the original complaints fully.","Pastor Mark Driscoll, 43, is the founder of Mars Hill, an evangelical megachurch with branches across five states .

"At least 40 people have been killed in a wave of sectarian car bombings across Iraq. Shiite neighbourhoods of Baghdad and the southern city of Basra were targeted as bombers struck at market places and crowded bus stops during the busy morning hours, officials said. The attacks, which left dozens of people injured, are the latest in a recent spike of bombings that has hit both Sunni and Shiite civilian targets over the past week. Wreckage: Civilians gather at the site of a car bomb attack in front of a crowded restaurant in Basra in southeast Iraq. Two car bombs left dozens killed and injured in the city today . Tensions: Iraqi security forces gather at the site of the car bomb. The attacks are believed to have targeted Shiite areas as sectarian tensions heighten across the country . Terror: A shocked woman is left in tears as civilians peer at the destruction left by the bomb attack in Basra . The bloodshed has raised fears of a return to the widespread sectarian violence of 2006-2007 that brought the country to the edge of civil war. In the Iraqi capital, nine car bombs went off at bus stops, open-air markets and in the streets of Shiite areas, killing 27 people and wounding 116, according to police officials. The deadliest attacks came in the northern Sabi al-Boor neighborhood and in Baghdad's eastern suburb of Kamaliya. Seven people were killed in each of those attacks. In the southern city of Basra, two car bombs - one near a restaurant and the other at the city's main bus station - killed at least 13 and wounded 40, according to the provincial police spokesman, Col. Abdul-Karim al-Zaidi, and the head of city's health directorate, Riadh Abdul-Amir. The blast at the Basra bus station ripped through food stalls that serve falafel and eggs to travelers. Slippers lay scattered on the bloodstained pavement. Aftermath: Civilians gather at the scene of another car bomb attack in Kamaliyah, a predominantly Shiite area of eastern Baghdad . Shock: A boy on a bike joins other onlookers at the scene of the bombing in Kamaliyah. The country's Sunni minority has held recent protests against alleged abuse and neglect by the majority Shiite government . Destruction: A vehicle lies on its side following the bombing in Baghdad. There are fears a recent spike in sectarian violence will destabilise the country . A Basra resident, Talib Dakhil, said he was at the station when the explosion went off. 'This will not discourage us from continuing our life,' he said. 'We will continue challenging terrorism, whatever happens.' No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blasts but such large-scale bombings bear the hallmarks of al-Qaida in Iraq. Hospital officials in Baghdad and Basra confirmed the casualty tolls. All the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. In Baghdad, Malik Ibrahim blamed the government and political parties for the bloodshed and the lack of security in the country. 'How long do we have to continue living like this, with all the lies from the government,' asked the 23-year-old Baghdad resident. 'Whenever they say they have reached a solution, the bombings come back stronger than before. We're fed up with them and we can't tolerate this anymore,' he added. Fear: The attacks in Baghdad (pictured) and in Basra have led to fears of a return to the dark days when the country appeared on the brink of civil war . Force: A boy looks at the shattered remains of a vehicle caught in the Baghdad bomb attack. The force of the explosion destroyed most of the vehicle . Tensions have been intensifying in Iraq since the country's minority since Sunnis began protesting what they say is mistreatment at the hands of the Shiite-led government, including random detentions and neglect. The protests, which began in December, have largely been peaceful, but the number of attacks rose sharply after a deadly security crackdown on a Sunni protest camp in the country's north on April 23. Majority Shiites control the levers of power in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq. Wishing to rebuild the nation rather than revert to open warfare, they have largely restrained their militias over the past five years or so as Sunni extremist groups such as al-Qaida have targeted them with occasional large-scale attacks.","Bombers target Shiite neighbourhoods in Baghdad and Basra .

A man called Domenick emailed the site to say that he believes his and his neighbor's children first came across the shark during a day at the Coney Island beach. He told the Gothamist that the shark washed up on the beach and the lifeguard allowed the children to take pictures with it. The father added that his daughter was keen to pick up the creature - but the boys in the group backed off. The last that the children seen of the shark, was a 'guy' heading off with him.

"Rummaging through a suitcase and examining some newly delivered post… she couldn’t look more at home. But while this woman may seem very interested in the belongings strewn around this hotel room, none of them are hers. She is a hotel cleaner, who was caught on camera going through a guest’s things when she entered his room to change the sheets. The cleaner, who works at an unidentified hotel chain in the U.S.,  can be seen looking through the guest's suitcase in the secret recording . The young woman cleaning the room can also be seen looking at the PS3 Games belonging to the hotel guest after he set up a secret camera . Vince Stravix decided to leave his laptop camera recording when he stepped out of his room at an unidentified American hotel. And after capturing what the cleaner got up to when she thought she was alone, he put the video on YouTube to warn others to keep their belongings stored away at hotels. The video has already had more than one million views on YouTube since it was uploaded on Saturday. Mr Stravix wrote on the website: ‘This happened on November 5, 2014. I was staying at a brand-named hotel and I kept all of my items laid out in my room. Not any more though…’ He added: ‘[I’m] making people aware that even in a hotel room someone could rifle through your things without you knowing, so password-protect everything you own and keep valuables locked up.’ You've got mail: The housekeeper was caught on camera reading the details on a package that was delivered to the guest . The housekeeper was caught on camera having a close look at the hotel guest's tablet while she was cleaning the room earlier this month . The video begins innocuously enough – the woman enters the room, wanders into the bathroom, and collects dirty towels into a pile. But while carrying out her chores, she can’t seem to resist having a closer look around. She picks up a package addressed to Mr Stravix, before moving on to touch his games console, a PS3, and the games with it. After looking through the suitcase, she turns to the laptop, with Mr Stravix claiming she tried to type something on the keyboard. Although he refused to name the hotel or location, he said he has sent the management all of his footage. YouTube users criticised the incident as a gross invasion of privacy. Others pointed out the housekeeper cleaned the bathroom, then made the bed, while wearing the same pair of gloves.","Hotel guest left video camera running while he was out of the room at an unidentified hotel in the US .

"Pioneer? Mary Seacole was voted  greatest Black Briton but are people misguided? She is regarded as our greatest black Briton, a woman who did more to advance the cause of nursing - and race relations - than almost any other individual. On the Crimea's bloody battlefields, she is said to have saved the lives of countless wounded soldiers and nursed them to health in a clinic paid for out of her own pocket. Her name was Mary Seacole, and today she is almost as famous as that other nursing heroine, Florence Nightingale. For decades after her death in 1881, Seacole's story was largely overlooked, but for the past 15 years her reputation and exploits have undergone a remarkable rehabilitation. Schoolchildren are taught about her achievements and for many, Seacole, born in Jamaica in 1805 to a white Scottish officer called Grant and a Creole woman from whom Mary learned her 'nursing skills', is seen as a secular saint. Numerous schools, hospitals and universities have rooms or buildings named after her, and shortly she will get her greatest tribute yet: an 8ft tall bronze statue is to be erected to her memory in the grounds of St Thomas's Hospital, facing towards the Houses of Parliament. The £500,000 memorial - larger than the statue of Florence Nightingale near Pall Mall - will show Seacole marching out to the battlefield, a medical bag over her shoulder, a row of medals proudly pinned to her chest. There's just one problem: historians around the world are growing increasingly uneasy about the statue, amid claims the adulation of Seacole has gone too far. They claim her achievements have been hugely oversold for political reasons, and out of a commendable - but in this case misguided - desire to create positive black role models. Now Seacole is at the centre of a new controversy with the news that the story of her life will no longer be taught to thousands of pupils. Forgotten angel of the Crimea: For decades after her death, Seacole's story was largely overlooked . Westminster Education Secretary Michael Gove has decreed that instead they will learn about traditional figures such as Oliver Cromwell and Winston Churchill. So is it unfair to reduce her standing in this way? Not according to several historians. 'The hype that has built up surrounding this otherwise worthy woman is a disgrace to the serious study of history,' declares William Curtis of the Crimean War Research Society. His views are shared by Major Colin Robins, a Fellow of the Historical Society who recently wrote a paper for an academic journal stating that Seacole is the 'subject of many myths', arguing that numerous 'facts' concerning her life are simply untrue. Indeed, Major Robins singles out the teaching of some of the stories about Seacole as 'irresponsible' and 'certainly not history'. Meanwhile, leading the charge against the statue being placed at St Thomas's is Lynn McDonald, a history professor and world expert on Florence Nightingale, who feels Seacole is being promoted at the expense of Nightingale. Contemporary accounts: Seacole depicted in Punch magazine on May 30, 1857 . 'Nightingale was the pioneer nurse, not Mary Seacole,' says McDonald. 'It's fine to have a statue to whoever you want, but Seacole was not a pioneer nurse, she didn't call herself a nurse, she didn't practise nursing, and she had no association with St Thomas's or any other hospital.' 'Seacole was not a pioneer nurse, she didn't call herself a nurse, she didn't practise nursing' So are these protests justified? Was the real Mary Seacole the heroine she has been made out to be? Textbooks used for the current National Curriculum say that in her twenties, Seacole married a Jamaican merchant called Edwin Seacole and they travelled around the Caribbean, Central America and England until his death in 1844. Seacole then set up a 'hotel' in the town of Cruces in Panama, where she is reputed to have treated cholera victims. With the outbreak of the Crimean War later that year, Seacole was determined to offer her nursing services to the British and, when she was turned down, paid her way to the peninsula out of her own pocket. Celebrated: A lost painting of Mary Seacole from 1869 went on display at  National Portrait Gallery in 2011 . Once she had arrived in the Crimea, Seacole tried to work for Florence Nightingale, who supposedly turned her away. Instead, she established her 'British Hotel' - part boarding house, part medical centre - from where she sold alcohol, hearty food and ran a daily clinic, as well as tending to the sick on the battlefield, even under bombardment. For all this, she was awarded the Crimea Medal. After the war ended, Seacole returned to Britain, so impoverished she had to declare bankruptcy. However, such was her reputation a benefit fund was established for her, which received the blessing of Queen Victoria. By the time she died in 1881, Seacole had retreated into obscurity and not until recently was she 'rediscovered' as a heroine of Crimea. That is the version of events taught to schoolchildren in recent years. Unfortunately, many key details are either untrue or stretch credulity to breaking point. Part of the problem is that much of the historical record concerning Seacole comes from her autobiography, which contains downright inventions, including meetings with people whom she could never have encountered. Other key details have been embellished or invented by contemporary accounts. And although Seacole is championed as a black heroine - voted greatest Black Briton of all time in a 2004 poll - she was actually three-quarters white. Heritage: A blue plaque was unveiled in 2007 by culture secretary Margaret Hodge and Professor Elizabeth, from the Mary Seacole Memorial Statue Appeal, marking the nurses home at 14 Soho Square in London . Her mother was mixed race and her father white. In her book, Seacole claims her skin is more 'yellow' than black, and she displayed more pride in her white Scottish ancestry than her black Jamaican heritage. 'Anyone who employs Mrs Seacole,' Nightingale wrote, 'will introduce much kindness - also much drunkenness . and improper conduct, wherever she is' Furthermore, although one observer noted that she was 'a few shades darker than the white lily', her skin colour seems to have attracted remarkably little attention from those she helped in the Crimea. However, today, Seacole's skin colour is seen as being vitally important - and stated as the reason the War Office rejected her offers of assistance. Seacole did wonder whether she was a victim of racism: 'Did these ladies shrink from accepting my aid because my blood flowed beneath a somewhat duskier skin than theirs?' she asked. But although race could have been a factor, Seacole was more likely to have been rejected because of her age - she was 50 when she volunteered - and the type of home-made medicine she practised, which was regarded as quackery by the medical establishment. Seacole herself admitted that when she treated the sick in Panama she made 'lamentable blunders' so she 'lost patients which a little later I could have saved'. She even administered highly toxic lead acetate as an attempted treatment for cholera. Thin Red Line: British troops at the Battle of Balaclava on October 25, 1854, during the Crimean War . And she knew her lack of qualifications made the Army wary. 'I am not for a single instant going to blame the authorities who would not listen to the offer of a motherly yellow woman,' she wrote. Another myth beloved of the politically correct telling of Seacole's story is that her offers of help were personally rejected by Florence Nightingale. Once again, this is untrue. In her autobiography, Seacole says she was not interested in working at Nightingale's hospital at Scutari and instead only asked the celebrated 'Lady of the Lamp' for a bed for the night, which was duly granted. Throughout her life, Seacole spoke warmly of Nightingale, although the feeling was not mutual. Nightingale regarded Seacole's British Hotel 'as something approaching a 'bad house'', and believed that although she was 'kind to the men . . . and did some good', she 'made many drunk'. 'Anyone who employs Mrs Seacole,' Nightingale wrote, 'will introduce much kindness - also much drunkenness and improper conduct, wherever she is.' Yet if the haughty Nightingale cared little for her, there is no doubt Seacole was a favourite among the men. Despite its high prices, her 'hotel' (more a glorified hut) was a popular place to eat, drink . . . and drink some more. Icon: An 8ft statue of Mary Seacole is to be built at St Thomas's Hospital in London . Heroine: Florence Nightingale is Britain's most famous nurse from the bloody Crimea conflict . 'All the men swore by her,' wrote one, 'and in case of any malady would seek her advice and use her herbal medicines, in preference to reporting to their own doctors.' But the idea that she ran a clinic or some sort of hospital is a gross exaggeration. 'The story of Mary Seacole has been spun . out of all proportion, her memory hijacked and her achievements . embellished in order to provide a role model' There was no accommodation at the 'hotel', and although she may have dispensed herbal home-made medicines to alleviate symptoms of ailments such as diarrhoea, the idea that a single woman working alone and away from a hospital could have done anything to combat an illness as deadly as cholera is far-fetched in the extreme. In truth, Mary Seacole was more of a mother figure to the officers and men. She was well-liked and she undoubtedly did at some point go onto a battlefield dispensing comforts such as wine and doing her best to deal with the odd injury. It was her popularity that led to a benefit fund being set up for her when she returned bankrupted to Britain - much to the chagrin of Nightingale, who felt Queen Victoria had been misled into supporting the campaign. 'A shameful ignorant imposture was practised on the Queen,' she wrote privately. And . contrary to many historical accounts, Seacole was never awarded a . Crimea Medal for her efforts. Although she often wore the medal, her . name does not appear on any of the official rolls. Although some would say she was morally deserving of recognition –- and indeed a statue - for her warm heart and personal courage, the story of Mary Seacole has been spun out of all proportion, her memory hijacked and her achievements embellished in order to provide a role model. It may be good politics, but it is poor history.","Claims of her achievements have been hugely .

"Tony and Cherie Blair were not initially noted for their shrewd moves in the housing market. Shortly before London’s property boom, they sold the Islington home where Mr Blair plotted Labour’s 1997 election victory and moved into Downing Street. But if that was a painful lesson, it is one that they learned very quickly. Nicky's new Georgian townhouse, worth £1.35million, (left) is walking distance from the Blairs' £3.65million Grade II listed mansion (right) they bought in 2004 . Nicky Blair (pictured far left, with Kathryn, Tony, Cherie and Euan) is the latest Blair to be bought his own property. Now it emerges that another property has been added to the Blair portfolio – this time a new home for son Nicky – as they continue to invest the former Prime Minister’s growing fortune in some of the capital’s prime locations. The four-storey, £1.35million Georgian townhouse in central London was paid for with cash. It is the third costly home in almost as many years that the Blairs have bought, mortgage-free, for their children and brings the combined value of the seven properties owned by the family to an estimated £20million. But given that Mr Blair reputedly earns £20million a year from government advisory work, speeches and consultancy work and has amassed a fortune of up to £60million, it will hardly dent the family finances. Nicky’s new house, like his previous property and the homes bought for siblings Euan and Kathryn, is within walking distance of the Blairs’ mansion, which they bought in 2004 for £3.65million. Two flats in Bristol which Cherie Blair bought for £260,000 (left) and the Blairs' £800,000 London mews house . According to Land Registry documents, all the children’s properties have joint ownership between them and their mother Cherie. The latest purchase, an un-modernised mid-terrace property was bought four months ago and the Blairs’ second son has obtained permission to drastically improve the house. Nicky, 27, a former teacher with ambitions to become a football agent, intends to erect a single-storey extension – with a ‘living sedum’ roof (made from plants). The work to provide a new kitchen and create ‘a good family home’ is understood to be costing several hundred thousand pounds. A spokesman for the Blairs said Nicky’s nearby mews house, bought for £1.13million in 2009 – again, without a mortgage – has been sold. The four-bedroom home was described as ‘the ultimate lad’s pad’. Last month it emerged that a computer games firm and football agency run by Nicky was being dissolved five years after its launch. South Pavilion, the Grade I seven-bedroom mansion in Buckinghamshire once owned by Sir John Gielgud was bought by Tony and Cherie Blair for £5.75m in 2008 . Grade II listed townhouse bought for Euan (left) and Georgian house bought for Kathryn for nearly £1 million . Accounts filed at Companies House show Magnitude Gaming made losses of almost £4,000 in 2008, more than £8,000 in 2009 and almost £17,000 in 2010. Oxford graduate Nicky and university friend Gabriel Moraes each owned a 40 per cent share, while Cherie had a 20 per cent stake. The company is solvent with no debts. Magnitude Gaming said it was restructuring to carry on trading as Magnitude Partnership. In 2010, Mrs Blair and eldest son Euan, 29, bought a townhouse for £1.29million. The three-bedroom, two bathroom Georgian property was purchased with a mortgage. Later in 2010, the Blairs paid £975,000 in cash for a three-bedroom maisonette for daughter Kathryn – again with Mrs Blair as joint owner with her child. Kathryn, 24, has followed her parents into the legal profession. The rest of the Blair property empire is outside London. South Pavilion, the magnificent country estate in the Chilterns once owned by Sir John Gielgud, is now valued at twice the £5.75million they paid for it four years ago. Less profitable were the two discounted flats in Bristol that Mrs Blair bought in 2003 with the help of convicted fraudster Peter Foster. She paid £262,500 for each but one has since been sold for £260,000.","The house bought for Nicky Blair brings Blairs' empire to £20million .

"Rugby World Cup 2015 will come 'far too soon' for rugby league convert Sam Burgess, according to Lewis Moody. World Cup-winner Moody believes Bath signing Burgess could struggle to master union's complexities and break into Stuart Lancaster's England squad in time for next year's global tournament. League sensation Burgess will swap Sydney for the south west next month, arriving at the Recreation Ground on October 15. Big change: Sam Burgess, pictured here in action for England's rugby league side, will become a union player next month when he joins Bath . Bath will pitch Burgess into action in the centres, with head coach Mike Ford still confident the 25-year-old will flourish in the back-row in time. Former Leicester and Bath flanker Moody, part of England's triumphant 2003 squad, believes next year's World Cup may be just out of reach for Burgess. 'There's a lot of interest and excitement around Sam's arrival, on how he'll fit into the Bath squad and what will happen with England,' Moody told Press Association Sport. 'Will they put him straight into the squad? With the way Stuart's been I find it hard to imagine that they would include him straight away. 'Going back to 2003 Josh Lewsey hadn't played many games for England going into the Six Nations. 'So there's always a chance for him, but I think the World Cup will be far too soon. 'But that won't be down to coaches or other players, it will be down to Sam and how quickly he fits into the game. Concerns: Former England star Lewis Moody believes Burgess will not earn himself an immediate call-up to Stuart Lancaster's World Cup squad . 'I'm sure he'll have been doing his homework on rucking and mauling, offside lines and dark arts, because it's a very different game.' Burgess pas proved an Australian sensation in four years at NRL outfit South Sydney, but will have just nine months to handle his code switch in time to make England's World Cup squad. England launch their World Cup bid on home soil on September 18 next year, but head coach Lancaster will have his extended training squad in place by July. Moody expects Burgess to thrive in union in the long-term, but believes his line-breaking talents will be best employed from the centres, not the back-row. 'Back-row is such a technical position and there's such a lot to learn, it's not just broken-field play, you've got the breakdown, scrum and line-out,' he said. 'I think back-row might be slightly too complicated, and will take some time to learn. 'Andy Farrell was moved between six and 12 when he came over from league and it didn't really fit. Talent: Moody thinks Burgess (left) could be a future centre for the national team . 'So if they just stick him at 12 and give him the opportunity to play and stick with that, then it will be far better for him than trying to move him into the forwards. 'I think Kyle Eastmond has done pretty well at the breakdown in his transition with Bath and England. 'He's squat and powerful, so he has the ability to make the tackle, get back to his feet and get over the ball, so he's been useful there. 'The technical side of the game is tough, but I'd imagine they'll keep it pretty simple for Sam at Bath straight away.' Land Rover ambassador Moody got his hands on the Webb Ellis Cup again at Twickenham, admitting World Cup fever is already hitting home. 'I found out for the first time you're only allowed to handle the World Cup with your bare hands if you've won it,' he said. 'So that's a nice touch that just brings home that achievement back in Australia in 2003 really. 'It was such a special part of my life and it's great to be able to look back on it with very fond memories. 'I would give anything to play a part in a World Cup in my own backyard, and hopefully England can go and achieve something special on home soil.'

"George Washington believed honesty was the most enviable quality in a human being, but the residents of the city that bears his name clearly don't agree. People in Washington D.C. are by far the most dishonest in America, according to a new study, while their cousins in Hawaii and Alabama are basically saints. Beverage company Honest Tea went to every U.S. state earlier this month and set up 61 unmanned kiosks offering tea for $1. Tea drinkers were instructed to place their buck in a box nearby. Mapping the nation's honesty: People in Washington D.C. are by far the most dishonest in America, while their cousins in Hawaii and Alabama are basically saints . But only eight in 10 beverage guzzlers in the nation's capital paid for their tea, while the other 20 per cent of people skipped out on the minimal amount. Washington's wise words: 'I hope I shall possess firmness and virtue enough to maintain what I consider the most enviable of all titles, the character of an honest man' The other states where you should hold on to your purse were West Virginia where only 85 per cent of participants paid for their tea, followed by Texas and Kentucky at 87 per cent. In comparison, everyone in Hawaii and Alabama paid up without exception. Indiana and Maine followed closely behind, with some 99 per cent proving to be honest, according to the company's fifth annual test. This year, however, was the first year every state has been represented. Unlike the city that shares its name, Washington state seemed to honor it's Founding Father's sentiment, scoring 96 per cent — considerably higher than the national average of 92 per cent. 'Even though my bicycle was stolen the same day as our DC experiment, it's reassuring to know that 92 per cent of Americans will do the right thing even when it seems no one is watching,' Honest Tea co-founder Seth Goldman said. New York ranked in the middle of the pack at 91 per cent, which was better than people expected. California tied with New Jersey, with a score of 96 per cent. The results also determined which sex . was more honest than the other and women slightly edged out men with a . score of 95 per cent compared to 91 per cent. Most honest: People in Hawaii, pictured, and Alabama were the most honest of all Americans according to the informal tea test . Unlike last year where redheads were most honest, in 2013 blondes were the most likely to pay, scoring 95 per cent, followed by brunettes, at 93 per cent and then redheads at 92 per cent. People with short hair were 91 per cent honest, vs. people with medium and long hair who were 93 per cent and 94 per cent honest, respectively. People in groups tended to be more honest than people on their own, perhaps because they were bullied by their friends.","In an informal test, 61 unmanned kiosks were set up across the U.S., with at least one in every state, offering tea for $1, with a dropbox nearby .

"The shop owner has admitted lacing his noodles with opium in a bid to 'improve business' A Chinese noodle shop owner has admitting lacing his dishes with opium in a bid to keep customers coming back. The added ingredient was only discovered when a customer who had just eaten at the restaurant in Shaanxi province was pulled over by traffic police. Liu Juyou was made to carry out a routine drugs test when he tested positive. He denied touching the illegal substance and suspected it might have been his earlier meal, according to the Xi’an Evening News. The 26-year-old was detained for 15 days on charges of drug abuse but was only released after he persuaded family members to try the noodles and then take a drugs test – and all of whom tested positive. The shop owner, named only as Zhang, has admitted that he bought 2kg (4.4lb) of poppy buds containing the plant’s seeds for 600 yuan (£60) in August. He crushed them into a powder and added the substance along with seasoning to his noodles to ‘make the food taste better’ and to ‘improve business’, reports the Hua Shang Bao. According to police, the unprocessed seeds contain enough opiates to progressively build up in the body, triggering a positive drugs test result. The paper also said that adding poppy seeds to hot pot sauce was not uncommon in China but its use has since been banned. Similar cases of lacing noodles with opium had been reported in 2010 and 2012. Zhang has reportedly been detained for 10 days. The opium was discovered when a man was stopped by traffic police and tested positive for drugs.

"Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt argues sharing GP records with universities and private firms will be valuable for medical research and screening for common diseases . GPs are threatening to boycott a ‘Big Brother’ database being introduced by the NHS. Under the new General Practice Extraction Service (GPES), doctors will be forced to send confidential patient records to a central database. The idea is a pet project of Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt – who argues sharing GP records with universities and private companies will be valuable for medical research and screening for common diseases. But GPs say NHS England has failed to tell patients about the ‘care.data’ scheme or to promote it properly. Dr Jane Lothian,  a GP and medical secretary of Northumberland Local Medical Committee (LMC), said patients were not getting ‘an informed choice’. Despite assurances the sensitive information will be kept anonymous, she feared patients could be identified from the data, saying: ‘With anything but very common conditions, people are identifiable.’ These worries prompted Northumberland LMC to contemplate ‘a county-wide opt out’ – and other LMCs have also been thinking along such lines. Dr Bruce Hughes, chairman  of Devon LMC, said GPs  were ‘almost duty bound’ to automatically opt-out of sending their patients’ medical records if they felt strongly about it. An NHS England spokesman said: ‘The programme will provide vital information to approved organisations about the quality of health services.’ GPs say NHS England has failed to tell patients about the 'care.data' scheme or to promote it properly.

"A transgender man is the first in Europe to give birth to a baby after becoming pregnant through a sperm donor. The unidentified man, who was born a woman, delivered the baby boy at home with a midwife in the poor Neukoellin district of Berlin. He insisted on a home birth because he refused to be listed as the mother on any hospital documents - a legal requirement of in Germany. The case in Germany mirrors that of Thomas Beatie in the US, pictured, who has given birth to three children and was the first man to ever give birth . The father, who maintained the reproductive organs of a woman, has been taking hormone replacement therapies for years to switch sexes. Details about the sperm donor or any relationship information has been withheld from the public as the father wanted to protect his son from any attention. Officially the child, who was born on March 18, does not have a mother, only a father. A spokesman for the Berlin Senate Administration for Internal Affairs said: 'The person in question did not want to appear as a mother but as a father on the birth certificate and that request has been honoured.' The expectant father also demanded that the gender of the child was 'not to be revealed under any circumstances'. But the authorities overruled this and announced it was a boy. According to sources, Germany's vast and overarching welfare state intends to keep close tabs on the child in case 'psychological problems' linked to his conception and birth develop. Family: Thomas Beatie was granted sole custody of his three children in May after footage emerged of his estranged wife Nancy being violent towards him . Germany's media reacted with astonishment at the news of the transgender birth. 'Baby belly instead of a beer belly!' was just one of the many headlines in German newspapers reporting on the birth. Meanwhile Falko Liecke, the conservative councillor in the district where the baby was born, said: 'This is something I have never heard or seen of.' In 2011 Germany's Supreme Court ruled that an  individual no longer had to have his or her's reproductive organs removed 'to gain civil legal recognition in the perceived gender'. That is why the father of this latest child became a man while retaining all the female reproductive organs. Dr Tobias Pottek of the Asklepios West Hospital in Hamburg said: 'Even if a woman wants to live as a man and takes hormones to grow a beard, as long as the uterus and ovaries are present, it is also possible to become pregnant. It is the first case of a child born in Europe of a transgender parent, but in the U.S. the case of Thomas Beatie, a transgernder man who has had three children, is well known. Mr Beatie was seeking a divorce from his wife, but was refused because the judge could not prove if the he was a man when he married. The judge decided there was no jurisdiction to grant a divorce if the marriage was not recognised.","Unidentified man gave birth in March to a boy at home in Berlin's Neukoellin district .

"A federal judge handed an Iranian-owned Fifth Avenue office building in New York to the government Monday. Worth as much as $700million, 650 Fifth Avenue was seized by the government because the owners funnelled rent money to Iran, a judge ruled. The 36-story building sits on the corner of 52nd Street, in the middle of one of the city’s toniest neighborhoods. Seized: 650 Fifth Avenue, a $700million office tower owned by an Iran-government affiliate, has been seized by the US government . This is believed to be ‘the largest real property forfeiture’ in the history of the US government, prosecutors told the New York Daily News. Proceeds from its sale will be given to the families of Iran-aided terror attack victims. Handed down by Manhattan Federal Judge Katherine Forrest, the decision is subject to appeal, the Daily News noted, but the ruling came only days before a separate private lawsuit was to commence in an attempt to seize the building on behalf of those victims. ‘The court has found that, based on the incontrovertible record evidence,’ rent money was funneled to a state-run Iranian bank, making it ‘a front for the government of Iran.’ ‘The assets at issue . . . are subject to forfeiture,’ Judge Forrest concluded. A real estate appraiser told the Daily News the building was snared at just the right time. ‘This is the best time to sell, it’s . such a hot market,’ the appraiser said, ‘[but] you know the government, . they’ll drag their feet and probably miss their chance to make a . boatload.’ Worth up to $2,000 a foot at 380,000, . the building could potentially fetch just over $700million, according to . the appraiser – making it comparable in value to the nearby General . Motors building, the Daily News noted. One of many: Ayatollah Mohammad Reza Mahdavi Kani is one of several clerics running Iran's government . Both Juicy Couture and Godiva rent ground-floor retail space. The federal government and a private group representing the families of victims of the 1993 Beirut Marine base bombing and the 9/11 terror attacks were moving to seize the building, both in an attempt to provide compensation to the victims and their families. Owned by the Alavi Foundation, the successor to the Pahlavi Foundation – which built the building and has ties to the Iranian government, 650 Fifth Avenue was constructed in 1978, according to Emporis. It sits on the southwest corner of Fifth Avenue at 52nd Street just blocks from Central Park. The US Attorney’s office in Manhattan is tops in the nation at seizing assets, according to the Daily News. With a total of $2.98billion in asset taken last year, it accounted for 68 per cent of government seizure activity nationwide, the paper noted. A call placed MailOnline to the building's listed owner, the Alavi foundation, was not answered.","Feds accused the buildings owners, a foundation with ties to the Iranian government, of funneling rent proceeds back to Iran .

"It is the mobile phone you can use in the bath or shower without fear - and can even survive being dropped down the toilet. Sony has unveiled its latest mobile phone - and hopes the waterproof design will help it take on the iPhone. The Xperia Z was unveiled at the Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas. Sony's Xperia Z handset can be dropped in water thanks to a special coating . Sony says the handset, which has a 5in (12.7cm) screen, is capable of being submerged in water of up to one metre (3.3 ft) in depth for 30 minutes. The firm says it can survive being dropped in a toilet, and if it gets dirty, can simply be washed under a tap. Sony claims that about one in 10 people had dropped their phone down a toilet at some point, something this would protect against.The trade-off is that handset's various ports, including the one for its headphones, all feature protective plastic covers that must be unclipped before they can be accessed. The handset also has an NFC chip allowing owners to play back video on their TV simply by tapping the phone against it. This chip could also be used as a credit card in the future, it is believed. MailOnline tried the new waterproof handset . The Sony Xperia Z, out in the next few weeks, is a mobile phone with a 5in screen. Apart from the Samsung Galaxy Note devices which are part-phone, part tablet, this is the biggest-screen phone yet. Even so, because it’s slim and has the narrowest of bezels round the display, it didn’t feel big. Though it sure didn’t feel small. The phone’s display has the highest resolution yet seen on a mobile – knocking the iPhone’s Retina display for six. The 5in screen had as many pixels as a 55in Full HD flatscreen TV, and it showed. The display was eye-poppingly sharp, with rich colours. Since the phone has a quad-core processor, it’s fast and responsive with no lags or stutters. This looks like it could be a real challenger to the current market leaders, the Samsung Galaxy S III and the Apple iPhone 5. It felt great, thanks to a shatterproof glass back and exceptional build quality. Other features included a high-resolution 13-megapixel camera and – handy if you tend to drop your phone in the bath – water resistance. It can be immersed in two feet of water for 30 minutes without harm. Stuart Miles, Editor-in-chief of tech website Pocket-lint.com told MailOnline: 'The Sony Xperia Z has so many features and so much going for it, . it really could be the phone to restore Sony Mobile’s fortunes.

"The woman representing Pennsylvania in the Miss USA 2014 pageant has opened up about how she was conceived when her mother was raped at knifepoint. Valerie Gatto, 24, revealed to Today.com that a man dressed in black attacked her mother when she was just 19, forcing himself upon her behind a building until a passing car spooked him, and she managed to run away. Rather than let the tragic story define her, Valerie has decided to use it as a platform to help educate women about sexual assault. 'I believe . God put me here for a reason,' she said. 'To . give [people] hope that everything is possible and you can't let your . circumstances define your life.' Tragic past: Valerie Gatto, who is representing Pennsylvania in the Miss USA 2014 pageant, has opened up about how she was conceived when her mother was raped at knifepoint . Childhood curiosity: Valerie (pictured in her very early pageant days) was six years old when she began asking about her father. Her mother told her: 'A very bad man hurt me, but God gave me you' Now, Valerie is an advocate for sexual assault awareness, traveling the country to talk to women from 18 to 30 about how to protect themselves against violence and sexual aggression. And she says winning the Miss USA crown would give her an even larger platform for spreading her message of hope and solidarity. 'I hope to show others how to be proactive, what to do, to be present, to be aware of your surroundings,' she said. 'It's so awesome to see their responses. They say it changes their life.' On her biography website, Valerie - who currently works as a marketing consultant for a periodontal practice - explains that she was six years old when she began asking questions about her absent father, whom she'd never met. Positive outlook: 'I believe God put me here for a reason,' said Valerie (pictured with her grandfather).'To give hope that everything is possible and you can't let your circumstances define your life' 'I grew up with my mom and my grandparents. They never looked at it as something negative,' she explained. Making the best of her beauty: 'Being a child of a rape, not knowing who my father is, not knowing if he's ever been found, most people would think it's such a negative situation.' World traveler: In summer 2013, Valerie spent 52 days in Europe exploring the cultures and teaching English to Italian children (pictured dancing in Rome) Finally, when she was ten, her mother told her the truth. She revealed that she didn't tell her family she was pregnant, and had every intention of putting Valerie up for adoption until the night that she was born. 'I believe God put me here for a reason, to give people hope that everything is possible' 'Valerie's mom told her family about her adoption plans; but Valerie's great-grandmother said - God doesn't give you more than you can handle,' reads the beauty queen's biography. 'Her mother listened and decided to raise Valerie with the help of God and her family.' Valerie told Today: 'Being . a child of a rape, not knowing who my father is, not knowing if he's . ever been found, most people would think it's such a negative . situation.' Exercise outfit: Valerie, who graduated from the University of Pittsburgh, at a Power Walk event . Fight for a cause: Now, Valerie is an advocate for sexual assault awareness and she says winning the Miss USA crown would give her an even larger platform for spreading her message . Staying strong: She says her family's strong Christian faith was a major factor in her positive outlook on life . On the contrary, 'I grew up with my mom and my grandparents. They never looked at it as something negative,' she explained. 'I have a loving, supportive family who told me I could be the president of the United States.' Valerie, who graduated from the University of Pittsburgh, says her family's strong Christian faith was also a major factor in her positive outlook on life. Tourist activities: Valerie has made the most of her time in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where the pageant is taking place (pictured showing off her Cajun shrimp and grits at a local restaurant) Seeing the sights: The 24-year-old beauty queen also took a break from pageant training to visit a house in Baton Rouge for high tea . Competing for the crown: The 2014 Miss USA competition will air on NBC on Sunday at 8pm ET . It also helped her mother cope with the rape. Valerie says she told her when she was a child: 'Something bad happened to me. A very bad man hurt me, but God gave me you.' 'I hope to show others how to be proactive, to be present, to be aware of your surroundings' Valerie told TribLive.com in December that even though her conception was under terrifying circumstances, she is always grateful that her mother lived through it, thanks to the bright light from the passing car, which she sees as a meaningful symbol. 'I like to think of that light as my mother's and (my) guardian angel,' she said, adding: 'She always would tell me I was her light - I am the light to illuminate the darkness for all to see.'","Miss Pennsylvania Valerie Gatto, 24, was born after her mother was raped at knifepoint at the age of 19 .

"A mechanic who beat a newborn baby to death sent a message and photos to the child’s mother suggesting everything was fine. Callous Michael Pearce, 33, offered to look after Alfie Sullock so his girlfriend could have her first night out after  giving birth six weeks earlier. But he was accused of hitting the infant with a baseball boot and bottles of bubble bath and baby powder during the 95 minutes he was alone with him. Michael Pearce (left) who has been found guilty at Newport Crown Court of killing six-week-old Alfie Rhys Sullock (right) but he was cleared of murder . A court heard the magistrate’s son . had downed five pints before babysitting for Donna Sullock, 27, . including four pints in 45 minutes at a nearby pub. Pearce was home alone babysitting Alfie last year when paramedics were called to his address in Nelson, Caerphilly, south Wales. Half . an hour into her night, she texted Pearce to check her son was alright. Pearce replied with a picture of Alfie to reassure her there was . nothing to worry about. A . trial at Newport Crown Court heard it was  the first time divorcee . Pearce had been left alone with the baby. Alfie died after suffering . head and abdominal injuries. Motorcycle mechanic Pearce was today cleared by a jury of Alfie's murder, but convicted of manslaughter. Mother Donna Sullock pictured holding her baby boy Alfie - who died in August last year while in the care of Michael John Pearce, 33 . Ms Sullock (right) broke down in tears after the jury's verdict that Pearce (left) was guilty of manslaughter . During the . trial, the defendant's counsel had queried whether Ms Sullock may have . accidentally hurt her son while getting ready and whether Alfie's . bruising was caused by medics trying to revive him. Those two claims . were both disputed in court by Alfie's mother and paramedics. Pearce, . who had drunk five pints of beer that evening, said he had 'no idea' how Alfie was injured. He said he raised the alarm after returning from . the toilet and noticing Alfie had stopped breathing. As the jury delivered its majority verdict, Ms Sullock broke down in tears. The . former holiday rep, who had clutched her son's teddy while attending . every single day of her former boyfriend's trial, later said: 'We are . disappointed at today’s verdict but satisfied he will still go to prison . for what he has done. 'Whatever sentence he gets will never be long enough for taking Alfie's life away. We have been through a year of hell. 'Thanks . to everyone for their support-friends, family, the community, people . who don’t know me have given me and my family amazing support. Rest In . Peace Alfie.' A healthy and happy Alfie was born at the University Hospital of Wales (UHW), Cardiff, on July 6, 2013, following an uneventful pregnancy. Ms Sullock, who lived in Fairwater, Cardiff, discovered she was expecting while working abroad in Crete. She returned home to the UK, and six months into her pregnancy she became friends with Pearce following a chance meeting in Fairwater. Healthy and happy: Alfie was first taken to the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil before being transferred to UHW. On August 20, life support was withdrawn and Alfie died . Donna Sullock, mother of Alfie Sullock, pictured outside Newport Crown Court . The pair later became an item, although prosecutors said Pearce began to display 'obsessive behaviour' towards her and even asked her to give him a child just weeks into their relationship. On August 16, Ms Sullock travelled from her home in the Welsh capital to Pearce's home in Nelson to stay over the weekend. However, magistrate's son Pearce suggested she go out with his friend's girlfriend for a 'girly night out'. Before then though, Pearce went out to a nearby pub and drank four pints of beer in 45 minutes. He returned home and looked after Alfie while Ms Sullock got ready. The baby's mother said her son was healthy and breathing normally before she left. Less than half an hour into her night, a worried Ms Sullock asked if her son was doing okay. The defendant sent a text saying: 'you can trust me'. He also texted her photographs of Alfie during the evening claiming it was to 'reassure' her the baby was okay. In the half an hour that followed, at 9.11pm an ambulance was called. The seven-minute call was later played to the jury in full. When asked by the operator did he see what happened, the defendant replied he had simply given the baby a bottle and then the child had stopped breathing. Earlier during the case, prosecutor Michael Mather-Lees said: 'Children do not go cold instantly.' Alfie was first taken to the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil before being transferred to UHW. On August 20, life support was withdrawn and Alfie died, the court heard. A Home Office pathologist later gave a provisional cause of death as 'blunt trauma head injury'. Following the completion of the case, Ms Sullock wished to thank family, friends as well as total strangers for their 'amazing support' during her 'year of hell'. Pearce will be sentenced at Newport Crown Court tomorrow.","Michael Pearce, from Caerphilly, bludgeoned Alfie Rhys Sullock to death .

"An eight-year-old girl was mauled to death by a circus tiger after it pulled her into its enclosure at an amusement park in China. Juan Niu was killed after sneaking away from her family to get a closer look at the tigers in a circus, and being pulled into their cage and mauled. The youngster was visiting relatives in China's south-western Chongqing Municipality with her family when they decided to visit a local amusement park after seeing posters for their new circus attraction. Pictured, tigers performing in the circus at Leheledu Amusement Park, in Chongqing city, in China . The circus tiger mauled the little girl after she entered a closed animal training site at Lehedu Amusement Park in China. Pictured, a caged Siberian tiger from China's Heilongjiang province at Beijing zoo . Leheledu Amusement Park managers had hired a travelling circus to entertain visitors and had set up temporary holding pens for the animals. She had easily walked up to the cage and managed to slip through the bars, at which point she was pounced upon by a tiger and mauled in front of horrified park visitors. Although animal trainers were quickly at the scene and pulled the child free of the animal, she was barely alive and was declared dead on arrival at a nearby hospital. The incident last week did not initially make the news after park managers offered the family compensation and promised to increase security around the animals. However, after rumours started circulating the park was forced to admit the tragedy had happened. Spokesman Manchu Hung said: 'Nothing terrible like this has ever happened before and we take the safety of our visitors very seriously. 'We will pay all compensation necessary to the family and will make sure it's not possible for anything similar to ever happen again.' A park spokesman said safety measures would be improved to prevent another incident. Pictured, the circus . A Shanghai Zoo keeper was mauled to death by this rare South China tiger last year after entering its enclosure, pictured, to clean . Last month, a nine-year-old boy had his arm torn off by a bear at a zoo in China's Henan province after he jumped past the guard rail and reached inside the cage to feed the animal. In December last year, a keeper at Shanghai zoo was mauled to death by a tiger after he entered its enclosure to clean it. Colleagues of the 56-year-old man said he went into the nine-year-old male south China tiger's enclosure and 'did not come out again'.","Juan Niu left her family to take a closer look at tigers at the theme park .

"Former deputy speaker of the House of Commons Nigel Evans has appeared in court this morning accused of a string of sex offences. Evans, 55, who was charged with two counts of indecent assault, five of sexual assault and one of rape earlier this month, spoke only to confirm his name, address and that he understands the charges during a ten minute hearing at Preston Magistrates' Court. Granted bail until a preliminary hearing at Preston Crown Court next month, Evans told reporters as he left the hearing: 'I'm going back to Westminster to work now, thank you.' Scroll down for video . Court hearing: Nigel Evans pictured arriving at Preston Magistrates Court today to face his first hearing after being charged with a string of sex offences . His bail was granted on condition he does not approach directly or indirectly named witnesses. On September 10, Evans was charged with the rape of a man between March 29 and April 1, 2013, five sexual assaults dating back to 2009 and two indecent assaults dating back to 2002. The former Conservative stood down as deputy speaker in a speech in the House of Commons the day after the charges were brought. He said he will continue to represent his Ribble Valley constituency in Lancashire but as an independent MP. The decision to charge the openly-gay politician – a popular figure in Westminster – came after he was arrested for a third time. Evans had originally said that he would . not comment further on the allegations until the case was concluded when . he appeared on the steps of Preston police station after he was . charged. Charges: MP Nigel Evans posed for photographers outside the court before telling reporters that he is 'returning to work' But in an emotional address to the Commons the following day, he told how his impending court battle was the 'most painful' experience of his life alongside the death of his mother and brother. He said: ‘Since these allegations, I have not been able to fully fulfil my duties in the chair, which left me in a land of limbo. ‘None of us were elected to the fine office of Member of Parliament to be put in that invidious position, unable to fully fulfil the reason why we were sent here.’ 'This is clearly the most painful thing I have endured in my life alongside the loss of my mother in 2009 and the loss of my brother earlier this year . First appearance: Evans is ushered into the court by a policeman this morning . ‘Winston Churchill said when you are going through hell, keep going. Sage advice. And so I will see this through to the end with the support of the people that mean so much to me.’ He had earlier said that he would 'robustly defend my innocence and seek acquittal'. Evans, from Pendleton, Lancashire, stepped aside from his deputy speaker duties after his arrest but had continued to work as an independent MP. He was one of three deputy speakers elected in a secret ballot of MPs in 2010. Later that year he came out as gay, saying he was ‘tired of living a lie’. He was a vice chairman of the Conservative Party from 1999 to 2001. When Iain Duncan Smith became party leader in 2001, he was promoted to the shadow cabinet as shadow Welsh secretary - a post he held for two years. Evans gave up the Tory whip when he became deputy speaker in 2010 and has said that he will not take the whip until 'after the conclusion of events'. District Judge Jane Goodwin adjourned . the case until October 4 when the former deputy speaker will appear for a . preliminary hearing at Preston Crown Court.

"Police swung into action when they received a phonecall telling them youths had been seen shouting at sheep. A community support officer from the cash-strapped Wiltshire force reached the scene within 30 minutes but found the sheep unharmed and no sign of the youths or the woman who had phoned. She had told police she was walking in the village of Collingbourne Ducis, near Salisbury Plain, when she saw four youths, aged 12 to 14, yelling at sheep and making them run across a field. A woman called police and said youths were yelling at sheep in the village of Collingbourne Ducis . A police spokeswoman defended the decision to send an officer, saying farmers lose livestock every year in incidents involving people whose dogs kill or maim sheep. ‘It was one of many incidents we were attending that day – not all sheep related,’ she added. Wiltshire Police face large cuts and by 2017 they will have to cut 25 per cent of their budget, reducing it by £12 million and losing 173 officers. Collingbourne parish council chairman Keith Cockerton said: ‘It is every person’s right to call the police if they feel the law is being broken.’ Wiltshire Police Headquarters - the force have defended their decision to send an officer to the incident .","A woman called police and told them youths were shouting at sheep .

"For the first time, swirls of warm water have been spotted reaching shallow regions of the seas around the Antarctic. By diving beneath the ice caps, a series of 6ft 6in-long (2 metre) yellow 'gliders' with built-in sensors have been able to track the temperature and salinity of the depths of the Weddell Sea. These measurements have revealed how vast eddies - or swirls of water - drive the heat into shallower waters, causing coastal ice to thaw. The yellow 'gliders' (pictured) measure 6ft 6in (2 metres) long, cost $240,000 (£151,300) each and feature built-in sensors that track temperature and salinity in the sea off the coast of Antarctica. These measurements have revealed how vast eddies - large swirls of water - are driving heat into shallower waters in the region . These eddies transport the warm salty water towards the Antarctic continental shelf. It is hoped that the findings, published today in the journal Nature Geoscience, will help refine ocean and climate models, so scientists can more accurately predict the rate at which ice sheets will retreat and how quickly global sea level will rise as a result. This warmer water is normally found hundreds of metres deep within the Southern Ocean, but how it reaches the shallow water around Antarctica had not been seen until now. The gliders were remotely controlled from Norwich, more than 10,000 miles (16,100km) away, and they sent data back via satellite mobile phone technology every few hours for two months. The findings confirm theories about how heat moves south, and set benchmarks to track climate change. Each of the battery-powered gliders cost $240,000 (£151,300), and can be left for months at a time, diving and surfacing with tiny adjustments to buoyancy. They were remotely controlled from Norwich, more than 10,000 miles (16,100km) away, and sent data back via satellite mobile phone technology every few hours . The UN panel of climate scientists claim both Greenland and Antarctica are losing mass and raising sea levels. The international study was led by the California Institute of Technology. Each of the battery-powered gliders cost $240,000 (£151,300), and can be left for months at a time, diving and surfacing with tiny adjustments to buoyancy. Co-author Professor Karen Heywood, from University of East Anglia's Centre for Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences, said: 'Our robots help us to build up a picture of underwater conditions by collecting data on water salinity, temperature, and oxygen levels. 'The results have identified ocean features that could not feasibly have been studied by any other means. 'A revolution is underway in Antarctic data.' These eddies transport the warm salty water towards the Antarctic continental shelf in the Weddell Sea (marked). This warmer water is normally found hundreds of metres down throughout the Southern Ocean, but how it reaches the shallow water around Antarctica had not been observed until now . It is hoped that the findings, published today in Nature Geoscience, will help refine ocean and climate models, so scientists can more accurately predict the rate at which ice sheets will retreat and how quickly global sea level will rise as a result. A ship on the ice in the Weddell Sea is pictured . 'This research was particularly challenging because the seawater quickly freezes to form sea ice and can trap the sea gliders, just like Shackleton's ship Endurance was trapped in the same area 100 years ago,' she added. One of the three gliders got lost during the study, but Professor Heywood said it still worked out cheaper than a similar trip in 2007 which required a ship costing $30,000 (£18,900) a day, with many stops, to collect less data. Elsewhere, 3,600 free drifting 'Argo floats' have been deployed worldwide since 2000 to help monitor temperatures and salinity in the seas. While rising sea levels and changing global temperatures are already known to be a consequence of climate change, the GOCE satellite has found that gravity is weakening where ice is melting the fastest. The results show that the thinning ice sheet from November 2009 to June 2012 caused local variations (pictured) An Esa satellite recently spotted an unusual consequence of the melting of ice in Antarctica. While rising sea levels and changing global temperatures are already known to be a consequence of alleged manmade climate change, the GOCE satellite - which was not intended to study the effects of a warming climate - has found that gravity is weakening where ice is melting the fastest. The results show that the thinning ice sheet from November 2009 to June 2012 caused local variations in gravity, measured by the satellite. The GOCE satellite burned up in Earth's atmosphere as planned in November 2013 after four years in orbit. During its mission it measured Earth's gravity in unprecedented detail, detailing where it was weakest and strongest on the surface. In the air, drones have also been used by organisations such as Nasa to monitor ice. Katharina Nygaard, of manufacturer Kongsberg's subsea division, estimated the firm had a quarter of a world market of 800 gliders. Demand 'is growing in the marine research world along with small but noticeable uptake by defence and commercial operators,' she said. In the Arctic, gliders are tracking higher temperatures that are driving fish stocks north. 'We've moved from prototypes to the more regular use of gliders in the last year,' said Peter Haugan, professor at the University of Bergen in Norway.","The 'gliders' measure 6ft 6in (2 metres) and cost $240,000 (£151,300) each .

"A monkey was mauled by a bear after a disturbing circus stunt went wrong. A video has emerged online of two monkeys and a black bear being forced to ride bicycles around a track in front of a large crowd. After two laps of the track, one of the monkeys crash and the bear then attacks it as it lies stuck under the bicycle. Scroll down for video: Warning graphic content . The two monkeys and the bear are put on the bikes before being shooed off by staff holding sticks . Crowds can be heard cheering and laughing as the animals ride around the small arena . The gruesome video is believed to have been shot at the Shanghai Wild Animal Park, in China, which has hit the headlines in the past for its 'Wild Animal Olympics'. In the video, the audience can be heard cheering and laughing as the animals are sent riding around the small arena. Circus workers holding sticks push the small bikes off but after a few seconds one monkey and the bear crash. Staff can be seen desperately trying to force the bear off as it grabs the small monkey in its mouth. At one stage three workers, dressed in brightly coloured costumes, try to wrestle the bear away, while another leads the second monkey away. The animals crash into one another after one of the monkeys falls from its bike after about two laps . Campaign group Animals Asia said it has previously documented cheetahs, lions, tigers, bears, chimpanzees and an elephant being forced to perform in the 'Wild Animal Olympics'. It is not clear when the latest video was taken but Shanghai Wild Animal Park said in 2006 that the Olympic event had been scrapped following complaints and 'out of consideration for the safety of our visitors.' Stunts in the show had included making bears box one another and ride bicycles, kangaroos boxing humans and monkeys lifting weights. Visitors to the park can also pay to have their picture taken with the big cats and other animals. Animals Asia said some of the creatures had also been declawed. China Tour Online's website said the park 'offers animal performances, showing the charm and skill of the animals and their gift in performing.' The bear then attacks the animal lying under the bike in front of the shocked animal park crowd . Despite the frantic efforts of the zoo staff who hit the bear with sticks, it continues to maul the monkey .","A video is believed to have been filmed at Shanghai Wild Animal Park .

"Hours before his final game for the red, white and blue, Landon Donovan made no effort to hide his anger at Jurgen Klinsmann. The face of American 'soccer' for more than a decade, Donovan had been counting on going to his fourth World Cup. And then after practice at Stanford Stadium on May 22, Klinsmann called in the 32-year-old forward and told him he wasn't going to Brazil. Donovan was stunned and livid. He recorded commercials poking fun at his exclusion, criticised Klinsmann's tactics during the tournament and was reluctant to accept an offer from USA Soccer Federation Sunil Gulati to play a celebratory finale for the national team. Ultimately, Donovan accepted and was set to make his 157th international appearance in an exhibition against Ecuador on Friday night. Landon Donovan of USA takes to the field during warm-ups on Friday ahead of his 157th international . The face of American 'soccer' for more than a decade, Donovan thought he was going to his fourth World Cup . Donovan still says he 'didn't agree with the decision and I still know I should have been there' in Brazil . Looking back, Donovan thinks getting axed benefited him in an unexpected manner. 'Although I didn't agree with the decision and I still know I should have been there, it was also good for me to say, you know what, it's not always going to go your way,' he said. 'And it took time for me to get to that place. I'm human. I had some very real emotions after. But after a while I said: Maybe this is a going to be a good thing. And I wouldn't have the opportunity to grow had it not happened. I certainly grew a lot more by that happening than if I had gone to the World Cup and played there, and in that way you can learn a lot from it. 'I had the opportunity to feel what other players have felt in my career. A lot of times when I made a team I was so happy for me that I forgot about the guy who got cut, so for the first time it kind of put that in front of my face.' Gulati sat at Donovan's side during a half-hour pregame news conference on ESPN's 'Baseball Tonight' set, about 20 miles from Rentschler Field, and maintained his refusal to comment on Klinsmann's decision. Without Donovan, the USA advanced from a difficult first-round group by defeating Ghana, drawing Portugal and losing against Germany. The Americans were knocked out with a 2-1 extra time loss against Belgium, and Friday's match was their first at home since leaving Brazil. 'Three, four months ago, if someone asked if this day would happen, I would have said you're out of your mind and you're crazy,' Donovan said. 'I give all the credit to Sunil for sticking with me through some hard conversations and understanding what was important and making it happen. 'I believe this is a day I deserve. I believe this is a day my family deserves for all the sacrifices they've made.' Donovan anticipated 20 family members would attend, and he said the USSF had treated them 'like kings and queens' this week. It helped to alleviate some of his vexation. Donovan reacts as he speaks about his retirement from football during a press conference on Friday . 'People forget, for those of us who weren't selected this summer to play in Brazil, it's not only difficult for us, it's difficult for our families,' he said. 'In many instances, our families had this amazing vacation trip of a lifetime planned, and that was taken from them.' The LA Galaxy forward, the American career leader in international goals (57) and assists (58), is retiring at the end of the Major League Soccer season. Donovan played in all 12 USA games at the 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cups, scoring an American-record five goals. His stoppage-time winner against Algeria four years ago gave the USA first place in its group for the first time in 80 years and created one of America's iconic moments. Asked about his relationship with Klinsmann, all Donovan would say is: 'You know.' It took him a while to accept Gulati's offer of a testimonial match. 'The thought of being in this environment again didn't seem all that appealing at the time,' Donovan said. 'But at the end of the day I looked at the big picture and realized what a special day this could be. It's almost like, if you care to believe this stuff, in many ways it's meant to be. I think it's no coincidence it's 10-10 today.' Donovan took over the No 10 jersey following captain Claudio Reyna's retirement in 2006. But for all Donovan's accomplishments, Klinsmann said Thursday he wished Donovan 'could have done a bit more' and established a career with a European club rather than remain in MLS. Donovan played in 12 games at the 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cups, scoring an American-record five goals . LA Galaxy forward Donovan announced he is retiring at the end of the Major League Soccer season . 'I think it's easy for people to judge others in their career choices and their life choices,' Donovan said. 'I've always tried to make decisions that were best for me and best for my family and best for my happiness. I realize that's not always popular with people. I'm sure a lot of people wish my career had gone a different way.' Donovan took a four-month sabbatical from football after the 2012 season, a decision that strained his relationship with Klinsmann, who believes top players should train virtually year-round. Donovan needed time away - he has been open about his struggles with depression. 'It's human nature to have sad periods in life,' he said. 'I would much rather feel than not feel things and to go through some of the things we as human beings go through. It's normal to feel that way.' He's not quite sure what awaits. Attending college and travel are among the possibilities. He'll remain involved with the USSF, but how he's not sure. Coaching intrigues him, but not pros. Perhaps the under-17 team, the level where he first gained world-wide attention in 1999. 'I wouldn't want to deal with male soccer egos. That's a headache that I think nobody would want, even though some coaches take it on,' he said. 'I think being able to really be hands on early in people's careers would be helpful, because that's where I needed the most help.'","LA Galaxy forward Landon Donovan has been a big part of American 'soccer' and is retiring at the end of the Major League Soccer season .

"Didier Drogba is poised to take a step closer to realising his dream of a return to Chelsea this week. Talks have been ongoing over a one year player-coach contract which will see the 36-year-old Stamford Bridge idol reunited with mentor Jose Mourinho. Drogba is understood to have already texted some of his former Chelsea teammates to hint at his return. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Didier Drogba's hilarious fight with Jens Lehman . Legend: Mourinho (left) brought Drogba to the club in 2004 from Marseille, and his faith paid off . Elsewhere: The 36-year-old has interest from clubs in Qatar while Juventus continue to flirt with the idea . Chelsea have wanted to lower the age of their playing squad but recognise the significant contribution Drogba can still make to the club on and off the pitch. His experience and winning mentality can influence those around him while he has the ability to make an impact from the bench as he provides cover for main striker Diego Costa. Chelsea have spent well this summer and will continue to add but have lost Samuel Eto'o and Demba Ba while Romelu lukaku could yet join Everton despite initially being recalled into the fold. A player-coach contract though would also fall more comfortably into Financial Fair Play guidelines as part of his wages would be absorbed into the coaches budget. Drogba first signed for Chelsea ten years ago and left in 2012. To confirm his departure, Drogba told the club's official website: 'I wanted to put an end the speculation and confirm that I am leaving Chelsea. It has been a very difficult decision for me to make and I am very proud of what we have achieved. But the time is right for a new challenge for me. As a team we have accomplished so much and have won every single trophy possible.' Milking the applause: Drogba shows his appeciation to the fans during his last game at Stamford Bridge in blue . Journeyman: Spells at Shaghai Shenua and Galatasaray followed Drogba's Chelsea departure . VIDEO Drogba weighs up Chelsea return . He returned last season as an opponent in the Champions League with Galatasaray and was presented with a thank you gift of a silver boot on behalf of the club. His return will be welcomed by supporters and will strengthen Mourinho's position within the club. Yet fans will still be demanding another, younger striker or that Chelsea keep Lukaku. Much will depend though if the Belgian is willing to play second fiddle to Costa and Everton are poised with an offer to give him the starting place he demands. Meanwhile, Chelsea are sending new signing Mario Pasalic out on loan to Elche for the 2014/15 season. The Croatia Under-21 midfielder spoke to 24sata about the move revealing: 'As I went to say goodbye to my manager Jose Mourinho, he told me that I'm on the best way to one day return to Chelsea. 'He also told me that I must do my best on loan in Spain because he will keep track of all my games. Director of sport Michael Emenalo also told me that he and Mourinho will come to see me in Spain. I like this option from Elche... I always dreamed that I would play in La Liga once.' Return?

"Geologists have attacked Iain Duncan Smith’s claim that they are less ‘important’ than supermarket shelf stackers. The Work and Pensions Secretary issued the rebuke after geology graduate Cait Reilly won a landmark court case against the Government’s back-to-work scheme, which involved work experience at Poundland. He said: ‘The next time these smart people who say there’s something wrong with this go into their supermarket, ask themselves this simple question. Professor Alan Lord, left, said he would be surprised if Iain Duncan Smith, right, though geologists were any less 'than equally vital to the economy as those who stack shelves' ‘When they can’t find the food on the shelves, who is more important: Them, the geologist, or the person that stacked the shelf?’ Now the Geological Society of London has voiced its ‘surprise’ at the minister’s comments. Professor Alan Lord, the society’s secretary for foreign and external affairs, responded: ‘Without geologists, there would be no way to supply supermarkets with produce, no transport for customers or staff – no shelves, in fact. ‘Geologists are a vital part of that supply chain – mining the minerals essential for fertilisers, obtaining metal ores, discovering the fuel which transports produce to the store, and engineering our transport infrastructure. ‘We would be surprised if Mr Duncan Smith considered geology graduates anything less than equally vital to the economy as those who stack shelves. Geology student Cait Reilly won a landmark case against the Government's back-to-work scheme . ‘Many geologists spend a lot of time . in challenging conditions - on oil rigs in the North Sea, in trenches . and mines, conducting field work in all weathers. The Appeal Court ruling last week found the Government’s regulations failed to give claimants enough information, particular regarding sanctions they would face if they refused to work under the scheme. But the court rejected the claim by Miss Reilly, who is from Birmingham, that being forced to do unpaid work experience was a breach of her human rights. The 24-year-old said she was not objecting to doing menial work but to not being paid for it. She is now working part-time in a supermarket.","The Work and Pensions Secretary said geologists are not as 'important'

"The 5.5-metre crocodile pictured with a bull shark between its jaws a few days ago has made international headlines and become a reptilian celebrity. But this is not the first time the 80-year-old two-tonne beast called Brutus, has attracted international attention. Photographs of him lifting his two-tonne frame out of the Adelaide River in the Northern Territory to gnaw at some kangaroo meat during a 'jumping crocodile' tour made headlines in 2011. The giant crocodile is known on the river tours for his huge size and the fact that he is missing his right foreleg – believed to have been torn off in a fight with a shark. Scroll down for video . This is the moment a 5.5 metre crocodile named Brutus latched onto a bull shark in the Northern Territory on Tuesday . Brutus, the 5.5-metre crocodile who is believed to be 80 years old first made international headlines when he was snapped in this 2011 photo (left) 'We get a lot of requests about Brutus,' said Harry Bowman from Adelaide River Cruises. 'We get many phone calls, are you the one who has Brutus? Have we got the right tour to see Brutus? You could say he's a local celebrity.' 'He's been with us for quite a few years, we can't guarantee that he'll come out at every cruise, but he makes appearances pretty regularly.' Brutus's appeal, he says is his 'sheer size and the fact he's missing a leg.' When tourists see him 'they're pretty awed', said Mr Bowman. 'It's pretty gobsmacking for them. A lot of people who come on these cruises haven't seen a crocodile before. To see them in the wild up so close, I think they're awed. It's like seeing a dinosaur really, that's what a lot of them say.' The crocodile attracted international attention when pictures emerged of him eating a shark on Tuesday. The photograph was snapped by Sydney man Andrew Paice who was on a cruise down Kakadu's Adelaide River on Tuesday with his partner Nikki and seven-year-old daughter Madison. 'The tour guide had Brutus jumping at some meat the first time we went past him. Brutus is quite well known up here… he jumps really high for an old crocodile,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'We were near the end of the tour and we'd fed all of the crocodiles along the river. We were on our way back to the jetty when we saw (the crocodile) had something in his mouth.' Brutus the crocodile has been a key attraction on river cruises in the Northern Territory for years, with many people calling up Adelaide River Cruises to see whether they'll get to see the famous beast . It is believed that Brutus lost his right leg in a fight with a shark years ago, although he clearly came out the winner in his fight with a bull shark on Tuesday . The tour guide, Morgan from Adelaide River Cruises, backed the boat back just as Brutus the crocodile was on the river bank with the shark in its mouth. 'The shark was definitely alive... it was still wriggling. The crocodile slid back into the water and the shark started to flip around a bit. The the crocodile swam into the mangroves, I guess to protect his catch,' Mr Paice said. 'I never even thought about a crocodile catching a shark before. It was absolutely amazing to see. Everyone was astonished. I was amazed I even caught it on camera.' Mr Paice, who lives in Sydney, is four months into a year long trip around Australia with his partner and daughter. 'There's some amazing sites to see up here. To see the jumping crocodiles was pretty amazing but then to see this... I think it will be pretty hard to top,' he said. They have already travelled through Queensland and are now part way through the Northern Territory, before they head down into Western Australia. Brutus the killer crocodile is believed to be around 80 years old - and has a front leg missing which he is believed to have lost during a fight with a shark. Brutus the crocodile has been a key attraction on river cruises in the Northern Territory for years, with many people calling up Adelaide River Cruises to see whether they'll get to see the famous beast .

"Some experts claim the male Y chromosome (pink) is on the way out. Yet DNA analysis has found a small set of unique genes have remained for 200 million years . Not only is the male chromosome here to stay - following exaggerated reports of its demise - it also plays a much wider role than first thought. Researchers from Massachusetts have discovered that despite its decay, the Y chromosome has preserved a small set of genes over millions of years that have ensured the survival of men. And most have little, if any, role in sex determination or sperm production, according to the study. Instead, they have been discovered to play a vital role in determining the differences between the sexes in terms of health and disease. The findings, published in the journal Nature, suggest these Y-linked genes could be contributing to differences in how susceptible the different sexes are to disease, and how severely it affects them. Professor David Page, of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Massachusetts, said: ‘This paper tells us not only is the Y chromosome here to stay but we need to take it seriously - and not just in the reproductive tract. ‘There are approximately a dozen genes conserved on the Y, expressed in cells and tissue types throughout the body. ‘These are genes involved in decoding and interpreting the entirety of the genome. How pervasive their effects are is a question we throw open to the field - and it's one we can no longer ignore.’ He said his research will allow his . lab to change from proving the so-called 'rotting Y theorists' wrong. Using DNA analysis, stock image pictured, researchers discovered that  most of the remaining genes have little, if any, role in sex determination or sperm production. Instead, they have been discovered to play a vital role in determining the differences between the sexes in terms of health and disease . Prior . to 200 million years ago, when mammals were still relatively new on . Earth, early versions of the X and Y sex chromosomes existed as . interactive pairs. With each generation, they swapped a few genes so that offspring were a genetic mix of their parents. Then . the gene for male features became fixed on the Y chromosome, and . attracted other male-specific genes such as those controlling . development of the testes, sperm and semen. Many . of these turned out to be harmful for females, so the X and Y stopped . swapping genes and started to evolve separately. Today women have a . matched pair of X chromosomes while men have an XY pair. Because the X and Y cannot swap genes it is more difficult for mistakes in the Y chromosome to be corrected. This has made it more sensitive to natural selection, and led to its degradation over time, scientists believe. The . belief was based on claims the chromosome's 1,400 genes had fallen in . number to just 45 in the last 300 million years and this would carry on . until it disappeared - making men extinct. Over the past decade Professor Page and colleagues have been debunking this argument. The . loss of content on the Y is not in dispute, and Professor Page's own . lab has found the chromosome retains only 19 of over 600 genes it once . shared with its partner - the female X chromosome. But by comparing . the sequence of the human Y with that of the chimpanzee and the rhesus . macaque, the researchers discovered the chromosome has lost only one ancestral gene . over the past 25 million years. The . latest study maps the evolution of the Y chromosomes of five more . distantly-related mammals - the marmoset, mouse, rat, bull and opossum. This . revealed a set of broadly expressed genes across all eight species - . and such stability and conservation is no accident with each having a . counterpart on the X. Professor Page explained: ‘This is not just a random sampling of the Y's ancestral repertoire. This is an elite bunch of genes.’ Lab . researcher Dr Winston Bellott added evolution is telling us these genes . are really important for survival because they've been selected and . purified over time. The next step will be to determine what this set . of Y genes is actually doing, which is not yet clear. Cells in females . which have two X chromosomes, and are referred to as XX, are subtly but . fundamentally different from male XYs. By comparing the sequence of the human Y chromosome with that of the chimpanzee, stock image pictured, and the rhesus macaque, the researchers discovered the chromosome has lost only one ancestral gene over the past 25 million years . And they vary throughout the body in tissues and organs that show no obvious anatomic differentiation. Dr Bellott said: ‘They're similar, but biologically different. ‘Yet we have cell biologists and biochemists actively studying cells without any idea whether the cells are XX or XY. This is so fundamental to biology and biomedicine - and yet no one's really paid much attention to it.’ The . researchers said what's needed is a biochemical catalogue of the . differences between XX and XY cells - including variability in such . processes as gene expression and protein production. Professor Page said this pursuit could have enormous implications for human health. Dr Bellot continued: ‘There's a clear need to move beyond a unisex model of biomedical . research - which means we need to move beyond a unisex model of our . understanding and treatment of disease.’","Previous research claimed men could be extinct in five million years .
This is because the male chromosome Y has a small range of unique genes .
It's also lost 90% of genes it used to share with the female X chromosome .
Other chromosomes, by comparison, have thousands of unique genes .
By comparing the human Y sequence with a chimpanzee's, researchers found it lost just one ancestral gene in the past 25 million years .
They also found it plays a role in determining health differences between  the sexes ."
"Prince Harry confessed tonight he missed his role as an Apache helicopter pilot and would like to return to flying in the future. The fourth in line to the throne, who quit the Army Air Corps in January for a desk job organising military events including the Invictus Games for wounded warriors, reminisced about his time in Aghanistan with veterans of the conflict at a Buckingham Palace reception. 'He said he enjoyed the flying and he missed it,' said Flight Sergeant Lee Renard, a veteran of three tours of duty in Iraq and 11 in Afghanistan between 2006 and 2014. Scroll down for video . Reminiscing: Prince Harry spoke to fellow Afghanistan veterans about his time as an Apache helicopter pilot . Recognition: Prince William, pictured with servicemen and women, hosted the event with his brother . Royal reception: The Buckingham Palace event was also attended by the Queen and the Duke of York . Another Afghanistan veteran, Flight Lieutenant Lance Levin, a Chinook helicopter pilot from 27 Squadron, RAF Odiham, said: 'He said he enjoys his flying and would like to return at some point.' There has been speculation that Harry, 30, a Captain in the Household Cavalry, might return to flying Apaches after he finishes his current posting. However, royal sources have so far suggested that is unlikely, although they have not ruled out the Prince doing some other role involving flying. The Prince loved his five-month posting to Afghanistan in winter 2012-13 where he served as a top gun co-pilot, often providing top cover for medical evacuations. But he did not enjoy the social side of life on base at Wattisham, Suffolk. As an Apache pilot, it was his regular job to provide cover from above as the teams retrieved casualties from the battlefield, often under enemy fire. Paramedic Sgt Kevin McClean, 35, from Carrickfergus, Co Antrim, said: 'They were our support helicopter. My job was to get to the casualty, with four gunners from air force protection and do the triage and get them onto the helicopter. It was good to have the Apache pilots providing top cover, particularly if we were under fire.' At Buckingham Palace on Thursday night, Prince Harry and his brother Prince William were joined by the Queen, the Duke of York and Princess Alexandra at a reception for 400 guests to thank those who have supported wounded, injured and sick service personnel. It was William and Harry's idea to celebrate the role played by medical, military and civilian specialists who have helped the wounded warriors on their path to recovery. Among the guests at the palace were those who were saved by the bravery and quick actions of their comrades and the medics. Giving thanks: The event honoured those who have supported wounded, injured and sick service personnel . Welcome: Prince William looked relaxed as he spoke to guests at the reception at Buckingham Palace . Taking to the air: Prince Harry said that he would like to return to flying 'at some point' in his career . Former Royal Marine Mark Ormrod, 31, from Plymouth, became the first British triple amputee of the Afghan conflict, losing both legs and an arm, when he stepped on an improvised explosive device in 2007. Now a motivational speaker and successful businessman, he said he had never thought about just how many people had been involved in helping him in his recovery until he arrived at the reception, in the palace state apartments. Paying tribute to them all, he said: 'I've never actually thought about it until I came here tonight.' Aides said Prince Harry, who took the desk job specifically to organise the first Invictus Games, a highly acclaimed international event for wounded military veterans that took place in London in September, remained focused for the moment on his current job organising events. He would normally be expected to spend at least two years in his current post and it is understood that no decision has yet been taken on what the Prince, who is expected to be promoted to Major at some point in the near future, will do next.","Prince Harry reminisced about his time in Afghanistan with veterans .

Speaking at a conference last week, she said: ‘They weren’t interested. I realised that for them, a toy which involves following instructions just doesn’t cut it any more.’ Labour MP Stella Creasy (pictured) claimed that children were no longer interested in Lego toys after her young nieces and nephews refused to build a Lego Death Star from the Star Wars films .

"Sierra Leone cyclist Mohamed Tholley is 'not missing' and his chef de mission knows his whereabouts, a Games spokesman has sai . A Sierra Leone cyclist who 'vanished' from the Commonwealth Games in an apparent bid to avoid going back to his Ebola-stricken country has been found - but several of his teammates do not want to return home. The plea from the athletes was made as Sierra Leone sportstars failed to turn up for four separate events, sparking fears that even more of the country's athletes could be going missing. It comes as the World Health Organisation issued a warning about the epidemic of Ebola in West Africa - which they now say has killed more than 700 people in four countries. Unisa Deen Kargbo, chef de mission of the country's team, says his athletes are scared about returning to Sierra Leone, amid fears they will be struck down by the killer disease. Mr Kargbo also said he would be 'investigating' why the athletes had not turned up at the various events - because he had expected them to be there. He told the Times: 'Many people are thinking whether or . not to go home now. Everybody is worried and many of them don't want to . go home now because of the Ebola. 'We . have held several meetings with them, but they are still worried. This . virus is spreading around our country and everyone is at risk of . catching it.' Yesterday, Mohamed Tholley, the country's mountain biking champion allegedly failed to turn . up to Thursday's time trial. Officials admitted they were concerned he was trying to abscond, to avoid returning to Sierra Leone. Today, a spokesman for Glasgow 2014 said he was 'not missing' and the chef de mission knew his whereabouts. But yesterday, Sierra Leone’s men’s and women’s 4x400m . relay teams also mysteriously withdrew from first round heats at . Hampden Park. The men's 4x100 team also did not run. Organisers were apparently given no explanation. Asked about the non-appearance, a Games spokesman said: ‘I don’t know.’ There have now been four events - including the time trial of Mr Tholley - which Sierra Leone’s athletes have entered but not started. Mr . Kargbo said: ‘I was at . Hampden Park expecting to see the boys and girls in the relay. I don’t know where they are. I am going back to the village to find out what has happened.’ He was not available for comment when MailOnline tried to contact him about the missing athletes today. Scroll down for video . According to the chef de mission of the team, members of the Sierra . Leone delegation, pictured here at the opening ceremony, do not want to return home because of fears they will . catch the Ebola virus . Chef de mission of Sierra Leone's Commonwealth Team Unisa Deen Kargbo, . pictured right meeting the Queen at the Games, made the comments earlier today . But he added today that he was determined to get his athletes home, saying: 'Athletes have come to me and . said they don't want to return because of the Ebola situation. 'There . have been discussions with back home to see what the final decision will . be on that. I have a mandate to return the athletes on 5 August and that's what I'm working towards now.' Asked if the athletes could stay on in the UK, he said: 'The UK government will have to decide if that's an option, but I don't know.' The drama in the Sierra Leone camp came after it was revealed . earlier this week that cyclist Moses Sesay, 32, had been admitted to a Glasgow . hospital and tested for various conditions, including Ebola. The Ebola virus is fatal in 90 per cent of cases and there is no vaccine and no known cure. The team coach Winston Crowther . also last night revealed that a second team member, table tennis player . Samuel Morris, 34, had spent four days being tested in isolation. Both were tested negative for the disease. But . cyclist Mr Sesay, 32, said: ‘I am scared to be going back because it is . very difficult, people are frightened of Ebola. ‘We . are supposed to leave just after the competition but I don’t know. On . our passports we have three month visas. All of us are scared of . returning. If I have the opportunity I will stay here for a while . because of Ebola.’ Teammate Jimmy Thoronka, 20, a sprinter, said he, too, wanted to extend his visa after learning his uncle had contracted Ebola. ‘My visa is until September but I want to stay longer,’ he said. ‘We are safe here and it’s dangerous there.’ Cyclist Moses Sesay was isolated for four days in Glasgow while he was tested for a number of conditions, including Ebola . Mr Sesay had also said yesterday he believed . Mr Tholley had left without even competing because he . was afraid of Ebola and did not want to return home. He said many of the 26 Sierra Leone athletes in Scotland shared his missing friend’s fears. Meanwhile, Commonwealth Games . Federation admitted it had no idea where Mr Tholley had gone because a spokesman said it . had not been reported to them. The spokesman said the village was very big and many athletes sometimes left the village to 'go shopping or to visit Grandma in Edinburgh'. He . added that most athletes had visas which went beyond the competition, meaning they were legally allowed to remain in the UK for some time . - and therefore the CGF could not always keeps tabs on their whereabouts. He said: 'There is not an awful lot we can do, or say, about the situation.' At the London 2012 Olympics, 82 athletes, coaches and officials claimed political asylum. Police admitted last year that they were still looking for 21 people who had vanished after the Games. But Jackie Brock-Doyle, a spokeswoman . for Glasgow 2014, said it would not be possible for the athletes to stay . on in the village, even if they wanted to. She . said: 'The athletes' village closes on Wednesday and is being . decommissioned on Thursday, so it will become a building site within a . matter of hours. The Ebola crisis has been blamed for 729 deaths in an outbreak in four west African countries, including Sierra Leone. Here, two medics are seen carrying an Ebola patient in Kailahun, Sierra Leone . 'We had a . meeting with the chef de mission this morning and all his plan to take . his entire team back to Sierra Leone on their flight on Tuesday still . stands.' Speaking about those who had been tested for Ebola, a spokesman added: 'Glasgow 2014 adheres to patient confidentiality in all medical matters and cannot discuss individual cases. 'Following reports to media from members of the Sierra Leone team, we can confirm two athletes from Sierra Leone were tested for Ebola as part of a series of tests undertaken last week when they presented as unwell. Both tested negative for Ebola.' After . this year's London marathon, a runner from Sierra Leone, 24-year-old . Mami Konneh Lahun, went missing after finishing the race in 20th place. She failed to turn up at an airport when she was due to fly home, but police later found her safe and well. Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness, that affects humans as well as primates, including monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees. The virus is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. A plane carrying one of two U.S. aid workers infected with the deadly Ebola virus has left Liberia for the United States, a spokesperson for the charity Samaritan's Purse said on Saturday. The plane was carrying Dr. Kent Brantly, the spokesperson said, but could not provide a time for its arrival in the United States. The second Samaritan's Purse staff member, missionary Nancy Writebol, is due to be transported on a later flight, as the plane is only equipped to carry one patient at a time. The charity said on Friday the medical evacuations should be completed by early next week. Once a person becomes infected, the disease can spread through contact with a sufferer's blood, urine, saliva, stools and semen. Sesay was given the all clear and . released from hospital in time to compete in the men's individual time . trial at the Games on Thursday. The father of one, who competed in the Games on his 32nd birthday, finished last in his race. He had arrived in Glasgow among a . team of two dozen competitors and officials the week before the Games . and felt unwell last Thursday, the day after he attended the Opening . Ceremony. ‘All of us are scared about going back,' he said. 'We . have a three-month visa in our passports and if I have the opportunity, I . will stay here until it ends. ‘It is scary over there. My mother is a medical nurse so she may have to treat people.  My wife is also doing work in the medical field.’ Meanwhile table tennis player Mr . Morris spoke of his illness. He said: ‘The doctor told me I am free from . Ebola. They did the test. They kept me for three or four days, I was . really sick. After the tests, one or two days later they let me out.’ At the games today three athletes who have made as many headlines outside the Glasgow 2014 stadiums as they have for their sporting prowess will compete for Commonwealth glory today. Usain Bolt is appearing in a final of the men's athletics, after leading Jamaica to victory in the qualifying heats at Hampden last night. The much-anticipated appearance of the world's fastest man has been overshadowed by controversial comments attributed to him in The Times newspaper, in which he reportedly said the games were 'a bit s***' and he was 'not really' having fun in Scotland. The six-time Olympic champion made his Commonwealth Games debut after he missed the event in Melbourne in 2006 through injury and opted to skip the 2010 Games in Delhi. Diver Tom Daley will be back in action in the men's 10m final after coming agonisingly close to Commonwealth Games gold in the synchronised event last night after a near-perfect final dive which left Daley and teammate James Denny settling for silver.","Mohamed Tholley reportedly failed to turn up at event to avoid going home .

"Jeff Hunter's body was discovered in the luxury unit he rented in Miraflores, Lima . The death of an Australian mining executive who was found dead in his apartment in Peru surrounded by drugs is now the subject of a murder investigation. Jeff Hunter's body was discovered in the luxury unit he rented in Miraflores, Lima, with a plastic bag on his head, after he had spent the night with three women. Two women and one man have been arrested but have yet to be formally charged. By law, police have 15 days to investigate. During this time, they keep all suspects in a holding cell until the charges are formalised in front of a judge by the prosecution. Initial reports from local media said police had ruled the 54-year-old's death a suicide after finding no signs of violence on his body. It is believed he died of asphyxia. But Daily Mail Australia understands that local homicide police are conducting the investigation. Mr Hunter's body was discovered by his housekeeper who knocked on the door with no answer and then called a locksmith. His safe was reportedly found open with his laptop and mobile phone missing. Mr Hunter lived in a high-class neighbourhood overlooking the ocean. A doorman in the building, who did not wish to be named, told Daily Mail Australia: 'When they opened the door, something very personal was discovered. 'If I had to say I am surprised this happened to him, I would be lying and you'd be terribly disappointed to hear something that is contrary to what you want to believe.' Initial reports from local media said police had ruled the 54-year-old's death a suicide but Daily Mail Australia understands that local homicide police are conducting the investigation . Mr Hunter was working in Lima as health and safety manager at Peruvian mining company STRACON GyM . Mr Hunter was working in Lima as health and safety manager at Peruvian mining company STRACON GyM. He worked at a mine in Mt Carlton, Queensland, in 2012 and had previously lived in Charters Towers, near Townsville. Over the past decade he also worked for companies in China, Ghana, Laos and Jamaica. His sister Wendy Hunter-Carter, who lives in Townsville along with Mr Hunter's mother and daughter, posted about his death on social media, the Townsville Bulletin reported. 'To let you all know that Jeff Hunter has sadly passed away September, 2014,' she wrote. 'Much loved husband, father, son, brother and uncle.' It is expected that his body will be flown back to Australia. STRACON GyM released a statement following his death: 'The company has been in contact with Jeff's family in Australia and the Australian Embassy here in Lima, to ensure appropriate steps are taken and support provided to Jeff's family. Our thoughts are with Jeff's family and friends at this sad time.' Mr Hunter's former colleagues told the Bulletin he left Australia in 'mysterious circumstances' in 2012 claiming he was being followed by the Japanese mafia.","Mystery surrounds the death of an Australian mining executive Jeff Hunter .

"Commons Speaker John Bercow has confirmed Westminster’s worst-kept secret: he can be ‘bumptious and pompous’. His frank admission comes in the final episode of Inside The Commons, the BBC2 fly-on-the-wall documentary. The programme, by respected political documentary maker Michael Cockerell, to be broadcast on Tuesday, focuses on Mr Bercow’s stormy clashes with MPs in the Commons. Confession: John Bercow, left, makes the admission in the final episode of Inside The Commons, which also covers his reportedly fraught relationship with ex-Commons Clerk Sir Robert Rogers (right) who quit last year . It also covers his reportedly fraught relationship with ex-Commons Clerk Sir Robert Rogers who quit last year after allegedly being told to ‘f*** off’ by the Speaker. In this week’s documentary, alongside clips of Mr Bercow berating misbehaving MPs, Mr Cockerell says: ‘Many MPs say John Bercow is his own worst enemy because of his manner.’ The Speaker admits: ‘Some critics say I’m bumptious and can be pompous. If people say that, there may be truth in it.’ He defends efforts to modernise the Commons, saying: ‘It’s not possible to make an omelette without breaking eggs.’ Insight: The programme, by respected political documentary maker Michael Cockerell, to be broadcast on Tuesday, focuses on Mr Bercow’s stormy clashes with MPs in the Commons (pictured) But he admits he ‘lost’ his battle last year to replace Sir Robert with Australian parliamentary administrator Carol Mills amid protests she knew nothing about Commons procedure. Her appointment was blocked after a revolt by senior MPs. Mr Bercow says: ‘There will be people who say, “the Speaker lost”. Well, that is undeniable. She has not been appointed.’","Mr Bercow makes frank admission in final episode of Inside The Commons .

"With Hurricane Irene bearing down on the East Coast, thousands of people face fleeing their homes. But, as ever, there is one group of intrepid individuals heading straight for eye of the storm - the weathermen. As a reminder to us all, TV stations and blogs have compiled a series of clips which remind us that the job of forecasting the weather can have dangers of its own. Scroll down for videos . Unfortunate location: Hurricane Wilma forced Jeff Morrow to his knees as he attempted to report from Miami in October 2005, for the Weather Channel . On NBC’s Morning Joe, viewers were shown a highlight reel of bloopers, clangers and mistakes which showed how even seasoned weather reporters are not immune from on-air issues. One of the clips shows an unidentified weatherman swear live on air when some lightning flashes across the sky. ‘Son of a...!’ he says, oblivious to the fact he is still on camera. ‘Did you see that?’ In other footage a weather girl shrieks when her cap is blown off and runs after it whilst still on air. Fail: NBC's Al Roker fell over in 2005 during severe gusts from Hurricane Wilma in Naples, Florida, despite a colleague grabbing his legs to keep him steady . Almost blown away: This weather reporter in Columbia River Gorge struggles to hold onto her thermal hat as she is battered by strong winds . And another clip shows a weather girl being held up by a colleague as wind batters them both. She tells viewers: ‘It’s just painful’ - before they are both swept away. Among the most famous weather ‘fails’ is that of NBC’s Al Roker, who fell over on camera due to high winds. In a clip from 2005 he at first seems to be coping with the gusts from Hurricane Wilma in Naples, Florida with the aid of a colleague grabbing his legs to keep him steady. Hats off: This reporter in Palm Springs remarks about a fallen traffic light before she loses her hat and hilariously runs after it with her back to the camera . Sea breeze: This reporter amazingly escapes unharmed while there is debris blowing all around him as he reports on Hurricane Ike . But moments into the broadcast he slips up and falls on his side. ‘We’re OK, we’re OK,’ he said as he hauled himself indoors with a grin on his face. The year before Mr Roker already assured his place in the weatherman hall of fame when he apparently stumbled across a reporter making a live broadcast in West Palm Beach, Florida, and decided to lend him a hand. The footage shows The Weather Channel’s Mike Siedel being held up by Mr Roker as the two lean into the 70mph wind - and get rather too close for comfort. Toppled: During Hurricane Ike in 2008, a Weather Channel anchor was swept by a gust of wind into bushes while he was delivering a report . 'Hurricane hug': NBC's Al Roker helped Weather Channel reporter Mike Seidel in need of assistance in 2004 in West Palm Beach, Florida . ‘You know I’m glad you showered this morning, Al’ said Mr Siedel. ‘You know, we ought to just lay down.' In another clip from 2008 a Weather Channel reporter was blown into a shrub mid-broadcast. The hilarious footage shows the the man tumble onto his side and land in a bush due to the force of Hurricane Ike. With admirable dedication to the cause he says into his microphone: ‘Hold on’ as he is upended and thrown onto a plant. Test run: ABC's Good Morning America decided to show viewers how 130mph winds really feel on a person, with an experiment at the University of Maryland . He then gets up and resumes his broadcast as if nothing had happened, saying: ‘Alright, sorry about that, that was a heck of a gust’. Veteran weatherman Jeff Morrow also fell victim to Hurricane Wilma in 2005 which left him barely able to move. ‘Woah! Very hard to stand,’ he says in the footage, which has been posted on YouTube. He adds: ‘Just the power of the hurricane’ as he is forced to bend at a 45 degree angle to stand up. ‘Wow, that’s some of the strongest wind I’ve ever had to stand in’. See videos here .

"It's been a whirlwind few days for Pippa Middleton, who was pictured leaving Wyoming after reportedly being hired by NBC's Today show. The Duchess of Cambridge's  younger sister was spotted at Jackson Hole airport in Wyoming after apparently inking a deal to be a correspondent for the popular NBC show. Pippa had been shopping for gifts and a teddy bear, possibly for her nephew Prince George, was peeking out of her bag. And she's off! Pippa Middleton leaves Wyoming after reportedly being hired by NBC's Today show and squeezing in a hoedown dance with locals surrounded by cameras on Wednesday evening. It is believed that she was filming a test piece for the Today show . The socialite and author looked comfortable and chic in jeans, a cosy cardigan and black boots. She accessorised with a chunky gold necklace and subtle rings. Pippa Middleton was spotted dashing in and out of the Big Apple this week for talks with Today show execs over a new correspondent's job for a reported $500,000 pay packet. Christmas gift? Pippa had been shopping for gifts and a teddy bear, possibly for her nephew Prince George, was peeking out of her bag . Still stylish: Despite the long flight ahead, the author looked comfortable and chic in jeans, a cosy cardigan and black boots . The Duchess of Cambridge's 31-year-old sister was seen wheeling her case to a waiting SUV at JFK around 5pm on Monday, dressed in a pristine Mackintosh with coordinating Loewe 'Amazona' purse which costs around $2,400. Less than 12 hours later, jet-setting Pippa was back at Kennedy to catch an outbound flight, dressed comfortably in a padded jacket, glasses and ankle boots. Pippa flew to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where she was spotted at a hoedown dance with locals surrounded by cameras. It is believed that she was filming a test piece for the Today show. It's a real royal hoedown! Pippa Middleton was spotted in Jackson Hole, Wyoming this week taking part in swing dancing while she was filmed by cameras in what appeared to be a test segment for NBC . Take your partners for a hoedown! Pippa tries her hand at  dancing with a local at a bar in Jackson Hole, Wyoming as a cameraman films her in what was believed to be a test segment for NBC's Today show . 'She was moving fast' one local said on social media after Pippa surprised everyone by popping up (with a camera crew) in Jackson Hole . According to the Daily News, the freelance columnist is hoping for a deal 'upward of $500,000' to report on lifestyle and health issues for NBC. Pippa has been in talks with the 'peacock network' for a new job after she was interview by Matt Lauer this summer, Page Six first reported, then confirmed to MailOnline by sources. NBC News previously denied that a deal was in the works but the network has reportedly been in serious talks with Pippa for months about becoming a lifestyle and health correspondent. Excited locals in Jackson Hole, posted pictures all over social media of Miss Middleton this week, dressed in boots, skinny jeans and wearing a checked shirt. Pippa performed a routine which involved some twirling and sashaying with an elderly gent in a cowboy hat before going on to have a drink at the bar. Emily hash-tagged one video clip with 'pippamiddleton' before saying that she had told the 31-year-old she was happy she visited, and received a gracious smile as a reply. Another person at the bar, Wyomingsith, remarked that she was 'moving quickly' and had only stayed for around ten minutes. Pippa got stuck in on the dancefloor in Jackson Hole at a local hoedown as she spun round with some locals . Pippa was on mark with the local fashion stakes fitting in with her flannel shirt, denim and boots as she enjoyed a spirited dance . Pippa first piqued NBC's interest in June when her interview, where she chatted over tea about her sister and Prince George, brought in high ratings for the network. It is expected that Ms Middleton, a former party planner and cookbook author who has been writing occasional columns about sports and lifestyle, will continue to focus on these subjects in her new role. NBC has declined to comment when approached by MailOnline. It is highly unlikely that Prince William's sister-in-law would report on the Royal Family as the subject is deemed off-limits. She is not the first with Royal connections to cash in as Charles Spencer, the brother of the late Princess Diana, also had a gig at NBC in the 1980s. The Queen's youngest son, Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, also dabbled in TV in the 1990s, forming the production company, Ardent, in 1993. The company made a number of documentaries and dramas but was voluntarily liquidated in June 2009, with total assets amounting to $65. Test run: Pippa Middleton's interview with Today's Matt Lauer in June brought in big ratings . In 2012, it was reported that NBC would offer Pippa $600,000 to be a royal correspondent but this was denied by the network. During her interview with Matt Lauer in June, which marked Pippa's first-ever TV appearance, the glamorous socialite shed light on her relationship with her sister, who is a member of the British Royal Family through her marriage to Prince William. Pippa seems set to join 'peacock' network NBC following months of secret talks over the deal . Asked about her relationship with Kate, Pippa said she and her sister are still very close and enjoy doing 'sisterly things'. Miss Middleton famously stole the spotlight during the Royal Wedding in 2011 when she donned a curve-hugging white bridesmaid’s gown for the ceremony. Pippa's media career has suffered a few minor setbacks this past year. Her party-planning book, Celebrate, suffered disappointing sales, and in May it was announced that Middleton had been dropped as a columnist for The Daily Telegraph after just six months. She still writes for Vanity Fair and is associated with the supermarket Waitrose. Pippa is currently dating stockbroker Nico Jackson, 36, who in July took a new job at a hedge fund in Switzerland. However according earlier reports, the couple's relationship has gone stale, Nico told friends. Pippa was recently spotted enjoying lunch with millionaire hotel tycoon Andre Balazs at his A-list haunt the Chiltern Firehouse in Central London. Balazs, who is now reportedly dating pop starlet Kylie Minogue, is known for his web of celebrity connections and owns several U.S. hotels including the Chateau Marmont in LA and New York's The Standard.

"Amanda Knox’s lawyers have threatened to sue the makers of a controversial new film about the murder of Meredith Kercher, which has won the approval of the dead British exchange student's family. The BBC movie, by British director Michael Winterbottom and starring Kate Beckinsale and Cara Delevingne, has won the apparent blessing of the Kercher family. The film is based on the book ‘Angel Face’, written by CNN journalist Barbie Latza Nadeau, who covered the brutal 2007 murder of Kercher, in the picturesque hilltop university town of Perugia. Scroll down for video . Miss Kercher (right), 21, was found half-naked with her throat slit in the cottage she shared with Amanda Knox . Miss Kercher, 21, was found half-naked with her throat slit in the cottage she shared with Amanda Knox. Knox and then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito served four years for the murder, before being released on appeal in 2011, but were sensationally re-convicted earlier this year. The American, nicknamed Foxy Knoxy, remains at large in the US while appealing to Italy’s Supreme Court. If she loses her final appeal she will become a fugitive, and the subject of a high profile extradition tussle. Knox’s lawyer Luciano Ghirga pointed out that Knox’s case was still ongoing, and said the American creative writing graduate would sue if the film ‘was damaging to her image.’ He said he hadn't seen it but 'supposed - knowing the author - that it implies that Amanda is guilty'. ‘There have already been at least two films and 12 books about the case. If the film is based even loosely on the murder in Perugia and if it is damaging to Amanda’s image, we will be asking for damages, as we have done in other cases.' But the writer insists the film does not 'place the knife in Knox's hand'. Knox, pictured in 2009 during her original trial, served four years in prison for Miss Kercher's murder . However, in 2011, she successfully appealed against the conviction and was released from jail . But the Kercher family, who were given a sneak preview of The Face of an Angel, have given their apparent blessing to the film, even allowing it to be dedicated to Meredith’s memory. Director Michael Winterbottom, who showed the film privately to Meredith’s brother Lyle, said it was important to him to keep the victim at the centre of the story, rather than Knox . Mr Winterbottom said: ‘The Kercher family had talked a lot about that, with a huge amount of dignity, the reasons they went for the trial was to make sure that amongst the chaos, it was remembered that someone had lost their life. That was one of the central things I thought about.’ He said he had dedicated the film to Meredith only with the Kerchers' permission, telling Screen International: ‘I didn’t want to do that unless someone from her family had seen it.' (From left to right) Actress Kate Beckinsale, director Michael Winterbottom, and actress Cara Delevingne celebrating at the premiere of The Face of an Angel, which is based on the court case . Knox herself is played by Cambridge graduate Genevieve Gaunt, 23, who appeared as Pansy Parkinson in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban in 2004 . Miss Nadeau, played by Beckinsale in the film, explained: 'There was a meeting in London with Michael and Lyle Kercher where he showed him the film. It was a very private thing. But if the Kerchers had objected to the film, the dedication to Meredith wouldn’t have been there.' She said: ‘I remember worrying that a movie about this murder would be ultimately sensational, bloody, and disrespectful to Meredith Kercher, who didn’t deserve to be a victim once more.’ She told the Mail: ‘Anything with Knox as the star would be disrespectful to Meredith. But the film is not really about the murder, it just uses it as a jumping off point.' The writer claimed she was not worried about being sued, as she said the film does not ‘place the knife in Knox’s hand’. Knox herself is played by Cambridge graduate Genevieve Gaunt, 23, who appeared as Pansy Parkinson, in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban in 2004. Formerly the love interest of Harry’s arch-nemesis Draco Malfoy, the actress has now blossomed into a striking brunette, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Knox.","Knox's layer Luciano Ghirga believes that film will 'imply Knox is guilty'

"Scientists have found a way to predict whether convicted criminals are likely to re-offend by looking at their brain . Neuroscientists claim to have found a way to predict whether convicted criminals are likely to re-offend by looking at their brain scans . According to American imaging experts, convicts showing low activity in an area of the brain associated with decision-making and action are more likely to be arrested again. A team led by Kent Kiehl, a neuroscientist at the Mind Research Network in Albuquerque, studied a group of 96 male prisoners shortly before they were due to be released. They scanned prisoners brains while they were carrying out computer tasks in which subjects had to make quick decisions and inhibit impulsive reactions. The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to focus on activity in a section of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) -  a small region in the front of the brain involved in motor control and executive functioning. They then followed the subjects for four years. Among the ex-criminals studied, those who had lower ACC activity during the quick-decision tasks were more likely to be arrested again after getting out of prison. This was even after the researchers accounted for other risk factors such as age, drug and alcohol abuse and psychopathic traits, Nature.com reports. According to American brain imaging experts, convicts showing low activity in an area of the brain associated with decision-making and action are more likely to be arrested again . Men who were in the lower half of the ACC activity ranking had a 2.6-fold higher rate of rearrest for all crimes and a 4.3-fold higher rate for nonviolent crimes. The results are published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences1. Kiehl admits that more work is needed to prove the technique and added  that low ACC activity could have a variety of causes — impulsivity, caffeine use, vascular health, low motivation or better neural efficiency — and not all of these are related to criminal behaviour.","Experts scanned anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in 96 prisoners .

"Nasa is preparing its fleet of martian scacecraft and rovers for a unique front row seat as a comet passes close by. Comet C/2013 A1, also known as comet Siding Spring, will pass within about 87,000 miles (139,500 kilometers) of the Red Planet on Sunday - less than half the distance between Earth and our moon, and less than one-tenth the distance of any known comet flyby of Earth. Researchers say it will provide an unprecedented opportunity to gather data on both the comet and its effect on the Martian atmosphere. Scroll down for video . An artist's concept of Comet Siding Spring (2013 A1) and Mars. Closest approach to Mars is on October 19, 2014. Spacecraft will collect in a 'duck and cover' move to avoid dust from the comet . Siding Spring's nucleus will come closest to Mars around 11:27 a.m. PDT (2:27 p.m. EDT), hurtling at about 126,000 mph (56 kilometers per second). This proximity will provide an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to gather data on both the comet and its effect on the Martian atmosphere. 'This is a cosmic science gift that could potentially keep on giving, and the agency's diverse science missions will be in full receive mode,' said John Grunsfeld, astronaut and associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. 'This particular comet has never before entered the inner solar system, so it will provide a fresh source of clues to our solar system's earliest days.' Nasa's Mars orbiters lining up behind Mars for their 'duck and cover' maneuver to shield them from comet dust that may result from the close flyby of Comet Siding Spring (C/2013 A1) on Oct. 19, 2014. Siding Spring came from the Oort Cloud, a spherical region of space surrounding our sun and occupying space at a distance between 5,000 and 100,000 astronomical units. It is a giant swarm of icy objects believed to be material left over from the formation of the solar system. Siding Spring will be the first comet from the Oort Cloud to be studied up close by spacecraft, giving scientists an invaluable opportunity to learn more about the materials, including water and carbon compounds, that existed during the formation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago. This graphic depicts the orbit of comet C/2013 A1 Siding Spring as it swings around the sun in 2014. Some of the best and most revealing images and science data will come from assets orbiting and roving the surface of Mars. In preparation for the comet flyby, NASA maneuvered its Mars Odyssey orbiter, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and the newest member of the Mars fleet, Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN), in order to reduce the risk of impact with high-velocity dust particles coming off the comet. The period of greatest risk to orbiting spacecraft will start about 90 minutes after the closest approach of the comet's nucleus and will last about 20 minutes, when Mars will come closest to the center of the widening trail of dust flying from the nucleus. Comet Siding Spring comes from the Oort Cloud, material left over from the formation of the solar system. 'This comet is coming into the solar system straight from the Oort Cloud. It's likely this is its first time this close to the sun,' said space scientist David Humm, of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland. Oort Cloud material, including comets, is scattered through a vast region that begins outside the orbits of Neptune and Pluto and extends a substantial fraction of the distance to Proxima Centauri, the closest neighboring star. Oort Cloud comets can tell scientists about the materials - including water and carbon compounds - that existed during the formation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago. The images above show -- before and after filtering -- comet C/2013 A1, also known as Siding Spring, as captured by Wide Field Camera 3 on NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. Studying this close encounter will be the largest fleet of orbiting scientific observatories ever flown to another world, orbiting around (and rolling on the ground of) Mars. These instruments will, for the first time ever, have the chance to make close-up observations of a comet new to the inner solar system. And though it will not be the easiest task, the teams operating these instruments and spacecraft have developed plans to take advantage of this rare opportunity. Siding Spring is small (the nucleus is less than a mile in diameter) and fast (it will pass Mars at about 34 miles per second). CRISM, HiRISE, and CTX were built to study a slowly-moving planet, so they will use MRO's ability to rotate in order to capture images as the comet speeds by Mars. The instruments will observe the comet repeatedly for two and a half days as it gets closer and closer to Mars before it makes its closest approach. The peak density of comet dust at Mars is expected 98 minutes after closest approach of the nucleus, and the MRO spacecraft will position itself behind the planet at that time. How graphic shows the science observations that may be captured by NASA Mars spacecraft during the close encounter with Comet Siding Spring (C/2013 A1). 'The hazard is not an impact of the comet nucleus itself, but the trail of debris coming from it. Using constraints provided by Earth-based observations, the modeling results indicate that the hazard is not as great as first anticipated. Mars will be right at the edge of the debris cloud, so it might encounter some of the particles -- or it might not,' said Rich Zurek, chief scientist for the Mars Exploration Program at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The atmosphere of Mars, though much thinner that Earth's, will shield NASA Mars rovers Opportunity and Curiosity from comet dust, if any reaches the planet. Both rovers are scheduled to make observations of the comet. NASA's Mars orbiters will gather information before, during and after the flyby about the size, rotation and activity of the comet's nucleus, the variability and gas composition of the coma around the nucleus, and the size and distribution of dust particles in the comet's tail. On Oct. 19, the comet will have a very close pass at Mars, just 82,000 miles (132,000 kilometers) from the planet. Observations of the Martian atmosphere are designed to check for possible meteor trails, changes in distribution of neutral and charged particles, and effects of the comet on air temperature and clouds. MAVEN will have a particularly good opportunity to study the comet, and how its tenuous atmosphere, or coma, interacts with Mars' upper atmosphere. Earth-based and space telescopes, including NASA's iconic Hubble Space Telescope, also will be in position to observe the unique celestial object. The agency's astrophysics space observatories -- Kepler, Swift, Spitzer, Chandra -- and the ground-based Infrared Telescope Facility on Mauna Kea, Hawaii -- also will be tracking the event.","Comet Siding Spring, will pass within about 87,000 miles (139,500 kilometers) of the red planet .

"St Louis schoolchildren chanted 'hands up, don't shoot!', pressing their faces to the glass and raising their arms out of open windows today, as their bus passed the convenience store where a man was shot dead by police on Tuesday. A 23-year-old, African-American man was killed by two cops after he allegedly lunged at the officers with a knife following a convenience store robbery in north St Louis. The children mimicked the show of solidarity being used by protesters in Ferguson after the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson. Children stuck their arms out of open windows on the school bus today and chanted 'hands up, don't shoot' as they passed the convenience store in north St Louis where a man was shot dead by police on Tuesday . St Louis schoolchildren mimicked the show of solidarity for Michael Brown being used by Ferguson protesters . The children who were on their way to school this morning were keenly aware of the convenience store parking lot as the scene of a shooting . Eye-witnesses to the Brown shooting said that the unarmed teen raised his arms in surrender before he was shot at least six times, including twice in the head on August 9. School has not been interrupted in St Louis unlike in the nearby Ferguson-Florissant District where classes were postponed last week. The district announced that no school will be held all week in the area following the unrest. The 'hands up' gesture has been adopted during the ten days of protests in Ferguson and across the country at demonstrations. Firefighters hose off the area where St Louis police say officers shot and killed a 23-year-old man who was wielding a knife and refused to drop it on Tuesday .

"A video clip claiming to show a naked man climbing down the facade of Buckingham Palace on a bed sheet has gone viral on the internet. The video show a couple of tourists standing on Constitution Hill, outside Green Park as the Changing of the Guard is taking place. As the video zooms towards Buckingham Palace, it appears as if a naked man has clambered out of a window onto a bed sheet and attempts to lower himself to the ground. These are the amazing scenes as a naked man apparently climbs from the window of Buckingham Palace . The daredevil is making his escape just as the Changing of the Guard is taking place . Two tourists seem almost oblivous to the ongoing drama as they wait for the soldiers to pass by . Despite a naked man just yards away the soldiers seem completely unaware of what is happening over their shoulder. The man is seen slowly lowering himself down the rope made from bed sheets over the course of several seconds.

"Online relations: 'Allie' Loftis was located by police Wednesday at the residence of a 45-year-old man she reportedly met online . Police arrested a 42-year-old man harboring a runaway 13-year-old Massachusetts girl at his New Jersey home Wednesday. Police say Alexandra ""Allie"" Loftis vanished from her Boston home for nearly two weeks after boarding a bus headed to New York City on November 4th, sending her parents on a relentless hunt to get their daughter back. Allie was located at Jorge Garzon's Jersey City residence and taken into police custody around 9 am Wednesday, after police say they received a tip off. Garzon, who also goes by the name George Gonzalez, was arrested just over an hour after her recovery at the Jersey address. Affirming Allie's father's fear, the two are believed to have met online, a sources close to the investigation told NJ.com. Allie's family had searched long and hard . for their daughter, never giving up hope, with their efforts rippling . throughout the New York area to local police stations, city streets and . across social media sites showing a number of various fliers. Believing . she had run away independently, her parents posted numerous messages to . her on Facebook, as well as pictures of them together, imploring her to . come home. Her father admitted that before her disappearance she seemed unhappy in school, but thought it was just a rough patch. Family pleas: Believing their daughter had chosen to run away, her parents posted numerous messages online, as well as pictures of them together, imploring her to come home . 'I live in semi-rural community where it's peaceful and quiet, and she wanted . big city, bright lights,' Mr Loftis said. 'She wanted to go to school in a . different area. As she said, where we live is boring.' Pleading, in hope that she may see their efforts and pain online, the family devoted a Facebook site to their missing daughter, posting a flood of photos of them together. 'One of many trips to get ice cream w dad,' her father, Tony Loftis, wrote above one picture of the two of them together. 'I luv u honey, pls let us know u r ok,' he wrote. Adventure: Allie, shown with her father and mother, had expressed frustration and boredom with their quieter Massachusetts community to her father, possibly building up to her New York City escape . Search: Allie's parents searched all the areas of the city they thought their daughter might go, focusing on Brooklyn where they knew she was more familiar . Following their daughter's trail the family traveled to New York City, chasing any and all leads of their daughter. Every location they thought she might go - from the Barnes and Noble in Park Slope Brooklyn to Prospect Park, both locations her father said he knew she loved - they handed out fliers and recruited volunteers. And with him having family in Brooklyn, the father hoped it's where she would be. Efforts: Family of Allie implored volunteers to take to street corners in matching T-shirts handing out fliers on their missing daughter, all around the city . 'Whenever I’m focused on trying to find . her, I’m okay. But, whenever that stops, and I’m home at night, and I wake up in . the morning, and I think, you know, I … I … I … it’s hard,' Mr Loftis told CBS Boston. 'You know this is . completely devas… you can’t … it’s my only daughter,' he said. Asking volunteers to take two Saturdays out of the next six to stand on street corners in matching T-shirts and fliers, the family's plan was to 'create a media event to help bring Allie home for the holidays,' her parents wrote in an email to volunteers, according to the Wayland Patch. 'We think . the only way to put pressure on the person holding her, and to keep the leads . coming, is to sustain media coverage,' they wrote. But after their daughter disappeared, Mr Loftis says she never turned on her cell phone or went on Facebook, despite him describing her as tech savvy. 'We have left voice mail messages on her cell phone until it got filled up. We’ve . tried every method we think possible but haven’t heard from her,' Mr Loftis told CBS after her disappearance. That made it even more concerning for him, with his fear that Allie could have been held against her will. Her father did confess his believe that she may have met someone online. Garzon, who Allie was found with, is currently being held in custody in the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office pending charges which have yet to be filed. The circumstances surrounding both her disappearance and the activities since she ran away are still under investigation, according to police. Growing attacks: Charges against the man Allie was found staying with have yet to be filed while the case remains an open investigation as police say cyber attacks on youth is a growing concern . Custody: Police say Allie took a bus from Boston Massachusetts to New York City, disappearing for nearly two weeks before she was found Wednesday in Jersey City .","Parents followed daughter's trail from Boston to New York City .

"A potentially dangerous wave of food fraud affecting everything from olive oil to tuna, spices and pomegranate juice has been exposed. Extra virgin olive oil is being diluted with cheaper vegetable oil, while tea bags might be bulked up with lawn grass or fern leaves, according to US researchers. Apparently healthy white tuna on a menu may actually be the less-expensive escolar, a fish that has been banned in many countries because of its links to food poisoning. Food fraud: Some manufacturers are selling cheap escolar - a fish that has been linked to a type of food poisoning - masquerading as tuna, a report warns . There is evidence from America that . manufacturers are secretly adding cheap pear and grape juice to . pomegranate, which is highly sought after as a health drink. While spices such as black pepper, . paprika and saffron may be bulked up with other plant material and . coloured with industrial, and potentially dangerous, dyes. The warnings come from the US . Pharmacopeial(correct) Convention, an independent scientific body which . sets quality standards for food and medicine. The organisation says many foods . contain ingredients which consumers would not expect to have bought - . akin to the recent scandal in Britain involving horse meat being found . in beef burgers. According to the report, called the Food Fraud Database, many of the added substances are less expensive and some are harmful. The situation mirrors warnings from . British trading standards chiefs who say the current economic climate . means manufacturers, retailers and restaurants may be more inclined to . cut corners. British experts have found that honey, . cheese, eggs, organic meat and produce, Basmati rice, even fish and . chips are not necessarily what they seem. Just before Christmas one British firm . was fined more than £20,000 for passing off a cheap pesto sauce as . something far more gourmet. Stark Naked Foods claimed its pesto . was made with extra virgin olive oil and Grana Padano cheese, when in . fact it was sunflower oil and a cheaper Latvian cheese. 'Fillers': Pomegranate juice, left, has been said to slow the spread of cancer, while olive oil, right, can help lower cholesterol - but both have appeared on a list of foods that often contain unexpected additives . At the same time, pubs and restaurants . are not immune to boasting of offering local quality food, when this . actually means the nearest supermarket or wholesaler. One estimate suggests British families . are wasting as much as £7billion a year paying over the odds for food . that has been faked in some way. There are cases of imported beef from . Zebu cattle, which have a distinctive hump on their neck, being imported . from south America and sold in pubs as ‘British’. Meat from cross-breed cattle . containing Zebu genes from Brazil is cheaper than British beef, however . critics point out that it can also be much tougher. Vast quantities of cheap honey is . being imported into Europe from China and used to bulk up other types in . a scam that has become known as ‘honey-laundering’. In some cases honey is not honey at all, but rather corn syrup or just sugar. Butcher shops and leading restaurants . have been found selling conventional meat and produce as organic, along . with a premium price. In the past, even Harrods has been found selling farmed salmon as wild. But the fakery does not stop at . salmon, for some fish and chip shops have been prosecuted for passing . off Shark Catfish, which is farmed in the rivers of Vietnam’s Mekong . delta, as battered cod. The fish sells for less than half the . price of real cod in wholesale markets, however chip shop customers are . being charged as if it is the real thing. Director of policy at the Trading . Standards Institute, Andy Foster, warned that a squeeze on spending . means his members find it increasingly difficult to stem the problem. Mr Foster said: ‘Wherever there is a few pounds to be made someone will try to exploit it. ‘In times of recession, when people . are looking for a bargain and going to different places, that is where . you start to find more fraud introduced to food.’","Healthy ingredients added to a list of foods regularly being bulked out with cheap - and sometimes harmful - substitutes by manufacturers .

"Tony Blair faced angry street protests in Thailand yesterday after jetting in to advise the country on peace and reconciliation. The former prime minister was heckled after local news reports claimed he was being paid more than £400,000 to speak at a one-day conference in Bangkok. Protesters carried banners saying ‘Blair ruined the UK, stay out of Thailand’, and ‘Blair speaks,  Thailand pays’. Protestors storm the streets of Bangkok after claims emerged last week Tony Blair was to be paid £400,000 to speak at the peace forum convened by the Thai government . Protesters in Bangkok fought against Blair's decision to take part in the forum held in the name of peace negotiation . The UK Foreign Office released a statement ahead of the planned protest on August 27 advising tourists to avoid the British Embassy in Bangkok . Protestors blast former prime minister Tony Blair who controversially went to war with Iraq in alliance with the United States in 2003 . Mr Blair, a Middle East peace envoy, denied receiving a fee for his appearance. So did the Thai government, who said taxpayers were covering only Mr Blair’s travel, accommodation and expenses. Mr Blair said: ‘Just for the record, I’m not being paid. I’m here because you invited me.’ He then cracked a joke about wearing a . blue-coloured tie to avoid association with either of  Thailand’s red . or yellow-wearing street protest groups. The event was organised in a . bid to draw a line under years of civil strife that followed a military . coup in 2006. But hopes of reconciliation between . Thailand’s feuding  factions were undermined after key opposition . figures boycotted  the conference. Tony Blair spoke at the forum held in Bangkok today which intends to bridge peace and reconciliation negotiations across Thailand . The former prime minister is one of the highest-paid public speakers in the world, once earning £364,000 for two 30 minute speeches in the Philippines . Within hours of Mr Blair’s lecture, Thai newspaper columnists were insisting nothing had been gained by the event. Mr Blair has faced a backlash in . Britain for writing a series of  hawkish newspaper articles calling for . Western intervention in Syria. The ex-premier, who was pictured last . week holidaying on the yachts of wealthy friends in the Mediterranean, . described the decision by the Commons to block military action as . ‘shocking’. Former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari appeared at the forum alongside Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and Middle East peace envoy, Tony Blair . Former Tory Cabinet minister David . Mellor called for a ‘period of silence’ from Mr Blair. Protesters in . Thailand also held a series of demonstrations against Mr Blair’s visit . outside the British embassy last week. They handed in a petition opposing his . participation in the conference, arranged under the title ‘Uniting for . the Future: Learning from Each Other’s Experience’. Mr Blair, who helped . to broker the peace process in Northern Ireland, told the conference . that the events of the past should be ‘honestly examined’ but never . judged. He urged the Thai government to engage opposition voices in the democratic process. A spokesman for Mr Blair said: 'Mr Blair was not paid for this event – he was there to talk, for free, about reconciliation. 'It was actually a very positive discussion. During his time there he also met with the leader of the opposition.'","Former prime minister gave speech at peace forum in Bangkok today .

"Compared to the regular gatherings of the Brownies and the bowls club at the village hall, the ‘relationship support meeting’ sounded a little unusual. Quite how unusual only became apparent after the first few meetings at Trumpington near Cambridge. The village hall had been used to hold a series of secret bondage classes. The workshops – complete with tea and biscuits – include ‘spanking’ and ‘flogging’, activities reputedly made popular by the success of the Fifty Shades Of Grey books. Unlikely venue: The bondage day will be hosted at Trumpington Village Hall, which was founded in 1908 and usually hosts groups such as the Brownies and WI . According to a day programme, which . has a £10 entrance fee, it will start with a guide to meet other . ‘kinksters’ and a class in caning. ‘Mr . Allen will show you how to truly get a bottom’s attention with canes,’ the guide boasts, while ideas are given on the instruments ‘suitable for . spanking both naughty and not-so-naughty bottoms’. Bestseller?: The event will teach aspects of BDSM, popularised in E L James's popular series of novels . The . programme ends with the note: ‘We’d very much appreciate it if you . could help us to pack up – stack chairs, collapse tables.’ But when it came to booking the hall, organisers Peer Rope Cambridge, a bondage group, appear to have been a little less frank. Hall . manager Barbara Fernandez, 51, said: ‘The woman who made the booking . said it was a “relationship support group meeting”. 'But it is not. It is . bondage. It did not say bondage on the booking form. Some of our little . old ladies who come to play bingo will be upset.’ Now all future classes have been cancelled. Hall trustee Philippa Slatter added: ‘We will be investigating.’ Peer Rope Cambridge has a policy of not commenting to the press. An expert from a London tannery would . have explained the intricacies of leather flogging devices, after which . a choice was available between learning about the erotic applications . of wax and a 30-minute class on nipples. More advanced sessions towards the . close of the event would have focused on electrified props including ‘violent . wand devices’, and later there was a financial session – ‘kink on a budget’ - exploring . ‘ways to indulge in BDSM without breaking the bank’. Attendees were warned on the group's website that they must stick to certain rules - including a 'no touching without asking' policy, and a 'no choking games' rule. Everyone must also always have access to 'a cutting tool' in case things go wrong. They were also told to stick to . 'vanilla [non-BDSM] dress and manners until you are well inside the . venue' so not to frighten the neighbours. However, after the hall's trustees were made aware of the true activities they immediately withdrew permission to use the venue.

"A senior Pentagon official ordered an emergency review of the military's use of an anti-malaria drug known to have severe psychiatric side effects - nine days after the Afghan massacre in which a U.S. solider allegedly shot dead 17 civilians including nine children, it has been alleged. The notorious drug Mefloquine, also known as Lariam, has been implicated in a number of suicides and homicides in the military spanning back more than ten years, with side effects including paranoia, hallucinations and psychotic behaviour. It is now being suggested that Staff Sgt Robert Bales, who is accused of the shooting, may have taken the drug before the March 11 massacre. Claim: It is now being suggested that Sgt Robert Bales was given the anti-malaria drug Mefloquin before the Afghan massacre which should not be administered to soldiers with prior brain injuries . Tragic loss: Anar Gul gestures to the body of her grandchild, who was allegedly killed by Robert Bales in Panjwai, Kandahar province south of Kabul, on March 11. The White House has since given $50,000 compensation for every victim . The military has used the drug for years despite its known side effects and in 2009, they almost banned it due to its dangers. But a subsequent order suggested its use should be restricted and not given to soldiers who have suffered a traumatic brain injury. Mefloquin is used to treat malaria and was developed by Army researchers towards the end of the Vietnam War. It gained support among the fighting forces because it works in areas where mosquitoes developed resistance to an earlier treatment, chloroquine, and requires just one tablet a week, not the daily dose needed with other medications. Side effects include seizures, depression, hallucinations, violent behaviour, feeling that others want to harm you, thoughts of hurting or killing yourself and many others. Almost four decades after inventing it, the U.S. Army pushed it to the back of its medicine cabinet. The about-face followed years of complaints and concerns that mefloquine caused psychiatric and physical side effects. Over the past four years, the Army . slashed by almost 75 per cent the amount of mefloquine it prescribes, even as it . sent thousands more soldiers to malaria-prone Afghanistan. Soldiers who had suffered from traumatic brain injuries were particularly advised against using it. 'Mefloquine is a zombie drug. It's dangerous, and it should have been killed off years ago,' said Dr. Remington Nevin, an epidemiologist and Army major who has published research that he said showed the drug can be potentially toxic to the brain. When Bales was in Iraq in 2010, he . sustained a massive brain injury. No one has been able to confirm . whether he had been given the drug or not, citing privacy rules. On March 11, it is alleged that the father-of-two sneaked out of his base before dawn and crept into houses in two nearby villages, opening fire on sleeping families within. Bales allegedly used his 9mm pistol and M-4 rifle, which was outfitted with a grenade launcher, to kill four men, four women, two boys and seven girls, then burning some of the bodies. The Huffington Post obtained a task order issued by Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs  Jonathan Woodson on March 20 which called for a review to ensure the drug was being administered appropriately. The website claims he called for an immediate 'review of Mefloquine prescribing practices' to be completed by the following . Monday, six days later. The order said: 'Some deployed service members may be . prescribed Mefloquine for malaria prophylaxis without appropriate . documentation in their medical records and without proper screening for . contraindications.' It also notes that this review must . include troops at 'deployed locations'. Spokeswoman for the Department of Defense Cynthia Smith issued a statement saying: 'The department wide review of Mefloquine prescription practices has no connection to the Staff Sgt Robert Bales investigation. 'Assistant Secretary of Health Affairs Jonathan Woodson requested this review in January to ensure each service conducts proper screening, patient education, and medical documentation.' In response to the Huffington Post's claims the email was sent on March 20, she said it was an army issue. Late last year, almost four decades after inventing a potent anti-malarial drug, the U.S. Army pushed it to the back of its medicine cabinet. The dramatic about-face followed years of complaints and concerns that mefloquine caused psychiatric and physical side effects even as it was used around the globe as a front-line defense against the mosquito-borne disease that kills about 800,000 people a year. 'Mefloquine is a zombie drug. It's dangerous, and it should have been killed off years ago,' said Dr Remington Nevin, an epidemiologist and Army major who has published research that he said showed the drug can be potentially toxic to the brain. He called it 'probably the worst-suited drug for the military' and noted that its side effects can closely mirror symptoms of stress disorders related to combat, making diagnosis of neurological problems difficult. Over the past three years, the Army slashed by almost 75 per cent the amount of mefloquine it prescribes, even as it sent thousands more soldiers to malaria-prone Afghanistan. Order: Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Jonathan Woodson allegedly ordered a review of the anti-malaria drug on March 20, though the DoD claim it was made in January . Accusations: Men stand next to blood stains and charred remains, left, inside a home where witnesses say Afghans were killed by Staff Sgt Robert Bales, right, who may have taken a dangerous anti malaria drug . The decrease in dose followed two . orders from military and Pentagon leaders in 2009. One, from the Army's . surgeon general, ordered the branch to limit its use to specific . circumstances. Other branches, however, continue to favor mefloquine. It gained support among the fighting . forces because it works in areas where mosquitoes developed resistance . to an earlier treatment, chloroquine, and requires just one tablet a . week, not the daily dose needed with other medications. In a case which has parallels with the massacre, in 2003 the army dropped the case against Staff Sgt Georg-Andreas Pogany, who also faced the death penalty, after he was charged with cowardly conduct as a result of fear. It came after he saw the shredded body of a gunned-down Iraqi and had what he thought was a panic attack - vomiting and hallucinations. A psychologist diagnosed a normal combat stress reaction and told him to rest and then return to duty. Defiant: The wife of Robert Bales defended her husband in an interview with Matt Lauer saying she finds the accusations against him unbelievable and claiming he would never do such a thing . Standing by her man: In the first interview since her husband was charged with the March 11 shootings, she revealed she has spoken to her husband twice and that he seemed confused . Instead, Pogany was shipped back to Fort Carson and charged with the crime, which is punishable by death under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The last such conviction in the Army occurred during the Vietnam War. The charges were dropped after doctors later determined that Pogany suffered from Lariam toxicity, which affected his behaviour when he was deployed in Iraq. Former Army Staff Sgt. Georg-Andreas Pogany had charges dropped against him due to the use of the drug and is now a post traumatic stress disorder advocate and spokesman . He is now a post traumatic stress disorder advocate and spokesman. Former army psychiatrist Elspeth Cameron Ritchie highlighted the continued use of the drug in the military and its connections with psychotic episodes. In her Time blog, she wrote: 'One obvious question to consider is whether he was on mefloquine, an anti-malarial medication. 'This medication has been increasingly associated with neuro-psychiatric side effects, including depression, psychosis, and suicidal ideation. 'The U.S. military has been avoiding the use of Mefloquine for some years. Yet it is still prescribed in some cases, since it is effective and needs only once a week dosing. It is still used in Afghanistan.' Bales' wife Karilyn spoke out for the first time about the accusations against her husband and said she found them 'unbelievable' and claimed they were not the actions of her husband. She also told NBC's Matt Lauer that Bales showed no signs of PTSD and wasn't having any difficulties sleeping. Questions to Bales' lawyer John Henry Browne were not immediately returned. But he has previously claimed his client has apparent mental health issues and is suffering with memory loss, among other things. Many family members of U.S. soldiers have blamed the drug on their loved ones' suicides. Retired Navy Capt Gary Foster said he cut his career short in part because of the effects of taking mefloquine in 2008 and 2009. 'I began to suffer short term memory loss, not able to recall what I had done earlier,' he said. 'I also had more bouts of anxiety, and I cannot for the life of me tell you why.' In February 2009, Army Surgeon General Eric Schoomaker sent a policy memo to doctors saying it should be used only if soldiers could not tolerate doxycycline, a general antibiotic effective at preventing malaria. In September 2009, Ellen P. Embrey, who at the time was deputy assistant secretary of defense overseeing health affairs, sent a letter similar to Schoomaker's. This time, it was directed across all military branches. A small but vocal group of anti-mefloquine campaigners seized on the memos as vindication. 'I was stunned,' said retired Navy commander Bill Manofsky, who said he sustained permanent damage to his sense of balance after taking Lariam in Kuwait in 2002 and has been a persistent critic of the drug. In 2008, the Army dispensed 8,574 courses of the drug. In 2010, it fell to 2,054. At the same time, the Army increased fivefold the number of doxycycline prescriptions — to more than 80,000 — reflecting the increasing number of soldiers deployed to Afghanistan. Spending followed a similar pattern, with the Pentagon buying almost $1.8 million of mefloquine in 2009, enough for about 10,000 yearlong courses. The amount dropped to $1.5 million last year. So far this year, the military has spent only about $50,000. It's not clear how many of the tablets have been dispensed. In August, Sen Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif, wrote to the secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs, urging them to strengthen safeguards for the use of the drug.","Order issued in 2009 saying soldiers who have suffered traumatic brain injuries - like Bales - should not be given the drug Mefloquine .

"Baby B out with his parents in Nottingham City Centre . It was the type of accident that could happen to any parent – in a split second, a young baby rolls off the bed and falls to the floor. For most, the outcome is a few tears and some cuddles, but for one couple it was the start of a terrifying ordeal. They were accused of child abuse and their little boy was taken away from them for almost a year. His parents were only allowed to see him for two hours, three times a week at a council contact centre. Last night the mother and father, finally reunited with their son, said they were treated like monsters by social workers and made to pay for previous failings in child protection. ‘In a flash we went from being proud first-time parents to being a part of this nightmare from which we could see no escape,’ said the child’s 30-year-old mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons. The accident happened in June last year as the baby’s father was preparing him for bed at 6.30pm. Having laid him on their double bed, he turned away momentarily when the nine-month-old went into a roll and fell on to the carpet. The boy’s reaction, however, was abnormal. His cries quickly turned into something more serious, and by the time his mother had run upstairs, his eyes were rolling back into his head and he appeared to be having a fit. An ambulance was called, but the paramedic became suspicious about the child’s injuries and by what he perceived as his mother’s lack of emotion. He made a safeguarding referral and the police were told. ‘At the hospital in Lincoln, we  were told social services would be informed but that hardly registered as we knew we’d done nothing wrong and were both frantic about our baby’s condition,’ said the mother. ‘It was only when, a couple of hours later, the doctors decided to transfer him to Nottingham for surgery and we popped home to get some belongings that the implications began to dawn on us. ‘There was a policeman on our doorstep telling us our home was a crime scene and we would not be allowed in until we had given a statement.’ By the next day their baby was in an induced coma in intensive care. Tests had revealed an earlier brain haemorrhage and multiple haemorrhages behind his eyes. The parents have now been cleared, but the judge took almost a year to make the decision, causing them to miss many big moments in their son's life, such as his first birthday . The implication was that he had suffered severe shaking on more than one occasion. ‘We didn’t know what to think,’ said the father. ‘We were struggling to take in the horror of it all when a social worker came into the room where we were both  in absolute pieces. ‘She looked us up and down like  we were child abusers and told us that we were no longer allowed access to our son without supervision. From that moment on, it was like he did not belong to us.’ The following day, they were asked to attend a police station where they were arrested on suspicion of causing GBH with intent, questioned separately and held for nine hours. ‘I was scared to death,’ said the father. ‘Neither of us has ever been  in trouble before. It was clear that they thought someone had shaken our baby on more than one occasion in the previous two weeks. The  only other person who had been with him was my widowed mother-in-law and a few days later she was also arrested. She will never get over the shock. Our whole world had fallen apart.’ After three weeks, the baby was well enough to leave hospital and Nottinghamshire County Council placed him with a foster family. ‘It was unbearable,’ said his mother. ‘One of the hardest times was his first birthday. We were given an extra hour and allowed to take him to a farm but a contact worker was with us at all times. In addition to the psychological torment, the parents were also faced with a significant monetary hit from legal fees . 'We were considered guilty and it just seemed inevitable that we would end up losing our treasured baby to adoption. ‘But knowing we were suspected of shaking him, I started researching it and found a lawyer, Rachel Carter, who writes a blog about  such cases.’ At a High Court hearing last month, the medical evidence against the couple collapsed as experts agreed that the baby’s earlier brain haemorrhage had been caused during his birth by emergency caesarean and that the fall had triggered a dramatic re-bleed. It also emerged that he had probably inherited his father’s condition, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome type 3, which makes sufferers prone to bleeding. With none of the other common signs of abuse such as bruises or neck injuries present, Judge Jeremy Lea ruled that the boy should return home. His mother added: ‘The council were convinced we had shaken him and they acted with a kind of hyper-vigilance. 'We were made to pay the price of all the previous failings in child care and it ended up costing the tax payer a fortune in legal aid.’ Steve Edwards, Nottinghamshire County Council’s director for children’s social care, said: ‘Our overriding obligation as an authority is to protect children from harm. ‘All the evidence in this case has now been fully tested by the court and we support the decision made by the judge.’","'Baby B' was taken away from his parents after an innocent fall .

"Traditional remedies for the condition have always been a rather hic and miss affair. But the days of attempting to drink water upside down, having someone inflict a shock on you, or holding your breath as long as  possible could be over. An inventor claims to have developed a device that stops the hiccups every time. Scroll down for video . The Hiccup Stick works by recreating the traditional cure of drinking water upside down, without the mess . It is little more than a plastic . stick with a hole in the middle. The user bites down on the stick and . drinks a glass of water through the hole. It appears the hiccups are stopped by . the combination of drinking the water and biting the stick, which makes . the throat muscles tense. The idea was developed after inventor . Chuck Ray had a bout of hiccups and decided to experiment by drinking a . glass of water with a pen in his mouth – and it eased his symptoms. He . said: ‘They didn’t stop immediately but it was enough to make me believe . I was on to something.’ Inventor Chuck Ray came up with the idea in frustration after suffering from bouts of hiccups throughout his life and trying to cure them by drinking water through a pen . He spent a month developing his idea . and getting it tested. Mr Ray added: ‘Soon I was getting calls back from . people who were amazed at the results. In every single case it worked . to stop hiccups, from kids as young as three to adults in their 80s. ‘It even worked with several people with more serious chronic hiccups.’ More than 10,000 Hiccup Sticks have now been sold at a cost of £13 for a pack of three online. Hiccups are a result of the layer of . muscle below the ribcage, known as the diaphragm, suddenly and . involuntarily contracting. Not all doctors are convinced by Californian . Mr Ray’s idea, pointing out that hiccups normally subside anyway. The Hiccup Stick may help those such . as Lisa Doherty, of Lincoln, who has been hiccuping every day for almost . five years since she was expecting her daughter Emily. Despite giving . birth in June 2008 and having a second daughter Sophie this year, her . hiccups have not stopped. She said: ‘It’s usually just one very loud one every hour.

"The BBC has spent more than £2million transporting staff and guests between London, Manchester and Salford in the past two years, it has been revealed. The broadcaster paid for at least 24,000 train journeys and more than 500 flights between the capital and its base in the North West. This is despite the corporation promising to employ more people who live near to its new MediaCity base in Salford. Expensive move: The broadcaster paid for more than 24,000 train journeys and more than 500 flights between the capital and its new MediaCity home in Salford . It spent more than £1.84m of taxpayers' money on trains and nearly £77,000 on flights. The corporation has shifted thousands . of staff to its northern headquarters since last May as part of its relocation to the North West, with many temporarily . working from two different sites. The bill for rail journeys increased by nearly 30 per cent between 2009-10 and 2010-11, according to figures released under Freedom of Information act and seen by the Daily Telegraph. And they would have been even higher if figures included journeys paid for by individual staff and claimed back through the BBC’s expenses system. In a separate FoI based on the period from May to December last year, spending averaged more than £100,000 a month. More than £640,000 was spent on rail journeys from London to Manchester, more than £45,000 on flights to Manchester and more than £160,000 on taxis. Trips included a £1,502 flight from Dubai and more than 50 three-figure taxi bills - including one for £653. Leaving London: The travel claims have come as the corporation has shifted thousands of staff from the capital to their northern headquarters since last May . Other journeys included £458.20 on air travel from Milan and a £712 flight to party hotspot Ibiza. The corporation now regularly publishes expenses claims by senior members of staff. Three years ago, it was slated over extravagant spending, including a £2,000 bill for director-general Mark Thompson to fly back early from a holiday in Italy. In January it emerged that BBC North director Peter Salmon had spent £1,115 on journeys between London and Manchester between April and June last year. A BBC spokesman said: 'We are a major broadcasting organisation with production bases across the UK and a news operation that covers a constantly changing global news agenda, so some element of travel is inevitable. 'However, we are mindful that we spend public money and we work hard to keep this expenditure to a minimum. Long commute: BBC Breakfast presenters Susanna Reid and Bill Turnbull . are now working from Salford and are entitled to a full relocation . package if they move . 'Some of these costs will be bookings for multiple passengers as the information provided from our booking system does not detail the number of tickets purchased on each booking.' BBC employees are required to take trains within mainline Britain unless there are time constraints or flights are significantly cheaper, according to its expenses policy. Staff can use shuttle buses to travel between BBC sites and late night and early morning journeys to work - between 10.45pm and 6.30am - will also be paid for by the BBC where staff are travelling from within a 40-mile radius. They will also meet excess costs of travel if workers are temporarily based somewhere other than their normal place of work - for example a London-based employee working from Salford. The National Audit Office will carry out a 'value for money' review of the move to Salford Quays later this year. Spending on travel from London to the North East . BBC Breakfast welcomed viewers to its new home in Salford today, with its usual presenters Bill Turnbull and Susanna Reid hosting the show from the northern city for the first time. Mr Turnbull previewed a news item on one in four people reportedly not knowing their neighbours by saying friends can now be made in other ways. Ms Reid continued: 'Talking of making new friends, we are very glad you have joined us for our first morning from our new studio in Salford.' Dr David Holmes, a psychologist at . Manchester Metropolitan University, talked about the survey, while . actress Connie Fisher - currently starring in the musical Wonderful Town . at the nearby Lowry Theatre - was also due on the show. Manchester-based human rights lawyer Pete Weatherby QC appeared to discuss the possible extradition of radical preacher Abu Hamza. The corporation's flagship morning programme will be fronted by Mr Ms Turnbull, Reid, Louise Minchin and Charlie Stayt, following the departures of presenter Sian Williams and sports presenter Chris Hollins. As permanent members of staff, Ms Reid and Mr Turnbull are entitled to a full relocation package should they choose to reside in Manchester, but Ms Minchin and Mr Stayt are freelance employees, so any move would be at their own expense. Forty-six percent of BBC Breakfast staff have relocated to Salford, but the BBC could neither confirm nor deny last night that Ms Reid would commute daily from London as has been reported. The team join around 2,200 BBC staff who have moved to Salford during the £1.5billion move, including employees from BBC Sport and BBC Children, Radio 6 Music, Radio 5 Live and North West Tonight.","Travel claims included £1.84m on trains and £77,000 on flights .

"It's well-known that marijuana will get you high, but a lesser known side-effect is that it can alter our response to negative emotions and images. A recent study has taken a look at the brain’s functioning in the presence of tetrahydrocannabinoid (THC) to understand how marijuana can affect the way we process emotions. THC is the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant. The research tested a group of men who were active users of marijuana. To qualify they had to have taken the drug four times or more in a year but not more than once a week . The European Neuropsychopharmacology journal has published a study that has confirmed the positive effect of THC to negative stimuli. The study, which was undertaken at the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands, claims that THC activates the endocannabinoid system naturally found in the brain to alter our response to negative images or emotions. With this discovery, the study argues that marijuana may now be touted as a cure to depression and other mental ilnesses. The research tested a group of men who were active users of marijuana. To qualify they had to have taken the drug four times or more in a year but not more than once a week. The study look at the functioning in the presence of tetrahydrocannabinoid (THC) to understand how smoking marijuana plants (pictured) can affect the way we process emotions . THC was administered to one group while another was given a placebo. The men were then asked to mimic images of facial expressions either 'happy' or 'fearful'. According to the study, people who had THC in their bloodstream were less accurate in matching the fearful facial expressions. However, they were able to perfectly copy those that looked happy. The results were confirmed by MRI scans of the men’s brains that revealed a beneficial effect of THC on emotion-processing cerebral regions. 'THC administration reduces the negative bias in emotional processing,' said the report. 'This adds human evidence to support the hypothesis that the endocannabinoid system is involved in modulation of emotional processing.' Scientists claim more studies  - such as those using scans (pictured) - are needed to understand the long-term impact of cannabis in adolescence . A study published last month . found that teenagers who regularly smoke cannabis suffer long lasting . brain damage and are in much greater danger of developing schizophrenia. American researchers . said the drug is particularly dangerous for a group of people who have a . genetic susceptibility to the mental health disorder - and it could be . the trigger.

"Houses in London's top 10 most expensive boroughs are worth as much as the entire property markets in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland combined, research has revealed. The total value of the UK's housing stock has risen slightly to £5trillion over the past year, but housing wealth is becoming increasingly concentrated in London and the South East, according to international real estate adviser Savills. In their annual Valuing Britain analysis, Savills found the capital's homes are now worth an aggregate £1.12trillion, accounting for 22.5 per cent of the UK's housing value. This graphic shows how house prices have fallen across the UK since 2007 except in London, where the total property stock has increased in value by 14.2 per cent. Scotland has seen a drop of 3.9 per cent, Wales 14 per cent and Northern Ireland 50.9 per cent - and the housing markets in all three countries are now worth the same as the capital alone . The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea is one of London's top 10 most expensive boroughs which the combined property wealth of is now more than the entire stock of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Pictured here is Cadogan Place . It shows how, while London's house prices have traditionally been higher, the financial crisis has triggered a polarisation of the market as property values fall in every other region of the UK. Ten years ago the UK's housing stock was worth just £2.9trillion, rising to £5.4trillion at the peak of the market in 2007. However, the UK total value remains -6.4 per cent below its peak while London's residential real estate has risen 14.2 per cent more than in 2007. The value gained - £140million - exceeds the total value of all homes across the whole of the North East of England where the total housing stock is worth just £128billion, researchers said. In the last year alone, it has risen by 6.8 per cent are now worth an aggregate £1.12trillion. At the other extreme, Northern Ireland's stock is worth £72billion, having fallen -10.2 per cent in the past year. Properties for sale in Glasgow which has a lower total value than the commuter hotspot of Elmbridge in Surrey, researchers found . Estate agent Savills says the capital accounts for some 37 per cent of the UK's total private rented stock value, putting it 36 per cent above the 2007 level . Savills say it reflects the fact that equity rich markets have outperformed the average and property wealth continues to be more and more polarised between North and South, and between different tenures. Northern ireland has been the worst affected part of the UK since the crisis with the value of stock falling 50 per cent to £72billion. The ten London boroughs highlighted in the report are Westminster, Kensington & Chelsea, Wandsworth, Barnet, Camden, Richmond, Ealing, Bromley, Hammersmith & Fulham and Lambeth. Together, they have an aggregate value equivalent to the total value of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland combined at just over £550billion. Even within London, wealth is increasingly focused in core central and high value boroughs. Northern ireland has been the worst affected part of the UK since the crisis with the value of stock falling 50 per cent. Pictured here is terraced house in Bushmills, County Antrim . The richest borough – the City of Westminster – has just 121,600 units, with a total value of £95billion, more than twice the value of Edinburgh and almost three times that of Bristol. And beyond the capital the analysis highlights some pockets of very concentrated housing wealth. For example, the high value commuter hotspot of Elmbridge in Surrey, which includes Cobham, Esher and Weybridge, has a housing stock value of £31billion, more than that of Glasgow (£29billion), while that of Windsor and Maidenhead (£23billion) is slightly more than that of Cardiff. London's dominance is even more pronounced in the private rented sector than in the owner occupied sector. The capital accounts for some 37 per cent of the UK's total private rented stock value, putting it 36 per cent above the 2007 level. At the owner occupier level, some £1.7trillion of housing is now in the hands of owners with no mortgage debt. This is an increase of 76 per cent in the past 10 years, and 1.4 per cent in 2012. By contrast, mortgaged properties have a total value of £1.8trillion, just 42 per cent higher than in 2002 and down -0.6 per cent on last year. This means that mortgaged owner occupied stock accounts for 37 per cent of the total value of UK housing compared to 44 per cent 10 years ago. Lucian Cook, director of Savills residential research, said: 'These distinctions between North and South, and in particular between London and the South East and the rest, and the concentration of housing wealth in ever fewer hands, will have long term implications. 'It will affect people's ability to get on the housing ladder, trade up or relocate. In turn, it has implications for social and labour mobility and, ultimately, the economy. 'Our analysis also highlights growing value in the private rented sector, not least because demand continues to outpace supply. 'This will create investment opportunities for those with equity, and opportunities for institutional investors to meet the needs of those excluded from home ownership.'","Study shows housing wealth is increasingly concentrated in South East .

"Ferguson's mayor insisted there is no racial divide in his city hours before the streets once again were rocked by violent clashes between a largely African-American community and white police force. Mayor James Knowles said on Tuesday that Ferguson has been 'a model for the region' - and that 95 per cent of people who live the town would agree with him. The streets of Ferguson were filled with protesters for the tenth night running on Tuesday, angered at the cop shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown on August 9. The peaceful demonstrations disintegrated into a series of clashes that led to 47 arrests, with police claiming they were pelted with bottles of urine. Scroll down for video . Delusional? Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said in an interview on Tuesday that there was 'no racial divide' in Ferguson before the city descended into another night of violent protests . Police arrest a man as they disperse a protest in Ferguson in the early hours of Wednesday. A few hours earlier the city's mayor said there was 'no racial divide' in the community . In an interview on MSNBC's NewsNation, Mayor Knowles said: 'There's not a racial divide in the city of Ferguson. That is the perspective of all residents in our city. Absolutely.' Mayor Knowles said he believed 'the 95 percentile' of Ferguson residents had faith in the community leaders and that violence on the streets was 'being caused by a very small number of protesters coming from outside of our community'. He conceded that the lack of diversity in the Ferguson police force had to be addressed. Only three of the 53 officers are African-American. The mayor said the protests were not representative of Ferguson's community of 2,200 residents, where 67 per cent of residents are black. 'Ferguson as we've become more African-American, we've focused on things that unite us and not divide us, ' Knowles said. City leaders had urged people to stay home after dark on Tuesday to 'allow peace to settle in' and pledged to try to improve the police force in the St. Louis suburb. In a public statement, the city said the mayor, the City Council and employees have been exploring ways to increase the number of African-American applicants to the law enforcement academy, develop incentive programs to encourage city residency for police officers and raise money for cameras that would be attached to patrol car dashboards and officers' vests. Police arrested dozens of protesters on West Florissant Avenue after they refused to leave the area and some began throwing objects at officers early on Wednesday . The statement said: 'We plan to learn from this tragedy, as we further provide for the safety of our residents and businesses and progress our community through reconciliation and healing.' The St Louis suburb still had plenty of lively protests on Tuesday but the overall scene was more subdued than the past five nights, with smaller crowds, fewer confrontations and no tear gas. Police said they still made 47 arrests, mainly of people who defied orders to disperse. The slight easing of tensions came as Attorney General Eric Holder is set to arrive in Ferguson to meet with FBI and other officials carrying out an independent federal investigation into Brown's death. In a letter published late on Tuesday on the St. Louis Post-Dispatch website, Holder promised a thorough investigation while calling for an end to the violence in Ferguson. He said the bond of trust between law enforcement and the public is 'all-important' but also 'fragile.' Arrest patterns 'must not lead to disparate treatment under the law, even if such treatment is unintended. And police forces should reflect the diversity of the communities they serve,' Holder wrote. Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson (left) shot dead unarmed teenager Michael Brown (right) on August 9 sparking ten days of violent protests in the streets of the city . He said the Justice Department would 'defend the right of protesters to peacefully demonstrate and for the media to cover a story that must be told'. The department has mounted an unusually swift and aggressive response to Brown's death, from conducting an independent autopsy to sending dozens of FBI agents to Ferguson in search of witnesses to the shooting. A grand jury also could begin hearing evidence on Wednesday to determine whether the officer, Darren Wilson, should be charged in Brown's death, said Ed Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County's prosecuting attorney. Wilson was recognized during a Ferguson City Council meeting in February, getting special recognition for what Police Chief Thomas Jackson said then was his role in responding to a report of a suspicious vehicle, then struggling with the driver and detaining him until help arrived. Jackson said the suspect was preparing a large quantity of marijuana for sale. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon said Tuesday that he would not seek the removal of the prosecutor overseeing the investigation into Brown's death. St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch's deep family connections to police have been cited by some black leaders who question his ability to be impartial. McCulloch's father, mother, brother, uncle and cousin all worked for the St. Louis Police Department, and his father was killed while responding to a call involving a black suspect. Nixon said he would not ask McCulloch to leave the case, citing the 'well-established process' by which prosecutors can recuse themselves from pending investigations to make way for a special prosecutor. Departing from that process, Nixon said in a statement, 'could unnecessarily inject legal uncertainty into this matter and potentially jeopardize the prosecution.' McCulloch, a Democrat, was elected in 1991 and has earned a reputation for being tough on crime. Ferguson city leaders said the mayor, the City Council and municipal employees have been exploring ways to increase the number of African-American applicants to the law enforcement academy, develop incentive programs to encourage city residency for police officers and raise money for cameras that would be attached to patrol car dashboards and officers' vests. 'We plan to learn from this tragedy, as we further provide for the safety of our residents and businesses and progress our community through reconciliation and healing,' officials said in a public statement.

"A teenager who drunkenly posted a picture of himself burning a poppy on Facebook was in police custody last night. Officers arrested Linford House after they received a complaint about the image that was published in the early hours of Remembrance Sunday. When police called at his parents’ home that evening, the 19-year-old had already taken down the image on a friend’s advice.. A man, named locally as Linford House (pictured right), 19, was arrested yesterday after the image (left) appeared online. The words on the right image have been written on by a third party, who posted it online . It showed a cigarette lighter with a . flame catching light to the bottom of a poppy, allegedly with the words: . ‘How about that you squadey [sic] ****s’. The student was questioned by . detectives for several hours yesterday afternoon and last night he was . still in custody facing a second night behind bars. His father Keith, 50, branded him ‘idiotic’ and said the whole family had been disappointed by his behaviour. But he questioned whether it was right to hold the teenager. Sportsman: House is said to be a member of the Snowdown Colliery Rugby Football Club, where his father Keith is club captain . ‘He has been stupid but it’s totally . out of order to arrest him over one complaint,’ he said. ‘I would have . preferred if they had come, taken him to the police station and told him . off. ‘We’ve been told he cannot stay at . ours and should go to relatives or friends in case people are out there . wanting to carry out reprisal attacks. That’s the advice of the police. We’ve had loads of phone calls from people who are angry and outraged.’ He said his son had got very drunk at a . party before he posted the picture: ‘He was woken up by a phone call . from one of my mates telling him to remove it. He couldn’t remember . putting it up. ‘He deleted it as soon as he realised. The next thing we know is that he has been arrested.’ House was arrested under the Malicious . Communications Act, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in . jail and/or a £5,000 fine. His grandmother Valerie said: ‘He’s been an . idiot while drunk but the police have gone over the top on this one.’ The family from Aylesham near . Canterbury has the support of civil liberties groups, which claim the . arrest is an infringement of free speech. Nick Pickles, from pressure group Big . Brother Watch, said: ‘It is not illegal to offend people and, however . idiotic or insensitive the picture may have been, it is certainly not . worthy of arrest. ‘The case highlights the urgent need . to reform a law that poses a serious risk to freedom of speech.’ Agnes . Callamard, of the Article 19 campaign group, said: ‘Causing offence, . showing poor judgment or expressing views which people find to be in bad . taste should not amount to criminal prosecution.’ Emdadur .

Does the arrest of a man for posting a picture of a burning poppy threaten free speech? Does the arrest of a man for posting a picture of a burning poppy threaten free speech? Now share your opinion . But war veterans and community leaders reacted with disgust at the poppy-burning stunt. ‘It’s absolutely disgusting and . disgraceful what this lad allegedly did,’ said Granville Cosier, a local . councillor and ex-serviceman. ‘I’m sure any right-minded person would . agree with me that whoever did it should be dealt with and severely . punished. ‘Even if he says he was drunk or under the influence of drugs, it doesn’t excuse what was done.’ Bob Thompson, another local councillor, said: ‘The image on the internet has cast a dark shadow over Remembrance Day.’ House is on a practical environmental . studies building course and is a member of the Snowdown Colliery Rugby . Football Club where his father is club captain. Kent Police said yesterday: ‘Following . an investigation, a 19-year-old Canterbury man was arrested on . suspicion of an offence under the Malicious Communications Act.’ In March last year, Emdadur Choudhury, . of Muslims Against Crusades, was fined £50 for burning replica poppies . on Armistice Day.

'We're now five days away from a very dangerous moment. I urge US policymakers to quickly come to a resolution before they reach the debt ceiling deadline... Inaction could result in interest rates rising, confidence falling and growth slowing,' World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said in a briefing following a meeting of the bank's Development Committee. 'If this comes to pass, it could be a disastrous event for the developing world, and that will in turn greatly hurt developed economies as well,' he said. Scroll down for video . Disastrous: World Bank chief Jim Yong Kim warned Saturday that the United States was headed toward peril as politicians failed again to resolve a standoff over the budget . The alarming remarks from the Korean-American came after three days of talks revolving around meetings of the 188-nation International Monetary Fund and its sister lending agency, the World Bank, where top officials pressed the US to resolve the political impasse over the debt ceiling. The standoff has blocked approval of legislation to increase the government's borrowing limit before a fast-approaching Thursday deadline. US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has warned that he will exhaust his borrowing authority on Thursday and the government will face the prospect of defaulting on its debt unless Congress raises the $16.7 trillion borrowing limit. 'We know there are problems,' Tharman Shanmugaratnam, the head of the IMF's policy-steering committee and Singapore's finance minister, told a news conference at the end of the IMF meeting. 'We know there are near-term risks, the most obvious one being what's going on in the US with regard to the fiscal deficit.' But one of the big near-term concerns, the expectation that the US Federal Reserve will start scaling back its massive stimulus program for the economy, is actually pointing to a positive development, Tharman said. Talks: Jim Yong Kim, (left), president, World Bank Group, and Christine Lagarde, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director, talk before a meeting of the Development Committee during the World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings in Washington . It means that the U.S. economy is strong enough to withstand a reduction of the stimulus. IMF officials have been forecasting that the strengthening U.S. economy will be a main driver of the global economy in the coming year. At the same time, developing country economies are slowing and their markets have been unsettled since May by anticipation that the Fed will soon begin tapering its $85-billion-a-month bond purchases, which poured cash into the economy to stimulate growth. 'The eventual normalisation of monetary policy as economies recover in the West will be a net positive for the emerging economies,' Tharman said, meaning that the strength of the major economies would help carry the global economy forward. Lew told finance ministers that the US understood the role it played as 'the anchor of the international financial system', and assured them the administration was doing all it could to reach a resolution on the debt. Stalemate: Speaker of the House John Boehner walks to his office after a meeting with fellow Republicans at the Capitol in Washington on Saturday . An effort Saturday to pass a one-year extension of the borrowing limit failed to get sufficient votes. But in a more hopeful sign, negotiations began between Democratic and Republican Senate leaders to end the impasse. Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, was one of a number of officials who were guardedly confident that an eleventh-hour deal would be reached, as it has in similar standoffs in the past. 'I still think it is unthinkable that an agreement won't be found,' Draghi told reporters on Saturday. 'If this situation were to last a long time, it would be very negative for the U.S. economy and the world economy and could certainly harm the recovery.' But once Draghi moved beyond the US impasse, he sounded upbeat about the prospects for a European recovery. That in itself is a dramatic turn from the past three years, when global financial leaders were taken up with waves of crisis sweeping across the region and necessitating a series of international rescue loans. Business not as usual: President Barack Obama yesterday discussed challenges from the partial government shutdown small business owners . The IMF called on emerging economies, which have been the drivers of the global economy in recent years, to undertake reforms that will help their economies better withstand the scaling back of monetary stimulus in the U.S. and other major economies. When the stimulus money was flowing, emerging economies benefited from investments as investors were attracted by their relatively higher rates of interest vis-a-vis the United States and other major economies. But many of those same countries that benefited from capital flows have been rocked since May, as the investment flows reversed and flowed back toward the US as rates here began to rise. Alexandre Tombini, the head Brazil's central bank, told the IMF steering committee that the worries about the US and global economies might be overblown. 'A while ago there was an excess of exuberance and now perhaps an excess of pessimism,' he said. Negotiating: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada is surrounded by reporters as he leaves the Senate floor to meet with Senate Democrats regarding the government shutdown and debt ceiling . Time is ticking: Republican Senator from Kentucky Mitch McConnell walks off the Senate floor after a vote on the motion to proceed on the Debt Limit Bill . The stark warnings from the World Bank came the same day that House Speaker John Boehner today told fellow Republicans that his talks with President Barack Obama have stalled. 'The Senate needs to hold tough,' Representative Greg Walden said Boehner told House GOP lawmakers. 'The president now isn't negotiating with us.' Obama rejected the speaker’s effort to lift the debt ceiling for six weeks and reopen government in exchange for a budget negotiating process. Attention now turns to the Senate, where a bipartisan group of Senators are working on a separate plan to reopen the government. New plan: Republican Senator from Maine Susan Collins leaves a Republican meeting and heads to the Senate floor to vote on the motion to proceed on the Debt Limit Bill . Word of the negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and the top Republican, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, emerged as the Senate, as expected, rejected a Democratic effort to raise the government's borrowing limit through next year. Republicans objected because they want the extension to be accompanied by spending cuts. The calendar is edging closer to the October 17 deadline to raise the federal debt ceiling. After that, administration officials have said the government will deplete its ability to borrow money, risking a first-time federal default that could jolt the world economy.","American government still in shutdown mode as politicians fail again to resolve standoff .

This morning Evans’s constituency association chairman backed him over his sex assault allegations and said local Tories would continue to support him. Michael Ranson said: ‘Ribble Valley Conservative Association is disappointed that the CPS have indicated that they have charged our MP Nigel Evans with rape and other sexual offences. ‘Nigel has strongly denied all the offences and has said that he will vigorously defend them - in the United Kingdom a person is presumed innocent until he is found guilty in a court of law and we will continue to support Nigel at this very difficult time. ‘We understand that Nigel has resigned as deputy speaker and will return to the backbenches where he will continue to represent the people of the Ribble Valley as he has done for the last 20 years. ‘He will hold regular surgeries and deal with the usual heavy caseload of constituents’ problems. ‘We hope that the case will come to court as soon as possible so that the uncertainty hanging over Nigel and the constituency can be quickly resolved.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Nigel Evans was arrested in May on five counts of rape and sexual assault .

"A couple have found a metre-wide safe they believe is more than a century old in their back garden, but there's just one problem. They've no idea how to get into it. David and Nikki Maguire found the heavy, rusting box - made by the same firm which supplied the Titanic - sticking out of the earth after they drained their . garden pond in Gateshead. Mr Maguire, 34, spent an afternoon tirelessly shifting heaps of soil and was astounded to find the safe completely intact. Under lock and key: David and Nikki Maguire - and their three-year-old daughter Alice - found this rusting fire-proof safe at the bottom of their garden in Gateshead, but without a key its contents are a mystery . Mystery: The safe bears the logo of Milners, a firm whose founder used bonfires to show his safes' strength . A locksmith is now due to visit the couple tomorrow morning - but for the moment, they are enjoying the mystery. 'We’ve got a little girl Alice, who is three, so we . drained the pond,' said Mrs Maguire, 32, who works for St Oswald's Hospice in Newcastle. Plaything: Alice, three, with her new garden toy . 'We’d seen this bit of bronze metal . poking out from where the old pond used to be for a while but just . thought it was part of an old pump. 'We were completely amazed when it . turned out to be the top of a safe. My house was built in the 1920s, but . this looks a lot older than that.' She added: 'It’s . so heavy to lift, we can barely do it between us, so we’ve had to roll . it across the garden and we can hear there’s something inside.. It could . just be soil after all these years, but it might be something . interesting, you never know!' 'Before my house was built, there were . flats here. I don’t know if it’s been brought up here to be buried . especially when they were building the houses. We’ve just got no idea.' The . safe was made by Milners, which began working in 1814 under Thomas . Milner and became famous for developing the world’s first fire-proof . safes. The businessman used . to wow crowds with stunts involving elaborate street bonfires to . demonstrate that his safes could protect anything that was inside, and . five of them were used on the Titanic. On . the front of the safe found in the Maguires’ garden is a plaque which . reads ‘Milners of London, Manchester and Liverpool’ and ‘Patent fire . resisting special safe’. It is likely to date from between the mid-19th Century and 1955, when the Milner company merged with the firm Chatwood. A locksmith will be coming to the couple's home tomorrow morning to prise open the safe, and it could be a difficult job. Mystery solved: The couple are due to be visited by a locksmith tomorrow who will try and prise the box open . Grand: The firm supplied five of the high-security safes that were used on the doomed liner Titanic in 1912 . 'It's not in the best condition,' said Mrs Maguire. 'I don't know how they're going to get into it. It could take a long time.' Other safes in a good condition sell for hundreds of pounds on eBay. But Mrs Maguire and her husband, a manager at the Baltic modern art gallery in Gateshead, said they would be happy to give it to a local museum for free. 'I've no desire to keep it,' she said.

"For many, Thanksgiving means relaxing and spending time with loved ones. Employees at megaretailer Macy's, however, may find themselves working Thanksgiving night. The move would end the department store chain's 155-year tradition of staying closed on Thanksgiving Day. Macy's stores in several major cities are expected to be affected. The Chicago Sun-Times reports five employees at the Chicago store said their bosses told them to expect to work Thanksgiving night. Macy's holiday shoppers, like the ones seen in this file photo, may be able to shop as early as 8pm Thanksgiving night . One employee, the paper adds, said she also received a memo stating the store would open on 8pm that night. The New York store at Herald Square, famed for its role in Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade, will also open, according to Women's Wear Daily. In preparation for the opening, Macy's allegedly sent out a . survey to its employees at an unidentified store, asking about shift availability. An anonymous source passed the information on to Consumerist. 'The . Thanksgiving Holiday is also a critical time and we are counting on you . to help make it successful. Your store will open at 8pm on Thursday, . November 28th. We would like to know if you are able to work an opening . shift beginning at 7.30pm on Thursday, November 28th,' the survey reads. The Chicago Macy's, seen here in this file photo, is expected to have an early opening, according to employees. One said she received a memo warning of an 8m opening on Thanksgiving night . After . employees stated their availability, they were allegedly taken to . another page that said they may not have a say in the matter. 'We . will do our best to honor your preferences,' it reads. 'Based on the . needs of the business we may still need you to work an opening shift. Please be sure to review your schedule for any assigned shifts.' Chicago employee Sharay Johnson told the Sun-Times she . expected to work from 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving night to 5 a.m. Friday and . then again from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Friday -- but was excited to work . those hours. 'I love it,' she said. 'It will give me an extra 20 hours of work.' For the last two years, Macy's opened its 800 nationwide stores at midnight for 'Black Friday,' in efforts to get holiday shoppers looking for early-bird bargains. Macy's CEO Ted Lundgren told reporters on October 4 that  he ' will never say ""never""' in regards to an early opening, Newsday reports. 'I want to do whatever customers and associates want,' Lundgren said. Newsday reports that Lundgren described the enthusiasm of employees to work at midnight on Thanksgiving Day.

"A Texas middle-school football player has died after suffering a severe allergic reaction to fire ant bites during a game last week. Cameron Espinoza was pronounced dead Monday morning after spending five days in intensive care at Driscoll Children’s Hospital, where he was put in a medically induced coma to reduce the swelling in his brain. The boy lost consciousness last Wednesday after being attacked by ants during a halftime at Haas Middle School in Corpus Christi. Rest in peace: Cameron Espinosa, 13, (left) passed away five days after he was bitten by ants last Wednesday . Football player: The young teenager was attacked by insect during halftime and lost consciousness . 'CCISD is deeply saddened by the . tragic loss of one of our very own Haas Middle School students,’ a . statement posted Monday on Corpus Christi Independent School District's . Facebook page read. 'We . would like to extend our thoughts and prayers to the family and friends . of this student. The District will do all we can in support of the . student’s family and the entire Haas school community during this sad . time.' Haas Middle School . had a moment of silence in honor of the 13-year-iold, and grief councilors have been made available to students and staff. All athletic and extracurricular activities at the school have been cancelled for the rest of the week, according to the station KHOU11. Cameron's . mother, Josephine Limon, has retained an attorney to represent her . family. Speaking to the station KRIS-TV, the grieving parent pointed a . finger of blame for her son’s death at school staffers. ‘My . baby could be here if there were more trained personnel on the field, . she said. ‘An epipen or something could have saved him at least.’ Miss . Limon said the 13-year-old, whom she described as an ‘amazing boy,’ aspired to study medicine and play football in college. CCISD . school board member Hector Salinas spoke out in the wake of the . tragedy, telling KRIS-TV the coaches should have done more to ensure the . football field was safe after first learning of an ant infestation. Espinosa, . an eighth grade student at Haas Middle School in Corpus Christi, was . huddled with fellow players during halftime of a game with nearby Hamlin . Middle School, when he began to scream, ‘Ants! Ants!’ 'Ants! Ants!': The high school student screamed when he was bitten by the ants . A coach ran over and attempted to squirt . the ants off Espinosa's legs using a water bottle shortly before he lost . consciousness and collapsed on the field, according to KZTV. The coach called 911 while an assistant coach ran to a nearby gym to find a defibrillator, which they used to restart the boy's heart. Paramedics arrived shortly afterwards and transported the boy to Bay Area Hospital in Corpus Christi. He was later transferred to Driscoll Children's Hospital, also in Corpus Christi, where he passed away overnight Sunday. Funeral services for Cameron will be held Wednesday, followed by a Mass and burial Thursday. The school will retire his Jersey No. 66. The principal told KZTV that the football field would not be used until it had been treated for ants. It is likely that the ants were fire ants, given the boy’s reaction, said Dr Stanley Fineman, an allergist with the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Clinic and immediate past president of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Student: Espinosa, 13, studies at Haas Middle School (pictured) in Corpus Christi, Texas . Hospitalised: He is still in critical condition at the hospital . Deadly insects: Around 40 people die every year in the country from allergic reactions to insect bites and stings such as from wasps . Fire ants can be red or black. They're the only ants that inject venom, which is what prompts an allergic reaction that can vary from a single itchy, red bump to hives or anaphylactic shock, he said. ‘In some patients only one sting could trigger a life-threatening reaction,’ Fineman said. Insect stings send more than 500,000 Americans to emergency rooms every year, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, and more than 40 people die annually from insect sting anaphylaxis. Typically, insects which generate allergic responses are either stinging insects like wasps, bees, hornets and ants, or biting insects such as mosquitoes and ticks.","Cameron Espinosa from Corpus Christi was playing a football game when he was bitten .

"Historic: Mrs Justice Eleanor King has sanctioned the first sterilisation of a man in this country because it is 'in his best interests' A disabled man will have to be sterilised because it would damage his life to have any more children, a judge ruled yesterday. Mrs Justice Eleanor King said the man, who has a mental age of between six and nine years, was deeply distressed when his girlfriend became pregnant four years ago. The child is now being looked after by his grandmother. However the judge decided sterilisation ‘was in his best interests’ as he could not be relied on to use condoms or other birth control methods to prevent another pregnancy. The 36-year-old, who can only be referred to as DE, is in a long-term relationship with his girlfriend – who also has learning difficulties. While he is dependent on his parents, the court heard that he had got to the stage where he could catch a bus, go swimming, or go and buy a coffee by himself. The judge made it clear that DE’s relationship with his girlfriend, which was disrupted by her pregnancy, should be supported and the couple ‘should be permitted to resume their sexual relationship’. But she said that having another child would threaten his hard-earned independence. And she insisted that the vasectomy would let him have ‘as normal a life as possible as soon as possible’. ‘DE is unequivocal in expressing his wish not to have any more children,’ she said. The application to Mrs Justice Eleanor King, sitting in the Court of Protection, was made by DE's local NHS Trust with support from his parents, his GP and the local authority involved in his care . Claiming the ruling would be in his . best interests, she added: ‘DE’s hard-earned achievements, whether they . are learning to swim by imitation as he can’t process spoken . instruction, or getting a bus on his own, must be treasured.’ The . application to sanction a vasectomy had been made by the man’s NHS . trust, supported by his parents, GP and the local authority that . organised his care. The ruling in the Court of Protection is the first that has seen a judge order a man to be sterilised. The . decision is the latest in a series of controversial judgements made by . the court, which has been criticised for making secret rulings about . people who are unable to manage their own affairs.","Man, referred to as 'DE', and his girlfriend already have a son born in 2010 .

"The media portrayal of African Americans has come under heavy scrutiny in the wake of the police killing of unarmed teenager Michael Brown as many outlets used a photo of the teen throwing what could be perceived as a gang sign instead of a clearer, more thoughtful photo. The 18-year-old died after he was shot by a police officer in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri, sparking looting and riots across the city. Now African Americans across the country have started posting contrasting images of themselves to Twitter along with the hashtag #iftheygunnedmedown, in protest to the way the media portrays black people. Scroll down for videos . The media portrayal of Michael Brown (pictured), who was killed when he was shot by police, has come under scrutiny after a picture of him making a hand gesture (right) was used by media organisations . Lawyer CJ Lawrence was the first to use the hashtag, when he posted it to Twitter along with these two pictures of himself, to pose the question which would be used in media reports if he was shot dead . Lawyer CJ Lawrence was the first to use the hashtag when he posted it along with a picture of him speaking at his university graduation, alongside former president Bill Clinton, as well as a picture of him dressed as a rapper at a Halloween party. The question poses which picture the media would choose to use if he was shot and became the subject of a news report. According to BBC Trending, Mr Lawrence described how while the question was a rhetorical one, 'in reality it's something we ask ourselves every day as African Americans.' Mr Lawrence said he decided to raise the issue after becoming frustrated by the pictures used by the media of Mr Brown in news reports of his killing. Mr Lawrence said while a graduation picture was widely used initially, an image of Mr Brown wearing a sports top and appearing to make a hand gesture, which could have been interpreted by some as a gang-sign, became more popular in subsequent reports. The hashtag has now been used by dozens of  Twitter users posting two pictures of themselves in different situations. Dozens of Twitter users have now posted images of themselves in different situations. Twitter user @WhoISdeante posted these two pictures along with the hashtag . Twitter . user @dsonoiki posted these two pictures along with the hashtag . #iftheygunnedmedown and the question 'which pic would the news use' Another Twitter user posted these two pictures along with the hashtag, and asked: 'What picture would they choose? Would they paint me as a honor graduate or bandana wearing thug?' In one picture, the poster is usually in what could be seen as a 'positive' role, while in the other image the Twitter user is in what could be regarded as a 'negative' role. The posts pose the question, which image would be used in their portrayal in the media if they were shot in a similar incident which led to the death of Mr Brown. The FBI has opened an investigation into Mr Brown's death, looking into possible civil rights violations. Witnesses have said that Mr Brown had his hands raised when the unidentified officer approached with his weapon drawn and fired repeatedly. Mr Brown's parents have been among those calling for calm. His family members, who had planned to drop him off at a technical college on Monday to begin his studies, have asked people to share any information and videos they might have related to the shooting. Authorities have so far been vague about exactly what led the officer to open fire, except to say that the shooting - which is being investigated by the St. Louis County police at the smaller city's request - was preceded by a scuffle of some kind with a man in which the officer's weapon discharged one time inside a patrol car. Investigators have refused to publicly disclose the race of the officer, who is now on administrative leave. But Phillip Walker said he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he heard a shot and saw a white officer with Mr Brown on the street. The hashtag has now been used by dozens of Twitter users posting two pictures of themselves in different situations . Mr Brown 'was giving up in the sense of raising his arms and being subdued,' Mr Walker told The Associated Press. The officer 'had his gun raised and started shooting the individual in the chest multiple times.' The officer then 'stood over him and shot him' after the victim fell wounded. Dorian Johnson offered a similar account, telling KMOV-TV that he and Mr Brown were walking home from a convenience store when a police officer told them to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk. Mr Johnson said they kept walking, which caused the officer to confront them from his car and again after getting out of the vehicle. Mr Johnson said the first time the officer fired, he and Mr Brown got scared and ran away. 'He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and he started to get down,' Mr Johnson said. 'But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.' 'We wasn't causing harm to nobody,' Mr Johnson said. 'We had no weapons on us at all.' A .

Some civil rights leaders have drawn comparisons between Mr Brown's death and that of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was fatally shot by a Florida neighborhood watch volunteer who was later acquitted of murder charges. 'Instead of celebrating his future, they are having to plan his funeral,' said Benjamin Crump, a family attorney who also represented Mr Martin's relatives after he was slain in 2012 in Florida. 'I don't want to sugarcoat it,' Mr Crump added. Mr Brown 'was executed in broad daylight.'

Officers used tear gas and shot 'beanbag rounds' meant to stun them, he said. St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said there were at least five arrests and no reports of looting. Nearly three dozen people had been arrested following a candlelight vigil Sunday night when crowds burned stores, vandalized vehicles, assaulted reporters and taunted officers. 'People are tired. They have reached the end of their rope,' said Ruth Latchison Nichols after the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People forum, where many more were left waiting outside once the pews reached capacity. 'Enough is enough. This is a state of emergency.' National NAACP President Cornell William Brooks implored residents to 'turn your anger into action' while condemning a violent response to Mr Brown's death. 'To sneak around under the cover of darkness, to steal, to loot, to burn down your neighborhood - this does not require courage,' he said. 'Courage is when you strive for justice.' 'Martin Luther King did not live and die so that we may steal and lie in the middle of the night,' he added.","Lawyer CJ Lawrence started a hashtag to protest Michael Brown's portrayal .

"For many, it was a period of financial turmoil as banks failed, stock markets tumbled and millions lost their jobs. However, billionaire Warren Buffett kept on doing what he does best and began investing in a handful of blue-chip companies during the financial crisis. Five years on and the value of those deals are clear for all to see, America’s second richest man earning another $10 billion thanks to his choice investments. Shrewd: Billionaire Warren Buffett tossed lifelines to a handful of blue-chip companies during the financial crisis . And I made this much!  Five years later, the payoff on those deals is becoming clear: $10 billion and counting . Buffet's boost: Berkshire Hathaway's investments are paying off. From an investment of $25bn dollars, almost $10bn in profits have been realized . Although it proves that the rich are getting richer, it also confirms that wisdom of one of Mr Buffett's favorite investing maxims: ‘Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.’ The fall of 2008, when the market was shaky and confidence was low, a number of stocks of companies that had decent reputations, were at record lows including Wells Fargo & Co. and American Express Co. ‘You make your best buys when people are overwhelmingly fearful,’ Mr Buffet said. ‘In terms of simple profitability, an average investor could have done just as well investing in the stock market if they bought during the panic period,’ Mr. Buffett said in an interview to the Wall Street Journal, but few investors, if any, were able to navigate the choppy financial waters quite as expertly. Sweet smell of success: Buffet decided to invest in a few major companies and is now seeing a profit of $10 billion and counting . By comparison, the U.S. government invested about $420 billion through its Troubled Asset Relief Program. The government also demanded beneficial terms and collected sizable dividend payments for a return of about $50 billion, or 12%, thus far, according to the U.S. Treasury's website. The latest windfall for the Omaha, Nebraska billionaire and his conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., came when candy maker Mars Inc. repaid $4.4 billion that its subsidiary, Wrigley, borrowed in 2008. That payment alone is expected to net Berkshire a profit of at least $680 million. Mr. Buffett said he hopes to use the cash to make other big investments soon that will bring equally attractive returns. Berkshire will continue to buy stocks to add to its portfolio of over $100 billion, because ‘it's still better to have equities than cash,’ he said. It all began with Mars in April of 2008, when credit markets began to tighten their belts, however, what meant even more to companies that were craving much-needed capital was Mr Buffet. However In addition to much-needed capital, the companies acquired something equally valuable: Mr. Buffett's implicit endorsement of their long-term prospects. Call the midas touch if you will - shares of these companies generally went up after they revealed Berkshire's involvement. In six major deals, Berkshire invested a total of about $26 billion. Mr. Buffett used Berkshire's gigantic cash hoard to move swiftly and exact lucrative terms that created a stream of payments from the borrowers. Mr. Buffett's deal-making started in the early days of the crisis and continued deep into the recovery. The last of the deals was a 2011 loan to Bank of America Corp. for $5 billion. Besides Mars and Bank of America, Berkshire made investments in Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Swiss Re Ltd., Dow Chemical Co., and General Electric Co. Several deals are continuing to pay hefty dividends. Cool head: When most panicked during the financial crisis, Warren Buffett invested . As the economy has recovered, and with credit available at more attractive rates, some of the companies have opted to redeem securities owned by Berkshire or adjust the terms in ways favorable to Mr. Buffett. For example, Berkshire became one of Goldman’s largest shareholders with a $2.1 billion stake after the close of a five-year deal in which Berkshire injected $5 billion into the bank. The deal required the bank to pay $500 million in annual dividends. When Goldman redeemed the shares in March 2011, it paid Berkshire an extra $500 million as a premium. Berkshire helped Mars finance its $23 billion purchase of Wrigley. Berkshire contributed $6.5 billion, including $2.1 billion for preferred stock in Wrigley that pays an annual dividend. Berkshire also bought an additional $1 billion of Wrigley debt later. Tthe investment is expected to net Berkshire nearly $4 billion, including annual dividends and a prepayment premium since the bonds were due in 2018. In another display of Mr Buffett's ingenuity, Berkshire invested $5 billion in Bank of America which adds about $300 million in annual pretax income. The deal allowed Buffet to purchase another 700 million shares for an additional $5 billion at $7.14 a share. Given the bank's current stock price at about $14, it would create a further profit of $5 billion. When it comes to affairs of government Mr Buffett doesn’t believe holding congress to ransom is the way to pass legislation. ‘It makes absolutely no sense for politicians to use the debt ceiling as a threat to get their way on other legislation. It ought to be banned as a weapon. It should be like nuclear bombs, basically too horrible to use,’ he said in an interview with Fortune. If Congress doesn’t increase the country's borrowing power by October 17, the government won’t have enough money to pay its bills, according to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. Defaulting on the nation's debt could trigger a global financial meltdown. ‘We will go right up to the point of extreme idiocy, but we won’t cross it,’ the Oracle of Omaha said last week.","Buffett invested in well known companies at record lows in 2008 .

"The document suggests that the MoD should ¿reduce the profile of the repatriation ceremonies¿ as they reduce support for war . Repatriation ceremonies for the remains of dead soldiers should have a lower profile in order to make war more palatable to the British public, according to a report for the Ministry of Defence. It examines how to sway ‘casualty averse’ public opinion, a situation commonly known as 'body bag syndrome', and was published by the MoD’s strategy formulation unit. The document suggests that the MoD should ‘reduce the profile of the repatriation ceremonies’ where coffins carrying deceased soldiers are brought back to UK bases such as RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. It discusses ways to ‘reduce public sensitivity’ and methods of explaining that ‘risks are knowingly and willingly undertaken’ by armed forces personnel. Suggestions included making greater use of the SAS and other special forces, as well as mercenaries, because it claims losses sustained by the elite soldiers and hired guns do not have the same impact on the public and press. 'Neither the media nor the public in the west appear to identify with contractors in the way that they do with their military personnel. Thus casualties from within the contractorised force are more acceptable in pursuit of military ends than those from among our own forces.' It added: 'The public appear to have a more robust attitude to SF [special forces] losses.' Reassurances are made in the paper that the British public may not be as ‘risk-averse’ as they appear, and suggests this is ‘based on recent, post-2000 experience’. ‘Historically, once the public are convinced that they have a stake in the conflict they are prepared to endorse military risks and will accept casualties as the necessary consequence of the use of military force,’ it says. The report adds: ‘The public have become better informed and our opponents more sophisticated in the exploitation of the sources of information with the net result that convincing the nation of the need to run military risks has become more difficult but no less essential.’ The report also recommends the increased us of drones to reduce casualties . The report, written in 2012 and released under the Freedom of Information Act, has been met with criticism by relatives of soldiers killed while serving their country. Deborah Allbutt, whose husband Stephen was killed in a friendly fire incident in Iraq in 2003, described the proposals for repatriation ceremonies as ‘brushing the deaths under the carpet’. She told The Guardian: ‘They are fighting and giving their lives. Why should they be hidden away? It would be absolutely disgraceful.’ The deaths of mercenaries, or 'private military contractors' do not affect the public psyche as keenly as military personnel. File picture . Allbutt, with others, gained a landmark ruling this year that relatives of killed or injured soldiers can seek damages under human rights legislation. An MoD spokesman said: ‘It is entirely right that we publicly honour those who have made the ultimate sacrifice and there are no plans to change the way in which repatriation ceremonies are conducted. ‘A key purpose of the development, concepts and doctrine centre is to produce research which tests and challenges established doctrine and its papers are designed to stimulate internal debate, not outline government policy or positions. To represent this paper as policy or a potential shift of policy is misleading.’","Report says images of flag-draped coffins reduces support for military action .

"SFO paid Miss Williamson £98,946 for her to travel down and stay in a London hotel for three days a week between 2008 and 2012 . Taxpayers paid travel and hotel bills of nearly £100,000 so the CEO of a fraud and corruption watchdog could commute to London from the Lake District, a report reveals today. Phillippa Williamson, the now-former chief executive officer of the Serious Fraud Office, was also given an ‘irregular’ £407,000 pension top-up that did not go through the proper approval process. The report, which described the SFO as a case study in ‘how not to run a public body’, found that Miss Williamson was allowed to work from home in the picturesque Lake District. The SFO paid £98,946 for her to travel down and stay in a London hotel for three days a week between 2008 and 2012. MPs on the Public Accounts Committee, which produced the report, have condemned the ‘astounding’ working conditions afforded staff at the body. Three senior staff taking voluntary redundancy were offered severance packages worth £1million without the required approval being sought from the Cabinet Office or the Treasury. Miss Williamson received a total of £464,905, the chief capability officer Christian Bailes was handed £437,167 and the head of technology Ian McCall received £49,885. The decisions on pay-outs and redundancies were made by the former director and accounting officer, Richard Alderman. He retired in April last year, four days after Miss Williamson left the SFO. He was accused of showing a ‘disregard for the proper use of taxpayers’ money’. Richard Bacon, a Tory MP on the committee, said: ‘The reputation of the Serious Fraud Office has been undermined by a catalogue of errors and poor judgement, and the morale of its staff has suffered as a result.’ The MP said of Mr Alderman that, ‘By . deciding the size of severance packages, and not seeking alternative . placements for staff, he failed to follow due process.’ The committee . particularly criticised the golden goodbyes given the three senior . staff. Mr McCall’s package included £34,450 to which he was ‘not . contractually entitled’. Damning report found that Miss Williamson was allowed to work from home in the picturesque Lake District . Mr Alderman also decided on a £15,000 special payment each to Miss Williamson and Mr Bailes so as to avoid grievance actions, despite legal advice that there were no such claims to be made. Miss Williamson had been hand-picked for the role by Mr Alderman, as they had previously been colleagues elsewhere in the civil service. No records were kept on why she was given the job, nor on a subsequent promotion. The report found that the former director’s actions had taken place in a culture where ‘external advice and scrutiny was to be avoided wherever possible and with an apparent need for secrecy’. Confidentiality clauses were used in the severance packages. Labour’s Emily Thornberry, Shadow Attorney General, said that Mr Alderman should be pursued for ‘squandering’ £1million. She called on the Attorney General to charge him with misconduct in public office. She said: ‘I am pleased that the PAC share my concerns about what has been going on at the SFO and that they have investigated thoroughly. ‘However, it’s still the case that no-one has been held accountable for this or has had to pay anything back.’ In a gruelling session the committee held while compiling the report, it also emerged that Mr Alderman had embarked on 12 foreign trips taking 52 days in his final year. He visited China, the Philippines and Tanzania while researching the Bribery Act, he told MPs. Labour MP Austin Mitchell told him at the time: ‘It looks to me, from the outside, like this is an organisation run by lawyers for lawyers and the prolongation of their perks and predilection for easy money.’ After the session, Mr Alderman wrote to the committee acknowledging MPs were ‘justified’ in criticising him and offering his ‘deep and unreserved apology’.","Taxpayers paid nearly £100,000 so Phillippa Williamson could commute .

"Billions of pounds of British aid money is paid with almost no checks on how it is spent, MPs warned last night. Ministers have been urged to do ‘much more’ to safeguard the £4.9billion a year given to agencies  after hearing that officials make only two visits to inspect countries where the UK does not have its own aid programme. Britain gives 60 per cent of its aid – one of the highest levels – through agencies such as  the World Bank, European Union and United Nations who decide how  to use the money. Worrying: Billions of pounds of British aid money is paid with almost no checks on how it is spent, MPs warned last night . The US prefers to have direct control – through bilateral arrangements – of how its money is spent and only gives 26 per cent of its aid to multilateral groups. In a highly critical report by the Commons international development committee, MPs said they were shocked that British officials made only two visits to see for themselves how the money was spent. Committee chairman Sir Malcolm Bruce said: ‘We accept that country visits are not the only way of gathering evidence. ‘For a number of multilateral organisations, the UK has a seat on the board, which obviously provides us with some oversight. ‘Nevertheless, we feel strongly that... the team should undertake more visits to countries in which the UK has no bilateral programmes.’ The Department for International Development (Dfid) has boasted of slashing the administration costs on its own projects to around three per cent. Expensive: Britain gives 60 per cent of its aid - one of the highest levels - through agencies such as  the World Bank, European Union and United Nations, pictured, who decide how  to use the money . But MPs said this misleading because so much aid cash is now spent with organisations whose costs are often at least twice as high. The report warned cost cutting at home was creating ‘a perverse incentive for Dfid to allocate more of its money to multilaterals, many of whose administration costs are far higher for the wrong reasons.’ It went on: ‘Dfid’s allocation of funding should not be guided by the desire to “export” its own administration costs.’ MPs also voiced surprise that Dfid had continued to fund a series of organisations despite warning two years ago that they offered poor value for money. A major review by Dfid in 2011 found that nine of the organisations it funded, including five run by the United Nations were performing poorly. But despite this Dfid has continued to fund four of them. A further nine organisations given the second lowest rating of ‘adequate’ have had their funding increased by £97million, equal to a 12 per cent rise. Dfid last night defended its approach to funding multilateral organisations, but said the process was kept under constant review. A statement said: ‘The Multilateral Aid Review process, introduced by this Government, provides a rigorous assessment of the value for money of multilateral agencies and is a model that has been adopted internationally. ‘We remain determined to get better value for money and more effective aid from multilateral agencies.’","Ministers urged to do .

"The night four Americans - including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens - were killed during a terrorist in Benghazi, Libya, last year, there reportedly were dozens of CIA operatives on the ground near the scene that night - and now the spy agency is going to great lengths to keep whatever they were doing there a secret. According to published reports, since January, several CIA operatives involved in the missions in Libya have been forced to submit to multiple polygraph tests - in some cases, operatives were given a test on a monthly basis. According to sources with direct knowledge of the situation, the agency is questioning operatives to find out whether they are talking about Benghazi with the media or with members of Congress, which just demanded that an investigation into the terrorist attack be a priority of the FBI's new director, James Comey. What Happened? Nobody seems to know exactly what happened during the Benghazi attack - and the CIA seems to want to keep it that way . According to CNN - which broke the story about the number of operatives on the ground the night of the attack, and the CIA's frequent use of polygraphs - a CNN operative who passes information on to Congress or the media faces career-ending consequences. One of CNN's sources described the CIA's attempts to keep elements of the Benghazi attack as 'unprecendented.' 'You have no idea the amount of pressure being brought to bear on anyone with knowledge of this operation,' one source said. Another source described the CIA's tactics as 'pure intimidation.' In internal communications obtained by the network, one insider writes, 'You don't jeopardize yourself, you jeopardize your family as well.' Tragedy: U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed in the terrorist attack on the embassy in Benghazi . Terror: The Obama Administration refused to call the Benghazi attack 'terror' for several weeks after the assault . According to former CIA operative and CNN analyst Robert Baer, agents are generally questioned once every three to four years, 'never more than that.' 'If somebody is being polygraphed every month, or every two months it's . called an issue polygraph, and that means that the polygraph division . suspects something, or they're looking for something, or they're on a . fishing expedition. But it's absolutely not routine at all to be . polygraphed monthly, or bi-monthly,' Baer continued. The CIA denies that it is trying to keep things from Congress. In a statement, CIA spokesman Dean Boyd insists that the agency has 'worked closely with its oversight committees to provide them with an . extraordinary amount of information related to the attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi.' 'CIA employees are always free to speak to Congress if they want,' the . statement continued. 'The CIA enabled all officers involved in Benghazi . the opportunity to meet with Congress. We are not aware of any CIA . employee who has experienced retaliation, including any non-routine . security procedures, or who has been prevented from sharing a concern . with Congress about the Benghazi incident.' According to one CNN source, there were as many as 35 CIA operatives on the ground in Benghazi on the night of the attack, with up to seven wounded, in some cases seriously. At least 21 were in the building known as the Annex. Foreign Serviceman Sean Smith also was killed during the attack . The actual number of operatives in Benghazi that night remains a mystery, though, as well as what - exactly - they were doing there. 'We should have the people who were on the scene come in, testify under . oath, do it publicly, and lay it out. And there really isn't any . national security issue involved with regards to that,' Congressman Frank Wolf - who has been seeking answers about what happened in Benghazi for over a year. 'I think it is a form of a cover-up, and I think it's an attempt to push . it under the rug, and I think the American people are feeling the same . way,' he continued. Answers: Congressman Frank Wolf wants people on the ground the night of the attack to testify under oath before Congress . Wolf also says that in the immediate aftermath of the attack, there were several people with close ties to CIA operatives and contractors who contacted him wanting to talk. Now, he said, there is silence. 'Initially they were not afraid to come forward. They wanted the . opportunity, and they wanted to be subpoenaed, because if you're . subpoenaed, it sort of protects you, you're forced to come before . Congress.

"For the first time in a century, it seems people in the U.S. are leaving the suburbs for cities. Since the invention of the automobile in 1888, the rate of suburban . population growth has consistently outpaced that of urban centers. But in 2011 - for the first time in a hundred years - the trend reversed. Demographics, environmental concerns and rising energy costs all play roles, according to The End of the Suburbs: Where the American Dream is Moving, a new book that charts the rise and fall of American suburbia. End of the white picket fence? Since the invention of the automobile, the rate of suburban population growth has outpaced that of urban centers. But in 2011 - for the first time in a hundred years - the trend reversed . 'Powerful . social trends are shrinking and transforming the American nuclear . family, long the dominant driver of suburbia,' wrote the author, Leigh Gallagher. 'Simply speaking, more . and more Americans don’t want to live there anymore.' Originally,  suburbs were quaint, tree-lined villages. But the post-World War II housing shortage, and low-interest loans for the middle class led to the suburban house becoming as much a part of the American Dream as two kids and a dog. Moving . out: Some experts say that the era of cookie-cutter suburban homes that have been iconic of the . American dream since the 1950s may be . over forever . As suburbs grew, so to did 'a lack of cultural amenities', explains Ms Gallagher, who is also the Assistant Managing Editor of Fortune magazine. Suburbs, she says, lead to 'miles and miles of Ruby . Tuesdays', and longer and longer commutes. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the average American takes 25.4minutes to get to work . every day - and 10.8million face trips of more than an hour. But rising energy costs mean that for many people, these trips are becoming less economical. Battered by the job market, some young people - nicknamed 'Generation Rent' because they are, increasingly, delaying home ownership - are also choosing to settle in diverse urban areas. Changing . demographics: Since the 1950s the suburb system has depended on cars . and highways, but now high energy costs are making long commutes . unaffordable for many people . 'Construction permit data shows . that in several cities, building activity that was once concentrated in . the suburban fringe has now shifted primarily to cities, or what . planners call the ""urban core""', Ms Gallagher writes.

"The owner of the World Trade Center is arguing in federal court that the airlines who planes were flown into the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001 should pay him billions in compensation. Larry Silverstein is attempting to collect $3.5billion from United Airlines, US Airways and American Airlines - on top of nearly $5billion he has already received from his insurance company. U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein in Manhattan is listening to arguments on both sides before he will rule on whether Silverstein's World Trade Center Properties can file a lawsuit against the airlines. He is expected to rule from the bench as soon as several witnesses conclude . testifying in the trial expected to last about three days. Arguments began on Monday. Total loss: Larry Silverstein, who is the principle owner of the World Trade Center, has been paid nearly $5billion by his insurance companies after the towers collapsed . Silverstein, who is developing the new World Trade Center, is hoping a judge will grant him legal standing to sue the airlines involved in the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks . Lawyers for the owners argued during opening statements that the money they already have received does not preclude them from separately pursuing damages against aviation companies. Attorney Roger Podesta, who represents the airlines, said the $3.5 billion being sought for destruction of the twin towers and a third skyscraper would amount to double compensation. He said an $8.5 billion total recovery would be more than 2 1/2 times the fair value of the buildings that fell. Attorney Richard Williamson, representing World Trade Center Properties, said accounting and construction experts had assessed damages of at least $7.2 billion from the September 11, 2001 attacks. One World Trade Center, which topped out earlier this year and became the tallest building in the western hemisphere, cost an estimated $3.9billion. It is slated to open in early 2014. The new One World Trade Center, the third-tallest building in the world, cost $3.9 billion. It is expected to open nearly next year . 'This did not just come out of a hat.' he said of the damage figures. 'You can't just say, ""I have economic loss.""' The trade center owners say it has cost more than $7 billion to replace the twin towers and more than $1 billion to replace the third trade center building that fell. The trial's first witness was Michael S. Beach, a claims expert hired by the aviation companies who spent hours explaining to the court how the loss was calculated. In court papers, both sides have accused the other of unfairly characterizing their claims. Should Hellerstein decide the claims do not correspond with each other, Silverstein would then have to prove liability in a separate trial. Hellerstein, a Bronx native and U.S. Army veteran nominated to the bench by President Bill Clinton, has presided over a sprawling portfolio of 9/11-related cases. In January, Hellerstein will hear a trial pitting Cantor Fitzgerald, which lost 658 employees in the attacks, against American Airlines. The financial services firm sued the airline over lost business and the destruction of its offices in the World Trade Center.","Larry Silverstein, the owner of the World Trade Center, is seeking $3.5billion from United Airlines, US Airways and American Airlines .

"Brussels is offering British firms cash ‘bribes’ of almost £1,000 a time to take on foreign workers. Thousands of youngsters are also being offered payments totalling more than £1,100 to take a job in Britain under the European Commission scheme. The extraordinary initiative appears to directly undermine Government efforts to persuade firms to take on British workers as the recovery takes hold. In an interview with the Daily Mail yesterday the Business Minister Matthew Hancock said firms had a duty to hire Britons rather than taking the ‘easy option’ of filling vacancies with well-trained foreign workers. The joint initiative between British JobCentres and the European Commission offer incentives including £870 for every EU citizen employed by a UK firm and a grant of £260 for applicants to travel to Britain for an interview . Firms taking on non-UK workers qualify for a payment from Brussels worth up to £870 for every EU citizen they employ, to help pay for English lessons and other training. Employers can recruit up to 20 foreign workers a year through the EU scheme, which is run with the co-operation of British JobCentres. Jobless youngsters across Europe can qualify for a grant of £260 to travel to Britain for an interview. If they land the job they also qualify for an £870 grant to help with the costs of moving to this country. Yesterday more than 800,000 UK jobs were being advertised through the scheme – more than half the total across Europe. These incentives come at a time when more than half of vacancies in the UK are filled by foreigners. It is not known how many have taken advantage of the EU scheme. A UK Independence Party source said the EU was effectively ‘bribing’ firms to take foreign workers. Party leader Nigel Farage said the initiative was ‘utterly reprehensible’ at a time when youth unemployment in this country stands at nearly one million. He added: ‘With two and a half million people unemployed in the UK, of which 958,000 are under 25, every job vacancy counts. ‘Yet here we have the EU, which we already grossly overfund, advertising our jobs to people outside the UK and even giving them the upper hand by offering financial support to get interviews here and move here. We are essentially paying the EU to give away British jobs.’ Business Minister Matthew Hancock (left) criticised UK firms for taking the 'easy option'. UKIP leader Nigel Farage added fuel to the fire by saying unemployment can't be improved while the UK is a member of the EU . The EU scheme, which was launched last year, is known as EURES, and is designed to help ease the EU’s chronic youth unemployment problem. The UK provides about 13 per cent of the scheme’s budget. Jobs on offer include a wide range of relatively low-skilled vacancies, such as shop work and jobs in the construction industry. In contrast with Britain, France is advertising 48,330 vacancies, Italy 12,193 and Denmark just 197. The scheme is open to all young EU nationals aged 18 to 30 and could attract thousands of youngsters to Britain from struggling southern European countries which have unemployment rates up to three times as high as the UK’s, such as Spain, Greece and Portugal. Mr Hancock yesterday said it is ‘companies’ social duty, to look at employing locally first’. But Mr Farage said the revelations about the Brussels scheme gave the lie to Government claims that immigration could be controlled while remaining in the EU. He added: ‘For the minister to blame British businesses when he is taxing them in order to send the money to Brussels to fund foreign jobseekers to compete with British workers is so unfair as to be outrageous. ‘We have said from the start we simply cannot improve unemployment in the UK while being a member of the EU.’ An EU spokesman stressed that British youngsters were able to use the scheme to access jobs elsewhere in Europe. Posters warning illegal immigrants to ‘go home or face arrest’ have persuaded just one foreigner to leave. An Indian citizen has started the process of voluntary repatriation after spotting the signs, which have been on display in six London boroughs over the past few days. The Home Office yesterday insisted the campaign had started well and that hotline staff had fielded a number of calls. The Lib Dems have called the posters offensive and UKIP leader Nigel Farage said they were a ‘nasty’ gimmick.","Business Minister Matthew Hancock said firms have a duty to hire Britons .

"As a zoologist, explorer and  nature programme presenter, I’ve always loved animals. But when it comes to picking a favourite, I’m not interested in the usual furry pandas or cheeky meerkats. No, in my opinion, the best animals by far are sloths — nature’s most misunderstood creature. Sloths get a lot of undeserved bad press. Let’s face it, being named after one of the seven deadly sins was never going to be a good start. So spa so good: Sloths with skin problems take the occasional splash in green tea, which keeps their skin healthy. They're surprisingly good swimmers, but don't like bathtime and often look very sorry for themselves . They spend more than 70 per cent of their time resting and move incredibly slowly, which means they’re often dismissed as lazy and stupid. But their chilled-out nature is what helps them to survive in the jungles of South America, their native habitat. They are the masters of staying silent and hidden from predators. Beyond the pail: Buckets are the sloth's favourite way to travel at the sanctuary. It's fast and means they can snooze on the move. Naturally solitary in the wild, they're paired up with a sloth 'cuddle partner' when they arrive at the sanctuary, and enjoy chilling out together . Toy story: Babies cling to their mothers for the first 12 months before going it alone, so orphaned sloths get stuffed toys to hug instead. Baby Matteo refuses to be separated from his giraffe called Mr Moo . Sloth style: These little chaps can't control their own body temperature like other mammals, and nights can be chilly for the orphans without a mummy to cling to. So the sanctuary make special onesies, crafted from sports socks, to keep them cosy . They’ve been around for a long time, too: fossils have revealed some of their ancestors grew to the size of elephants, had claws and ate leaves much like the present-day versions. These cuddly couch potatoes are among the smartest, eco-friendliest, cutest and most amazing animals on the planet. And I’m on a one-woman mission to prove it. I’m so passionate about these tree-hugging balls of fluff that in 2010, I travelled thousands of miles from my home in London to Costa Rica, where I visited the Aviarios sloth sanctuary — the world’s first sanctuary for injured and orphaned sloths — to meet 150 of them. Hanging tough: Sloths in the wild spend their lives hanging in trees. Their long arms and four-inch curved claws keep them hooked to the branches. Babies at the sanctuary have a daily workout on the climbing frame . Safe and snuggly: Orphans often arrive with broken bones after falling from trees or being hit by cars, so the sanctuary has its own 'slothspital' to treat injuries . Your cue: Sloths do everything upside down - eating, sleeping, mating, giving birth - and climb down from the trees just once a week to answer the call of nature. So playing a trick shot on the pool table is no problem . Founded 20 years ago, the sanctuary cares for sloths who have fallen from trees (either breaking bones or being separated from the mothers they’d normally cling to for the first year of life), been the victim of attacks by dogs or even run over on the roads that cut across their natural jungle habitat. There, I fell in love with their sweet smiles, slow-mo lifestyles and innate hugability. I vowed to change public attitudes, making people see that being slothful is a virtue, not a sin. I’ve since made a documentary about them called Meet The Sloths for the Animal Planet channel. Where's Wally? This little fellow was rescued by locals and named Wally. He took a long time to learn how to climb upwards. However, he hasn't yet learned to reverse, and often has to be rescued from the top of the climbing frame by members of staff . Basket case: In the wild, sloths eat leaves that would poison other animals - it takes their stomachs four weeks to digest each meal, breaking down the toxins. So, while they might look lazy, inside their bodies are hard at work . I’ve also launched the Sloth Appreciation Society, and even created sloth fans along the way, such as Ricky Gervais and actor Ashton Kutcher, who have spread the word about these wonderful animals on Twitter. Now, I’m sharing my Sloth Sanctuary photo albums with the world in a new book, The Power Of Sloth. Once you’ve read it, I promise you’ll never look at these mellow fellows in the same light. Not convinced? Let me talk you through some of my favourite snaps...

"The long-term unemployed are to be told they must do an unpaid full-time job or be stripped of their benefits . The long-term unemployed are to be told they must do an unpaid full-time job or be stripped of their benefits. A dramatic extension of the conditions attached to unemployment handouts  will be unveiled at the Conservative party conference next week, according to well-placed sources. Ministers are convinced a new US-style ‘work for the dole’ scheme will help to reduce  Britain’s vast benefits bill and curb the something-for-nothing culture. It is expected that claimants who go through the Government’s main back-to-work scheme, the Work Programme, but fail to find a job, will be required to take part in unpaid community activities or work experience. Those who refuse to do so face losing their welfare payments. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith told the Daily Mail: ‘It’s not acceptable for people to expect to live a life on benefits if they’re able to work.’ A poll today finds overwhelming support for stricter conditions for the long-term unemployed. The YouGov survey shows most voters believe jobseekers should carry out work experience or community work in order to receive their benefits. By a margin of nearly five to one – 56 per cent to 12 per cent – they support the introduction of ‘workfare’ for the long-term unemployed compared to the status quo. Two thirds of those questioned – 67 per cent –  felt workless mothers with children under four should be excluded from doing community work in return for benefits. But only one in four – 25 per cent – thought those with mental health conditions who are capable of work should be excluded from workfare, and only one in five – 22 per cent – thought those with physical disabilities who are capable of working should be exempt. However, the centre-Right think tank Policy Exchange, which commissioned the survey of 1,930 people, warned that forcing those with physical and mental health problems to work would be counterproductive. A dramatic extension of the conditions attached to unemployment handouts  will be unveiled at the Conservative party conference next week, according to well-placed sources (stock picture) Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: 'It's not acceptable for people to expect to live a life on benefits if they're able to work' In a report published today, it says the Government should pilot workfare schemes for specific groups of jobseekers, including those who leave the Work Programme without finding a job after at least two years of support, either through lack of effort or experience. Those who work will be allowed to jump the queue for a council house in one city. Would-be tenants with a job of more than 12 hours a week and voluntary workers will get priority in Stoke-on-Trent, along with members of the forces and foster carers. The city council wants to reward those who demonstrate a ‘community contribution’. Council house tenants helped draw up the proposed rules. It also suggests that the scheme should cover under-25s with little or no work experience and older jobseekers who have been out of work for at least six months. The Government has already carried out pilot schemes which suggest significant numbers of jobless claimants would rather lose their handouts than get out of bed and do a stint of unpaid work. Officials suspect many of those who stop claiming are working in the black economy and would rather lose their welfare than give up their undeclared earnings. Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘The welfare state rightly provides a safety net for those out of work. But in return, jobseekers must do everything they can to get into work, that’s only fair.’ Ed Holmes, senior economics fellow at Policy Exchange, said: ‘Making people work in return for their benefits is clearly popular with the public but workfare is not suitable for everyone. ‘These findings underline that fact that the public feel it shouldn’t be the responsibility of government to prop people up and find them work.’ Figures yesterday showed an increasing number of long-term jobless have found employment under the Government’s flagship back-to-work scheme. More than 168,000 have been helped into a lasting job through the Work Programme to the end of June. The figure is an increase of 37,000 in the three months to June, said the Department for Work and Pensions.","A US-style ‘work for dole’ scheme could reduce Britain’s vast benefits bill .

"Two star: Elaine West, who joined the RAF aged 17, has been promoted to air vice-marshal . A woman who joined the RAF straight from school at 17 has made history by becoming the first female two-star officer in Britain’s Armed Forces. Elaine West, 51, has been promoted to air vice-marshal – the highest military rank ever held by a woman in the UK. She has been appointed a director at the Defence Infrastructure Organisation and will oversee multimillion-pound military infrastructure projects and schemes to improve defence capability, and manage the withdrawal of army units from Germany. Air Vice-Marshal West, who is married with a teenage son, joined the RAF in the lowest rank of aircraftwoman in 1978. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said her promotion showed there were no ‘glass ceilings’ for female officers. He said: 'We need the best and the brightest talent in senior positions as we transform defence over the next few years as we build Future Force 2020 and that means selecting people from across defence, irrespective of gender. 'I am pleased that we are demonstrating in defence that there are no ""glass ceilings"" for female officers who have the necessary abilities to rise to the senior ranks.' Air Vice-Marshal West joined the RAF in late 1978 in the lowest rank as an aircraftwoman. She has worked in more than 18 roles and served in bases across the world. She said: 'It is with enormous pride that I take up my new appointment as Director of Projects and Programme Delivery within the Defence Infrastructure Organisation. 'I am privileged to have served in the RAF and to have enjoyed so many challenging roles over the years. 'To now be the first female military two-star is a truly unexpected bonus. Inspiration: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said Elaine West's success proved there was 'no glass ceiling' for women in the Armed Forces . 'I know so many inspirational women across all three services who continue to make a substantial contribution to operations and our armed forces more widely. 'This is a terrific opportunity and one that I’m looking forward to immensely.' Before Air Vice-Marshal West’s promotion, the highest rank held by a regular serving female officer in the modern-day RAF was Air Commodore - a one-star post. In predecessor organisations, the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) and Women’s Royal Air Force (WRAF), there had been a two star rank of Air Chief Commandant. The highest ranking female officer in the navy has been Commodore and the highest rank achieved by a woman in the army has been Brigadier, the MoD said. Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford said: 'Elaine West’s promotion to the rank of Air Vice-Marshal is thoroughly well deserved and I wish her every success in her challenging role within the Defence Infrastructure Organisation. 'The Royal Air Force is proud of its record as an equal opportunities employer, we were recognised most recently by the Times as one of the UK’s top 50 female employers, and it is fantastic to see more female officers reaching top positions within the service. 'The vast majority of roles in the armed forces are open to women and I would encourage everyone, regardless of gender to take full advantage of the opportunities available to them within the military.'","Elaine West first ever female two-star officer .

"Diamond selling giant De Beers is holding its final 'sight' in London this week as it prepares to move its auction rooms to southern Africa. The company's international sales operations, which represents 85 out of 300 London-based De Beers employees, are due to move to Gaborone, the Botswana capital, from next month. The company handpicks 80 buyers to buy rough gems from its mines under a system of pre-determined allocations and regular sales meetings known as 'sights', which from next month will also be held in Africa. Big move: The De Beers sales operation is to move from London to Gaborone, the capital of Botswana, from next month . Trading places: Diamond buyer Elliot Tannenbaum, from the Leo Schachter Diamond Group, sorts bags of uncut diamonds at a sightholders week at De Beers offices in London . Cost: The decision to move, made in 2011, will cost nearly £74million and follows years of negotiations between De Beers and Botswana . The final week of sights to be held in London was due to end tomorrow. The decision to move, made in 2011, will cost nearly £74million, which includes new offices in Gaborone, and follows years of negotiations between Anglo-American-owned De Beers and Botswana, the largest producer of gem diamonds. The move has been hailed as the 'end of an era'. De Beers, founded by Cecil Rhodes in 1888, started trading in London towards the end of the 1930s. Kieron Hodgson, equity analyst at . Charles Stanley in London, said: 'It is what you would call the end of . an era, but it should not be seen as a negative, it should be seen as . the natural progression of the industry.' But RBC Capital Markets analyst Des Kilalea said: 'I don't think any of them really want to be (in Gaborone), but they don't have a choice as the diamonds are in the ground there. 'It . is akin to saying we won't have a London Metal Exchange, you'll have to . go to Chile to get your copper. It is blatantly inefficient - though in . terms of politics and development, if I were president I'd do the . same.' Take-over: Anglo American last year took over De Beers after agreeing to buy the 40 per cent stake from the Oppenheimer family in a £3.2billion deal . Sales: The move will shift more than £3.7 billion of annual rough diamond sales from London to Gaborone . Operations: De Beers has already moved its diamond sorting and aggregation businesses . Veteran diamantaire Elliot Tannenbaum, . founder of the Leo Schachter group, which is one of the buyers picked by De . Beers, said: 'I have been coming here some ten times a year for 35 . years, I have missed only two or three sights. It is part of our . routine.' The move secured a new 10-year contract for the sorting, valuing and sales of diamonds from the Botswana mines run by Debswana, a split venture between De Beers and the southern African country's government. It will shift more than £3.7 billion of annual rough diamond sales from London to Gaborone. By separating the sales from the corporate headquarters, the move is arguably the biggest challenge De Beers has faced to the way it does business since the current sales model was set up nearly a century ago. 'It is what you would call the end of . an era, but it should not be seen as a negative, it should be seen as . the natural progression of the industry' - Kieron Hodgson, equity analyst at . Charles Stanley in London . Anglo American last year took over De Beers after agreeing to buy the 40 per cent stake from the Oppenheimer family in a £3.2billion deal. The remaining 15 per cent is owned by the Botswana government, which could exercise a right to raise its stake to 25 per cent. Such a development would take Anglo’s stake back down to 75 per cent, Anglo said. De Beers has already moved its diamond sorting and aggregation businesses - the operations that sift through the production from each mine and bring the gems together before they are allocated to buyers - to Gaborone. It has also supported cutting and polishing operations by making more diamonds available locally - encouraging international firms like Tannenbaum's to grow there. The Leo Schachter group now employs some 300 people in Botswana. De Beers' London sights date back to the 1930s, when it set up what became the Diamond Trading Company to control supply, secure demand and tighten its grip on the market in rough diamonds. Approach: Varda Shine (pictured), who runs De Beers' Global Sightholder Sales, said the Botswana government told De Beers it would like the company to sell Botswana diamonds in the country . Until this month, the London sales meetings were interrupted only by the heavy bombing during the Blitz. But De Beers has been battling lower production and challenges to its sales model for years, in part thanks the collapse of the Soviet Union and the emergence of mines in Australia and Canada outside the firm's influence. Its share of rough diamond sales dropped to under 50 percent in 2006 and to 37 percent in 2012, according to consultancy Bain. In 2009, it was overtaken in carat terms by Russia's Alrosa. De Beers says the move to Gaborone was partly motivated by wanting to keep alive the sights system, which still sells to buyers like jewellers Tiffany & Co and China's Chow Tai Fook, and Indian family firms. Varda Shine, who runs De Beers' Global Sightholder Sales, said: 'The Botswana government did not come to De Beers and say please transfer your business. 'The Botswana government said we would like you to sell the Botswana diamonds here. 'We believe our business model is quite strong and provides value for De Beers and its shareholders - so we came up with the idea of moving the whole business.'","Diamond trader De Beers is heading to Botswana in £74million move .

"Forget hacking accounts, computers or mobile devices - security engineers from Indiana have managed to hack the software inside the Toyota Prius and Ford Escape. Using a laptop wirelessly connected to the car's electronics, Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek were able to remotely control the brakes, the accelerator, change the speedometer, switch the headlights on and off, tighten the seatbelts and even blast the horn. The project was funded by a grant from the U.S Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to highlight the security risks affecting modern-day cars. Scroll down for video . Engineers from Indiana previously managed to hack the software that runs the electronics in a 2010 Toyota Prius and Ford Escape, pictured, so that the brakes, steering, speedometer and the car's electronics can be controlled remotely using a laptop . Commands included: . Remotely honking the horn. Accelerating and braking. Turning headlights on and off. Tightening the seatbelts. Disabling power steering. Changing the speedometer and petrol gauge. Preventing the car from powering down so to drain the battery. Miller, a security engineer at Twitter, and Valasek, Director of Security Intelligence at IOActive, are due to officially announce their findings at the Def Con 21 conference in Vegas the weekend of the 1-3 August. However, they have given Forbes journalist Andy Greenberg a preview by taking him for a test ride in their hijacked vehicle. According to Greenberg, the majority of American car manufacturers provide a mobile or Wi-Fi network in their vehicles. Many cars additionally come with built-in software that runs on an operating system in a similar way to phones and computers. These include the 2010 models of the Ford Escape running the Ford SYNC software, and the Toyota Prius' Safety Connect. By hacking this network and exploiting Bluetooth bugs this software becomes hackable and makes it possible to send remote code executions from a mobile device. Remote code executions let people remotely control the car's features. Using a laptop wirelessly connected to a Toyota Prius' electronics, the engineers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek were able to remotely control the brakes, the accelerator, change the speedometer, switch the headlights on and off, tighten the seatbelts and even blast the horn . During his hour-long test drive, Miller and Valasek demonstrated to Greenberg they could send commands from their laptop to accelerate to high speeds before slamming the brakes on. The pair also disabled the power steering, tricked the GPS into thinking it was in a different location, adjusted the speedometer and honk the horn -  all remotely. The steering, for example, was hacked by exploiting the Toyota and Ford's self-parking features. Toyota said 'it isn't impressed' with Miller and Valasek's hack and claimed its systems were robust and secure. A Ford spokesman said they were taking the hack 'very seriously'. Researchers from the University of Washington and the University of California, San Diego were the first to publish findings into hacking software in cars in 2010. Valasek told Greenberg: 'Academics have shown you can get remote code execution. We showed you can do a lot of crazy things once you’re inside.'","Security engineers have managed to hack the software in a Toyota Prius .

"The number of people out of work for more than a year has hit the highest level for 17 years, new figures showed today. But long-term unemployment hit 915,000 in June, marking a return to levels last seen in 1996. The revelation overshadowed figures showing that the total jobless number fell by 57,000 in the quarter to May to 2.51 million, the lowest since last autumn. Long-term unemployment hit 915,000 in June, marking a return to levels last seen 17 years ago despite falls in the overall number of people without a job . Unions warned of the ‘misery’ faced by those without work for over 12 months. Most of the economic figures from the Office for National Statistics were positive, with more people finding jobs and more vacancies. The number of people claiming Jobseekers Allowance also fell to 1.478million, the lowest level since March 2011 and lower than at the election in May 2010. But just over 460,000 people have been jobless for more than two years, the highest figure since 1997. The number of people classed as economically inactive also increased in the latest quarter, up by 87,000 to 9.04 million. The figure included a 44,000 increase in economically inactive students, a 26,000 rise among the long-term sick and 8,000 more people who retired early. Dave Prentis, general secretary of the Unison union, said: ‘Small relief in the unemployment figures will be no comfort to those struggling with the misery of long-term unemployment. ‘Every job lost is a personal tragedy and the Government has to do more to tackle the persistent jobs crisis.’ Positive: The total number of people claiming Jobseekers Allowance fell to 1.478million, the lowest level since March 2011 and lower than at the election in May 2010. Wage rises are failing to keep pace with increasing living costs, making it harder for workers to make ends meet . TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady added: ‘While today's figures show some welcome small improvements our labour market remains a long way off from a strong recovery. ‘Long-term unemployment is at a 17-year high and youth unemployment remains at crisis levels. ‘Those in work are continuing to see the value of their wages pushed down by inflation, as the biggest squeeze in living standards for over a century continues.’ Prime Minister David Cameron said the latest employment figures were 'encouraging' The Office for National Statistics also reported that 29.7 million people were in employment in the three months to May, up 16,000 on the previous quarter, and an increase of 336,000 on a year ago. Unemployment is 72,000 lower than a year ago, with a jobless rate of 7.8 per cent. Youth unemployment fell by 20,000 to 959,000, giving a jobless rate for 16 to 24-year-olds of 20.9 per cent. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons today, David Cameron said: 'The unemployment figures today are welcome. 'They see a very large fall in the claimant count today - 20,000 in the last month and encouraging signs in terms of employment growth. 'Some of that is because of the extra resources that we put in to apprenticeships - over one million people starting apprenticeships in this Parliament which we can be proud of. 'I hope that the fall in unemployment will be welcomed across the House.' Average earnings increased by 1.7 per cent in the year to May, up by 0.2 per cent on the previous month, giving an average weekly wage of £476. However the squeeze on incomes continues, after inflation figures this week showed the cost of living was up 2.9 per cent last month. Employment Minister Mark Hoban said: ‘Our welfare reform agenda is about making a fair and affordable system that incentivises work: giving people the support they need to get off benefits and into a job. ‘Today's figures are encouraging, with the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance down and the number of people in work increasing. ‘The fall in the number of people claiming out-of-work benefits, together with the news that there are currently over half a million vacancies available in the UK economy, show that there are opportunities out there for those who are prepared to work hard, and who aspire to get on in life.’","915,000 people have not had a job for at least 12 months, a 17-year high .

"An 'exasperated' Barack Obama offered no guarantees the U.S. would avoid an unprecedented default during a crisis meeting with Wall Street bankers yesterday. The President said it could not be taken for granted that the political infighting over the federal shutdown would ease in time to raise the legal debt limit before the October 17 deadline. Speaking on CNBC last night, he said: 'I think this time is different. I think they should be concerned. 'When you have a situation in which a faction is willing to default on U.S. obligations, then we are in trouble.' Scroll down for video . No reassurances: Barack Obama warned world bankers that they should not take for granted that lawmakers will agree to raise the debt ceiling in time to avoid a default .

'Don't use debt crisis as a cudgel': Blankfein (centre) implicitly criticised Republicans for using their opposition to the healthcare law as a weapon that could lead to a U.S. default . Chief executives from major financial . institutions met Obama over the first budget impasse for 17 years in a . row over healthcare and finances. They . warned of ‘adverse’ consequences if the U.S. government agencies remain . closed and if lawmakers failed to raise the debt ceiling by . mid-October. After the meeting, Goldman Sachs . chief executive Lloyd Blankfein implicitly criticised Republicans for . using their opposition to Obama's healthcare law as a weapon that could . lead to a devastating default. ‘You . can litigate these policy issues.

Congressional Republicans and the White House are in a stalemate over government funding – chiefly as a tactic in the Republican campaign to stop Obama’s health insurance reforms. Sign of the times: A message outside the Lincoln Memorial which has closed due to the government shutdown. Economists are more concerned about a possible U.S. default later this month . Blockade: A barrier blocks the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial in Washington as national parks were closed due the budget battle . The President stressed to congressional leaders last night that he will not negotiate with Republicans over a government shutdown or raising the U.S. debt limit, the White House said. After more than an hour of talks at the White House that did not lead to a breakthrough, the White House issued a statement saying that Obama remains hopeful that 'common sense will prevail' in the budget stand-off. 'The president made clear to the leaders that he is not going to negotiate over the need for Congress to act to reopen the government or to raise the debt limit to pay the bills Congress has already incurred,' the White House said. House Republicans have been demanding that Obama agree to cut funding or delay implementation of his signature healthcare law in exchange for their agreement to approve spending measures to reopen the government. Obama held talks in the Oval Office with the top U.S. Republican, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, the Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, the top Democrat in Congress, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. It was their first face-to-face talks since a government shutdown began on Tuesday. While . the U.S. government closure has already had repercussions from . frustrated tourists turned away from national parks to cancelled stops . on Obama’s Asia  trip, the deadline for raising the nation’s debt limit . poses a much graver risk. If . the U.S. Congress fails to raise the $16.7trillion (€12.3trillion) borrowing cap, the U.S. would go  into default, likely triggering . financial market shockwaves around the world. March: Furloughed federal employes march in front of a shuttered Independence Hall at Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia . ‘There’s . no debate that the seriousness of the U.S. not paying its debts... is . the most serious thing we have, and we witnessed that in August 2011 and . you saw the ramifications: a slowdown in the economy,’ said Brian . Moynihan, chief executive of Bank of America. The . country came close to default during a similar political crisis in . 2011. That stand-off prompted  the first downgrade of the U.S. credit . rating. Conservative . Republicans have signalled they will take the same tactic on the debt . limit this year as they did on government funding by seeking to . dismantle or put off the healthcare law. President Obama has declined to . negotiate over raising the debt limit. Business leaders made clear the financial world wanted to avoid the risk of the government not paying its bills. ‘There . is precedent for a government shutdown. There’s no precedent for . default. We’re the most important economy in the world. We’re the . reserve currency of the world,’ said Mr Blankfein. 'Business . leaders want Washington to understand ‘the long-term consequences of a . shutdown ... certainly the  consequences of a debt ceiling  [not being . raised], and we all agree that those are extremely adverse,’ he said. Michael Corbat of Citigroup and others were scheduled to attend the session. ‘I . think both sides have a pretty good appreciation for what’s at stake . here,’ said Mr Corbat. He said the executives were ‘trying to encourage . both sides to engage.’ Obama . is scheduled to meet the top leaders of Congress at the White House. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew is to brief the leaders on the impacts of . the threat of default in 2011 and the economic imperative for Congress . to act to raise the debt ceiling.","'Exasperated' president says shutdown feud may prevent debt solution .

"The European Union last night demanded a £3.5 billion bailout from national governments, amid warnings it will run out of cash within months. In a blunt admission the EU Budget Commissioner Janusz Lewandowski said: ‘We need additional funds to meet our legal obligations.’ Britain’s share will be about £450 million. European Union Budget Commissioner Janusz Lewandowski said $3.5 billion is needed to keep governments afloat - including a £450 million pay out from Britain . The demand comes just six months after the EU was granted an extra £6.4 billion to keep it afloat. The extra cash will take the total EU budget to £126 billion - an 8.4 per cent increase on the previous year. Tory MPs last night urged David Cameron to refuse to pay up. Former Tory Cabinet minister John Redwood said Brussels should cut its spending rather than expect cash-strapped national governments to bail it out again. He said the demand for more money made a mockery of claims that EU leaders had agreed a ‘tough’ budget deal. ‘It is outrageous that they dare to do . this,’ he said. ‘They are very fond of ordering member states like . Greece to make cuts - let them now make the cuts they should have made . themselves. Prime Minister David Cameron has been urged by members of the Tory party to refuse to pay up the huge amount suggested by the European Union . ‘We should just say no and refuse to pay. We have far more important things to spend the money on.’ Fellow Tory Douglas Carswell also urged the Prime Minister to take a stand - and warned that Parliament might vote down any attempt to send extra cash. Mr Carswell said: ‘David Cameron needs to tell them to get stuffed. If he fails to do that then he has a problem. Parliament voted for an EU budget cut and the Prime Minister should not assume that MPs will just nod through an increase now. ‘We simply cannot afford to give Europe millions more when public services have been cut back at home. There are schools and hospitals in my constituency that would love to have this money. ‘It would also send out completely the wrong signal - if we are serious about taking on Ukip then this cannot be allowed to happen.’ Mr Lewandowski said the EU had no choice but to ask for extra cash, as more infrastructure projects had been completed than expected. He said it was clear earlier in the year . that the EU would need around £10 billion extra, but member states had . only been willing to pay £6.4 billion at the time. Against: Former Conservative MP John Redwood and current party member Douglas Carswell insist the government should take a stand against the EU's demands . ‘Time and again in the past few years I have warned that the voted EU budgets are well below the legitimate claims of EU beneficiaries,’ he said. ‘We see the result today. Estimates of upcoming claims validated by member states . themselves clearly show that we need additional funds to meet our legal obligations towards beneficiaries of EU funds.’ Mr Lewandowski said failure to agree the extra £3.5 billion this year would jeopardise a deal to cut the EU’s long-term budget. He said: ‘We owe it to the crisis-stricken Europe and hundreds of thousands of EU beneficiaries to finally adopt and implement the (long-term budget) as it constitutes an essential source of investment in EU countries. I trust that both member states and the European Parliament will swiftly adopt it.’ But Tory MEP Marta Andreasen said infrastructure projects and other so-called ‘cohesion policy’ had been singled out by auditors as being an easy target for fraud. Miss Andreasen, once the European Commission’s chief accountant, said: ‘The EU institutions throw taxpayers’ cash around like confetti. Meanwhile, official figures yesterday underlined the status of English as the EU’s lingua franca. A study by the EU’s statistics body Eurostat found that 94 per cent of secondary school children across Europe now learn English. The second most popular language is French, which is studied by just 23 per cent of European pupils.","Budget Commissioner Janusz Lewandowski insists huge amount is needed to keep Europe afloat .

"A British woman could be jailed for up to ten years over claims that she was a key figure in a Mafia drug-smuggling operation run from a Spanish holiday resort. Sheryl Rogers, 46, was the mistress of a Mafia boss who ran the £100million business for one of Italy’s most dangerous criminal families. The grandmother of three spent years as the lover of Giuseppe Felaco, a senior member of the Nuvoletta family. Scroll down for video . Horse-loving Sheryl Rogers is accused of helping her former lover run a multi-million pound crime organisation . Rogers, from Box Hill, Surrey, is accused of helping to launder hundreds of millions of pounds in profits from the smuggling of up to six tons of cannabis from Morocco to Italy every month. The horse-lover was arrested three years ago in a raid at Felaco’s holiday complex in Tenerife. She spent five months in prison before being released on bail, and recently became engaged to Stephen Hill, a handyman from Middlesbrough who lives on the island. Felaco died at 57 from cancer shortly after he was arrested in 2011 as police seized assets worth £32million, including super-cars, luxury properties and a yacht. His lover of 16 years is due to go on trial in months with 20 other alleged members of the Nuvoletta family. In a writ at the Central Criminal Court in Madrid, prosecutors claim that Rogers ‘participated actively in financial operations’ to conceal criminal money. But she claims Felaco, with whom she has a 16-year-old son, told her that he was a legitimate businessman. He said he bought the 200-apartment Marina Palace resort in Adeje in Tenerife for £3.2million in 1999 with a bank loan. But police claim he built the complex in the Nineties and installed henchmen to launder drugs profits. The 46-year-old will stand trial in Spain in months alongside 20 members of her former lover's family. She is pictured with her British fiancee Stephen  Hill . At the weekend, Rogers, who met Felaco while running a bar in Tenerife, described the charges as ‘daft’ and said police had got ‘everything completely wrong’. She said she could not have been in the Mafia because she was not Italian and, besides, they did not admit female members. ‘I was basically a housewife,’ she said. ‘I did not have anything to do with the business. I was put down in the books as if I worked in his business but that was because we weren’t married and I had no social [security] and he wouldn’t let me work. 'I still cannot believe the Mafia accusation, but then perhaps I did not know him at all, and that is very scary. ‘I still do not know if he actually loved me or just used me. Now he is dead I will never know.’ Rogers moved to Tenerife in 1994 to open a bar, and fell for the crime boss. She gave birth to his son, Joseph Felaco, in October 1997. Felaco – known as Peppe Nazzaro – was originally a member of another Neapolitan Mafia family when he married Maria Michelino, from the Nuvoletta clan. Rogers claimed that Felaco’s wife knew all about her and that their children even became friends. Rogers recently became engaged to Hill (pictured together) who works on the island as a handyman . The Nuvoletta family control a network of international business interests, from cement manufacturing to hotel cleaning. Felaco built up an extraordinary empire, including an Italian holiday home on Lake Como near George Clooney’s mansion. Rogers and her co-defendants face a ten-year prison sentence and fines of up to £2.4million each over charges of money laundering and illicit association. She said that after her arrest she was held as a high-risk prisoner and could have no visitors, so she only learned of her lover’s death from another inmate. Rogers accused police of rushing the inquiry. She said: ‘They hadn’t finished their investigation when they arrested all the people. The main man, Giuseppe, was dying, so they made a mass of arrests. A lot of people in this case have absolutely nothing to do with anything.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Sheryl Rogers was mistress of boss of one of Italy's most dangerous families .

"William Hague last night warned that the horrific chemical weapons attack in Syria was ‘not something that a humane and civilised world can ignore’. The Foreign Secretary refused to rule out any response to Wednesday’s atrocity in Damascus. And he laid the blame for the attack – which is reported to have killed up to 1,700 people – squarely at the door of tyrant Bashar al-Assad. William Hague said the atrocity in Damascus was 'not something that a humane and civilised world can ignore' A mother and father weep over their child's body who was killed in a suspected chemical weapons attack on the Damascus suburb of Ghouta . Mr Hague said the possibility that rebel fighters could have unleashed the chemicals, as claimed by the Assad regime and its Russian allies, was ‘vanishingly small’. He said: ‘I know some people in the world would like to say this is some kind of conspiracy brought about by the opposition in Syria – I think the chances of that are vanishingly small. So we do believe this is a chemical attack by the Assad regime on a large scale.’ Mr Hague, who discussed the crisis with US Secretary of State John Kerry and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, called for UN chemical weapons inspectors to be allowed immediate access to the site of the attack before any evidence deteriorates. Mr Ban added that inspectors, who are based a 20-minute drive away, should be allowed in ‘without delay’. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond . suggested the atrocity could harden Britain’s response to the civil war . in Syria, saying: ‘If, as the evidence suggests, chemical weapons have . been used on a significant scale against a civilian population, those . who are responsible should be in no doubt they will be held to account . by the international community.’ Dead animals litter the street in the region where forces loyal to Bresident Bashar Al-Assad allegedly used chemical weapons . A man holds the body of a dead child among bodies of people activists say were killed by nerve gas in the Ghouta region, in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus, many of them were women and children . It comes as American media report that the U.S. military is preparing for a long-range missile attack on Syrian government targets. Escalation towards a military strike could mean that President Barack Obama intends to make good on his threat of 'enormous consequences' if Assad crossed the 'red line' of using chemical weapons against his own people. Possible targets include command bunkers and missile sites that could be used to launch chemical-tipped missiles. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey is expect to present the plan for a missile strike to Obama at a national security meeting on Saturday. CBS News reports that 'The Pentagon is making initial preparations for a missile attack on Syrian government forces.' Commanders of the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean ordered warships to move closer to Israel, so they would be in better striking range to hit forces in Syria. There are four main options facing Hague and his allies, none of which offer an easy way out . The maximum range for Tomahawk Cruise Missiles is about 1,500 miles. However any missile strike is likely to be more tactical than strategic - they are unlikely to topple, or even significantly destabilize Assad's regime and so American leaders will be hoping that instead it sends a strong message to the regime that chemical weapons will not be tolerated. David Cameron is expected to carry out a round of telephone diplomacy from his Cornish holiday retreat over the weekend and convene the National Security Council next week to discuss Britain’s options for a response. In recent weeks the Prime Minister has backed away from the idea of arming Syria’s rebels because of concerns within his own party that the weapons could fall into the hands of extremists. But a Downing Street source said Britain would ‘look again’ at its options in the wake of the latest outrage. Yesterday the UN revealed the number of children fleeing the conflict had passed one million. The UN’s refugee agency and Unicef described the figure as a ‘shameful milestone’ and warned two million more children are displaced within Syria.","Foreign Secretary branded the possibility that the rebel fighters could have unleashed the chemicals themselves as 'vanishingly small'

"Where do you see yourself in five years time? It's a common interview question designed to learn about a person's ambitions, and thanks to new technology you could soon be able to give a precise answer to this question. Researchers from Microsoft and Google can predict where a person will be years from now using a new computer software called Far Out.The programme tracks a person using a GPS device and learns their routine. It then uses this information to accurately guess their future locations and will adapts its predictions even if someone changes their job, relationship or moves house. A screenshot from the Far Out mapping software. Researchers from Microsoft and Google can predict where a person will be years from now using this system. The program tracks a person using GPS and learns their routine. It then uses this information to accurately plot their future locations . Using GPS systems carried by volunteers and fitted to the transport they used on a daily basis, the researchers were able to plot around 150 million location points. Furthermore, over 32,000 days worth of precise GPS data was collected. This information was fed into the Far Out software which uses an algorithm to predict where a person will be in the future, based on where they've been in the past. It does this by accurately 'learning' a person's routine. Far Out then offers predictions but can also automatically discover when someone veers from this routine. The program will plot these changes, learn from them, and adapt accordingly. Researchers believe the results could be used to predict rises in populations, the spread of disease, . traffic and broadband demand to quote a number of the researchers . examples. Adam Sadilek and . John Krumm wanted to learn more about what they call 'human mobility' so set about developing a formula that could predict where a person would be years in the future in their paper 'Far Out: Predicting Long-Term Human . Mobility.' They gave 703 . volunteers in Seattle a GPS device and told them to carry it around with them at all times, including going to work, shopping, out with friends and even travelling. The researchers also fitted GPS units to the buses, cars and other transport used by the volunteers on a daily basis. Sadilek and Krumm managed to collect around 150 million location points and 32,000 days worth of GPS data during this experiment. This data was fed into their Far Out computer program to predict the 'long-term human mobilty' of each subject. Far Out was able to offer predictions, and could also automatically discover when someone veered from their usual routine, adapting accordingly. 'For . example, [Far Out] might notice that Tuesdays and Thursdays are usually about . the same and fairly consistent from week to week,' the researchers told Fast Company. 'Then when we ask about a future Tuesday or Thursday, the algorithm . automatically produces a typical Tuesday/Thursday as a prediction.' 'If there is a sharp transition, such . as a move to another city, the system notices there is a discrepancy . between its predictions and actual data and adapts to the new patterns. 'Most people have only a few ‘revolutionary’ changes in the course of their lives, so Far Out isn't caught off guard . too often.' According to Salidek and Krumm's paper, humans are mostly predictable even over extended periods of time. The researchers gave volunteers in Seattle a GPS device and told them to carry it around with them at all times. The researchers also fitted GPS units to the transport used daily by the volunteers. Sadilek and Krumm managed to collect around 150 million location points and 32,000 days worth of GPS data . The GPS data was fed into the Far Out system so the program could learn a person's routine. Far Out then predicted where that person would be, including their longitudinal and latitudinal positions, on a certain date in the future. The software even takes into account if there is a national holiday on that date . The paper said: 'Much work has been done on predicting where is one going to be in the immediate future, typically within the next hour. By contrast, we address the open problem of predicting human mobility far into the future, a scale of months and years.' Far Out uses 'a nonparametric method that extracts significant and robust patterns in location data, learns their associations with contextual features (such as day of week), and subsequently leverages this information to predict the most likely location at any given time in the future.' The researchers believe the software could have social uses, similar to Foursquare, or could be used by advertisers and marketers. They also believe the results 'open a number of interesting avenues for future research and applications.' This could include predicting rises in populations, the spread of disease, traffic problems and broadband demand.","Program called Far Out tracks people using GPS to learn their routine .

"Evidence of cocaine use has been found inside toilets at the Houses of Parliament, including some just yards from MPs' offices. Traces of the class A drug were found in nine toilets throughout the Palace Of Westminster, the meeting place of the UK's political elite. The powder was detected in toilets used by guests at Parliament's bars, as well as cubicles a few yards away from MPs' offices - areas where members of the public are restricted from going. Not to be sniffed at: Evidence of cocaine use has been uncovered at the Houses of Parliament . Charlie: Possession of cocaine can get you up to seven years in jail. File picture . The drug use was uncovered using cocaine indicator swabs, which come up with blue blotches when rubbed on surfaces where the drug has been laid out in lines, such as toilet seats and hairdryers. The swabs are used by the police and customs officers. As Parliament’s toilets are cleaned regularly, the white powder must have been snorted in the past few hours, according to reporters from The Sun, who did the testing. Users would have to smuggle the drug past extensive security checks and 500 police officers and guards. The reporters, acting on a tip-off from a House of Commons insider, claim to have found evidence of the drug in the cubicles of the toilets outside Strangers’ Bar and in private areas close to MPs' offices. High office: The cocaine use was uncovered using test kits, similar to the one pictured . Tory MP Douglas Carswell was scathing about the find. He said: 'With decadence comes something rotten. It suggests there is something rotten about the institution itself.' On two occasions cannabis has been confiscated at Westminster's entry checkpoints since the start of 2008, according to a Freedom of Information request. A Parliamentary spokesman said: 'Parliament is a public place and we welcome over a million visitors a year who have either direct access to these facilities or access when accompanied. 'Clearly, it is inappropriate to monitor what happens in toilet facilities. In addition, we have issued over 14,000 passes, held by contractors and other third parties, as well as staff of both Houses, Members and their staff. 'Consequently, it is impossible to know who may be involved. Our security searches are focussed on preventing harm to others and the building, not the detection of small amounts of drugs. 'Parliament takes the issue of substance misuse very seriously and offers a range of welfare and health support services for those who need them.' A few days ago a Parliamentary watchdog said MPs should have an 11 per cent pay rise to £74,000 a year. In 2005 a German television station found traces of cocaine in 41 of 46 lavatories tested at the European Parliament in Brussels.","Evidence of class A drug use detected in UK's seat of power .

"An American has invented a new condom which he says is stronger, safer and enables better sensitivity. The Galatic Cap Pregnancy Prevention device sits on the very tip of the penis, leaving the shaft exposed. It was developed by LA-based Charles Powell after a friend of his contracted HIV. The Galatic Cap Pregnancy Prevention sits on the very tip of the penis, leaving the shaft exposed. The condom comprises two parts - a U-shape polyurethane adhesive film (right) that wraps around the penis - and a cap that sticks to it to firmly trap semen (left) He believes his product is 'easier to use, safer and more secure - and vastly more pleasurable - giving a sex sensation the way nature intended.' The condom comprises two parts - a U-shape  polyurethane adhesive film that wraps around the penis - like a plaster around a finger - and a cap that sticks to it to firmly trap semen. Mr Powell claims the polyurethane part is like a second skin - and can be put on hours or days in advance as it can be worn while urinating and washing. When a man wants to have sex, he peels off the paper backing on the cap and sticks it to the polyurethane to securely bond the two and trap semen. He insists the device, which is transparent, will stay on for the duration. Mr Powell believes his product provides a solution to three common issues with condoms: a lack of sensitivity, problems getting into the packaging and applying the condom. He also maintains that traditional products have a failure rate of up to 18 per cent due tto breakage or improper usage. 'The reservoir cap is thicker and stronger than a traditional condom and is less likely to break or fail.' But critics have pointed out that the . device will not provide protection from STIs such as herpes, which can . be transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact.

Developer Charles Powell believes the device addresses three common issues with condoms: a lack of sensitivity, problems getting into the packaging and applying the condom, and breakage . Jason Warriner, clinical director of the sexual health charity Terence Higgins Trust, told MailOnline: 'This will not prevent the spread of conditions such as HIV or herpes as the whole penis is not covered. 'It may be suitable for a couple in a long-term relationship but not as a barrier to STIs. 'There is also the risk that the cap may leak, exposing semen.' As of June 1, the company will be crowdfunding to raise funds for development and FDA approval. Some have even hailed as it as condom solution for the porn industry as it leaves much of the shaft uncovered. It's estimated that in 2012, 18.5 billion condoms were sold worldwide. This is expected to increase to 27 billion units by next year, with the market worth $6bn.

"There was a time when a hen do consisted of a good old knees up down the local pub, maybe withe a few naughty, novelty straws thrown in and an L plate to be worn by the bride-to-be. But now the average cost of attending a hen do has spiralled to hundreds of pounds per guest and fancy parties can involve anything from  a mini stay-cation or even a full-blown holiday, leaving attendees seriously out of pocket. The average cost of attending a hen do abroad is almost £700 and for those held at home in Britain just short of £200 per person - yet going to the big day itself can cost them a fraction of the price, says a new survey. Increasingly fancy bachelorette parties can involve a mini staycation or even a full-blown holiday . Respondents cite the rising cost of bachelorette parties  is down to many factors, starting with the need to plash out on a wardrobe update - even if it is just to keep up with appearances. And looking your best to bid farewell to the bride's single-life can involve more money than ever with sprucing up for the occasion including hair and beauty sessions, while food and drink and transport, all bump up the price to an average of £185 when staying in the UK. Furthermore, an increasing trend to hold parties abroad can involve a whole new holiday wardrobe complete with bikinis and going-out clothes plus the flights and hotels, sees the average costs rise to £680. In contrast the average cost of attending a wedding is estimated to be around £360, including everything from a night's accommodation, one new outfit, a wedding present, drinks and transport, according to the survey of 1,100 shoppers. For hen dos abroad, a holiday wardrobe, flights and hotels, sees the average costs rise to £680 . The stag and hen party industry is worth an estimated £300million a year and growing - with many young professionals treating the events as a mini-holiday that lasts several days rather than just one night. Over four out of ten (43 per cent) potential brides questioned in the survey said they gave friends at least three months warning of a hen party so they could plan ahead and a quarter (24 per cent) provided more than six months notice of the celebrations. Two thirds of all women invited to a pre-nuptual knees up said they would start saving well in advance in order to afford the occasion and look to buy suitable outfits often taking advantage of sale. More than three quarters (78 per cent) said they would buy something new to wear. Travel/fuel/train/bus/taxi/limo             £20 . Cost of organised activity or spa day      £40 .

A personal stylist at Debenhams, who commissioned the research said: 'We have seen a steady increase in enquiries from customers wanting help purchasing new outfits for hen parties, weekends and trips abroad. 'Often the group of invited women may not all have seen each other for a few years and it is natural that they want to look their best. 'Planning and shopping ahead is the key to getting the most for your money.' For those in the UK, beauty prep, food and drink and transport, all bump up the price to an average of £185 . The term 'hen party' dates back to the 1800s and signified a gathering of women, but there was no link with weddings. Writer George Monger wrote about the pre-wedding customs prevalent in industry in 1971, with some obvious parallels to the hen party culture we see today. On a female employees last day of work before the wedding she would be dressed up in a coat or veil to look like a parody of a bride, then paraded around the factory to be congratulated. However, it was not until 1976 that the Times newspaper first used the phrase 'hen party' in the modern-day sense. It was in a news report about a male stripper who was fined by Leicester Crown Court for acting in 'a lewd, obscene and disgusting manner'.","A hen do abroad can cost guests almost £700 per person .
For those held at home in Britain will set them back just short of £200 .
Women are spending more than ever on travel, treatments and clothes .
The average cost of attending a wedding is estimated at £360 ."
"My usual look: Swept off the face . Most women know that the right haircut and colour can take years off your appearance, but few spend time worrying about how their parting is ageing their face, writes Frances Childs. However, according to celebrity hair-stylist Andrew Barton, the wrong parting can make us look years older - dragging down features - while the right parting can be almost as rejuvenating as a visit to a plastic surgeon. I'm so unsure what to do with my own parting that I usually sweep my hair back in a slightly skew-whiff messy look. Yet at 45, I'm eager to turn back the clock. Here, with the help of Pascal Lombardo, chief stylist at Andrew Barton's London salon, I try five different partings to see if they make me look older or younger - with staggering results. Ageing: The centre parting looks too severe . HOW TO DO IT: It's easiest to get a clean parting on damp hair. Take the sharp end of a tail comb and, starting at your hairline, guide the point of the comb straight through the centre of your head, using the teeth to smooth down the sides as you go. Easy peasy. VERDICT: I hate this parting! I had hoped that this look would be chic and sleek, but sadly, I look old and severe - like a desiccated Miss Havisham. My hair has no body at the crown and hangs limply down the sides of my face. Although I only coloured my hair a month ago, the parting shows off my obvious re-growth and, let’s face it, grey hairs are anything but youthful. 'Unless you can afford to have your roots touched up every few weeks, it is best to avoid severe partings,' Pascal admits. 'This is a classic look. It's elegant, but on you it is a little ageing as it drags the face downwards.' Trendy: The zig-zag adds volume . HOW TO DO IT: This one is a little trickier. First, create your classic centre parting as before, then, with the tail of your comb, lift a section of hair from a centimetre to the left of your parting and flick it over to the right, smoothing with your comb. Do the same on the right side and then repeat every couple of centimetres until you reach the crown of your head. VERDICT: I'm wary of this one. It may be a zig-zag, but it's still a centre parting, which, I'm now convinced, makes me look ancient. But Pascal insists: 'The slightly messy look will soften your features, making you look younger. And a jagged parting will make hair look thicker. 'The zig-zag effect adds volume, which lifts the cheekbones, making the face look more youthful.' And it does! Not only does it seem to lift my face, but the trendier style makes me look less austere and grannyish. Result! Flattering: The parting makes the eyes look bigger . HOW TO DO IT: My right eye is noticeably bigger and wider than my left, so Pascal explains that parting my hair on the right should be flattering as it will bring attention to this eye. I'm getting to be a dab hand with the tail comb now, but I still have to reposition this line a couple of times until Pascal's satisfied I've got it exactly right. VERDICT: I love it! I think I look much younger and Pascal explains why. 'Having your hair sweeping from right to left emphasises your wider eye, and wider eyes give your face the appearance of youth,' he says. 'Parting your hair this way will always make you look younger.' My hair seems to have more volume and body as well, which combine to make me look more youthful. The added volume, especially around the cheekbones, makes my face look a bit fuller, too, and distracts from my sagging jawline. Hurrah! Sculpted: It's chic but not right for Frances . HOW TO DO IT: This time we use the thin outer edge of my eyebrow as a guide. Starting from that point we run the tail of the comb neatly from the front to the back of my head, smoothing the sides down as we go. 'Using the natural line of the eyebrow as a guide, you get a parting that helps to create a flattering look,'  he explains. VERDICT: I can see that the low parting looks sculpted and chic. But I suspect I don't have the flamboyance and dramatic flair necessary to carry this off. 'It looks fabulous, vibrant. You could wear it to a party,' enthuses Pascal as he showers me in hairspray. But I'm not convinced, it's for me. It looks like a comb-over gone wrong and it's much too trendy. My hair now dips down far too low on my forehead to be flattering, and, when I look in the mirror, my attention's drawn straight to the edge of my crow's feet. Not a good look. Favourite look: This kind of parting is also favoured by the Duchess of Cambridge . HOW TO DO IT:  Pascal explains that the way to find the perfect position for an off-centre parting is to trace a line up from the inner edge of my right eye and then part my hair directly in alignment with that point. I could get the hang of this one. VERDICT: This is my favourite parting and I'm in good company. The Duchess of Cambridge often has her hair parted in a similar fashion. The difference an inch makes is amazing. It's surprisingly flattering, softening my face and distracting from my wobbly jawline. 'As we age our faces begin to lose definition, but this parting draws attention to the eyes and the cheekbones and away from the sagging bits,' Pascal explains. The parting also gives my hair more body, which makes me look younger. My new parting has forced my hair to hang in a different way, and the swoop across my forehead breaks up my frown lines quite brilliantly.","Celeb hair-stylist Andrew Barton says the wrong parting can make us look years older .

"Capped off: Jobless families should only receive benefits for two children,Tory chairman Grant Shapps said . Child-related benefits for the jobless should be capped at two children, the Tory party chairman declared last night. The move would put them in the same position as working parents who cannot afford to have large families, Grant Shapps argued. Unemployed parents who then choose to have more than two children ‘will know that welfare is not going to fund that choice’. As the Government’s £26,000-a-year benefits cap for the out-of-work took effect yesterday, Mr Shapps insisted further radical reforms to welfare were back on the table. In another proposal, the minister said under-25s who are unemployed should be denied housing benefit, so they have to live with their parents rather than be funded by the taxpayer to move to a place of their own. He said this would end the current ‘bizarre incentive’ that makes it easier for jobless youngsters to move out, than for those who have to work and save in order to afford to do so. Mr Shapps insisted the plans could be implemented in this Parliament, despite Lib Dem opposition. Families living off benefits are currently unfairly freed from the decisions faced by millions of working people, he argued. More than 12,000 people have moved into work after being told about the new benefits cap, the Government said. The limit now means couples and lone  parents in England, Scotland and  Wales cannot receive more than £500 a week, while a £350 limit applies to single people. Mr Shapps said the Tories were now examining further reforms. By far the most controversial is that unemployed parents with two children could not be given any more support if they decide to have another child. Under the plan, child benefit, income support or tax credits could be withheld for the extra children. Two's the limit: The Conservative Party chairman suggested that those who are out of work should only receive benefits for two children to put a stop to 'Benefits Britain' Mr Shapps also said housing benefit . could be removed from 380,000 people under 25, meaning they must join . the growing number of young working adults whose financial circumstances . force them to continue to live with their parents into their late 20s . and 30s. The reform would save £1.8billion. It . is understood Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has . requested time to legislate for more changes in next year’s . Parliamentary session. Chancellor George Osborne could reduce the new £500-a-week cap on benefits if it proves effective in reducing the welfare bill and encouraging work. The controversial annual limit on total household income from a range of benefits was introduced yesterday at the level of the average salary of £26,000, amid claims that it will force many families into hardship. But Conservative MPs want it cut further to £20,000 as part of an assault on welfare spending if Tories win the 2015 general election. The move would open up a political dividing line with Liberal Democrat coalition partners, who have acted as a brake on Tory ambitions to slash back the welfare state. An aide confirmed that Mr Osborne had received representations on lowering the cap, adding: 'We want to see how the policy beds in. But clearly over time, lowering the cap is an option.' ‘Welfare should not be a way of life,’ Mr Shapps said. ‘A . lot of people worry that the way welfare operated under the last . government meant claimants were free from taking the difficult decisions . you would take if you are in work – none more starkly obvious than when . you have children. ‘If you are a working family and you have another child, you know it’s going to mean quite a severe impact on your living costs. Yet in the welfare system, it’s almost turned on its head, so additional children are actually recognised, with no limit. ‘We need to create a choice for people on welfare which mirrors that which millions of people in work who aren’t receiving state support have to make. It’s only fair to the taxpayer.’ Mr Shapps said the limit could not be applied retrospectively, adding: ‘You would have to say to families with two or more children who go on to have more after that date that they would not get further support. ‘It’s something I would like to see done, or at least considered, in this Parliament. 'It would send a strong signal to hard working people in this country that we are on their side.’ On housing benefit, he said: ‘A young person who’s out of work is given an advantage over a young person who’s in work when it comes to moving away from their parents because of housing benefit. Further changes: It is believed Iain Duncan Smith has requested time to legislate for more changes to the benefits system in next year¿s Parliamentary session . ‘So there’s a bizarre incentive which . means if you’re not in work you can more easily move out and get your . own place. This is a matter of basic fairness.’ He also attacked Labour’s ‘absolutely unbelievable’ position on welfare reform. ‘They voted against all our legislation . on benefit reform, then suggested they were in favour in some of it . after all, and now as it comes in they seem to be against it again,’ Mr . Shapps said. Labour’s welfare spokesman Liam Byrne insisted ministers ‘need to give us a cap that is different in London to the rest of the country because rents in London are that much higher’. But former Labour welfare minister Frank Field urged his party to accept the £26,000 cap immediately. He said Labour was ‘struggling to establish some general principles which taxpayers will support with their money’. ‘The key thing is whether in fact people should get more money, and sometimes considerably more money, than if they were actually working, and that’s the principle that the Government has actually introduced,’ Mr Field said. ‘Labour’s job, I think, is to accept this cap and move on quickly to a proactive policy.’ Meanwhile a report by the ‘40 Group’ of Tory MPs argued welfare payments for teenage mothers may encourage them to get pregnant so they can get their own flats. It suggests they should instead be supported by their parents or given supervised hostel accommodation. BBC Radio 4 presenter John Humphrys accused the minister  of having 'beliefs' which were not borne out by the facts . Iain Duncan Smith yesterday accused the BBC of using ‘politically motivated’ interviewees to criticise government welfare cuts. The Work and Pensions Secretary spoke out after Radio 4 news programme Today featured a female protester who was planted by an anti-cuts group. He clashed with presenter John Humphrys on air as the BBC covered the roll out of the £26,000-a-year cap on benefits. An interview with a mother-of-three called Rebecca claimed she would be nearly £100 a week worse off. Yesterday it was revealed she is a 36-year-old from North London, who arrived in Britain from the Congo in 1998. Yet there was no mention in the BBC report that the case study had been supplied by the pressure group Haringey Housing Action Group. Mr Duncan Smith levelled the charge of bias as he was quizzed by Mr Humphrys about his claim that 8,000 people had already come off benefits because of the cap, which was trialled in four London boroughs. Mr Humphrys said the UK Statistics Authority had found the claims to be ‘unsupported by the official statistics’. But Mr Duncan Smith hit back: ‘You can’t disprove what I said either. I believe this to be right. I believe that we are already seeing people go back to work who were not going to go back to work until they were short of the cap.’ He added: ‘What you’re doing, as always in the BBC, you’re seeking out lots of cases from people who are politically motivated to say this is wrong.’ The BBC last night insisted its political coverage is ‘fair, accurate and impartial’.","Child benefits for unemployed 'should be capped at two children'

"Critics say the handouts could result in families paying twice - once for the grants and again in higher energy bills . British families are unknowingly providing millions of pounds to green lobbyists who campaign for higher taxes on energy bills. Since 1997, £86 million has been handed to climate change and environmental groups by the EU, according to the Taxpayers’ Alliance. It claims Britain’s share of funding for organisations including Friends of the Earth, WWF, and Climate Action Network stands at £8.6 million during that period. The TPA says many of these taxpayer-funded lobbyists campaign for new regulations that could lead to higher household energy bills. The report found that 25 European-based groups have received in excess of 1m euros (£860,000) of public funds in a 15-year period. Matthew Sinclair, Director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said the handouts result in families paying twice - once for the grants and again in higher energy bills. ‘Many of the environmentalist groups funded with European Commission grants do not appear to be the sort to get their hands dirty looking after endangered plants and animals,’ he said. ‘Instead the bureaucrats in Brussels are spending our money to fund their own lobbyists, to create artificial pressure for ever more onerous regulations that hurt British business and add to families’ bills. ‘Taxpayer subsidies for radical environmentalists need to end. Politicians should be looking to put in place a more affordable energy policy rather than caving in to demands from their sock puppets for ever more onerous taxes and regulations.’ One group, the European Environmental Bureau, has received £10 million in public funding, the TPA claim. During this time, they have attacked the development of shale gas - which has the potential to reduce power bills - and pushed for tougher climate targets that could see energy charges increase. Yesterday, the TPA launched a campaign to persuade ministers to ‘stop the energy swindle’ as households struggle with record charges. By the end of the decade punitive green taxes will help inflate the average family energy bill by 29 per cent to £1,900, a study by the organisation found. It concluded that green charges and VAT will make up one third of energy bills - a staggering £620 per household. In today’s report, the TPA said that ‘taxpayer funded lobbying and political campaigning does not represent any independent economic or popular interest’. Tory MP Dominic Raab said the practice was hurting low and middle income households and inists it won't make our environment cleaner . It found examples of groups campaigning for policy goals, such as regulations to reduce greenhouse gases, that would result in an increased tax burden on already struggling families. Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘The green gravy train is the next big lobbying scandal. British taxpayers are coughing up millions to Brussels, which funds environmental groups to lobby national governments for pet regulation including subsidies that help keep our energy bills so high. ‘It is ludicrous boondoggle that won’t make our environment cleaner, and hurts low and middle income households.’ Ruth Porter, Communications Director at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ‘It’s outrageous that the EU funds any political lobbying at all. But what is so offensive about this example is that it is lobbying for policy that will push up energy prices at a time when many families in the UK are struggling with rising living costs. The TaxPayers' Alliance say by the end of the decade green taxes will help inflate the average family energy bill by 29 per cent to £1,900 . The UK government must do more to ensure that British taxpayers aren’t funding organisations to campaign for policies that they don’t support and that aren’t in their best interests.’ A spokesman for Friends of the Earth saidL: ‘We rely on the support of individuals and charitable trusts for over 95 per cent of our income and receives less than one per cent from the EU. ‘Friends of the Earth Europe also receives EU funding for its important campaigns that help to protect people and wildlife. ‘Our campaigning work focuses on safeguarding the long-term future of our environment – failure to do so will have a devastating impact on people and the economy.’","Britain has given £8.6million to environmental groups since 1997 .

"Melanie Hemmings opted for IVF treatment to have a child when she couldn't find a suitable father . Midwife Melanie Hemmings always dreamed of having a baby of her own. As a young woman she was sure she would find 'the one' before she was ready to become a mother. But life had other plans and following an eight year marriage, a divorce, and several years of dating she found herself alone, childless and very broody at 34. While investigating her options she discovered that she had some major fertility issues and that time was running out. Today, after undergoing three rounds of IVF, Melanie is a single mother to six-month-old Jasmin, and she couldn't be more delighted. Interviewed on This Morning today Melanie told hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield: 'I remember from the age of 24 thinking: ""This is it, I am ready as a woman,"" 'I was married for eight years but I knew he wasn't the right one to have children with and always assumed that I would meet somebody else after we got divorced.' 'At the age of 34 I decided to start looking into donor insemination. I wasn't interested in IVF, and didn't think I would need it. 'I didn't know then that there was a problem with my fertility and still thought that I might meet somebody, I was only 34.' Unfortunately Melanie didn't meet anybody and with her biological clock ticking she decided to have a private fertility test to take stock of her options. She was diagnosed with a Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) problem and doctors at the clinic confirmed that time was running out. Melanie said: 'I remember hearing the words ""You haven't got a day to waste."" 'My blood ran cold and I realised that this might not happen.' Melanie found an American sperm donor and discovered that she was pregnant on Christmas Eve 2012 following three rounds of IVF. Her daughter Jasmin was born in September 2013. TV host Holly, pregnant with her third child and clearly besotted with baby Jasmin during the interview, said: 'I would have done exactly the same thing.' Dr Geeta Nargund, a Harley Street . fertility specialist appearing on the show with Melanie added: 'Most . women want to have a natural baby. Plan B, for a younger woman, can be . to freeze their eggs. 'But when the clock is ticking faster and it is 'now or never' more women are considering donor sperm. 'There has been a change in society and women today want to have choices'. Melanie says: 'You have to be in the right . frame of mind. If you think you can do it, which I did, then go for it. You won't regret it, and you don't . want to go through life thinking ""what if?""' Melanie Hemmings appeared on This Morning with Harley Street fertility expert Dr Geeta Nargund . 'The 2004 guideline recommends that couples in which the woman is aged 23-39 years at the time of treatment and who have an identified cause for their fertility problems or who have infertility of at least three years' duration should be offered up to three stimulated cycles of IVF treatment. The new guidance [May 2012] recommends that in women aged 40 to 42 years who have not had IVF treatment, consider one full cycle of IVF, with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection, where there is no chance of pregnancy with expectant management ('absolute infertility') and where IVF is the only effective treatment. NICE also recommends that unstimulated intrauterine insemination should be considered as a treatment option for people who are unable to, or would find it very difficult to have vaginal intercourse because of a physical disability or psychosexual diagnosis who are using partner or donor sperm, people with conditions that require specific consideration in relation to methods of conception, and people who are in same-sex relationships. HIV treatments have improved significantly since the original guideline was published, and the updated draft guideline recommends that the transmission of HIV to the female partner is negligible through unprotected sexual intercourse when certain criteria are met.' - www.nice.org.uk .","Single women now make up 2.3% of those having IVF treatment .

"Khadijah Muhammad turned up to work at Cheddar's cafe-restaurant in Knoxville, Tennessee on Wednesday knowing that she needed a miracle. As she left her house there was a disconnection notice on the door that her electricity was about to be shut off - one of many bills that amounted this month after the 26-year-old wife was forced to give up her shifts and rush to Ohio to be with her mom, who had suffered a heart attack. 'All I wanted was to see my mother one more time,' a teary Muhammad told WBIR. 'With God's help, I managed to make it up there driving in the middle of the big snow storm that hit earlier this month.

But when she returned home, her financial woes awaited. 'It started to sink in how much work I missed and that I was not going to be able to pay all of my bills,' she said. 'I've been trying to pick up any extra shifts that I can. 'I was thinking I'm really going to need a miracle to pay my bills this month.' Her shift started normally and, being mid-week, business was fairly slow. Among the customers were a husband and a wife and their small child. 'They really did not stand out,' Muhammad recalled. 'They were just nice folks. I remember talking to them and having a friendly conversation like you would with a neighbor. Act of pure kindness: The check and the note the family left . 'The father ordered a country steak. The mother and son split a fish taco. They split it. 'They were really humble people.' The bill was $29.30 after tax, but the receipt was turned upside down when Muhammad went to clear the table, which is usually a bad sign. 'Normally, as a server, when a receipt is turned upside down it means you did not get a good tip or any tip,' she said. 'Or people will leave a nasty note about how you messed something up with their service. I remember thinking, ''I wonder what I did wrong''. However the receipt turned Muhammad's life upside down. 'I just remember seeing a comma after the one and knew it wasn't $10. And I was like, ''Oh, my God!'' And I just lost my balance and I was like, 'Does this say a thousand dollars?'

The tip was for $1,075 - representing a tithe the family would have normally given to their church. While the couple wish to stay anonymous, they told WBIR they had recently moved to Knoxville from Ohio and had not decided where to send their tithe money. They had recently received a work bonus and, after being impressed with Muhammad's service, decided their donation this month should go to her. The note they left Muhammad partially explained the decision, saying: 'Jesus Blessed us and we were led to give it to you. God Bless!' What makes the story all the more surprising is that the family were completely unaware of Muhammad's circumstances and just how much they have helped her. 'I just want to thank them,' she said. 'Thank them so much, because I'm humbled. I'm grateful. I do believe that God led you to me at this time in my life . 'I hope and pray that someday I'm able to do this for somebody.

"A mother whose daughter disappeared with her husband and young child in the Oklahoma mountains four years ago believes that the family of three was murdered by members of a violent cult.

'There's just no way that Bobby and Sherilyn would ever let anything happen to Madyson unless something had been done to them.' The . family went missing in while they were looking to buy property in the . remote Sans Bois Mountains near Kinta, Oklahoma - about 155 miles east . of Oklahoma City. 'That . part of Oklahoma is known for that - cults and stuff like that - from . what I've been told and from what I've read,' Ms Kokotan said. She did not say which cult she believed responsible for the deaths. Authorities say the skeletons found on Saturday appear to be two adults and a child. They were discovered just three miles from where police found the Jamison family's abandoned pickup truck in 2009. Forensic . scientists are currently trying to confirm a positive the . identification of the skeletons through dental records and DNA matched . with family members. Mystery: This is the Jamisons' pickup truck, which was found abandoned in the mountains eight days after the family was last seen . There . is only one survivor from the family's 2009 disappearance - the . family's dog Maizy. She was found barely alive in the family's pickup . truck - having survived by eating her own feces. 'Maizy survived. She lives with Bobby's mom now. Madyson loved that dog so much,' Ms Kokotan revealed. Ms Kokotan dismissed claims from the sheriff at the time that Bobby and Sherilyn were on drugs. She . said her daughter's strange behavior can be explained by the fact that . her sister, Ms Kokotan's daughter Marla, had died in a freak accident . two years earlier. She also said that she didn't believe the family was involved in witchcraft. Remote: The skeletons were found in a remote area of the mountains in rural Oklahoma, about 155 miles east of Oklahoma City . Missing: Authorities at the time were especially fearful for little Madyson's safety - prompting a massive search effort with hundreds of volunteers. The family was never found . They lived in Eufaula, but had been looking to buy property 35 miles away in the mountains. At their home, investigators found a shipping container that had bizarre messages scrawled across it, including '3 cats killed to date buy people in this area … Witches don’t like there black cat killed' (sic). Their pastor, Gary Brandon, told detectives that the family had been involved in 'spiritual warfare.' Both Mr and Mrs Jamison had told him they had seen spirits at their Eufaula home. Mrs Jamison said the spirits of a long-dead family lived with them and that their daughter Madyson spoke with the youngest spirit. At one point, Mr Jamison asked his pastor whether he could obtain 'special bullets' to shoot the spirits. He later said he had consulted the 'satanic Bible' to find a cure to the spirits. Witchcraft: Both Mr and Mrs Jamison had talked about seeing 'spirits' at their home prior to their disappearance . Friends reported that the family had begun acting strangely and that both Mr and Mrs Jamison had lost a large amount of weight before they disappeared. The sheriff at the time concluded that the family had likely become involved in drugs - though no evidence of this was ever found. After they disappeared, a massive search effort was mobilized that included hundreds of volunteers, troopers from the Oklahoma State Highway Patrol and agents from both the FBI and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. Searchers combed the area on foot, on ATV and on horseback, but found nothing. Sixteen teams of dogs fanned out, but found nothing. Current Sheriff Jesse James said that the location of the skeletons could have been missed by rescuers are the family's bodies could have been covered in leaves that had fallen from the tree.","Bobby and Sherilyn Jamison and their daughter Madyson, 6, disappeared in October 2009 .

"A school today linked to the Trojan Horse scandal allegedly forced students to revise for exams in the street because staff did not want them speaking to inspectors. Fears that classrooms are being taken over by hardline Muslims have spread to Bradford  as it emerged Ofsted is sending officials to the city to see if strict Islamic rules are being imposed. Inspectors reportedly visited Laisterdyke Business and Enterprise College yesterday, and will likely visit Carlton Bolling College, where boys and girls have allegedly been segregated in classes and senior staff and governors visited a Birmingham school now in special measures. It emerged today that around 30 Year 11 pupils at Laisterdyke arrived for revision classes yesterday but were reportedly told they could not come in because Ofsted were inside. Photographs show students sitting on the pavement preparing for their GCSE exams. 'Turned away': Students at a Bradford school forced to revise outside when they were refused access to the school due to an Ofsted inspection . Claims: A councillor, and former governor at the school, said that the timetable said that they should have been allowed in but students said they had no choice but to sit outside . New claims: Students arrive at Laisterdyke Business and Enterprise College in Bradford this morning, which was reportedly visited by officials yesterday . Bradford Councillor Faisal Khan, a former governor, said: 'I just went to drop something off for the Ofsted inspection which I wanted them to see, and I  noticed there were loads of students standing outside. A Trojan Horse-linked academy spent £50,000 on a taxpayer-funded trip to Saudi Arabia for students and staff - and handed the contract to a travel company with links to a director at the school. Oldknow Academy was among five Birmingham schools rated as inadequate and placed in special measures by Ofsted on Monday, amid claims children were not being protected from extremism. Inspectors said young pupils had allegedly heard the phrase ‘white prostitute’ to describe Western women - and where the tombola was banned at a fete for being un-Islamic. The Education Funding Agency (EFA) had raised financial concerns about two publicly-funded Muslim-only trips to Saudi Arabia in 2012 and 2013, the latter costing £47,200. It was revealed today the contract for last year’s visit was handed to a Birmingham travel company, which has links to a current teacher and former director at the 600-pupil Small Heath school. The Agency investigation discovered the contract for the trips had never gone through a formal tender process. Last May 40 students and eight staff travelled to Mecca and Medinah. The ten-day visit involved stays at luxury five-star hotels. The trip was booked and organised through Hilal Tours and Travel Ltd, run by Umar Zaman, 38. Its website tells potential clients to send deposits of £500 to an address in Burlington Road, Erdington. Qamar Zaman, 43, was a director of Oldknow Educational Trust - which runs  Oldknow Academy - at the time the trips were booked and took place.He is currently working at Oldknow as an advanced skills teacher. Qamar Zaman was also listed as having lived at the Burlington Road address in 2007. He denied to the Birmingham Mail ever having links to Hilal Tours and Travel Ltd, and said an address listed on Companies House was not his. 'They said they weren’t allowed in but they were supposed to be revising in study sessions - and the timetable they showed me indicated this also. 'It says in black and white that they should have been there, but they were turned away at the last minute because an Ofsted inspector was inside. 'So they had no choice but to sit outside during the confusion.' The school’s senior vice-principal Richard McManus said today that parents of pupils sitting exams had been sent a letter including details of exam leave on Friday, and that it was made clear that although there were some revision sessions in the school, pupils were expected to study at home the rest of the time. However, a study guide supplied by one of the pupils sat outside states several sessions had been organised, which they were expected to attend. Inspectors are also believed to be planning an inspection at nearby Carlton Bolling College, which the BBC said has been accused of imposing a Muslim agenda on classrooms. These include segregating boys and girls in some classes. It follows claims that the colleges have links to a governor accused of orchestrating the so-called Trojan Horse campaign to takeover schools in Birmingham. Tahir Alam, governor of Birmingham's Park View school, where inspectors reported girls being discouraged from speaking to boys, spoke at a Muslim education forum set up by a governor at Carlton . Bolling and former governor at Laisterdyke, the Times reported today. The paper reported the head teacher of Carlton Bolling also visited Park View school, which continues to insist the claims made against it are 'politically motivated'. The new fears were raised as Ofsted . head, Sir Michael Wilshaw, back-tracked on a suggestion that the . Education Secretary had opposed his plans for inspectors to be allowed . to make ‘no-notice’ visits to schools. He . had claimed that he proposed the reform when he was first appointed two . years ago but that Mr Gove rejected it because it would be unpopular . among headteachers. Following an angry denial from the Education Secretary, Sir Michael issued a statement accepting that Mr Gove had a ‘long-standing’ commitment to the change. A move to allow snap inspections and a . requirement for all pupils to be taught about British values are two of . the main responses to the shocking revelations of inquiries into the . Trojan Horse campaign. One . school was said to have put on a hastily arranged show of ‘cultural . inclusivity’, with a lesson on Christianity, because it knew inspectors . were coming. Despite winning his row with Sir . Michael over inspections, Mr Gove is under pressure on a number of . fronts in the wake of the scandal. Retaliation: Education Secretary Michael Gove forced the head of Ofsted to take back his claim that he had rejected the idea of snap inspections two years ago . Nick . Clegg insisted that academies and free schools should be obliged to . teach from a core curriculum – which they currently do not have to do – . to prevent any further campaigns to change schools’ ethos and character. Taking it back: Sir Michael Wilshaw had to admit that Michael Gove has a long-standing commitment to change of inspections of schools . Mr Gove’s Conservative colleague, Baroness Warsi, distancing herself from his response to the Trojan Horse revelations, suggested he should ensure he did not ‘make matters worse’ by alienating Muslims. She also rejected suggestions that there was a ‘conveyor belt’ between conservative Islam and violent Islamist extremism, a claim made by Mr Gove in a 2006 book. ‘I don’t think there is necessarily a link and I’ve yet to see a definitive piece of evidence which shows that religiosity in any religion equates terrorism,’ she said. Despite speculation that he could be moved in a forthcoming Cabinet reshuffle. Mr Gove was backed by David Cameron, who set out a list of ‘British values’ he wanted taught in all schools. Professor Chris Husbands, director of the Institute of Education, said the idea of a set of values to prepare youngsters for lives as citizens was a good one, but he warned defining British values was much easier in the ‘abstract than in the detail’. Mr Gove’s former aide Dominic Cummings has said the idea of teaching meaningful British values will get bogged down in legal challenges under human rights law. He predicted that Number Ten would be demanding ‘some eye-catching gimmicks that DC [David Cameron] can wheel out on British values’. Labour MPs pointed to Mr Gove’s attack on Gordon Brown’s attempts to draw up British values in 2007, when he declared: ‘There is something rather unBritish about seeking to define Britishness.’","Concerns schools in Bradford may also have been targeted by hardliners .

"It’s widely accepted than in 5 billion years our Milky Way will collide with the nearby Andromeda galaxy - but what will happen when it does? In a new simulation scientists have revealed the intricate process that will take place, with the two central supermassive black holes merging into one. And the newly formed super-galaxy, dubbed ‘Milkomeda’, will also ultimately spell disaster for Earth as our planet is flung out into interstellar space. A simulation (shown) created by the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (Icrar) in Western Australia has revealed the formation of 'Milkomeda'. This is the name given to the super-galaxy that will be created when the Milky Way and Andromeda collide in 5 billion years . The simulation was created by a number of institutions led by the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (Icrar) in Western Australia. In the simulation it can be seen how the two galaxies will interact as they approach each other. First, in a tentative meeting, they will ‘swoop’ past each other, possibly disrupting some of the orbits of stars in the arms of each spiral galaxy. Then, after separating, the two galaxies will accelerate towards each other again. The Milky Way is thought to be 120,000 light years across and contains about 300 billion stars. This makes it a ‘middleweight’ galaxy with the largest galaxy known, IC 1101, containing more than 100 trillion stars. On a clear night, when you look up into the night sky the most you can see from any one point on the Earth is about 2,500 stars. Like more than two-thirds of the known galaxies, the Milky Way has a spiral shape. At the centre of the spiral, a lot of energy and, occasionally, vivid flares are created. Based on the immense gravity that would be required to explain the movement of stars and the energy expelled, the centre of the Milky Way is thought to have a supermassive black hole like many other galaxies in the universe. As Andromeda is larger than the Milky Way, with one trillion stars in the former compared to about 300 billion in the latter, it will technically be the one ‘eating’ our galaxy. The Milky Way is also expected to ‘eat’ two nearby dwarf galaxies, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, at some point in the future. And studies have also suggested the third largest galaxy in our Local Group, called the Triangulum Galaxy or M33, may also be involved in the collision of the Milky Way and Andromeda. In the video, gas is shown in blue and newly formed stars in red - meaning those that formed over the duration of the simulation. ‘As the galaxies come together, mutual gravity leads to gas and stars being flung out in the form of tidal arms,’ Dr Chris Power of Icrar explains. ‘The first passage does little damage to the galaxies; it's on the second and subsequent encounters that gravitational interactions have most effect, with huge clouds of gas undergoing shocks and collapsing to create bursts of star formation that lead to powerful supernovae-driven winds. ‘At late times, gas that was expelled from the galaxy falls back in and settles into a rapidly rotating compact disc. ‘Although we show only the newly formed stars, the stellar discs and bulges of the Milky Way and Andromeda will have merged to form a massive elliptical galaxy, shaped like a rugby ball.’ As Andromeda (right) is larger than the Milky Way (left), with one trillion stars in the former compared to about 300 billion in the latter, it will technically be the one ‘eating’ our galaxy. The Milky Way is also expected to ‘eat’ two nearby dwarf galaxies, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, at some point in the future . The data for the research was collected by the Anglo-Australian Telescope in New South Wales as part of the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (Gama) survey, which involves more than 90 scientists and took more than seven years to complete. Owing to the huge distances between stars, it’s unlikely that any two will collide. For example, the nearest star to our own sun is Proxima Centauri, 4.2 light years away. If the sun were the size of a ping pong ball, Proxima Centauri would be a pea about 680 miles (1,100km) away. With the average distance between stars being 100 billion miles (160 billion km), it’s unlikely any two will collide when the merger happens. Nonetheless, its likely that the supermassive black hole at the centre of each galaxy will converge. These will converge near the centre of Milkomeda, transferring additional orbital energy to stars over millions of years. Some simulations predict that this event will see Earth brought nearer the centre of the combined galaxy before being flung out of the super-galaxy. Ultimately, gravity is expected to cause all the galaxies in bound groups and clusters in the universe to merge into a few super-giant galaxies like this, although it will be many billions of years before this takes place. Is this what the collision will look like from Earth? As Andromeda approaches it will become much larger in the night sky before merging with the Milky Way. Some simulations predict that this event will see Earth brought nearer the centre of the combined galaxy before being flung out of the new super-galaxy .","A simulation created by the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (Icrar) in Western Australia shows the formation of 'Milkomeda'

Belgrade-based tabloid Kurir claim the pair met last summer in Ibiza and have been speaking frequently via Skype.

"Arsene Wenger will one day sit down, take a deep breath and remember his remarkably long career at Arsenal. But that will have to wait until he finally calls time on his reign. The 64-year-old celebrates 18 years since he took over the north London club on Wednesday, but insists he does not have time to look back over almost two decades there — especially with a crucial Champions League group stage game against Galatasaray marking his anniversary. He is one of the last of a dying breed of long-standing managers who were afforded time and patience to build an empire, watch it grow, nurture it, then start over again when it floundered. Arsene Wenger celebrates 18 years as Arsenal manager on Wednesday but is only looking forward for now . Alan Pardew is the next longest-serving manager in the Premier League having been in his job just four years . Alan Pardew at Newcastle is the closest boss in the top flight to the Frenchman — with just four seasons at the helm — but his tenure is dangerously close to ending. Wenger said: ‘It’s a great honour and privilege to be in charge of such a big club for such a long time, but I have no time to look back right now, I will do it at another time. 'I never look back. What is always your target is to take the maximum potential out of the team. The Arsenal manager celebrates his 18th year in charge at Arsenal on Wednesday. Here are some of his key numbers: . 1,021 Games in charge at Arsenal. He has won 590, drawn 230 and lost 201. 13 Trophies won by Wenger at Arsenal: three League titles, five FA Cups and five Community Shields. 1,880 Arsenal goals under Wenger — an average of 1.84 per game. 1,353 Premier League points won. Only Sir Alex Ferguson (1,752) has more. 1st In 1998, Wenger became the first foreign manager to win the English league title. 57.8 Overall Arsenal win percentage. 'The only thing I would say this season is that this team has huge potential and it has to come out. At the moment I am more worried about that.’ He added: ‘For the rest, Champions League evolution, maybe it was more open 15 years ago than it is today. The concentration of the big players in a small number of clubs is much more than it was before. ‘It’s much more predictable, the outcome of the Champions League, than it was 10 years ago. It’s harder to win it. 'If you make a poll tomorrow and say to people “Give me four clubs who will win the Champions League”, 80 or 90 per cent of people will say they are these four clubs. ‘I don’t think that we are one of the four who will be favourites to win it, but football is strange and not always predictable.’ Former Italy boss Cesare Prandelli watches over Galatasaray training on the pitch at the Emirates Stadium . Wesley Sneijder and his teammates will be looking to inflict back-to-back defeats on Arsene Wenger's side . The competition winners may be predictable for the Frenchman, but he could not have envisaged the sound beating his side were given by Borussia Dortmund in their opening match. It was the first time in 11 years they had lost an opening group game in the competition. The last time, a Wednesday night in 2003, they were hammered 3-0 by Inter Milan at home but still went on to top their group and reach the quarter-finals, where they were eliminated by Chelsea. ‘One thing that has not changed compared to 18 years ago, the players were very intelligent and they are still very intelligent today,’ said Wenger. ‘They know what is at stake. Mathematically they know Galatasaray is the game for us.’ Back in 2003-04, Wenger’s team became The Invincibles as undefeated league champions, which he will surely fondly recall. Arsenal lost their first game of this year's Champions League, going down 2-0 to Borussia Dortmund . It was the first time in 11 years that they lost on the opening day, and Wenger has never lost his first two . Jack Wilshere is fit enough to make the Arsenal squad as they look to revive their Champions League hopes . But defeat at home to Galatasaray will heap pressure on qualifying for the knockout stages and would bring a more painful memory to mind for Wenger — who has never lost the opening two games in a Champions League campaign. On Wednesday, Wenger will make a decision on whether to start Jack Wilshere after he turned his ankle against Tottenham. It was feared the midfielder would be out for a lengthy spell, but he came through training on Tuesday, when he looked sharp. Aaron Ramsey, who has a hamstring injury, and Mikel Arteta, struggling with a calf problem, also suffered significant problems in that match and will be out for at least three weeks. Kieran Gibbs is set to start in the absence of Nacho Monreal, and Wenger has tipped the injury-prone left back to become England’s long-term replacement to Ashley Cole. German trio Per Mertesacker (right), Mesut Ozil (centre) and Lukas Podolski (left) are all in the squad . Wenger believes Kieran Gibbs could be England's next left back, emulating former Arsenal man Ashley Cole . Indeed, national team manager Roy Hodgson and his assistant Ray Lewington will be at the Emirates tonight to monitor Gibbs, along with Arsenal’s other English players. Wenger revealed on Tuesday that he only allowed Gael Clichy to leave for Manchester City in 2011 to give Gibbs a chance. ‘For a long time there was no discussion, it was Ashley Cole for England. Now it’s a bit more open,’ explained Wenger. ‘Gibbs has such great potential, if he lets it go.’ Wenger nurtured the teenage Cole from a forward into one of the world’s best full backs and similarly moved Gibbs back when he joined the club as a winger aged 16. Asked if Gibbs, now 25, can reach Cole’s level, Wenger replied: ‘Yes, it’s a good example to follow. When it mattered and when you had to be there, he was always there.’ Like our Arsenal Facebook page.

"Withdrawn: Diacetyl was discovered inside a VIP butterscotch flavour liquid refill bottle (file picture) A potentially harmful chemical linked to lung disease has been found in an e-cigarette sold in Britain, it was claimed today. Diacetyl - a chemical safe to eat, but not to inhale - was discovered inside a VIP butterscotch flavour liquid refill bottle purchased at the Metrocentre in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear. Laboratory tests were carried out on four types of liquid, with the other three safe - but the butterscotch product has since been withdrawn. Lynne White - head of retail distribution at VIP, one of Britain’s biggest e-cigarette firms - said the company had already detected the chemical through its testing, and the product should have been withdrawn a week before it was purchased. She told BBC One investigative show Inside Out: ‘Because of the small amount the vaper would actually consume it was deemed in the short term there would be no health concerns. ‘Long term, yes there could well be - however, we decided it was a withdrawal rather than a recall of the product and that was based on Ecita (Electronic Cigarette Industry Trade Association) guidelines. This is our first issue in five years. 'We sell millions of bottles a year. We are very sorry it has happened, we are investigating how it has happened’. Investigators spoke to Dr Graham Burns, a consultant physician in respiratory and general medicine. Dr Burns, who works for Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘Diacetyl - is associated with an unusual but well-established lung condition called ""popcorn worker's lung"". Scroll down for video . Response: VIP said it sells 'millions of bottles a year' and this was its 'first issue in five years' (file picture from Ecigclick.co.uk) ‘It has been inhaled in significant quantities in people who worked in popcorn manufacturing factories. In those individuals it has caused a very serious lung condition.' He added: ‘E-cigarettes are as yet . entirely unregulated so at the moment if you go out on to the streets, . buy an e-cigarette you have no idea and I have no idea what you are . putting into your lungs.’ It . comes after the World Health Organisation insisted last week that . electronic cigarettes should be banned from indoors and face a raft of . new curbs over safety fears. The . organisation, which is the public health arm of the UN, . claimed they pose a risk to bystanders of ‘toxicant’ emissions and . warned there was limited evidence they help smokers quit. A report said legal steps need to be taken to end the use of e-cigarettes in public indoor spaces and workplaces – and to ban sales to children. Around 2.1million Britons use battery-powered e-cigarettes, which allow users to inhale nicotine but avoid the harm caused by tobacco smoke. The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency decided they must be regulated as medicines to make them ‘safer and more effective’, but this is not due until 2016. But a major scientific review last month, which looked at 81 studies of e-cigarettes, found they caused less harm than smoking. Bronchiolitis obliterans is an inflammatory obstruction of the bronchioles, which are the lung's smallest airways. The condition restricts the flow of air out of the lungs, causing a dry cough and wheezing. One cause of the condition is thought to be the inhalation of diacetyl. The chemical is used to make butter-like flavouring in microwaveable popcorn. The condition first came to public attention when eight former employees of the Gilster-Mary Lee popcorn plant in Missouri developed it in the late 1990s. And two years ago a court in Colorado awarded £4million in damages to a man who developed the condition after eating a few packs of popcorn every day for ten years.","Diacetyl discovered inside a VIP butterscotch flavour liquid refill bottle .

"Britain and the United States have dropped down a league table which rates the freedom of the press across the world, it emerged today. The UK’s slide from 19th to 28th place is partly blamed on fallout from the phone hacking scandal at the News Of The World which prompted the Leveson Inquiry into press ethics. Researchers from watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RWB), who compiled the World Press Freedom Index, also highlighted liberal libel laws which allow claimants of any nationality to sue in its courts. Libel 'tourism' is seen as a way for the richest to clamp down on freedom of expression. There were also concerns that the police had attempted to extract information from a number of private companies – including Blackberry – to identify looters during the London riots. League table: This map of the world shows countries with the most press freedom coloured white and the least coloured black . America’s performance was even worse. It dropped from 20th to 47th position on the back of heavy-handed police tactics at a string of demonstrations against corporate greed. A number of journalists – as well as protesters – were arrested as the Occupy movement swept across the country. Heather Blake, from RWB, described the statistics as a worrying trend. ‘The West prides itself on supporting the principles of free speech and freedom of expression,’ she said. ‘If we are going to promote these principles across the rest of the world, then we’ve got to make sure that we uphold them ourselves.’ In the UK's case, there are fears that the Leveson Inquiry could have further-reaching consequences than anyone initially envisaged. Long-overdue reform of archaic libel laws would make it more difficult for foreign nationals to sue through British courts However, there is some suggestion that Parliament could delay enacting them into law because of Leveson. There is also the possibility that the press could face formal regulation for the first time. The Press Freedom  index reflected a year of upheaval, protest and revolution worldwide - though participation in the Arab Spring was no guarantee of an improved rating. While Tunisia (up to 134 from 164) and Libya (160 to 154) fared well, Egypt dropped from 127 to 166 after a wave of detentions by the army in the wake of the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak. Syria, Bahrain and Yemen – where dictators clung to power by brutally suppressing protesters  - racked up their worst-ever ratings. Of the 179 countries on the index, Syria came in at 176 (173 in 2010) while Bahrain ranked at 173, a drop of 29 places. Bottom of the table were Turkmenistan, North Korea and Eritrea. Finland, Norway and the Netherlands claimed the top spots. The biggest fall was by Malawi, which dropped 67 places to 146 after the suppression of protests last summer. Niger, meanwhile, leapt spectacularly to 29th place – just one spot below the UK. ‘This year’s index sees many changes in the rankings, changes that reflect a year that was incredibly rich in developments, especially in the Arab world,’ RWB noted. ‘Many media paid dearly for their coverage of democratic aspirations or opposition movements. ‘Control of news and information continued to tempt governments and to be a question of survival for totalitarian and repressive regimes. ‘Crackdown was the word of the year in 2011. Never has freedom of information been so closely associated with democracy . ‘It is no surprise that the same trio of countries, Eritrea, Turkmenistan and North Korea, absolute dictatorships that permit no civil liberties, again occupy the last three places in the index. ‘This year, they are immediately preceded at the bottom by Syria, Iran and China, three countries that seem to have lost contact with reality as they have been sucked into an insane spiral of terror, and by Bahrain and Vietnam, quintessential oppressive regimes.’ The index is compiled by a team of RWB researchers who use a series of questions to rank each country. These address areas such as violence and abusive treatment of journalists, state-interference such as surveillance of members of the media and censorship. RWB revised this year's questions to attempt to avoid a Western bias.","Britain slides from 19th to 28th place on back of phone hacking, Leveson Inquiry and 'libel tourists'

"Men who smoked marijuana heavily at age 18 are more likely to end up registered as disabled by the time they reach 60, researchers have warned. However, scientists say it Is unclear whether the pot use in adolescence may have led to more severe substance abuse - or was an early sign of psychiatric or social factors that contributed to later disability. The researchers behind the long-term study of Swedish men warned the increase in use could lead to problems among an aging population. Marijuana is one of the most commonly used illicit drugs in the world . Marijuana is one of the most commonly used illicit drugs in the world, with 77 million Europeans reporting having tried it in a recent study. Pot use in the U.S. has been on the rise since 2007, possibly due in part to a perception of diminishing risks. Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize the possession and use of recreational marijuana by adults in 2012. 'There is reason to believe that the associations found in our study develop over a long period of time and are intertwined with problems in the labor market, in the social security system, and with the individual,' said study leader Anna‐Karin Danielsson of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. The researchers found that men who used marijuana more than 50 times before the age of 18 were 30 percent more likely to go on disability sometime between the ages of 40 and 59. A similar pattern was seen for young men who used pot less frequently, with the chance of being on disability in middle age rising with increasing pot use at age 18. However, when the study team adjusted for other factors, including socioeconomic background, other substance use by age 18, psychiatric diagnoses and other health problems, the link remained statistically significant – meaning it could not have been due to chance – only for the heaviest users who had smoked pot more than 50 times as young men. That group already had a number of problems in their teens, the researchers note in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence. Of the 654 heaviest pot users at age 18, 80 percent also reported using other drugs, 47 percent reported risky alcohol use and 55 percent had a psychiatric diagnosis. Danielsson said that smoking marijuana at a young age may increase the risk of negative social consequences later on in life, and that prior studies have shown frequent marijuana use increases the risk of using other illicit drugs. 'It may be the case that adolescent cannabis use may lead to a series of negative life events such as, for example, subsequent illicit drug use, illness (e.g., dependence) and associated disability pensions,' she said. The study cannot prove that pot use in the teen years caused the men to end up on disability later in life, the researchers acknowledge. They don't know how much marijuana the men used after they entered the military or many other details of their lives after age 18. Despite the study's limitations, the findings highlight the need for further studies on marijuana and other illicit drug use in relation to possible health and social consequences, the study authors conclude. Pot use in the U.S. has been on the rise since 2007, possibly due in part to a perception of diminishing risks. Studies continue to link cannabis with a variety of psychiatric and health problems as well as adverse social consequences, Danielsson said. The research is limited, though, by short follow-up times and small study samples, she told Reuters Health in an email. 'With our unique Swedish cohort of men comprising 98 percent of the male population at baseline and a 39-year long follow-up time, we had the opportunity to expand on existing knowledge,' Danielsson said. She and her colleagues analyzed data from a large study that included almost 50,000 men born between 1949 and 1951 and conscripted into compulsory military service in 1969 and 1970. When the men entered the military, they were asked about their drug, tobacco and alcohol use, as well as questions about their family and social backgrounds, school performance, behavior, psychological issues and general health. Danielsson's team was specifically interested in the frequency of marijuana use at age 18, when the men were conscripted. The young men were grouped according to how often they had ever used pot at that point: never, 1‐10 times, 11‐50 times or more than 50 times. Next, the study team looked at data from the Swedish national social insurance agency, the education registry and labor market statistics to see how many were granted disability pensions through 2008. About 9 percent of the teens reported having used marijuana when they entered the military, and 1.5 percent said they had used it more than 50 times.","Men who used marijuana more than 50 times before the age of 18 were 30% more likely to go on disability sometime between the ages of 40 and 59 .

"A chef at a mice-infested wedding cake shop told inspectors droppings found in his ingredients were chocolate sprinkles, a court heard. The filthy basement of Bake & Cake in Edgware Road, central London, was covered in rodent mess alongside discarded food, piles of sawdust and filthy machinery. When an inspector found icing for cakes 'embedded' with mouse droppings, the chef insisted it was actually chocolate vermicelli used for buns. Nasty taste: Former Bake & Cake manager Hussein Hassan appeared in court today after claiming mouse droppings were chocolate . Icing on the cake: Health inspectors took this photograph of rodent faeces on ingredients used in the wedding cake shop . The shop’s former manager Hussein Hassan, 43, was today hauled before Westminster Magistrates Court to answer for the squalid conditions. Inspectors from Westminster Council raided the premises on July 17 last year and immediately discovered a series mouse infestation. ‘She pulled out trays in the cooling rack and found mouse droppings embedded in the circular disk used to add writing to cakes’, said prosecutor Marie-Claire Amuah. ‘When she queried this to the chef, he stated the mouse droppings were chocolate vermicelli used as decoration on cakes and buns. ‘She pulled out a tray of triangles of white chocolate, and found some mouse dropping embedded in the chocolate, meaning the mouse had to walk over it to be there. ‘There were more embedded droppings closer to the edge and under the greaseproof paper.’ Excuse: The chef at the mice-infested shop maintained the mouse mess was chocolate sprinkles . Pretty gross: These delicate icing dove are shown here surrounded by dropping in a shocking hygiene case . A sponge used for food preparation was found covered in mouse dirt and further searches revealed every room of the basement of the bakery had evidence of mice infestation. Ms Amuah: ‘The area where the pipes ran into the ground was filthy and there were mouse droppings present. ‘A box with icing inside had mouse droppings on the top of the plastic bag used to cover it and metal racking used to store cooling trays had mouse droppings along them. ‘There was also a large amount of chocolate icing debris on the floor of the area. ‘The amount of debris present in the room was far in excess of that from a morning’s work, indicating there was poor cleaning.’ Inspectors also found sawdust next to an electrical junction box, which may have been the nesting area for the mice. The basement was said to be in a poor general condition, with peeling paint and dirty equipment, as well as mouse droppings in the back of a juice extractor. They also found fresh excrement just inches from pre-prepared pastry, bags of flour and chocolate icing. Disgrace: Rodent mess was on the icing alongside discarded food piles of sawdust and filthy machinery . Nine days earlier, managers had been warned to clean up their act but took no notice. The shop, which has been open for five years, was shut down on the spot after the raid to undergo a £5,000 clean-up. It was reopened ten days later and regained its level three hygiene rating following a fresh inspection in June this year. Hassan, the only person who turned up to court today, said he no longer worked fulltime as manager and earned only £150 a week in a new part-time role. District Judge Elizabeth Roscoe fined him £300 and ordered him to pay prosecution costs of £1,300 after he admitted five health and safety breaches. But she hit the company much harder after it failed to produce any evidence of turnover and the owner flew off on holiday instead of attending the hearing. ‘This was a serious breach, it was extensive, and it wasn’t just in one place or a small amount’, she said. ‘This really was extensive to the extent that a prohibition notice had to be served. ‘That shows how bad it was.’ Bake and Cake, owned by Bon Croissant Ltd, was fined £5,000 and ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge and £1,319.50 prosecution costs. Both the firm and Hassan pleaded guilty to five counts of contravening a provision of the food hygiene regulations.","Mouse excrement was imbedded in icing used for cakes and buns .

"Justin Bieber has apologised a second time for video footage showing him making racist remarks. He was forced to make his latest apology after a second video emerged showing Bieber singing his hit song One Less Lonely Girl, but changing the final words to ‘lonely n*****’. The singer, who fans branded ‘an arrogant little twerp’ over the footage, also uses sick lyrics about killing black people and joining the Ku Klux Klan. Scroll down for video (warning: explicit content) Footage: A 14-Year-Old Justin sings 'One Less Lonely N*****', an adaption of his hit 'One Less Lonely Girl' where he talks about murdering a black man and joining the racist KKK . The 24-second clip follows the release of a video a few days ago in which he asked: ‘Why are black people afraid of chainsaws?’ before imitating the noise of a chainsaw and saying: ‘Run n*****, n*****, n*****, n*****, n*****’. The footage will further jeopardise his career, which has already suffered from a string of run-ins with police in America and his native Canada. Now he has apologised - once again - for the latest controversial footage. He told The Sun: 'Facing my mistakes from years ago has been one of the hardest things I've ever dealt with. 'But I feel now that I need to take responsibility for those mistakes and not let them linger. 'At the end of the day, I just need to step up and own what I did.' He said in a statement: ‘I’m very sorry. I take my friendships with people of all  cultures very seriously and apologise for offending or hurting anyone with my  childish and inexcusable mistake. ‘I was a kid then and I am a man now who knows my responsibility to the world and to not make that mistake again.’ Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames. Racists: The popstar was reportedly caught on camera changing the lyrics of his song One Less Lonely Girl to sing 'one less lonely n*****' - and joked about joining white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan (file picture) Bieber, 20, who has sold more than 15million albums and earned a reported £80million, blamed the first video, filmed when he was 15, on youthful indiscretion. In the latest footage Bieber wears a blue shirt and a dog tag necklace. A female friend can be . heard laughing in the background, and the singer smiles as he gives his . twisted rendition of Lonely Girl, the original version of which has been . viewed 203million times on YouTube. The Ku Klux Klan was a racist organisation set up in Tennessee in 1866 to resist plans to create racial equality. Believing in white supremacy, the US group's members terrorised leaders, both black and white, who called for greater integration. Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest was the first leader, or 'grand wizard', and presided over a hierarchy of 'grand dragons', 'grand titans' and 'grand cyclopses'. Members of the group - which is also known for being anti-Catholic - wore white costumes with masks and conical hats designed to scare opponents and hide their identities. After dying out in the 1870s, the group was reformed around 1915 and took up the sign of the burning cross at rallies. Partly fuelled by fears over immigration from the First World War and Russian revolution in Europe, the group swelled to its largest ever size of around 4million members in the 1920s. Despite a slight resurgence during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s, the group has slowly died away and is now thought to have fewer than 5,000 members. Last night show business . website TMZ reported that the new video was captured when Bieber was . 14, after he had seen a comedian’s parody of Lonely Girl. The website also claimed . Bieber had  realised at the time that making the recording was a . mistake, and had told his mentor, the R’n’B star Usher Raymond, and . actor Will Smith. Mr Raymond rebuked him and showed him videos to . illustrate the evils of racial prejudice, it reported. What's more, TMZ reports that the Young Money Entertainment clan, which features the likes of 'Lil Wayne and Birdman – who Justin regularly hangs out with – are supporting the Never Say Never hitmaker. Mack Maine, President of Young Money, is quoted by the website as saying: 'Bieber does not have a slave mentality.  He treats his people with respect.' Fans in Britain and the US – who call themselves ‘Beliebers’ – left him in no doubt about their dismay last night. One, LizaCar, said: ‘He needs to go back to school, get an education, receive [some] discipline and learn some respect. ‘He’s out of control and it’s not going to have a happy ending the rate it’s going.’ Jamal Jackson, from . Liverpool, wrote: ‘No I don’t care, you know there are certain words you . shouldn’t use and that’s hurtful words against other people. Sorry . Justin you can’t type a little message on twitter and get out of it!’ Another online commenter branded the baby-faced singer an ‘arrogant little twerp’. A user calling . themselves Disgruntled Reader, from California, said: ‘The KKK isn’t . funny, racism isn’t funny and using the n-word isn’t funny. People were terrorized, . abused and murdered over the  colour of their skin at one time, and . making a joke of it is nothing short of breathtaking stupidity and . arrogance.’ Twitter users in the US . mocked the singer by posting a picture of KKK members apparently saying: . ‘We would like to  distance ourselves from Mr Bieber. All organisations . have a few embarrassing members.’ The white supremacist Ku Klux Klan lynched hundreds of black people in the southern US. Showing him the way: Usher took Justin aside and showed him some racist videos to help him understand why his behaviour was so terrible . Turning to God: As well as his apology, Bieber posted this Bible passage on Wednesday, from the book of John and from Isaiah, both passages relate to forgiveness . 'I'm sorry': Bieber apologised for the earlier video clip this week, saying that when he was a child he did not realise how certain words could hurt, adding that he learned from his mistakes . Bieber shot to fame as a 15 year old in 2009 when his YouTube songs – recorded in his bedroom – became a global phenomenon. Since then he has sold more than 15million albums and earned a reported £80million. But . the singer has shed his clean-cut, Christian image in favour of tattoos . and gangster clothing and has been embroiled in a series of . controversies thanks to his increasingly hedonistic lifestyle. In . January, the singer’s home in Los Angeles was searched by police after . he allegedly threw eggs at a neighbour’s house. Officers found two jars . of cannabis and cocaine and arrested one of his friends. The . following week, Bieber himself was arrested for allegedly drag-racing . his Lamborghini on a public street in Miami and being over the . drink-drive limit. Last year . he upset thousands of fans in London by arriving late for a concert, . spitting on fans from a balcony and lashing out at a photographer in a . street. He was also . pictured allegedly smoking cannabis at a party, while drugs and a Taser . handgun were found on his tour bus in Sweden. The videos are likely to . disappoint the black artists who have worked with Bieber, including . Will.i.am and Nicki Minaj. Usher Raymond has yet to offer any . comments in support of his protegé. However, on Thursday Lil Wayne and other members of Young Money Entertainment were quick to say they still supported Bieber and had dismissed his 'mistake'. After a string of . outrageous antics, Bieber’s clean-cut Christian image has been replaced . by that of a tattooed bad boy who once spat on fans from a balcony. He has been charged with . assault in Toronto for allegedly punching a limousine driver in the . back of the head while he was driving him and his entourage. He has pleaded not . guilty to  driving under the influence and driving with an expired . licence after being caught allegedly drag racing in a yellow Lamborghini . in Miami Beach, Florida. The Los Angeles County . Sheriff’s Department is still investigating him after eggs were thrown . at his neighbour’s home in Calabasas, California. When police raided . Bieber’s mansion they found cocaine left ‘in plain view’ and arrested . his rapper friend Lil Za for drug possession. His actions have . provoked such a backlash in the US that a White House petition calling . for the Canadian to be kicked out of the US reached more than 180,000 . signatures. TMZ last night claimed . Bieber had been approached two months ago by a man who wanted £650,000 . for the first video, of the racist joke, but his PR team refused. The man then supposedly . asked for half that sum but Bieber’s  people refused again, saying they . did not think it would do much damage since he was so young.","Popstar 'caught on camera changing lyrics of song One Less Lonely Girl'

"Hillary . Clinton urges caution on 'under-delivering' Assad . Syria's brazen dictator took time out from orchestrating the brutal crackdown of his own citizens to walk around the battered Baba Amr neighbourhood of Homs. Bashar Assad arrogantly strutted around the ravaged district - the former rebel stronghold which until March 1 was under siege as his troops pounded its civilians almost into oblivion. Heavily flanked by security, the ruthless regime leader yesterday told the few remaining residents not killed in the month-long bombardment that they would 'return better than before'. He said 'normal life' would soon resume - at the same time as the death toll for the year-long conflict escalated to a staggering 9,000. Scroll down for video... Hailed: President Bashar Assad pictured surrounded by supporters on his first visit to the Baba Amr neighbourhood, which was once a rebel stronghold . Reassuring: Assad toured the former rebel . stronghold of Baba Amr, in Homs, and told residents that the battered . neighbourhood would be rebuilt and that normal life would resume . People person: Assad showed extreme audacity by returning to the district which, until just four weeks ago, was a rebel stronghold full of activists who wanted him ousted from power . During his apparent show of control . he appeared relaxed, wearing a blue shirt and sports coat, as he shook . hands and hugged supporters and soldiers who shouted 'we are with you . until death'. * Syria commits to work with Annan 'in an inclusive Syrian-led political process to address the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people' * Syria commits to stop fighting and immediately stop troop movements and use of heavy weapons in populated areas. Syria should work with Annan to end all violence, under UN supervision. Annan will seek similar commitments from opposition to stop fighting . * Syria accepts and implements a daily two hour 'humanitarian pause' to deliver aid and evacuate the injured . * Syria commits to intensify 'the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons' and provide a list of all places where such people are being held . * Syria commits to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists 'and a non-discriminatory visa policy for them' * Syria commits to 'respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully as legally guaranteed' These terms have reportedly been accepted by the Syrian government. His audacious walkabout came as Kofi Annan . claimed a major breakthrough in the Syrian conflict which he hopes will . lead to a ceasefire from its brutal government troops. The United Nations' envoy said he had . received regime backing for a six-point plan which will see a daily . two-hour halt in fighting to evacuate the injured. Annan also claimed to have reached an agreement, crucially backed by China . and Russia, for Syrian-led political talks to address the concerns of . citizens. Annan's spokesman said he believes Syria's acceptance of the peace plan is an important first step which now needs to be immediately implemented. Annan, who is also an envoy for the Arab League, told reporters after meeting with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in Beijing yesterday he had received a 'positive' response from Syria as well as support from China. He said he received a similar commitment from Russia over the weekend. 'We've had very good discussions about the situation in Syria. And they have offered me their full support,' Annan said after the meeting with Wen. Wen said work on a solution to the crisis is at a 'critical juncture', adding that China backed Annan's mediation efforts. The support from China and Russia may . have been important in nudging Syria on the plan, which has been . endorsed by the UN Security Council in a non-binding presidential . statement. Agreement: Kofi Annan (left), the UN envoy to . Syria, met with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao (right) today - and said he . had his support in his six-point plan . Destruction: Heavy shelling by Syrian government forces has reduced Qusair to rubble . China and Russia have twice vetoed proposed UN sanctions over Assad's crackdown on a year long uprising in which more than 9,000 people are believe to have died. The two countries called those proposed UN resolutions unbalanced, saying they blamed only the Syrian government and demanded an end to government attacks, but not ones by the opposition. Annan views Syria's acceptance of the plan 'as an important initial step that could bring an end to the violence and the bloodshed. It could also, he believes, provide aid to the suffering, and create an environment conducive to a political dialogue that would fulfil the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people. Under fire: Syrian rebels take their position behind a sand barrier, in the Khaldiyeh neighbourhood in Homs today . Could it soon be over? Kofi Annan has hailed a major breakthrough in talks with Syrian officials - which could see a ceasefire and ending of awful scenes such as this one in the city of Homs . Annan 'stressed that implementation will be key, not only for the Syrian people, who are caught in the middle of this tragedy, but also for the region and the international community as a whole'. UN Human rights chief Navi Pillay today claimed children were being held in detention, without medical care, in 'horrendous' tactics by Assad's regime. She said: 'They've gone for the children - for whatever purposes - in large numbers. Hundreds detained and tortured... it's just horrendous. 'Children shot in the knees, held together with adults in really inhumane conditions, denied medical treatment for their injuries, either held as hostages or as sources of information. 'That is the legal situation. Factually there is enough evidence pointing to the fact many of these acts are committed by the security forces and must have received the approval or the complicity at the highest level. 'Because President Assad could simply issue an order to stop the killings and the killings would stop.' Syrian opposition members reacted with scepticism, however. Rami Jarah, who was attending an opposition meeting today in Turkey, said President Bashar Assad is trying to stall for time. He said: 'The Syrian government is going to depend on propaganda as it has over the past few months - propaganda of armed terrorists.' Bassma Kodmani, Paris-based member of the opposition Syrian National Council, said she welcomed the regime's acceptance of the plan. But when asked if she believed the regime would honour the plan, she only said: 'We hope that we can move toward a peace process.' Louay Safi, of the opposition Syrian National Council, said: 'We are not sure if it's political maneuvering or a sincere act. We have no trust in the current regime. ... We have to see that they have stopped killing civilians.' And U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Assad must now act. She said: 'Given Assad's history of overpromising and under-delivering, that commitment must now be matched by immediate action. We will judge Assad's sincerity and seriousness by what he does, not by what he says. 'If he is ready to bring this dark chapter in Syria's history to a close, he could prove it by immediately ordering regime forces to stop firing and begin withdrawing from populated areas.' British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Assad's decision was only a first step, saying: 'We will continue to judge the Syrian regime by its practical actions, not by its often empty words.' Rubble: The violence in Syria could soon come to an end, if the major breakthrough hailed by Kofi Annan is as crucial as he says . A grab taken from a video uploaded to YouTube yesterday (see below) shows smoke billowing from reported shelling by Syrian government forces on a residential area in the flashpoint central city of Homs . About 60 countries, including the United . States, are to attend a 'Friends of the Syrian People' conference in . Istanbul on Sunday. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said yesterday that China was invited but would not attend. Washington and many of its allies have said Assad has lost all legitimacy and must step down. China says the crisis needs to be resolved through talks. The conference in Istanbul comes as Turkey edges closer to setting up a buffer zone in Syria to protect civilians. Turkish officials have long been hesitant about the idea. But they now say a surge of refugees from Syria might compel Turkey, preferably with international backing, to establish a buffer zone on Syrian soil to guarantee the security of its own southern border as well as the welfare of civilians fleeing violence. Chinese analysts said Beijing was unlikely to support the buffer zone proposal, especially if the possibility of Western military action against Syria is not ruled out. 'China will not accept that proposal. But it will not openly oppose it either,' said Wang Lian, a Middle East expert at the School of International Studies at Peking University. Stopped: China and Russia have twice vetoed proposed UN sanctions over Assad's crackdown on a year long uprising in which more than 8,000 people are believe to have died . Protest: An anti-regime activist during as demo in Idlib earlier this week . Wu Bingbing, an expert on Arabian issues at Peking University, agreed China would not back a buffer zone, saying it infringed on Syria's sovereignty. 'A balance must be achieved between promoting the easing of the humanitarian crisis in Syria and ensuring Syria's sovereignty,' he said. Yesterday's developments came as the country was hit by more bloodshed, with intense clashes between government troops and rebels spilled across the border into Lebanon. Syrian troops did not physically cross the border, according to two Lebanese security officials. But bullets whizzed across the frontier into a rural, sparsely populated area around the Lebanese village of Qaa. A source said: 'There is no Syrian military presence on the Lebanese side of the border.' And this morning three government soldiers were killed in clashes with rebels in Homs province. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the clashes broke out when government forces tried to enter the town of Rastan. Fresh clashes in the Deir el-Zour province along the Iraqi border are also being reported.","Dictator goes walkabout in Baba Amr district of Homs .

"Experts have warned that hackers' plans to launch massive cyber-attacks on U.S. financial institutions are not just a possibility but a 'credible threat'. According to a report released by internet security firm McAfee, the impending attack on banks - dubbed 'Project Blitzkrieg' - could result in millions of dollars of losses. 'McAfee Labs believes that Project Blitzkrieg is a credible threat to the financial industry and appears to be moving forward as planned,' the company said in a report published yesterday. Victims: This map shows the locations of victims . of the Project Blitzkrieg pilot campaign whose infected computers are . reporting back to Romanian Control servers, according to McAfee Global . Threat Intelligence . It adds: 'Although Project Blitzkrieg hasn’t yet infected thousands of victims and we cannot directly confirm any cases of fraud, the attackers have managed to run an operation undetected for several months while infecting a few hundred.' The planned mass fraud campaign against 30 U.S. financial institutions set to occur next spring was announced in early September on a Russian-language hackers' forum, McAfee's report claims. The cybercriminal vorVzakone - whose name means 'thief in law' - claimed to be planning the release of a Trojan to allow him and accomplices to seize control of banks' computers to steal information and money. Although some analysts had doubted the veracity of vorVzakone's threats, McAfee believes they are authentic and said it believes it has managed to track down the servers the hacker used in pilot testing the malware. Fraud: This map shows the location of the Trojan's control servers, mainly situated in Eastern Europe . Breakdown based on target URLs: McAfee's research indicates that, rather than being a sweeping attack, the campaign will selectively target the financial industry . A Trojan horse, or Trojan, is a malicious application that masquerades as a legitimate file or helpful program but whose real purpose is, for example, to grant a hacker unauthorized access to a computer. Trojans do not attempt to inject themselves into other files like a computer virus, instead they may steal information, or harm their host computer systems. Trojans may use drive-by downloads or install via online games or internet-driven applications in order to reach target computers. The term is derived from the Trojan Horse story in Greek mythology because Trojan horses masquerade as harmless, useful gifts, in order to persuade victims to install them on their computers. Their report says that this enabled them to identify the variant of the Trojan being used, and that their research has shown that vorVzakone has already hit 500 victims. Part of the hacker's announcement included calling for accomplices to join him in Project Blitzkrieg, with him supplying the Trojan software and supporting infrastructure to those taking part. 'He also continues to confirm several other members of the underground who have stolen money already via this Trojan, citing its success to counter arguments against the buy-in he requires,' McAfee's report says. McAfee's research indicates that, rather than being a sweeping attack, the campaign will selectively target the financial industry, including computer networks at investment banks, consumer banks and credit unions. This will allow the attackers to 'stay under the radar' and is essential if they hope to succeed in stealing several million dollars over the course of the project. 'A limited number of infections reduces the malware’s footprint and makes it hard for network defenses to detect its activities,' McAfee says.","McAfee's warns of threat that surfaced on Russian hackers' forum .

"Enduring an uncomfortable flight can often make or break a holiday. But for some travellers, an unpleasant journey can often start long before the plane takes off. Travel website sleepinginairports.net has unveiled its annual list of the world's worst airports, with one being likened to 'a prison' and another being labelled a 'human sauna'. Scroll down for video . The 2014 Guide to Sleeping at Airports named Islamabad Benazir Bhutto International Airport as world's worst . And there are some surprising entries in the top 10 list, from New York's LaGuardia to Paris Beauvais-Tille airport. Paris' Beauvais-Tille International Airport was voted in sixth place, and described as 'cramped, rundown, debatably clean, and not particularly friendly, this airport does little more than load and unload passengers in a cargo-like fashion'. Once likened to a 'third world country' by US Vice-President Joe Biden, LaGuardia International Airport was voted into 10th place. Travellers repeatedly take issue with the long security lines, drab décor, poor restaurant selection, lackluster cleanliness and notoriously unhelpful staff. The 2014 Guide to Sleeping at Airports named Islamabad Benazir Bhutto International Airport the very worst after tourists were asked to rate their airport experiences based on comfort, facilities, cleanliness and customer service. Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport came in at fourth place after three consecutive years on the top spot, mainly because of overcrowding and air conditioning problems. No UK airports appeared in the global top 10, but Luton did make an appearance on the list of worst European airports, coming in eighth place. Saudi Arabia's Jeddah King Abdulaziz International Airport came second on the list, with travellers blaming the lack of services, rude immigration officers, lengthy queues and uncomfortable metal chairs . The survey asked travellers to rate their overall airport experiences between September 2013 and August 2014. One customer likened Pakistan's Islamabad Benazir Bhutto International Airport to 'a central prison' adding: 'Many of the touts and taxi drivers loot people at the airport and outside'. Tourists also criticised the absence of crowd control, 'pervasive corruption', inconsistent security checks and the overall lack of cleanliness and technology. Saudi Arabia's Jeddah King Abdulaziz International Airport came second on the list, with travellers blaming the lack of services, rude immigration officers, lengthy queues and uncomfortable metal chairs. Nepal's Kathmandu Tribhuvan International Airport was voted third in the annual survey, and was described as 'a bus station in an impoverished neighbourhood' Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport came in at fourth place after three consecutive years on the top spot, mainly because of overcrowding and air conditioning problems . Uzbekistan's Tashkent International Airport was fifth on the list, with poor crowd control the main grievance . Nepal's Kathmandu Tribhuvan International Airport was voted third in the annual survey, and was described as 'a bus station in an impoverished neighbourhood'. The lack of cleanliness was a again particular concern, as was the lack of soap, air-conditioning and filthy smoking room. After three years at the top of the worst airport lists, Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport saw a slight improvement after coming fourth on the list following refurbishment works. However, customers still took exception to overcrowding, lengthy queues, limited seating, unfriendly immigration officers and smelly toilets, with travellers complaining that Terminal 1 had become Asia's 'largest public sauna' when the air­conditioning broke down in April. Paris' Beauvais-Tille International Airport was voted in sixth place, and described as 'cramped, rundown, debatably clean, and not particularly friendly . In seventh place was Frankfurt's Hahn International Airport. Comfort levels were criticised and the atmosphere was labelled 'bleak, bare-boned and not especially welcoming' Italy's Bergamo Orio al Serio International Airport was given a withering verdict after coming in eighth place, with one travellers writing: 'The only way this airport could be improved would be to destroy it and rebuild' Uzbekistan's Tashkent International Airport was fifth on the list, with poor crowd control the main grievance. One traveller remarked: 'The person behind you will be trying to cut in front by subtly ramming their baggage cart into the back of your legs. Hold your ground!' Another added: 'Elbows are required should you hope to maintain your spot in line, since any form of line-up or crowd control seems to be virtually non-existent.'

"You can't afford a trip to the seaside in the hot summer weather - so you make your own swimming pool at home. That's what these Russian teenagers did yesterday, creating a fully-functioning water park in the living room of their flat in the city of Oryol. With temperatures reaching an uncomfortable 34C outside, the boys used only 'polyethylene film and tape' to transform their carpeted lounge into a swimming pool several feet deep. Scroll down for video . Young and reckless: The Russian teenagers built a fully-functioning swimming pool in the living room of their flat in Moscow. Quite how they planned to remove the water out of the building remains unknown . Cooling off: With temperatures reaching an uncomfortable 36C outside, the unnamed boys used only 'polyethylene film and tape' to transform their carpeted lounge into a swimming pool several feet deep . Taking a dip: They are seeing swimming together, posing with their thumbs up and diving beneath the water, while a thin layer of film covers their furniture and radiators . The images of the boys went viral after being posted on various Russian-language social media websites last night. They are seeing swimming together, posing with their thumbs up and diving beneath the water, while a thin layer of film covers their furniture and radiators. As well as posts congratulating the boys' creative way of keeping cool in the summer heat, there were others who branded them 'idiots'. 'The water is about half a metre high, . which means it is about half a ton for every square metre. I wonder if . their neighbours will gather altogether to give them a good lesson?,' one said. 'I hope the electric plugs are way above the water level,' another added, while a third person said: 'I hope they cut their nails really well before going inside...what if they break the film.' Indoor pool: The images of the boys went viral after being posted on various Russian-language social media websites last night . Mixed responce: As well as social media posts congratulating the boys' creative way of keeping cool in the summer heat, there were others who branded them 'idiots' Feeling the strain: One person posting on Russian social media about the images said: 'The water is about half a metre high, which means it is about half a ton for every square metre' Under water: It is not immediately clear if the boy's had permission from the property owner to build the makeshift swimming pool, but given the risk of serious damage, it seems highly unlikely . As well as the potential risk of the ultra-thin polyethylene film splitting or the floor giving way under the weight, another potential sticking point was how the boys are going to get rid of the water. Such a large amount of liquid would normally require a pump to remove and it seems unlikely the teenagers would have ready access to such heavy-duty equipment. It is not immediately clear if the boy's had permission from the property owner to build the makeshift swimming pool, but given the risk of serious damage, it seems highly unlikely. That may be reason why, despite being happy to pose for photographs, the boys have refused to reveal their names or the exact location of the flat. Perhaps in an attempt to persuade their own children not to pull such a reckless move, one of the most popular responses to the images on Russian social media websites so far is the simple phrase: 'Please, no one else try this at home.'","Russian boys came up with creative way of keeping cool as weather hit 34C .

"These are the first pictures inside Heathrow's new £2.5 billion Terminal Two, released as bosses at the UK's biggest airport announced it will open in exactly one year's time. Replacing the old terminal demolished in 2009, the privately-funded terminal T2 will eventually serve 20million passengers a year. The impressive pictures come as Heathrow bosses today promised to learn from the lessons of the Terminal 5 (T5) opening in 2008, which proved to be a disaster. Everybody get to work! Workers gather together in the departures hall of Heathrow's Terminal 2 for a talk by Developing Director John Holland-Kaye during an event marking One Year to Go until it re-opens . Lots left to do: Replacing the old terminal demolished in 2009, the privately-funded terminal T2 will eventually serve 20million passengers a year, served by some 25,000 staff and 20 international airlines . An artist's impression shows how the finished terminal building will look from the outside: Check-in will be large enough to handle 3,000 passengers an hour, with more than 50 shops, as well as 17 bars and restaurants . In that fiasco, thousands of bags were sent astray while passengers faced long queues after problems delayed staff from getting to work. Home to 25,000 staff, T2 is part of an overall project that includes not only the terminal building but also a 1,712ft satellite pier, a 1,340-space car park, an energy centre and a cooling station. The first flight will land at 5.55am on the terminal's first day and this will be operated by American carrier United Airlines, one of more than 20 airlines, including Virgin Atlantic, that will be using T2. Six years on from the T5 debacle, T2 will open in phases beginning from June 4, 2014, with airlines moving in over a period of six months. Just 10 per cent of flights will operate for the first three weeks of June 2014 before gradually building up to full operations. Also there will be six months of testing of T2, involving 14,000 people, before the opening. By the time of the first flight, the new terminal will have supported 35,000 jobs across the UK. Check-in will be large enough to accommodate 3,000 passengers an hour and an average of 55,000 passengers will arrive and depart a day. There will be more than 50 shops, as well as 17 bars and restaurants. 'I would not underestimate the challenge we face': Heathrow Developing Director John Holland-Kaye, pictured on stage, said he couldn't promise that 'everything will be perfect on day one', but said many lessons had been learned from the fiasco at the opening of T5 . Jobs: There will be six months of testing of T2, involving 14,000 people, before the opening. By the time of the first flight, the new terminal will have supported 35,000 jobs across the UK . Speech: Lord Deighton, Commercial Secretary to the Treasury, said T2 was an example of the kind of private sector investment in infrastructure that the Government believes will lift the country out of recession . Heathrow chiefs said they had worked hard to learn lessons from the T5 debacle but warned there would still be 'challenges' in getting T2 up and running. Speaking before hundreds of hard-hatted builders at the T2 site today, Heathrow development director John Holland-Kaye, said: 'We cannot promise that everything will be perfect on day one but we have a lot more experience now having opened T5. 'But I would not underestimate the challenge we face.' Chaos: People queue at check-in desks in the new Terminal 5 building in March 2008 after its new baggage handling system was suspended and dozens of flights were cancelled . Long delays: Thousands of bags were sent astray thanks to problems with the new terminal while passengers faced long queues after problems delayed staff from getting to work . Commercial Secretary to the Treasury Lord Deighton said today: 'Infrastructure is quite rightly at the heart of Government plans. 'We're investing more, cutting red tape and improving Government capability to deliver major infrastructure projects. 'But the vast majority of investment and delivery capacity lies in the private sector with projects such as T2, which forms part of the Government's Top 40 priority infrastructure investments.' Under construction: Work underway on Terminal 2, which will open in phases from June 4, 2014 . Outdated: The new T2 will replace the old Terminal 2 which was demolished in 2009 . Mr Holland-Kaye added: 'The new T2 has been designed around the needs of our passengers, to allow them to get to and from their flights as quickly as possible. 'Like T5, it will promise world-class customer service and a warm welcome to Britain, which visitors expect from the UK's hub airport. 'This next step in Heathrow's transformation will deliver a better journey for passengers, a more efficient and reliable infrastructure for airlines and additional jobs, trade and economic growth for the UK.'","Heathrow's new Terminal 2 is set to open in exactly one year's time .

"Nasa is planning an audacious mission to catch an asteroid in a giant, draw-string bag and tow it to the Moon - close enough for human explorers to visit. The U.S. space agency is set to ask Congress for $100million in its next budget request to start planning the project, which could be the next target for human spaceflight. The mission, first suggested last year by space experts at the California Institute of Technology, would aim to pluck a 500-ton asteroid from its orbit using an unmanned spacecraft, then haul it into orbit near the Moon. How to catch an asteroid: This graphic shows how . the projected asteroid-catching spacecraft might look. The 18-ton probe . would catch a 500-ton space rock in a giant, draw-string bag . Projected to cost $2.65billion in . total and last ten years, the project is said to have found favour with . President Obama's administration, which has already announced a goal of sending . astronauts to a near-Earth asteroid by 2025. Researchers from CalTech's Keck Institute for Space Studies (KISS) detailed the plan in a paper published last spring, but rumours of Nasa's decision to ask for funding for the project were reported by Aviation Week last week. 'The idea of exploiting the natural resources of asteroids dates back over a hundred years, but only now has the technology become available to make this idea a reality,' the report says. The KISS feasibility study suggests that bringing a 500-ton asteroid closer to Earth would give astronaut crews a 'unique, meaningful and affordable' destination for the next decade. It adds: 'Placing an NEA [Near Earth Asteroid] in lunar orbit would provide a new capability for human exploration not seen since Apollo. Such an achievement has the potential to inspire a nation. 'It would be mankind’s first attempt at modifying the heavens to enable the permanent settlement of humans in space.' Schematic: Researchers from CalTech's Keck . Institute for Space Studies (KISS) detailed the plan in a paper . published last spring, but Nasa is now reportedly seeking funding to . execute it . The report outlines an entirely robotic mission to locate and capture a Near Earth Asteroid (NEA), with a diameter of about seven metres and a mass of around 500,000kg. It is hoped such a modestly sized space rock may contain up to 100 tons of water, 100 tons of carbon rich compounds, 90 tons of metals and 200 tons of silicates. An 18-ton probe would be launched on an Atlas V rocket and use the Moon's gravity to slingshot itself towards its target in interplanetary space. Once there, the spacecraft would deploy a massive inflatable bag to envelop the asteroid - manoeuvring to stabilise against any tumble or rotation - then 'multiple ""draw strings"" would cinch-close the opening of the bag and also cinch-tight against the bulk material,' the report says. It adds: 'Due to the residual velocity between the asteroid and the spacecraft, there would be some “impact” as the asteroid is captured. 'Although, since the asteroid would be much more massive than the spacecraft, it is perhaps better to think of this as the asteroid capturing the spacecraft. 'Nevertheless, once the spacecraft and asteroid are tightly secured together, the spacecraft could then de-tumble the combination.' The proposed timeline for capturing the . asteroid: Projected to cost $2.65billion in total and last ten years, . the project is said to have found favour with the Obama administration . An ion thruster is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft that creates thrust by accelerating ions. Ion thrusters use beams of ions (electrically charged atoms or molecules) to create thrust in accordance with momentum conservation. They create very small levels of thrust compared to conventional chemical rockets but achieve very high specific impulse, or propellant mass efficiencies, by accelerating their exhausts to very high speed. However, ion thrusters carry a fundamental price: the power imparted to the exhaust increases with the square of its velocity while the thrust increases only linearly. Normal chemical rockets, on the other hand, can provide very high thrust but are limited in total impulse by the small amount of energy that can be stored chemically in the propellants. Due to their relatively high power needs and the requirement of an environment void of other ionized particles ion thrust propulsion is currently only practical in space. Moving such a huge object using conventional rockets would need an enormous amount of fuel to be carried along with the probe. So rather than using chemical rockets it would be equipped with a solar powered electric propulsion system. Such 'ion thrusters', as they are known, work by using electricity generated by solar panels to accelerate charged particles away from the space craft, ars technica explains. Using these, the spacecraft could begin its long track back to the Moon, estimated to take between two and six years. The revelation that Nasa wants money to begin planning a mission to capture an asteroid from interplanetary space comes three months after Major-General James Bolden made a cryptic suggestion to a National Research Council committee on human space flight. 'When the President announced that an asteroid would be the next destination for Nasa's human spaceflight programme, he did not say Nasa had to fly all the way to an asteroid,' he said. 'What matters is the ability to put humans on an asteroid.'","U.S. space agency reportedly set to ask for $100million to begin the project .

"Anger: Susan Rice, US Ambassador to the UN, walked out of a security council meeting after Russia and China vetoed a resolution on Syria . America's ambassador to the U.N. stormed out of a security council meeting after China and Russia vetoed a resolution condemning Syria's crackdown on anti-government protests. Furious Susan Rice claimed Washington was 'outraged' by opposition to the resolution describing it as a 'cheap ruse by those who would rather sell arms to the Syrian regime than stand with the Syrian people'. Over 2,700 people have been killed in . Syria in the six months since the uprising against President Bashar . al-Assad's regime began. Ms Rice said: 'The United States is outraged that this council has utterly failed to address an urgent moral challenge and a growing threat to regional peace and security. 'Today the courageous people of Syria can now see who on this council supports their yearning for liberty and universal human rights and who does not.' The resolution had been carefully drafted by France with the co-operation of Britain, Germany and Portugal. The wording had been changed three times in an attempt to make it more palatable to Moscow and Beijing with a reference to sanctions against Damascus being dropped. Vetoed: Security Council members vote on the resolution calling for an immediate halt to the Syrian government's crackdown on protests . Nine members of the 15-strong council backed the vote held late Tuesday while four more abstained. However Russia and China came out opposed the draft arguing it could be used to justify Nato-led Libya-style military action in Syria. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad blames the continuing unrest on armed gangs . It was the first double veto by Russia and China since July 2008 when they blocked proposed sanctions against Zimbabwe. In January 2007, they also vetoed a resolution calling on Burma to release all political prisoners, initiate a wide-ranging dialogue and end military attacks and human rights abuses. China's ambassador Li Baodong said his country was against interference in Syria's internal affairs, claiming the sanction could 'further complicate the situation'. The Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin . said it was 'unacceptable' to use the threat of sanctions against Syria . and claimed the draft was based on 'the philosophy of confrontation'. He also cited Nato's intervention in . Libya and suggested the Opposition movement in Syria was to blame for . the troubles saying they should refrain from using violence and distance . themselves from extremist elements. However Mr Churkin added that Moscow hoped Bashar al-Assad's regime would be 'quicker with implementing the promised changes.' Both Russia and China accuse Nato of using a similar resolution authorising the use of force to protect civilians in Libya as an excuse to topple Col Gaddafi's regime. The inability to agree on a suitable . course of action for Syria has led to growing frustration and the . emergence of divisions with in the Security council. Britain's UN Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said the veto 'will be a great disappointment to the people of Syria and the wider region that some members of this council could not show their support for their struggle for basic human rights.' Dissent: Protesters hold up a banner reading 'The Syrian people are one'  during a demonstration against the regime in Homs province on Monday . He added: 'By blocking this . resolution, the onus is now on those countries to step up their efforts . and persuade the Syrian government to end the violence and pursue . genuine reform.' Six months since the troubles began . President Bashar al-Assad insists his government is in the process of . introducing reforms, blaming the continued unrest on armed gangs. His envoy Bashar Jaafari, said Syria was 'astounded' by the council's efforts to 'undermine stability, security and co-existence' in the Middle East. Ms Rice walked out in protest when Mr Bashar claimed Israel could be seen as 'partaking in a genocide' and that  said the US was using its veto power to protect its ally.","Washington 'outraged' at 'cheap ruse'

"The two leaders of the Scottish National Party want to break up the Union because they have no children and do not understand families, it has been claimed. Former Scottish rugby players said Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon do not have to worry about future generations of Scots as they are childless. At a pro-union campaign event outside Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh, Steve Munro, who earned 10 caps for Scotland, said the pair ‘don’t have any understanding of kids as they don’t have children’. Scroll down for video . Alex Salmond has no understanding of the needs of future generations as he does not have children, it has been claimed. The First Minister of Scotland spoke with a mother and daughter in Aberdeen yesterday . The 56-year-old former winger added: ‘I’ve got children and I’m thinking about their futures. Salmond and Sturgeon have re-established divisions in our country.’ Andy Irvine, 62, a former president of the Scottish Rugby Union who earned 51 Scottish caps, added: ‘I’m a parent of four children and four grandchildren. ‘I may be coming towards the end of my life, but they’re starting theirs and they’d be better in the Union. ‘I’m a proud Scot and a proud Brit too. I have to think about the impact on their livelihoods.’ Mr Salmond’s wife Moira is 17 years his senior. The 59-year-old met her when she was his boss at the Scottish Office in the 1970s. They were married in 1981 and have no children. Neither of the two SNP leaders has children. They were yesterday accused of re-establishing divisions by former Scottish rugby players . Miss Sturgeon, 44, who is also childless, married Peter Murrell, chief executive of the SNP, in 2010. Other members of the SNP leadership who do have children include finance minister John Swinney, who has three. Women have consistently shown a lack of enthusiasm for Scottish independence in opinion polls, with men more likely to back a Yes vote. Commentators have claimed that Mr Salmond has a problem appealing to women as he is seen as too aggressive. Both the Yes and No campaigns have tried to use the subject of family to win over voters. The pro-union Better Together campaign urged people to vote against breaking up the UK if they love their family. Their posters have carried slogans including: ‘We love our kids, we’re saying no thanks’, ‘I love my family, I’m saying no thanks’ and ‘I love Scotland, I’m saying no thanks’. Yes Scotland has used a poster showing two young children with the words: ‘With Scotland’s wealth they’re heading for a better future’. At yesterday’s rally, former Scottish rugby international Andy Nicol said the players had become involved in the campaign because of Mr Salmond’s suggestion that patriotic Scots would vote Yes. He said: ‘He crossed the line with the insinuation that you can only be a patriotic Scot by voting Yes. Alex Salmond was very divisive with what he said about Team Scotland.’ Mr Nicol said there were ‘many unknowns’ in the nationalists’ plan for independence, including whether it could mean a change to the British and Irish Lions team. All the lads agreed they'd punched plenty of Englishmen in their time: QUENTIN LETTS sees Murrayfield's giants muscle in . Some of Scotland’s finest former rugby brawn gave the referendum No vote a punt upfield yesterday morning. The venue was Murrayfield Stadium, scene of many a slaughter of England hopes in the past. Through the September mist emerged 18 blokes, thickset, a couple tall enough to change the bulbs in a lamp-post. When they crouched for a team photo, you could hear the knee joints creak. ‘I’ve spilt blood for my country,’ said former prop and Grand Slam captain David Sole. ‘The Yes campaign people seem to think they have exclusive rights to Scottish patriotism. 'It can be intimidating to declare which side of the fence you sit on but we make a good team with the Union.’ Scottish rugby legends gathered at Murrayfield today to pledge their support of the Better Together campaign . Mr Sole, 52, said he had no wish ever to go into politics. Good grief, no. He had organised this event with Kenny Logan (70 caps) and Gavin Hastings (61 caps in a blue and occasionally blood-spattered jersey as fullback). They did it by themselves and told the No strategists they could make what they wanted of it. This was the voice of the rugby clubhouse speaking, plain as that – though the Scottish Rugby Union is having to maintain an impartial stance. ‘We could do with fewer politicians,’ said Steve Munro, who played on the (right) wing for Scotland in the early 1980s. Alluding to the SNP’s leader and his deputy, Mr Munro added: ‘The trouble with Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon is they don’t have kids so they don’t understand parents’ fears about the next generation. 'The nationalists have established divisions in our country. If you walk down Ayr High Street wearing a No badge, things can get pretty aggressive.’ It is hard to imagine any ‘aye’ types in Ayr wanting to get itchy with 17-stone, 6ft 6in Doddie Weir, who at the age of 44 still has the Buzz Lightyear jaw and corrugated nose of a man who has witnessed a few haymakers at the bottom of a ruck. He posed alongside the likes of Roger Baird, Jim and Finlay Calder and Scott Hastings. Former winger Iwan Tukalo said it was ‘easy for the Yes vote to play the emotional card but there is more to this debate than just the Saltire’. Doddie Weir said walking down the street in Ayr wearing a No badge could be difficult. Somehow its hard to imagine the Aye types wanting to get itchy wit 6ft 6in Doddie, pictured handing off an opponent . Euan Kennedy asserted gravely that he was a ‘passionate Scotsman’ and had answered the call to do this photocall in ‘the blink of an eye’ because he felt so strongly about the Union. An older chap introduced himself as John Douglas, who played No 8 for Scotland in the early 1960s. ‘I was three inches taller in those days,’ he said. The lads agreed happily that they had punched plenty of Englishmen in their time, but after a game they would all have friendly beers with the boys in white. Your sketchwriter fulfilled a boyhood dream and met Andy Irvine, Scotland’s star player in the 1970s. Now a 62-year-old property developer, he was still instantly recognisable as the fullback with the golden boot. ‘I genuinely believe in this cause,’ he said, eyes blazing. ‘I hope peace and harmony break out because it would be tragic for the wounds of this referendum to fester.’ Later, Ed Miliband walked a couple of hundred yards down Edinburgh’s Princes Street, popping into shopfronts to talk to employees. There was no trouble, though one frail, well-spoken socialist lady told him she was ‘very disappointed in him’. Octogenarian Isobel (she did not wish to vouchsafe her surname) told me she had already done a postal vote – for yes – but might have changed her mind if she had met Ed Mil earlier. ‘He’s too late,’ she said. At which point we all did an about-turn and trooped back in the other direction because a spin doctor had spotted that Mr Miliband was about to walk past an Ann Summers sex shop. If he had put his head in there to talk to the staff, his eyes might have popped out on sticks.","Leaders accused of not having to worry about future as they are childless .

"Scientists have long wondered if life really does exist on Mars. And a new set of pictures released by NASA could appear to confirm conspiracy theorists' claims that we are not alone in the universe. The images taken by a NASA navigation camera have been released and appear to show a human-like figure working on the Mars Curiosity Rover, which is scanning the Red Planet. Scroll down for video . One of the new pictures released by NASA of the Mars Curiosity Rover, which conspiracy theorists claim shows a human-like figure repairing the probe . The pictures seem to feature a human-shaped shadow looming over the probe as if they are repairing it. The shadow formed shows what looks like a male figure, who isn't wearing a helmet as his short spiky hair is visible. It also looks like the figure is wearing an air tank on his back and a suit covering most of his body. The pictures have been reported to the monitoring website UFO sightings daily, and have sent conspiracy theorists into overdrive, with some claiming it is proof life does exist on Mars. It comes after Gary McKinnon, an alleged computer hacker, who reportedly obtained classified documents from the U.S. government, claimed he found files showing the existence of 'extra-terrestrial officers'. It is claimed the pictures show a man, without a helmet is looming over the probe fixing it, wearing a full body suit and wearing an air tank on his back . However, others have claimed that the Curiosity Rover might not even be on Mars and that it has remained on Earth with humans cleaning it and performing maintenance. But some insist the shadow is just coincidence and that conspiracy theorists are only seeing the figure because it confirms their expectations and hopes. Nigel Watson, author of the UFO Investigations Manual, said: 'This underlines the fact that such things literally lurk in the shadows and play with our imagination.' It comes after it was announced in December that an instrument on the Curiosity Rover had identified spikes of methane that scientists believe may have come from bacteria-like organisms on the surface of Mars. The Mars Curiosity Rover, which is currently probing the Red Planet to try and determine if there has ever been any life forms there . The new discovery, reported in the journal Science, followed studies of gas samples by Curiosity's Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS) - an instrument that uses intense light to carry out chemical analysis. It revealed a low background level of methane, which spiked 10-fold over a period of just 60 Martian days. While there are non-biological explanations, experts suggested that its finding may be a sign of life on Mars. The Mars Curiosity Rover, is a probe designed to help with long-term exploration of the Red Planet. Its aim is to assess whether the planet has ever had an environment, which has been able to support small life forms and to determine whether the planet could be habitable.","New pictures have been released by NASA showing Mars Curiosity Rover .

"Checking that no one is looking, I step gingerly on to the grassy bank. I find my usual spot and put the paper bag with the bottle on the picnic table near by. My heart is pounding in gleeful expectation. On the hottest day of the year, this is the moment I’ve been waiting for. Any minute now I will feel the intoxicating rush of endorphins that every addict craves. I lie back, wait and — whoosh, there it is — the blast of heat as the sun’s rays burn into my skin. Scroll down for video . Sunbathing addict: Kate Mulvey, pictured soaking up the sun on holiday last year, loves the feeling of the sun's rays on her skin . For this is not a secret swig of vodka or an illicit line of cocaine, it is a sneaky hit of ultraviolet. I am a sunbathing addict, in the proper sense of the word. Although I know all about the dangers of sunbathing, I can’t stop exposing my body to the sun’s harmful rays. As an educated and normally rational woman, of course I am aware of the danger: deaths from the worst form of skin cancer have more than trebled over the past 40 years — melanoma kills 1,550 people in England and Wales each year, compared with only 400 a year in the Sixties. I know I am risking my life every time I peel off my clothes to roast myself on a foreign beach for hours on end. Can't stop, won't stop: Kate is still tanned despite the possibility of cancer . The evidence of the sun’s destructive effects are all too clear when I look in the mirror and see deep furrows across my forehead and crepey wrinkles in my decolletage. Yet still I can’t — won’t — stop. The truth is, I love sunbathing far too much to worry about the cancer risk. For me there is nothing more fulfilling than lying in my bikini on a sun lounger, drinking in that glorious warmth as the sun’s golden rays soak into my skin. The intoxicating smell of coconut oil and the sense of well-being are simply wonderful. Then there is the thrill of seeing bright white tan lines against your bronzed body. I feel instantly sexier and more glamorous as I slip into a summer dress and my confidence soars. Yes, worthier friends might nag me to stop, but I simply refuse to sit in the shade wearing Factor 50 and a dreadful hat. Now, at least, I have an excuse. Sunbathing is addictive. According to scientists at Harvard University in the U.S., lying in the sun produces an emotional effect similar to that of heroin. The sun’s rays stimulate production of endorphins, the ‘feel-good’ hormones that ease pain, and act on the body like opioid drugs. And, like those drugs, they are highly addictive. My obsession with ultraviolet light began in the late Seventies. I was 16 and everybody was at it. The fashion was for a deep mahogany tan, and my friends and I wanted to ape the glamorous celebrities who wafted around places like Portofino and St Tropez looking as if they had been dipped in molasses. Cheap foreign holidays had just begun to be popular and my family were able to swap our usual rainy week in Cornwall for the beaches of Southern Italy. Intoxicating: Kate loves nothing more than than lying in her bikini on a sun lounger . Suddenly we were plunged into a world where the temperature often reached 37c. I was hooked. My sisters and I would spend all day glued to our sunbeds. We would take a packed lunch to the beach and slather ourselves in delicious-smelling tanning unguents. It was so hot we would often lie in the sea, letting the waves cool us down. They say water reflects the sun’s rays onto the body, making you even browner, so that was perfect. One day a friend suggested that we could ‘speed up the process’ by applying olive oil. For the next few days we lay on the beach basting our nut-brown bodies and reeking of salad dressing. Bronzed and beautiful: Despite criticisms, Kate has always loved the feeling of being tanned . But in the evenings, when we walked down the streets flaunting our bronzed bodies and checking the admiring glances from local boys, it was worth it. There were times when my obsession with the sun backfired. Sometimes I returned from the beach lobster-red and in agony with sunburn. I’ve had sunstroke, too, once as a 17-year-old and twice in my supposedly wiser 20s. I would wake up with flu-like symptoms and be confined to my villa, drinking bottle after bottle of water and taking painkillers. Yet still I would be anxious to return to the beach. And it didn’t stop there. In the late Nineties, when the skin cancer scares began and everybody embraced the milk-bottle look, I carried on sunbathing with gusto. ""There were times when my obsession with . the sun backfired. Sometimes I returned from the beach lobster-red and . in agony with sunburn"" It was around this time that the term ‘tanorexia’ was first coined, to describe the shocking number of young people desperate to ape permanently bronzed celebrities such as Victoria Beckham and Katie Price. The fact that I was working on a beauty magazine and received daily press releases on the dangers of the sun did nothing to blunt  my enthusiasm. In summer, when everyone went to the local bistro for lunch, I would nip off to the town square, my bikini under my dress, to find a sunny spot and top up my tan. Then I started to crave sunbathing in the winter months. One freezing January in the late Nineties, I persuaded my then boyfriend to take me to Barbados. The minute I stepped out of the plane into sunshine, I felt so glad to be alive. To hell with the consequences: Kate sunbathes whenever possible . When he went off water-skiing, I planted myself on my sun lounger and didn’t move till sundown.Back home, if there was a party or I was feeling a bit down, I would book a few sunbed sessions so I felt attractive again. Even though I knew tanning beds aged the skin, I chose to ignore how dangerous they were. Wiser friends tried to talk sense into me, but it was like telling a 40-a-day smoker to give up there and then. I couldn’t. I have tried to go cold turkey a couple of times. Last year, as I approached 50 and started to worry about my wrinkles, I decided it was finally time to go pale. I was sick of people telling me that tans were no longer glamorous or sexy. ‘Look, Kate’s trying to be an extra out of TOWIE,’ a spiteful acquaintance shouted one evening at a posh art do, as I wafted in bronzed and wearing a short dress. Everyone laughed and the message was clear. I looked naff. I decided to avoid the sun altogether. That lasted just a week. I tried a salon spray-tan, too, but that didn’t do the trick, either. It left brown marks on a friend’s sofa, blotched and disappeared in a couple of days. My skin was a bright shade of tangerine — and it didn’t feel anything like as good as soaking up the sun. So now I sunbathe whenever possible. To hell with the consequences. And as soon as summer is over, I start counting the days until my winter holiday. Then, when I come back, I book another holiday straight away, just to keep me going. Having a tan makes me feel good about myself. I don’t smoke or drink. I eat brown rice and chia seeds. I sleep for eight hours a night and do a lot of exercise. So what if I sunbathe? I enjoy it. So as soon as the mercury rises again, you can bet your bottom dollar I will be at the lido with all the other addicts, breathing in the smell of suntan cream.","Kay Mulvey is a sunbathing addict in every sense of the word .

"Google has signed a 60-year lease for part of a historic Navy air base, where it plans to renovate three massive hangars and use them for projects involving aviation, space exploration and robotics. The tech giant has agreed to pay $1.16 billion in rent over the next six decades for the property, which also includes a working air field, golf course and other buildings.

The tech giant has agreed to pay $1.16 billion in rent over the next six decades for the property . Google also plans to invest more than $200 million (£126 million) to refurbish the hangars, and add other improvements, including a museum or educational facility that will showcase the history of Moffett and Silicon Valley. In an official statement, Nasa said a Google subsidiary called Planetary Ventures will use the hangars for 'research, development, assembly and testing in the areas of space exploration, aviation, rover/robotics and other emerging technologies.'

Google-owned firm Boston Dynamics has unveiled the latest tricks its Atlas robot can perform. Dubbed Ian, the robot is a formidable figure at 6ft 2in (1.8 metres) tall and weighs in at 330lb (149kg). It boasts 28 hydraulically actuated joints and stereo vision, and is one of the most advanced robots ever created. Roboticists at the firm have programmed the robot to perform the iconic 'crane kick' pose from the Karate Kid films. At the US Government's recent Robo-Olympics, Ian came second, despite competing as a virtual software simulation. Despite his lack of limbs, the world's most innocuously named 'bot was able to walk, carry a fire hose and, most impressively, get in a car and drive it. 'To achieve this level of maneuverability in robots, researchers at IHMC look toward nature,' the team said. 'Inspired by the speed of cheetahs, the endurance of horses, the maneuverability of monkeys, and the versatility of humans, IHMC researchers are on a quest to develop legged robots that are fast, efficient, and graceful, with the mobility required to access many of the same places that humans can.' Atlas is powered from an off-board, electric power supply via a flexible tether - although a new version promises to remove this. But a Google spokesperson declined to discuss specific plans for the property, which is located just a few miles from the company's main campus in Mountain View. Nasa plans to continue operating its Ames Research Centre on the former Navy site, while Google will take over operations at the runways and hangars. This includes a structure that was built to house dirigible-style Navy airships in the 1930s. Nasa added that the deal will save it $6.3 million (£3.9 million) in annual maintenance and operation costs. Google has already leased 42 acres of land at the airfield to build offices and the hangar may form part of these plans.

"A 15-year-old accused of stabbing her 12-year-old brother and attempting to stab her younger sister as part of a plot to kill her family and run away with her 23-year-old boyfriend appeared in court in Detroit on Thursday. Roksana Sikorski has had her bail set at $1 million and has been charged as an adult with four counts of conspiracy to commit murder and one count of assault after putting in action her plot, encouraged by boyfriend, Michael Rivera. The 'truly haunting' attack began at 2am last Friday at the family's Detroit home when Sikorski attacked her younger sibling's first and then allegedly planned to kill her parents while Rivera sat outside in his car giving instructions via text. Charged: Roksana Sikorski and Michael Rivera both face charges of conspiracy to murder after Sikorski attacked her family at their Detroit home early on Friday morning . Rivera, who wore a red jumpsuit in court, faces the same charges as well as a felonious assault charge. He was ordered held on $1 million bond Sunday. The girl's parents said she and Rivera were in a sexual relationship. The Detroit prosecutor's office said that after Sikorski stabbed her brother in the throat his screams alerted her parents, who rushed to his aid. He was taken to the Mott Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor and is expected to recover after surgery. Sikorski and Rivera fled the scene and police found them at a home in Detroit's southwest side and took them into custody at 8am on Friday morning. Concerned: Sikorski's parents Laurene and Jeff believe their daughter was heavily influence by Rivera and told the court in Detroit as much . 'He was using her to do his dirty work. She was under this man's spell,' the girl's mother told reporters after the hearing. The parents said the girl met Rivera earlier this year through social media. They said they first learned about the relationship after their daughter ran away from home this summer. 'I think it was a big secret. I didn't know about him,' her mother said. According to ClickDetroit, Sikorski's parents, Laurene and Jeff, told the court they have a 'strong bond' with their daughter and want to be there for her through these 'difficult times. 'I think she just thought this guy loved her and she wanted to do whatever he told her, and she was very vulnerable and she has a mental disorder and she needs help,' said Laurene Sikorski. 'I want to make sure she gets help.' Shocked: Sikorski appeared dazed and confused in the courtroom and is being held on $1 million bail . The couple said they adopted the girl and her two younger siblings from Poland when she was 4½ years old. They said she had been receiving treatment for depression and ADHD. 'She's never been violent in the past. We had no clue this was going to happen,' her mother said. 'She's getting psychiatric counseling. She's on medications. We've done everything in our power to help her.' Defense attorney Leslie Posner told reporters that the girl and her siblings were physically abused in Poland, eventually removed from their home in that country and later adopted by the Michigan family. 'They came from a very, very, very bad background,' the lawyer said, referring to the abuse that allegedly came from the children's biological parents. 'They were locked in closets. They were beaten.' The parents in Michigan said they are supporting their daughter despite the charges. If released on bond, the judge said the girl can't have any contact with her siblings and must wear a GPS monitor. She made eye contact with her parents several times during the hearing. 'Your honor, we have a very strong bond with our daughter,' her mother said. Court records did not list a lawyer for Rivera on Thursday. Preliminary hearings for both him and the girl are scheduled for Oct. 31.","Roksana Sikorski set in motion her 'horrifying plan' on Friday .

"Elderly patients at an NHS hospital were left covered in faeces, injured themselves crawling on urine covered floors and were physically restrained with tables and chairs (File photo) The row over the NHS in Wales took a dramatic turn last night when two senior doctors were banned after a Mail on Sunday exposé of the cruel abuse of elderly patients. The pair have been put on ‘restricted duties’ and reported to the General Medical Council disciplinary body, which has the power to strike them off. In addition, two more nurses have been suspended following this newspaper’s investigation into Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl, North Wales. The moves follow last week’s disclosure about the way dementia patients, some of whom later died, were left covered in faeces, injured themselves crawling on urine- covered floors, and were physically restrained with tables and chairs. The details were in a confidential report, which also revealed how a secret tape recording showed the contempt of foul-mouthed staff, who swore about patients and tried to block complaints. Health chiefs were accused of failing to tackle one of the most shocking scandals in recent NHS history. Well-placed sources say this newspaper’s investigation caused ‘blind panic’ at the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB), which runs Glan Clwyd. The board was prompted to take emergency measures after protests by relatives of patients, including putting two senior doctors on ‘restricted duties’ and reporting them to the GMC, and suspending two more nurses accused of abusing patients. It brings the total number of Glan Clwyd doctors and nurses suspended or moved to other duties to a staggering 14. All are on full pay. The new sanctions come ten months after the Glan Clwyd scandal was first uncovered. Health chiefs closed the Tawel Fan dementia ward, suspended five nurses and moved five more to other duties. Following an independent inquiry completed earlier this month, BCUHB called in police – but refused to reveal the report’s findings. Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb last night added his voice to all-party calls for the report to be published. He brushed aside the claims of health chiefs that it could jeopardise the police investigation, pointing out that the staff and patients are not identified by name in the report. ‘I can’t see any good reason for withholding it,’ said Mr Crabb. ‘The families have a right to see it so they can come to terms with what’s happened to their loved ones. Given what’s been uncovered, I think it would be a healthy part of the process for them to be able to see it.’ Mr Crabb’s call to publish the report was backed by local Vale of Clwyd Labour MP Chris Ruane and Tory Welsh Assembly Member Darren Miller. Mr Crabb said he was ‘deeply troubled and saddened’ by the abuse revealed at Glan Clwyd. The scandal reinforced claims by David Cameron that the NHS in Wales, run by the Labour-controlled Welsh Assembly, was a ‘shambles’. ‘One of the reasons we need to sort this out is because I don’t want the NHS in Wales to be held up as an example of how not to do things,’ said Mr Crabb. The scandal centred on the Tawel Fan dementia ward of the Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl, North Wales . Health chiefs refused to say why the two senior Glan Clwyd doctors had been put on restricted duties. Such sanctions are usually used when they are considered a danger to patients. The BCUHB said the pair have been reported to the GMC, which has the power to strike off doctors. The suspended Tawel Fan nurses face sanctions from the Nursing and Midwifery Council, which has similar powers to the GMC. An NMC spokesman said: ‘When we receive a complaint about a nurse or midwife we investigate and we can take steps to prevent individuals from practising. ‘We take allegations of the abuse of patients extremely seriously and are in touch with BCUHB.’ Tina Donnelly, director of the Royal College of Nursing in Wales, said: ‘Any registered nurse has a duty to observe the highest professional standards to maintain their registration as a nurse. That requires them to be accountable 24 hours a day to ensure they are working in the patients’ interests.’ Most of the Glan Clwyd nurses are members of Unison. Donna Hutton, Unison regional organiser for North Wales, said: ‘We support the [police] investigation and expect our members to fully participate in it. The Ablett unit which houses the Tawel Fan ward has been shut and is now under police investigation . ‘We will deal with the outcome of the report with the employers once it is completed.’ However, one union organiser said nurses guilty of abuse can expect little sympathy, adding: ‘Unions are there to represent their members, not to defend the indefensible.’ The Mail on Sunday has been told of more distressing allegations of abuse by Glan Clwyd whistleblowers that were not covered in the independent report. One said: ‘I saw a 93-year-old lady with severe dementia take her underwear off in full view of others and in her state of extreme confusion was indulging in a sexual act. No member of staff was anywhere near. When a visitor brought it to their attention they came in and dragged her away roughly.’ Another source said: ‘I saw a man defecating in a flower pot in the ward garden and wiping his bottom with leaves. He was all alone and someone had to get the staff to come and look after him. That kind of thing was normal on Tawel Fan.’ One individual familiar with Tawel Fan said: ‘Several of the patients did not know when they where bumping into other people. It led to fights, but the staff were usually in their glass box watching TV. Visitors would call the rapid response unit to break up the fights.’ Detective Superintendent Jo Williams, of North Wales Police, said the independent report should not be published until the police inquiry was over. A BCUHB spokesman said: ‘We continue to take action to ensure all older people in our mental health services are safe and are properly looked after.’ Under new laws announced after the Mid-Staffordshire care scandal, doctors and nurses found guilty of ‘wilful neglect’ face a prison sentence of up to five years.","Two doctors on 'restricted duties' and reported to General Medical Council .

"One couple's romantic moment in the sea ended in agony when their genitals became stuck together. Two amorous Italians decided to take advantage of a sunny day on an almost-deserted beach by heading into the sea together. Unable to control themselves, they engaged in a passionate embrace, according to the Italian newspaper The Local. An Italian couple were hospitalised after becoming stuck together while having sex in the sea (file pic) But their lovemaking came to an embarrassing end when the man was unable to extract himself from the woman due to suction, it was reported. They were forced to remain in the water until they manage to flag down a woman walking past, who offered them a towel to cover their tangled bodies as they struggled back to shore. A doctor was called to the beach at Porto San Giorgio, Italy, but the case was so severe the couple were taken to the emergency room at a local hospital. There, the couple were set free after the woman was given an injection commonly used to dilate the uterus of pregnant women. It's thought that the couple may have suffered from the rare occurrence 'penis captivus' in which the muscles of the vagina clamp down on the penis much more firmly than usual. When the penis is in the vagina it becomes increasingly engorged,  Dr John Dean, a UK-based sexual physician, told the BBC. He said: 'The muscles of the woman's pelvic floor contract rhythmically at orgasm. While those muscles contract the penis becomes stuck and further engorged.' Finally the vaginal muscles relax, the blood flows out of the penis and the man can withdraw. The couple were taken to the emergency room of the hospital near the beach at Porto San Giorgio, Italy (pictured). The woman was freed after being given an injection  used to dilate the uterus of pregnant women . He said that over the years, several of his patients have discussed their experience of getting 'stuck'  - more out of curiosity than because it was a problem, he added. The news comes after this year a half-naked woman had to be rescued by firefighters from the bottom of a well after falling in while having sex near a Spanish park. The 21-year-old was making love with her partner when the cover of the waterwheel well shaft came loose, sending her plummeting 15m into the water below. But rather than trying to rescue his girlfriend, the man pulled up his trousers in a panic and fled the scene.","Italian couple's amorous moment in the sea turned to agony .

"Deborah Hargreaves, chair of High Pay Centre, said structures are still completely flawed . Bosses of the top 100 companies enjoyed just under £4.3million in pay and perks last year after an average pay rise of 10 per cent. A report shows how the leaders of FTSE 100 firms continued to enjoy salary hikes, while ordinary workers endure pay freezes or meagre increases. Campaigners said last night that the figures were further evidence of ‘completely flawed’ pay structures that reward company bosses for ‘being in the right place at the right time’. The average package handed to a chief executive of a FTSE 100 firm hit £4.25million in 2012, a rise of 10 per cent on the year. A rally in the stock market has led to huge windfalls for business leaders. This has driven a 40 per cent increase in the value of long-term shares bonuses issued in previous years, according to analysis from shareholder group Manifest and consultancy MM&K. The bumper windfalls also mean that even companies which have tried to show more restraint, by reducing cash bonuses, have still paid their chief executives more than the previous year. Deborah Hargreaves, chair of campaign group the High Pay Centre, said the fact business leaders’ overall pay packets had still increased showed ‘performance-related pay structures are completely flawed’. ‘They are too easy to reach, and reward business leaders for being in the right place at the right time rather than successful, sustainable management of their company,’ she said. Calling for a ‘major overhaul of executive pay’, she added: ‘Executives have seen their rewards racing ahead of the rest of the workforce. Pay for everyone else has been frozen or failed to keep up with inflation. This leads to a great sense of injustice in the workplace.’ By contrast, households across the country have seen the spending power of their earnings eroded by inflation, which fell to 2.4 per cent in April. Angela Ahrendts was the highest paid boss last year, scooping £16.9million in pay and perks . The average worker received a pay rise of just 1 per cent, according to the Office for National Statistics – the lowest since its records began in 2001. The average annual increase for the last decade was just 1.3 per cent. Angela Ahrendts, American chief executive of British fashion brand Burberry, was the highest paid boss last year, scooping £16.9million in pay and perks. While the top five highest paid bosses received around 18 per cent less in 2012 than the previous year, the remainder of the FTSE 100 bosses were handed an average 17 per cent increase in pay and perks. The Coalition’s plans to cut greed in the boardroom could see  shareholders given powers to block huge pay packages.","Leaders of FTSE 100 firms continued to enjoy salary hikes .

It was the first time he fired his gun in a career spanning nearly thirty years . The sergeant-at-arms is the person responsible for safety and security of parliament and has the ceremonial role of carrying a gold mace into the House of Commons. Ex-policeman Mr Vickers has held the position for eight years. MP Craig Scott wrote on Twitter: ‘MPs … owe their safety, even lives, to sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs’ caucus rooms.’ Minister Julian Fantino added that he was ‘profoundly grateful’ for Mr Vickers’ ‘selfless act.' In Parliament on Thursday the public servant was greeted with a moving standing ovation .

He would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can't stress that enough - but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.' Vickers released a statement Thursday afternoon. 'I am very touched by the attention directed at me following yesterday’s events. However, I have the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of Members, employees and visitors to the Hill,' he said.

"Reasons for people changing their accent included trying to sound more sophisticated during a job interview or while trying to chat someone up (file picture) It is ingrained in us in our formative years and becomes an intimate part of our identity. But it seems some of us are never satisfied with our accent. More than one in five Britons will change the way they talk from time to time, a study has shown. From trying to sound more sophisticated at a job interview to wanting to impress on a date, the motives are many and varied. Around 6 per cent have toned down their accent. But 5 per cent were proud enough of the way they spoke to have thickened it. In news that will come as no surprise to former England manager Steve McClaren, ridiculed for his affected Anglo-Dutch accent in a TV interview after a spell working in Holland, we often mimic the speech patterns of the people around us. Many of us will adopt a regional dialect when we move to a different area, and 4 per cent have even spoken English with a foreign accent. According to the survey, some people have been forced to change their regional accents to help people understand them. Just over 8 per cent of Britons have tried to make themselves sound more posh. And 4 per cent have tried to sound less posh – rising to 11 per cent in London. Brummies were most likely to tone down their accent – 16 per cent admitted to softening their tones. Only 2 per cent of Scots have changed the way they talk. Old Etonian Prime Minister David Cameron and even royalty have been accused of altering upper class accents. For many of the well-heeled in politics or entertainment, there is often a need to appear to be more of a 'man of the people'. Analysis of the Queen's Christmas speeches over the decades has shown her accent has become more 'estuary English', while Prime Minister David Cameron has been accused of altering his accent . While . analysis of the Queen's Christmas speeches over the decades has shown . her accent has become more 'estuary English' than before. Five per cent of those surveyed said they have overplayed their own natural accent and six per cent have softened it. Six per cent have tried using a different regional accent and four per cent have adopted a fake foreign one, said the survey. Those . most likely to reduce their natural accent are in the West Midlands . where 16 per cent admit they have had occasion to soften their . Birmingham tones. But only two per cent of Scottish people admit they have ever reduced their regional accent for the sake of others. Accents are not the only things Britons have faked, said the survey by artificial grass firm Trulawn. Two in three Brits have faked something from their tans to fur coats, it found. Trulawn director Ian Parry said: 'Some things are simply unachievable - a year long real tan, expensive designer clothes and a perfectly manicured lawn for example. 'But savvy Brits are realising you can have it all and achieve perfection in all areas of your life at a fraction of the time or cost and that's why the trend for faking it is booming. 'There's also been a shift in attitude compared to a few years ago as people are no longer ashamed to admit when something is not the real deal and are now celebrating all things artificial.'

"British archaeologists have unearthed a giant complex near the ancient city of Ur in southern Iraq. The area is believed to have been home to Abraham, father of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. As the find is 4,000 years old, roughly the same age as Abraham himself, it raises the tantalising possibility of a direct link with one of history's most significant religious figures. Dig: Archaeologists at work on a site in Iraq near the ancient city of Ur believed to be 4,000 years old . The large city was discovered by a team from the archaeology department of Manchester University, led by Stuart Campbell. The site is roughly the size of a football field, around 80 metres on each side. Complexes of that size from 2,000BC are extremely rare, according to Dr Campbell. One of the most extraordinary archaeological items discovered at the site is a clay plaque of a worshipper approaching a sacred site dressed in a flowing robe. Exquisite: This clay plaque from the site shows a worshipper in a flowing robe approaching a sacred place . Progress: This is the first time in three decades that British archaeologists have been able to work in Iraq . The dig is a rare example of good news stemming from the invasion of Iraq, as it is the first British excavation in the country for nearly 30 years. As Saddam Hussein was increasingly cut off from the international community it became more difficult for scholars to entry the country. And in the early years following the Western invasion of the country, conditions were far too unstable to allow archaeological work. Civilisation: This image of a ram is one of many exquisite objects found near Ur during previous excavations . The Mesopotamian culture of 4,000 years ago is already well known for creating the conditions for the first cities to thrive. Exquisite objects from the area include the Standard of Ur, a mosaic picture now in the British Museum. Abraham is said in the Book of Genesis to have been born in a city called Ur of the Chaldees before travelling towards the Holy Land. It is unclear whether or not this city should be identified with the Mesopotamian civilisation of Ur.","Team from University of Manchester discovers 4,000-year-old complex .

"Sadiq Khan, Labour's Shadow Justice Secretary, has received death threats after voting in favour of gay marriage . Britain's most senior Muslim MP has received death threats after voting in favour of gay marriage. Police have told Sadiq Khan, Labour’s Shadow Justice Secretary, that the threats are credible enough that he should review the security around him and his family following the Commons vote. Officers in his Tooting constituency in London have been put on high alert, and will respond ‘extra-quick’ should an incident be reported at his home. The Metropolitan Police has also advised Mr Khan, 42, that they may put more officers around him if further threats are made. He told one friend he was especially concerned about those close to him, saying: ‘My family do not need to suffer for what I have to do for my job. 'I’ve not had threats like this before.’ Mr Khan was among 400 MPs, five of them Muslim, who voted in favour of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill at the beginning of this month. It is believed Mr Khan, who was campaign manager for Ed Miliband’s successful leadership bid, has been singled out as he is the most prominent Muslim MP. Mr Khan – who became Britain’s first Muslim Minister to attend Cabinet in the last Government – has been condemned by British-based hardline clerics, who have accused him of ‘selling out’ his religion. Mufti Muhammed Aslam Naqshbandi Bandhalevi, who is the head imam of the Jamia Islamia Rizvia mosque in Bradford, has issued a fatwa, or ruling, declaring Mr Khan an ‘apostate’ from Islam and said he should ‘repent before Allah’. Some veiled threats against all the Muslim MPs who backed gay marriage are visible online. On the British-based extremist website Islamic Awakening, a member with the name Riaz77 posted about the vote: ‘And what is anybody going to do about this? Scream and shout it’s haram [unlawful] to vote, so end up letting kaafirs [infidels] and munafiqun [hypocrites] who vote Labour as usual re-electing them in 2015, combined with a lack of courage to defeat them with a bullet?’ Mufti Muhammed Aslam Naqshbandi Bandhalevi, head imam of the Jamia Islamia Rizvia mosque in Bradford, has issued a fatwa, or ruling, declaring Mr Khan an 'apostate' from Islam . Another website, called Izharudeen.com, warns: ‘Time  to account these apostate MPs, they changed something that Allah made haram to halal [lawful] by voting for gay marriages.’ Security sources have said that when extremists declare a fellow Muslim ‘apostate’, it is usually a way of legitimising violent attacks on them. But moderate Muslim groups have condemned the threats. Inayat Bunglawala, of Muslims4UK, said: ‘It is deeply worrying to see that Sadiq Khan has been subjected to these sinister threats. ‘He is a working-class Muslim from South London who has done well. ‘Instead of vilifying him as an apostate, his short-sighted and bigoted detractors would do better by looking to him as a talented and hard-working role model for young Muslims.’","Police have told Sadiq Khan he should review .

"Sylvia Day's Crossfire trilogy sells 1m copies in three months . Only J.K Rowling and Dan Brown have had better first week sales . It is graphic, more sexually explicit and has a handsome but dysfunctional male lead women are already swooning over. Readers looking for their next fix after 50 Shades of Grey are now reaching for Sylvia Day’s Crossfire trilogy. The books do not feature bondage or sadomasochism but the sex scenes are more frequent and graphic. American Author of the Crossfire series Sylvia Day is set for success with a million book sales in three months . Book one, entitled Bared to You, and book two, called Reflected in You, have sold more than one million copies, both print and e-editions, in the past three months. Print sales for Reflected in You topped in 82,000 in the first six days of release – only two other novels have had better opening week sales - JK Rowling's The Casual Vacancy, and Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol. Publisher Penguin said it would not give e-book figures for commercial reasons but that total sales for the two books combined was now in excess of one million. Fans admitted there are many similarities with EL James 50 Shades of Grey books but have hailed Day’s work as “better written”, “more exciting”, and “addictive” with hundreds giving rave reviews online. The story follows 24-year-old Eva Trammell who works in an advertising firm and her intense and passionate relationship with 28-year-old sexually magnetic billionaire. Fans have given the books rave reviews and say they are better written than the Fifty Shades of Grey collection . One fan wrote: ‘5 Highly Satisfied Stars. Sexy, sophisticated, intense and impossible to put down! In Bared To You, Sylvia Day has crafted a rousing tale of emotional and sexual obsession you will not want to miss, without a doubt! ‘The writing is superb, contemporary and truly gives all comparable books and series a run for their money! In my opinion, this easily comes out on top. Another said: ‘Move over Christian Grey, 'cause I'm totally smitten with Gideon Cross. This story was amazing. Brilliant. Engaging. Sexy. Edgy. Angsty. All things I love, all wrapped up in one dysfunctionally appealing package.’ In a recent interview with Socialite Life, Miss Day dismissed concerns her work was simply a replica of EL James’ work. Sylvia dismissed concerns her work was simply a replica of EL James' work . She said: ‘The 50 Shades series is a Cinderella story, where the characters seemingly have no flaws. The Crossfire series is very different in that these two characters are almost mirror images of each other. Eva and Gideon are both wealthy and have had that advantage. As they get to know each other they realize they have the same traumas in their past, which is both are sexual child abuse survivors. ‘So there’s a lot of baggage that comes into the relationship and they both cope with those traumas in totally different ways. The things she uses to thrive trigger him in negative ways and vice versa. The books have yet to rival the sales figures for the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy. The first erotic novel in the series has sold excess of 5.3 million copies with print and digital combined in the UK, making it the bestselling British book in the past decade. The second and third books in the trilogy, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, have sold around 3.6 million and 3.2 million copies respectively. JK Rowling's The Casual Vacancy, and Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol are the only two other novels to have better opening week sales . Publishers have hailed this the “year of the bonkbuster” as mummy porn takes over from chick-lit as the new must-read genre for women. Earlier this year, Shirley Conran’s classic Lace was re-released and Mills & Boon launched  new eBook erotica series under the banner Twelve Shades of Surrender. The £1.99 erotic short stories range features titles such as Going Down, about a young girl finding sexual freedom in Paris, Cuffing Kate, which lays bare fantasises about dominance and submission, and For Your Pleasure, about naughty neighbours. The company, famed for its romantic stories began publishing more hardcore erotica in 2008, with the Spice paperback series. The collection of novels are said to be even more erotic than Fifty Shades of Grey . But the boom in digital e-readers such as the Amazon’s Kindle, Sony’s Reader, and devices such as the iPad, means such content is more accessible anonymously, prompting them to release a new series. The revival of Shirley Conran’s Lace, three decades after it was first published and 15 years after it went out of print, is also a nod to the demand from women for books with sexual content designed for them. It was a huge hit in the 1980s despite the controversy surrounding its explicit content and was made into a mini-series for TV.","Sylvia Day's Crossfire trilogy sells 1m copies in three months .

"Right down to the thick-rimmed glasses, expressions and perfect comic timing, the likeness is uncanny. And if it weren’t for the fact that Morecambe and Wise are sadly no longer with us, these two men would surely pass for them every single time. Jonty Stephens and Ian Ashpitel have been given the daunting task of ‘resurrecting’ Britain’s best-loved comedy duo for this month’s Edinburgh Festival. Uncanny: Jonty Stephens (left) and Ian Ashpitel (right) not only look and sound identical to the duo, but their mannerisms and delivery are pitch perfect . The originals: The show at Edinburgh Festival aims to bring back the 'feel, look and sound' of an evening with Ernie Wise (left) and Eric Morecambe (right) Those who have seen them in action are astonished that they not only look and sound identical to the twosome, but their mannerisms and delivery are also spot on. Their show, Eric and Little Ern, re-enacts the finest moments during their 42-year partnership, which ended with Eric Morecambe’s death in 1984. It is set in 1999, when Ernie Wise is close to death in hospital after having two heart attacks while on holiday. While he dozes, a white-coated doctor walks in - and turns out to be none other than the spirit of his old pal Eric. Somehow, he manages to coax ‘little Ern’ off his sickbed and into a re-enactment of some of their finest showbiz moments. The show, written and performed by Stephens and Ashpitel, aims to bring to life the ‘feel, look and sound’ of an evening with Eric and Ernie. It combines much-loved sketches with additional original material by scriptwriters Eddie Braben, Sid Green and Dick Hills as well as some biographical details. Highlights: Morecambe and Wise cosy up to actress Penelope Keith. The show recreates their greatest comedy moments in a series of flashbacks from Ernie Wise's death bed . Chemistry: Their talent and affection for each other jumped off the screen, whether it was dressing up with Glenda Jackson (left) or acting the fool in the opening gambit to their show (right) Ashpitel and Stephens say their own friendship, spanning back several decades, helps them recreate the chemistry of that incomparable duo. They also suggest it helps that Ashpitel, who plays Wise, ‘just happens to have short, fat, hairy legs’. The pair first met at drama school 30 years ago and recently created this show from a shorter, after-dinner sketch they were already performing. Individually they have a wide variety of stage and television credits ranging from BBC drama to Shakespeare’s Globe.

He also got to ride in a fire engine and had an early birthday party. Yesterday scores of people, including his identical twin brother Liam and three older sisters,  walked behind his coffin. Others lined the streets of Denmead, Hampshire, as he was carried to his funeral at All Saints' church. Mrs Robinson paid tribute to her son, whose diagnosis in January inspired fundraising across their community and touched the hearts of celebrities. Passion: Jack loved Star Wars and even when her was ill in hospital he would play with toys and watch the films . Poignant: Traffic was stopped in the village as the funeral cortege slowly filed through Denmead on Thursday . A recording of her singing Ellie Goulding's How Long Will I Love You was played to around 60 mourners inside the church. Mrs Robinson, a post office supervisor, said: 'Jack liked the song and I used to sing it with him. 'I had 10 weeks to think about the funeral and I wanted to do something different and special for him. 'I wanted Jack's funeral to have a twist, because he was so unique. 'I went to a recording studio and decided on Ellie Goulding's song because that's my message and words to Jack. 'It seemed quite fitting, and although no one likes to hear the sound of their own voice, I wanted to do it for Jack. 'Jack always had that cheeky grin on his face.

"The mission to produce the world’s first 1,000mph (1,600km/h) car has been given a boost - or more accurately thrust - with the installation of a state-of-the-art jet engine. A team of five engineers spent eight hours fitting the EJ200 engine to the upper and lower chassis of the supersonic Bloodhound car. Driver Andy Green, 51, is hoping to break the world land speed record when he tests the £10 million rocket-powered vehicle next year. The mission to produce the world’s first 1,000mph (1,600km/h) car has been given a boost - or more accurately thrust - with the installation of a state-of-the-art jet engine. A team of five engineers spent eight hours fitting the EJ200 jet engine to the upper and lower chassis of the supersonic Bloodhound car (pictured) The engine, which is normally found powering a Eurofighter Typhoon, weighs a tonne and produces 20,000lbs (90kN) - or nine tonnes of thrust. It was fitted at the Bloodhound technical centre in Avonmouth, near Bristol. The upper chassis is made of strong, but lightweight aluminium, onto which titanium stringers and titanium skin will be fixed using glue and 1,400 aircraft specification rivets. The SSC stands for ‘SuperSonic Car’. The vehicle has four wheels and is powered by both the newly-fitted jet engine and a rocket. It is set to travel at 1,000mph (1,600km/h). The slender body, 44 feet (14 metres) long, keeps the entire vehicle aerodynamic. It weighs just over seven tonnes and the engines will produce more than 135,000 horsepower. That’s more than six times the power of all the cars on a Formula 1 starting grid put together. In the coming years the vehicle will begin test runs at lower speeds before attempting to set a new land speed record. The current land speed record stands at 763.035mph (1,227.985km/h), set by former RAF pilot Andy Green - who will also drive the Bloodhound - back in 1997 in the ThrustSSC. The Bloodhound will beat this record by some distance if it is successful. The lower chassis, below the jet, is made of aluminium and steel, and houses the Nammo hybrid rocket. The two power plants together produce 135,000 thrust horse power, or the equivalent to 180 Formula 1 cars. The pencil-shaped car will be 44ft (13.4m) long, 6ft (183cm) in diameter, and weigh 7.5 tonnes when completed. Chief engineer Mark Chapman said: ‘This is a fantastic moment in the project. ‘It’s great to see the jet engine fitted, it validates the many years of hard work by our team of motor sport and aerospace engineers.’ The project is on course for the finished car to roll out for low speed testing at up to 200mph (321km/h) at Newquay’s Aerohub next summer. The team will then head to South Africa and attempt to break the 1,000mph barrier on a purpose-built 12-mile track in the desert in 2015 and 2016. During the record-chasing run, Bloodhound will cover 12 miles (19km) in two minutes, exerting an acceleration force of almost 2G, and peak deceleration force of 3G on the driver. The current land speed record stands at 763.035mph (1,227.985km/h), set by former RAF pilot Andy Green - who will also drive the Bloodhound - back in 1997 in the ThrustSSC. The pencil-shaped car (concept pictured) will be 44ft (13.4m) long, 6ft (183cm) in diameter and weigh 7.5 tonnes when completed. The upper chassis is made of strong, but lightweight aluminium to which titanium stringers and titanium skin will be fixed using glue and 1,400 aircraft specification rivets . The lower chassis, below the jet (pictured), is made of aluminium and steel, and houses the Nammo hybrid rocket. The two power plants together produce 135,000 thrust horse power, or the equivalent to 180 F1 cars . Earlier this year, designers of the supersonic car revealed the vehicle’s futuristic cockpit. It has been made from five different types of carbon fibre weave, and two different resins. It has taken more than 10,000 hours to design and manufacture in total. The team behind the Bloodhound SSC also revealed how they intend to slow it from 1,000mph (1,600km/h) to zero. After the car reaches its top speed, air brakes and parachutes slow it to 160mph (260km/h). Breaking to this speed is done at a constant 3G deceleration - equivalent to going from 60mph (95km/h) in a normal car to zero in just one second - for 20 seconds. At this speed the cars wheels are still spinning 10,000 times per minute. Attempts to use carbon rotors from a jet fighter in the form of car-like disc brakes shattered at speeds of just half this, so the team needed a new approach. Instead, they switched to steel rotors. In tests, these could withstand temperatures of up to 850°C (1,560°F), and be used again. The next step will be to test these brakes out at the full 10,000rpm that will be experienced. Sandwiched between the layers of carbon fibre are three different thicknesses of aluminium honeycomb core, which provide additional strength. At its thickest point the material is made up of 13 layers, but measures just 0.9-inches (24mm) thick. The cockpit structure weighs 441lbs (200kg) and bolts directly to the metallic rear chassis carrying the jet, rocket and racing car engine. It has to be strong as this front section will have to endure peak aerodynamic loads of up to three tonnes per square metre at 1,000mph (1,609kph), as well the considerable forces generated by the front wheels and suspension. It will also carry ballistic armour to protect Wing Commander Green should a stone be thrown up by the front wheels at very high speeds. The cockpit is positioned in front of three loud motors - the jet, a cluster of hybrid rockets and the racing car engine that drives the rocket’s oxidiser pump, which are expected to generate a noise level estimated at 140 decibels - the equivalent to a shotgun blast. Wing Commander Green will wear a specially made in-ear communications system to protect his hearing and to ensure that he can communicate with mission control. The team behind the Bloodhound SSC also revealed how they intend to slow it from 1,000mph (1,600km/h) to zero.

Attempts to use carbon rotors from a jet fighter in the form of car-like disc brakes shattered at speeds of just half this, so the team needed a new approach. Instead, they switched to steel rotors from brake manufacturer AP Racing. In tests these proved much more promising, withstanding temperatures of up to 850°C (1,560°F). They even survived to such an extent that they can be used again. The next step will be to test these brakes out at the full 10,000rpm that will be experienced.

"Clare Balding has called for more female commentators in sport insisting it was the next ‘big breakthrough’ that needed to happen to achieve equality on television. The 41-year-old star was honoured at the Women in Film and Television Awards for her work as a presenter during the London 2012 Olympics. Miss Balding won the achievement of the year accolade for her work for the BBC and for Channel 4’s Paralympic Games coverage. Woman winner: Clare Balding with Mark Foster after winning the achievement of the year at the Women in Film and Television Awards . She was widely regarded as the star of the BBC presenting line-up this summer – outshining main host Gary Lineker according to many viewers. In her acceptance speech, she said: ‘I hope that in the future you’re going to see female anchors working together and you’ll see female commentators, which is the next big breakthrough. ‘There are one or two who do commentating but very few. Obviously sports presenters you see women who’ve done phenomenally well - Hazel [Irvine], Gabby [Logan], Sue [Barker], Mishal Husain, all of us working together and knowing our stuff. ‘I think that’s what we’ve been valued for. I take the award on behalf of all of the women in sports television.’ TV equality: Clare Balding was honored at the Women in Film and Television Awards for her work as a presenter during the London 2012 Olympics and in her acceptance speech she said she hoped to see more female anchors working together . Dedicated to women: Miss Balding (pictured left with Paralympic Games presenters Adam Hills, Daraine Mulvihill, Ade Adepitan and Arthur Williams) said awards dedicated to women would encourage future generations . Miss Balding added that awards dedicated to the achievements of women were important as they helped encourage future generations. She explained: ‘I think it’s important for young girls who are, I hope, watching us and thinking “that’s a job I want to do” to know that warmth, humour, intelligence, doing your homework - that’s what matters. I’m not getting this award because of what I look like, or my dress sense. We all know that.’ 'Knowing our stuff': Miss Balding (pictured carrying the Olympic flame) said there were some women commentators doing well . Her comments come after debate has raged over the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award, with many arguing for separate categories for men and women. Former Olympic champion Denise Lewis has called for ‘female’ and ‘male’ categories to make sure women’s achievements are not overlooked. The 39-year-old, who secured gold in the heptathlon at the Sydney Games in 2000, insisted the current system was not fair. Not a single woman made the 2011 shortlist, although this year five are nominated including Olympic and Paralympic champions Jessica Ennis and Ellie Simmonds. The results are voted for by the public but cyclist Bradley Wiggins and tennis star Andy Murray are frontrunners to win. The Women in Film and Television event was hosted by Great British Bake-Off co-presenter Sue Perkins and guests included Lisa Faulkner, Danny Boyle, Davina McCall and Julie Walters. Miss Walters, who presented one of the awards, added that women needed to work together because the film and television industry was tougher for them than their male counterparts. She said: ‘We struggle, as opposed to men, who don’t struggle quite so much. We have to support one another.’ Need to support each other: Former Olympic champion Denise Lewis (right) said there should be 'male' and 'female' categories to make sure women's achievements are not overlooked while Julie Walters (left) said women struggle 'as opposed to men'","The 41-year-old presenter was honoured at the Women in Film and Television Awards for her work presenting during the London Olympics .

"Researchers have identified the voice of Alexander Graham Bell for the first time in some of the earliest audio recordings ever created. The National Museum of American History discovered the recording on a wax disc from 1885, which had been donated to the Smithsonian Museum. Recent technological advances have allowed the recordings to be played for the first time in over 100 years. Scroll down to hear the recording . The phonorecord by Alexander Graham Bell which contains the only known recording of his voice. The National Museum of American History identified the recording with help from technicians at the Library of Congress and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California . Best known for the first practical telephone, Alexander Graham Bell was born in Edinburgh and was an eminent scientist, inventor, engineer and innovator. Both his mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing Bell's life's work into hearing devices, and he was awarded the first US patent for the telephone in 1876. However, Bell considered his most famous invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study. He went on to carry out groundbreaking work in optical telecommunications, hydrofoils and aeronautics, and in 1888, Bell became one of the founding members of the National Geographic Society. Technicians at the Library of Congress and the Lawrence . Berkeley National Laboratory in California worked with the museum, which holds some of the earliest audio recordings ever made. Researchers found a transcript of one recording signed by Bell. It was matched to a wax disc recording from April 15, 1885. 'Hear my voice, Alexander Graham Bell,' the inventor is heard to say. The experimental recording also includes a series of numbers. The transcript notes the record was made at Bell's Volta Laboratory in Washington. Other recordings from the time include lines from Shakespeare. In late 2011, scientists played back some of Bell's earliest recordings for the first time with new technology that reads the sound digitally from tiny grooves in the wax disc using light and a 3D camera. The breakthrough offered a glimpse at the experiments with sound and recording at the dawn of the information age when inventors were scrambling to secure patents for the first telephones and phonographs. The recordings were packed away for more . than 100 years and were deemed obsolete until new technology allowed . them to be replayed. 'Identifying the voice of Alexander . Graham Bell, the man who brought us everyone else's voice, is a major . moment in the study of history,' said John Gray, director of the . Smithsonian's American history museum, in announcing the find. 'It enriches what we know about the late 1800s - who spoke, what they said and how they said it.' In autumn 2011, Patrick Feaster, an . Indiana University sound-media historian, compiled an exhaustive . inventory of notations on the discs and cylinders - many scratched on . wax and all but illegible. A closeup of the recording that revealed Alexander Graham Bell's voice for the first time . The grooves that identified Alexander Graham Bell: Modern technology allowed the wax disc to be replayed for the first time in over 100 years . Documents indicated that one wax-and-cardboard disc, from April 15, 1885, a date now deciphered from a wax inscription, contained a recording of Bell speaking. On June 20, 2012, at the Library of Congress, a team heard the recording for the first time this century. From the 1880s on, until his death in 1922, Bell gave an extensive collection of laboratory materials to the Smithsonian Institution, where he was a member of the Board of Regents. The donation included more than 400 discs and cylinders Bell used as he tried his hand at recording sound. The holdings also documented Bell’s research, should patent disputes arise similar to the protracted legal wrangling that attended the invention of the telephone. The museum also identified the voice of Alexander Melville Bell, the famous inventor's father, in an 1881 recording. Bell deposited this recording and his recording machine at the Smithsonian in 1881 in case of a patent dispute. He conducted his sound experiments between 1880 and 1886, collaborating with his cousin Chichester Bell and technician Charles Sumner Tainter. They worked at Bell’s Volta Laboratory, at 1221 Connecticut Avenue in Washington, originally established inside what had been a stable. In 1877, his great rival, Thomas Edison, had recorded sound on embossed foil; Bell was eager to improve the process. Some of Bell’s research on light and sound during this period anticipated fiber-optic communications. Bell on the telephone in New York (calling Chicago) in 1892 . Bell had long been fascinated by the idea of transmitting speech as oth his mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing Bell's life's work into hearing devices.

"Many football managers nowadays pay more attention to statistics and sports science than ever before, but few will have ever gone this far. Professor Stephen Hawking has produced a mathematical formula to guarantee England success at this summer’s World Cup in Brazil - and also on how to take the ‘perfect penalty’. The Cambridge physicist analysed data from every tournament since 1966 - but he believes the heat, the altitude and the distance from home could all scupper England's chances. Scroll down for video . Technical: Professor Stephen Hawking unveils a new scientific formula to predict the chances of England succeeding in the World Cup - and another on how to take the perfect penalty, in Cambridge . Professor Stephen Hawking has produced a mathematical formula, pictured, to guarantee England success at this summer's World Cup in Brazil - and also on how to take the 'perfect penalty' Numbers game: The Cambridge physicist analysed data from every tournament since 1966 - but he believes the heat, the altitude and the distance from home could all scupper England's chances . However, he thinks prospects for manager . Roy Hodgson's men will be improved if they get a European referee for . their group stage match with Uruguay on June 19. He . said match officials from the northern hemisphere will be less . sympathetic to the on-pitch dramatics of the country’s mercurial striker . Luis Suarez of Liverpool. Professor . Hawking, whose analysis was commissioned by bookmakers Paddy Power, has . also come up with ‘a formula for the perfect penalty’. He said: ‘Ever . since the dawn of civilisation, people have not been content to see . events as unconnected and inexplicable. They have craved an . understanding of the underlying order in the world. The World Cup is no . different.’ The professor, whose book A Brief . History Of Time was a best-seller, has appeared in shows such as The . Simpsons and The Big Bang Theory and even starred in an advert for the . website Go Compare. Graphical: The effect of home and away kits on England performances in the European Championships and World Cup . Historical data: This graph shows how England have fared in matches against opponents from each continent . Line up: Professor Hawking said that England should play 4-3-3 rather than 4-4-2, based on its success . He said . England's chances of success could be worked out by examining . ‘environmental, physiological, psychological, political and tactical . variables’. Falling over: Professor Hawking took a swipe at 'ballerina' Luis Suarez of Liverpool and Uruguay . Professor Hawking added: ‘Statistically England's red kit is more successful and we should play 4-3-3 rather than 4-4-2. ‘Psychologists . in Germany found red makes teams feel more confident and can lead them . to being perceived as more aggressive and dominant. ‘Likewise, 4-3-3 is more positive so the team benefits for similar psychological reasons. ‘The . data shows we also need to hope for a European referee. European . referees are more sympathetic to the English game and less sympathetic . to ballerinas like Suarez. ‘Like . all animals, the England team are creatures of habit. Being closer to . home reduces the negative impact of cultural differences and jetlag. We . do better in temperate climates, at low altitudes with kick-off as close . to the normal three o'clock as possible. ‘The . impact of environmental factors alone is quite staggering. A 5C rise in . temperature reduces our chances of winning by 59 per cent. ‘We . are twice as likely to win when playing below 500 metres (1,600ft) above sea . level. And our chances of winning improve by a third when kicking off at . three o'clock local time.’ Professor . Hawking also outlined his formula for taking penalties. He said the key . to success was a run-up of more than three steps and giving the ball . ‘some welly’, but ‘velocity is nothing without placement’. Looking back: The physicist analysed data from every tournament since 1966 - when Bobby Moore lifted the trophy for England . Three Lions: England's Frank Lampard, Danny Welbeck, Joe Hart, Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney and Leighton Baines celebrate victory after a World Cup 2014 qualifying match against Poland at Wembley last October . 'This will remain one of science's great mysteries': Professor Hawking said there is no evidence that it's advantageous to be left or right-footed but bald players and fair-haired players are more likely to score . Goalkeeper mobility: Players should place the ball in the top left or right hand corner when taking a penalty . He said: ‘If only I had whispered this in Chris Waddle's ear before he sent the ball into orbit in 1990. Use the side foot rather than laces and you are 10 per cent more likely to score. 'A 5C rise in temperature reduces our chances of winning by 59 per cent. We are twice as likely to win when playing below 500 metres above sea level' Professor Stephen Hawking . ‘The statistics confirm the obvious. Place the ball in the top left or right hand corner for the best chance of success - 84 per cent of penalties in those areas score. ‘The ability of strikers to place the ball results in them being more likely to score than midfielders and defenders. ‘There is no evidence that it's advantageous to be left or right-footed but bald players and fair-haired players are more likely to score. The reason for this is unclear. This will remain one of science's great mysteries.’ Paddy Power, spokesman for Paddy Power, said: ‘The modern game is so full of statistical analysis that for us it was a no brainer to call on Professor Hawking to give England some help.’ Famous: Paul the Octopus correctly predicted the outcome of eight matches at the 2010 World Cup, including Germany's thrashing of England and Spain's victory over the Netherlands in the final. He died later that year . Four years ago at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Paul the Octopus gained legendary status after correctly predicting the results of various games. 'Bald players and fair-haired players are more likely to score. The reason for this is unclear. This will remain one of science's great mysteries' Professor Stephen Hawking on penalties . The tentacled creature correctly predicted the outcome of eight matches at the 2010 World Cup, including Germany's thrashing of England and Spain's victory over the Netherlands in the final. He cost bookmakers thousands after floating languidly towards boxes of mussels draped in the colours of competing teams in the tournament. He died in his sleep in October that year, but his former carers at the Sea Life Centre in Oberhausen, Germany, decided he should be given a shrine to mark his seemingly expert predictions. Formula for success: Professor Stephen Hawking and Paddy Power, spokesman for Paddy Power . Professor Stephen Hawking, 72, has lived with debilitating motor neurone disease since the age of 22 but despite this cruel struggle he still became the world's most renowned astrophysicist. He is a sufferer of the most common form of motor neurone fisease - amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - which has robbed him of almost all physical movement . He is an exceptional case, having survived for more than 40 years, despite doctors giving him just two years to live when first diagnosed. In his incredible life his countless scientific papers, best-selling books and numerous awards have earned him comparisons with Albert Einstein and Sir Isaac Newton. But he is as much a celebrity as he is a scientist, appearing on TV cartoon The Simpsons, starring in Star Trek and providing narration for a British Telecom commercial that was later sampled on a Pink Floyd album. In the 1970s, already confined to a wheelchair, he produced a stream of first class research, including probably his most important contribution to cosmology. This was the discovery of Hawking radiation, which allows a black hole to leak energy and gradually fade away to nothing. By applying quantum mechanics to black holes, he had taken the first steps to combining quantum theory and general relativity. One describes the universe at the sub-atomic level, and the other at very large scales. Bringing the two theories together is one of the great unfulfilled goals of modern physics. In the 1980s, Professor Hawking and Professor Jim Hartle, from the University of California at Santa Barbara, proposed a model of the universe which had no boundaries in space or time. The concept was described in A Brief History Of Time, which sold 25million copies worldwide. In recent years, Professor Hawking has examined the relationship between science and religion, writing a 2010 book, Grand Design, which argues that evoking God is not necessary to explain the origins of the universe. He met the Pope at a scientific event hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in 2008.","Chances could be scuppered by heat, altitude and distance from home .

He wrote and presented his own History of Modern . Britain and The Making of Modern Britain for BBC2, which were hugely . popular with viewers and won prestigious awards from the Royal . Television Society, the Broadcasting Press Guild and BAFTA. His more recent offerings include the Diamond Queen documentary and his . most recent show, History of the World was broadcast on BBC1 before . Christmas.

Former Labour Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott spoke about Marr on Twitter . Conservative Party leader David Cameron is interviewed in his home on The Andrew Marr Show in January, 2009 . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, pictured here in December last year, is due to appear on Mr Marr's show soon . A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. The brain needs oxygen and nutrients provided by blood to function properly, but if the supply is restricted or stopped, brain cells begin to die. Speed of treatment is of the essence when dealing with a stroke, because the sooner a person receives help, the less damage is likely to happen. Smoking, being overweight, lack of exercise and a poor diet are also risk factors for stroke. Also, conditions that affect the circulation of the blood, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, atrial fibrillation (an irregular heartbeat) and diabetes, increase the risk of having a stroke. NHS Direct says the main symptoms of stroke can be remembered with the word FAST: Face-Arms-Speech-Time. Face – the face may have dropped on one side, the person may not be able to smile or their mouth or eye may have dropped . Arms – the person with suspected stroke may not be able to lift one or both arms and keep them there because of arm weakness or numbness . Speech – their speech may be slurred or garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all despite appearing to be awake . Time – it is time to dial 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms . He began his career in journalism on The Scotsman newspaper in 1981, later moving to London to become its political correspondent. Marr was part of the team which launched The Independent in 1986 and returned as its editor, after a stint at The Economist magazine. He was then a columnist for The Express and The Observer before making the move into television, as the BBC's Political Editor, in May 2000. He has also presented a number of history programmes along with his politics show and has had five books published. In May 2011 it emerged that he had taken out a super-injunction to prevent the reporting of an affair. He won a High Court order in January 2008 to silence the press following his extra-marital affair with another national newspaper reporter. He admitted he had taken the step as he said he felt 'uneasy' about it as a journalist. The woman with whom he had the affair is a political journalist who has a daughter. Since their fling, some nine years ago, her name has appeared widely online. Mr Marr is considered young to have suffered a stroke, as the vast majority of the 150,000 people who suffer the attack every year in England are over 65. According to NHS figures, in England, strokes are a major health problem, and are the third largest cause of death, after heart disease and cancer. The brain damage caused by strokes means that they are the largest cause of adult disability in the UK, but it also possible to make a full recovery. Joe Korner, director of communications at the Stroke Association said: 'We are deeply saddened to hear about Andrew Marr's stroke and our thoughts are with him and his family at this hard time. 'One hundred and fifty thousand people have a stroke every year in the UK and around a quarter of these are in people of working age. 'A stroke happens in an instant but the effects can often last a lifetime. However with the right care and support it is possible to make a recovery and return to a life after stroke.' * Former BBC director general Alasdair Milne has died at the age of 82 after a series of strokes. Milne led the Corporation between 1982 and 1987 before he was forced to resign after a series of rows with Margaret Thatcher’s government. Acting director general Tim Davie yesterday said he was a 'charismatic editorial figure' behind some 'outstanding' programmes. Milne is survived by his daughter and two sons.","BBC spokesman said: 'Andrew Marr is .

"Lord McAlpine is taking landmark legal action against internet gossips who falsely branded him a paedophile. Lawyers for the Tory peer warned Twitter users ‘we know who you are’ and urged them to come forward voluntarily or face being pursued through the courts. His action is intended to stop so-called ‘trial by Twitter’ and, if successful, could radically change the way the internet is policed and make those using social networks more directly accountable for defamatory comments. Lord McAlpine, the former Tory party treasurer wrongly accused of being a child abuser following a botched Newsnight report, yesterday agreed a £185,000 compensation settlement with the BBC – funded by licence-payers. Scroll down for video . Battles: Many have apologised to the Tory peer but his legal team has said that people have destroyed his reputation . ITV’s This Morning and Sally Bercow, . wife of the House of Commons Speaker and a prolific Twitter user, were . next in the firing line. Lord McAlpine’s lawyer Andrew Reid . said those suspected of defaming the peer would receive a letter before . action was taken telling them they had 48 hours to respond. He said . there was a ‘very long list’ of people to whom letters would be sent. Lord McAlpine, 70, said no amount of . compensation could repair the damage to his reputation from being . branded a paedophile. He told the BBC: ‘There is nothing as bad as this . that you can do to people.’ Describing his revulsion at the false . accusations, the former Thatcher aide said: ‘It gets into your bones, it . makes you angry. And it gets into your soul. You just think there’s . something wrong with the world.’ Twitter gaffe: Speaker's wife Sally Bercow arrived at the Vaudeville Theatre to watch a performance of Uncle Vanya last night. She is facing a legal claim by Lord McAlpine after joining a frenzy of paedophile speculation and is yet to contact them to apologise . The fiasco began on Twitter when Iain . Overton, managing editor of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, . which jointly produced the Newsnight report, sent a Twitter message . saying: ‘If all goes well we’ve got a Newsnight out tonight about a very . senior political figure who is a paedophile.’ The message prompted a maelstrom of . internet speculation about the man’s identity, despite Newsnight’s . decision not to broadcast a name that night, November 2. On November 4, Mrs Bercow tweeted, . ‘Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *Innocent face*’, a reference to the . fact the peer’s name was being repeatedly mentioned on Twitter. Mrs Bercow later apologised on Twitter . but Lord McAlpine’s lawyers said she had not approached them to make a . personal apology to the peer. Mr Reid told Radio 4’s World At One . programme: ‘Very sadly, we are going to have to take action against a . lot of people. 'The next person on our list is in fact the This Morning . programme, run by ITV, where Phillip Schofield managed to embarrass the . Prime Minister... and then destroy my client’s reputation.’ Schofield confronted David Cameron with a supposed list of paedophiles live on air last week. The Newsnight investigation into child . sex allegations at the Bryn Estyn children’s home in North Wales in the . 1970s was a joint project with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, . which is also being sued by Lord McAlpine. Neither organisation contacted the peer to allow him to respond to allegations he was involved in the abuse. Tweet: Sally Bercow was ordered to pay £15,000, which was donated to charity, after posted the above tweet . BBC director general George Entwistle resigned over the fiasco and Mr Overton quit his job over his disastrous Twitter message. Lord McAlpine’s lawyers said anyone who had made allegations on social media should contact them or face a legal battle. Mr Reid said: ‘Let it be a lesson to . everybody that trial by Twitter or trial by the internet is a very nasty . way of hurting people unnecessarily and it will cost people a lot of . money.’ As part of yesterday’s settlement, the . BBC agreed additionally to pay Lord McAlpine’s legal costs. The bill . could approach £100,000. Catalyst: The crisis for Lord McAlpine was all started by Newsnight's 'shabby' investigation into abuse at a Welsh children's home . Watch the video here . Newsnight carried a full, on-air . apology for the broadcast a week later and Lord McAlpine’s World At One . interview was carried across BBC news broadcasts yesterday. In the interview, he said he was . ‘conscious’ that his £185,000 settlement would be paid by . licence-payers, and not directly by those who made or authorised the . programme. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism . published an apology to Lord McAlpine on its website ‘for the extent to . which its contribution to the Newsnight broadcast on 2 November fell . short of the high standards it expects and for any incorrect speculation . about the identity of the politician that may have been encouraged by . the Bureau’s Managing Editor’s tweet in advance of the broadcast’. Dressing down: Schofield and members of the team behind the stunt have been chastised by ITV management .

"An Australian glamour model has come out swinging at a men's magazine after they apparently misquoted her in an article which accompanied her racy photoshoot. Juliana Cameron claims during the interview - which accompanied the six-page swimsuit spread - she told the reporter she was not a party girl and doesn't smoke, drink or have sex. However, in their July 2013 issue, they ran a quote which said: 'I've got absolutely no problem with being naked anywhere', alongside an image of her straddled on the ground in a white singlet and red G-string. The magazine has reportedly offered Cameron, from Sydney, a private apology over the incident but she is pushing for them to issue a public statement. Juliana Cameron has accused men's magazine Zoo of misrepresenting her in their July issue last year . Cameron has received a private apology from the magazine's editor but is pushing for a public one . The racy shoot also featured Cameron in an array of skimpy bikinis, and one shot showed her pouring water over herself from a red watering can. In a petition launched in the past few days the bikini model has branded the magazine's conduct as 'a form of sexual violence against women' and says it is 'a form of gender based discrimination and a form of violence against women'. Cameron met Bondi Vet Dr Chris Brown at a fundraiser a few years ago . The bikini model has launched a petition against the magazine accusing them of gender based discrimination . Alongside the petition she wrote 'women deserve to be safe regardless of whether they are wearing a bikini or wearing an eskimo suit' Cameron said the false claims they printed about her was 'unethical' and said the magazine was creating 'a rape culture against women who have body confidence'. 'During the interview I shared that I'm actually not a party girl, I don't drink alcohol, I don't smoke and I'm also celibate too,' she wrote alongside the petition. 'The men's magazine proceeded to misrepresent my interview and made false representations about me, which is a form of sexual violence against women.' 'Women can have both body confidence and boundaries. Women deserve to be safe regardless of whether they are wearing a bikini or wearing an eskimo suit.' The 26-year-old said it was not up to magazine to decided how to represent her body . She said they misquoted her on 'I've got absolutely no problem with being naked anywhere' The model pictured with Lara Bingle at and event in 2012 . A year after the spread was published she has been issued with a personal apology from Zoo editor Shayne Bugden, according to news.com.au, but Cameron said she went through a huge ordeal just to get to that, and it took up a lot of her time and resources. 'Zoo was making all these false representations about me and as a result I ended up getting sexually harassed by the male readers of the magazine,' Ms Cameron told the website. She said it was not up to Zoo to decide how to represent her body and said the situation was a 'male abuse of power'. The personal apology apparently acknowledged that the glamour model was in fact misrepresented, but Cameron is pushing for a public admission of Zoo's alleged wrongdoing. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Zoo for a comment but they are yet to respond. Cameron said she was sexually harassed by the male readers of the magazine after the article was published .","Juliana Cameron appeared in Zoo magazine last July .

"Danny Baker may be offered a new weekly show only hours after his furious on-air tirade at the axing of his daily radio slot. The development emerged after around 250 listeners complained to the BBC about the demise of his afternoon programme broadcast in the capital. Hundreds more took to social networking sites to voice their unhappiness and criticise executives for calling a day on The  Treehouse on BBC London. Tirade: Danny Baker told his Twitter followers not to worry about him after he announced his show was being axed - saying he could always sell his Sony Awards, which he promptly posted a picture of (shown above) Yesterday, however, it was revealed that the 55-year-old DJ is in talks with Radio 2 and TalkSport about possible work. During . his live rant on Thursday, he said he was not told directly that he was . being sacked and claimed managers asked him to keep the matter quiet. Baker, who co-presents the show with Amy Lame and Baylen Leonard, known . as the Candy Crew, then continued on Twitter. He raged that middle managers were ‘dim bulbs’. Announcement: Danny Baker announced the news on Twitter - he later claimed he only found out himself after reading it in an old magazine in a doctor's waiting room today . Bad timing: The announcement came two days to the day that Mr Baker announced he had cancer . Keeping it quiet: Danny Baker claims the BBC asked him not to announce the news for two weeks . Supporter Jo Coughlin has launched a petition calling for the show and its star to be spared. ‘This . is a mere radio show on BBC London but means a lot to a lot of people,’ she said. ‘Danny Baker and the Candy Crew have a genius ability to make . a lot of people happy, relaxed and escape to a land where BBC suits . don’t exist and anything is possible. Danny Baker announced on November 1, 2010, that he had been diagnosed with throat and mouth . cancer. He started chemotherapy straight away before  undergoing radiotherapy in . January. The presenter lost 2½ stone and his sense of taste during his treatment. When . he was named speech radio personality of the year at the Sony Radio . Academy Awards the DJ joked: ‘I’ve lost two-and-a-half stone, but I . won’t be bringing out a DVD on how I did it.’ To . a standing ovation, he added: ‘I look all right – but I’ve had a . horrible, horrible time. It’s been really awful. I am not quite here.’ But he was eventually given the all-clear in June last year. After receiving the news, he tweeted: ‘The call I have been waiting for just happened. 'Turns out I won. I’m all clear. I’m well again.’ The . presenter then resumed his long-running BBC London afternoon radio show . and weekly Radio 5 Live programme, both of which he still hosted until . today. ‘We need to save this show and . at least get it transferred to another station immediately.’ Another fan . Tim MacGregor added: ‘Is the BBC mad? Axing Danny Baker – one of their . best broadcasters.’ Baker has also had high-profile backing from comedian Rob  Brydon, presenter Miriam O’Reilly and actor Stephen Mangan. The Treehouse is due to run until the end of the year but it is unclear if Baker will return. He . also presents a Saturday morning show on Radio Five Live and will be . honoured next week by being inducted into the Radio Academy Hall of . Fame. On Twitter, he wrote of his bosses: ‘In the main they are dull . ex-university types who are “fascinated” by “real” people. Meetings are . how they view “work”. ‘Being LEAST necessary people to shows, they’ve . created a culture whereby they are the MOST vital. [There are] far more . meeting rooms than studios at BBC.’ A Corporation spokesman said: . ‘Discussions have been taking place with Danny Baker’s management . company for some time about him leaving his afternoon show on BBC .

"Expenses: Former BBC director general Mark Thompson, pictured, spent almost £6,000 on travel to the US in his final few months in charge of the corporation . Former BBC director general Mark Thompson spent almost £6,000 on travel to the US in his final few months in charge of the corporation. Senior managers’ hotel and rail expenses have doubled since 2009, according to new figures for the first financial quarter of the year from the BBC. They also reveal that despite cutbacks to budgets – three executives received pay rises of up to 20 per cent. Thompson’s final round of expenses show the executive took a return flight to San Francisco costing £5,789 and then flew on to Los Angeles for £128 as part of a trip in June. The 55-year-old also enjoyed a £666.55 trip to Berlin during the same month. It has already been revealed that he took a £3,245.73 return flight to New York in February. The figures, which detail the expenses and pay of the top 100 executives at the BBC, also showed that despite pledges to keep executive pay in check, some were still enjoying inflation-busting pay rises. Ben Stephenson, BBC drama commissioning controller, was given a £33,400 pay rise, which is a jump of around 21 per cent to bring his salary to £195,000. Human resources executive Karl Burnett was given a £10,000 increase to take his pay to £121,000. Jenny Baxter, controller of production for BBC News, received a boost of £4,545 bringing her salary to £121,200. A BBC spokesman said the pay rises were due to the executives taking on additional responsibilities or expanded roles. Insiders also admitted that the BBC’s rail and hotel bills have soared since 2009 because of the move to Salford and the push to make more programmes outside of London. The broadcaster has set a target that 50 per cent of its content must be made outside the capital, and has moved key shows to the nations and regions. This has led to a jump in rail and hotel bills – expenses claimed for hotels between April and June this year were £28,318 compared to £16,678 in 2009/10. Similarly the total cost of rail travel claimed was £45,905 for that quarter, but just two years ago it was £22, 873. Hike: Insiders admitted that the BBC's rail and hotel bills have soared since 2009 because of the move to Salford and the push to make more programmes outside of London . But the BBC said its overall expenses - taxis, hotels, flights, rail and hospitality combined - were down year-on-year. A spokesman said: ‘Expenses have risen by one per cent this quarter but are down eight per cent on the previous year. Successor: Former director general of the BBC George Entwistle, pictured, who was given the position following Mr Thompson's departure . ‘Taxi costs in particular have come down by 2 this quarter and are down 57% since publication began in 2009.’ ‘Expenses remain within a range that is proportionate to running a media organisation of this size. We continue to be mindful of how we spend public money and to drive down costs wherever possible.’ Thompson was named chief executive of the New York Times in August after months of speculation he had interviewed for the job. The newspaper had been looking for a replacement since previous boss Janet Robinson stepped down in December. But the BBC said he did not use his time in America to “find a new role”, insisting his trips had full itineraries relating to his work as director general. The executive, who was paid more than £670,000 by the BBC last year, took up his new job in November, but has been embroiled in the fallout from the Jimmy Savile scandal. Thompson had to fly back to the UK at the end of November to give evidence at the Pollard Inquiry, the external investigation into whether management pressure was a factor into the decision to shelve the Newsnight into abuse by Savile. The issue arose under his tenure at the BBC and critics have questioned Thompson’s involvement in it all.","Former BBC chief spent almost £6,000 in return flight to San Francisco .

"Police say a Denver man accused of killing his wife while hallucinating on marijuana-infused candy asked his seven-year-old son to kill him so 'dad and mom could be together with God.' That was the testimony of Detective Troy Bisgard who took the stand during a preliminary hearing Friday in the case of Richard Kirk. Kirk had eaten marijuana-infused candy before the attack, according to search warrants released Thursday, before shooting wife Kristine Kirk. Police say Richard Kirk asked his son, 7, to kill him so he could join wife Kristine 'with God' shortly after he shot and killed her . Better days: Police said two of the couple's unnamed boys were outside the house waiting when they arrived while the seven-year-old was discovered inside with Richard . Kirk reportedly purchased and ate the candy only hours before the tragic shooting, The Denver Channel reports. He had also reportedly bought ammunition for his 9mm semiautomatic handgun just hours before eating the candy. The couple had reportedly been having troubles recently, owing $2,500 to the IRS and having more than $40,000 in credit card debt. It appears that the gun malfunctioned after Mrs. Kirk was shot, preventing Richard Kirk from firing it again. Bisgard testified the bullet magazine was not properly seated in the gun handle, keeping the weapon from loading another bullet into the chamber from the magazine following the single shot that allegedly killed Mrs. Kirk. An unfired bullet was discovered in their son's basement room. Two of the Kirk's unnamed sons were waiting outside the front door when officers arrived at the scene while Richard Kirk was found with his seven-year-old in the house. Bisgard also testified that police found an empty vial bearing a label for prescription painkillers. Kirk has a bad back. The . Denver Police Department released the warrants as they investigate . whether the pot may have caused Richard Kirk, 47, to hallucinate . and kill his wife. Detectives discovered powerful marijuana edibles in the home along with prescription painkillers . Mrs . Kirk, 44, called police Monday night, telling dispatchers her husband . ate marijuna candy and had taken prescription pain pills before he . started hallucinating and scaring their three young sons. She told dispatchers he was 'talking about the end of the world, and he wanted her to shoot him,' documents say.

Police . are also conducting an internal investigating into whether they . responded quickly enough to Kristine Kirk's call, since she died on the . line with a dispatcher. That dispatcher has since been placed on paid leave. Police have since obtained a receipt, finding that Kirk purchased items . including a marijuana-lace candy called 'Karma Kandy Orange Ginger'.

On Gaia Garden's website, they describe . their KarmaKandy as 'conviently sized and incredibly delicious'. 'A single bite is enough, even for those with intense medicinal needs,' the company warns. As Mrs Kirk's 911 call continued, she told the dispatcher that her husband had retrieved a weapon. 'She . next related that he had the gun and she did not know where to go,' the . warrants say. A few seconds later, Mrs Kirk could be heard screaming. Then there was a single gunshot and the line went quiet. Richard Kirk's 9mm gun allegedly malfunctioned after he gunned down his wife, preventing him from firing another shot . Police said she was shot about 12 to 13 minutes into the call, which has not yet been released.

He was also . rambling and quickly confessed to killing his wife. Investigators are now analyzing Kirk's blood sample to see if he was on any other drugs at the time. Officials have refused to release Mrs Kirk's 911 call, since there's still an open investigation.

He visited the family in January . and was unaware of any drug use by his son. 'It was a great family,' he said. 'He seemed very happy.'

"A woman has found a three foot boa constrictor in the boot of a second hand car she bought online. Charlie Wise from Thatcham, in Berkshire, saw the Volkswagen Golf advertised on a social networking site and bought it for £200. She had taken it home to clean and lifted the boot where she and husband Guy Wise noticed what they thought was a rubber toy curled up in the back. The three-foot long boa constrictor was found in the boot of the second hand car by Charlie Wise in Berkshire . At first Mrs Wise thought it was a rubber toy but when it stuck tongue out she realised it was a real snake . But when it flicked its tongue in and out they realised it was in fact real and slammed the boot and ran away. The 23-year-old nursery worker said: ‘I bought a car come home to clean it out as right mess to find a huge live snake in the boot. ‘It’s huge and scary.’ ‘We screamed and slammed the boot.’ After both the police and RSPCA said they were unable to help until morning, Mrs Wise called the  Berkshire Reptile Rescue, at Bracknell, and specialist Grahame Martin came out to take the snake away. Mrs Wise added: ' We called him after RSPCA and police very late at night coem and meet us to take the snake off us, and he got it out the boot of the car. 'The snake was in a very poor condition. It was highly dehydrated, and blind in one of its eyes. He is now taking care of all of its treatment. 'I think he is a credit  - he is the only bloke in our area who does this sort of thing and he really helped us out. Without him I would have to keep a snake in my house all night. He deserves all the credit for this rescue.' She rang the car's previous owner - Christopher Morrison, of Bracknell, Berkshire - who told her he had lost his three-year-old snake two months ago. The roofer and reptile collector said he was moving the snake in a cage to a friend’s house when it vanished. She was cleaning out the used car when she found the snake in the boot, which she slammed shut and fled . Mr Morrison, 29, said: ‘I lost it a couple of months ago. ‘I did have it in a cage and was moving it to my mates. It got out. ‘I checked everywhere. I had ripped that car to pieces. I thought it must have got out. ‘I wouldn’t leave it.’ Mr Morrison’s heavily pregnant girlfriend, Sammi Larkins, who co-owned the car, added: ‘We wouldn’t have sold it if we thought it was in there.’ He accepted it would not be a pleasant experience to make such a discovery.","Charlie Wise, 23, was cleaning her new car boot when she found the snake .

"Radio 5 Live presenter Victoria Derbyshire led a growing mutiny against BBC chiefs yesterday as ‘civil war’ broke out over the Jimmy Savile crisis. She publicly rounded on senior figures after Newsnight editor Peter Rippon was ‘hung out to dry’ by the director-general, George Entwistle. BBC executives at the heart of the scandal have now enlisted personal lawyers as the blame game turns increasingly vicious. Scroll down for video . Radio 5 prime-time DJ Victoria Derbyshire publicly rounded on senior BBC figures over the Savile scandal . Miss Derbyshire speaking to her 32,000 followers on Twitter . Up close: Helen Boaden was pictured today in a . cuddly clinch with Jimmy Savile who is accused of more than 200 . allegations of abuse, in 2006. Ms Boaden allegedly had 'impossibly high demands' for the investigation . During his grilling by MPs on Tuesday, . Mr Entwistle barely missed a chance to twist the knife over Mr Rippon’s . disastrous handling of Newsnight’s Savile investigation. But his . strategy to heap all the blame on Mr Rippon sparked a backlash at the . corporation – and calls for BBC News boss Helen Boaden to be quizzed . about claims she was involved in the debacle too. Both she and her deputy, Stephen . Mitchell, and Mr Rippon have all employed individual personal lawyers to . advise them, it is understood. One source said: ‘It feels like civil . war. The relationship between management and the news division is at an . all-time low. 'No one [linked to the scandal] in news wants to say . anything without a lawyer present. There is zero trust at how management . will handle all this. It is a mess.’ The . BBC announced Mr Rippon had 'stepped aside' on Monday as it corrected . inaccuracies in his October 2 blog . There is also a split within news with . some journalists now accusing the Panorama team of having looked into . Savile a year before the planned Newsnight investigation. The BBC said . Panorama strenuously denied this. Yesterday Miss Derbyshire told her . 32,000 followers on Twitter: ‘If BBC journos/Eds make a poor editorial . call, (& most of us hve at some point), will they be treated by . mgemnt like Peter Rippon has been?’ Former Radio 4 Today programme editor . Rod Liddle said Mr Entwistle had ‘dobbed Peter Rippon in’. He told . Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman: ‘Entwistle looked as though he was hanging . the editor out to dry, as members of your staff are hanging the editor . out to dry,’ and added: ‘I find it very, very difficult to accept there . was no pressure on Rippon.’ Mr Rippon was ordered by the . director-general to ‘step aside’ from his role this week after he wrote . an error-strewn blog on why he canned Newsnight’s investigation into . Savile. He has come under fire for allegedly . ‘killing’ the Savile expose by declaring the victims were ‘not too . young’ and saying ‘they weren’t the worst kind of sexual offences’. Embattled Mr Rippon has repeatedly insisted he alone took the decision . to scrap the Newsnight film without anyone more senior ‘leaning’ on him . to do so. Yesterday it emerged his boss Helen . Boaden, director of BBC News, could face questioning from the same . committee of MPs that grilled Mr Entwistle. It was claimed she allegedly set an . ‘impossibly high barrier’ before Newsnight’s plans to expose Savile by . insisting journalists act as though he was still alive and be able to . sue the BBC for libel. Her intervention last year is said to have influenced Mr Rippon’s decision to scrap the report. Liz . MacKean, a Newsnight reporter, speaking on Panorama earlier this week. She apparently believed Helen Boaden put a block on the programme's six week Savile probe which influenced Mr Rippon's decision . Miss Boaden, 56, has not publicly . uttered a word about her role since the scandal engulfed the corporation . nearly four weeks ago. In 2006, she was photographed in high spirits . with Savile at an awards lunch, and she and her husband own a holiday . home in Scarborough, one of Savile’s favourite haunts. The £340,000-a-year news chief told Mr . Rippon that ‘just because Jimmy Savile was dead, it didn’t mean there . could be any skimping in journalistic standards’, Mr Entwistle told MPs. Asked whether Mr Rippon might have . interpreted that as pressure from above to drop the investigation, Mr . Entwistle said it had not been ‘an inappropriate point to make’. But a Newsnight source told The Times . that Meirion Jones and Liz MacKean, the journalists leading the . programme’s investigation, believed Miss Boaden’s intervention had . effectively blocked their report, adding: ‘Boaden placed an impossibly . high barrier to the story.’ Mr Mitchell, Miss Boaden’s deputy, is . also under the spotlight after it was confirmed he had read the . Newsnight editor’s ‘inaccurate’ blog before publication.

"Adults in Britain spend nine years of their life watching television - including three years wasted on ""rubbish"" programmes and repeats. A survey of 2000 people found on average Britons now spend three-and-a-half hours of hours in front of the small screen each day. Research by TV streaming service Blinkbox found this equates to almost 15 per cent of an adult life in the UK, estimated to be 62 years. Time wasted: British adults spend nine years of their life watching television, three years of which is wasted on 'rubbish' programmes and repeats . This is five times longer than the 650 days which is the combined time people spend shopping, playing sport, and having sex, over their lives. Depressingly, of the nine years spent viewing TV - 16 months is spent watching repeats and two years is wasted watching ""rubbish television"" by audiences own admission. The findings state peak viewing time is over the Christmas period when the average adult will spend five and a half hours per day watching television. Half that time will be viewing repeats but researchers say that man viewers do not mind at this time of year. More than three quarters make a point of watching the same festive film every year - with Home Alone named the favourite. People spend more time watching TV than doing other things like shopping . The boom in TV viewing has come at a cost - ten per cent of families say they now have every single meal while watching television. Research by media regulator Ofcom found that pensioners are leading the rise in time spent in front of the TV. It found the over 65's are now watching 5.8 hours of television a day, while those aged 55-64 watch 5.3 hours a day. This compared to 4.8 and 4.4 hours in 2002, The rise in digital channels, which mean there are more options to watch, and improvements in technology have helped fuel the boom. In its report, Ofcom said: 'Technological developments have provided more choice, greater control and better viewing experiences on the TV set. 'TV has evolved over the past decade and it has helped to retain viewers.' Around 96 per cent of UK households now have access to digital television, which means a minimum of 50 channels. Blinkbox commissioned One Poll to investigate viewing habits. For the purposes of the survey it has classed an adult life in the UK as between 18 and 80.","British adults spend nine years of their life watching TV .

"Lance Armstrong's longtime coach Johan Bruyneel was banned for 10 years on Tuesday for helping organize widespread doping by the former seven-time Tour de France winner's cycling teams. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency announced the verdicts of an American Arbitration Association panel against Bruyneel and two medical staff. Bruyneel 'was at the apex of a conspiracy to commit widespread doping on the (U.S. Postal Service) and Discovery Channel teams spanning many years and many riders,' USADA said in a statement. Team doctor Pedro Celaya and trainer Jose 'Pepe' Marti will serve eight-year bans, USADA said. Banned: Johan Bruyneel, left, the former team manager of Lance Armstrong, right, has been banned from any participation in cycling for 10 years . Bruyneel claimed he, Armstrong and the others have been made scapegoats for an era when doping was 'a fact of life' in cycling. 'I do not dispute that there are certain elements of my career that I wish had been different,' Bruyneel said in a statement. 'However, a very small minority of us has been used as scapegoats for an entire generation.' As a Belgian national, Bruyneel questioned USADA's right to prosecute him and said he would consider appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland. Bruyneel, Celaya and Marti faced charges including trafficking and administering doping products and methods, including EPO, blood transfusions, testosterone, human growth hormone and cortisone. The ruling said Bruyneel had encouraged riders to cheat. Shut out: Former US Postal Service team manager Johan Bruyneel (right) claims he is paying for 'the sins of an era' after Belgian is handed 10-year ban from sport . The verdicts followed a four-day hearing in London last December before a three-member AAA panel. 'The panel found that Bruyneel himself 'profited considerably from the successes of the teams and riders he managed during the relevant period,' the USADA statement said. Bruyneel refused to testify and 'presented no fact witnesses on his own behalf,' USADA said. Marti also refused to testify, while Celaya was cross examined and found by the panel not to be a credible witness, the agency said. Bruyneel is banned from working in all sports through June 11, 2022. Celaya and Marti's sanctions end on June 11, 2020. The sanctions date from June 2012 when USADA accused Armstrong and his teams of widespread doping after a lengthy investigation. Shut out: Lance Armstrong's former cycling team manager Johan Bruyneel, right, doctor Pedro Celaya and trainer Jose Pepe Marti have all been handed long bans from sport for their involvement in doping . Armstrong was stripped several weeks later of all his post-August 1998 race results, including all seven Tour titles, and banned for life by USADA. Doctors Michele Ferrari and Luis Garcia del Moral also did not challenge USADA's findings and lifetime bans. In October 2012, USDA published its detailed verdict with hundreds of pages of evidence documenting the doping conspiracy, including witness statements from several Armstrong teammates. At Bruyneel's closed-door hearing in London, 17 witness provided testimony, including eight cyclists, USADA said. Celaya was doctor for the USPS/Discovery Channel team from 1997-98 and from 2004-07. He returned to work with Bruyneel at RadioShack Nissan Trek as the USADA investigation continued. Marti worked for Bruyneel from 1999 to 2007, and then with the Astana team. USADA said that Marti worked 'most recently' for the Denmark-based Team Saxo Bank-Tinkoff Bank team, which is managed by 1996 Tour winner Bjarne Riis.","Former doctor and trainer are handed eight-year-bans .

"Her children’s novels were cinematic blockbusters but JK Rowling has decided her first book for adults will be made in to a TV series. BBC1 will adapt The Casual Vacancy into a multi-million pound series, expected to be broadcast in 2014. The tome, which lays bare the darker side of life in a seemingly idyllic English village, was only released in September but has already sold more than one million copies. Scroll down for video . TV time: JK Rowling's first book for adults, The Casual Vacancy, will be adapted by BBC1 into a multi-million pound series, expected to be broadcast in 2014 . Miss Rowling said she believed the novel was ideal for the small screen and will “collaborate closely” with the BBC on the project. She said: ‘I always felt that, if it were to be adapted, this novel was best suited to television and I think the BBC is the perfect home. I’m thrilled that the BBC has commissioned The Casual Vacancy.’ The series is being made by the production arm of her agent Neil Blair, who runs literary firm The Blair Partnership. It is understood BBC1 controller Danny Cohen has been in negotiations with Blair to secure the book for the corporation. Suited to TV: Miss Rowling said if adapted she always thought that the BBC was the 'perfect home' The length of the series has yet to be confirmed but high quality drama traditionally costs in excess of £700,000 an hour in the UK. The Casual Vacancy is set in Pagford, a quintessentially British village, depicts a Britain at war and featuring episodes of rape, racism, and drug use. Danny Cohen said: ‘J.K. Rowling’s story-telling is of course peerless in its popularity, and I am looking forward to collaborating with her. This project highlights the ability of modern television to attract the world’s biggest talent and most exciting creative ideas . The Casual Vacancy sold 125,000 copies in its first week on the market, becoming the fastest-selling hardback in the UK for three years and the second biggest seller since records began in 1998. But, it had a mixed response from critics when it was first released in September. The Guardian said it was “unadventurous” with a “righteous social message”, while The Times said Miss Rowling had a “sharp eye for vivid detail”. Daily Mail writer Jan Moir described it as: ‘500 pages of relentless socialist manifesto, masquerading as literature, crammed down your throat.’ Industry insiders estimate her deal to write books for adults with publishers Little Brown is worth more than £5million. Miss Rowling is estimated to be worth in excess £530million following the success of Harry Potter.","BBC1 will adapt The Casual Vacancy into a TV series .

"Two BBC executives could face the sack over the botched Newsnight investigation that falsely linked Lord McAlpine to child abuse allegations. The reputation of Newsnight hit a new low last night after a damning report accused the flagship BBC2 programme of failing to carry out ‘basic checks’ on its report. Disciplinary proceedings began as soon . the report was delivered to the new BBC management and the BBC Trust, which could result in a decision to sack those responsible. Adrian van Klaveren, right, could be in the firing line along with Newsnight's acting editor Liz Gibbons, left, following their involvement in the show . Both Liz Gibbons, Newsnight's acting . editor, and Adrian Van Klaveren, the supervising executive seconded from . his job running Radio 5 Live, were involved with the broadcast and . could be in the firing line. BBC Scotland director, Ken . MacQuarrie, was given the job of heading the investigation and ruled . there had been an ‘unacceptable’ failure to properly establish the . veracity of the allegations. In addition, a ‘highly complex’ investigation had been commissioned and screened in a matter of five . days but no one appeared to know who was in overall charge , the . internal inquiry found. The November 2 report had focused on . historical allegations of abuse at a children’s home and featured two . victims alleging a leading Conservative politician from the Thatcher era . had been among the abusers. Catalyst: The crisis for Lord McAlpine was all started by Newsnight's 'shabby' investigation into abuse at a Welsh children's home . Falsely implicated: Pictured left, Lord McAlpine, whose name was smeared because of errors in the programme and right, Ken MacQuarrie, whose investigation shows basic checks were neglected . The politician was not named in the . programme but the coverage prompted a storm on Twitter, with many . inaccurately naming Lord McAlpine as the perpetrator. The peer was forced to issue a . statement denying his involvement, and one of the victims later said the . person who abused him was not the person he had identified as Lord . McAlpine. MacQuarrie’s report said editorial . failings on that Newsnight included the fact that: ‘Identification of . the alleged perpetrator was not confirmed by photograph with the first . victim. The second victim could not be traced in order to provide up to date corroboration.’ It added that no ‘right of reply’ was offered to the unnamed individual at the centre of the investigation. MacQuarrie outlined a serious of issues that contributed to the broadcast of the inaccurate edition of Newsnight. He stated a ‘highly complex’ story went to air very quickly, suggesting not enough time was set aside to properly research it. It was commissioned on October 28 and was then aired on November 2. The BBC worked with the Bureau of . Investigative Journalism on the story, but took ultimate editorial . responsibility once it was commissioned. MacQuarrie said the programme’s . management structure had been ‘seriously weakened’ because editor Peter . Rippon had stood aside pending an investigation into the shelving of the . Newsnight investigation into allegations of child abuse against Jimmy . Savile. Paying the price: Steve Messham's evidence formed part of the botched programme which resulted in George Entwistle's resignation . A deputy editor had also left the programme – and so the remainder of the team were under ‘very considerable pressure’. He also found that because it was . not clear if this programme was ‘regarded as Savile-related’, there was . confusion over who took ultimate responsibility for the report. This is because the BBC had been . operating a two-tier system with one set of executives in charge of . output relating to Savile, and another set in charge of day-to-day . programming. He said: ‘There was a different . understanding by the key parties about where the responsibility lay for . the final editorial sign-off for the story on the day.’ A BBC Trust spokesman said: ‘It is . clear from the MacQuarrie report on the November 2 Newsnight that there . were serious failures in the normal checks and balances that the Trust . expects from BBC journalism.’ The corporation said it was now . reverting to a ‘single chain of command’ on all output – Savile related . or otherwise – and was installing Karen O’Connor as acting editor of . Newsnight.

"Crackdown: An 18 certificate will no longer be sufficient to protect some viewers from sexually deprived and barbaric films with some set to be banned or have scenes cut . Sexually violent horror films will finally face a crackdown by censors over fears they distort the way teenage boys view women. The ‘long overdue’ decision comes following research which found widespread public concern over the increasing number of sexually depraved and barbaric films being fed to British audiences. The British Board of Film Classification has announced it will tighten guidelines over such films which will see more banned, or scenes cut from the content to protect vulnerable viewers. Vivienne Pattison, director of campaign group Media Watch UK, said: ‘This decision has been long overdue. ‘Films have become increasingly more violent and the regulations have allowed that to happen. ‘This is what the public wants. People are saying enough is enough.’ The decision follows anger last year over the release of Human Centipede II, a film which includes graphic torture, rape and mutilation. The BBFC initially banned the film but then agreed to reverse the decision if  significant cuts were made. Campaign groups welcomed yesterday’s move, branding such films as ‘torture porn’ which dehumanise victims of rape and violence. David Cooke, director of the BBFC, said that there is no 'one size fits all rule' when it comes to classifying films, but Judy Reith, director of Parenting People says that anything that protects children and enables parents to manage what their children are viewing is a 'supportive move' Barbaric: The British Board of Film Classification has announced its decision to tighten guidelines following uproar last year over the release of the Human Centipede II, pictured, which was initially banned . The report by the BBFC found: ‘[Audiences] are concerned about young men with little experience, and more vulnerable viewers, accessing sadistic and sexually violent content, which could serve to normalise rape and other forms of violence and offer a distorted view of women.’ It found that cinema-goers supported BBFC intervention – even with films rated 18 – to remove depictions of violence on the grounds that they may be harmful. Brutal: The film Antichrist by director and screenwriter Lars von Trier, pictured, was criticised for featuring scenes of genital mutilation . Viewers were particularly worried about films which make scenes of sexual or sadistic violence look appealing, which could reinforce the suggestion that victims enjoy rape. The research is all the more potent in the age of internet, where youngsters can access 18-rated content online without having to prove their age. The BBFC concluded its policy did not ‘capture all the issues’ and as a result has strengthened its guidelines for films by including a list of ‘indicators’ it has to assess the film against before suggesting cuts or classification. David Cooke, director of the BBFC, said: ‘There is no “one size fits all” rule for any theme under the BBFC classification guidelines, as long as what is depicted is within the law and does not pose a harm risk. ‘Once again the public have told us that context, tone and impact, and a work’s overall message, can aggravate a theme, or make it acceptable, even in cases of sexual and sadistic violence. ‘The decision as to whether and how to intervene in scenes of sexual and sadistic violence is complex, but drawing out and applying these aggravating and mitigating factors is helpful in arriving at a decision which balances freedom of expression against public protection.’ In recent years there has been a trend for increasingly dark, violent and sexually violent films including Lars Von Triers’ Antichrist, which had scenes of genital mutilation. There has also been Michael Winterbottom’s The Killer Inside Me, which depicts brutal violence against women, and Wolf Creek, which showed rape, torture and crucifixion. Mrs Pattinson added: ‘We know that it is easy for youngsters to access this kind of material, either via DVD or streaming it online. They are vulnerable to this content. I have issues with films like The Human Centipede. They are dehumanising the victims and treating them as lumps of meat.’ Graphic: Wolf Creek features scenes of rape, torture and crucifixion while The Killer Inside Me shows violence against women . Judy Reith, director of parenting organisation Parenting People, added: ‘Anything that protects children and enables parents to manage what their children are seeing is a supportive move. ‘Violent material can frighten people, it can make people curious and it can make them feel that something like that is acceptable for one person to do to another. ‘It’s important to keep that regulation in there to protect impressionable minds.’ The BBFC has banned only two films in the past three years – The Bunny Game and Grotesque, because both featured ‘sexual sadism’ for its own sake. It said that giving either film a rating would involve a ‘risk of harm’ to viewers. The BBFC rejects films only rarely, preferring to give advice about how appropriate cuts would achieve the preferred certificate. If a film is banned it means it cannot be released in the UK and showing or supplying it is illegal.","The British Board of Film Classification has announced it will tighten guidelines which will see more films banned .

"Britain is the world leader in the use of mobile internet, thanks to an explosion in smartphone sales, social media, online videos and music downloads. We have even overtaken tech-savvy Japan in mobile internet use, according to figures from media regulator Ofcom, which has compared data from 17 of the world's most developed nations. A report released today shows UK consumers download a record 424 megabytes of data each every month, an astonishing 60% jump from 2011. On the move: Britain's obsession with checking our Facebook and Twitter profiles on the go has seen it become the world leader in mobile internet use . Telly addicts: UK consumers use more online TV catch up services than any other nation, and increasingly use mobile devices to access them . Much of the rise is down to our heavy use of Facebook and Twitter. A total of 40% of UK adults check their profiles on their phones, rising to 62% among 18-24-year-olds. There has also been a spike in the use of on-demand TV services such as BBC iPlayer and Channel 4's 4OD. A quarter of all Brits now use them to watch their favourite shows every week, well ahead of second-placed America, where 17 per cent tune in on their phones, laptops and tablets. However, total time spent online has dropped from 746 minutes a week in the last report to 728 minutes. Australia dominates in sheer volume of hours on the net, with 992 minutes a week. Britain is also a nation of internet shopaholics with the average consumer spending more than £1,000-a-year on the web. Internet shopping is now more popular in the UK than any other major country in the world, according to the report. It found that in 2011, the average Briton spent £1,083 purchasing products online, up 14 per cent in 2010 and up 46 per cent on 2007 figures. The closest other 'big spenders' were Australians, who spend £842 per head each year, and the Swedish, who spend £747 annually. Sensation: The increasing popularity of watching Youtube on mobiles is another factor in the rise. South Korean music video Gangnam Style has nearly a billion views online . And the British are among the most likely to make internet purchases from their mobile phones. A total of 23% have visited a retail website on the move, narrowly ahead of Germany on 22.6%. James Thickett, Ofcom’s Director of Research, said that the UK’s tradition for searching for bargains through catalogue shopping, meant consumers were more open to purchasing products remotely, such as iTunes, cinema tickets, games and even clothes among the most popular purchases. He added that the country had long been one of the fastest to embrace technological change. Mr Thickett explained: ‘We have a long history of catalogue shopping in the UK, and as many daily activities are increasingly carried out online, the internet has become the new destination for many shoppers.’ Dance: The popularity of Music download sites like iTunes and Spotify have also contributed to the rise in mobile internet . In its research Ofcom also found that, more than any other nation in Europe, Britons like to shop on the move. James Murray, digital insight manager at Experian, said Christmas 2012 was on track to be another ‘record-breaker for online retail, out-stripping 2011 on all fronts’. He added: ‘The current market trends suggest that in the UK, Monday December 3 will be the biggest pre-Christmas day for online retail, with an estimated 115million visits to online retail outlets and a massive 15million hours spent online shopping on this day alone.’ Experian also expects the next two Mondays to post significantly higher sales than the equivalent dates last year. British consumers will spend 375million hours shopping online in December, 32million more hours than last year, Experian says. Last year was a record-breaking year in terms of online retail. Shoppers made 2.18billion visits to retail websites and spent 343million hours shopping online. The boom in online shopping comes at a time when the British high street is still suffering because of the economic downturn. Retail chains are closing their shops at a rate of more than 30 a day across the UK as the economic downturn continues, according to research. Figures show that across the UK embattled retailers closed 32 stores a day in July and August up from 20 a day in the first six months of 2012. High-profile administrations this year of major retailers include Past Times, Clinton Cards, and Peacocks, according to the study of 500 town centres by retail industry specialist, the Local Data Company.

"Reece Elliott, 24, from South Shields, today admitted threatening to kill 'at least 200' American school children in a series of vile Facebook messages . A British internet troll caused ‘hysteria’ in America by posting messages on Facebook threatening to kill hundreds of people in a school massacre, a court heard yesterday. Reece Elliott, 24, said he would drive to a school in Tennessee and ‘kill at least 200 before I kill myself’. He suggested someone should call police because ‘I’m on my way’. Yesterday, after a judge warned Elliott he faces a jail term, his girlfriend said: ‘He only did it for a laugh.’ The father of one, from South Shields, South Tyneside, posted the threat and other offensive comments ‘to see what kind of reaction he could provoke’, Newcastle Crown Court heard yesterday. As a result, 3,000 children were kept off school on that day in Warren County, Tennessee. Security was stepped up at schools across the area as the authorities implemented ‘lockdown’, with armed guards on duty and restricted access to schools. The Facebook threats were made at a time when tension was high in the US following the slaughter of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, last December, by gunman Adam Lanza. Elliott admitted one count of making threats to kill and eight of sending grossly offensive messages. He has been held in custody since his arrest in February and was told by Judge James Goss that a prison term was ‘inevitable’. Sentencing was adjourned for reports. Popular Caitlin Talley, who died aged 17 in a car crash last October, was a student at Warren County High School . Elliott admitted posting under a pseudonym on the tribute website - his messages sent panic through Warren County . The series of vile messages were posted on the RIP Caitlin Talley Facebook site in February this year . The FBI and Homeland Security traced . the culprit to Elliott’s mother’s address in South Shields. He had been . staying there following an argument with his girlfriend. Elliott was ‘well aware that he was . wanted’ and handed himself in to police. The threat was made on a . tribute site to 17-year-old Caitlin Talley, a popular student at Warren . County High School who was killed in a car accident last October. Using a false name, Elliott wrote: ‘My . father has three guns. I’m planning on killing him first and putting . him in a dumpster. Around 3,000 schoolchildren stayed home from school in Warren County after Elliott posted his online threats . Then I’m taking the motor and I’m going in fast. I’m . gonna kill hopefully at least 200 before I kill myself. So you want to . tell the deputy, I’m on my way.’ He also wrote vile abuse about the dead teenager. Gary Buckley, prosecuting, said of . Elliott: ‘He said he was a part-time troll. He said he decided to post . offensive comments to see what kind of reaction he could provoke. ‘He confirmed he did post the postings . on Facebook and therefore did make these threats but he didn’t expect . the threats to be taken seriously and didn’t expect them to cause the . reaction they did.’ [caption . Mr Buckley said by using the American terms ‘dumpster’ and ‘deputy’, Elliott made his threats seem more believable. Speaking after his arrest, his . girlfriend, who did not want to be named, said: ‘Reece has a child . himself, he would not hurt children. ‘He does things for a laugh on Facebook – that’s what he does.’","Reece Elliott, 24, admitted threatening to kill and sending grossly offensive messages at Newcastle Crown Court today .

"Failure: George Entwistle has admitted that it will take time to earn the audience's trust again . BBC director general George Entwistle has admitted the BBC has failed to get things right since the Savile crisis began. The executive confessed he realised it would take time to “regain the trust of the audience”. A recent poll by the corporation found public trust in it had plunged because of the revelations about Savile and its subsequent handling of them. In 2009, 62 per cent of licence fee payers said the BBC was ‘trustworthy’ but this figure has now plunged to 47 per cent. Speaking at an international conference for public broadcasters he admitted that he was 'determined' to restore the sense of pride in the BBC that viewers had during the London 2012 Olympics. He said: ‘It’s difficult to overestimate what a traumatic time the last few weeks have been for some people in the UK. And the BBC has been at the heart of the story. Jimmy Savile was a BBC entertainer. It’s become apparent that some of the assaults he carried out were on BBC premises. To BBC employees today, the idea that such things could happen is almost beyond comprehension. ‘But although many of Savile’s crimes were committed decades ago, we are inheritors of the BBC’s past. And I should be the first to admit that we haven’t got everything right since this crisis started. ‘There are no short cuts: we have to acknowledge responsibility; apologise to victims; commit ourselves to finding out what happened; and cooperate as closely as possible with the police.’ The BBC has set up three independent reviews in the wake of the paedophilia revelations, one to establish why a Newsnight investigation into the scandal was shelved, another to look back at the culture and practices during Savile’s time at the BBC, and a third looking at processes for reporting sexual harassment. Entwistle said the corporation had previously lost viewer trust with previous controversies such as the misleading trailer for a documentary featuring the Queen, and irregularities over BBC-run phone-in competitions, but had managed to regain it. Entwistle apologised again to the victims of Jimmy Savile's abuse. He admitted that since the start of the scandal, the corporation hadn't 'got anything right' He explained: ‘During editorial troubles in the last decade – there was a marked falling off in trust from our audiences. Because they set the highest standards for us, they rightly feel more keenly disappointed when we fail to measure up. ‘Yet, even when the public felt most let down, they still believed that the BBC could be trusted to put things right itself. And we did. The rigour and honesty with which the BBC handled past crises renewed our audiences’ confidence in us. My determination is that we accomplish this again.’ Entwistle re-iterated his public apology to the victims of Savile’s abuse and said the broadcaster was working with children’s charities to provide the best possible support for those affected. His speech comes after Entwistle faces accusations it took him, or his office, three weeks to contact police about a letter he received containing allegations Jimmy Savile abused children on BBC premises. Untrustworthy: George Entwistle highlighted that the BBC had made mistakes before yet managed to re-earn people's trust . A letter was sent from ITV on September 7 containing details of allegations it would be making on its Exposure programme, which first revealed the extent of Savile’s abuse. But the BBC did not contact police or begin its own investigation until early October, when details of the content of the ITV programme were made public. The conclusions of the Pollard Review, looking into the axed Newsnight investigation, are expected to be delivered by the end of the month.","47% of licence fee payers label BBC 'trustworthy', down from 63% in 2009 .

"BBC chairman Lord Patten yesterday admitted the corporation was ‘over-managed’ by a vast number of highly paid, jargon-spouting bureaucrats. And despite overseeing a shambolic period encompassing the Lord McAlpine scandal and subsequent departure of director general George Entwistle, Lord Patten hinted he would consider another term in his £110,000-a-year part-time role – which he described as ‘exciting’. ‘I am 68. I hadn’t thought the job would be as exciting as it turned out to be. I would like to help the BBC face up to a digital future,’ he told the annual Voice of the Listener and Viewer conference. Admission: Lord Patten yesterday admitted the corporation was 'over managed' He also batted away suggestions that . he did not give the BBC enough attention because he has ten other jobs, . claiming he worked more than the three to four days a week his contract . stipulates. But Lord Patten, who was appointed last year on a four-year contract, conceded the BBC is ‘both over-managed and under-managed’. He said: ‘The tendency towards over-management comes from the sheer . weight and numbers of senior people, their pay, their titles, their . jargon. ‘I worry that this means those at the top of the organisation can become . distracted – diverted from the job in hand and the central question of . whether the programmes are good enough. ‘This will be a fairly familiar concern to BBC-watchers and is often . frustrating for our friends. We’re on the case, progress is being made, . but we need to do more. The lack of a clear line of responsibility and . co-operation between senior executives were problems of . ‘under-management’ and there needed to be more ‘self-criticism’, he . added. Lord Patten also defended Mr Entwistle, who was forced to resign after . just 54 days in the job when Newsnight wrongly linked former Tory . treasurer Lord McAlpine to a child abuse inquiry in North Wales. Friends have expressed concern for the 50-year-old, who was photographed . looking bearded, drawn and a little dishevelled yesterday as he gave . evidence to the independent inquiry investigating Newsnight’s decision . to axe a programme about the Jimmy Savile child abuse scandal last year. Visiting lawyers: Former BBC Director General George Entwistle, left, arrives at a London solicitors office which is the venue of the BBC's Pollard Review . Lord Patten said: ‘Given everything that went wrong, it was the right . thing for him to go when he did. But that should in no way justify the . way his reputation is now being traduced. I don’t agree with character . assassinations.’ He added that Mr Entwistle had been wrongly depicted as a ‘hapless and . inadequate figure’ and his reputation, built up over ‘23 years of . outstanding service’ to the BBC had been ‘trashed’. It is expected that former head of Sky News Nick Pollard, who is running the inquiry, will reach his conclusions in December. The corporation is ‘assisting’ with the legal fees of BBC staff involved . in the inquiry, including Newsnight editor Peter Rippon, head of news . Helen Boaden, and her deputy Stephen Mitchell. Alan Maclean QC, the barrister who represented Tony Blair and Alastair . Campbell during the Hutton Inquiry, is advising Mr Pollard and is . estimated to be able to charge around a £1,000 a day for his services. Bearded: The £500,000 payout George Entwistle has received for leaving his position with the BBC does not seem to have been spent on grooming products . Lord Patten commented: ‘The Pollard Inquiry has been thorough and as a . consequence it has been expensive. ‘Like the Leveson Inquiry, it will only be worth the expense if we can . act decisively to make clear improvements on the back of it.’ ‘Once we get the Pollard report, it will I hope be much clearer to the Trust what went wrong and how. ‘There may well be consequences for some of the individuals involved. We . will then need to roll our sleeves up and work alongside the new . director general to put things right.’ Royal Opera House chief executive Tony Hall will take over the role in March. Tim Davie will continue as acting director general until then. A BBC Trust spokesman said: 'Lord Patten was answering a question about . whether he would agree to stay on for a second term to argue the case . for Charter renewal. 'All he replied was that he was committed to trying to restore the reputation and standing of the BBC.'","Lord Patten announced he wants to stay on as chairman of BBC Trust .

"Scotland Yard last night said they were assessing the credibility of new information relating to the deaths of Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed including an allegation that they were murdered by a member of the British military. It said it was 'scoping' the information, which surfaced in the second court martial of Sergeant Danny Nightingale, the SAS sniper convicted of illegally stashing a pistol and 338 bullets in his bedroom. The allegation was contained in a . letter from the parents-in-law of Soldier N, Sgt Nightingale's former . housemate, which was sent to the SAS's commanding officer in September 2011. Scroll down for video . Police have said they are 'assessing' information it has recently received in relation to the deaths of Princess Diana and Dodi Al Fayed . It is understood the information was passed to the Metropolitan Police through the Royal Military Police. The letter says Soldier N claimed the SAS 'was behind Princess Diana's death' and it had been 'covered up', the Sunday People has . reported. The letter said: 'He (soldier N) also told her (his wife) that it was XXX who arranged Princess Diana's death and that has been covered up.' A statement issued by Scotland Yard said: 'The Metropolitan Police Service is scoping information that has recently been received in relation to the deaths and assessing its relevance and credibility. 'The assessment will be carried out by officers from the specialist crime and operations command. 'This is not a re-investigation and does not come under Operation Paget.' Police said they are not prepared to . discuss the matter further, while a royal spokeswoman said there will be . no comment on the matter from Prince William or Prince Harry, or from . Clarence House. Police said the deaths of Diana and Mr Al Fayed were 'thoroughly investigated' and examined by an inquest led by Lord Justice Scott Baker at the Royal Court of Justice in 2007 to 2008 . Diana, . Dodi and chauffeur Henri Paul died after their Mercedes crashed in the . tunnel, which left the Ritz Hotel on the morning of August 31 1997. The hearing into the deaths of Diana and Dodi lasted more than 90 days with evidence from around 250 witnesses. The inquests concluded on April 7, . 2008, with a jury returning a verdict that the 'People's Princess' and . her boyfriend were unlawfully killed. After . the hearing, Metropolitan Police said they had spent £8 million on . services arising from the inquest and the Operation Paget investigation . from 2004 to 2006. Diana, Mr Al Fayed (pictured) and chauffeur Henri Paul died after their Mercedes crashed in a tunnel in Paris on the morning of August 31, 1997 . That money includes the cost of the legal team which represented the force's commissioner at the inquest, police protection for the inquest jury and paying for the Paget inquiry, reported to have cost £3.6 million. Former Met Police Commissioner Lord Stevens's Paget investigation was launched in 2004 at the request of Michael Burgess, the Royal Coroner, who was then overseeing the future Diana inquest. The former top policeman published his report in December 2006, rejecting the murder claims voiced by some, including Dodi's father Mohamed al Fayed. Lord Stevens's investigation found that Diana was not murdered by British spies nor by the Duke of Edinburgh and she was not pregnant nor engaged to boyfriend Dodi. Operation Paget concluded, just like the French investigation in 1999, that driver Henri Paul was drunk and driving at excessive speed. The investigation dismissed the endless conspiracy theories sparked by the fatal accident. Mr Paul had an alcohol level of around 1.74 grams per litre at the time of the crash - about twice the British drink-drive limit. The black type S280 Mercedes was being driven through the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris at around 61 to 63mph - twice the speed limit for that section of road. Lord Stevens said allegations that Diana was murdered were 'unfounded' and that he found nothing to justify further inquiries with members of the Royal Family. A spokesman for Mr al Fayed yesterday said he had . no comment to make, but said he will be 'interested in seeing the . outcome', adding that he trusts the Met will investigate the information . 'with vigour'. The Ministry of Defence said tonight it was not commenting on the matter. The jury in the 2008 inquest concluded its verdict as 'unlawful killing, grossly negligent driving of the following vehicles and of the Mercedes', the Met said .

October 2003 - Three photographers who snapped pictures of Diana and Dodi at the crash scene go on trial in Paris accused of invading the couple's privacy. They are cleared a month later. November 2003 - A privacy violation civil case, brought by Mr Fayed against three of the photographers who were following the Princess's car on the night she died, . Lord Stevens released his report after three years of investigation - it concludes the couple and their chauffeur died in a traffic accident in a Paris underpass in August 1997 . January 6, 2004 – Separate inquests into Diana and Dodi’s deaths are finally opened and adjourned.

He is later replaced by Britain’s top female judge Lady Butler- Sloss . December 2006 - Lord Stevens finally releases his report after three years of investigation – it finds that there was no conspiracy to murder the Princess lover and no cover-up afterwards. Instead it concludes that the couple and their chauffeur Henri Paul died in a simple traffic accident in a Paris underpass in August 1997. Lord Stevens stressed that if the Princess had been wearing a seatbelt she might have survived the crash.","Police 'scoping information' and 'assessing its relevance and credibility'

"Once upon a time, they would have played with train sets, dolls and cuddly toys. Today’s toddlers, however, are more likely to be playing with an iPad - and are becoming adept at using the internet long before they start school. Nearly half of three and four-year-olds are now technologically-savvy, a report by media watchdog Ofcom revealed yesterday. Hi-tech toddlers: A study by media watchdog Ofcom found 37 per cent of children aged three and four accessed the internet via a laptop or PC . And one in ten is already using an iPad to visit websites, watch films and television programmes and play games. The report marks the first time the regulator has looked at the habits of the pre-school age group – and the findings prompted experts to warn parents not to use computers and tablets as ‘virtual babysitters’. The study also found that under-13s, many of whom are too young to legitimately register for social networks without parental consent, are befriending strangers on these websites. Cyber-bullying also emerged as a persistent problem, with more girls than boys being targeted. As part of the study, researchers interviewed 200 families with children aged three and four. They found 37 per cent of these children used the internet via a PC or laptop – and 3 per cent even surfed the web using a mobile phone. The youngsters also watched around 15.5 hours of television a week and spent 6.2 hours a week playing games online – but no figures were collected for the time they spent surfing the web. Claudio Pollack of Ofcom warned: ‘Children are not just using more media, they are also adopting some forms at a very young age. ‘This highlights the challenge that some parents face in keeping up with their children when it comes to technology and in understanding what they can do to protect children.’ 'Virtual babysitter': 80 per cent of youngsters in their early teens have a social networking profile, the study found . Child psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos urged parents to supervise children when they are using the web and to allow internet use only ‘in moderation’. She added: ‘Children need balance. Using games and websites online can stimulate younger children. There are some wonderful learning tools out there. ‘But it comes down to supervising what they are doing. We know it is bad to dump children in front of the TV. It is going to be the same with computers and tablets. Parents shouldn’t use the internet as a virtual babysitter. Parents must make sure they are aware of what their children are looking at.’ Ofcom also polled 1,700 children on their use of social networking sites and found that many are still chatting to strangers online, despite a number of campaigns warning of the dangers. Under-13s, many of whom are  supposedly too young to sign up without parental consent, are  managing to find their way on to these sites and befriending people they do not know. The report found that 22 per cent of eight- to 11-year-olds have a social networking profile and have  typically amassed 92 friends – but 12 per cent of these are people they have never met. The figure rises for those in their early teens, with 80 per cent saying they have a social networking profile with an average of 286 friends. Shockingly, among 12- to 15-year-olds up to a quarter of these ‘friends’ are strangers. The report also warned that advances in online gaming meant it was possible for children to be contacted by strangers from around the world. It found that one in three boys in their early teens admitted playing games online with people who are not known to them. Cyber-bullying remains a problem, with one in ten internet users aged 12 to 15 saying they have experienced it in the past year. Around 13 per cent of girls this age have personal experience of being bullied online, compared to five per cent of boys. Ofcom’s report said that almost half of parents admitted their ‘child knew more about the internet’ then they did, adding: ‘Lack of confidence in using the internet is an issue for a number of parents.’","Almost half of three and four-year-olds are now technologically savvy, according to a report from media watchdog Ofcom .
One in ten is already using an iPad to visit websites, play games and watch TV and films, study found .
Report has prompted experts to warn parents not to use computers as 'virtual babysitters'"
