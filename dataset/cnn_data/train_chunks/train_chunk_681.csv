The wife of an ex-Lehman Brothers hotshot who is accused of biting, kicking and pulling the hair of his estranged wife inside their lavish Manhattan co-op, has testified against her husband in his assault trial. David Milberg, 50, who was vice president at the failed bank and now runs a private investment firm, is on trial for attempted assault after the alleged incident in April of this year. The violent fight between finance exec David Milberg, 50, . and his wife of 16 years, Melinda, occurred while their 14-year-old . daughter was home, Melinda said. ‘He let out an almost animalistic . grunt and sunk his teeth into my flesh,’ Melinda Milberg testified at  Manhattan Supreme Court. ‘He started to grind his teeth into my flesh and then he released his . bite.’ Set for trial: Ex-Lehman Brothers vice president, David Milberg, left, is accused of biting, kicking and pulling the hair of his estranged wife, Melinda Milberg, right, inside their lavish Manhattan co-op in April . Armed: Melinda Milberg, 50, said when cops arrived she told them her husband David had bruised her arm and forehead, tore a nail and bit her arm. David confessed to cops. 'I fell into a trap, this is what she wanted' During testimony in Manhattan Supreme Court, Mrs Milberg said the confrontation . continued in their spacious apartment on West End Avenue on Manhattan’s . Upper West Side as she desperately tried to escape her enraged husband’s . grasp. Their teenage daughter Beverly then came into the room and yelled at her father to stop. ‘She . was screaming at him. She was yelling, ‘Dad, stop it! Dad, what the . hell are you doing? Dad, what’s wrong with you? Dad, are you crazy?’’ Melinda testified. Melinda then ‘ran into the master bedroom’ where . David pursued her and grabbed hold of her again, yanked her hair and . threatened her, she testified. She said, 'he used both of his hands to forcefully push . me onto a chair... causing bruising and substantial pain.' Melinda . Milberg, 50, told authorities she 'then observed (my husband) grab me . by the hair and strike my head against the chair multiple times... causing my hair to come out of my head.' Alleged abuse: Melinda Milberg, 50, pictured, told authorities she 'then observed (my husband) grab me by the hair and strike my head against the chair multiple times... causing my hair to come out of my head' ‘He gritted his teeth and uttered: ‘I . am going to kill you! I am going to kill you!' And gestured at me with . his hands and got right in my face,’ Milberg said . The court was then played the 911 call of Mrs Milberg calling the police . ‘Get away! Get away! Get away!’ she shrieked. ‘Are the police on their way? My husband’s killing me! Prosecutors then replayed the scene to the courtroom. ‘She . sat pinned in the chair as the defendant grabbed her arm and sunk his . teeth into her arm,’ Assistant District Attorney Timothy Duda said in . opening arguments on Thursday morning. In his defense, David . Milberg’s lawyers say she provoked him and that his biting on her arm . was simply an instant reaction after she lunged at him. His lawyer, Celia Gordon, made it clear where Mr Milberg's position lay. Bitter battle: Melinda Milberg, 50, said on the witness stand Thursday at Manhattan Supreme Court that her estranged husband, finance exec David Milberg, bit her in a violent confrontation at their upper West Side home in April . ‘She is a vindictive liar, and it is our great pleasure to see to it that she is finally exposed,’ The banker . allegedly admitted to police as he was arrested that he 'bit her arm' but insisted 'I fell into a trap. This is what she wanted. The . couple had split in January and Mrs Milberg officially filed for . divorce in March but were taking turns living in the Upper West Side pad . with the children until April. When not with the kids, the other spouse . would live in a hotel, Mr Gottlieb told MailOnline. He said that on April 1, Mr Milberg had returned to his home and told his wife he was fed up with the housing arrangement. Vindictive liar? IN this video that was shown to the court, Mrs Milberg (in green) is seen in the same gym as her husband. She told prosecutors that they were 'face-to-face' but it appears that the couple barely noticed one another . Overreaction? Soon after her husband walked by, Mrs Milberg called the cops and alerted JCC gym security. They determined that her husband was fine to be there also . During . cross-examination, Melinda Milberg was questioned the couple’s divorce . and her rejection of a settlement that would have given her full . ownership of their high-priced pad, a new Mercedes, $5 million in cash, . private school and camp tuitions for their three kids through college, . over $100,000 in child support annually. The court was also shown a . video during which David Milberg walks by his wife Melinda outside the . gym as she sorts things out on a bench. Mrs Milberg told authorities . that her husband was ‘face-to-face’ with her at the the Jewish . Community Center gym, but the video shows that he doesn't appear to look . in her direction. He had been ordered by a court to stay away. She called the police and and alerted JCC staff but her estranged husband was not arrested and was allowed to be there. Scene: The husband allegedly roughed up his wife at their posh Upper West Side co-op, pictured . But Mr Milberg's lawyer insists his wife trumped up the accusations to win leverage in the couple's nasty, multimillion divorce case. Mr Gottlieb told MailOnline: 'David is absolutely innocent of those absurd charges. This case is simply about a woman who has manipulated the police the District Attorney and is now trying to manipulate the courts for the sole purpose of getting money in the matrimonial case.' He said the divorce proceedings started before Mr Milberg's arrest. 'These charges were just part of her strategy to gain leverage in her quest for money,' Mr Gottlieb said earlier this week. Fight: In the split, the couple are fighting over custody as well as access to a 400-acre country club - Sunningdale in Westchester, New York, pictured, of which they are members . Mr Gottlieb would not say exactly how much Mrs Milberg was going for in the divorce but said it was a 'significant' sum, adding 'she has refused to settle it while the criminal case was pending.' In the split, the couple are fighting over custody as well as access to a 400-acre country club - Sunningdale in Westchester, New York, of which they are members. 'Mrs Milberg's shenanigans and her abuse of the system has resulted in David having very little contact with the children,' Mr Gottlieb said. The kids are aged 14, 10 and eight. David Aronson, Mr Milberg's divorce lawyer, told the New York Daily News the estranged couple could both be 'at the country club at the same time as long as Mr Milberg understands he has to stay away from his wife and not approach her and not speak to her.' But Mrs Milberg's attorney told the newspaper that was inconceivable as the possibility of seeing their father at the posh club was 'really a frightening thought' to the couple's children.","David Milberg, 50, was vice president at the failed bank and is on trial for attempted assault .

President Obama's trade representative has reversed a ban on imports of Apple iPad 2 and iPhone 4, overturning a decision by the International Trade Commission banning the imports. The ban on the Apple products from sale in the U.S. was originally instated by the ITC in June because Apple had violated Samsung patents on wireless technology. Following the ITC decision, the Obama administration had 60 days to decide if it would uphold the commission. U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman overruled the decision based on the type patent at issue in the Apple case. Write caption here . Patent dispute: The patent at issue in the case for banning several Apple products belongs to Samsung . Froman wrote that the administration feared a ban would give patent holders 'undue leverage' over competitors when attempting to license new technologies and has recommended that the ITC's power to impose import bans in similar cases. It was the first time since 1987 a product ban like this had been overturned by an administration. Meanwhile, Apple and Samsung are embroiled in a legal battle over smartphone technologies. Samsung is accusing Apple of infringing its patents on the iPhone and iPad products that were almost subject to a ban, while Apple is arguing that Samsung's Android phones copy iPhone features. Samsung said in a statement late Saturday night that it was disappointed . in Froman's ruling, saying the ITC 'correctly recognized that Samsung . has been negotiating in good faith, and that Apple remains unwilling to . take a license.' Overruled: The U.S. Trade Commissioner Michael Froman, who overturned the ITC decision . In an email, Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet said the company applauded the administration 'for standing up for innovation.' Companies license patented technology to competitors so the devices can communicate as part of an industry standard for cellphones. Under the 'standards-essential patent' legal theory prevailing in federal courts, holders of such patents are obligated to license them to all comers on 'fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory' terms.Last year, a federal court ruled that Samsung owed Apple $1 billion in damages for infringing on non-essential Apple patents. But the judge refused to impose an import ban on Samsung phones and later struck $450 million from the verdict, saying the jurors miscalculated. The case is set for a rematch in appeals court. Samsung is the world's largest maker of smartphones. Analysts estimate it outsold Apple nearly 2 to 1 in the first three months of the year. However, Apple's smartphone business is more profitable . The iPhone 4 was launched in 2010 and is the oldest iPhone still sold by Apple. The ITC ruling applied only to the AT&T version of the phone. Apple is likely to retire the model. Apple launched the iPad 2 in 2011. The ruling applies only to the version equipped with a cellular modem for AT&T's network.","A ban on Apple products set to begin today was overturned by the Obama administration .

Tragedy: William Avery-Wright died as he crossed a road outside his school on the way to play rugby . A 13-year-old private school pupil shouted 'Oh my God' before a Land Rover knocked him down as he crossed a main road to play rugby, an inquest has heard. William Avery-Wright and a school friend were left to cross the 60mph-limit main road on their own because they were running late for a match, a coroner was told. The sporty teenager, who played golf . at county level, was pronounced dead from multiple injuries at East . Surrey Hospital in Redhill, Surrey, on November 30, 2011. His friend told police that William froze and said 'Oh my God' before the Defender hit him outside the £30,000-a-year school. The boy’s parents are suing Worth School in Crawley, West Sussex, claiming teachers should have supervised him crossing the road. They are also angry that the school announced the tragic news on its website before his devastated father had even been informed of the death crash. Insurance broker Chistopher Avery-Wright  found out about the tragedy when he started to receive texts and emails of condolence from people who had seen the message while he was being driven to hospital by police. The Roman Catholic school has said it acted in 'good faith' and incorrectly thought both parents had been informed when it published the tribute. The inquest in Crawley first heard from Graham Voller, the driver of the Land Rover Defender which struck William. He said he was driving at around 40mph in the 60mph zone with his grand-daughter in the passenger seat at the time of the crash. Distraught: Christopher Avery-Wright (pictured with William) started receiving messages of condolence before he had been informed of his son's death . Message: How the website of Worth School in Sussex announced William's death - before his father had been told . He said: 'I got to a short distance of . the crossing and through the side window I just saw someone on the side . of the road. I only saw one (person). 'And then the young lad just arrived . in front of the Land Rover. Just as the boy hit the Land Rover I did an . emergency stop. I had little time to react. 'When I stopped, I got out of the Land Rover and looked to see the boy, and got straight on to the mobile phone.' Mr Voller will not face criminal charges over the crash, which happened on a road he said he travelled on up to 15 times a day. Coroner Bridget Dolan heard that the boy who was with William when he . was struck described in a statement to police how he 'froze' and that . the crash had left him feeling a sense of 'disbelief'. Talent: Keen sportsman William Avery-Wright died aged 13 . He told how they were going to play a . school rugby match which required them crossing a road, and that they . were running late. The boy mentioned to William that his . sock was down. He told police: 'I was looking at my shoe and then after . two seconds, I looked up at Will. He was on the pavement. 'I saw him running and stop, and (he) said, ‘Oh my God’, and then the whole thing happened.' He added: 'I didn’t see the car before it all happened.' The boy later added that he thought . William was 'in the middle' of running and walking at the time of the . crash. The boy said he had crossed the road before without adult . supervision and that he had not been made to wait for a teacher to help . him across. Alan Mitchell, a teacher at Worth . School who had overall responsibility for the games department, faced . questions about the school’s policy on safe road crossing for pupils. Under the school’s rules, he said . students in Years 7 and 8 had to have adult supervision when crossing . the road. William was in Year 8. Questioned by the Avery-Wrights’ solicitor, Mr Mitchell said the policies did not state what should . happen if a student is late. He added: 'I would’ve expected them to go . to games staff or a member of the house.' Mr Mitchell said the policy was . communicated to pupils via the bursar who would give them a health and . safety talk at the start of the year. And he said staff would be . expected to read policies. William was a day pupil at the school, where he excelled in rugby, cricket, football and golf. The hearing continues.

A Carnival cruise ship has failed a health inspection after dead flies, leaking brown water and a cockroach 'nymph' were found on board, according to a report published this week. Inspectors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) made a surprise visit to the boat on February 21 and found numerous failings from food galleys to service stations and at the swimming pools. Fascination was scored 84 out of 100 - any grade of 85 or lower is considered a fail. Troubled: The Carnival Fascination pictured in Key West, Florida on February 18 - days before it was inspected . Among the many complaints from CDC inspectors was that there was not enough chlorine in swimming pools and there were no 'sneeze shields' in front of salad bars. According to the report, an engineer on board Fascination did not follow protocol while he had acute gastroenteritis, going to the crew mess for breakfast, lunch and dinner on February 5. A Carnival spokesman told MailOnline that the company was taking aggressive action over the failings and had requested a re-inspection as soon as possible. Fascination failed its inspection in the same month that another Carnival boat, the Triumph, became stranded in  the Gulf of Mexico for five days without working toilets, power or air conditioning. Rocky: The pool area on the Carnival Fascination had not enough chlorination, the CDC found . During a recent U.S. Public Health inspection held in February, Carnival Fascination received a score of 84 out of 100 points, with 86 meeting U.S.P.H. standards. No violations were noted in the ship’s potable water systems, food handling, temperature, or production areas. Following Carnival Cruise Lines’ established policies and procedures, corrective action was taken immediately, with several issues being resolved during the inspection and all issues resolved within 24 hours of the inspection. A corrective-action report was provided to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which administers the Vessel Sanitation Program, and Carnival has requested re-inspection as soon as possible. In the past five years, no Carnival ship has failed a U.S.P.H. inspection and the fleet’s average score during that time period is 97.  The average over 20 inspections already conducted in 2013 is 97.2. The health and well-being of our guests and crew is Carnival Cruise Lines’ highest priority, and on the extremely rare occasion when one of our ships has an unsatisfactory score, we initiate immediate and aggressive corrective action. An engine fire crippled the sister ship Carnival Triumph leaving 4,200 passengers stranded at sea. The boat finally limped to shore in Mobile, Alabama on February 14 where disembarking passengers described deplorable conditions where human waste sloshed down hallways, they slept in the open air to escape the heat and smell while food supplies ran low. It is the latest in a litany of problems for the beleaguered cruise company Carnival. Last month, passengers were flown back to the U.S. from a seven-day cruise to St Maarten after they were forced to disembark the ship following 'technical issues'. A few days earlier, the company had announced that another ship, the Carnival Legend had 'a technical issue' affecting the sailing speed, forcing the cancellation of a stop in . Grand Cayman Islands.

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 09:01 EST, 12 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:21 EST, 12 August 2013 . A Chinese cargo ship is attempting to sail to Europe via an Arctic 'short-cut' that could shave almost two weeks off the journey time. Shipping firm Cosco Group's vessel the Yong Sheng, a 19,000-tonne freighter, set sail from Dalian, China, on Tuesday bound for Rotterdam, in a bid to complete the country's first ever commercial transit of the Northeast Passage over Russia. The northerly journey via the Bering Strait, which the changing climate is making possible for longer periods thanks to melting sea ice, is expected to take 35 days - compared with the 48 days it takes to complete the traditional route through the Suez Canel and the Mediterranean Sea. Historic: The Chinese vessel set sail from Dalian bound for Europe via the Northeast Passage last week . The entire Northeast Passage - also known as the Northern Sea Route - along the Russian coast lies in Arctic waters, and parts are free from ice for only two months of the year. But climate change means Arctic lanes are opening up for longer stints due to melting sea ice. It means icebreakers are no longer required under Russian rules for all Arctic route journeys, according to a report in the Financial Times. If it becomes easier to use the quicker Northeast Passage it could dramatically reduce shipping costs. There has been a boom in the number of vessels intent on sailing all or part of the passage. Russian authorities have granted 372 permits to ships this year - more than eight times the 46 full transits made in 2012. There were just four in 2010. But despite the impact of climate . change, experts say it will be some time before the Northeast Passage . rivals the Suez Canal in terms of traffic. 'Climate change is certainly opening new . Arctic shipping routes,' Cameron Dueck, a Canadian author who . sailed the Northwest Passage in 2009, told the FT. 'But the most common routes . through the [Arctic] continue to have ice even in the warmest years, . meaning shipping companies will have to be selective and opportunistic . in using them.' From China: The vessel set sail from the port of Dalian in northeastern China on Tuesday . To Europe: The crew are hoping to reach the Dutch port of Rotterdam on September 11 - a transit time of just 35 days . Valentin . Davydants, captain of Russia’s Atomflot fleet of nuclear-powered . icebreakers, estimates that 15million tonnes of cargo will use the full route by 2021. That compares to the 929million tonnes of cargo transported via the Suez Canal in 2011. 'You . might see some oil and gas leave Russia – but I think the day that . container ships will choose to use the northern sea route for economic . reasons is quite a long way off,' said one of Norway’s biggest . shipowners. The traditional route that links China to the EU threads its way through the South China Sea, the Strait of Malacca and the Indian Ocean. The Yong Sheng will take the 5,400k route via Northeast Passage, which offers a relatively straight  course over Russia. It is expected to reach Rotterdam on September 11 - a journey of just 35 days.","The Yong Sheng set sail from Dalian bound for Rotterdam last week .

Iran's new president Hasan Rouhani has accused the United States of seeking an excuse to confront the country over its nuclear programme. The new leader reportedly made the claim during a meeting with North Korean official Kim Yong Nam, who is in the Iranian capital Tehran to see Mr Rouhani's inauguration. According to Iranian state TV, the president said: 'We believe the United States and the Westerners are seeking an excuse to confront the countries that they do not consider friends.' Allegations: Iran's new president Hasan Rouhani (right) told a top North Korean official, Kim Yong Nam, that America wants an excuse to confront Iran over its nuclear programme . The West suspects Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons programme, a charge which Iran denies. Mr Rouhani, who was elected in June, has promised greater openness over the country's nuclear activities. However, he is subordinate in the country's power structure to the clerical leadership, particularly in foreign and security matters. At his inauguration earlier today, the new president was formally endorsed by Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The event, which was broadcast live on state television, saw Mr Rouhani sat cross-legged on a mat on one side of Ayatollah Khamenei, with outgoing president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on the other. Inauguration: Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei sat in the centre during the ceremony, with president-elect Hasan Rouhani on his right, and outgoing president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on his left . Mr Ahmadinejad has been a thorn in the side of Western leaders and the United Nations since he took power in 2005, thanks to hardline policies which raised frequent tensions. Speaking at the event, Mr Rouhani pledged to follow a path of moderation and work to get Western sanctions over Iran's suspect nuclear programme lifted. Iran is under United Nations sanctions as well as unilateral Western oil and banking sanctions over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment, a technology that can be used to power reactors producing electricity or build nuclear weapons. Iran says its nuclear programme is peaceful and geared towards generating electricity and producing radioisotopes to treat cancer patients. Nuclear programme: In this photo from April 2008, former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, centre, visits the Natanz Uranium Enrichment Facility . 'The government's (goal) will be to tackle people's living issues. ... In parallel, it will take new steps in the arena of international relations to improve Iran's standing on the basis of meeting national interests and remove the current oppressive sanctions,' Mr Rouhani said. The leader also announced his first appointment since taking office, in which he named a U.S.-educated businessman as his chief of staff. A Sunday report by the official IRNA news agency says Hasan Rouhani has chosen Mohammad Nahavandian, a 58-year-old businessman with a doctorate in economics from George Washington University in Washington. Mr Nahavandian's appointment is being seen as an attempt to reach out to the private sector. In this picture released by the Iranian supreme leader's office, outgoing president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad hands back the official seal of approval to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . Endorsement: Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (pictured left) gives his official seal of approval to president-elect Hasan Rouhani. Pictured right, the new president kisses the supreme leader's robe. The president's team contains figures whose academic pedigrees include institutions in California, Washington and London, while Mr Rouhani himself studied in Scotland. It remains unclear if - or how - their Western-looking credentials will influence Iranian policies or foster potential outreach diplomacy, such as direct talks with the U.S. Ayatollah Khamenei, the ultimate authority in Iran, has the final say in all key matters, including Mr Rouhani's upcoming selections for key Cabinet posts such as the foreign and intelligence ministers. During Sunday's inauguration ceremony, Mr Rouhani kissed the supreme leader's clerical robe, but avoided kissing his hand, something Mr Ahmadinejad did in 2005.

Carnival Corp has been hit with its first lawsuit over the 'horrifying' conditions passengers were forced to endure when the Triumph cruise became stranded following an engine fire. Cassie Terry of Brazoria County, Texas filed the suit less than 24 hours after arriving on dry land in Mobile, Alabama, alleging that she was forced to wade through  human feces from overflowing toilets. Her suit also claimed Carnival failed to provide a seaworthy vessel and sanitary conditions. She suffered physical and emotional harm, including anxiety, nervousness and the loss of the enjoyment of life, according to the complaint filed in federal court in Miami. Whether lawsuits will be successful has been doubted by legal analysts, who have speculated passengers will find it difficult to . sue Carnival for any damages thanks to a legal structure . shielding operators from big-money lawsuits. They're home: The Carnival Triumph cruise ship, which was at sea for an extra five days after an engine fire, is towed towards the dock as spectators watch at the port of Mobile, Alabama . Many will have unknowingly signed . Carnival's contracts prohibiting them from class action lawsuits, while . the small print also bans them suing on the grounds of emotional . distress, lawyers explained. It . comes as the company offered each customer a compensation package and . issued an apology on Thursday - which many disgruntled passengers deemed . too flimsy and too late. There has also been no sign of Carnival Corp Chairman and CEO Micky . Arison, who was criticised in January last year for failing to travel to . Italy and take personal charge of the Costa Concordia crisis. It seems he has not learned from his mistakes, as he has failed to publicly comment on the Triumph incident and was not on the scene as the massive vessel docked in Mobile, Alabama on Thursday. Where is he? Carnival Cruise Lines Chairman Micky Arison, pictured next to President Clinton at a Miami Heat game on Tuesday, has still not made a public comment about the disaster . Arduous: The ship was pulled to shore by tugboats after an engine fire knocked out the power on Sunday . Carnival has offered all guests: . No doubt adding insult to injury, he was last seen on Tuesday at the  American Airlines Arena as he watched a game between the Portland Trail Blazers and the Miami Heat, which he owns. His glaring absence could make customers more likely to lash out against the company in the courts. But for all their grievances, they may struggle to sue the operator, which has headquarters in both Florida and England, for any damages, analysts have speculated. Tickets issued by Carnival and other . cruise companies contain language limiting how much a passenger can recover in a suit. Jim Walker, with Miami-based Cruise Law News, told CTV News: 'Over decades the lawyers for cruise lines have drafted these contracts to really strip away all the rights of cruise passengers.' Walker said he has been contacted by Triumph passengers about potential suits, but he said he expects few will make it to court. 'There are certainly people who want lawsuits to be filed,' he said. 'But if you have received full compensation for the cruise, cruise credit, a little cash compensation on top of that - we certainly wouldn't be trying to do any better than that because the rights of the passengers are restricted.' Great escape: Passengers cheer after disembarking from the Carnival Triumph cruise ship on Thursday . Relief: Veronica Arriaga holds a sign referencing how passengers had to relieve themselves in red bags . On dry land: Kendall Jenkins kisses the ground after stepping off the Carnival ship Triumph in Mobile . He added that being upset by a journey is not grounds to sue - but becoming ill or injured is. While there have been no physical . injuries, if a person contracted a disease from . unsanitary conditions on the ship, they could argue for physical injury, maritime trial attorney John H. Hickey told CNN. And due to the conditions on board, many could have been at risk of these diseases. 'I think that a case can be made that . everyone on that ship is at risk of actual physical injury,' he said, . adding that the cruise line will no doubt want to diffuse the situation . as quickly as possible. 'Do . these people want to take what Carnival is offering and get on with . their lives, or do they want to get into a long legal . struggle that may not yield the results they want?' he said. Jason R. Margulies, an experienced maritime lawyer based in Miami, added that Carnival has printed a prohibition on class action . suits in its tickets, which would have only been typed in the small . print. Damage control: Carnival Cruise Lines President and CEO, Gerry Cahill issues an apology on Thursday night . A U.S. statute prohibits operators from putting such language on tickets, but . Carnival is incorporated outside the . United States, partly in Panama and Great Britain, he said. Carnival said . passengers will be reimbursed in full plus transportation expenses, a . future cruise credit equal to the amount they paid, plus a . payment of $500 a person to help compensate them. But Robin Chandler, a 50-year-old from Dallas who spent her birthday on the ship, scoffed at the compensation offer. 'There are lost wages, . I've got a baby sitter at home and I had to take off work,' she said. 'The stench was awful. A lot of people were crying and freaking out.' Some litigation could rest . on the outcome of an investigation into the fire, which started in the . engine room last Sunday and knocked out the ship's power. 'Shanty town': Passengers were forced to create makeshift shelters outside to escape the stench inside . Extreme situation: They moved beds to higher levels to escape sewage sloshing about in lower rooms . 'Restroom': A bag of human waste lies in a box on the outdoor deck of a room on the cruise ship . There are questions over why the . incident took out power on the 14-year-old ship, which had mechanical . troubles last month that delayed a similar cruise to Mexico. Company officials said the two episodes were not related, but their proximity could help customers in their pursuit of compensation, experts said. Many may fight for it following the disgusting conditions they were forced to endure, but Carnival's Chief Executive Gerry Cahill attempted damage control by stepping on the vessel last night. 'I know the conditions on board were very . poor,' he told reporters. 'I know it was difficult. I want to . apologize for subjecting our guests to that. 'We pride ourselves with providing our guests with a great vacation . experience and clearly we failed in this particular case.'","Legal analysts have cast doubt over whether lawsuits will be successful .

As if prom night in America wasn't expensive enough, chin implants are fast being added to teens’ party shopping list, along with pricey dresses. There has been a 71 per cent increase in the procedure being carried out in the U.S in the past year, with many of them being performed on high school girls desperate to look more glamorous than their peers. It doesn’t come cheap, though. An implant costs between $3,500 (£2,150) and $7,500, with some girls also splashing out over $10,000 on a dress. Growing trend: This patient underwent a chin implant, rhinoplasty, and neck liposuction to change the shape of her face - pictures courtesy of Dr. Sherman, a plastic surgeon based in San Diego . Dressed to impress: High school kids are increasingly turning to surgery to look their best for prom night . The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) believes that the trend is being fuelled by technology such as Skype and smartphones. A spokesman for the society told The . Sunday Times: ‘At proms in the past, teens would line up for photographs . and face the camera. But the rise of more informal images, captured . during video chats or by smartphones when they are leaning over a buffet . maybe, has shown them angles of their face they had not seen in a . mirror.’ Overall more than 20,000 procedures were carried out in the U.S. in 2011. The two most popular options include a mentoplasty, which decreases the size of a chin which 'juts out' or is perceived as being too large and maxillofacial corrective surgery which actually alters the jaw position. Before surgery - which can take up to four hours in some cases - patients are usually given a local anaesthetic.to numb the area and a silicone implant is inserted under the chin to give a stronger, more defined jawline. 'I do a lot of video chats and noticed that my double chin was very pronounced. It really, really bothered me,' said software manager Lizette Stephens . In many cases the patient can return home the same day, with soreness and swelling lasting for around two weeks. Commenting on the latest findings ASPS president Dr Malcolm Roth said: 'The chin and jawline are among the first areas to show signs of aging. 'People are considering chin augmentation as a way to restore their youthful look just like a facelift or eyelid surgery. 'We also know that as more people see . themselves on video chat technology, they may notice that their jawline . is not as sharp as they want it to be.' Lizette Stephens, a . manager at a software company, opted for a chin plant as new . telecommunication technologies made her increasingly conscious of her . double chin. She said: 'I do a lot of video chats . and I'm in a lot of photos and noticed that my double chin was very . pronounced. It really, really bothered me. 'I wanted to do something about it to get a more profound profile and more definition in my chin area.' Overall: 20,680 (+ 71 per cent) Women: 10,087 (+ 66 per cent) Men: 10,593 (+ 76 per cent) 20-29 years: 2,750 (+ 68 per cent) 30-39 years: 2,587 (+ 69 per cent) 40-54 years: 5,075 (+ 77 per cent) 55 and over: 8,459 (+ 70 per cent) SOURCE: American Society of Plastic . Surgeons (ASPS) She received a chin implant from Dr Darrick Antell, an ASPS Member Surgeon based in New York. Dr Antell, who has studied the . profiles of many chief executives, said: 'We know that chief executives . tend to be tall, attractive, good-looking people. 'We now know that these people . also tend to have a stronger chin. 'As a result, people subconsciously . associate a stronger chin with more authority, self-confidence and . trustworthiness.' Other cosmetic procedures that saw . an increase in popularity in the U.S. last year included lip augmentation . (up 49 per cent), cheek implants (up 47 per cent), laser skin . resurfacing (up nine per cent), soft tissue fillers (up seven per cent) and facelifts (up five per cent). According to the Enterprise Business Video Forecast: 2011-16 video conferencing is becoming one of the fastest growing IT markets in the world and by 2016 the industry will be worth £2.3bn. Orders for telepresence have already been signed by a number of global organisations, including HSBC, GlaxoSmithKline and News Corporation, whose executives are using the technology as a replacement for travelling to face-to-face meetings. Richard Thurston, Ovum analyst and author of the report, commented: 'Enterprises are seizing the huge opportunity that video conferencing offers them to cut costs and improve productivity by reducing business travel. 'They are starting to use video conferencing much more frequently because of ongoing economic concerns, continued efforts to reduce their carbon footprint, enhancements in video technology and price reductions that are improving the business case.' Despite chin implants taking off in the U.S., in the UK the procedure is still relatively rare. A spokesperson from UK cosmetic surgery provider, Transform, said: ‘Chin implants are still relatively rare in the UK, although they’ve been available to clients for more than 10 years. 'Over the past 18 months to two years we’ve seen a steady increase in the number of those opting for the procedure, but we’re around three years behind the U.S. so we expect a similar pattern to gradually emerge.'","20,680 chin augmentations carried out in the U.S. in 2011 .

An average of 1,983 children are born each day in the UK, so 2,013 of the commemorative coins have been struck to be sure there will be enough to go round. Each coin is worth £28 but parents can obtain one free by registering their child’s birth on the Royal Mint’s Facebook site. The pennies are for babies born on the same day as the child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . Evidence will be required later in the form of a birth certificate. The pennies, marked 2013, feature a shield of the Royal Arms and will be sent out in a blue or pink purse. They will be accompanied by a card  decorated with a teddy bear and the message ‘Solid sterling silver good luck penny.’ The Duke and Duchess’s baby, who will be third in line to the throne, is due to be born around the middle of this month. The Duchess, pictured with . her husband Prince William earlier this month, is due to give birth next Saturday . The silver pennies are being issued by the Royal Mint - makers of the nation's currency . Throughout history crossing the palm . of a newborn baby with silver or offering them a silver penny was seen . as a way to wish them wealth and good health throughout their life. Shane Bissett, director of . commemorative coins at the Royal Mint, said: ‘The birth of the royal . baby will be a joyous occasion not just for Their Royal Highnesses The .

The Royal Mint has an unbroken history of minting British coinage dating back more than 1,000 years. It makes a small profit each year, which will be used to pay for the baby coins. It is likely the pennies will be hugely sought after, unlike many other royal baby souvenirs.

Before a jump, she lies calmly on the aircraft floor in her body harness before it's time to make the leap. Jany, a Belgian Malinois, is strapped to the chest of an officer for parachute jumps as part of a Colombian anti-terror squad mission . Officer Jorge Herrera and Jany sit inside a Colombian air force plane before their jump . After take-off, Jany, wearing a body harness, lies at the feet of her fellow paratroopers as they wait to jump . Jany, an explosives detector dog, is part of the Group of Air Special Commands, based outside the Colombian capital Bogota. In these photographs she is seen in the arms of Officer Jorge Herrera, her tandem partner, before they get ready for their mission. The 90-strong squad fights terrorism and criminal activity at all of Colombia's airports. Each paratrooper carries their equipment on their body for their jumps, which are fraught with danger as landing areas are often full of anti-personnel blast mines - landmines designed for humans. Before they throw themselves out of their plane, the troopers bid each other farewell and wish their comrades a safe landing. Photographer Oliver Ehmig, from Colombia, captured the moments of calm. The Belgian Malinois wears a muzzle for the jump and is helped into her battle position by her human comrades . The squad members all wish each other good luck before they jump from a ramp inside their plane . The Group of Air Special Commands' task, aided by Jany, is to combat terrorist and criminal activity at all of Colombia's airports . He said: 'Minutes before the jump, I noticed the fraternal friendship between the members of the Group of Air Special Commands. 'They were joking and pulling pranks on each other and Jany seemed calm, fully aware that she’s going to jump out. 'She was extremely calm during the flight and was euphoric when she touched the ground. 'What I enjoy most is the silence before, followed by a collective euphoria among the group after the successful manoeuvre.' Mr Ehmig said recruits go through a gruelling selection process to be chosen for the team, based at the Madrid air base outside the capital. The 90-strong squad, pictured with their canine counterpart, are located at the Madrid Air Base, outside the Colombian capital, Bogota . Jumps can be dangerous for the soldiers because landing area are often dotted with anti-personnel blast mines .

He added: 'Their members have been through the legendary “Lancer” course, considered one of the most rigorous military training in the world. 'They are highly trained to resolve airplane hostage situations.' The Belgian Malinois, related to the German Shepherd, is popular with armed forces and the police for its loyalty and ability to detect explosives and drugs.

Chris Grayling today unveiled plans to replace young offender institutions with 'secure colleges' Young offender institutions will be closed down and replaced with ‘secure colleges’, under radical plans unveiled by Chris Grayling today. The Justice Secretary will invite private schools to bid to run the new centres, which have been inspired by the Government’s free schools policy. It raises the prospect of schools such as Eton helping to put tearaways back on the straight and narrow. Mr Grayling wants teenage criminals to spend their time in custody learning how to read and write and passing exams – not sitting in a cell brooding. Up to £200,000 a year is spent housing a young burglar or mugger in a young offender institution (YOI) – more than five times the cost of a place at Eton. Mr Grayling argues this is a waste of money when a staggering three-quarters of inmates reoffend upon release. He will say today: ‘We cannot go on just doing more of the same, pouring more money into a system which doesn’t work in the hope of a different outcome. ‘That doesn’t make any sense to the taxpayer, or to the young people who we should be trying to get back on the straight and narrow. ‘I want to see new models, perhaps something like secure colleges, providing education in a period of detention, rather than detention with education as an after-thought. ‘I want young people to get the education and skills they need to turn their backs on crime for good.’ The idea of axing YOIs – which have housed notorious inmates such as Jon Venables and Robert Thompson over the years – is likely to prove controversial. Several YOIs, which are often run by private firms, are coming to the end of their contracts with the Ministry of Justice. This allows them to be closed down and replaced with the ‘secure colleges’. Private firms, charities and schools will be invited to consider running them, under a Green Paper published today. Up to £200,000 a year is spent per year on a young offender - more than five times the cost of a place at Eton . It follows the successful policy of allowing parents, charities and other organisations to open free schools. Eton recently joined the group behind a new state-funded Holyport College free school, near Maidenhead. The school’s 500 pupils will include 225 boarders, costing parents £9,000-12,000 a year, while daytime education will be free. Max Chambers, head of crime and justice at Policy Exchange, said: ‘Academies are currently transforming some of the toughest schools in the country. Schools such as Eton College, pictured, will be invited to consider running new secure colleges under a Green Paper published today . 'So it seems like a good idea to apply the principles of those reforms – greater flexibility, a focus on improving pupil discipline and encouraging new providers into the state system – to the education of young offenders.’ But Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ‘We should never send children to prison to get an education. 'Almost all the children who end up in custody could be dealt with in the community and that is the way to get them back into school, college or training.’","Justice Secretary Chris Grayling wants teenage criminals to pass exams .

Britain’s motorists are becoming a nation of ‘dashboard dunces’ baffled by the increasing array of warning lights in their cars, new research has revealed. More than nine in ten people failed to recognise one particular warning. The study identified 99 separate dashboard light warnings in 15 of the UK’s most popular cars ranging from the humble Nissan hatchback to Mercedes-Benz executive saloons. Yet just 12 of the symbol designs were common across all models. Breakdown firm Britannia Rescue, which commissioned the report, also conducted a survey of 2,018 drivers that revealed more than half of drivers (52 per cent) can correctly identify all 16 of the most common symbols. The company said the number of warnings on dashboards varied dramatically from one make to another and highlighted the Mercedes-Benz E Class for having 41 compared to 21 in a Nissan Micra, BMW 3 Series and Volvo S40. The Britannia Rescue poll found that a quarter of motorists have had one or more warning symbols light up while driving in the past 12 months – most commonly the engine, oil or battery lights. The Mercedes-Benz E Class (pictured) had the most symbols with 41 compared to 21 in the Nissan Micra . The most baffling light is for a faulty catalytic converter which was incorrectly identified by 95 per cent of drivers. Next for confusion was the air conditioning light which 86 per cent got wrong, followed by a tyre pressure warning that flummoxed 71 per cent. Nearly half (48 per cent) do not even recognise the brake warning light and more than a third (35 per cent) cannot understand an airbag alert, with almost as many (27 per cent) mistaking it for a seat-belt warning. Dashboard lights commonly inform drivers about problems like poor battery condition, low oil pressure and high engine temperature. But many cars now have lights for service interval indicators and seatbelt reminders along with malfunctions ranging from faulty anti-skid stability control to blocked air and fuel filters, defective diesel filters or fuel contaminated by water. A Britannia Rescue spokesman said:’Cars have become so complex that the majority of drivers don’t understand what all of the most common warning or information lights on a car dashboard mean. ‘As in-car technology becomes more . advanced there are now more and more in-car gadgets with symbols that . support everything from the car’s sat-nav system to its heating and . cooling options. 'The problem is being exacerbated by the fact that many warning light symbols are specific to a manufacturer or even the individual model.’ The majority carry on driving and it takes an average 12 days before they get the problem checked but six per cent admitted they ignored a warning light for more than a month which can be costly. Drivers who take 14 days to repair their car pay £200, more than double the £85 spent by drivers who get cars fixed immediately. Mercedes–Benz UK said its high dashboard symbol count was due to the complex safety systems it fits including ‘collision prevention assist’ which boosts the braking force when sensors that monitor the distance of vehicles ahead detect a potential impact. Spokesman Angus Fitton said its cars also have more warning lights due to its two-stage system on common items like fuel level which are amber initially and then red if no action is taken: ‘Providing more information is preferable to providing too little. 'The two-level system does mean there are more symbols on the dashboard. Some are just to give you a nudge to remind you. Others are more critical.'","Nine in 10 failed to recognise the sign for a faulty catalytic converter .

Scotland Yard was today asked to investigate fresh claims of law-breaking over union influence in the Labour party. The scandal deepened today as the Tories called on the Met Police to investigate allegations of orchestrated behaviour by Unite in Ilford North and Lewisham Deptford. Ed Miliband has insisted the problems which have plunged his leadership into crisis were confined to Falkirk, but there is a growing sense that union domination of the party is more widespread. Pressure: Ed Miliband is facing the biggest test of his leadership since beating his brother David for the top Labour job in September 2010 . The Labour leader is preparing to give a major speech tomorrow on overhauling the party’s links with its union paymasters, but is expected to stop short of severing ties completely. He has been warned he must win an ‘ideological battle’ with his union paymasters to avoid political oblivion. Unite was accused of trying to fix the selection process for Falkirk’s parliamentary candidate to benefit Karie Murphy, a close friend of Unite general secretary Len McCluskey. Police have launched a fraud inquiry over claims that people were signed up as Labour party members by Unite – without their knowledge – so they could vote for Miss Murphy. But Labour bosses have also received complaints about Unite’s activities in several other constituencies. Today Bob Neill, a Tory party vice-chairman, called on Scotland Yard to investigate claims of ‘fraudulent behaviour’ in two London constituencies. But the Labour party dismissed the move as a 'silly political stunt'. Police: Tory vice-chairman Bob Neill has written to Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, asking Scotland Yard to investigate union behaviour in two London seats . In a letter to Met Commissioner . Bernard Hogan-Howe, Mr Neill said: ‘I am sure that you will be aware of . the current police investigation taking place in Scotland, into the . alleged fraud committed by the Unite trade union in Falkirk. 'It is alleged that Unite in Falkirk were signing up their own members to the Labour Party without their consent and knowledge. ‘I . am concerned that this instance is just the tip of the iceberg, as . Unite themselves admit they are targeting another 40 Labour Party . parliamentary selections for similar treatment. Senior Labour Party . sources have also confessed that the problems go wider than just . Falkirk. ‘In particular there are two London constituencies of particular concern: Ilford North and Lewisham Deptford.’ What is going on?There . is a battle for control of the Labour party between leader Ed Miliband . and the unions, most significantly Unite and its general secretary Len . McCluskey. What has happened?The . row was triggered by allegations that Unite paid for dozens of people . to join the local party in Falkirk - possibly without their knowledge - . in order to swing the vote and ensure its preferred candidate Karie . Murphy won. It has now been suggested that union influence in constituencies goes beyond Falkirk, including two seats in London: Ilford North and Lewisham Deptford.’Why does this matter?The . idea of Labour being in hoc to the unions remains toxic for many . voters. Unite has given more than £8million to the Labour party . since Mr Miliband became leader and has boasted of its intention to . secure a more left wing agenda. He only beat his brother for the Labour . leadership in 2010 because he won the support of unions. He claims that in Ilford North, Unite offered their members free Labour Party membership in exchange for attending a meeting with General Secretary Len McCluskey. ‘Given that this constituency appears on a Unite target list along with Falkirk, I believe that the circumstances of this membership recruitment merit investigation’, Mr Neill added. The letter also points to claims from a London Labour activist Mandy Richards that Unite is ‘bankrolling’ a number of ‘orchestrated’ campaigns. She singles out Lewisham Deptford for 'special attention'. Mr Neill says the activities, if true, could be in breach of the Fraud Act 2006 under the terms of ‘false misrepresentation’ or fraud by abuse of position. He adds: ‘I would be very grateful for any assistance that you can offer in investigating this deeply troubling matter.’ Labour insiders had been keen to stress that problems with Unite's practices in Labour constituency parties was contained to Falkirk alone. A Labour source said: 'This is a silly political stunt. 'We have no evidence of possible criminal behaviour anywhere outside Falkirk. If Bob Neill has, he should produce it. If he has not, he should stop wasting police time.' But the suggestion that it could be more widespread, and the involvement of Britain's biggest police force, means the scandal could spread far beyond Mr Miliband's control. Tomorrow, the Labour leader will outline plans to change his party’s rules and limit the power of the unions. Insiders say Mr Miliband is examining . whether to hold open primary elections – which would let the general . public elect parliamentary candidates – as well as plans to speed up the . selection process, leaving unions less time to mobilise. He also plans . to make it more difficult for unions to sign up new party members. Leaked Unite documents show it sought to exploit rules that let unions . pay new members’ fees to secure 41 candidacies.  Labour has since . scrapped the scheme. Party insiders said concerns have . already been raised about the union’s activities in Chester and . Brighton, Glasgow, Crawley, East Dunbartonshire, Paisley, Garston and . Halewood and Ilford North. Scandal: The Unite union led by Len McCluskey, left, tried to impose Karie Murphy, right, on the Falkirk seat . Unite has also been accused of plotting to . oust shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander. Lord Reid, the former home secretary, said Unite leader Len McCluskey wanted . to take Labour ‘back to the 80s’ – and that Mr Miliband must move . swiftly to make sure the party survives. He said Mr Miliband faces ‘an ideological . battle’ with ‘those who want to take Labour back to the 70s and 80s, as . Len McCluskey does – when we represented the sectional voice, the weak . echo of every industrial demand of the trade unions’. ‘I . am in no doubt that the leader of Unite wants to impose an ideological . direction on the Labour Party that would lead us into political . oblivion,’ he added.","Met Police urged by Tories to investigate Unite influence in Ilford North and Lewisham Deptford .

A woman bit off more than she could chew at a burger restaurant and was left nursing a dislocated jaw. Nicola Peate’s jaw locked while she was eating the triple-patty 'Kids in America Burger' at Almost Famous in Liverpool. Colleagues laughed it off when the incident first happened during a work night out on and after fiance Neil finished the remainder of the burger, the pair made their way home - oblivious to the seriousness of the injury. Nicola Peate tried to eat it with a knife and fork and couldn't - but her big bite caused her jaw to dislocate . But by the time Nicola, 25, arrived at work the next day, the pain had become unbearable. She said: 'I didn’t think I’d dislocated it - you don’t expect it to happen eating a burger. 'But I tried to eat it with a knife and fork and couldn’t. I couldn’t open my mouth fully. 'It felt like I had cramp in my tongue, then I started to get an ear ache and a headache. 'The next morning I woke up and felt really, really ill. The whole side of my head was hurting. 'Then it started to feel like it was in my jaw and I knew I’d dislocated it.' A doctor at the Royal Liverpool University had to manipulate Nicola's jaw back into place . Doctors recommend cutting big bites into more manageable chunks . An x ray in the Emergency Department at . the Royal Liverpool Hospital confirmed Nicola’s fears and a doctor . quickly manipulated her jaw back into place using his thumbs. 'The minute it went back in it was like turning a tap off in my head,' Nicola remembered. 'All the tension just went.' Nicola has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), which means she has hyper-flexible joints that are unstable and therefore prone to dislocation, so she has visited many hospitals over the years. The clinical director of the Royal’s Emergency Department Kathryn Clark said: 'Thankfully, incidents such as this are rare but our staff are very experienced in diagnosing and correcting dislocations. 'I hope that in future, she takes more care when eating over-sized burgers. 'If food is too large, we would recommend cutting it into more manageable chunks, particularly if you have Elhers-danlos syndrome.' A spokeswoman for Almost Famous invited Nicola to enjoy a burger on them - complete with an emergency kit including cutlery and painkillers should she need it. She said: While it’s something that people joke about quite often, this is definitely the first instance of jaw dislocation as a result of an Almost Famous burger we've ever heard of.'","Nicola Peate's jaw locked while she was eating the triple-patty in Liverpool .

A new book about Nazis on the run after WW2 shows how governments around the world torpedoed efforts to hunt down the worst of the Holocaust murderers for decades out of 'vested interests'. 'Nazi Hunt: South America's Dictatorships and the Avenging of Nazi Crimes,' by German historian Daniel Stahl, calls the half-hearted efforts of postwar governments a 'coalition of the unwilling.' He says the French feared prosecutions would expose mass collaboration with the Nazis, the South Americans feared a spotlight on their own murderous regimes and the West Germans wanted to help 'old comrades' get away. One that got away: The 'perverted Angel of Auschwitz' Dr Josef Mengele, (left) was able to flee to South America while former comrades Rudolf Hoess (centre) Josef Kramer (right) were hanged for war crimes . These were not the 'little fish' of the Nazi extermination programme but people like 'Angel of Death' Josef Mengele, who chose victims for the gas chambers, and Gustav Wagner, responsible for 150,000 deaths at the Nazi extermination camp of Sobibor. While a physician at Auschwitz, Mengele consigned arrivals to the gas chambers and carried out appalling experiments on Jews, most of whom died in agony without anaesthetic. Mengele, who murdered hundreds of children in warped medical experiments, died in Brazil in 1979 . Another one that governments conspired . together to keep free was S.S. Colonel Walther Rauff, one of the . developers of the mobile 'gas vans' used to kill Jews before the static . death camp gulag was built. Stahl found documents in German archives which showed that an official of the German foreign ministry deliberately delayed his own government's request for his extradition from Chile for 14 months in order for him to prepare to flee elsewhere. 'The West German judiciary in particular was guilty of serious lapses,' said Stahl, a history professor who trawled through long-sealed archives to prove the extent of collusion in keeping history's greatest war criminals at large. S.S. murderer Rauff was even able to travel between South America and Germany as a company rep without hinderance. It wasn't until 1961 that he was indicted for 100,000 murders but he never faced justice, dying from a heart attack in Chile instead after his adopted government refused an extradition request. Damning minutes of an Interpol executive committee meeting in 1962 shows up the French attitude to the killers. Interpol secretary general Marcel Sicot, responding to a request from Jewish organisations to more vigorously track them down, stormed: 'Why should war criminals be prosecuted since the victor always imposes his laws, anyway? Among the Nazis to escape trial were S.S. Colonel Walther Rauff (left) who helped to develop mobile 'gas vans' and Staff Sergeant Gustav Wagner (right) responsible for 150,000 deaths at the extermination camp of Sobibor . 'No international entity defines the term ""war criminal.'"" Sicot said he regarded the criminal prosecution of Nazi crimes as 'victor's justice.' 'As henchmen of the Vichy regime, the French collaborated with the Nazis until 1944,' said Stahl. 'They stood opposed to the criminal prosecution of Nazi crimes.' His book will be published in English later this year.","New book details the half-hearted efforts to capture leading Nazis .

David Cameron’s spokesman refused ten times yesterday to say whether the Prime Minister would support fracking near his home in Oxfordshire. After Mr Cameron said gas drilling should be welcomed across the country, his spokesman would not be drawn over the prospect of wells in the Prime Minister’s own backyard where there are shale rocks. The spokesman would say only that ‘ultimately the Prime Minister supports fracking’ and there should be a ‘dialogue with local people’ about any attempts to extract the fuel. David Cameron: 'Ultimately' the Prime Minister supports fracking and there should be a 'dialogue with local people', according to his spokesman . Asked several times whether, as a local resident, Mr Cameron – MP for Witney in Oxfordshire – would support such an application, the spokesman added: ‘While I’m unwilling to get into a hypothetical of where a well may or may not be opened, the point is anywhere in the country where there is that possibility of shale gas exploration taking place it is important for  dialogue to take place with local people, and that is as relevant in his constituency as it would be in any area of this country.’ In a newspaper article published yesterday, the Prime Minister urged communities to ‘seize’ the chance to have shale gas exploration near their homes, saying drill sites are only the size of a cricket pitch and there is little evidence the process causes environmental damage or contaminates water  supplies as campaigners have claimed. Fracking could create 70,000 jobs and lower energy bills for millions, while communities which accept it will be given sweeteners of £100,000 for their area, he said. Mr Cameron points to the US where a decade of fracking has seen gas prices plummet and the country is now virtually self-sufficient in energy. But independent experts say it is still unclear whether it will lower bills at all in Britain. Anti-fracking protest at the Cuadrilla fracking site in Balcombe, Sussex, yesterday . Earlier this year, the British Geological Survey released its report on shale reserves in northern England, predicting there could be 1,300trillion cubic feet of gas underground – in theory enough to meet Britain’s needs for more than a century. But Richard Sarsfield-Hall, an energy markets experts at Pöyry Management Consulting, said the gas which could be extracted would at most produce 25 per cent of what is needed in the UK and would ‘not lead to a collapse in prices’. In contrast, the US had a ‘glut’ of gas which saw prices plummet. Fracking – short for hydraulic fracturing – involves drilling a well up to 3,000ft deep and pumping water and chemicals into it at high pressure to crack the rocks and release fuel trapped inside. It has so far taken place in Lancashire after a delay of some months  following two small earthquakes. Dozens more wells could be drilled there in the next two years. In the South, across Dorset, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex and Kent, there is also thought to be plentiful shale oil or gas, but fierce protests have accompanied the drilling of an exploratory well in the village of Balcombe, West Sussex. Last night Ian Hudspeth, leader of Oxfordshire County Council, said: ‘Any applications would be considered on a case-by-case basis, but we haven’t had any so far. ‘Personally I feel we have got an energy crisis in this country and we’ve got to look at all forms of alternative energy, if the relevant safeguards are in place and it is not in an area of outstanding natural beauty.’ ÷ Downing Street said Mr Cameron would support England when they play Scotland in a football friendly at Wembley tomorrow. His spokesman initially deflected the question, but it was later conceded that he would back Roy Hodgson’s team.","Mr Cameron said gas drilling should be welcomed across the country .

A drug first developed for cancer has shown great promise in treating children with Progeria, a rare and fatal rapid-aging disease. The genetic condition, which affects one in eight million people, causes the body to age eight times faster than normal. The disorder is said to have inspired . the F Scott Fitzgerald novella and Brad Pitt movie The Curious Case of . Benjamin Button, in which the character is born an old man and ages . backwards. Scroll down for video . Hayley Okines, 14, from Bexhill, has defied the odds to live with progeria for so long and has published her own autobiography. She participated in the Ionafarnib drug trial . Now promising results have emerged from the first-ever clinical drug trial for the condition, including improvements in weight gain, bone structure and heart health. A third of children placed on the drug Ionafarnib demonstrated a . greater than 50 per cent increase in annual rate of weight gain or switched from . weight loss to weight gain, due to increased muscle and bone mass. On average skeletal rigidity, which was . highly abnormal in patients at the time of the trial, improved to normal levels after . treatment. Meanwhile arterial stiffness, which is linked with an increased risk of having a heart-attack, decreased by 35 per cent. Scientists first discovered the cause of . progeria just six years ago, pinpointing a single mutation in the gene . called LMNA, which produces a protein that holds the nucleus of a cell . together. The disorder is said to have inspired the F Scott Fitzgerald novella and Brad Pitt movie The Curious Case of Benjamin Button . Children with the condition produce too much of the protein progerin as a result, which blocks normal cell function and has a toxic effect on the body. As a result children with the disease die from heart disease that is more usual in elderly adults. The average age of death is just 13 years old. Study author Dr Leslie Gordon, from Boston Children's Hospital, said: . 'To discover that some aspects of damage . to the blood vessels in Progeria cannot only be slowed by the drug . called lonafarnib, but even partially reversed within just 2.5 years of . treatment is a tremendous breakthrough, because cardiovascular disease . is the ultimate cause of death in children with Progeria.' The two-and-a-half year drug trial involved 26 children with the disease - which was three-quarters of the known Progeria cases when it started. They took lonafarnib orally twice-a-day over the course of the study and visited Boston Children's Hospital every four months for comprehensive medical testing. Measures taken included rate of weight gain as children with progeria struggle to thrive. Bone density and rigidity were also analysed as indicators of osteoporosis while arterial stiffness was studied as a predictor of stroke and heart attack. The study results have been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.","Children placed on the drug saw improvements in weight gain, bone structure and heart health .

The decision raised fears that – irrespective of the rights . and wrongs of fracking – the rule of law was being flouted. Now . environmental activists say that, despite security patrols around the . drilling site and a barbed wire fence, they are  confident they can end . the drilling altogether. Veteran . campaigners from Manchester, Gloucestershire and Brighton joined a . 1,200-strong camp set up in a nearby field yesterday, marching from . Balcombe railway station to the drilling site. Police advised Cuadrilla to close the site after hundreds of people joined protests. Pictured, today's demonstration .

Describing . himself as a ‘professional protester’ he said it was the 14th . demonstration he had funded through claiming benefits. He added: ‘We’re . winning as they’ve already halted the drilling and we can stick it out . here until it’s removed altogether. ‘The police can’t handle us and . don’t want to deal with it. This is a waste of the police’s money and . their time. 'They can’t win as we outnumber them and it’s too large a . space to contain. ‘They’re scared and I think they have got officers in from other parts of the country as the Sussex ones got on with us.’ Protests (pictured today) have attracted support from Green politicians and celebrities such as Vivienne Westwood .

"By . Tamara Cohen and Matt Chorley . PUBLISHED: . 20:34 EST, 22 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:32 EST, 23 November 2012 . A senior Tory MP who earns thousands of pounds advising green energy firms today insisted it was 'reasonable' for electricity bills to rise by £100-a-year to help pay for more wind farms. Tim Yeo, chairman of the Commons energy and climate change committee, leapt to the government's defence after it emerged deal between Tories and Lib Dems on Britain's power plans would see bills rise. Electricity bills could rise by £75 a year by 2020 to fund a new generation of wind farms and nuclear reactors. And by 2030 annual bills will go up by an estimated £178 under all the Government’s green and fuel poverty policies. Electric bills could rise by £75 a year to fund the green energy strategy to be unveiled next week . A green energy strategy to be unveiled next week will treble the costs levied on bills from £2.35billion a year to £7.6billion. But Mr Yeo insisted it was not a problem.  'I personally think that a couple of pounds a week - maybe rising to almost £3 a week - is a reasonable price for Britain to achieve a degree of energy security to reduce its total dependence on fossil fuels and to honour its commitments to cut green house gases,' he told BBC Radio 4. However Mr Yeo, who earns almost £140,000 from green energy companies, faced criticism from Conservative colleagues. Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘The average constituent in Clacton is already paying between £10 and £20 extra for their electricity as a direct consequence of these hidden green surcharges. ‘If you have lots of non-executive payments from green energy companies, then perhaps another £2 or £3 a week doesn’t sound a large sum of money from your household budget. ‘For those in my constituency who do not have green energy directorships, then it is a lot of money.’ Earlier Energy Secretary Ed Davey dismissed claims of huge hikes in bills as 'utter rubbish' and claimed without the measures bills would rise even higher. 'The impact from supporting clean technologies is only 2% on peoples’ bills at the moment. By the end of the decade that will grow, and by 2020 will be about 7%,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'We’re talking about under £100 in 2020. In 2012 today we’re talking just £20. The figures that are being bandied around are utter rubbish. 'If you take account of all our policies, which I think when you’re talking about energy you should look at all aspects of energy policy, and we are making measures on energy efficiency, which will help people save money.' Victory: George Osborne won a battle of wills with Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey (right) who backed a target of cutting power station emissions to a seventh of their current level by 2030 . In another development, plans for a drastic cap on carbon emissions have been slapped down by George Osborne. The . Chancellor won a battle of wills with Mr Davey, a Liberal Democrat, who . backed a legally-binding target contained in the Coalition agreement. The . Government’s climate advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, wanted . to cut power station emissions to a seventh of their current level by . 2030 in order to meet Britain’s climate change commitments. It . would have meant gas, which provides more than half of Britain’s power, . being phased out unless its emissions can be captured and stored using . technology that does not even exist. Mr . Osborne has rejected the call for the cap, which the Treasury feared . would have driven up fuel prices and hit economic growth. A . Whitehall source said of next week’s Energy Bill: ‘They have agreed . there will be no target in this parliament, a decision on whether there . will be one at all will not be taken until 2016.’ But it is understood the Treasury . stood firm on green levies on electricity bills rising to no higher than . £95 a year by 2020 – compared with £20 currently. The expected £178 increase by 2030 . would cover all the Government’s green and fuel poverty policies . including investment in the power network. How to keep the lights on while . keeping household electricity bills at a reasonable level has bitterly . divided the Coalition because a fifth of Britain’s power plants are set . to close in the next decade. Mr Davey told MPs this week that the negotiations on energy policy had been ‘challenging’. Yesterday his spokesman said they had . lost the battle for a ‘decarbonisation’ target. ‘We made no secret of . our commitment to the target’, she said. ‘But we are pleased to have . reached an agreement, which will send an important signal to investors . and create 250,000 jobs.’ Mr Davey's department is committed to thousands more wind turbines despite opposition . The renewable energy industry is facing a crisis, Labour leader Ed Miliband warned yesterday. He said firms were becoming confused by ‘mixed messages’ from David Cameron’s Government. The Coalition should instead, he insisted, pledge that all of Britain’s electricity should come from non-carbon sources. He said this would create thousands of jobs, adding: ‘This is absolutely in our economic interest. ‘We’ve got to be absolutely clear about this crisis our green industry is facing. And the crisis is caused by the huge uncertainty this Government is creating about its intention on climate change and energy.’ He claimed the Prime Minister’s commitment to the environment had ‘evaporated’ since he came to power in 2010. Green groups were furious about the . failure to sign up to a decarbonisation target for 2030, saying David Cameron had betrayed promises to lead the ‘greenest . government ever’. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, said: 'By failing to agree to any carbon target for the power sector until after the next election, David Cameron has allowed a militant tendency within his own ranks to derail the Energy Bill.' Friends of the Earth's executive director Andy Atkins added: 'The coalition has caved in to Osborne's reckless dash for gas and banged the final nail in the coffin of Cameron's pledge to lead the greenest Government ever.' Mr Osborne is sceptical about the costs of renewable . energy, telling the Conservative party conference last year: ‘We are not . going to save the planet by putting our country out of business.’ Last week his father-in-law Lord . Howell was secretly filmed by Greenpeace campaigners saying the . Chancellor was putting pressure on the Prime Minister to abandon his . environmental commitments. Mr Osborne favours a ‘dash for gas’ as . the cheapest way to power the economy, and will announce a gas . generation strategy in the coming weeks which is set to stoke further . tensions with the Energy Secretary and environmental groups. The target . recommended by the Government’s climate advisers was to force power . stations to produce only 50g of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour by . 2030. Gas power currently emits around 350g. Mr Davey said recently that he was . ‘absolutely committed’ to the target and that: ‘After 2030 we expect . that gas will increasingly be used only as back-up, or fitted with . carbon capture and storage technology.’ Britain is still committed to cutting . emissions by 80 per cent by 2050 under the 2008 Climate Change Act. But . campaigners and businesses doubt this can be achieved without . overhauling the energy market to attract more than £100billion of . investment in green power. A generation of nuclear plants will be . built and Mr Davey’s department is committed to thousands more wind . turbines, despite opposition from local communities and more than 100 . Conservative MPs.","Battle of wills between George Osborne and Ed Davey sees cap on carbon emissions dropped .

As the singer attended a listening party and dinner for her third studio album in Beverly Hills on Thursday, she opted for a structured gold dress. Golden girl: Lady Gaga leaves a building in Beverly Hills after her Artpop dinner . Creating excitement: Gaga showed some promotional artwork from her new album on her Facebook page . With such a striking dress and matching gold platform boots, Gaga opted for a more natural make-up look than usual. The New Yorker, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, completed her outfit with a long gold wig.

U.S. airlines have resumed all flights to Mexico City after voluntarily cancelling several dozen because of an eruption from the nearby Popocatepetl volcano, according to an airport official. Mexico City International Airport information chief Richard Jimenez says United and American Airlines resumed flights Thursday night. On Friday, there were no reports of cancellations by any airline. At least six U.S. airlines canceled 47 flights into and out of the Mexico City and Toluca airports on Thursday as the volcano spewed a mile-high (1.5 kilometer-high) plume of ash that drifted over large parts of Mexico City, 40 miles (65 kilometers) away.

Gomez said that among the routes affected by the cancellations were flights to Houston, Dallas, Denver, Phoenix, Chicago and Los Angeles. At nearby Toluca airport, Spirit Airlines canceled flights from Dallas and Fort Lauderdale, said spokesman Alejandro Munoz. The airport, about 35 miles (60 kilometers) from Mexico City, also continued to operate normally, Munoz said. Authorities registered several tremors Thursday at the 17,886-foot (5,450-meter) volcano, which has been spraying a fountain of hot rock and ash for the last 24 hours. Six carriers including U.S. Airways, Delta, United, American and Alaska Airlines have canceled 47 flights as a precaution . Federal civil protection authorities established a 7-mile (12-kilometer) safety radius around the Popocatepetl, which means no one can enter that area.

"By . Associated Press and Reuters Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:49 EST, 13 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:09 EST, 13 June 2012 . JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon defended the intent of the portfolio behind the bank's recent multibillion-dollar trading loss, telling lawmakers it was a genuine hedge that would make the firm a lot of money if a credit crisis hit. Dimon, appearing before the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday, said well-intentioned traders poorly executed the hedge, and the bank's senior management failed to police the London office behind the trades. Lawmakers have questioned whether the trades, that have yielded more than $2billion in losses so far, were truly a hedge or a speculative bet that was hidden from shareholders and regulators. Good intent: Jamie Dimon, chairman of the board, president and CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. testifies before a Senate Banking, Housing Committee hearing today . Greed: A protester, right, screams at Dimon as he testifies at the hearing; around a dozen people were escorted from the hearing . 'This particular synthetic credit portfolio was intended to earn a lot of revenue if there was a crisis. I consider that a hedge,' Dimon said. 'What it morphed into, I will not try to defend.' Dimon, under close questioning about his role in setting up the investment division of the bank responsible for the loss, declared: 'We made a mistake. I'm absolutely responsible. The buck stops with me.' Dimon's highly anticipated appearance before lawmakers got off to a rocky start with multiple protesters disrupting the event. The protests started with one man yelling out 'Jamie Dimon is a crook' as Dimon approached the witness table. Dimon, dressed in a conservative navy suit, appeared unperturbed by the barrage of insults. Another group of protesters then started chanting, 'Stop foreclosures now' before they were escorted out of the cavernous hearing room. The trading loss has heightened concerns that the biggest banks still pose risks to the U.S. financial system, less than four years after the financial crisis in the fall of 2008. Two Democrats on the committee, Sens. Charles Schumer of New York and Robert Menendez of New Jersey, expressed concern about what would have happened if the trading loss had occurred at a weaker bank. Media storm: Members of the press surround Dimon as he prepared to testify . JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States by assets and is considered among the strongest. Dimon often makes note of the bank's 'fortress balance sheet.' But Menendez hypothesized about a larger loss, perhaps $50 billion, that creates a run on the bank 'and that ultimately becomes the collective responsibility of each and every American.' Menendez also challenged Dimon on his strenuous opposition to stricter financial regulation and noted that JPMorgan received a $20 billion taxpayer bailout at the height of the crisis in the fall of 2008. Dimon said repeatedly that the bank's senior management failed by not detecting the London office's spike in risk, and said the bank will consider taking back pay from certain executives once the banks' board is done with their review. 'I would say it's likely... there will be claw backs,' Dimon said. Dimon revealed during a surprise conference call last month that a hedging strategy in its London office had gone awry, producing at least $2 billion, and possibly $3billion, in trading losses. That was after Dimon in April dismissed as a 'tempest in a teapot' news reports that a 'London whale' in that office had amassed an outsized position that prompted hedge funds to bet against it. Dimon said he made that statement after attorneys and others told him they thought any problems in the London Chief Investment Office were an isolated, small issue. On guard: An NYPD officer stood guard the entrance to the JP Morgan Chase World Headquarters in New York last month as an investigation was carried out . 'When I made that statement, I was dead wrong,' Dimon said. The so-called Volcker rule, which goes into effect in July, will prevent banks from making certain trades for their own profit. Banks won an exemption to trade to protect their broad portfolios, as Dimon has said JPMorgan was doing in this case. Dimon told the committee, however, that 'I have a hard time distinguishing it.' He allowed that 'it's possible' that the Volcker rule would have prevented the debacle at JPMorgan but said he didn't know. The CEO said that JPMorgan adopted a strategy late last year to reduce risk, but it backfired in its investment operation by heightening risk instead. The bank has named a new leader for the investment operation that was responsible for the loss.","JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon testifying today over company's multi-billion trading loss .

Scientists have discovered tectonic plates hidden deep within the Earth's mantle, which they say rewrite 40 years of history about the evolution . of western North America. It has long been thought that North . America's mountainous west was formed - at a time when dinosaurs prowled the earth - by the movement of an undersea plate called Farallon in a process similar to the . way a supermarket conveyor belt moves with groceries on top. Millions of years ago, the tectonic plate moved eastward beneath the continent, dragging islands along with it until they smashed and reformed along . the west coast, forming the mountainous ridges of the wild west, scientists had previously thought. This 3-D image renders the mountainous topography of the western U.S., and the ancient oceanic plate from the surface down to 1500 km depth (colour changes in depth increments of 200 km) But revising 200million years of geologic history in what has been described as a 'eureka moment', a research group now claims that the process involved not . just one but several plates that remain hidden deep within the . Earth's mantle. Scientists at Ludwig Maximilians . University in Munich and the British Columbia Geological Survey used seismic tomography, or earthquake shockwaves, to create a . three-dimensional map of these massive crust plates, which are now languishing some 500 . to 1,200 miles beneath the Earth's surface. The plate relics, according to lead author and geophysicist Karin Sigloch and  her colleague Mitch Mihalynuk, look like almost vertical walls, hundreds of feet thick. The authors propose that the newly named . Angayucham and Mezcalera plates may have existed beneath long-vanished . seas. The geologic history of western North America since the Jurassic period. The left shows time slices of undersea oceanic crust, and the right shows the position of geologic features based on the position of the subducted slabs .

They claim there were sandwiched, and overrun, by a westward-moving North . American plate and eastward-moving Farallon plates, the LA Times reports. Sigloch found the plates are colder and denser than the surrounding . mantle rock, and that seismic waves change speed as they pass through the . plates, revealing their location. No one had seen the plates in such detail before because it requires powerful computers and . seismic monitoring equipment, both of which were only developed in the last decade. The study was published in the journal Nature, on Wednesday, Live Science reports. 'The largest wall runs from northwest Canada to the eastern U.S.A. and on to Central America, and has been called the Farallon slab, one of the most massive features in global tomographies,' authors wrote. 'We argue that in fact most of this slab wall is not Farallon and subdivide it into the Angayucham, Mezcalera and the Southern Farallon components.' Mihalynuk told Live Science: 'It will take a while to turn people around. That intellectual ship has a lot of inertia... this is one of those eureka moments.' The authors have said a further study was needed to understand the whole of the 'jigsaw puzzle'. 'Poorly understood, such collisions are of broad scientific interest' authors wrote. 'They cause rapid geographic changes, affecting climate, ocean circulation, biota and the formation of economically important mineral deposits.' The old WestThe story begins 200 million years ago, just before the Atlantic Ocean basin first opened. North America was crammed into the Pangaea supercontinent and the vast Panthalassa Ocean covered the rest of the planet.Panthalassa's ocean floor has almost completely disappeared under North America as Earth's tectonic plates have shifted., so its history is somewhat cryptic. A few geologic clues led scientists to the prevailing model, contested by the new study. The puzzle pieces include the few remaining bits of Panthalassic ocean floor, rocks scattered along western North America, and remnants of the old oceanic crust seen under the continent, where the plate disappeared into the mantle, the layer of Earth beneath the crust.Pangaea supercontinentAfter North America started shifting to the west 185 million years ago, away from Africa and Europe, the prevailing model placed a subduction zone along the West Coast that consumed Panthalassa's huge oceanic tectonic plate, the Farallon plate. Imagine a setting like today's Andes in South America. Like a giant conveyor belt, the subduction zone delivered exotic terranes that built out the western continent.But for some scientists, the puzzle pieces just didn't fit this picture. Sigloch and Mihalynuk think they know why.Sigloch looked deep into the mantle, at the remnants of oceanic crust that remain beneath North America. In a subduction zone, two of Earth's tectonic plates collide and one slides into the mantle. The plates are colder and denser than the surrounding mantle rock. Seismic waves change their speed as they pass through the plates, revealing their location. No one had seen these old pieces of crust in this detail before because it requires powerful computers and very dense arrays of seismic monitoring equipment, both of which came about in the last decade.Sigloch discovered a vertical pile of oceanic crust segments stacked on top of one another like bricks. The massive wall runs from northwest Canada to Central America, and is 250 to 375 miles wide (400 to 600 kilometers) and extends from between 500 to 1,200 miles (800 to 2,000 km) beneath the surface. These former slabs, as geologists call subducted crust, fix the position of Panthalassa's ancient subduction zones in time and space, the study shows. The slabs sunk vertically about 0.4 inches (1 centimeter) per year and have not shifted in space. Because geologists know the travels of North America in detail, thanks to magnetic stripes in the Atlantic Ocean, the researchers can pull back the continent and compare it to the position of subducted crust.""What this does is provide us with a time machine. The slabs are telling us the sites of past ocean trenches and the locality of island arcs, which are the building blocks of continents,"" said Mihalynuk, a geologist with the British Columbia Geological Survey in Canada.Two new platesWhat the mantle evidence shows is that as Pangaea broke up, out in the Panthalassa Ocean, a vast archipelago sat far offshore of North America. It was shaped like an arrowhead, 6,200 miles (10,000 km) long, with its tip pointing to the proto-Pacific Northwest. Two ocean basins sat between the archipelago and North America, called the Angayucham and the Mezcalera. On the other side of the archipelago, further to the west, was the Farallon plate.Instead of an Andes-style subduction zone, with the Farallon plate sliding to the east under North America, there was a westward-dipping subduction zone, with North American crust sliding beneath the Angauychum and Mezcalera plates.western north america geologic historyMake MoneyBecome a Millionare in the Stock Market following our successful Trades!!!!http://www.timing4profit.com[Pin It] The geologic history of western North America since the Jurassic, based on subducted oceanic crust.

""If there was eastward subduction, as most people would suggest, it would leave a bread crumb trail strewn out across the mantle. That's not what you see.""As North America plowed westward, with its margin sinking the two plates, it rammed into the arrow point about 150 million years ago. This impact was responsible for raising the initial Rocky Mountains, Mihalynuk said.Further west of the archipelago, the Farallon ocean plate was descending into its own subduction zone, the mantle evidence indicates.Violent tectonicsIn fact, the entire western Panthalassic was more like the Southwest Pacific, where northeast Australia collides with islands, microcontinents disappear into the Earth, and there are flip-flopping subduction zones, the study authors said.""The ocean basin was not a vast abyssal plain,"" Mihalynuk told OurAmazingPlanet. ""The situation is much more like the Southwest Pacific than offshore South America."" [World's Biggest Oceans and Seas]Over time, collisions with the different subduction zones smeared exotic terranes along the continent's western margin, a rock record that has long hinted at North America's violent tectonic history. The history revealed by the mantle slabs helps explain some baffling geology, such as rocks carried 1,200 miles (2,000 km) from Mexico to Canada.

Tech site The Register reports that a tablet 'froze' and could not be resuscitated during a demo of Microsoft's upcoming Windows 8 . The tiled 'Metro' interface does away with the 'nests' of windows familiar from earlier versions of Microsoft's OS . Touchscreen compatible - the new operating system will work with tablets and portable devices. There will also be a version for PCs. Fewer windows . - instead of 'stacks' of windows, as in previous versions, the OS is . built around clean 'tiles' that deliver information to the home screen. Free versions of Word, Excel and Powerpoint - Windows 8 will offer Office free to tablet users.

A report by security think tank The Stimson Center showed spending on tanks, ships and jets rose from $63billion in 2001 to $136billion in 2010. But the Department of Defense spent $233billion of that $1trillion from ‘supplemental’ funding voted on aside from the main defence budget. Up: A report by security think tank the Stimson Center showed spending on tanks, ships and aircraft has risen from $63billion in 2001 to $136billion last year . The report suggests the equipment of U.S. forces is in better shape than officials claim, but they still have one big reason to be afraid of cuts.

Fears are mounting at the Pentagon over budget cuts and this report suggests U.S. forces have already modernised most of their equipment. Officials are concerned likely cuts could stop them replacing equipment damaged in Iraq and Afghanistan, reported the New York Times.

Michael Gove yesterday attacked parents who send their children to school hungry, saying it was due to their ‘chaotic’ lives rather than a lack of cash. The Education Secretary said increasing numbers of children grew up with ‘guesting parents’, fleeting figures such as parents’ boyfriends or girlfriends who offer little stability. Mr Gove told a Church of England seminar hosted by the Archbishop of Canterbury that schools could be said to parent some pupils simply because they take an interest in them. He said: ‘When children arrive at school not having eaten breakfast, it’s more often or not because they’ve grown up in chaotic homes rather than the fact that the finite amount of financial resources entering that home is insufficient to ensure that the children are fed.’ He also urged the Church of England to engage more in the Coalition’s academies and free schools programme. He said: ‘I want the Church to recover the spirit which infused its educational mission in Victorian times and support more new schools to bring educational excellence to the nation’s poorest children.’ Last year Mr Gove said the state should launch an ‘early intervention’ when youngsters are at risk of being so badly damaged by their appalling childhoods. In October, Mr Gove warned that significant numbers of children arrive at primary school ‘simply incapable of learning’ because of their chaotic home lives. During a question and answer session at think-tank Politeia, he said the state must launch an ‘early intervention’ when youngsters are at risk of being so badly damaged by their appalling childhoods. Mr Gove also urged the Church of England to to engage more in the Coalition's academies and free schools programme (file picture) The Department for Education later confirmed this could include taking these youngsters into care if necessary. Months earlier, during a speech about adoption, Mr Gove said that social workers do everything they can to keep families together, but it was ‘far better’ for them to ‘follow their instincts to intervene and rescue rather than acquiesce in abusive or neglectful parenting in the hope things will improve’. Meanwhile, Ofsted’s chief inspector of schools, sparked controversy last summer when he said that thousands of children from ‘dysfunctional’ homes should be taken from their parents and put in boarding schools.","Michael Gove said schools parent some pupils just by taking an interest .

The UK, which is the world's eighth most popular holiday destination, was reprimanded by the charity for the ""highly controversial"" Justice . and Security Act, which allows secret courts and for the recent reduction in the amount of legal aid available to prisoners. The charity also says ""toxic language"" surrounding human rights is common to the UK and raises concerns about the possible scrapping of the Human Rights Act and withdrawal from the European Court of Human Rights.

This incredible picture shows the body of a two-headed fire salamander which has just been donated to a German university. The bizarre mutant lived for just six months in the collection of a private breeder who tried to feed it through both mouths. It's body was donated to the Martin Luther University in Halle. On me heads, son! This two-headed fire salamander was donated to Martin Luther University in Halle, Germany . He was never headed for anything: The poor . bicephalous creature was donated by a private breeder who had tried to keep it alive . by feeding it through both mouths . The condition of having more than one head is known as polycephaly, with two-headedness described specifically by the terms bicephaly or dicephaly. Each head of a polycephalic animal has its own brain, and they somehow share control of the organs and limbs, though the specific structure of the connections varies. Such animals often move in a disoriented and dizzy fashion, with the brains 'arguing' with each other leading some specimens to simply zig-zag without getting anywhere. In snakes, each head may attack and even attempt to swallow the other. Pin head: Dr Wolf-Rüdiger Grosse, Herpetologist and Lecturer for Evolution and . Biodiversity at Martin Luther University, takes a look at the dual-headed salamande, which was just six months old when it died . Fire salamanders are probably the best-known salamander species in Europe and are native to forests in the centre and south of the continent. They can have incredibly long lifespans, with one specimen living for more than 50 years in the Museum Konig, a German natural history museum. Their unusual name is believed to stem from old tales of the amphibians, which sometimes hide within holes and crevices in damp wood and tree trunks. When woodsmen cut down such wood to make fires in the forest, heat would force any salamanders hiding within to dart away. Legend: Fire salamanders were once believed to be born from flames after people saw them emerging from logs which they had cut for use as fire wood. One imagines what they would have thought of this beast . This gave them the appearance of 'crawling from within the flames' and led to the belief that they were formed from fire. This double-headed salamander was pictured last week as it was handed over to researchers at Martin Luther University. Just six months old when it died, it was born into the collection of a private lizard breeder who had attempted to raise the animal by feeding both heads separately.","Mutant lived for just six months in the collection of a private breeder .

Leading researchers have warned family doctors are wasting time on the 'worried well' instead of treating people who are actually sick (file picture) NHS health checks offered to the over-40s are useless, causing needless worry and diverting resources from  sick patients, it was claimed yesterday. But health ministers insisted that the flagship £300million-a-year screening programme could save up to 650 lives each year and prevent 1,600 heart attacks and strokes by spotting warning signs early. Launched in 2009 for people aged 40 to 74, it has led to 1.3million receiving a health ‘MoT’ over the last year. It is now to be rolled out across England after being tested in a variety of areas. But Danish researchers claim the Health Check Programme operates in ‘direct conflict with the best available evidence’ and is likely to lead to patients taking drugs they do not need. Researchers from the Nordic Cochrane Centre analysed 14 international trials involving 183,000 people receiving routine checks but found none of them cut deaths, kept people out of hospital or prevented disability. As a result of the study, the Danish Government has reversed its plan for regular checks. And following concerns, a review of the NHS breast screening programme last year concluded that for every life saved by screening, four women underwent unnecessary surgery. The latest study comes as the Government steps up its plan to make the NHS less of a sickness service and more pro-active. But psychiatrists have already labelled plans to screen for early dementia among older people  visiting their GPs for other reasons ‘a disaster in slow motion’ because patients without symptoms could be wrongly diagnosed. While GPs have backed this dementia scheme,  Dr Clare Gerada, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said she was concerned about mass health screening. ‘Through mass screening of untargeted populations, we are identifying risk factors, not diseases, and it is inevitable that we will  identify people who might have “abnormalities”,’ she said. ‘These will usually disappear or turn out to be irrelevant, but we run the risk of putting people on unnecessary medication or worrying them unduly.’ Researchers from the Nordic Cochrane Centre say the Health Check programme 'operates in direct conflict with the best available evidence' and is likely to lead to patients taking drugs they do not need (file picture) Health Minister Norman Lamb said the screening programme tackled . the shocking variation in health outcomes across the country, and was . shifting the system from dealing only with the effects of illness to . also  promoting wellness. ‘We could save 650 lives a year, prevent 1,600 . heart attacks and strokes, and prevent over 4,000 new cases of diabetes . if there was full take-up,’ he said. ‘Early research findings and . experience are positive that NHS Health Checks are reaching those most . in need and helping to reduce their risk of ill health.’ Barbara . Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, also supports routine checks, . saying they could uncover an estimated 850,000 people with undiagnosed . Type 2 diabetes. Clare Gerada, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, backed the centre's calls to end routine checks, saying they 'devalued medicine' She said: ‘Far from being useless, there is good . evidence that, if properly implemented, it could prevent thousands of . cases of Type 2 diabetes a year, as well as having a positive impact for . heart disease, kidney disease and stroke. ‘And while the £300million . it costs to run might sound like a lot of money, diabetes and other . chronic conditions are expensive to treat. ‘This means that once you . factor in the savings in healthcare costs, the NHS Health Check is . actually expected to save the NHS about £132million per year.’ Although . many patients like the ‘insurance’ value of a health check, figures . last month showed that  less than half of those invited for one (49 per . cent) attended the appointment. The aim is 70 to 75 per cent. Dr Paul . Cosford, medical director at Public Health England, said: ‘We know . there is a huge burden of  disease associated with conditions such as . heart disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease. ‘Many of these . long-term conditions can be avoided through modifications in people’s . behaviour and  lifestyles, and this is what the NHS Health Check . programme aims  to do.’","£300 million-a-year scheme to be rolled out across UK .

Some of the U.S. and Asia's largest cities are predicted to be among the most susceptible to coastal flooding in the world, scientists have warned. Researchers say that New York, Miami, New Orleans and Boston in the U.S. are all among the top 20 cities at the highest risk of coastal flooding and could all find themselves facing extensive and frequent flood damage if sea levels rise to predicted levels by 2050. Even if sea levels rose to the best-case scenarios predicted by scientists, the yearly global cost of repairing damage caused by coastal foods could top $1 trillion, according to the study. Researchers warned New York, Miami, New Orleans and Boston in the U.S. are all among the top 20 cities at the highest risk of coastal flooding and could all find themselves facing flood damage if sea levels rise to predicted levels by 2050 . A team at the University of Southampton looked at 136 coastal cities with more than 1 million residents as well as the population distribution, types of flood protection in place and elevation of storms. To compile the top 20 list, they combined data about the cities with sea level predictions for 2050, plus economic and population forecasts to calculate the cost of the damage based upon the depth of water that could cover a city.

So that's really not an option.' The study said that if cities did bolster their flood prevention measures, such as erecting storm surge barriers, increasing the height of levees, flood-proofing buildings and converting low-lying areas to parks or fileds, the cost of damage could be lowered to around $50 billion a year. Many climate change scientists have predicted that cities will be battered by increasingly fierce and frequent storms over the coming decades and some have suggested that we are already seeing the effects in storms such as Hurricane Sandy.

Nicholls reportedly believes it is prudent for cities to put measures in place as soon as possible to prevent vast amounts of damage created by extreme weather events becoming the norm. He said: 'The bottom line is it shows that flood risk is rising today — it's happening. 'All these cities need to be preparing for that.' The research is part of an ongoing project by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and is being led by Dr Stephane Hallegatte, from the World Bank.","Scientists warned five U.S. cities are predicted to be among the most susceptible to coastal flooding in the world .

A reporter for My9nj had to first gain the people's trust before they would take her on a tour of their community among the trees . Reporter Meg Baker, from My9NJ, was told about the so called tent city by volunteers at the Christian Caring Centre, which provides food and services for the homeless in the woods. It has been reported that it costs taxpayers around $14,480 per year to care for a single homeless person. Many of those living in the woods are alcoholics who said they could not afford to pay rent and live on their own and so were 'forced to be there'. But Christian Caring Centre volunteer Tracy Janusz said it far from a countryside idyll, adding: 'No young person should have to see what is going on there.' Many of them told her that while they were still able to claim state benefits, they were not enough to afford low income housing, and so they had no other choice but to sleep rough .

British troops have been attacking Taliban fighters in secret raids months after the military officially stopped offensive operations in Afghanistan. Paratroopers and Royal Marines in the Special Forces Support Group have teamed up with Afghan commandos in Helmand province. The elite fighters take on Taliban bomb-makers, launching several raids a week in an attempt to drive the extremists out of the area. On the front line: British troops are fighting the Taliban in secret raids, it has emerged (file photo) Details of the previously unknown operations were revealed by a senior officer in the unit writing in Pegasus, the Parachute Regiment's in-house journal. He wrote that the SFSG's A Company was deployed to Afghanistan in January for a six-month tour, during which it was involved in two or three offensives against the Taliban each week. Up to 150 British troops joined up with Task Force 444, a group of elite commandos from the Afghan National Army, according to the Daily Telegraph. They aimed to cripple the Taliban's bomb-making abilities and block insurgents' supply lines near the border with Pakistan, according to the anonymous officer. He revealed his satisfaction at taking part in combat operations, writing: 'Killing the enemy in the close battle is exactly what we joined up to do.' Pledge: Officers and ministers have insisted that the British forces are no longer involved in combat . The officer also praised the men from the unit, saying they were working 'above their pay grade' and had impressed their fellow fighters. However, he added that 'the Afghanistan burden is heavy', with many Afghan soldiers killed in action and British troops suffering 'life-changing injuries'. Earlier this year, senior military commanders claimed that British forces were no longer involved in combat operations in Helmand, after more than a decade of fighting in the region. Officials have insisted that the Afghan army is now in control of operations, with British troops taking an advisory role. However, the latest revelation casts doubt on that claim, suggesting that British forces are still fighting on the front line. All Nato combat troops are due to leave Afghanistan by the end of next year, leaving only support staff advising the country's military.","Paratroopers and Marines team up with elite Afghan commandos for raids .

Relieved: A laughing Jim Davidson put on a confident performance in Torquay yesterday despite his ordeal . Jim Davidson made his first live performance yesterday after being told he is to face no further action over allegations he sexually assaulted ten women - as it was revealed he was offered a 'mind-blowing' deal to join Celebrity Big Brother as soon as the allegations were dropped. The veteran comedian turned down the offer because he still faces one claim. Mr Davidson confidently strolled onstage to applause and cheers from hundreds of fans at the Princess Theatre in Torquay, Devon, where he performed a series of his famous controversial gags as part of his You Must Be Joking tour. The former Big Break host began the adult-only show with the words: 'No further action' - to which the crowd burst into claps and whoops. Mr Davidson said: 'It's weird that you're all clapping as if I have won something when really nothing has changed. The police have decided no further action and I'm very pleased.' The 59-year-old then thanked his fans for all their support, and added: 'To those of you that have bothered writing and twittering, thank you. 'It's been nine months of murder really but the great thing about being innocent is that all you've got is the truth, you can't make anything up so I was f*****.' Mr Davidson was arrested in January and again in March as part of Operation Yewtree, the inquiry launched in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal. But the Crown Prosecution Service last night said the women's allegations were not strong enough for there to be a realistic prospect of securing a conviction. When he heard the news, Mr Davidson said: 'I'm very pleased that it has now all blown over.' Mr Davidson told a reporter sat outside his £850,000 riverside home in Stockbridge, Hampshire, that he was back to work as normal. Speaking over the phone, he said: 'I'm in Torquay at the moment, preparing for a performance tonight. 'I'm very pleased there's going to be no further action. 'The police contacted my lawyer who informed me yesterday that I wouldn't be facing further action. Reprieve: Jim Davidson said he was pleased his ordeal had 'blown over' 'I'm very pleased that it has now all blown over. I have no further comment to make.' He added: I've been through tough times before and got through, and I will come through this. It will all be fine.' A TV source said: 'Channel Five were absolutely desperate to get Jim on as they know what a controversial figure he can be and were convinced he would make great viewing.' Celebrity Big Brother started last night with stars including ex-Corrie actor Bruce Jones. Bosses have not ruled out Davidson joining the house if his final allegation - an alleged indecent assault on a woman in the Falkland Islands in the 1980s - is dropped, according to The Sun. It is up to the Falklands’ attorney general Mark Lewis to consult lawyers before deciding whether he should be prosecuted. He is due to play the Princess Theatre in Torquay, Devon, tonight as part of his 'You Must Be Joking' tour. Last night a woman in her late-fifties answered the door of his Georgian home, claiming to be a neighbour who was house-sitting. She said: 'We are all thrilled to hear no further action is being taken against Jim. We are really pleased for him.' Mr Davidson has consistently denied the allegations against him, which included one dating back 35 years.

It is feared the animal inside a hyperbaric chamber began kicking its steel clad hooves to get out and created a spark that caused a major explosion. Tragedy: Newlywed Erica Marshall, 28, was monitoring a horse receiving oxygen therapy when the animal kicked through the wall of the pressurised hyperbaric chamber . Tribute: Yesterday Erica's husband Kieran, of Corsham, Wilts., paid a heartfelt tribute to his 'best friend' who died 'doing what she loved' Explosion: Investigators said the horse accidentally caused the explosion while being treated in a high oxygen chamber when it began kicking its steel clad hooves to get out and created a spark that caused a major explosion . Fatal: The blast that killed 28 year old Erica Marshall and injured Sorcha Moneley, 33, was so loud it was heard over 30 miles away from Ocala, Florida . The horse died instantly while the blast also killed 28-year-old Erica Marshall, one of the workers at the equine rehab centre. Sorcha Moneley, 33, from Ireland, was also injured in the blast which was so loud it was heard over 30 miles away from Ocala, Florida. Yesterday her husband Kieran, of Corsham, Wilts., paid a heartfelt tribute to his 'best friend' who died 'doing what she loved'. He said: 'Erica was such a kind and generous woman. 'She only cared about other people and wouldn't want all this fuss but that was Erica, she was selfless.' The equine expert, who is originally from Medford in New Jersey, USA, met her husband while studying equine science at Hartpury College near Gloucester, England. They married in November and moved to Ocala in Florida in 2010 after she was was offered a role at at the Kentucky Equine Sports and Rehabilitation Centre. Investigators said the horse was being treated inside the chamber with pure oxygen. The horse, which has been treated in the chamber on four previous occasions, had not been sedated. Happier times: Rhonda Stroup, a Marion sheriff detective, confirmed the horse kicked off a protective shield inside of the oxygen-filled chamber. She said that there was nothing the women could do because it happened so fast . Grief: Two women console each other after the incident - Erica Marshall's husband said she died doing what she loved while friends left messages of support on her Facebook page . It managed to kick through the padding inside the chamber to the outside metal wall. As its metal shoe scrapped along the wall it created a spark which ignited the pure oxygen. Rhonda Stroup, a Marion sheriff detective, confirmed the horse kicked off a protective shield inside of the oxygen-filled chamber. Stroup described it as a 'horribly huge explosion,' and added that there was nothing the women could do because it happened so fast. The horse owner lives in Virginia and the animal was spending the winter in Florida. Stroup said the horse was put into chamber to be treated for a condition called EPM. The horse had been in the chamber approximately four times and had never had any problems, so they didn't give the horse a tranquilizer. Marshall had been running the chamber for two years as part of her daily job, officials said. Stroup said Marshall had treated two to six horses every day. Horses are typically treated in a hyperbaric chamber on the recommendation of a vet. Hyperbaric chambers are designed to push highly pressurized, pure oxygen into tissue to speed up recovery times for certain injuries. Deputies said Marshall died at the scene. Moneley was airlifted to Shands Hospital in Gainesville with serious injuries and underwent surgery. About 30 other horses were at the rehabilitation center when the explosion occurred and were not harmed.","Erica Marshall, 28, had married her husband in November last year .

Jones banned her daughter from seeing him after he erupted into a . jealous rage on a night out when he had stopped Faye from dancing, told . her she looked like ‘a slut’ and choked her. Faye, who completed her GCSEs this . summer, later packed a suitcase and was seen driving away from the . apartment with Ertani while her mother gave chase. One of her friends, who was slapped . by Ertani during the nightclub incident, said the teenager only ran away . with him because he had threatened to harm her and her mother.

Turkey, but the relationship quickly went sour in 2011. She moved back to Stirling after she . said she was attacked by Ertani and forced to live in apartments without . electricity and water. It was then that she discovered she was pregnant with her son Aydin, who is now 18 months old. Ertani then became ‘violent and aggressive as he was drinking all the time’, she said. ‘He would lock me in the apartment for hours on end while he went out to get drunk and then he’d come home and attack me.’ Relationship: Faye met Can when she visited Marmaris last year and they kept in touch on Facebook .

Tragedy: Maria Pantazopoulos, 30, died while posing for photographs in her wedding dress in a river . A newlywed who drowned during a photo shoot in her wedding dress was purposefully in the water to take part in a popular ritual called 'Trash the Dress', it has emerged. The practice, in which brides pose for pictures while playfully destroying their wedding gowns, had tragic consequences for Maria Pantazopoulos, when she was dragged under the water by the weight of her soaked dress. 'I can't anymore, it's too heavy,' she cried before letting go of the photographer and slipping under to her death, the Toronto Sun reported. The 30-year-old  real estate agent, who had just bought a home with her new husband, was pulled into the Ouareau . River near Dorwin Falls, north of Montreal, on Friday afternoon. Her . body was found about two-and-a-half hours later. Her bridal gown and high-heeled wedding shoes were later pictured lying on rocks along the river bed. Ms Pantazopoulos had commissioned the shoot . following her June 9 wedding and instructed the photographer, Louis Pagakis, to snap away while she was in the water. 'At one point, she told him, ""I want you to take some photos of me floating in the water"",' the photographer's wife, Anouk Benzacar, said. But within moments of climbing in she realised that the weight of the soaked wedding dress was pulling her under. Horror: Pantazopoulos' wedding dress and shoes remain on the rocks after she was dragged under water to her death while posing for pictures as part of a popular 'Trash the Dress' ritual . Killed: A scuba diver found her body around 30 meters from her original posing place . 'She was screaming and scratching and trying to stay above water, Benzacar said. '[Louis] tried to swim with her, but she was pulling him down. She was too heavy. He couldn't breathe anymore.' Pagakis told CTV Montreal that he did everything he could to save her. 'She . had her wedding dress on and she said, ""take some pictures of me while I . swim a little bit in the lake,""' he said. 'She went in and her dress got heavy, I . tried everything I could to save her.' Leeza Pousoulidis told the Montreal Gazette her friend wanted 'Trash the Dress' photographs. Struggle: Rescue teams attempted to save Pantazopoulos, but her body was found two hours later . Crime scene: Police found her body at 6pm on Friday after she failed to stay above water in the heavy dress . 'She’s a really fun girl, and she just didn’t want her wedding dress . sitting in a box in the closet,' she said. 'She said ""I want to have fun with my wedding dress. I want to have great pictures and memories of me in my wedding dress.""' The soaked dress would have weighed at least 100 pounds, provincial policeman Jean-Michel Masse said. 'It was like an anvil,' he added to the QMI news agency. Pantazopoulos had just bought a house in the picturesque city of Laval, Quebec with her husband, Billy, and they had planned on starting a family right away, friends told the Sun. Ms Pousoulidis said her friend was 'a strong, tough girl'. 'She was very petite, but she was strong in character and in physical strength as well. She was very happy and caring. She had a big heart.' Quebec provincial police spokesman . Sgt. Ronald McInnis described the site as being elevated and rocky, with . water 'violently' rushing below. Distraught: Photographer Louis Pagakis said that he did everything he could to save Ms Pantazopoulos . Plunge: She was pulled into the Ouareau River near Dorwin Falls, north of Montreal in Canada . 'She . was doing the photo shoot in about six inches or one foot of water when . part of her wedding dress got soaked and became extremely heavy,' Mr McInnis told MailOnline. 'She . started slipping and falling down when the photographer grabbed her but . she was too heavy that he couldn't pull her from the edge. 'Another person tried to grab her but also was unable to save her from falling into the river.' Mr McInnis . said Ms Pantazopoulos, from Laval, a small Island north of Montreal, was . found 100 feet from where she fell by a private diver who knows the . river and volunteered to help with the search. The . diver pulled the young woman’s body from an area of the river which was 20 feet deep. Loss: Pantazopoulos, a real estate agent, had just bought a home with her new husband, Billy . Ritual: This file picture shows a bride taking part in the 'Trash the Dress' phenomenon . 'She had sunk to the bottom,' Mr McInnis said. Two witnesses, the photographer and an assistant, were hospitalised for extreme shock. Mr McInnis . said the bride's husband was not present for the photo-shoot and . neither were any family members. However, her cousins and her brother went to the site when they heard that she had died. 'It's horrible,' Mr McInnis said. 'This is the first time I've heard of a . story like that. I told my partner, this is a story that is going to go . all around the world.' Ms Pantazopoulos's family has declined to speak to the media.","Maria Pantazopoulos, 30, died after posing for pictures on Friday .

They . went from their forward mounting base in Wellington Barracks into Green . Park, where 71 horses pulled six First World War-era 13-pounder field . guns into position for the royal salute at 2pm. Each . of the six guns fired blank artillery rounds at 10-second intervals . until a total of 41 shots were fired. The horses and riders then . collected the guns and escorted them back to Wellington Barracks. Major Mark Edward, commanding officer . of the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery, said: 'The opportunity to . mark the birth of the child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge by . firing a 41-gun royal salute, comes as a huge honour for the King's . Troop Royal Horse Artillery.' Tribute: The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery let off a 41-gun salute from Green Park near Buckingham Palace . Military: The Army fires a salute every time a Prince or Princess is born - the last one was 23 years ago . The Honourable Artillery Company . (HAC), the City of London's Army Reserve Regiment, also fired a 62-gun . salute from Gun Wharf at the Tower of London at 2pm. Whilst a royal gun salute normally comprises 21 guns, this is increased to 41 if fired from a royal park or residence. Uniquely, . at the Tower of London, which is a royal residence, 62 rounds are fired . as this also includes an additional 21 guns for the citizens of the . City of London to show their loyalty to the monarch. Bells . also sounded at Westminster Abbey in celebration of the royal birth, . with the three ringers having performed the same task for the new . Prince's father more than 30 years ago. Smoke: The drama and pageantry of this afternoon's event was befitting of the royal birth . When the Duke of Cambridge was born . in June 1982, Clarke Walters helped ring a peal at the iconic church in . central London in honour of the newest member of the royal family. Mr Walters said it was 'wonderful' to now be performing the peal for William's own baby son. He also rang the celebratory bells for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding at the Abbey two years ago. A . team of 10 from the Westminster Abbey Company of Ringers rang a full . peal on the Abbey's 10 bells from 2pm to coincide with the gun salute in . Green Park. The complex peal is made of 5,000 changes, and known as the Cambridge Surprise Royal and lasts for over three hours. Duty: The artillery were celebrating the arrival of Britain's future King with their traditional salute . March: The soldiers paraded from their base past Buckingham Palace to the gun stations in Green Park . Mr Walters said: 'It's always a great honour to ring at the Abbey especially for a big occasion like this one. It's a bit of a thrill even though I've been ringing for more than 30 years. 'I do love the connection that three of us rang the peal for William's birth, the same three were in the wedding peal and the same three are here today. That's a nice link back to William.' Celebrations are not confined to London, as all of Her Majesty's ships - in home or international waters - are flying the Royal Navy Ensign flag from their mast to mark the birth of the prince. HMS Lancaster, deployed on a patrol task in the Caribbean, added its own congratulatory message to the Duke and Duchess, spelling out 'It's A Boy!' on the deck of the ship. Commanding officer Commander Steve Moorhouse said: 'As ""the Queen's Frigate"" we were particularly delighted to hear the fantastic news of the royal birth and everybody on board HMS Lancaster sends their warmest congratulations and best wishes to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.' Majestic: The military horses flooded in to Green Park in the early afternoon today . Special moment: This is the first time in 23 years that the salute has been fired for a Royal birth . Staff from RAF Valley, where Prince . William serves as a search and rescue pilot, were among the first to . offer their congratulations. Station commander Group Captain Adrian Hill sent a congratulatory message to the couple on behalf of the RAF Valley. 'We're . all delighted to learn that Flight Lieutenant Wales and the Duchess of . Cambridge are now proud parents of a new-born son,' he said. 'We wish them all the very best for the future. From everyone at RAF Valley, congratulations.' Preparation: Earlier this month the Honourable Artillery Company were pictured cleaning their guns . Hard at work: They polished the guns to ensure they would be sparkling for the salute . The Ministry of Defence said other units connected to WIlliam also marked the birth, including the Army regiment he was commissioned into from Sandhurst, the Household Cavalry, which is partly deployed in Afghanistan. The Irish Guards, of which William is the colonel, toasted the birth with a traditional glass of Irish stout at their barracks in Aldershot and at bases in London. Kate visited the battalion this year and last year to present shamrocks to all ranks on St Patrick's Day, a role carried out for many years by a female member of the Royal Family. Commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Ed Boanas said: 'On behalf of all ranks 1st Battalion Irish Guards, I send our warmest congratulations and best wishes to the Colonel of the Regiment and HRH the Duchess of Cambridge on the occasion of the birth of their son, with the heartfelt hope that he has a long and happy life.

Not long now: Members of the press are forced to wait in the pouring rain for the first glimpse of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their newborn son outside St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, west London, today . Trafalgar Square's famous fountains were lit with blue lights last night and London mayor Boris Johnson said they will be lit for the next six days in celebration of the royal birth. 'Huge congratulations to the Duke and Duchess on the birth of their first child who will, by virtue of being born in this great city, be a Londoner through and through,' he said. 'I am sure millions of Londoners will be raising a glass today to toast this wonderful news.' Westminster City Council celebrated the announcement of the baby boy's birth with blue lighting in the fountains in Marble Arch and the Golden Jubilee Bridge.

The Baptist church had been hosting a soup kitchen for the homeless and was in the process of serving meals to more than 100 people when the men were shot outside. Three of the men were members of a local gang and it is believed the incident was a hit by a rival group, but ‘at least two’ of the victims had been at the charity meal. Scene: The five men were gunned down at the bus stop outside Uptown Baptist Church which was holding a meal-service for homeless . The men, aged from 21 to 58, were standing at a bus stop near the church and were wounded by a round of bullets with a suspected assault weapon around 6pm Monday. 'We heard the barrage of shots outside. There must have been at least 15 to 20 shots fired, and then after that, I went out to find out what was going on, and just saw carnage at the base of the church steps,’ Pastor Michael Allen of Uptown Baptist Church told CBS local. According to witnesses a white car drove up to the bus stop and fired several rounds of bullets. Pastor Allen said he believed ‘at least two or three’ victims had either just left his charity meal prayer service or were on the way there. Street battle: It is believed the shooting was part of an ongoing gang-rivalry in the area as three of the men were reportedly members of local groups . The pastor said he had served over 100 people in need on Monday night and stepped outside to find the victims in pools of blood on the church doorstep. ‘I heard what I thought was fireworks,’ witness Joe Rogers told CBS. ‘I see three people down on the ground; one on his back, one on his side, and one is face down.’ The church is located on the border between two gang territories and police say three different gangs in the Uptown area have been fighting for power of its streets. Police have yet to arrest anyone for Monday’s shooting. The victims’ conditions ranged from extremely critical to critical to good, the Chicago Fire Department said in on Twitter.","Five men shot  with automatic weapon outside Chicago church .

Hospital managers behind one of the worst health scandals in living memory won glowing praise from the head of the NHS. At the height of the Mid Staffordshire scandal, Sir David Nicholson toured wards and in a follow-up letter said ‘well done’ for ‘progress in target areas’. The visit came in October 2005 – a year in which 300 patients are thought to have died because of poor care. By 2009, the total stood at 1,200. At the height of the Mid Staffordshire scandal, Sir David Nicholson toured wards and in a follow-up letter said 'well done' for 'progress in target areas' Bereaved families, who are calling for Sir David to quit, say many lives could have been spared had he investigated the health trust. In other developments in the NHS crisis: . The letter obtained by the Mail shows the NHS chief visited Mid Staffordshire’s two hospitals – Stafford and Cannock Chase – while he was in charge of the regional health board. It is thought the visit was on October 27 and was followed by a letter of congratulation to the chief executive. It noted improvements on hitting targets for waiting times in casualty, cancer treatment, surgery and outpatients. Yet that month an elderly woman who had suffered a stroke was sent home by a casualty doctor who misdiagnosed her as having a urine infection. The visit came in October 2005 ¿ a year in which 300 patients are thought to have died because of poor care. By 2009, the total stood at 1,200 . She fell into a coma two days later and died. Julie Bailey, who set up the campaign group Cure the NHS after her mother died at the trust, said: ‘He should have been asking questions of the trust’s chief executive, not congratulating him. ‘The care was just disastrous from 2004 and it became a longstanding problem. He is ultimately responsible. How can he carry on in his job after all this?’ Last week Sir David was implicated in another scandal when it emerged he had ignored warnings about a hospital trust where 670 patients may have died needlessly. Gary Walker and David Bowles, the former chief executive and chairman of United Lincolnshire Hospitals, say they wrote to the chief executive in 2009 but were ignored. Mr Walker was later sacked and given a £500,000 pay-off with a gagging clause to keep silent. The trust is being investigated by the NHS for having one of the highest death rates in the country. Yesterday, the Prime Minister added to the pressure by saying the NHS needed to act on problems ‘much more swiftly’. Mr Cameron said there had been ‘no accountability’ for the failings at Mid Staffordshire with those responsible being allowed to quietly retire or move on. Speaking from Mumbai, he added: ‘There wasn’t proper accountability. There weren’t proper consequences and that is not acceptable.’ Last week Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt wrote to all health trusts urging them not to use gagging orders to deter whistleblowing. Asked about this, the Prime Minister said: ‘I agree with what Jeremy Hunt has said over the last couple of days. You shouldn’t need to rely on whistleblowing in the NHS, we should be discovering problems much more swiftly. We should be discovering them as they occur.’ Gary Walker (left) and David Bowles (right), the former chief executive and chairman of United Lincolnshire Hospitals, say they wrote to the chief executive in 2009 but were ignored . Mr Cameron said the Government was trying to get hospital trusts to provide better care by asking patients whether they would recommend them to their friends and family. But he made clear where this fails, there is a case for whistleblowing: ‘That’s what the transparency agenda is about. That’s what the friends and family test is about, that’s what boosting the Care Quality Commission is all about. That’s what the chief inspector of hospitals is all about. Sir David has been facing increasing calls to resign since a report into the Mid Staffordshire scandal was published earlier this month. Sir David also appointed the trust’s failed chief executive Martin Yeates – even though he had no formal managerial training and went on to sack 50 nurses. Later, as chief executive of the Department of Health, he is said to have dismissed warnings from relatives. He apparently told a watchdog investigating the hospital trust not to pay too much attention to the concerns of the families as they were ‘simply lobbying’. Up to 1,200 patients are thought to have died unnecessarily at Mid Staffordshire and many hundreds of others suffered ‘inhumane’ and ‘inexcusable’ care. Sir David, who earns £211,000 a year, has resisted calls to resign, saying the failures have been ‘system wide’. But last week two Tory MPs from the health select committee, Chris Skidmore and Sarah Wollaston, urged him to consider his position. An online petition on a Government website calling on him to go has received 3,796 signatures. A spokesman for Sir David Nicholson said: ‘Sir David took on responsibility for the Shropshire and Staffordshire Health Authority for just ten months, along with being chief executive of two other health authorities. ‘There was no information that he saw during that time that alerted him to the problems at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust.’","Sir David .

"By . Andrew Levy . UPDATED: . 17:13 EST, 1 September 2011 . Travellers at an illegal site in Essex have erected a second watchtower today as the battle lines are drawn in their fight against eviction. Residents at the Dale Farm site have also strengthened other parts of the site after they lost an 11th hour legal challenge yesterday to halt the eviction. The moves have heightened fears that there will be a violent outcome to the dispute, which has lasted for ten years. Look out: This second watchtower was constructed today by travellers at the camp as they tried to avoid eviction . Resistance: The Dale Farm travellers say that they won't go quietly if police move in and have begun to barricade the entrances in Crays Hill, Essex. Many locals fear the situation will turn ugly . Aerial photos of the site at Crays Hill also appear to show that large parts of the area are already unoccupied, sparking fears the travellers could end up being evicted only to move 50 yards down the road. One anarchist who has joined the travellers at the site said:  'There is no way we are leaving them here . to be attacked by the thugs who pass themselves off as bailiffs. 'Yes, we are preparing for battle and want here to be our fortress - What other option have these people been left with? 'A life in supermarket carparks is no future for these good people.' Earlier today, Basildon Council . leader Tony Ball made a last ditch appeal for the 1,000 or so travellers . to leave peacefully, and avoid the need for bailiffs to move in. Mr Ball said: 'I am making a final appeal to the residents to leave Dale Farm peacefully. 'I . would also ask any visitors to the site or anyone who truly has the . travellers' interests at heart to urge them to do this as well. Parked: On the day that travellers should be moving out of Dale Farm, Essex there is little sign of movement at the camp . Big issue: Dale Farm is the largest Romany Gypsy and Irish Traveller site in the UK . 'Direct action to clear Dale Farm is a last resort for the council and we take it reluctantly - but after almost 10 years of legal wrangling, the travellers have left us with absolutely no choice. 'This settlement has been illegally developed on greenbelt land. By doing this and failing to comply with various enforcement notices over a period of years, the travellers have broken the law. 'By taking this action we are not discriminating against the people on Dale Farm - we are treating them the same as we would any other resident in the local area who built on or developed greenbelt land without permission. 'We now have a difficult operation which we will carry out in a safe and lawful fashion. Protest: The residents of Dale Farm say the eviction is a massive waste of public money and that they will put up resistance if police try to force them out . Evictions: Resident Mary Flynn talks to reporters at Dale Farm where local authorities will be clearing their homes . Save our homes: Patrick Sheridan, aged seven, poses in his Power Rangers' outfit at the entrance to Camp Constant at Dale Farm where his family will soon be moved on from . 'We will continue to offer housing . assistance to those who may become homeless as a result of the clearance . and we will work closely with other agencies such as the NHS to provide . necessary support for the more vulnerable members of the community . during the operation. He added that action will only take place after the travellers have been informed of the date of the operation. For a number of months now the site – which the travellers bought . and then built on without planning permission – had already been . fortified in an attempt to deter forced removals. Officers believe these fortifications . are now being strengthened. There is barbed wire and scaffolding at the . perimeter and guarded gateways. High-pressure canisters have been stockpiled which could be detonated, causing serious injury or even death. Support: Actress Vanessa Redgrave arrives at the High Court for a last-ditch attempt to prevent evictions at the illegal traveller site at Dale Farm, Essex . Backing: Vanessa Redgrave speaks to the media at Dale Farm alongside traveller Mary Ann McCarthy, second left, and Dale Farm supporter Anne Kobayashi . Controversial cause: The actress commends a campaigner . Large tyres have been placed at . strategic points as barriers – although it is believed these will be . doused with petrol and set alight. Travellers had already threatened all-out war if anyone tried to evict them. An Essex police source said: ‘Up to . 2,000 people from 30 different groups could turn up, according to . intelligence from a number of sources including social networking . websites. ‘The residents of Dale Farm won’t be . able to control these groups. Some are getting worried about that. There . is anxiety that they have created a monster they cannot control. I . think some people will come to Dale Farm who will be intent on . violence.’ A traveller living on one of the . legal plots next to the farm said he feared that the protest could be . hijacked by the anarchists and other outsiders. ‘It’s your right to defend your home . but that’s not what these people are here for,’ he said. ‘I don’t want . them here and others think the same.’ The 50 who have already made their . way to the sprawling green belt site have set up their headquarters on a . plot referred to as Camp Constant. One is understood to have worn a . balaclava throughout a meeting with police to protect his identity in a . disturbing echo of the way troublemakers disguised themselves at the . student protests earlier this year and the recent countrywide looting . and rioting. Unconfirmed reports suggested UK . Uncut, whose members occupied Fortnum and Mason in Piccadilly in March . as violent groups split from a peaceful march against cuts, could be . among them. Support: Miss Redgrave visits Gratton Puxton, far left, baby Caitlin Mcarthy and her mother at the site ahead of the eviction . Vanessa Redgrave with a traveller of the camp outside the High Court . Conservative MP Priti Patel, who . represents Withan in Essex, said: ‘This is yet another example of the . political Left encouraging law-breaking and shows they are out of touch . with all the local communities in Essex who have been affected by . illegal traveller sites. ‘We need to see strong action taken . to protect families living near these sites, not Left-wingers trawling . the bottom of the barrel to find spurious excuses for them to stay.’ Basildon District Council has spent . ten years trying to remove around 500 travellers from Dale Farm after . they settled beside dozens of legal plots. It ended up in the Court of Appeal . last year when 80 families on 52 plots were ordered to leave. The . council issued a 28-day notice to leave the camp which expired at . midnight last night. It said it would be ‘checking compliance’ in the . coming days. But police insiders fear that when . council-appointed bailiffs arrive it will either trigger bloodshed or . lead to a lengthy stand-off. Vanessa Redgrave, 74, the actress and . prominent Left-wing campaigner, was among supporters at the High Court . yesterday as the travellers made a last-ditch attempt to stop the . eviction. But the action failed. The case hinged on the treatment of . 72-year-old site resident Mary Flynn, who suffers from breathing . problems and uses an electric nebuliser. Mr Justice Kenneth Parker said Court . of Appeal proceedings, which considered human rights law and concluded . the council’s decision to evict was legal, was of ‘crucial . significance’. Miss Redgrave visited the camp on . Tuesday to praise the ‘strong, wise, warm and gentle community’ and say . she hoped ‘humanity would triumph’. Last stand: Supporters and residents of the Dale Farm travellers' site stand on the steps of The High Court as they challenge their eviction order . Fighting to stay: The local authority Basildon Council say they will clear the camp of illegal dwellings, despite pleas from the travellers .","50 anarchists have already joined travellers at Dale Farm in Crays Hill, Essex .

"By . Chris Parsons . UPDATED: . 11:35 EST, 6 January 2012 . Afghan President Hamid Karzai demanded today that the U.S. detention center at Bagram Air Base be handed over to his country's control in the next month. Karzai also demanded that all Afghan citizens held by the coalition troops across the nation should be returned. A presidential statement released today said that keeping Afghan citizens imprisoned without trial violates the country's constitution, as well as international human rights conventions. Unfair: Afghan president Hamid Karzai said keeping his country's citizens in the Bagram detention center violates Afghanistan's constitution . The prison, inside the sprawling U.S. base at Bagram north of Kabul, abuts a well-known public detention center known as Parwan, which is run jointly by Afghan authorities and the U.S. military. It's unclear how many high-value detainees are being held at the U.S. facility. Human rights groups have claimed that detainees were menaced, forced to strip naked and kept in solitary confinement in windowless cells. Last year, it was revealed that a secret second facility separate to Bagram was being used near the Air Force Base to detain prisoners. The 'black jail' was established in 2002 and consisted of windowless concrete cells. In May 2010 the International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed the site's existence with the military. Reports told how detainees were held at the 'black sites' in cold cells where a light is on all day and night. Men held there were said to have been deprived of sleep of U.S military personnel there, while the cells were also filled with a constant noise. Scores of Afghans alleged suffering physical and psychological abuse at the hands of the U.S. military inside the 'black sites', while it is thought detainees there were subjected to tougher interrogation than others elsewhere at Bagram. In response to the 2010 allegations, Vice Admiral Robert Harward, in charge of US detentions in Afghanistan, denied the existence of such a facility or abuses. A statement from Karzai's office said he issued instructions to a commission consisting of the ministers of defense, interior and justice, as well as other top government and judicial officials, 'to complete their job regarding the handing over of the (Bagram) prison and other prisoners who are held by foreign forces.' 'The work should be completed within a month,' it said. The U.S.-led NATO coalition is gradually handing over responsibility for security to the Afghan police and army. The process is due to be completed in 2014, when most foreign troops are scheduled to be withdrawn from Afghanistan. Karzai's demands are the most recent in a series of exercises in political brinksmanship by the president, as he tries to bolster his negotiating position ahead of renewed talks for a Strategic Partnership Document with America that will determine the U.S. role in Afghanistan after 2014. Among the conditions that Karzai has set is an end to night raids by international troops and complete Afghan control over detainees. Although Karzai routinely plays to anti-American sentiment in Afghanistan by denouncing the U.S., he needs America's military and financial strength to back his weak government as it battles the Taliban insurgency. The CIA's infamous secret network of 'black site' interrogation centers is now gone, but suspected terrorists in Afghanistan are being held and interrogated for weeks at temporary sites, including one run by elite special operations forces at Bagram Air Base. The detainees include those suspected of top roles in the Taliban, al-Qaida or other militant groups. Karzai said holding Afghans inside the Bagram detention center breaches human rights . It remains unclear how many high-profile detainees are still being held at the U.S. detention center at Bagram Air Base north of Kabul . Also yesterday, Afghan police said they arrested two British private security contractors and two Afghan colleagues after finding a cache of weapons in their vehicle. They are being held for investigation into illegal arms transport. Karzai has ordered all the protection companies shut down by March and replaced by a unified government-run protection force, though recruitment is proceeding at a slow place. Karzai said the work to return citizens from Bagram, where a guard can here be seen standing by a cell, should do done within the next month (file picture) Authorities ordered the immediate shutdown of Afghanistan operations of their company, the international security consulting firm GardaWorld, and are questioning other company employees. In the latest violence, attackers gunned down a local government official on his way to a mosque in southern Afghanistan in another hit on a government figure. Hundreds of Afghan government officials have been killed in recent years as the Taliban pursue a sweeping assassination campaign seeking to weaken confidence Karzai's administration and discourage people from joining the government. Haji Fazel Mohammad was shot on his way to evening prayers Wednesday in the volatile district of Sangin in Helmand province, the governor's office said. The attackers escaped. The Taliban's assassination campaign has also hit senior figures. In September, a suicide attacker with a bomb in his turban killed former Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani, who led a government council seeking a political settlement with the insurgents. The assassin was posing as a Taliban peace emissary.",Afghan President says holding citizens at Bagram breaches their human rights .

People across the world watched in awe - and horror - as daredevil Felix Baumgartner became the first freefall diver to break the sound barrier after jumping from a balloon 24.5 miles above the Earth. 'Fearless Felix' reached speeds of up to 834 mph before his parachute opened and he landed back on solid ground five minutes later to have completed the highest and fastest skydive in history, one year ago yesterday. To celebrate the anniversary of the incredible feat, Red Bull has released a video showing multiple views of the jump all at once, including data that lends some perspective to just how fast Mr Baumgartner was plummeting towards our planet. Scroll down for video . To celebrate a year and a day since Felix Baumgartner reached speeds of up to 834 mph and completed the highest and fastest skydive in history, Red Bull has released a video showing multiple views of including data that lends some perspective to just how fast Mr Baumgartner was plummeting towards our planet . The video of the Red Bull Stratos jump contains data about the skydive including air speed, g-force, altitude and heart rate. Mr Baumgartner made his death-defying jump from a tiny capsule that took him up to the edge of space, which took him two-and-a-half hours to travel 128,177ft above the New Mexico desert - and less than ten minutes to land. He landed on his feet despite moments during the descent that had silenced his mission control as he appeared to lose control and plunge into a head-over-heels spin. People across the world watched in awe and horror as dare devil Felix Baumgartner became the first freefall diver to break the sound barrier after jumping from a balloon 24.5 miles above the Earth . The video of the RedBull Stratos jump, pictured, contains data about the skydive including air speed, g-force, altitude and heart rate . People who watched footage of the jump last year will remember how the daredevil fell to his knees and punched the air in triumph as the control room, packed with scientific experts and family including his teary-eyed mother, Eva, erupted into roars of applause. Speaking afterwards he said: 'Trust me, when you stand up there on top of the world, you become so humble. 'It's not about breaking records any more. It's not about getting scientific data. The only thing you want is to come back alive.' During the first part of Mr Baumgartner's free fall, anxious onlookers at the command centre held their breath as he appeared to spin uncontrollably. 'When I was spinning the first 10, 20 seconds, I never thought I was going to lose my life but I was disappointed because I'm going to lose my record. I put seven years of my life into this,' he said. Speaking after the jump Mr Baumgartner said: 'Trust me, when you stand up there on top of the world, you become so humble. It's not about breaking records any more. It's not about getting scientific data. The only thing you want is to come back alive' Mr Baumgartner said his Stratos jump has proved that a human can survive accelerating though the sound barrier in freefall and scientists gathered a lot of information, including the first-ever physiologic data from a peron freefalling at supersonic speeds that could be used to inform future projects . He added: 'In that situation, when you spin around, it's like hell and you don't know if you can get out of that spin or not. Of course it was terrifying. I was fighting all the way down because I knew that there must be a moment where I can handle it.' Red Bull, which sponsored the jump, has also made  a new documentary called RED BULL STRATOS - MISSION TO THE EDGE OF SPACE, to celebrate the anniversary, which is available here. Mr Baumgartner has revealed this week that he was inspired to do the challenge after watching Joe Kittinger's 19 mile high jump that took place in 1960. His idol is now Mr Baumgartner's mentor and friend and he told Red Bull: 'The fact that he [Mr Kittinger] survived opened the door to space . exploration, because it proved a pressure suit could protect a person in . that hostile environment.' Pilot Mr Baumgartner (pictured after his jump) said his next challenge is more personal in nature as he would like to pilot mountain rescue and help to fight wildfires by flying helicopters - completing his other childhood dream .

Questions: Senior minister Ken Clarke has been summoned to the Commons to answer questions about the Bilderberg Group, of which he is an elected member . Ken Clarke today dismissed conspiracy theories  about the secretive Bilderberg Group conference as 'absolute nonsense'. And in a thinly-veiled swipe at Commons Speaker John Bercow, he said he could not believe he had been dragged to the Commons to comment on an event held by a private organisation. The senior minister attended the Bilderberg meeting with David Cameron and George Osborne last week, but Downing Street has refused to give any information about who they met or what was discussed. Labour figures including Ed Balls and Lord Mandelson also attended. Today Mr Clarke was called to the Commons to explain what happened at the four-day conference, after Mr Cameron once promised to lead the 'most open and transparent government in the world'. Mr Bercow granted an urgent question from Labour MP Michael Meacher about the impact of the conference on government policy. But in a reference to the internet conspiracy theories, Mr Clarke joked that if Mr Meacher 'finds something deeply disturbing abut this, might I suggest he finds a different group of people to exchange tweets with'. Mr Clarke, minister without portfolio, is an elected member of the steering group which governs the the Bilderberg group. In a dismissive statement to MPs, he said it was the 'first occasion for me as I have never previously answered a question in the House of Commons about a private organisation for which the government has no responsibility'. He insisted that everyone who attended the conference did so as an individual and not representing any organisaton. 'We go there for the chance of having an off-the-record, informal discussion with the range of people you described, who are indeed distinguished but who are not remotely interested in getting together to decide anything. 'I always find it greatly adds to the depths of my understanding of what is being talked about and contemplated in parts of the States and Europe as well.' And in a direct swipe at Mr Meacher he added: 'With the greatest respect, . this is total, utter nonsense, and I would not normally regard you as . the sort of person who would be taken in by this sort of rubbish.' But Mr Meacher, an environment minister in Tony Blair's government, insisted there was something amiss. 'It is said by some, and indeed by you, that Bilderberg is a conspiracy - of course it's not a conspiracy. 'But at the same time 130 of the world's top decision-makers don't travel thousands of miles simply for a cosy chat. 'They have come here in order to concert their plans to deal with a particularly awkward stage in western capitalism and as such we, the public, are entitled to ask some questions and to hold them to account.' Refusal: David Cameron and George Osborne both attended the meeting in Watford last week but will not say who they met or what aspects of government policy were discussed . Cunning plan: American protestor and Radio DJ Alex Jones sailed a protest barge right through the security zone at the Bilderberg group meeting, which attracts controversy every year .

Mr Jones, who floated a barge along a canal near the conference at the weekend, appeared on BBC1's Sunday Politics to discuss the event.

Fema (Federal Emergency Management Agency) camps. ‘We . have an NDAA (National Defense Authorization Act) where they disappear . people now. You have this arrest for public safety, life in prison. It's . basically off with their heads, disappear them. Mr Cameron has made great play of his commitment to be more open about who he meets. In 2010 he promised: 'We want to be the most open and transparent government in the world.' Downing Street was forced to deny that Mr Cameron's decision to attend this evening ran counter to his pledge. The . spokesman added: 'The Prime Minister has always been clear about the . importance of transparency, which is why this Government has taken  a . number of steps in terms of publishing more data, more information and . making details of meetings available. 'We . publish far more information on meetings than previous governments. The .

Since its inception in 1954, Bilderberg  has held annual gatherings of 120-150 invited political leaders and experts from industry, finance, academia and the media, designed to 'foster dialogue between Europe and North America'. The group describes the conference as 'a forum for informal, off-the-record discussions about megatrends and the major issues facing the world' and states that the private nature of the meeting allows participants to 'listen, reflect and gather insights' without being bound by the conventions of office or by pre-agreed public positions.

One of the Army’s highest-ranking female officers is facing jail after she admitted fiddling her military allowances. Lieutenant Colonel Angela Knock, whose nursing skills helped save hundreds of soldiers’ lives on the frontline in Afghanistan, is being court martialled after she pocketed thousands of pounds. The 49-year-old commander’s spectacular fall from grace came after she led a team of highly-skilled medics at the operating theatre of the trauma hospital at Camp Bastion. Dedicated: Angela Knock, left, helps a surgeon operate on a wounded British soldier in Helmand . Mother-of-three Knock, a member of the Territorial Army’s 212 (Yorkshire) Field Hospital, dealt with thousands of severely wounded casualties during her warzone deployment. The reservist worked under extreme pressure to treat harrowing injuries, including young soldiers with arms and legs blown off by roadside bombs. Knock, who also works as a theatre nurse at Sheffield’s Royal Hallamshire Hospital, pleaded guilty last month to ten counts of false accounting and forgery. The charges are understood to involve sums of about £8,000 she fraudulently claimed for gardening services at her home between 2009 and 2011. She admitted the charges during a hearing at Catterick Military Court Centre in North Yorkshire. She is due to be sentenced in the autumn and faces military detention. She could also be stripped of her rank and thrown out of the military. Knock, a widow, was a highly-regarded officer with the Royal Army Medical Corps. She is thought to have served as a ‘weekend warrior’ for 20 years while following her civilian career as a nurse. She has served two tours of duty in Iraq and three in Afghanistan. Trauma: Nurse Major Angela Knock, right, faces jail and could be stripped of her rank and thrown out of the military . In 2011 she was deployed to work at the Role 3 Hospital in Camp Bastion, Britain’s main base in the Taliban heartland of Helmand province. She ran the operating theatre at the facility, widely acknowledged as the best in the world. Some 98 per cent of patients survive their injuries. The team of about 250 had to treat soldiers, civilians and even Taliban fighters – often several at a time – who had been badly injured by improvised explosive devices or in firefights. In an interview during her stint on the frontline, Knock, from Chapeltown, Sheffield, described the unique challenges of working at Camp Bastion. ‘A lot of the guys who come in, such as the triple amputees who suffer severe blood loss, would never have made it to hospital in Britain,’ she said. ‘They survive because of the speed of care from their colleagues and medics in the field, and the fact that when they arrive here, there are four or five surgeons in the emergency department waiting to start work. That doesn’t happen anywhere else.’ Fall from grace: Ms Knock, who lives in Chapeltown, South Yorkshire (pictured), has admitted ten counts of forgery and false accounting . More than a dozen people a day required operations during 212 (Yorkshire) Field Hospital’s deployment. One of the busiest days saw four critical cases, including a double amputee, triple amputee and an insurgent with shrapnel wounds who died on the operating table. Her team also battled against the odds to save a three-year-old Afghan girl who suffered catastrophic injuries in a Taliban bomb blast. Knock – whose sons are James, 22, Matthew, 20, and William, 18 –  said: ‘We deal predominantly with young men, some the same age as my sons. One of the worst was a triple amputee, whose pelvis had been disturbed, potentially damaging internal organs. We managed to stabilise him and he was flown back to the UK.’ Battle: Angela Knock served in Afghanistan where she frequently treated harrowing injuries . She also put her specialist skills to good use in 2010 carrying out life-changing surgery when Haiti was devastated by an earthquake. Knock worked with aid charity Merlin as part of an expert plastic surgery reconstruction team operating on victims. She told a local newspaper: ‘I’ve never been to a disaster zone before, but I cannot imagine any healthcare worker who would not love to be able to use their skills to help people who desperately need it.’ She said of the procedures, carried out in a makeshift operating theatre within an old tennis club: ‘Without skin grafting some of the wounds would have broken down, which would have led to infections and amputations. ‘By getting the skin covering them, although they will have another two weeks of dressings, they should be able to get back on with their normal lives.’","Angela Knock, 49, from Sheffield, admits forgery and false accounting .

Meshael Alayban, who is married to the grandson of the King of Saudi Arabia, appeared in an Orange County court in the morning dressed in a blue jumpsuit and answered the judge from behind grilled bars. Uttering 'yes, your honor' several times during her time in the Santa Ana courtroom, Alayban, 42, was aided by an Arabic-speaking interpreter during the proceedings. Alayban, 42, faces one felony count of human trafficking charges and up to 12 years in prison - she has not entered a plea yet - her arraignment is on July 29th. Behind Bars: Saudi princess Meshael Alayban, (right), listens to an interpreter during her scheduled appearance in court Thursday July 11th, 2013 in Santa Ana, California today . As part of the conditions of her mammoth bail, Alayban will have to wear a GPS tracking device and is not allowed to leave Orange County without the courts express permission. She is also not allowed to try and contact the alleged victim, a 30-year-old Kenyan woman who alleges that she was held captive as a domestic slave by the princess and forced to work 16-hours a day, seven days a week for only $220 a month. The Kenyan woman, who is now being held in a shelter, claims she escaped from the Santa Ana property where she worked for Alayban and boarded a bus where she explained her plight to a passenger who helped her phone police. Steve Baric, the attorney for the victim who has been identified as Jane Doe, said that he was 'gravely concerned' for his clients safety according to the LA Times.

Alayban is married to Abdulrahman bin Nasser bin Abdulaziz al Saud, who is the grandson of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. In addition to the Kenyan woman, police said that when officers executed a search warrant for Alayban's home, they discovered four women from the Philippines also working in similar circumstances. All five of the women's passports had been confiscated and placed in a bank safe deposit box which they allegedly did not have access to. Farrah Emami, of the Orange County District Attorney's Office confirmed to MailOnline that Abdulaziz al Saud was in the United States on Tuesday when his wife was arrested. They added that Alayban was arrested due to their belief a criminal case could be persued against her.

However, they added that the investigation into the four other women was ongoing 'to see if criminal charges are appropriate to any other individuals.' Emami said that she believes that al Saud is still in the United States. Meshael Alayban, 42, faces human trafficking charges and up to 12 years in prison after she allegedly held a 30-year-old Kenyan at her Orange County, California home after taking her passport from her. Alayban was arrested after the Kenyan woman carrying a suitcase flagged down a bus after escaping and tearfully told a passenger that she was a human trafficking victim. The passenger helped the lady contact police who traveled to Alayban's home where they found another four servants from the Philippines allegedly in similar conditions after serving a search warrant on the condo where the princess, her husband and her family lived. The 30-year-old woman was hired through an agency in Kenya in March 2012 and her passport was allegedly taken from her on arrival in Saudi Arabia by Alayban. Police say Alayban's family traveled to the United States in May with the victim and four women from the Philippines. Seriousness: Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas speaks at an informal news conference after a hearing at the Santa Ana Courthouse in Santa Ana, California today after Meshael Alayban was charged . It is thought that the Saudi Arabian consulate in Los Angeles may have posted the $5 million bail and Alayban has been ordered to wear a GPS tracking device as she is considered a flight risk. 'This is not a contract dispute,' Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas told the court during a bail hearing on Wednesday afternoon. 'This is holding someone captive against their will.' Alayban's attorney, Paul Meyer, said the case was a contractual dispute and argued his client shouldn't be assigned a ransom-like bail solely because she was rich. He said she had been traveling to the United States since she was a child, owned properties here and had given her word she would address the allegations. 'This is a domestic work hours dispute,' he said. Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas, (left), watches as Irvine Police Chief David Maggard speaks after a hearing at the Santa Ana Courthouse in Santa Ana, California, today . Rackauckas had originally asked the judge to deny bail for Alayban or set it at $20 million, saying it was unlikely any amount would guarantee a Saudi princess would show up in court. The victim was working 'around the clock' for the family cooking, cleaning and caring for children, said Irvine police chief David Maggard Jr. She had been promised wages of $1,600 a month but was paid only about $220 a month, Rackauckas said. The victims alleges that instead of her contracted work eight hours a day, five days a week, she instead was putting in 16 hour shifts, seven days a week on every conceivable household chore. The Kenyan lady also said that she was working abroad to pay for her seven-year-old daughter's medical bills. Alayban allegedly only gave the passports to the five women at passport control and has had them under lock and key in a bank safe box since they arrived in the United States in May. Arrest: Police in Orange County arrested Meshael Alayban at this condo in Irvine - where she has been staying with her family since May of this year . Investigations into each of the victims' circumstances are ongoing. All five women are said to be in good health. No indications of physical abuse were found and were being assisted with finding housing at a shelter. The other four women left the home voluntarily with police once authorities arrived. They told police they were interested in being free, Maggard said. No charges have been filed yet in connection with their circumstances.

'The laws of our nation and California do not tolerate people who . deprive or violate the liberty of another and obtain forced labor or . services,' District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said in the statement. 'If . any person is being enslaved, he or she should contact law enforcement.

One of the ‘moles’ Prince Charles is alleged to have placed in Government was seconded to the Cabinet Office and worked as private secretary to a minister close to David Cameron. It was reported yesterday that 30-year-old Laura Osbaldeston was a senior research officer at Clarence House before she moved to the Cabinet Office on a two-year secondment. During her time there, she was promoted to the role of private secretary to Nick Hurd, the Minister for Civil Society. Laura Osbaldeston was reportedly a senior research officer at Prince Charles' residence Clarence House before moving to the Cabinet Office where she was promoted to role of private secretary to Nick Hurd (left) Three members of the Prince of Wales’s staff have taken secondments at either the Cabinet Office or the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs over the last five years. MPs have accused the Prince of planting ‘moles’ in Government departments and have claimed that they were there to advance his private interests. This latest revelation sparked further claims that the Prince of Wales was meddling in Government and abandoning the tradition of royal neutrality in politics – with Labour MP Paul Flynn describing him as a ‘constitutional crisis in waiting’. Neither Clarence House nor the Cabinet Office would confirm that Miss Osbaldeston, a Cambridge graduate, was the employee who had moved between them. Miss Osbaldeston’s LinkedIn page says she started work as a research assistant in a ‘private household’ in 2007 before being made senior research officer. While she was there, she took part in . several Clarence House charity events and was one of a group of . ‘Charlie’s angels’ who did a 26-mile walk for cancer charities in 2009 . and raised £17,538. She then joined the Cabinet Office in 2011 on a two-year secondment, and progressed to the role of private secretary to Mr Hurd. She has now returned to Clarence House. Prince Charles, pictured with David Cameron, has faced accusations of meddling with Government . A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said last night: ‘The idea that there was a mole or a spy is complete nonsense. They were a junior member of staff on secondment.’ Labour MP Paul Flynn said Prince Charles was a 'constitutional crisis in waiting' A spokeswoman for Clarence House said the three secondees were junior members of staff, aged in their 20s, who would not have come into contact with the Prince very often. She pointed out that the staff made their own requests for experience in government departments for their own professional development reasons. ‘We have had two secondments to government departments in the past two years,’ she said. ‘The secondments were suggested on the basis of professional development and the paperwork was arranged by the relevant HR departments. ‘One secondment was one year and the other was for two years. Both have come to a natural conclusion. There was no official feedback mechanism and no regular meetings were attended with the Prince of Wales’s household. ‘The secondments were on a like-for-like basis. One secondee has now left Clarence House and the other is due to return shortly after a sabbatical. ‘Over the past five years, in addition to the two secondments already discussed, there has been one other secondment, for six weeks to the Cabinet Office. We have no new secondments planned at present.’ The revelations come a week after the Mail disclosed that the Prince of Wales has had 36 private audiences with Cabinet ministers since the election - one a month. Alongside seven meetings with the Prime Minister, he also met a disproportionately high number of ministers from departments representing issues of personal interest to him, including the environment, alternative medicine and town planning. It raised questions over whether the Prince was lobbying for his pet issues. But Clarence House robustly defended the summits, saying it was his right and duty to meet any minister ‘he chooses’. They also said some meetings were requested by the ministers rather than the Prince.","Laura Osbaldeston reportedly moved from Clarence House to Cabinet Office .

Casey Anthony's outspoken lawyer has questioned the role of her father in the apparent drowning death of his granddaughter five years ago. More than two years on from Casey's controversial murder acquittal following two-year-old Caylee's death, Jose Baez has cast aspersions on why the police never fully investigated George Anthony. Mr Baez's insinuations in the new foreword of his book Presumed Guilty coincide with the publication of the paperback version and revolve around George telling Casey that 'he'd take care of it'. Scroll down for video . New paperback: Criminal defence attorney Jose Baez signs copies of his book 'Presumed Guilty: Casey Anthony: The Inside Story at Books and Books in July 2012 in Coral Gables, Florida - at his new offices . Loose ends: George Anthony reacts as he waits for the jury's verdict to be read in the murder case against his daughter Casey Anthony in the courtroom at the Orange County Courthouse in Orlando, Florida, in July 2011 . Not guilty: Casey Anthony listens to the testimony of Krystal Holloway, who claims to have had an affair with Anthony's father, during her murder trial at the Orange County Courthouse in June 2011 in Orlando, Florida . This statement was in reference to . how George held Caylee's lifeless body in his arms following her . drowning and how Caylee's body came to be found. The . book's paperback version will reach stores on Tuesday - and in the . foreword, Mr Baez recounts a lunch he had with his opposite number . during the trial, lead prosecutor, Linda Drane Burdick. 'Regardless . of what happened, whoever threw Caylee into those woods like that . deserves to rot in hell,' Ms Burdick told Mr Baez, according to the Orlando Sentinel. 'You don't do that to a baby.' Mr . Baez writes: 'I agreed. This fact disturbs me greatly. It's the one . fact that will never change. You don't do that to a baby. Whoever put . Caylee there, I curse you.' In fact, Mr Baez writes that the entire issue of who dumped the baby in the woods is the 'one loose end that really haunts me'. Turning . his attention to George, Mr Baez does repeat and stand by the claim . made by the defence that Caylee drowned in the family swimming pool and . that Casey and her father conspired to cover up the tragedy. Tragic case: The death of two-year-old Caylee Anthony in 2008 in Florida prompted a huge murder trial . Scene: Mr Baez writes that the entire issue of who dumped the baby in the woods is the 'one loose end that really haunts me' Adversary: Assistant state attorney Linda Drane Burdick presents the final portion of rebuttal in Casey Anthony's murder trial at the Orange County Courthouse in Orlando, Florida, in July 2011 . Mr Baez writes: 'According to Casey, George held Caylee's lifeless body in his arms and, after accusing Casey of being responsible for her death, told Casey he'd 'take care of it.' 'Caylee's body was discovered dumped in the woods. That was all I was ever able to uncover about how Caylee ended up where she did.' Mr Baez also criticises the police for never investigating George Anthony and dismisses out of hand the notorious report from WKMG-Channel 6's Tony Pipitone that an internet search was conducted on the Anthony computer for 'foolproof suffocation'. He also turns his attentions to Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. 'compromised' the jurors' safety by releasing their names to the public in the aftermath of the verdict. Incredibly, Mr Baez also berates the public for 'having no interest in hearing Casey's side of this sordid story.' Released: Casey Anthony (right) and her lawyer Jose Baez (left) leave the Orange County Jail in Orlando on the day Anthony was released in July 2011 . Explaining that he took the case because he believe she was innocent, Baez adds that he developed an attachment to Casey Anthony and felt a responsibility towards her. Never shy, Mr Baez also relates in his new foreword how he cried when he learned that the hardback copy of the book had become a New York Times bestseller - as he tells his readers he is doing well now in 'his dream office' in Coral Gables, Florida, while mainting his Orlando office. 'If ever you need a robust defense, you know where to find me,' Baez writes. In June the Florida judge who presided over Casey Anthony's murder trial says he was shocked by the jury's 'not guilty' verdict because there was 'sufficient evidence' that she killed her two-year-old daughter, Caylee. Judge Belvin Perry made the extraordinary admission in his first interview since the close of Anthony's trial nearly two years ago. 'There were two sides to Casey Anthony,' Judge Perry told NBC's Today Show. 'There was the side that was before the jury, where she portrayed the role of a mother who had lost a child - someone who was wrongfully accused. 'And then you could notice the change and transformation in her when the jury went out. 'Shocked:' The Florida judge who presided over Casey Anthony's murder trial, Belvin Perry, says he was shocked by the jury's 'not guilty' verdict . First interview: Judge Perry (right) made the extraordinary admission in an interview with NBC's Savannah Guthrie (left) Watch the full interview in NBC's TODAY Show here . 'She was very commanding, she took charge of different things, and you could see her sometimes scolding her attorneys.' Judge Perry said he believes the jury let the young mother off the hook for . first-degree murder because she was 'very manipulative' and had an . extraordinarily personable lawyer. The jury handed down its 'not guilty' verdict in July of 2011. At the moment that he read the verdict from the . jury, Judge Perry described feeling 'surprise,' 'shock' and 'disbelief.' 'Wrong' verdict: Judge Perry said 'There was sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict of murder in the first degree in this case' He said he had to read the verdict twice in his head to make sure he had read it correctly. Judge Perry was surprised because he believed 'there was sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict of murder in the first degree in this case,' he said. He also felt that prosecutors had 'proved a great case.' 'But you’ve got to realize this was a circumstantial evidence case,' he added. 'All the defense had to do was create that reasonable doubt, and that’s what they did.' Mr Baez, played a large role in swaying the jury's opinion of her innocence, Judge Perry said. 'The state had better lawyers, but Mr Baez was very personable,' he said. 'He came across as someone that you would like. 'It’s like someone trying to sell a used car. Who are you going to buy it from? The most likeable salesperson.' Casey wasn't quite as personable as her lawyer, but she could put on a good front before the jury, Judge Perry said. 'There was always two sides to Casey,' he said. There was the public persona that she wanted the jury to see and there was that side that she showed when the jury was not there.' He specifically recalled a day when Casey fought . with her lawyers over a suggestion that she take a plea deal for . aggravated manslaughter instead of first-degree murder. Shocking admission: Perry says the jury found Anthony not guilty because she was 'very manipulative' and had an extraordinarily personable lawyer . 'Car salesman:' Judge Perry compared Mr Baez (pictured) to a used car salesman as he described how the lawyer persuaded the jury into thinking Anthony was innocent . 'I will never forget that day,' he said, noting that he was in earshot of the conversation while she was in a holding cell. 'All of a sudden, you heard shouting coming from the holding cell, some four-letter words coming from the holding cell, and she was quite upset,' he said. 'So upset that one counselor suggested that she was incompetent to proceed.' Casey's trial was televised and made into a spectacle as one of the most sensational stories of the year, sparking protests, drawing huge crowds to the courtroom and attracting international news coverage. 'I had no earthly idea that it would . command the attention that it did worldwide,' Judge Perry said. 'It was truly a . fantastic experience.' He said he didn't think that the . cameras in the courtroom - which are permitted by Florida state law - . had affected the outcome of her trial. 'In Florida we've always had cameras and I think people need to know how their justice system works,' he said. Emotional: Casey Anthony tries to collect herself during a break in her murder trial in Orlando, Florida. Judge Perry says there was 'sufficient evidence' to prove that she was guilty of killing her daughter . The jury found Casey guilty of four misdemeanor counts of providing false information to a law enforcement officer. She was released from jail on July 17, 2011. In January of this year, a Florida appeals court reduced her convictions from four to two counts. Asked whether justice has been served in Casey's case, Judge Perry said that remains to be determined. 'Well justice has been served in the sense that the jury has spoken,' he said. 'But justice will finally be served one day by the judge of judges. And she will have to live with this and deal with this for the rest of her life.'","Jose Baez asks why Caylee Anthony was found in woods in Florida .

Prince Charles has today spoken of his sorrow at the 'brutal' execution of Drummer Lee Rigby and admitted it has affected the morale of the armed forces. The future king said the Woolwich killing of the Fusilier on May 22 has taken its 'toll' on troops, but proved their ability to overcome adversity. Lee Rigby, 25, a father-of-one and the 2nd Battalion Royal . Regiment of Fusiliers, was run down by a car and then hacked to death as he returned to his barracks. Upsetting: The Prince of Wales has today spoken of how the 'brutal' death of Fusilier Lee Rigby, who was hacked to death in the street in Woolwich in May, has taken its toll on troops' morale . The Prince of Wales said he was shocked by the act, and said he understood the worry of families whose loved-ones are in the forces, as his son Harry has actively served around the world. He made the comments to mark the launch of The Sun newspaper's annual Military Awards. 'The challenges our Armed Forces face are not confined to physical and psychological injuries sustained on the battlefield,' he said writing in the newspaper. Understanding: Prince Charles said he knew the anxiety felt by families well, as his son Harry has also served abroad, pictured at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan last year . 'The effect on morale of long and enduring campaigns that separate troops from their loved ones again and again, of redundancy programmes that are reshaping our Armed Forces and even the threat to our off-duty troops in the perceived sanctity of their homeland - as seen with the brutal death of Fusilier Rigby - all take their toll. 'Over the last few years, every soldier, sailor, airman and woman has demonstrated beyond all doubt they can stand firm against any adversity.' Drummer Rigby's horrific killing led to nationwide shock and revulsion and led to an outpouring of support for his family from the public. The Prince said he is 'convinced' that the public all have a role to play in helping 'those who have suffered as a result of their service', ranging from donations and fundraising through to visual support such as t-shirts and car stickers. Talking about the risks that every armed force member face, he said: 'I know very well how much worry this danger creates for families and loved one, as my own son Harry served in Afghanistan over the winter.' Charles, who himself served in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, added that the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan will continue to be a 'very tricky operation' and that troops remain 'exposed to every conceivable danger'. In court: Royal Barnes, from Hackney, is accused of creating clips about the father-of-one's death, whose funeral was held in Bury, Lancashire, in July . A 22-year-old man from East London has been charged with terror offences after allegedly making a series of video recordings about the murder of soldier Lee Rigby. Royal Barnes, from Hackney, is accused of creating clips about the father-of-one's death, publishing a statement entitled 'Muslim laughs at British Soldier killing', and inciting terrorism overseas. He is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court after being arrested on Friday along with a 21-year-old woman, who is due to answer bail on Tuesday. A Scotland Yard spokesman said Barnes is charged with dissemination of terrorist publications for allegedly making a series of recordings about Fusilier Rigby's death on May 22, and circulating them ""with the intention, either directly or indirectly of encouraging others into the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism"". He is also charged with encouraging an act of terrorism by publishing a statement that glorified the killing, and inciting terrorism overseas. It is claimed that on June 12 he 'incited another to commit an act of terrorism, wholly or partly outside the United Kingdom, and that act, would if committed in England and Wales constitute an offence'.","Prince said Woolwich killing proved troops' 'ability to overcome adversity'

Early intervention: A study found people in Britain do not seek help for early symptoms of cancer because they are embarrassed or reluctant to waste their doctors' time . Having a ‘stiff upper lip’ could mean some Britons are dying needlessly from cancer, warn researchers. A study found that many people in Britain do not seek help for the early symptoms of cancer because they are embarrassed or reluctant to waste their doctors’ time. Experts say this British stoicism may help explain differences in cancer survival between the UK and other high-income countries. Britons also have less awareness of cancer risk increasing with age, meaning sufferers are less likely to be treated at an early stage when there is more chance of a cure. The UK is joint bottom with Denmark of the international table for rates of survival, despite all six of the countries surveyed having similarly good access to healthcare. There were 157,000 deaths from cancer in the UK in 2010, with more than three quarters occurring in those aged 65 and over. Scientists from the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership previously found that for lung, breast, bowel and ovarian cancers diagnosed between 1995 and 2007, Australia, Canada, Sweden and Norway had the best survival rates. Denmark and the UK had the lowest, despite all the countries having similarly good cancer registration systems and access to healthcare. One year survival for people with lung cancer was 30 per cent in the UK, compared with 44 per cent in Sweden. The latest study, conducted by Cancer Research UK and Ipsos Mori, surveyed 19,079 people aged 50 and older in six countries to see if cultural factors could explain the differences. It found little difference in people’s views about the chances of surviving the disease or awareness of symptoms. But when the study, published in the British Journal of Cancer, looked at barriers to seeing the doctor with early symptoms, our stiff upper lip came to the fore. Worrying about wasting a doctor’s time was a concern for 34 per cent of those in the UK, compared with only 9 per cent of Swedes. And embarrassment about seeing the doctor with a potentially serious symptom was most common in Britain (15 per cent) and least common in Denmark (6 per cent). Awareness of the link between cancer and age was lowest in Canada (13 per cent) and the UK (14 per cent) but highest in Sweden (38 per cent). Reluctant: Experts say British stoicism may help explain differences in cancer survival between the UK and other high-income countries . Dr Lindsay Forbes, a study leader from King’s College London, said the UK was making its mark for the wrong reasons. She added: ‘A high proportion of people said that not wanting to waste the doctor’s time and embarrassment might stop them going to the doctor with a symptom that might be serious. ‘The traditional British stiff upper lip could be preventing people from seeing their doctor. ‘We need to support people to make the right decisions about their health.’ A top cancer charity has been warned about sending out thousands of 'threatening' letters designed to raise funds. The Advertising Standards Authority has banned Cancer Research UK from using the tactic, which people felt put them under unnecessary pressure to make a donation. The charity circular was delivered to homes in a plain brown envelope with 'It doesn't matter to me who you are' in place of the address. A letter inside included a series of alarming statements about cancer and the devastation it can cause, including: 'I'm still tearing lives apart. Every two minutes I take hold of another person.' It added: 'Don't donate to Cancer Research UK. I'm sure you have better things to spend your money on than trying to beat me.' The ASA said the letter was 'likely to be received as a threatening message'.","Study suggests Britons are embarrassed or reluctant to waste doctors' time .

'Had everything to live for': Sixteen-year-old Charlie Booth (pictured) killed himself with a shotgun he was given as a birthday present, an inquest heard . A schoolboy blasted himself in the head with a shotgun he was given as a 15th birthday present, an inquest heard. Charlie Booth, 16, was worried he would get into trouble after police visited to discuss sexual text messages he sent to a girl. He was described as a remarkable young man by his headteacher at the prestigious £10,000-a-year Gad's Hill School in Higham, Kent, set in the former home of Charles Dickens. Charlie was found dead by his parents on March 8 at their home in Cobham, Kent. The coroner ruled that Charlie took his own life. Hours before his death, police were called to the family’s home between 6pm and 7pm to reports of text messages of a sexual nature being sent to a girl, the inquest at Gravesend’s Old Town Hall heard yesterday. Det Sgt Lee Neiles, of Kent Police, told the inquest: 'She wanted them to stop. 'Nick (Charlie’s father) gave him words of advice and they went to KFC in Valley Drive in Gravesend and Nick said he (Charlie) had to be careful about contacting young girls. 'They had a KFC but Charlie seemed withdrawn.' They returned home and Charlie went to his bedroom. Around 10pm his mother Julia came back from an evening with her friends in Bluewater to hear about the complaints made against Charlie. She told her son off and confiscated his mobile phone. Around 30 minutes later, while Mr and Mrs Booth were downstairs, they heard a loud bang. Det Sgt Neiles said: 'They went to his bedroom and Julia saw a light coming from the spare room and found him on the floor in the corridor. 'She said she saw him on his side and he was clearly dead.' Heard a loud bang: Charlie was found dead by his parents on March 8 at their home (above) in Cobham, Kent . Active: Charlie was a member of Gad's Combined Cadet Forces (CCF) Kent Police and South East Coast Ambulance were called at 10.32pm and Charlie was pronounced dead at the scene. Det Sgt Neiles told the court Charlie shot himself with the intention to commit suicide. He said: 'This is on the basis Charlie had a shotgun and knew the power it possessed and Charlie was extremely worried about getting into trouble regarding the text messages. 'The note in his jogging bottoms appears to be a suicide note.' Paying tribute to Charlie, Det Sgt Neiles said: 'Charlie was a popular boy who enjoyed playing rugby and hockey. 'He was due to go on a trip [to Alaska in July] and had raised £3,000 by organising quiz nights and working. 'He had been accepted into King’s Rochester. He had everything to live for.' Shooting champion Charlie received a gun as a present for his 15th birthday and was a member of Gad’s Combined Cadet Forces (CCF), which trains pupils in a range of military activities including shooting, survival training, rock climbing and taking part in assault courses. Det Sgt Neiles said: 'Everybody chipped into to buy him the gun and he was over the moon. Active: Charlie was a member of the school's Combined Cadet Force, which trains pupils in a range of military activities including shooting, survival training, rock climbing and taking part in assault courses . 'He was a totally responsible and was trusted by people to handle a gun. 'He used to go out shooting with his dad. He was a typical country boy. He never drank, apart from the occasional cider with his dad.' Passing verdict, North Kent Coroner Roger Hatch said: 'I have no alternative to record other than Charlie Booth took his own life. I express my sympathies to the family.' A tribute issued by his father Nick, 52, . mother Julia, 48, and sister Harriet, 12, at the time of his death said: .

'Charlie was one in a million, very popular and well-liked, and was quite simply our beautiful boy.' Gad’s Hill headmaster David Craggs added: 'Charlie was a remarkable young man, who had such a bright future ahead of him. 'Charlie was a friendly, enthusiastic, mature and self-confident student with so much to live for - attributes that make this tragedy even more difficult to comprehend.

Charged again: Byron Smith had his charge increased from second degree murder to first-degree after killing two teenagers . A Minnesota man accused of killing two unarmed teenagers- shooting them multiple times as they tried to break into his home- has been indicted on first-degree murder charges. A Morrison County grand jury indicted Byron Smith, 64, on Wednesday on two counts of first-degree murder with premeditation in the November 22 deaths of 17-year-old Nick Brady and 18-year-old Haile Kifer. Initially, Smith was charged with two counts of second-degree murder but the new charges, issued under seal Wednesday, were announced after a Thursday court appearance. In order to bring someone to trial for first-degree murder in Minnesota, a grand jury indictment must be issued. If convicted, Smith faces a mandatory penalty of life in prison without parole. 'We look forward to proving this case ... and bringing justice to these two high school students whose lives were so violently and prematurely ended,' Washington County Attorney Pete Orput said in a statement. One of Smith's attorneys, Adam Johnson, said Smith was acting in self-defense and was defending his dwelling, in rural Little Falls. Under Minnesota law, a person may use deadly force to prevent a felony from taking place in one's home or dwelling. According to a criminal complaint, Smith, a retired U.S. State Department employee, told authorities he feared the teens had a weapon when they entered his home on Thanksgiving Day and acknowledged firing 'more shots than I needed to.' Killed: The bodies of cousins Haile Kifer, 18, (left) and Nicholas Brady, 17, (right) were found stashed in the basement of a man who claimed the teenagers had broken into his home on Thanksgiving . Scene: Smith's home in Little Falls, MN has been burglarized eight times in recent years, his brother said . He also told investigators he fired 'a . good clean finishing shot' into Kifer's head as she was gasping for . air, the complaint said. Prosecutors have said an audio . recording Smith made of the shootings includes him telling a wounded . Kifer 'you're dying,' before firing the final shot. Court documents show his security system also made a video recording of the teens breaking in. Authorities weren't notified of the . killings until the following day when Smith asked a neighbor for a good . lawyer and later asked the neighbor to call police. When police showed up, the criminal complaint said, Smith told the officers of the break-in and shooting and was arrested. Defense attorneys have said Smith's property had been burglarized before and that he was scared. Missed: Friends and teacher expressed their shock at deaths and described Haile as a popular role model . Joker: Friends also remembered Brady as an out-going student who loved to make people smile . Court documents show Brady was involved in at least two of the prior burglaries at Smith's property. Brady and Kifer, who were cousins, . also have been linked to another burglary that happened the day before . they were killed. In that case, six bottles of prescription drugs were . stolen and found in a car linked to them. The case stirred up strong emotions in Little Falls, a central Minnesota town of about 8,000 people. Some believed Smith went too far by . repeatedly shooting the unarmed teens, but others said he was within his . rights to protect his home. During Thursday's court appearance, . prosecutor Orput asked that Smith's bail be set at $2million, given the . nature of the offense. Judge Doug Anderson denied that request, and kept . bail at $50,000, with conditions. Orput said he'll ask to have the lesser second-degree charges against Smith dismissed as the case goes forward.","Bodies of Haile Kifer, 18, and Nick Brady Schaeffel, 17, found day after they were shot during break-in .

"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 08:13 EST, 18 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:11 EST, 18 March 2013 . A failing school that has been put into special measures by Ofsted has banned pupils from wearing Ugg boots, coloured laces or fizzy drinks into class. School chiefs at Addington High in Croydon, south London, decided on the clampdown in a bid to 'improve standards' at the 1,200-pupil school. According to the new diktat, pupils caught wearing the slouchy boots or the 'incorrect uniform' will be given three choices - to go home and change, wear items from the school's 'lost property' box or spend the day in 'isolation'. Addington High School has imposed the crackdown in an attempt to raise the school's low standards . Fizzy drinks, like Lucozade, and Ugg boots have been banned from the school, which was told by inspectors to dramatically improve . The school has banned all fizzy drinks in a bid to make students 'less hyper', does not sell the sweet drinks on its premises and has outlawed mobile phones, hoodies and baseball hats too. Bosses at the school have also told pupils and parents that they have to remove their coats when inside the school and that they can only wear black jumpers or fleeces. The school's website, relating to shoes, states: 'No UGG style boots, no coloured logos or patterns, no coloured laces, no socks over trousers.' It adds: 'Students should not wear a hoodie to school (we will confiscate all hoodies and all non-black jumpers at the start of the day). 'School fleeces are available to buy from reception and plain black jumpers can be purchased in most high street stores. 'Students should wear black shoes or plain black trainers Students who do not comply with this will be provided with black plimsolls to wear until they have the correct footwear. The school's website demands that the pupils remove any brightly coloured laces, and they are banned from wearing socks over trousers . Laying down the law: The Croydon school's long list of rules will hopefully raise standards . 'Students should NOT wear outdoor clothes (coats, hats and scarves) inside the school building. 'Baseball caps are not school uniform. They will be confiscated. 'Fizzy drinks should not be brought onto the school site. These will be removed from students. 'Students with incorrect items of school uniform will not be able to attend normal lessons and will be offered three choices; They can go home to change, they can (if possible) borrow appropriate items from school or they can spend the day in isolation.' One parent, who asked not to be named, said: 'I can see the rules on hoodies and mobile phones are sensible, but telling pupils they can't wear a blue or green jumper is just a bit silly. 'The school doesn't have a strict uniform code, so it's not like Eton or something, so they are just making a rod for their own back as they will have to sent home children all day to put on a black jumper.' The crackdown came after a scathing Ofsted report, which in June last year rated Addington High 'inadequate', before placing it in special measures - this is when inspectors find that a school is not providing an acceptable standard of education and its leaders are not good enough to help it to improve. It means inspectors make visits every term to the school until it is deemed to have improved to an acceptable standard. One parent, who asked not to be named, said: 'I can see the rules on hoodies and mobile phones are sensible, but telling pupils they can't wear a blue or green jumper is just a bit silly. Ofsted Inspector Christine Raeside wrote to the school in January saying that she remained unconvinced that the school was doing enough to improve its standards. She wrote: 'Having considered all the evidence I am of the opinion that at this time the school is not making enough progress towards the removal of special measures.' She suggested a string of areas that the school needs to improve upon, including tracking and analyising the performance and experience of different groups, and making staff accountable for improving behaviour. Acting head teacher James Malley said in a letter to parents: 'My team will deal with those students who do not respond to the clear guidance we provide for them.' 'At the time of the Ofsted inspection in July, behaviour at the school was rated inadequate. It is my pledge to improve behaviour at Addington so learning can flourish.' Addington High were unavailable to comment when the Mail Online contacted them.","Addington High in Croydon cracks down on colourful laces and fizzy drinks .

"By . Lydia Warren . PUBLISHED: . 09:25 EST, 6 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:48 EST, 6 May 2013 . Victim: Lee David Clayworth said his teaching career is ruined after online harassment from an ex . A Canadian teacher has claimed that his career has been ruined because his ex-girlfriend refuses to stop posting naked pictures of him online and calling him a pedophile. Lee David Clayworth, 35, from Vancouver, has been relentlessly cyber-stalked and harassed by Lee Ching Yan, whom he dated for several months while working as a teacher in Malaysia in 2010, he said. He claims that after ending the relationship with Yan, she broke into his apartment, stole his laptop and uploaded naked pictures of him - which she had previously taken - to 'cheater' websites. He has been applying for jobs since January and has received no positive responses - and he is certain it is because of the online posts and pictures. Despite winning a defamation case against Yan, many of the sites are still active. They show pictures of a nude Clayworth beneath headings including 'child lover' and 'pedophile'. 'Would you want this man to teach your children?' another reads. Yan also allegedly hacked into his email account . and, posing as Clayworth, sent messages to his contacts 'revealing' how he had sex with underage students, CBC News reported. The . harassment has been relentless - with her posting hundreds of comments . on social networks such as Facebook, accusing him of vile, criminal . acts, and claiming that he cheated on her. 'I did a Google search of my name and I . saw profiles listed saying I am a psychopath, I am a child molester, a . pedophile, I am involved with my students and so on,' he told CBC. Harasser: He successfully sued his ex-girlfriend, Lee Ching Yan, for defamation but the posts remain online . Clayworth, who returned to Vancouver in January after his contract with the Malaysian school ended, said the treatment - and his struggle to remove posts from the web - has left him unable to get a job. 'I feel not only shut out of my own profession - but any job I apply for,' he said. 'It's a very, very dark place to be... and I am powerless.' He believed there was some hope when a judge in Malaysia found Yan guilty of defamation and ordered her pay him the equivalent of $66,000 in damages in 2011. Yet even this did not stop her, Clayworth said, as she left court and immediately began posting more pictures and comments. The judge then ordered her to be jailed for contempt of court but she fled the country. Relentless: Clayworth's name and picture appears on numerous websites such as 'liarscheatersrus.com' No giving up: Even when a court found her guilty of defamation, Yan continued to post messages . In an unprecedented move, the court also told search engine . providers Google, Yahoo and Bing to block Clayworth's name from search engines, but the companies have said this is impossible. 'Even if we did remove the name it would not make the content disappear . from other places on the web, since Google’s search results are a . reflection of the content and information that is available on the web,' Google spokesperson Wendy Bairos said. 'Users who . want content removed from the internet should contact the webmaster of . the page directly.' Clayworth . said he has also gone done this avenue - getting mixed responses from . webmasters - but even when the posts are taken down, Yan will just put . them back up again. He has even gone to Vancouver police, in the hope of getting an international arrest warrant for Yan. Cruel: She uploaded naked photos of Clayworth and emailed his friends to say he'd had sex with students . But authorities said they are only able to get a Canada-wife warrant for the arrest - which is useless as Clayworth believes she is in Australia. Det. Mark Fenton said he understood Clayworth's frustrations. 'The internet and society has moved at . such a fast pace, that government and law enforcement are unable to . keep pace,' said Fenton. 'This is a huge mess... and it feels awful.' For now Clayworth said he can merely continue to contact websites, search for jobs with good references from previous posts - and warn students against the memory of the internet. 'Everything that was digital and saved in my life - whether it was in the hard drive or laptop - is just at the disposal of this woman,' said Clayworth. 'It will never stop... it will go on and on.'","Lee David Clayworth dated Lee Ching Yan for several months in Malaysia .

"By . Matt Blake . PUBLISHED: . 10:32 EST, 21 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:02 EST, 21 August 2013 . Joseph Elone who died after collapsing in his garden may have been killed by a deadly tick bite . An honour role student who died after collapsing in his garden may have been killed by a deadly tick bite, it has been claimed. Joseph Elone, 17, fell to the ground in his yard in Poughkeepsie, New York, just after midnight on the eve of his mother's birthday following two weeks with a minor cough, fatigue and a headache, his family said. Doctors now believe he died of a Powassan encephalitis transmitted through a tick bite. The state is on high alert after the Health Department issued its third health advisory in four years about the deadly virus. Joseph had popped to the shops with mother Diane to buy throat sweets before the family threw a barbecue to celebrate her 49th birthday when he collapsed on August 4. As she went round the back to check on the food, Joseph headed for the front door. But he never made it. His father, Benedict, who was in the family home at the time, ran to his son when he saw him lying on his back on the lawn. 'I hugged my son, I called him,' he told NBC New York. 'He couldn't even answer' Joseph was rushed to hospital where medics . battled to save his life but he never regained consciousness and was . pronounced dead seven hours later. 'The whole idea … that he just dropped dead, that just blows my mind,' Mr Elon told the Poughkeepsie Journal. 'That is unfathomable.' Joseph, an . honour roll student who wanted to become an environmental engineer and . start a band, had been suffering from flu-like symptoms for two weeks . but doctors seemed baffled by his illness. Devastated: Joseph Elone's father Benedict said all he could do was hug his son as he lay dying in the family garden . Distraught: Joseph's father Benedict said the idea that his son is dead is 'unfathomable' Tagic: Joseph Elone's family home where he collapsed and died on the night before his mother's birthday . It was only after his death that a post mortem revealed he had died from myocarditis and meningitis, possibly from a rare virus, Powassan encephalitis. Dutchess County officials, citing initial testing, believe Elone may have been bitten by a tick infected with the virus, which is untreatable and can be transmitted by a bite in a matter of minutes. According to a recent study by the journal Parasites & Vectors, six per cent of ticks in the Hudson Valley carry a variant of Powassan encephalitis, which, while relatively small compared to other diseases, is surprisingly high for one so deadly, experts say. 'There are no diagnostic tests for the disease, and no treatments that are effective,' Dr. David Roth, co-chair of the Tick-Borne Disease Alliance, told NBC New York. Microscopic killer? Dutchess County officials, citing initial testing, believe Elone may have been bitten by a tick infected with the virus, which is untreatable and can be transmitted by a bite in a matter of minutes . Joseph did visit his doctor, complaining of his symptoms and was checked for Lyme disease and strep throat. But tests were negative. If confirmed, Joseph would be the third person in Dutchess County to have contracted Powassan and the first to die. Statewide, he would be the 16th case and the sixth death, according to the state Department of Health . According to the Poughkeepsie Journal, Joseph was a talented guitar player and artist who harboured dreams of launching a band. He also loved hiking, camping and kayaking, his brother Emmanuel told the paper. As a junior at Poughkeepsie High School, he was on the high honor roll and ranked 10th in the class, according to his family. 'He's a kid who knew who he was,' Mr Elone told NBC New York. 'He had all kinds of ambition. Teachers couldn't stop speaking well of him.' 'I just miss my son,' he said through tears. 'I just miss my son. I just miss my son.'","Joseph Elon, 17, collapsed on eve of mother's birthday as he prepared BBQ .

A father who was credited with helping to bring an end to last summer's riots accused a man of staring at his wife before punching him to the ground, a court has heard. Tariq Jahan, 46, allegedly assaulted Sajjad Ali after the pair got into an argument outside Mr Ali's workplace in Factory Road, Handsworth, on July 6 last year. Mr Ali told Birmingham Crown Court that Mr Jahan drove up to him in his car and said: 'Oi, why you staring at me?' before getting out, coming up to him and then accusing him of 'staring at my missus'. Tariq Jahan (left) allegedly assaulted Sajjad Ali (right) after they got into an argument outside Mr Ali's workplace in Factory Road, Handsworth, last July. Both are seen outside Birmingham Crown Court yesterday . Tariq Jahan (at the microphone) addresses community groups from across Birmingham at a peace rally protest in Summerfield Park last August. A week earlier, his son Haroon was killed after being struck by a car during the summer riots . Mr Ali, 34, alleges he was grabbed by the throat by the defendant, punched in the face and knocked to the floor, then kicked or punched while he was on the ground. Jahan, who denies one count of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and inflicting grievous bodily harm, made an emotional appeal for peace just hours after the death of his 21-year-old son in Birmingham in August. Haroon Jahan and brothers Shazad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31, were struck by a car in the early hours of August 10 during disorder in the Winson Green area of Birmingham. They were pronounced dead in hospital and hailed as heroes who died protecting homes and shops from looters. Tariq Jahan came into the public eye when Haroon (in photo) was killed while protecting their community from looters . Mr Jahan, of Winson Street, Winson Green, later made a heartfelt plea to crowds of youths gathered outside his home to end the disorder and 'go home'. His personal call for calm was credited with helping to bring an end to the riots. He subsequently received a Pride of Britain special recognition award for his compassion and dignity in the aftermath of his son's death. Mr Ali said he had not been staring at Mr Jahan when he started beeping the horn of his white Mitsubishi car as he waited in the narrow road - with a woman in the passenger seat - for Mr Ali and his colleague in a work van to move so he could pass. Mr Ali told the jury that Mr Jahan's manner was 'really aggressive' when he approached him and accused him of staring. He said he thought the attack lasted five minutes or less but he did not know if a number of blows he received while he was on the floor were kicks or punches. Mr Ali was taken to hospital by his manager and treated for two fractures to his jaw. He also lost two teeth and had bruises to the left temple area of his face. Ali Naseem Bajwa, QC, defending Jahan, suggested to Mr Ali that he had been the aggressor in the incident after he became annoyed that Jahan was beeping his car horn to get him to move. Jahan stopped his car and asked him if he was a Hindu, Pakistani, Sikh, Muslim or Iraqi and said a few words to him in Punjabi, Mr Bajwa told the court. 'Your response was to say: 'F*** off you grey-haired old fart. Why should I tell you? He got out of his car and asked you the same question. You responded by trying to head butt him.' From left, Haroon Jahan and brothers Shazad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31, all died after being hit by a car in the early hours of August 10 . Mr Bajwa said the pair got into a scuffle before Mr Ali was punched once to the side of the jaw, which caused him to fall to his knees. Mr Ali repeated: 'That's not true' when Mr Bajwa said the defendant did not lay one finger or foot on him while he was on his knees. The incident was reported to police on July 6 and the white Mitsubishi traced to the home address of Mr Jahan two days later, when police arrested and questioned him. The trial continues.

We've all had those heart-sink moments when we've opened the door to an unwanted salesman or uninvited neighbour. Now there's a new app that lets you know exactly who's at your front door - and it works when you're not at home. The app, called iDoorCam, works with a tiny camera mounted to a doorbell-like button. When a visitor presses the bell it sends . an alert and activates the camera so the owner can decide to answer the . call, or reject it, depending on who is visiting. Scroll down for video . The iDoorCam app, right, is free for iOS and Android devices but only works with the iDoorCam button, left, that costs £105. The device replaces the doorbell button and includes a camera, speaker, microphone, LED light, infrared LED (night-vision) and a motion sensor . For people without an Android or iOS device, a schoolboy has created a doorbell that fools burglars into believing somebody is home at an empty property but calls any mobile phone. Smart Bell, designed by 13-year-old Laurence Rook, dials the homeowner's mobile phone when pressed, allowing them to talk to whoever is outside their front door. The device even produces a small amount of white noise to give any unexpected guest the impression they are speaking to someone inside the house on an intercom system. The invention, which uses an inbuilt SIM card and existing mobile-phone technology, would also allow homeowners to give instructions to drivers making deliveries at their property. If answered, the owner can then speak to and hear the person at their front door, using the app on their iOS or Android device. The owner can even do this when they're not at home. The iDoorCam app is free for iOS and Android tablets and phones, but only works with the iDoorCam device that costs £105. It replaces the doorbell button and connects to Wi-Fi before sending the alert to a mobile phone. The device itself includes a camera, speaker, microphone, LED light, infrared LED (night-vision) and a motion sensor. Desiree Mejia, CEO of iDoorCam, from California, explains how she and other co-founder Andrew Thomas, 29, came up with the idea. The 42-year-old said: 'I was always on the go and wanted a solution to stay connected to my home while I was working or travelling. When a visitor presses the wall mounted button, left,  the device connects to the home's Wi-Fi network and sends an alert to the owner's phone. The user can then decide to answer the call based on who is there, record them or take a picture, and speak to the visiting guest . 'I then found comfort in the idea of always knowing who is at the door whether I was home or not - the idea took off from there. 'One of the best things about iDoorCam is the advanced feature set. We're designing things that have not been done yet on a WiFi doorbell. 'This includes motion sensor call and image initiation, on-demand camera access, and a feature we call 'Do Not Disturb' mode. 'You can even use the app to turn off your home's doorbell so it does not wake a sleeping baby or disturb you while you're working. 'The iDoorCam will help homeowners and other users feel safe by allowing them to see who is that their door and it gives them control over how they want to answer it.'","The iDoorCam smartphone app works with a camera mounted to a doorbell .

Hard times: She says her leg would break out in blisters from the summer heat and dragging on the floor while winter would bring frostbite as she never had any clothes to cover it properly . The growth, a tumour composed chiefly of fat cells, is completely benign but rendered her unable to work or enjoy a normal life. 'Whenever the summer came, my leg would break out in blisters from the heat and the fact it would constantly rub on the concrete floor,' she said. 'And when winter came, I even got frostbite because I didn't have clothes that would fit around it. That was incredibly itchy.' To make matters worse for Sun, her father died of kidney failure 12 years ago, and her mother is suffering from terminal esophageal cancer. 'My mother lives a very difficult life,' she added.

Conservative party divisions over green energy widened today, after climate change minister Greg Barker hailed wind farms as ‘wonderful’ and ‘rather majestic’. Mr Barker appeared to take a swipe at his Tory colleague John Hayes, who has made plain his opposition to more turbines ‘peppering’ the countryside. The government is expected to commit to a major expansion in gas generation, with up to 30 new power stations in operation by 2030. Tory minister Greg Barker joined David Cameron on the now famous 2006 trip to the Scott Turner Glacier on the island of Svalbard inside the Arctic circle . Tory split: Climate change minister Greg Barker says wind farms can be 'majestic' but energy minister John Hayes insists 'enough is enough' and he does not want more peppering the countryside . The move, due to be announced by George Osborne in tomorrow’s Autumn Statement, has angered green campaigners who accuse the coalition of abandoning a promise to be the ‘greenest government ever’. Mr Barker, who joined David Cameron on his infamous hug-a-huskie trip to the Artcic in 2006, insisted the PM was still committed to the environmental agenda. ‘The idea that the huskies have been put to sleep is nonsense,’ he told the Financial Times. ‘I have no doubt at all about the prime minister’s green convictions.’ He added that unlike Mr Hayes he did not object to ‘wonderful’ wind turbines, and even claimed one near his Sussex constituency had become ‘almost a tourist attraction’. Mr Cameron's Arctic jaunt was seen as key to burnishing his credentials as opposition leader . Dozens of Tory MPs have urged Mr Cameron to row back on green energy policies. Mr Barker said: ‘I understand the worries of these groups around specific sites, however that shouldn’t be seen as a rowing back to our wider commitment to the renewable agenda.’ However, Mr Hayes appeared to back the Tory rebels in an interview with the Mail in October when he signalled an end to new turbines, declaring ‘enough is enough’. He revealed he had commissioned research on the impact of wind turbines on the landscape and whether they drive down house prices. He has also asked scientists to examine noise complaints and more sinister suggestions that the turbines endanger military aircraft by blocking radar signals. Mr Hayes said: ‘The onshore wind debate is skewing the whole debate, which is not good for the Government, not good for people and not good for the renewables lobby. ‘We can no longer have wind turbines imposed on communities. I can’t single-handedly build a new Jerusalem but I can protect our green and pleasant land. ‘Firstly, I have asked the planning minister to look again at the relationship between these turbines and the landscape. ‘It seems extraordinary to have allowed them to be peppered around the country without due regard for the interests of the local community or their wishes. ‘We have issued a call for evidence on wind. That is about cost but also about community buy-in. We need to understand communities’ genuine desires.’ The comments sparked a furious row with his boss, Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey, who wrote to Mr Cameron warning Mr Hayes’ continued presence in the department risked future legal challenges. But Number 10 did not respond, and in a list of ministerial responsibilities published last week, Mr Hayes was listed as having renewable energy in his brief.","Climate change minister Greg Barker also claims turbines in his Bexhill and Battle constituency are a 'tourist attraction'

Laid back: Pope Francis will hold the papal Holy Thursday service in Casal del Marmo, a youth jail on the outskirts of Rome, where he will wash the feet of 12 inmates . After only a week at the helm of the Catholic Church, he has already earned himself the nickname the People's Pope due to his candid nature and willingness to break from tradition. But even the most ardent reformers within the church will raise an eyebrow at Pope Francis's latest proposal, as the Vatican announced that he will hold next week's Holy Thursday service in a youth prison. During the service at the Casal del Marmo jail, situated on the outskirts of Rome, the Argentine pontiff is expected to wash and kiss the feet 12 prisoners. The 76-year-old's gesture reflects that of Jesus on the night of the Last Supper, when he washed the feet of his disciples. The ceremony carries added poignancy, given that it will be the first Holy Thursday service held outside either St Peter's Basilica or the basilica of St John in Lateran. Since being elected to head the church following Pope Benedict XVI's historic decision to step down, Pope Francis has surprised senior Vatican officials by staging spontaneous walkabouts. He also prompted a receptionist to exclaim 'If you're the Pope, I'm Napoleon' during conversation when he called a Jesuit residence in Rome only to be put through to the switchboard. But his decision to break with tradition for next week's service will surprise nobody in his native Argentine, where he washed the feet of Aids sufferers and met with sex workers. His predecessor Pope Benedict also washed the feet of lay people in his first two years in the Vatican, but only performed the gesture on priests since 2008. People's Pope: Francis has established a reputation for being laid back due to his desire to break from tradition . Break from tradition: It will be the first Holy Thursday service held outside either St Peter's Basilica (pictured) or the basilica of St John in Lateran . Meeting: Pope Francis, pictured meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel, will fly to have lunch with his predecessor Benedict XVI before the prison service . John Paul II washed the feet of a group of homeless men in 1980 but the mass was held in the Bishop of Rome's cathedral. For most of his tenure however, Pope John Paul II only performed the gesture on members of the clergy. The Vatican said that next week's ceremony will be a continuation of his work as the archbishop of Buenos Aires, when he celebrated the holy day in shelters, hospitals and prisons. The 'context of simplicity' has underpinned much of Pope Francis's life in the church - he is known to take the bus, prefer smaller residences and wear old shoes. Francis's visit to the youth prison will be the its second papal visit. Benedict XVI travelled there in 2007, although not during Holy Week. Individual: While Archbishop of Buenos Aires he was known to take the bus, wear his old shoes and spend time with the disadvantaged . Before his visit, Francis will fly to Castel Gandolfo where Benedict XVI has been living since quitting the Vatican for health reasons. The pair will have a lunch meeting, while both wearing papal white robes. It is still unsure where Francis will choose to live, as maintenance work is being carried out on the Apostolic Palace, but Benedict XVI will move into an apartment within the Vatican in a matter of weeks. Pope . Francis' informal style got the better of him when he telephoned a . Vatican receptionist directly and was told: 'And I'm Napoleon.'

Japan’s nuclear crisis escalated yesterday, with fears that more tanks at the wrecked Fukushima plant are leaking contaminated water. The Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) plans to upgrade the severity of the release from a level 1 ‘anomaly’ to a level three ‘serious incident’. The tanks were hastily built to store water washed over melted reactors at the station to keep them cool in the wake of the 2011 tsunami. Scroll down for video . Contaminated: A Tepco worker at the storage tanks that are filled with radioactive water from the clean-up . Disturbing sign: This picture shows contaminated water leaking from the storage tank. Tepco says it has not reached the sea . The plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric . Power Co (Tepco), said on Tuesday that water with dangerously high . levels of radiation is leaking from one tank, but the NRA is worried . about other tanks of the same type. A person standing near the leak would receive five times the annual radiation limit for nuclear workers. China . said it was ‘shocked’ to hear about the leak and urged Japan to provide . information ‘in a timely, thorough and relevant way’. About 300 tonnes of water has breached a storage tank at the plant. Experts say that after 10 hours, a . worker in that proximity to the leak would develop radiation sickness . with symptoms including nausea and a drop in white blood cells. Nuclear chemist and professor emeritus at Nagoya University, Michiaki Furukawa, said: 'That is a huge amount of radiation - the . situation is getting worse.' It is the latest leak to beset the troubled plant in recent weeks, according to operator Tokyo Electric Power. The embattled utility firm Tokyo Electric has struggled to keep the Fukushima site under control since the 2011 natural disaster hit the plant. A Tokyo Electric official said that . workers who were monitoring storage tanks appeared to have failed to . detect the leak of water which pooled up around the tank. Leak: The operator of Japan's crippled Fukushima nuclear plant said about 300 tonnes of contaminated water seeped out of a storage tank . He said: 'We failed to discover the leak at an early stage and we need to review not only the tanks but also our monitoring system.' The NRA's impending assessment upgrade came in a document posted on the agency's website today. The upgrade is set to follow a meeting held by the authority's commissioners, the NRA spokesman said. 'Judging from the amount and the density of the radiation in the contaminated water that leaked ... a level 3 assessment is appropriate,' the document said. Following the earthquake and tsunami, Fukushima was assigned the highest rating of Level 7, when it was hit by explosions after a loss of power and cooling. Continued contaminated water leaks from Fukushima have alarmed Japan's neighbours South Korea and China. Tokyo Electric, also known as Tepco, has been criticised for its failure to prepare for the disaster and been accused of covering up the extent of the problems at the plant. Massive amounts of radioactive fluids are accumulating at the Fukushima plant as Tepco floods reactor cores via a jerry-rigged system to keep melted uranium fuel rods cool and stable. The water in the improvised cooling system then flows into basements and trenches that have been leaking since the disaster. Highly contaminated excess water is pumped out and stored in steel tanks on elevated ground away from the reactors, which lie adjacent to the coast. Monitor: A group of staff monitor progress at the site of reactor four at the Japanes nuclear plant . About 400 tonnes of radioactive water per day has been pooling and kept in storage at Fukushima. In order to keep up with the pace of the contaminated water flow, Tepco has mostly relied on tanks that are bolted together with plastic sealing around the joints. Those tanks are less robust, but quicker to assemble, than the welded tanks that the utility has recently started installing. The latest leak came from the more fragile type of tank, which Tepco plans to keep using, although it is looking at ways to improve their strength, said Tepco official Masayuki Ono. Tepco said it did not believe that water from the latest leak had reached the ocean, which is only about 500 metres away. A puddle that formed near the leaking . tank is emitting a radiation dose of 100 millisieverts an hour about 50 . centimetres above the water surface, Ono told reporters at a press . briefing. In . recent months the plant has been beset with power outages and other . problems that have led outside experts to question whether Tepco is . qualified to handle the cleanup, which is unprecedented due to the . amount of radioactive material on the site and its coastal location. Carnage: This is how Fukushima looked after the explosions at the nuclear power plant, caused by a tsunami in 2011 . The Government said this month it will step up its involvement in the plant's cleanup, following Tepco's admission - after months of denial - that leaked contaminated water had reached the ocean. Tepco has also struggled with worker safety. This month, 12 workers decommissioning the plant were found to have been contaminated by radiation. The utility has not yet identified what caused those incidents, which only came to its notice when alarms sounded as the workers prepared to leave the job site. A South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed on Tuesday media reports that Seoul had asked Japanese officials to publicly explain what they were doing to stop contaminated water reaching the Pacific Ocean and valuable fishing grounds. Furukawa said: 'Tepco and the government must come up with ways to stop the leaks as well as to monitor and analyze how much and what sort of radiation is entering the ocean, as well as the affect it is having on fish and sea plants. 'They also need to make the information available to the public, all over the world, given this is the first case in history where contaminated water from a nuclear plant is flowing into the ocean at this magnitude.' Devastating: The nuclear reactor exploded with serious consequences when it was struck by a tsunami that had in turn been caused by an earthquake .","Workers failed to spot highly contaminated water leaking from tank .

Exactly 30 years after a 22-year-old college student who was dating actor-director Robert Redford's daughter was discovered dead from a gunshot wound to the head, Colorado police believe they may be one step closer to making an arrest in the cold case. Boulder police issued a statement Wednesday saying they're looking for Thayne Smika, who is still being sought after a murder warrant was issued for his arrest in 2010. They're seeking the public's help on the 30th anniversary of Sid Wells' death. Wells' brother found his body August 1, 1983, in Wells' Spanish Towers condominium. An autopsy showed Wells was shot execution-style at point-blank range in the back of the head with a 20-guage shotgun. Victim: University of Colorado journalism student Sid Wells, 22, was gunned down August 1, 1983, in his condominium . Suspect's many faces: Boulder police released (clockwise) murder suspect Thayne Smika's original mugshot and a series of age-progressed sketches showing what he might look like now with glasses and facial hair . The case attracted worldwide media attention when Redford halted production of The Natural, being filmed on location in Buffalo, N.Y., and came to Boulder for Wells' funeral. Wells and Redford's daughter Shauna, then 22 years old, were both students at the University of Colorado and lived in the same building. Smika, who was often late with rent, was supposed to pay Wells the day he was killed, investigators said. Police suspected Smika, Wells' roommate, and arrested him a few months after investigators said they linked him to the murder. Smika was never prosecuted because the district attorney at the time declined to take the case. Smika left the area, and in 1986 his abandoned car was found in Beverly Hills, Calif. Wells' mother, June Menger, said Thursday that Boulder investigators have been dogged in their work to solve the case. Young lovers: Wells (right) and Robert Redford's daughter, Shauna (left), both attended University of Colorado and dated for three years until the boyfriend's murder . Warrior: Wells was part of the university¿s Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps . Sensless loss: Wells aspired to be a journalist, was a dedicated student and had many friends . She said she isn't bitter about the delays in getting a murder warrant. Prosecutors at the time of the killing lacked the evidence techniques that have since allowed detectives to link shotgun pellets recovered from Wells' body to shells found at the Smika family residence in Akron, Menger said. She said Robert Redford and her son were friends, and they went jogging and skiing together. She said Redford initially decided not to attend the funeral, worried it would become a media circus. But he came anyway because of his close friendship with Wells. ‘He said it had turned into his nightmare too,’ she said. Redford said in 1997 that Wells' murder still haunted him. ‘It's like a partially opened door with a very dark room behind it,’ he said. Horrifying scene: Sid's brother discovered the 22-year-old's body in his Spanish Towers condo . Gristly: Autopsy showed Wells was shot execution-style at point-blank range in the back of the head with a 20-guage shotgun . Prime suspect: Smika, Wells' roommate, was arrested a few months after the murder, but he was never prosecuted because the district attorney at the time declined to take the case . In 2010, the Boulder County district attorney's office agreed to review the case and approved an arrest affidavit for Smika. But authorities could not find him. Smika's bail was set at $5million after the warrant was issued. Boulder Deputy Police Chief Dave Hayes, one of the first detectives to investigate the case, said Smika may have become assimilated into a community and he hopes new coverage of the case will lead a neighbor or a relative to step forward. ‘It's time for justice,’ said Hayes, who has remained in touch with Wells' family over the last three decades. Thayne Smika, who is believed to be living under an assumed identity, would be 54 now. Police released his 1983 mugshot and an age-progressed image of what he might look like today. True friend: Robert Redford, pictured comforting his weeping daughter, initially decided not to attend Wells' funeral, worried it would become a media circus, but he came anyway . Bereaved: Shauna Redford dated Sid Wells for three years, was his best friends, and in his obituary she was listed among his survivors . In 1997, a police officer posing as a journalism student talked to Smika's mother, who said her son had changed his name because he was afraid for his life because he knew who the real killer was. An aspiring journalist, Wells also was part of the university’s Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps. For his first date with Shauna Redford, the two went to an ROTC dance, the site Daily Camera reported. Shauna, the daughter of Robert Redford and his first wife, Lola Van Wagenen, whom he divorced in 1985, dated Sid Wells for three years, and in his obituary she was listed among his survivors. Moving on: Shauna, pictured left with her actor-director father in 1997, went on to marry journalist and best-selling author Eric Schlosser (right), and the couple have two children . A photo that accompanied a 1983 Associated Press article about Wells’ funeral showed the weeping young woman being comforted by her father on their way to the service. Following the murder, Shauna went on to marry university professor Eric Schlosser, the best-selling author of Fast Food Nation. The couple have two children, a boy and a girl.","Thayne Smika, now 54, is being sought in 1983 murder of 22-year-old Sid Wells .

An adventurous cat has been reunited with her owner after she was found two months after going missing - almost 500 miles from home. Mystery surrounds how Gypsy found her way from her home in Portsmouth, Hampshire, all the way up to Motherwell in Scotland. But her relived owner Lisa Chamberlain thinks her beloved pet may have inadvertently hitched a seven-and-a-half hour ride on a delivery truck. She said: 'I couldn't believe it when I got the call from the SPCA (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) up in Scotland. Found: Relieved owner Lisa Chamberlain, pictured right with son Macauley, said she couldn't believe it when the SPCA called to say that Gypsy, left, had been found almost 500 miles from home . 'They said Gypsy is really underweight but is good in herself. 'No one knows what might have happened. Maybe she accidentally got on a lorry or something, who knows.' Gypsy was discovered crying in Motherwell by a woman who took her to the nearest Scottish SPCA centre in Hamilton, Lanarkshire. Staff there looked after the cat by providing her with food and water after it emerged she had lost three quarters of her body weight. Gypsy's travels began when Lisa left her bathroom window open on August 20. Having fed and watered her three cats by 8.30pm, she settled down for the evening and only realised her black and brown feline was missing the next morning. She said: 'Every evening I get my cats in before I have a bath. However, after I'd finished, I left the bathroom window open. 'I must have left the bathroom door open and she must have escaped out of the window.' But, much to the delight of her family, almost nine weeks after she went missing, Gypsy was safely returned at 11pm last night by courier. Lorraine Alba, assistant manager at the Scottish SPCA's Lanarkshire Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre in Hamilton, said: 'When Gypsy arrived in our care we scanned her for a microchip. 'We were very surprised to learn her owner lived in Portsmouth. 'We're not entirely sure how she ended up in Motherwell but it's possible she jumped in a delivery van or on to a train. 'Gypsy went missing in August so her owner was understandably delighted to learn she had been found, albeit over 400 miles from home. 'This is a fantastic example of the benefits of microchipping as it's highly unlikely we would have been able to trace Gypsy's owner had she not been chipped.

As the heatwave engulfing Britain shows no signs of abating, it seems men are seeking new ways to stay cool in the office. Rather than sweating it out in a full suit, men are opting for smart, tailored shorts that can be teamed with a shirt and jacket. This Bermuda type look has become so popular that some shops are reporting over a 200 per cent rise in sales from last year. John Lewis have seen a risei n sales of over 200 per cent on last years figuresd. Pictured are the McAvoy twill shorts, £45 . As temperatures reached the mid-thirties last week, John Lewis reported their best ever week for short sales, with sales of smart shorts up a massive 226 per cent on last year (not entirely surprising, given the cool summer we endured), and 33 per cent higher than the previous bestselling week. The trend for above-the-knee shorts was a major look at Richard James, Junya . Watanabe and Raf Simons on the spring/summer 13 catwalks and, since then, tailored shorts have begun surfacing as officewear for overheated city dwellers, whether worn with a . casual polo shirt or as part of a smart suit. This trend sees a move away from the short-shorts craze that has been adopted by stars like Joey Essex. Last week high street sales data revealed that demand for men’s shorts that sit at the top of thighs, rather than knees had shot up by 156 per cent in the previous week alone. The tailored shorts evoke a slightly more sophisticated feel: more elegant post-work cocktails on the terrace than dodgy Wham throwback, and is the sort of look that will see British men looking cool yet chic in the workplace and beyond. The high street has quickly adapted to cater to this trend and wide ranges of tailored shorts are available at shops from Marks and Spencer to George at Asda. Chino Shorts £19.50, teamed with Blue Harbour Bomber £49.50, T-Shirt £12.50, and Blue Harbour Boat Shoes £49.50, all from Marks and Spencer . The current best-selling styles at John Lewis include the private label chino, belted cargo and linen short styles in reds, bright blues and greens – adding a real point of difference and to some, a controversial twist to the ‘office’ look. Nick Keyte, Head of Menswear Buying at John Lewis, says, ‘Last week alone, shorts sales rose by 52 per cent, week on week. ‘The tailored short offers our male customer a stylish sartorial solution and alternative to the traditional trouser that maintains a level of cool for summer. ‘Our customers are dressing up their shorts with brogues, desert boots and loafers for a more formal look in the office.’ Boston Crew Oxford Shorts, £14 George Asda .

The England forward was on Tuesday night understood to be ‘angry and confused’ over comments by new manager David Moyes that he will not be sold because he provides important back-up forfirst-choice striker Robin van Persie. Rooney is also furious over the stance taken by new United chief executive Ed Woodward, who insisted no contract talks will take place this summer with the club preferring to monitor Rooney’s progress over the coming season. Declaration: Wayne Rooney is reportedly angry and confused over his Manchester United future . Strike a pose: Rooney feels he has nothing to prove after nine seasons at Old Trafford .

If United decide to let him leave, they would prefer not to sell to a . domestic rival. They have already discussed the possible scenarios and . believe that out of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, the . French champions would be their preferred buyer. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho added more fuel to his interest in Rooney on Tuesday by warning that England’s World Cup hopes could suffer if he . stays at United.

Despite warnings from campaigners, the online shop is selling salvia and describing it as ‘more powerful than LSD’. Nitrous oxide and poppers, which can be similarly lethal, are on sale as well. Maryon Stewart, whose daughter Hester died after taking the drug GBL, wrote to Amazon last month, asking it to withdraw the products along with drug pipes, bongs and scales. Under fire: Online retailer is selling Salvia, despite warnings from campaigners . Danger: Maryon Stewart (left), whose daughter Hester (right) died after taking the drug GBL, wrote to Amazon last month . She has had no response and last night said: ‘It is utterly irresponsible that Amazon is selling this stuff and tantamount to an endorsement. ‘Amazon is a trusted brand and if it is selling something, it is likely to mislead young people into believing it’s safe. ‘We all know these products are not safe and people taking them are playing Russian roulette with their lives and mental wellbeing.’ EBay does not allow legal highs or drugs equipment to be sold through its site because it says they may ‘cause harm’. But packets of ‘pure salvia extract’ are sold on Amazon Marketplace by a firm called John Strong Supplies. It boasts of providing ‘the purest extracts at the best prices in the UK’ and cites Press articles describing the psychoactive herb as ‘more powerful than LSD, and legal’. It states: ‘Salvia continues to be used by Mazatec shamans in its native Oaxaca for its spiritual effects, which last for five minutes and offer the shamans deep psychological effects.’ Legal highs: Nitrous oxide and poppers were also on sale on the Amazon website . A disclaimer says the £7.99 product is a ‘herbal incense for the home’ but customer reviews make clear what it is used for. One buyer said: ‘I can testify that this salvia is one of the best I’ve ever smoked. Buy, try, and fly high guys.’ Another praised ‘an amazing trip’. Drug experts warn salvia can trigger psychotic episodes, particularly in young people and those with mental health problems. It was linked to the death of Ryan Santanna, a 21-year-old film student who fell from a balcony in New York after smoking it in 2011. Harry Shapiro of the charity DrugScope said that, at high doses, salvia has similar effects to LSD, triggering hallucinations and distorting time. Salvia was linked to the death of Ryan Santanna, a 21-year-old film student who fell from a balcony in New York after smoking it in 2011 . ‘There is the danger with hallucinogenic drugs that people can injure themselves because they are seeing something that isn’t there,’ he added. ‘There is the very odd case of people who believe they can fly. And, of course, people can just get scared by whatever it is that they see.’ Nitrous oxide – known as laughing gas – can cause seizures, heart attacks and strokes. Last year public schoolboy Joseph Benett, 17, died after inhaling it with his friends. He suffered a heart attack and brain damage. Nitrous oxide is widely abused as a middle class party drug and by students looking for a quick high. It is often inhaled directly from party balloons. Alarming side-effects include hallucinations, seizures, blackouts and incontinence. Drug experts warn it is especially dangerous with alcohol. Amyl nitrate – known as poppers – is also on sale on Amazon as a ‘bottled room aroma’. But the product descriptions make clear its intended use, 'working its magic’ with ‘heightened mood sensations’. The Government’s drug website warns that poppers can cause death by reduced oxygen to vital organs. In June 2011, Eric James, a 46-year-old married father, died after inhaling amyl nitrate on Clapham Common. It has proved impossible to prosecute over the sale of poppers because sellers can claim the product is a deodoriser. Nitrous oxide can also be sold legally because it is used as a pressurised gas for spray cream cans. Government drugs advisers considered – but did not call for – a ban on salvia in 2011. Last night a spokesman for Amazon said: ‘All sellers on Amazon Marketplace must adhere to our guidelines in relation to the products that they make available for sale on our web site, and we use a variety of methods to ensure compliance. ‘We act quickly to remove any items that contravene our guidelines and take appropriate action with the seller in question.’ Last night salvia and nitrous oxide were still widely available but it appeared Amazon had acted to remove amyl nitrate.

Convert: Bellfield, who sources claim has turned to Islam, was given a second life term in June for killing schoolgirl Milly Dowler . The killer of schoolgirl Milly Dowler has changed his name and is converting to Islam in jail, it has been claimed. Levi Bellfield, 43, is now called Mohammed, only eats halal meat and prays to Allah five times a day at Wakefield Prison. The triple murderer is serving a second whole life sentence for killing Milly, 13, at Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002. He was already in jail for murdering Marsha McDonnell, 19, in 2003 and Amelie Delagrange, 22, as well as attempting to murder Kate Sheedy, 18, in 2004. Staff at Wakefield prison, in West Yorkshire, believe Bellfield has only changed his faith to gain special treatment at the jail. It is also thought he may have made the lifestyle change to impress the Muslim extremists who have given him a hard time while he has been incarcerated there. A prison insider told the Daily Mirror: 'His diet must be cooked to halal guidelines. It is generally accepted the food is better. 'Bellfield is doing this for better meals and a cushier life. He has the right to pray five times a day so it gives him a break. 'Some staff think he may have become a Muslim to impress the extremists he had trouble with.' Staff at Wakefield Prison are reported to have said that Bellfield has only changed his faith to get special treatment . Bellfield, who is 6ft tall and weighs around 18 stone, has repeatedly complained about his personal security. Sources at the prison suggested earlier this year that Bellfield spends the majority of his time in his cell surrounded by legal papers and books because of fears he will be attacked. It emerged in August that the serial killer could be in line for a compensation payout of up to £30,000 after suffering cuts and bruises in a prison attack. Bellfield is waiting to cash in on a minor assault which took place before he went on trial for the murder of Milly. After his conviction, Milly’s mother Sally said she hoped he would be dealt with in prison with the ‘same brutality’ he used against his victims.

A blind man who had surgery to help him see has passed his driving test - just seven weeks after he regained his sight. Joseph Lewis, from Newport, South Wales, had suffered with extremely poor vision his whole life, and his outlook on life was bleak after he developed cataracts six months ago, forcing him to lose the little sight he had. But after a complicated operation prevented him from a lifetime of blindness and enabled him to see, the ambitious 26-year-old has just passed his driving test, seven weeks after his surgery. Driving: Joseph Lewis has just passed his driving test, seven weeks after a sight-saving operation. His outlook on life was bleak after he developed cataracts six months ago . Mr Lewis said: 'I had always wanted to be able to drive but it seemed impossible, especially once the cataracts developed. 'I just didn’t know how my vision would be after the surgery - before I couldn’t read a car number plate at 10 metres, let alone 20 metres, but now I can see far into the distance, it is incredible.' Mr Lewis would not have qualified for surgical intervention on the NHS until he was blind, so he sought advice from a private eye treatment specialist and underwent a risky operation to give him sight. Mr Lewis said: 'Some surgeons felt that I was too high risk to operate on but I knew that I would soon be completely blind if I did nothing. Operation: Mr Lewis, 26, wouldn't qualify for NHS treatment until he was completely blind so he consulted a private doctor . 'I have suffered depression due to how my vision affects my life and I thought I would never be able to drive, so I have always been very dependent on other people.' During the complicated life-changing operation, Mr Lewis' surgeon removed the cataracts and replaced his natural lenses with artificial ones, which have been surgically implanted into his eyes and work in the same way as the most advanced lenses in a pair of glasses. Mr Lewis said: 'Good vision is a gift and I hope that I never take it for granted. I couldn’t believe how many stars there are in the night sky, and most importantly, I have just passed my driving test - only seven weeks after the surgery. That was something I never thought I would be able to do in my life.'

The church defector, who released a tell-all book on her escape from Scientology in February, also claims Brad Pitt was courted by the church in the 90s and went through its drug detoxification program while dating actress and well-known Scientology member Juliette Lewis. ‘I know he was receiving Scientology auditing and was at one of the Celebrity Centre Galas,’ Hill told Radar Online in an exclusive interview posted Wednesday. So why would Bono, a man known for his kindness and constant concern for humanity be in need of the church’s self-improvement techniques? Scientologist? The niece of Scientology leader David Miscavige says rocker Bono was once actively courted by the Church of Scientology's leaders . ‘Scientology markets itself to everyone,’ Hill said in an exclusive interview with Radaronline. ‘It can deal with everything from marital problems to public speaking. He’s a human, so he still needs those things.’ As the daughter of Miscavige’s brother Ron, Hill spent her childhood in the church and detailed her time on the inside and with its ultra-secret Sea Org in a much ballyhooed recounting titled Beyond Belief: My Secret Life Inside Scientology and My Harrowing Escape. She escaped to tell her tale only after 21 years, and Bono’s alleged courting by the mysterious organization comes as big a surprise as any she’s released. Defector: Jenna Miscavige Hill is the niece of Scientology leader David Miscavige. She wrote a tell-all on the religion released in February and is now naming celebrities who've dabbled in the religion . Surprise! Jenna Miscavige Hill claims Brad Pitt went through Scientology's detox program called Purification Rundown while he dated actress Juliette Lewis in the 1990s . HQ: The Scientology church's Los Angeles celebrity center. Hill says she first learned of Brad Pitt's involvement with the church as a young girl. She says the church actively recruits celebrities . ‘If you’re egocentric, not always confident or insecure because of being in public eye and want to be charitable, Scientology pushes your buttons,’ explains Hill, ‘That’s why someone like Bono would fit the bill perfectly.’ According to Hill, it’s the celebrity that entices church officials like her uncle. More woes: The church has seen a number of troubles recently. Last month, Leah Remini defected from the church and stirred trouble with a quickly dismissed missing persons report about Miscavige's wife . ‘There’s a celebrity strategy and they’re targeted for their influence, not their money,’ she says, ‘They know people are obsessed with celebrities so will get more interested in Scientology.’ Another celebrity she claims was sought out by the church: Brad Pitt. Pitt’s name has come up in reference to Scientology before thanks to his relationship with actress Juliette Lewis, who remains a Scientologist to this day. Hill says Pitt was involved with the church’s drug detoxification program called Purification Rundown to help him stop using drugs he’s publicly blamed battles with depression, according to Radaronline. Lewis, too, says she has the church to thank for helping her kick a drug habit. Hill’s new revelations concerning the church of her upbringing are just a drop in the bucket of Scientology’s recent woes. Just this past Friday, MailOnline exclusively revealed photos of the Church of Scientology's 'alien space cathedral' built in a remote part of the New Mexico desert. The mysterious building leads to an underground vault which sits next to two giant symbols carved into the ground - believed to be markers for the religion's followers to find their way back from the ends of the universe after humanity is destroyed in the future. While no one knows the definite meaning of the pair of overlapping circles, each with a diamond in them, it is believed to have been trademarked by the Church of Technology, a branch of Scientology. It is believed that they are a ‘return point’ so members of the church know where they can find the works of founder L. Ron Hubbard when they come back from space after a nuclear catastrophe wipes out the human race. Imprisoned? Mail Online exclusively revealed photos of a secret New Mexico base where Jenna Hill claims her aunt, David Miscavige's long missing wife, is being held . Beacon? The home is allegedly part of a compound that acts as a secret base and homing beacon for space craft and for the church's followers to follow back to earth after a nuclear holocaust scatters them far into the universe . And last month, actress Leah Remini made headlines by fleeing the church. She subsequently piqued public interest in the church again by filing a missing persons report on Miscavige’s wife Shelly, who hasn’t been seen publicly in years. Remini has reportedly been offered ‘millions of dollars’ for a tell-all book on her many years with the church. The Church of Scientology did not immediately return emails or calls for comment on Hill’s accusations. However, a church spokesperson told Radar Online: . ‘At no time was Mrs. Hill ever privy to any ‘priorities’ or ‘strategies.’ As a result, she is in no position to comment and any claims to the contrary must be viewed with skepticism. Our priorities are and always have been the establishment and expansion of the Scientology religion.’","The niece of church leader David Miscavige claims the Irish rocker was a specific targeted by her uncle .

"By . James Nye . PUBLISHED: . 16:15 EST, 23 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:00 EST, 24 June 2012 . The chance encounter online between a gorgeous young 18-year-old girl named Jessi and a handsome 18-year-old marine called Thomas Montgomery seemed on the surface to be innocent enough. However, what Jessi, whose online name was Tallhotblonde, didn't know was that her 'sweet sexy Marine' was actually a 46-year-old married father of two from Clarence, in upstate New York. And what Montgomery didn't know until it was too late was that the beautiful girl who sent him underwear and promised marriage was in fact a 45-year-old woman called Mary Shieler who lived in Oak Hill, West Virginia. Scroll down for video . 46-year old Thomas Montgomery began a spiraling online affair which led to him murdering a love rival and discovering his alleged 18-year-old lover was in fact a 45-year-old woman . When Tallhotblonde began instant messaging Montgomery on a gaming chat room site, the Sunday School teacher was concerned about how it would look if he replied. Intrigued by the flirtatious nature of the messages and the beautiful profile pic the girl called 'Jessi' had, Montgomery decided to use the anonymity of the Internet and message her back pretending to be 18 too. Before long the messaging became romantic, but it ultimately led to the unraveling of Montgomery's marriage, the death of a co-worker, his own eventual imprisonment and the shocking twist which haunts him to this day. Giving himself the moniker 'MarineSniper', Montgomery told 'Jessi' that he was a young, handsome Iraq-bound Marine, while she claimed to be a softball-playing high school senior from West Virignia. A blurred picture of Jessi Shieler, the 18-year-old daughter of Mary Shieler, who used it under the online name Tallhotblonde . As the pair's online affair intensified, 'Jessi' began to send Montgomery extremely provocative photographs and he sent her a picture of himself from 30 years ago, when he was a member of the U.S. Marines. 'I kept thinking, well, we're never going to meet... I'll just play the game with her,' said Montgomery, whose tragic story has now been turned into a Lifetime Movie directed by 'Friends' Courtney Cox. The cyber-flirting, which began in May 2005, soon turned to cyber-sex as Montgomery lied about his history of covert ops, even though he never saw action during his stint in the military. Described by neighbours as a good man who worked for his daughters' swim team board, Montgomery's life slowly started to become fixated around his conversations online with 'Jessi.' She fed him photos from 'her' high school basketball team, softball team, graduation and prom as their relationship continued for months. On his part, Montgomery had created an alter-ego of himself as younger and stronger. 'He was my height, six-feet tall, had bright red hair,' said Montgomery to ABC News. 'Big shoulders, muscles and all that.' Online messages recovered between the lying pair revealed that the relationship had become dangerously obsessive for Montgomery who said it 'became more real to me than real life'. Thomas Montgomery sent 'Jessi' this picture of himself as 'MarineSniper'. It was in fact picture of himself taken thirty years beforehand . The exchange of gifts between the pair continued as did love letters. 'I love you always and forever, Tommy,' wrote 'Jessi'. 'I have never felt this way,' Montgomery replied. Wanting to end the affair, Montgomery found he couldn't and described it as like a 'drug'. It transpired that Mary Shieler was taking pictures of her daughter Jessi and passing them off as pictures of herself to Montgomery and other men online . It even seemed that he was losing touch with reality, as a note to himself proved. 'On January 2, 2006 Tom Montgomery (46-years-old) ceases to exist and is replaced by an 18-year-old battle-scarred marine... He is moving to West Virginia to be with the love of his life.' However, fate caught up with him as his wife Cindy found a package that 'Jessi' had sent to Montgomery which led her to his secret pile of photos, underwear and letters from West Virginia. Cindy took matters into her own hands and sent a letter back to the sender with a photo of her husband and his family. The picture that Cindy Montgomery (right) sent 'Jessi' of her family life with Thomas Montgomery . 'Let me introduce you to these people,' she wrote. 'The man in the centre is Tom, my husband since 1989... He is 46 years old.' Horrified, 'Jessi' sent Montgomery a text message ending the affair. 'She sends me a text message and says, she hates me... you should be put in jail for this,' said Montgomery to ABC News. A vengeful 'Jessi'/Mary Shieler then used the Internet to find a 22-year-old co-worker of Montgomery called Brian Barrett, setting in motion a tragic series of events which led to his murder. Brian Barrett was a 22-year-old co-worker of Thomas Montgomery and became the object of 'Jessi'/Mary Shieler's affections after she rejected Montgomery . She flirted online with Barrett, who called himself 'beefcake', on open forums for Montgomery to see. With both men believing that she was the gorgeous young thing in her profile pictures and keepsakes sent to them, the pair engaged in a furious rivalry. A blurred picture of Jessi Shiebler which her mother Mary sent to Thomas Montgomery when she was flirting online with him . 'Brian will pay in blood,' wrote Montgomery at one point to 'Jessi'. As the messages he sent to 'Jessi' became increasingly unhinged, Montgomery was embarrassed online by Barrett and Shieler as they posted his real age and picture onto forums, making him out to be a pedophile. Eventually, Barrett decided to visit 'Jessi' even though Shieler had warned him not to. Montgomery found out about this, became incensed and on September 15, 2006, drove to meet Barrett as he left where they both worked and shot him three times, killing him. As police responded to the murder, they quickly uncovered the internet love-triangle and when they couldn't find Montgomery, rushed to 'Jessi'. However, when police arrived at her door they were presented with 45-year-old Mary Shieler. Telling her what had happened and how they desperately needed to speak to Jessi, Shieler broke down in a wail of tears and confessed her whole elaborate deception of Montgomery and Barrett. Upon . questioning her, they discovered that Jessi was in fact her daughter . and the pictures and underwear she had been sending belonged to her . 18-year-old. It was later discovered that Shieler had flirted online, as 'Jessi', with . other men too, and once pointed a videocamera up her unaware . daughter's skirt for a video she sent to several men with the question, 'guys, do you like it?' Now 52, Thomas Montgomery is serving 20-years in Attica Prison in New York for the murder of Brian Barrett . Jessi had no knowledge of her mother's cyber-life. When the police apprehended Montgomery for the murder of Barrett they built up a strong case against him having found his DNA at the crime scene and a family photo which showed the gun used to shoot the 22-year-old. Montgomery pleaded guilty to Barrett's murder and was sentenced to 20-years. Prosecutors in New York desperately searched for a reason to charge Mary Shieler, but ultimately, could find no law she had broken. In her defence she claimed that she was keeping Montgomery online so that he couldn't talk to other teenagers. Shieler has never apologised to her daughter and her husband divorced her and Jessi cut off contact. Brian Barrett's parents began a petition to for laws to protect . against future Mary Shielers. But there seems to be no suggestion as to what . such laws would look like from lawmakers in New York.

It seemed like a fool-proof plan: lie back and pretend you’re dead while your friends carry you through the streets, demanding compensation for your brutal murder. And it might have worked for one crafty Chinese street vendor – only he had not counted on the effects of an unusually intense heat wave. Indeed, the heat was so unbearable the unidentified worker appeared to miraculously rise from the dead – and promptly demand a drink of water. Scroll down for video . A sheet-covered vendor's 'corpse' is carried on a gurney as his friends demand compensation for his 'brutal murder' The 'corpse' suddenly flung off his shroud, sat bolt upright and begged the crowd to quench his thirst . The farcical scene unfolded in Wuhan, roughly 700 miles south of Beijing in the central-eastern province of Hubei, The New York Times has reported. It started when a crowd of outraged ‘mourners’ carried a seemingly lifeless body on a makeshift gurney through the streets of the city. Among them were witnesses claiming he had been beaten to death by despised ‘urban management workers’. The body was covered with a sheet, but the witnesses insisted there was a badly beaten body underneath. Run-ins between street vendors and . authorities are commonplace. Several cases of conflicts ending in a . vendor’s death have outraged the nation. Urban . management agents – or ‘chengguan’, as they are known – are responsible . for dealing with sanitation complaints, unlicensed construction and . illegal peddling. The body was covered with a sheet, but witnesses insisted there was a badly beaten body underneath . Critics say their methods are heavy handed – confiscating goods and doling out stiff fines and stiffer beatings. With this backdrop, it’s easy to see why a crowd soon formed around the body – whipped into a frenzy as much by the injustice as by the insane heat of the day. Scores of people were soon surrounding the body, some with their shirts off and others trying to catch a bit of shade underneath umbrellas. The core group of demonstrators – the witnesses who had been there when the chengguan 'murder' took place - were demanding tens of thousands of yuan in compensation. As his friends' demands fell into a sheepish silence, the newly revived chengguan victim was given a bottle of water and allowed to go on his way . But, just when their demands were reaching fever pitch, the body under the sheet started twitching. Dramatically, the corpse suddenly flung off his shroud, sat bolt upright and begged the crowd to quench his thirst. As his friends’ demands fell into a sheepish silence, the newly revived chengguan victim was given a bottle of water and allowed to go on his way. It is unclear whether the local authorities intend to prosecute the man and his friends for their apparent scam, but there is no doubt that some Wuhan residents will forever check for signs of life when presented with a dead body.","Chinese vendor was carried through the streets pretending to be dead .

Change it: In an interview with the Associated Press yesterday, President Obama said if he were the owner of the Washington Redskins football team, he would change the name so as not to offend Native Americans . The filing has started rumors spreading that the Washington Redskins may be about to change its name. The wording used on the filing documents is similar to that used for the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. A spokesman for the Redkins denied the team were contemplating a name change. “There is no connection between the Washington Redskins and the trademark application,” said a team spokesman. “Dan Snyder does not know the man named in the story.” However, this appeared to be untrue.

He said that while fans get attached to the nicknames, nostalgia may not be a good enough reason to keep them in place. 'I don't want to detract from the wonderful Redskins fans that are here. They love their team and rightly so,' he said. But . the president appeared to come down on the side of those who have . sharply criticized the football team's name, noting that Indians 'feel . pretty strongly' about mascots and team names that depict negative . stereotypes about their heritage. Depictions: The Redskins players above are shown wearing helmets depicting the team's mascot - a Native American Indian . Sticking with it: Ten members of Congress sent a letter to the NFL commissioner last May, asking for the name to be changed.

Travelling in style: It is not known how much . the RAF helicopter would have cost - but it is likely to have run into . the tens of thousands. A similar train journey costs just £67 for standard class return ticket . It is believed that the flight by RAF helicopter was only a little more than an hour faster than taking a train. On Tuesday, Mr Cameron was driven to . RAF Northolt, near Uxbridge, West London, in his ministerial car, a . journey of around 35 minutes. He was then flown by military . helicopter to RAF Waddington, near Lincoln – a flight of less than an . hour – where he was met by another car to take the 13-minute journey to a . Siemens factory. A similar train journey from London to . Lincoln, changing at Newark North Gate, takes around two hours and . costs £67, or around £120 for a first-class ticket. It is not known how much using the RAF helicopter would have cost, but it is likely to have been several thousand pounds.

The shortest distance between any two points... This map compares the road and rail routes from . London to Lincoln with the 'as the crow flies' route the Prime Minister . chose to take in an RAF helicopter .

He said: ‘Today, I’ve been flying . around, but I use trains, cars, boats, planes, helicopters – all manner . of means. But I know here in Lincoln you want to see more direct . services. There’s the one but we need more.’ 'It's amazeballs': Former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott used his Twitter account to mock Mr Cameron's choice of transport . Natalie Bennett, the leader of the . Green Party, said: ‘Clearly, he should have taken a train for . environmental reasons. It’s an immense sum of money.’ Steve McCabe, Labour MP for Birmingham . Selly Oak, said: ‘People stuck on trains and in traffic queues in the . sweltering heat will be appalled to find out that David Cameron was . spending thousands of pounds of their money on a helicopter to ferry him . to a publicity stunt. 'Once again it just shows just how out of touch . the Tories are.’ Mr Cameron’s spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister will use the most appropriate form of travel.’ Asked why an RAF helicopter was deemed . to be the most appropriate mode of transport on this occasion, he . replied: ‘Because it was.

A premature baby died from multiple organ failure after being kissed by his doting father, his heartbroken mother has revealed. Kaiden McCormick's tiny body shut down after catching a cold sore virus from Carl Maclaren. He spent six weeks on a life-support machine, but doctors were unable to save him and he died aged just two months. Kiss of death: Baby Kaiden McCormick died after contracting a cold virus which he caught when he was given a loving kiss by his father Carl Maclaren (right), his mother Marrie-Claire McCormick (left) has revealed . 'His heart broke in two': Carl and Marrie-Claire were devastated to find out that their baby had been struck down by a virus from his father's kiss . His parents were shocked to discover their baby had been struck down with the herpes simplex virus, a disease carried by most of the population, but usually lies dormant. Mother Marrie-Claire McCormick, 28, said: 'I asked how it was possible for a baby to have herpes? 'When he said it was transmitted via . the cold sore virus I looked at Carl and he instinctively touched his . lip. In that moment I saw his heart break in two. 'Carl just broke down. He was totally distraught and kept saying he blamed himself. 'But I never once blamed Carl. All he . had ever done was shower our baby with love and affection. He had been . the perfect father. I hated seeing him punish himself.' 'Distraught': Carl feels that if he had never gone near his son 'he'd still be here today' Vulnerable: Kaiden was born five weeks premature on March 28 . Carl, 34, a painter and decorator from Bootle, Merseyside, said: 'I blame myself but I had no idea. 'Obviously if I had I wouldn't have gone near him and he'd still be here today.' Marrie-Claire was thrilled to discover she was expecting a son in August 2011. Kaiden was born five weeks prematurely on March 28 last year. Marrie-Claire said: ‘We were smitten with him. He looked the image of his daddy with a shock of dark hair and blue eyes. 'It was our dream come true to be home together as a family.’ They doted on Kaiden and each night after his . bath would spend time kissing and cuddling him before laying him down . to sleep in his moses basket next to their bed where Marrie-Claire would . sing him off to sleep. Heartbreaking: Kaiden spent six weeks on a life-support machine, but doctors were unable to save him . Campaigning: Marrie-Claire, pictured (left) with Kaiden in hospital and is expecting again (right), is calling on the government to raise more awareness of the dangers of cold sores for babies . Cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), which is carried by most people, but usually lies dormant. It can be caught through physical contact, such as kissing or even breastfeeding. While most adults carry the virus without any health risks, it can be fatal for babies because of their poor immunity. Those in the first six weeks of life are most at risk. While . the virus can be notoriously hard to detect, early signs include a baby . not feeding, drowsiness, fever, floppiness and unusual crying. The . Royal College of Midwives recommends that anyone with a cold sore or . symptoms of an impending outbreak should avoid kissing a baby as HSV is . most virulent when the skin is broken. But when he just over two weeks old, he sent his parents into blind panic when he suddenly turned blue after refusing to take his bottle. Marrie-Claire said: 'I wasn’t too worried at first, but when I tried again later he grizzled and moaned so I kept a close eye on him.’ She’d just noticed a slight temperature when suddenly Kaiden turned blue and stopped breathing. 'Pure panic hit, I just  screamed at Carl to call an ambulance,’ she says. Paramedics arrived within minutes and rushed the family to Alder Hay Hospital in Liverpool where Kaiden was taken straight into resuscitation. Marrie-Claire said: 'There were doctors everywhere all frantically working on him. I kept asking them what was wrong, what had happened to my baby? But nobody knew. 'When they took me to see him he was on a ventilator covered in tubes and wires and I just broke down. 'He looked so tiny. I couldn’t believe this had happened so quickly, he’d been fine the night before. I kept thinking it was an awful nightmare and that I’d wake up.’ The parents kept vigil at his bedside but just 48 hours later consultants warned he was unlikely to survive and urged them to consider switching of the ventilator. 'A consultant told us his brain was that swollen he was unlikely to pull through. I went into shock. It didn’t make sense that I’d given birth to a perfect baby and now I was being told to let him go before I even knew what was wrong with him.’ Desperate: Carl pleaded with doctors to do everything they could, but after six weeks on life-support Kaiden started to suffer seizures and his parents were gently asked to consider switching the machine off . Carl said: ' I pleaded with them to do something else, he was only two weeks old. We couldn’t give up.’ After six weeks in hospital Kaiden still couldn't breathe for himself and when he started suffering seizures Marrie-Claire and Carl were gently asked to consider having the machine switched off. She said: ‘ We were told there was no hope and as a mother you want to protect your baby from suffering so we made the hardest decision of our lives. 'We gave permission for the permission to be switched off so he could go to sleep. He was handed to me and I cuddled him and held him as he slipped away. 'I kissed him and told him how much I loved him and how good it felt to hold him in my arms again as he fell asleep for the last time.’ Kaiden was just eight weeks old when he slipped away on May 24th last year. The hospital was obliged to inform the police the illness was unexplained. But no charges were brought after the death was confirmed as a tragic accident. They wrote to the health secretary calling for more information to be given to expectant mums and started an e petition for hospitals to include facts about the virus on leaflets given to new parents. Now Marrie-Claire is eight months pregnant and due to give birth to a baby girl next month. She said: 'She is our reason to live again. But I will never get over losing my son Kaiden. 'He would have been a fantastic big brother if he hadn’t been taken by a kiss. No baby should ever die because of a kiss.'

A high school football player was suspended for four days and dropped from his team after he wrote a poem criticizing his teammates as part of a school assignment. Nick Andre penned the scathing verse  after being asked to write about something which made him angry. The 16-year-old student at Rittman High School in Ohio decided to make the Rittman Indians the subject of his poem after they won only once all season, losing their other seven fixtures. Suspended: Nick Andre, pictured, wrote the poem as a school assignment, but the junior football star's criticism was not welcome . But after he read the poem in class, the school's principal reacted furiously and suspended the teenager for 'harassment and hazing'. Nick, a defensive end on the team said: 'I felt it was my right to express what I just felt. An extract from the poem, entitled 'Stupid', reads: 'Losing season, favoritism, non-stop passes from best friend to best friend, continuously doing what doesn't work...dropped passes, but yet, still the superstar, yea right, where's my scholarship? I can drop passes, run backwards, miss tackles.' He read the controversial poem out in class, a move which angered the school's board of administrators. Principal Nick Evans reacted by issuing the harsh punishment and sending a letter to the boy's mother. 'Losing season, . favoritism. Non-stop passes from . best friend to best friend. Continuously doing . what doesn't work' - Extract from 'Stupid', by Nick Andre . In the note, Mr Evans wrote that Nick had, 'wrote a mean and disrespectful poem about another student and our Athletic Director/Head Coach. 'Nick will be suspended for four days and will be removed from the football team for the last two weeks of the season.' The student criticized the decision to remove him from classes, saying the punishment could really affect his grades. Nick's mother, Julie Andre refused to sign the suspension letter given to her by the principal, when they met on Monday. Speaking to fox8.com, Mrs Andre said: 'All he could refer to was bullying, he said that this poem was bullying. 'My comment was, ""why would the teacher . entertain this assignment because you know, you don’t know what you may . get from teenage kids"", so to me, I couldn’t understand (the ruling).' Offending poem: The piece was called 'Stupid' and aimed at his high school football teammates, who had only won one game all season . Out of the team: As well as being suspended Nick, pictured was dropped from the team, but a top attorney believes that the ruling may be a constitutional breach of human rights . The punishment was also criticized by a leading civil rights attorney, who said that by being punished for speaking his mind, Nick has had his rights have been infringed. Cleveland Avery Friedman, said: 'It's obviously protected speech under the first amendment. 'The breadth of expression, even in public schools, is virtually limitless, unless speech is creating material disruption to the educational process, which certainly isn’t here.' Rittman school district declined to comment. The 1971, first amendment to the Constitution of the United States, part of the Bill of Rights, reads: . 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.'","Nick Andre, 16, was asked to write about what made him angry for class .

The parents of a little girl who suffered more than 100 fits a day were repeatedly told there was wrong with her, they have claimed. Olivia Meredith, known as Livvy to her family, suffered from Rett Syndrome, a form of autism which leads to epileptic fits. But it took two years to get a diagnosis, with the toddler instead being diagnosed with a learning difficulty - and her fits being blamed on this. Olivia Meredith suffered from Rett Syndrome, a form of autism that leads to epileptic fits . Her mother Sara, 36, claims doctors said the seizures were quite common and accused her of 'being neurotic'. She said: 'Livvy went from being a happy healthy toddler, to one who couldn't speak, walk or talk.' It felt like it all happened overnight. 'She was just 22-months-old at the time and before that she suffered no other symptoms. Eventually she started to have seizures and on one occasion she had 100 fits in 24 hours. It was terrifying.' Mrs Meredith, a foster mother, and her husband Alan, 41, not only had to face caring for their sick daughter, they also had to battle with medics who refused to believe Livvy was seriously ill. Olivia (second left) with her sisters (from left to right) Brodie, Eden and Kennedy, days before she died in 2008 . Olivia's family are now fundraising to try and find a cure for the devastating condition. Her parents Sara and Alan say it took two years for their daughter to be diagnosed . 'She would just scream instead of . speaking,' recalled Mrs Meredith.  Doctors at the local Manor Hospital in Walsall  diagnosed her . with a learning disability. ‘But I knew this wasn't the case,' she said. She claims the . doctors continued to disregard the seizures of a sign of anything . serious, saying they were common in children with a learning disability. ‘One doctor accused me of being neurotic.’ Finally, at the age of four, Livvy was referred to a neurologist, who immediately diagnosed Rett Syndrome. ‘At the time there wasn't a great deal . of information about the illness, despite it being fairly common in . girls,’ said Mrs Meredith. ‘But we were told it was life-limiting and . Livvy had a severe form of the condition. Olivia's parents were told their daughter's fits - which sometimes totalled 100 a day - were due to her suffering a learning disability. They say they were accused by doctors of being 'neurotic' She continued: ‘It was a big shock. To have a healthy child who you are then told has a life threatening illness is devastating. ‘We complained but we didn't get an apology from The Manor Hospital for not diagnosing it. It was down to knowledge - they hadn't come across it before. If we went there now - they would spot it.' Livvy died in 2008 aged nine after contracting a virus. Mrs Meredith is now crusading to raise awareness of the condition and fundraising to find a cure. 'Now I am determined to raise awareness of the condition and money for the Rett Syndrome Trust UK, which is looking at finding a cure. 'I hope that no one will ever have to suffer the way we did with Livvy. It is soul destroying and the only reason Alan and I have managed to move forward is because we have three beautiful girls and our faith.'

But this video appears to show Buddhist monks enjoying a very different lifestyle - wearing stylish aviators glasses while listening to wireless headphones on a private jet. The monks from Thailand are now under investigation following numerous complaints from Buddhists around the world after the two minute and 47 second long clip was posted on Youtube. Scroll down to watch video . Jet-setting monks: Buddhists around the world have complained after video footage showing two Thai monks wearing aviator-style glasses on a private jet was posted on Youtube . Expensive: The monks also appeared to have designer bags on board the plane and be using high-tech gadgets . The Office of National Buddhism director-general Nopparat Benjawatananun said that the agency saw the video and had warned the monks from a monastery in Thailand's north-east not to repeat the lavish behaviour. It plans to monitor monks nationwide. With the world's largest Buddhist population, Thailand has attempted to help Buddha's 2,600-year-old doctrine stand the test of time through a variety of means, including imposing a ban on the sale of alcohol on religious holidays. The efforts, however, are sometimes tainted by the monks themselves. Last year, about 300 out of 61,416 Buddhist monks and novices in Thailand were reprimanded - in several cases removed from the monkhood - because of their misconduct, ranging from alcohol consumption, having sex with women, to extortion. The office also received complaints about monks driving cars, and scams and false claims of black magic uses by monks. Spotlight: The Office of National Buddhism is now investigating the incident after complaints about the video, pictured, from around the world . Tainted: Approximately 300 of the 61,416 monks in Thailand were reprimanded for misconduct over their behaviour last year . Mr Nopparat said the Buddhist monks in the video were acting 'inappropriately, not composed and not adhering to Buddha's teachings of simplicity and self-restraint'. Monruedee Bantoengsuk, an administrative officer at Khantitham Temple in Sisaket province, confirmed that the monks on the private plane lived at the temple but refused to give details about the trip. 'We can explain this, but not now,' she said, saying that the abbot, who appeared in the video, is currently on a religious tour in France. The images from the video contrasted with the abbot's message on the temple's homepage that read: 'The true core of those who preach Buddha's teachings is to not to own any objects at all. Warning: The monks, from the Khantitham Temple in Sisaket province in Thailand, have been warned not to repeat their lavish behaviour displayed in the video . Keeping it simple: Khantitham Temple in Sisaket province says on its website that while monks need to keep abreast of what is going on in the world, they need to use the appropriate tools, and do not require luxuries . 'When Lord Buddha was alive, there wasn't anything like this. There were no cars, smart phones or cameras, so the rules were much simpler,' said Mr Nopparat. 'While the monks need to keep themselves abreast of new knowledge, current events and technology, they are restrained to choose the appropriate tools.' He said one way to prevent the monks from misbehaving is for followers not to spoil them with valuable objects or vices. 'In many cases, it was the followers who gave the monks the luxury. Some bought them sports cars. This is by no means necessary.'","The monks from Thailand can be seen using wireless headphones in video .

A handwritten copy of a manifesto dubbed the 'diary of death', which was put together by White Widow Samantha Lewthwaite, reveals a terrifying code of conduct for her 'holy warriors'. Lewthwaite, 29, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire – the world’s most wanted woman – has been on the run since December 2011 after being linked to a plan to bomb luxury tourist resorts in the Kenyan coastal resort of Mombasa. The daughter of a British soldier has also been linked to last month’s horrific terror attack on a Nairobi shopping mall, which killed more than 70 people. Scroll down for video . Doting mother: Lewthwaite poses with her two sons Abdullah and Abdur-Rahman. The eldest, Abdullah, is the son of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay . The mother-of-four is subject of an international manhunt by nearly 200 countries after she was named in a Red Alert by Interpol following the atrocity in Nairobi, which was carried out by gunmen linked to the Al Shabaab terror group. A copy of her manifesto transcribed into English by one her recruits reveals her plans to wage war on westerners. The five-pages of notes were found among belongings of bomb-maker Hassan Omondi in a safe house used by Al Shabaab terrorists in Mombasa, Kenya. In the book, the young recruit writes: 'Element of surprise - You need this to get victory. 'Surprising the enemy is half of the war. This surprise is a result of proper intelligence.' Samantha Lewthwaite penned a 34-line poem to Osama bin Laden and promised to continue his fight . The code of conduct highlights seven qualities every soldier must have. They are loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honour, integrity and courage.' Bizarrely, another section encourages her disciples to treat others with dignity and respect. It also advises that any work carried out must be based on strong intelligence otherwise it will fail. 'Like a building, if the foundations are not strong and you want to build on it you will bring it down,' it reads. The manual is believed to have been transcribed by a man called Ormondi Budalangi, also known as Zain. Lewthwaite met Ormondi at a mosque in Mombasa and put him forward for special training. However, he was killed during a police raid in Mombasa in October 2012. The mother-of-four is subject of an international manhunt by nearly 200 countries after being named by Interpol . A security source told The Mirror: 'The manifesto is a book of death and destruction. The security community is working day and night to find Lewthwaite and bring a stop to her evil empire.' Yesterday pictures emerged of Lewthwaite that showed a double life of the British Muslim convert - as both a loving mother and an Islamic terrorist plotting atrocities against Western targets. The family pictures, taken in July 2010, and discovered by British anti-terrorist investigators on a discarded computer in Kenya, reveal Lewthwaite’s softer side, but locked in the hard-drive of the laptop aofficers made more chilling discoveries. They found Lewthwaite had spent eight years researching bomb-making and searching for the deadly chemicals used to make improvised explosives devices. Samantha Lewthwaite wrote that she is preparing her children, pictured, for a life of terror . Items: Police found a language card, a religious text, a photograph of her children and a fake vaccination card when they searched one of the houses where Lewthwaite had stayed . And they discovered a poem she wrote, praising the ideology of Al Qaeda mastermind Osama Bin Laden, who was killed in Pakistan by US troops in May 2011. Typed clumsily after his death, Lewthwaite proclaims her love for the terrorist chief. She wrote: ‘Oh Sheik Osama my father, my brother / My love for you is like no other / Oh Sheik Osama now that you are gone / The Muslims must wake up they must be strong.’ A diary found in one of Samantha Lewthwaite's houses in Mombasa, before she fled in December 2011 . The family photos were taken while . Lewthwaite was living in South African, working in a halal pie factory . under the false name of Natalie Faye Webb. She . is believed to have moved to Kenya in 2007, just months after she . condemned the deadly role her husband Lindsay played in the 7/7 London . bombings that killed 52. She . moved to South Africa in 2008 and adopted the identity of an . unsuspecting young woman who had moved to the UK with her parents as a . baby. The Briton later fled the country, through Tanzania, establishing a base in Mombasa, Kenya, where she is believed to have become a senior figure in Al Shabaab. Lewthwaite went into hiding in December 2011 after she convinced anti-terror police to let her go when she was arrested following a raid on an Al Shabaab cell. Her British accomplice Jermaine Grant, from London, is on trial in Kenya for terrorist offences. Safe house: Police found a diary, along with ammunition and smashed computers, at this property in Mombasa . Her second husband Habib Ghani  28, from Hounslow, Middlesex, was killed in a gun battle in Somalia last month after falling out with senior Al Shabaab members. He had called himself Osama al-Britani. Lewthwaite is known to her followers as dada mzungu – Swahili for white sister. It is claimed she has become the ‘trainer’ of an all-female suicide bomber squad targeting Westerners in East Africa. Her appointment was announced on a website sympathetic to Al Shabaab, which revealed that Lewthwaite ‘gave her life to Allah and now she serves Allah as his female soldier in [Somalia]’, where she ‘commands her all-female mujahid terror squad and conducts operations against the kuffar [non-Muslims]’. Hideaway: Lewthwaite is believed to have lived here while writing her diary . Earlier this year Lewthwaite broke cover with a Twitter rant at a fellow fanatic. She called fugitive Omar Hammadi, who has since been killed, ‘an irritating prat’. It stemmed from a feud involving US-born Hammadi and former allies in the Al Shabaab network. Hammadi dismissed Lewthwaite as merely ‘a girl in Kenya’. Lewthwaite hit back: ‘Yes, am a girl in Kenya like dat makes a difference u misogynist!’ And in a reference to Mujahideen holy war fanatics, she added: ‘Fyi sam lewthwaite thinks u r a irritating obnoxious contemptible little Muj PRAT.’ In the wake of 7/7, Lewthwaite portrayed herself as another victim of the tragedy, describing the attack as ‘abhorrent’. Several attackers from the Somali militant group al-Shabab stormed a Nairobi mall, which Lewthwaite has been linked to . She claimed to have had no knowledge of the plans and dreaded the day she would have to tell her children ‘what their father did’. But earlier this month, the Daily Mail revealed a manifesto for terrorism that Lewthwaite wrote, describing her need to murder disbelievers and inciting others – including her children – to do the same. The nine-page document revealed how she was grooming her four children to follow in the footsteps of Lindsay. She wrote how she was ‘blessed’ to have had a holy warrior husband and of how she had sacrificed her comfortable Western life to fight non-Muslims. She said: ‘Allah blessed me with the best husband for me. In fact, exactly what I asked for . . . before marriage.’ Lewthwaite is thought to be in hiding in Tanzania or Somalia.","Samantha Lewthwaite is dubbed the world’s most wanted woman .

Mr Alladin, an international student and son of an Indian millionaire, called an ambulance as he suddenly collapsed. Tragic Sarmad Alladin, 18, nicknamed 'Mr Muscles', posted this picture of himself on Facebook . He was living in university accommodation in Epsom, Surrey, while attending the specialist art and design university in nearby Farnham. A friend told The Sun: 'He wasn't the . type to put something like that into his body, so clearly they're . misleading. I've cried so much since he died.' Last week the University for the Creative Arts warned its students: 'It has come to the University's attention that some very dangerous weight-loss and body-building drugs could be circulating among students. 'If you have bought or obtained Dinitrophenol or Dymetadrine tablets online or anywhere else, please stop using them immediately. The drugs are potentially lethal.' Vice-chancellor Dr Simon Ofield-Kerr said: 'As a university we are devastated by the untimely and tragic passing of one of our students, Sarmad Alladin. Our sympathies are with his family and friends at this difficult time.' Last night Mr Alladin's  family, who flew to UK from Hyderabad, were awaiting the results of a post mortem. The drug DNP is sold mostly over the internet under a number of different names but contains 2, 4-Dinitrophenol . A spokesman for Surrey Police said: ''Surrey Police received reports of the sudden death of an 18-year-old man at Epsom General Hospital on Wednesday, February 13. 'The man, who is from Epsom, was brought into the hospital around 4am and was pronounced dead at 6.20am. 'Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident.

DNP is sold mostly over the internet under a number of different names but contains 2, 4-Dinitrophenol. It is marketed mainly to bodybuilders as a weight loss aid as it is thought to dramatically boost metabolism.

Selena Walrond, 26, (left) died from a heart . attack in 2008 after taking a large amount of DNP (right) that she had . bought online . The manufactured drug is yellow and odourless and was previously used as a herbicide and fungicide. It was launched as a slimming aid in the U.S. in the 1930s but then banned in 1938, due to the severe side-effects. According to a study published last year in the Journal of Medical Toxicity, in medical literature has attributed 62 deaths to DNP.

His estate is reportedly worth £4.3million . The estate of Jimmy Savile has been frozen in response to the mounting sexual abuse claims against the late television and radio star. NatWest Bank, which is acting as the Jim'll Fix It presenter's will executor and trustee, said the distribution of his assets had been put on hold because of the allegations. Savile's estate is reportedly worth £4.3 million. NatWest said in a statement: 'Given the claims raised, distribution of the estate has been put on hold.' Savile's . will was written in 2006 and bequeaths his savings and other assets to . 26 separate beneficiaries, according to the Financial Times (FT). The . newspaper said it had obtained a copy of the document which instructs . that £20,000 in cash was to be shared between 20 of the celebrity's . friends, family and neighbours. It says a further £600,000 was to be put into a trust fund, with the interest shared between eight people. The . remainder - just under £3.7 million before expenses - was to be held by . NatWest on behalf of The Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust, according to . the FT. Savile's intended individual beneficiaries include the trustees of both his charities and existing and former employees of Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor Hospital, the newspaper added. Police are investigating claims that the star, who died in October last year, sexually assaulted individuals at both NHS sites. Volunteer: Sir Jimmy Savile did shifts as a porter at the Leeds General Infirmary from 1968 (pictured) Money: Leeds General Infirmary, pictured above, is one of the beneficiaries of Savile's will . Savile's estate was previously put on hold in July after a woman claimed to be his illegitimate daughter, the FT said. It is believed the latest freeze may be in anticipation of legal claims for damages by Savile's alleged victims. A solicitor representing the alleged victims welcomed NatWest's decision. Alan Collins from law firm Pannone said, 'This is good news for those victims of Savile who are taking legal action, as it means that they will be able to pursue claims against the estate. Savile is now believed to have been one of the UK's most prolific abusers, with about 300 possible victims . 'If NatWest had not put the estate on . hold, it would have meant legal action against Savile's estate to . prevent the assets from being distributed amongst the beneficiaries of . his will.' He added: 'Pannone are also actively . pursuing inquiries into Savile's overseas assets, which we believe are . being administered in Guernsey.' Scotland Yard is leading a national investigation into the television and radio star's activities. He is now believed to have been one of the UK's most prolific abusers, with about 300 possible victims. Detectives are following 400 lines of inquiry as part of the investigation while the BBC has launched an inquiry into the culture and practices at the corporation in the era of Savile's alleged sexual abuse.

An anti-porn group has demanded the Pentagon take dirty magazines off the shelves at military bases because they are ‘sexually exploitative’. The Morality in Media organisation, which runs the website, Porn Harms, says military wives have complained to them that the easy access to porn at bases is breaking up their marriages. It is also linking Playboys and other explicit magazines with sexual assault issues in the military. Dirty magazines might soon be pulled off shelves at military bases . Navy Exchange Store: Porn magazines are illegally sold in Nex stores on base . 'Pornography is sexually exploitative, the military has a sexual exploitation problem, and this is contributing to that,' deputy executive director for Morality in Media, Casey Capozzoli, tells News Channel 3. The group is going after the Pentagon for selling dirty magazines to sailors, soldiers, marines and airmen in base exchanges around the world. 'Men are coming back from deployments addicted to pornography ...It’s almost like your husband is cheating on you,’ Capozzoli says. Selling sexually explicit material on base is against the law, according to the Military Honor and Decency Act, which was passed in 1996. Porn harms: The website run by Morality in Media says military's porn problem is linked to sexual assault . Morality in Media's Casey Capozzoli says military men come home from deployment 'addicted' to porn . The Morality in Media group was not successful when it first tried to petition Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. But when they approached Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, right before an Armed Services Committee hearing, their plea was heard. ‘These are pictures given to me of magazines being sold at an Air Force Exchange, our culture is awash in sexual activity,’ said Senator Sessions at the hearing. That picture of rows of dirty magazines was snapped at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, where more than 40 instructors have been accused – most of them convicted - of having inappropriate sexual relations with female basic trainees. The committee’s ensuing report for the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill 2014, released in June, directs military officials to start the process of pulling the magazines off the shelves. Not everyone agrees with the move, however. ‘With people losing jobs … this is the most important thing they could come up with? It’s foolish, we have a lot of other stuff we need to worry about, instead of dirty magazines and selling them on base,’ a Department of Defense civilian worker tells News Channel 3. The Pentagon has 180 days to start reviewing the policy in the Appropriations Bill as per the Senate's instructions.","Armed Services Committee tells military officials to get rid of porn .

Traces of extraterrestrial life are most likely to be first detected on planets orbiting dying stars, according to new research. A theoretical study of Earth-like planets orbiting white dwarf stars found we could detect oxygen in the atmosphere of one much more easily than on those orbiting a star like our own Sun. Large quantities of oxygen in the atmosphere of a distant planet would signal the likely presence of life there. This is based on the fact that if all life on Earth was to die out, our atmosphere would become devoid of oxygen, as it relies on plant life to replenish the supply through photosynthesis. Scroll down for video . Orbiting a dying star: This artist's impression shows how an Earth-like planet orbiting a white dwarf star might look. New research claims signs of life would be easier to detect on such planets using space telescopes . 'In the quest for extraterrestrial . biological signatures, the first stars we study should be white dwarfs,' said Avi Loeb, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics . (CfA). When a star like the Sun dies, it sloughs off its outer layers, leaving behind a hot core called a white dwarf. Typically about the size of Earth, a white dwarf slowly cools and fades over time, but it can retain heat long enough to warm a nearby world for billions of years. Since a white dwarf is much smaller and fainter than the Sun, a planet would have to be much closer in to be habitable with liquid water on its surface. Such a planet would circle the white dwarf once every 10 hours at a distance of about a million miles. Before a star becomes a white dwarf it swells into a red giant, engulfing and destroying any nearby planets. So a planet would have to arrive in the habitable zone after the star evolved into a white dwarf. It could form from leftover dust and gas (making it a second-generation world), or migrate inward from a larger distance, researchers say. Previous research has suggested that the abundance of heavy elements on the surface of white dwarfs indicates that a significant fraction of them have rocky planets. Professor Loeb and his colleague Dan Maoz, professor of physics and astronomy at Tel Aviv University, estimate that a survey of the 500 closest white dwarfs could spot one or more habitable planets. Last hurrah: This Hubble Space Telescope image shows a star as it casts off its outer layers of gas, which formed a cocoon around the core. The white dwarf star which remains appears as a white dot in the centre . The best method for finding such . planets is, they say, a transit search - looking for a star that dims as . an orbiting planet crosses in front of it. Since . a white dwarf is about the same size as Earth, an Earth-sized planet . would block a large fraction of its light and create an obvious signal. More importantly, we can only study the atmospheres of transiting planets. The James Webb Space Telescope (sometimes called JWST) is a large, infrared-optimised space telescope due to be launched in 2018. With a large 21.3ft diameter mirror and a sunshield the size of a tennis court, the new space telescope is set to succeed Hubble as the foremost deep space observatory. It will float in an orbit one million miles from Earth. Nasa said: 'Webb will be the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide. 'It will study every phase in the history of our Universe, ranging from the first luminous glows after the Big Bang, to the formation of solar systems capable of supporting life on planets like Earth, to the evolution of our own Solar System.' Several innovative technologies have been developed for Webb. These include a folding, segmented primary mirror, adjusted to shape after launch; ultra-lightweight beryllium optics; detectors able to record extremely weak signals, microshutters that enable programmable object selection for the spectrograph; and a cryocooler for cooling the mid-IR detectors to 7K. There will be four science instruments on Webb: the Near InfraRed Camera (NIRCam), the Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec), the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI), and the Fine Guidance Sensor/ Near InfraRed Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (FGS-NIRISS). Webb's instruments will be designed to work primarily in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum, with some capability in the visible range. It will be sensitive to light from 0.6 to 28 micrometers in wavelength. The new space telescope is an international collaboration between Nasa, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), with the project managed from Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Centre. When the white dwarf's light shines . through the ring of air that surrounds the planet's silhouetted disk, . the atmosphere absorbs some starlight. This leaves chemical fingerprints showing whether that air contains water vapour, or even signatures of life, such as oxygen. Astronomers are particularly . interested in finding oxygen because the oxygen in the Earth's . atmosphere is continuously replenished, through photosynthesis, by plant . life. Were all life to cease on Earth, our . atmosphere would quickly become devoid of oxygen, which would dissolve . in the oceans and oxidise the surface. Thus, the presence of large quantities . of oxygen in the atmosphere of a distant planet would signal the likely . presence of life there. It is hoped that Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled for launch by the end of this decade, will have the ability to sniff out the gases of these alien worlds. Professors Loeb and Maoz created a synthetic spectrum, replicating what space telescope would see if it examined a habitable planet orbiting a white dwarf. They found that both oxygen and water vapour would be detectable with only a few hours of total observation time. 'JWST offers the best hope of finding an inhabited planet in the near future,' said Professor Maoz. Recent research by CfA astronomers Courtney Dressing and David Charbonneau showed that the closest habitable planet is likely to orbit a red dwarf star (a cool, low-mass star undergoing nuclear fusion). Since a red dwarf, although smaller and fainter than the Sun, is much larger and brighter than a white dwarf, its glare would overwhelm the faint signal from an orbiting planet's atmosphere. Even an instrument as sophisticated as the James Webb Space Telescope would have to observe hundreds of hours of transits to have any hope of analyzing the atmosphere's composition. 'Although the closest habitable planet might orbit a red dwarf star, the closest one we can easily prove to be life-bearing might orbit a white dwarf,' said Professor Loeb.","Chemical 'fingerprints' of oxygen easier to detect on such worlds .

Students are abusing 'smart drugs' typically used to treat hyperactivity disorders to help them concentrate and fight fatigue. Prescriptions for methylphenidate drugs, including Ritalin, have been steadily increasing, according to the Care Quality Commission’s (CQC) annual report on controlled drugs. The drugs are one of a number linked to the 'smart-drug' craze - where students take medication to fight fatigue and help them concentrate. Worried students are taking the medication to fight fatigue and help them concentrate. Previous research has indicated that as many as one in 10 UK students could be taking 'cognitive enhancing' drugs. The number of drugs dished out to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder sufferers has soared by more than 50 per cent in six years, figures show. In 2007, GPs in England wrote 420,000 prescriptions for such medication, but by 2012 the figure had leapt to 657,000 - a rise of 56 per cent. Watchdogs warned that health workers should 'carefully monitor' the drugs because they have a potential for 'diversion or misuse' Officials at the watchdog said health workers should 'carefully monitor' the drugs because they have a potential for 'diversion or misuse'. Methylphenidate is known as a psychostimulant. While it is not completely clear how it works, it is thought to stimulate a part of the brain that changes mental and behavioural reactions. The CQC report says the number of prescriptions for such medications rose by 11 per cent between 2011 and 2012. 'As in previous years, we believe that this reflects increased diagnosis of, and prescribing for, the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),' the CQC report states. 'We are also aware of the possibility that methylphenidate could be diverted and abused, and for this reason we recommend that its use should be monitored carefully. 'We are aware of reports in the media and scientific literature that it is being abused as a ‘smart’ drug to improve cognitive function; the long-term risks of this practice are not known.' Common symptoms of ADHD include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. Symptoms tend to be first noticed at an early age and it is normally diagnosed between the ages of three and seven. It is estimated the condition affects 2 per cent to 5 per cent of school-aged children and young people. However, it can be a lifelong condition and many children continue to show symptoms as a teenager and adult.","Prescriptions for methylphenidate drugs, including Ritalin, have increased .

A second possible new British case of rabies is being investigated after a man sought hospital treatment for a dog bite he received on holiday, experts confirmed today. The Health Protection Agency said a second person was being tested for the disease, two days after it confirmed a case of the potentially fatal illness in a 50-year-old woman who had been bitten by a dog in South Asia. The woman, believed to be a grandmother in her 50s, was reportedly turned away twice by doctors at Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford, Kent, before she was finally diagnosed. The hospital has launched an investigation. Investigation: Five members of staff at Darent Valley Hospital have been vaccinated after coming into contact with the woman . The new patient, a male from Leeds, sought medical attention after being bitten while abroad, although the HPA would not say where he had been or provide any further details about his identity. A spokesperson said: 'There is another person being looked at. 'This isn't unusual that people bitten by dogs in Rabies endemic areas go for further investigation when they return. 'There are eight people this year who have been through this process.' Rabies is usually transferred through saliva from the bite of an infected animal, with dogs being the most common transmitter of rabies to humans. More than 55,000 people are estimated to die from the disease every year, with most cases occurring in developing countries, particularly South and South-East Asia. Specialist treatment: The patient is in an isolation room at University College Hospital, London (above) after developing symptoms within the last fortnight . The woman with rabies is now being treated at London's Hospital for Tropical Diseases, which has reassured patients, visitors and staff there is no risk to them as a result of the case. Yesterday it was reported she had initially been sent home three times after going to a GP and A&E complaining of sickness. Each time she was sent home because doctors believed her symptoms were ‘vague’. Now hospital staff claim the diagnosis was hampered because she failed to mention her trip or the dog bite. Had she done so ‘alarm bells would have rung immediately’, staff said. Deadly: The grandmother's illness is the first case of rabies in England in almost seven years. The last occurred in July 2005 when a woman died after contracting it from a dog bite during a holiday in the Indian resort of Goa, pictured . Rare: Naturalist David McRae (pictured) became the first person in Britain to die of the disease for 100 years after he was bitten on the hand by a rabid bat in 2002 . The victim, who lives in London, is being treated in an isolation unit at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases at University College Hospital, London. The Health Protection Agency has insisted members of the public are not at risk. Twenty people who have been in contact with the patient, including relatives, a GP and hospital staff have been offered vaccines as a precaution. The woman first visited her GP ten days ago complaining of sickness. Two days later she went to the A&E unit at Darent Valley hospital in Dartford, Kent, only to be sent home. She returned the next day but the hospital refused to admit her believing she was suffering from a mild illness. Killer: Rabies viruses showing their characteristic bullet shape. The disease has an extremely low survival rate once symptoms have developed . Vaccination programme: Although all but eradicated in the UK rabies is still common in developing countries . A source at the hospital said: ‘Had the staff been properly informed about this woman’s trip to India, and especially that she had been bitten by a dog there, alarm bells would have rung immediately and the whole approach to her treatment would have been totally different to what happened.’ It was only when she visited her GP again last Friday – four days after the first appointment – rabies was suspected. Hospital staff have admitted she is unlikely to survive. But even if she had been diagnosed sooner it is unlikely her chances of recovery would have been any higher. Once the symptoms of rabies develop – including sickness, aggression and hallucinations – the virus has spread to the brain and is nearly always fatal. Professor Tom Solomon, of the Institute of Infection and Global Health at the University of Liverpool, said the mortality rate is ‘almost 100 per cent’. ‘Almost everyone who gets bitten but doesn’t seek help will die within a few weeks of the symptoms starting to show,’ he said. Although no one has caught rabies in this country since the early 1900s, several have become infected while travelling abroad. The last case in England was in 2005 when a Manchester woman died after contracting the virus from a dog bite in Goa, India. Lethal: There are about 55,000 cases of rabies worldwide each year. Half of all rabies cases occur in India, the Taj Mahal is pictured . Rabies is a viral infection which targets the nervous system and the brain. It is only spread by infected animals to humans, most often through the animal biting or scratching the person. It can also be spread by an animal's saliva being in contact with a graze or cut on a human's skin. The majority of rabies cases result from being bitten by an infected dog. The symptoms of the illness include high temperatures, numbness at the area where the bite occurred and hallucinations. Some victims also have hydrophobia, which is a fear of water. There are about 55,000 cases of rabies worldwide each year with most cases occurring in Africa and Asia. But half of all rabies cases occur in India. The grandmother's illness is the first case of rabies in England in almost seven years. The last occurred in July 2005 when a woman from Manchester died after contracting it from a dog bite during a holiday in the Indian resort of Goa. Most cases of rabies in the UK occur from people infected abroad or from quarantined animals. Since 1946, 24 people have died who have been infected with rabies abroad. A total of four of these have occurred since 2000. In 2003, it was discovered that UK bats may be carrying a rabies-like virus. A bat handler died after contracting the virus in Scotland.","Male patient from Leeds being tested after seeking medical help .

Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker has said he could earn more if he left the BBC . Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker has said he could earn more money if he left the BBC. The former England striker said he was unable to justify his wage to 'ordinary people doing proper jobs' and said he was open to criticism because his wage came from the licence fee. The BBC is believed to pay Lineker £1.5m a year, according to reports, although he has previously said it is not as high as has been reported. In an interview with The Times, Lineker, who played for Leicester City, Everton, Barcelona and Spurs, described estimates of his overall wealth as 'completely ridiculous'. He said facing suggestions he earned too much money was the 'downside' of his role at the corporation. He said: 'I could earn more elsewhere, but because it's the licence fee you are open to criticism.' He went on to say: 'Do I deserve it? Probably not - but who would turn it down?' According to The Telegraph, Lineker's wage has never been publicly disclosed, but reports this year suggested he faced a cut of £500,000. The former footballer was previously believed to be on a salary of £2million a year. Lineker also holds a contract with Arabic TV network Al Jazeera — for whom he presents the station's Champions League coverage — and has a long-running deal with Walkers crisps. Lineker has recently featured in the programme Who Do You Think You Are? which saw him learn about two of his distant relatives, law writer Tom Billingham and 'poacher' James Pratt. The programme saw the presenter discover his great, great, great grandfather Mr Pratt was jailed in the 1800s for poaching birds to feed his eight children. The former England footballer said facing suggestions he earned too much was the 'downside' of his current role . Mr Pratt served his time in jail in Leicester which included six months for stealing chickens. Last month David Cameron warned huge pay-offs to senior bosses had jeopardised public support for the BBC. Annual accounts released in July revealed the corporation handed its top directors £4.1million in 12 months. The cost of the executive board rose by 63 per cent, boosted by golden goodbyes of nearly £1.5million. The Prime Minister said: ‘The BBC has to be very careful with the money that it spends. The BBC is in a unique position because it has the licence fee. ‘I support the licence fee but going with the licence fee is the responsibility to spend that money wisely and I think it’s quite clear the BBC pay-offs have been too high and there hasn’t been enough rigour in this whole process. ‘The BBC has strong public support but they won’t keep that support unless they spend the money wisely.’ Lineker is believed to earn about £1.5m a year from the BBC although he has previously said his salary is not as high as people say .","Gary Lineker says suggestions he earns too much was 'downside' of his job .

More than 1,200 activists had brought exploratory shale gas drilling to a halt on the edge of the village of Balcombe, West Sussex, at the weekend. But after officers from more than 10 police forces pushed back campaigners from the site’s entrance allowing lorries to enter on Monday, they left in their droves.

Before leaving the site activists staged a protest and tried to block the road as a lorry arrived at the Cuadrilla site . A ‘Reclaim the Power’ camp that had been illegally set up in a farmer’s field two miles away was completely dismantled this afternoon. Despite tents being camped out on the grass verges, traffic was not stopped and the country road was kept open by the police. Some people who had set up camping areas on footpaths around the drill were evicted by police officers without a fuss. Their only resistance was walking slowly in front of a lorry while chanting. One of the few remaining protesters is Natalie Hynde, daughter of Pretenders singer Chrissie and the Kinks frontman Ray Davies, who was returned after being arrested at the site for a public disorder offence last week.

This led to accusations the police had given into mob rule and were not enforcing the rule of law. Cuadrilla hopes to carry out exploratory drilling to assess if it is worth applying for a licence to extract shale gas that might involve fracking. The overall police operation against the protesters is expected to cost taxpayers more than £2million as it goes into its third week.

According to the latest research, the thought of stepping on the scales after the Christmas splurge is feared more by women than being dumped. Almost a third claim that it’s their greatest fear in January whereas only 12 per cent dread a relationship break-up. Weighing in: Women would rather get dumped in January than weight themselves . Only a trip to the dentist had the greater fear factor with 32 per cent claiming this to be the thing they dread the most. Having a colleague see them naked (19.5 per cent), checking their bank balance after a shopping splurge (19 per cent) and taking a driving test (9 per cent) are all feared less than the weigh in by UK women. Women’s aversion to a weigh-in post Christmas leaves most postponing the first step on the scales until 8th January, a whole two weeks after Christmas day, with a fifth daring not to step on the scales until then. Fear factor: Getting dumped came in sixth place, with only a trip to the dentist having the greater fear factor than being weighed . Despite the fact that 26 per cent of women do not put as much weight over the festive period as they expect to, a massive 40 per cent refuse to get weighed after Christmas at all. The study also revealed 18 per cent of UK adults would lie to their friends and family if they’d broken their New Year’s resolution. Men are deemed to be the sneakier sex as 20 per cent would try and convince their friends that they’d stuck to their resolution when they hadn’t, compared to a smaller 17 per cent of women. A further 20 per cent said that they’d feel smug if they kept up their resolution longer than their friends. Laura Graham from Onken, who carried out the research, said: 'We need to let our hair down this January and not let the pressure of resolutions get to us. 'With more women fearing stepping on the scales this New Year than being dumped, it goes to show that the pressure of facing their New Year’s demons is getting to the nation more than ever!'

A giant explosive cloud hanging over a North Sea rig could take six months to clear and may expand towards the Scottish coast, it was warned today. The huge underwater reservoir tapped by oil giant Total's Elgin platform, which sits 150 miles from Aberdeen, is known as the 'well from hell' because it is so difficult to plug. An exclusion zone stretching up to four miles has been set up around the platform because it could explode. The exact source of the leak is still a mystery but it is escaping out of the platform, which has pumped gas and oil to Britain for the past decade. Total say they are . considering a drilling relief well to divert the gas, which would be a safe way to end the crisis, but it could . take up to six months. The faster and riskier alternative of . sending engineers onto the rig to 'kill' the leak is also on the table, but it would mean having workers at the centre of a potential disaster zone. Danger: A leak from the Elgin rig, pictured, has led to more than 300 workers being evacuated from that and surrounding oil and gas platforms . Total boss David Hainsworth said: 'The well itself could die on its own. This is the dream option. 'There are two options for intervening. One is drilling a relief well which could take about six months. The other is a platform intervention to kill the well.' In the last two days hundreds of . workers have also been evacuated off or away from the Elgin Total . platform, which stands 150 miles from the Aberdeen coast. Coastguards . have today demanded shipping stays at least two miles away, planes must . keep a distance of three miles, while rigs up to four miles away are . being emptied in case they get caught up in any explosion. 'This is the well from hell,' said Frederic Hauge, head of Bellona, a leading Norwegian group that . closely monitors the oil industry. 'This problem is out of control and is only going to get bigger and bigger,' he added, saying the high pressure of the undersea reservoirs in the North Sea field made it especially hard to shut off. It is also being reported the team of . Texan 'Hellfighters' who battled the Deepwater Horizon disaster in . April 2010, which killed 11 and injured 16, is being brought to Scotland . by Total to prevent or tackle a blast. The . incident in the Gulf of Mexico . shocked the world and cost oil giant BP almost £5 billion in . reparations, and anything on that scale would be unprecedented in . Britain. Fears have risen because the Total rig is now . surrounded by a giant gas cloud, with a sheen of liquid gas on the water . - a tell-tale sign there is a large leak. Total's shares dived about five percent today as it scrambled to present a strategy to deal with the leak. David Hainsworth, health, safety and environment manager for the company, told the Good Morning Scotland programme that there are risks around the situation. He said: 'The gas is flammable but the platform power was turned off to minimise risk of ignition, but clearly there is a risk. 'We have taken away a series of risks but there is always a possibility, it's low but you never say never. 'The best-case scenario is that the gas in this area is not very productive and it dies off in the coming days and weeks. 'At the moment there is no real evolution of the sheen on the sea but if that was to change - and it's monitored on a daily basis - then the exclusion zone may be increased, but at the moment it will probably stay the same.' British officials said the gas, containing poisonous hydrogen sulphide - familiar from the smell of rotten eggs - should disperse in the atmosphere. But it poses a risk to anyone close to the source, making capping the well complex. Poison in the gas could also threaten fish and other marine life nearby, although the rate at which it dissipates in air and water meant it was not a significant threat to people on land. On Sunday all 238 staff were evacuated from the Elgin platform. Shell has now removed 85 workers from its Shearwater platform and the nearby Noble Hans Deul drilling rig while the nearby leak is found and stopped, taking the total evacuated from the area to 323. Drilling operations on its Noble Hans Deul rig have been suspended and the wells have been left in a safe state, Shell said. Close-up: It is being reported that the Total rig, pictured, has a large gas cloud surrounding it and has left a condensed gas slick on the water . 'While the move is purely precautionary and primarily driven by the prevailing weather conditions, and both facilities remain operational, it has been decided to reduce numbers to a more manageable level until the full situation surrounding the Elgin leak has been established,' a Shell spokesman added. They are removing 52 workers from Shearwater, leaving 38 on board, while 33 are being taken off the Hans Deul, leaving 79. Evidence of the leak is believed to have emerged a few hours after staff had completed the closure of a well on Sunday. But pressure began building up in the outer layers of the well, which led to bubbling on the surface of the sea. Danger: A team of workers who helped tackle the Deepwater Horizon disaster, pictured, off the coast of America has been flown in to cap the leak . Disaster: The Deepwater Horizon explosion killed and injured dozens, which is why hundreds have been evacuated from the Elgin platform and an exclusion zone set up . Total says it still does not know the cause of the leak and is taking 'all possible measures' to bring it under control. But oil insiders say the gas leak on the Elgin platform is a ‘major, . major problem’ and it is feared it could be coming directly from . the reservoir and would be difficult to stop. Investigators from Oil Spill Response (OSRL) yesterday carried out two . aerial surveillance flights to assess the situation and two further . flights are planned today. There have been no reports of any injuries. Leak: A boat works to collect oil that has come from the Deepwater Horizon wellhead, a disaster that cost BP £5 billion . Total said it yesterday met the Secretary of State’s representative, the Health and Safety Executive, the Department of Energy and Climate change, Marine Scotland and the coastguard to discuss the problem. The company said it has also mobilised experts from elsewhere in the Total Group to offer additional assistance and help deal with the incident. 'Total E&P UK confirms that the gas leak at the Elgin Well Head Platform remains ongoing, although the situation is currently stable,' a spokesman said. 'We continue to take all possible measures to try to identify the source and cause of the leak and to bring it under control.' The leak on the Total platform comes after Chancellor George Osborne expressed his support for gas as a cheap and relatively clean fuel that would remain important for UK supplies, with measures to support new gas power stations. He also announced £3 billion in tax breaks for deep water oil and gas exploration to the west of Shetland. Friends of the Earth energy campaigner Paul Steedman said: 'Leaks like this make Osborne's dash for gas even more absurd - it could be months before it's sorted, posing a huge safety risk to workers and releasing a greenhouse gas 20 times more climate-wrecking than carbon dioxide. 'Gas is already pushing our fuel bills through the roof - now people will be wondering whether they'll be asked to cover the cost of the leak. 'It's time we shifted to clean and safe British energy from the wind, sun and sea - this, and slashing energy waste, is our best hope for affordable power.'","A four-mile exclusion zone has been set up around the Elgin Total platform .

It has been unveiled that the Prince of Wales's staff have been working in key government departments . Prince Charles has been accused of planting 'moles' in the heart of government after it emerged members of his staff had been working full-time in Whitehall departments. One of his employees was seconded to a policy team at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for around a year. Another aide working for the heir to the throne spent two years at the Cabinet Office, which deals with cross-cutting issues across the whole of government and is based next to Number 10. A third was based there for six weeks. The allegations sparked further allegations that the Prince of Wales was meddling in government and abandoning the traditional of royal neutrality in politics - with one MP describing him as a 'constitutional crisis in waiting'. The Sunday Times, which exposed the existence of the seconded staff, said that some current and former ministers in the two departments knew nothing of the appointments. The revelations come a week after the Mail disclosed that the Prince of Wales has had 36 private audiences with Cabinet ministers since the election - one a month. Alongside seven meetings with the Prime Minister, he also met a disproportionately high number of ministers from departments representing issues of personal interest to him, including the environment, alternative medicine and town planning. It raised questions over whether the Prince was lobbying for his pet issues. But Clarence House robustly defended the summits, saying it was his right and duty to meet any minister 'he chooses'. They also said some meetings were requested by the ministers rather than the Prince. And last night they defended the presence of the prince's staff in government, denying claims that the secondees were doing the Prince's work in government. A spokeswoman said the three secondees . were junior members of staff, aged in their 20s, who would not have . come into contact with the Prince very often. She . pointed out that the staff made their own requests for experience in . government departments for their own professional development reasons. Prince Charles has a keen interest in rural affairs and the environment . Labour MP Paul Flynn, member of the Commons public administration committee, said news of the secondments suggested the prince was a 'constitutional crisis in waiting'. 'Planting his civil service moles proves an intention to abandon royal political neutrality,' he said. 'He clearly doesn't accept the principle of an independent and politically neutral monarchy. I am astonished that he should have had his people in the civil service in this way with ministers not even being aware they were there. 'Constitutional monarchs should be above politics. What is he doing except to advance his own agenda? It's outrageous.' Paul Farrelly, another Labour backbencher, said the House of Commons needed an explanation as to why this had been allowed to happen. 'It raises constitutional questions about the influence the monarch-in-waiting has over policy and there will be questions in the House when it returns,' he said. It is not the first time concerns have been raised over the Prince's influence on the political process . Yesterday one minister in one of the two departments affected said he had no idea that a member of the Prince's staff was working there - and demanded to know if they had any influence on policy. He told the Sunday Times it was 'undemocratic' and said: 'There are urgent questions that need to be answered about who agreed it. 'It raises questions about whether Prince Charles is exceeding his position as constitutional monarch in waiting. There is a question about what they are doing and whether they are influencing policy.' Later this year, the public administration committee will conduct an investigation into the Prince's constitutional position which means ministers have been forced to seek his permission to pass at least a dozen government bills. The committee will ask whether there is a risk that the requirement of royal consent 'could be seen as politicising the monarchy'. A spokeswoman for Clarence House would not provide the identities of the secondees or say what tasks they had undertaken. She said staff from departments such as the Foreign Office are often seconded with the Prince of Wales's office. 'We have had two secondments to government departments in the past two years,' she said. 'The secondments were suggested on the basis of professional development and the paperwork was arranged by the relevant HR departments. 'One secondment was one year and the other was for two years. Both have some to a natural conclusion. There was no official feedback mechanism and no regular meetings were attended with the Prince of Wales's household. 'The secondments were on a like-for-like basis. One secondee has now left Clarence House and the other is due to return shortly after a sabbatical. 'Over the past five years, in addition to the two secondments already discussed, there has been one other secondment, for six weeks to the Cabinet Office. We have no new secondments planned at present.' Defra said the Prince's aide was not involved in any issues related to the Duchy of Cornwall, his landholding from which he made £19million last year.","One of his employees was seconded to a policy team at DEFRA .

Money doesn't just fall out of the sky - except for residents of Lewes, Delaware, who had $10,000 showered over them from above on Saturday afternoon. A helicopter appeared in the sky over the Lewes Harbor, according to the Cape Gazette, and hovered there for five minutes divesting itself of the cash, then flew off. The windfall came courtesy of Leonard Maull, who owned a bait and tackle shop in the town before his death last year. Make it rain: Leonard Maull stipulated that $10,000 be showered over the town of Lewes where he lived and worked on the first anniversary of his death . Maull left specific instructions in his . will for $10,000 in $5, $10, $20 and $50 notes to be dropped from an . aircraft over the Lewes Marina on the first anniversary of his death. Staff at the Irish Eyes pub were working their Saturday afternoon shift when they noticed the helicopter approaching. Server Tina Chaippini told the Cape Gazette that people were running towards the helicopter and returning with fistfuls of money. Another stafff member, Billy Anderson, said he suddenly noticed customers pointing at the sky. 'I’m hearing, ""Crash, crash.""  What they’re saying is, ""Cash, cash,""' he said. According to the Cape Gazette, local police were aware of the plan and sent an officer to the marina to ensure nothing got out of hand - but there was no need. 'Nobody was, like, fighting with each other for it, but everyone was just scrambling trying to grab everything they could,' said Irish Eyes manager Kara Miele, who scooped up $170. Cash storm: Money doesn't grow on trees, but sometimes it falls right out of the sky, as it did for some lucky Lewes residents over the weekend . 'This is probably one of the most exciting things that ever happened here, I would assume,' she said. The man behind the money, Leonard Maull, owned Henlopen Bait and Tackle in the town and visited the marina at least once a day . Maull's trustee, certified public accountant Bill Berry, told the Cape Gazette that Maull left the request in his trust. 'It was his money, and I figured he could do what he wanted to do with it,' Berry said. A friend of Maull, James Walsh, told the Gazette that he doesn't know why Maull chose to have his money dropped over the town. 'I would’ve never thought Leonard would do anything like this,' he said. But do something like that he did, as the people of Lewes can testify.

The father of a Florida teen accused of ruthlessly murdering two people during a month-long shooting spree now faces felony charges for purchasing the gun used in the slayings for his 15-year-old son and allowing him access to the weapon and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. According to authorities, Lothar Schafer took his son to the Mega Gun and Armory gun shop in Kissimme in June - the day before the shootings began - and bought him a .45 caliber, High Point carbine rifle. 'The rifle was used in multiple shooting incidents in Osceola County...including in the shooting death of 17-year-old David Guerrero,' a police statement said. Negligence: Lothar Schafer faces felony charges for supplying his 15-year-old son with the gun police say he used to murder two people . Schafer said he bought the boy the weapon - as well as hundreds of rounds of ammunition - because he was 'having problems with unidentified subjects in Poinciana, Florida,' according to an arrest affidavit obtained by the Orlando Sentinel. Schafer's son, Konrad Schafer, is being tried as an adult for allegedly murdering Guerrero and University of Central Florida student Eric Roopnarine, as well as firing dozens of live rounds at houses and cars during late-night joyrides with his alleged accomplices. Guerrero was fatally shot as he waited at a bus stop on June 26. '[Schafer] thought it would be fun to shoot Mr Guerrero,' Kissimmee Police Chief Lee Massie said. 'This is the type of individuals we put in jail today.' About a week later, on July 3, Schafer and the three other suspects - Victoria Rios, 17; David Damus, 20; and Juan Muriel, 20 - forced their way into a home belonging to 22-year-old Eric Roopnarine, police said. The suspects had allegedly tricked Roopnarine into thinking he was going to have sex with Victoria Rios, a runaway, when they entered his home. Once inside, Damus shot Roopnarine in the head with Schafer's gun and Schafer slit the man's throat. Konrad Schafer (left) was arrested . along with David Damus, 20, (right) in connection with a string of . 14 shootings, which left two men dead . Two additional suspects, Juan Sebastian . Muriel, 20, (right) and Victoria Rios, 17, (left) were also arrested in connection with . one of the brutal murders . The suspects targeted Roopnarine because they believed he had money, according to police. Konrad Schafer told police that he took the gun out of his father's house on a regular basis - even after he was told not to. 'Lothar learned of one of Konrad's shootings and took the firearm away from him,' the affidavit stated. 'However, Konrad was able to access it again and continue to commit shootings with it. … Konrad admitted to retrieving the firearm from Lothar's residence, and using it to commit multiple shootings as well as the murder of David Guerrero.' Police said Schafer acquired this .45-caliber rifle from his father. The elder Schafer said he purchased the firearm for personal protection . Police search for evidence where David Guerrero was shot as he was waiting for a bus. The search yielded a shell casing . Because of his alleged negligence, Lothar Schafer faces a felony charge of culpable negligence for allegedly leaving a loaded firearm within easy access of a minor who uses it to injure or kill someone. Additionally, he faces a misdemeanor charge of allowing unlawful possession of a firearm. The younger Schafer, and his three co-defendants, each have been charged with first-degree murder.

Authorities believe the posts about gun laws and the Wikipedia corrections were made by Sandy Hook murderer Adam Lanza . Sandy Hook gunman Adam Lanza was obsessed with correcting Wikipedia entries about mass killers, authorities believe. They are investigating whether a series of posts about firearms on gun message boards were uploaded by the 17-year-old Lanza. In one entry, the poster, who is suspected to be Lanza, wrote that he had a 'fetish' for .32 ACP bullets. Gun obsessed Lanza killed 20 young children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December, last year. The 20-year-old first shot his mother Nancy four times in the head before the rampage began - the worst school killing in American history. Lanza used two semi-automatic pistols, a Glock and Sig Sauer before taking his own life. Investigators and The Courant have now linked Lanza to the series of posts and the Wikipedia editing. The posts were made between April, 2009, and February, 2010, and if, as suspected, they were made by Lanza, they reveal his deep obsession with American mass shootings and the weapons used. Some of the posts question gun laws in Connecticut and include recommendations on the best rifles to buy. In one post, the person believed to be Lanza, questions whether a ban on semiautomatic pistols will be extended and is advised by other users to contact Connecticut State Police. He responds: 'I always prefer asking through proxy when I can avoid speaking to someone directly. I was just wondering if anyone knew because I have a fetish for .32 ACP', reports The Courant. Using the same username, the person also corrected details on 12 Wikipedia entries about mass shootings around the world. They included changing the weapon used . in the Dawson College shooting in Montreal in 2006, in which one . student was killed and 19 others wounded. The . Courant said the user, suspected to be Lanza, wrote in the revision . notes: '""9mm"" was listed as "".9mm."" People say that 9mm is anemic, but . this is ridiculous.' Lanza murdered 20 young children and six adults during a shooting rampage at Sandy Hook School . Investigators believe Lanza is behind the obsessive editing of 12 Wikipedia entries about mass shootings and they recovered articles on Norway murderer Anders Breivik (right) Entries on the shopper center shootings at the Sello Mall near Helsinki, Finland, in 2009, and the Omaha Westroads mall shooting in 2007 were also edited. An entry on the ESL Inc. massacre in 1988 was also changed. Seven people were killed and seven more injured at the manufacturing company in Sunnyvale, California and gunman Richard Farley's methods bear a clear similarity to Lanza's. Both men strapped hundreds of rounds of ammunition on a vest and wore earplugs before the mass shootings. Lanza is already known to have harboured an interest in mass shootings and police have previously found a New York Times cut out in his room about the murder of five people at Northern Illinois University. Articles about Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in 2011 in Norway, were also recovered.","Investigators have linked Lanza to series of posts on gun message boards .

Mr Evans, from Shropshire, said: 'It's a photograph of ""one-day eventing"" - like three-day eventing as seen in the Olympics, but condensed into one day. 'The riders start with dressage, then showjumping, then finish with a cross country. 'All these competitions are run under the auspices of British Eventing. Horse and rider were OK. Personally I wouldn't publicise an image where either got badly injured. 'It's rare that riders fall, but on this particular day, a number had difficulties. The general consensus as to why this happened was that the top rail of the fence was merging with the background, so some horses only saw the rail below it and got tipped up and unseated their riders. Also highly commended were James Gunn from Halkirk, Caithness for his picture of Welsh full back Leigh Halfpenny going over his own line after just getting to the ball first to prevent Sean Lamont of Scotland scoring a try during a Six Nations game at Murrayfield .

Tory activists are all swivel-eyed loons, according to a member of David Cameron’s inner circle. The senior figure was responding to comments by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond who suggested the Prime Minister’s proposals to legalise gay marriage had upset vast numbers of people. Some Conservatives believe that Right-winger Mr Hammond is positioning himself for a leadership bid. Right wing of the party: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said there was 'real sense of anger' about plans for gay marriage in a TV outburst . However, the senior Tory said Mr Cameron was unconcerned by the prospect . of further rebellions when the legislation returns to the Commons on . Monday. ‘It’s fine – there’s really no problem,’ he said. ‘The MPs just have to . do it because the associations tell them to do it, and the associations . are all mad, swivel-eyed loons.’ The comment by Mr Cameron’s close friend is a further sign of the . divisions the gay marriage proposals are causing within the Conservative . Party and will outrage grass-roots supporters. Mr Hammond told the BBC’s Question Time on Thursday that the plans had caused unnecessary offence to millions of voters. The introduction of civil partnerships in 2005 had already ended the . ‘real disadvantage’ that had faced  gay couples, he said. ‘This change . does redefine marriage – for millions and millions of people who are . married, the meaning of marriage changes. Headache: David Cameron faces trouble in the party as the rift over gay marriage widens . ‘There is a real sense of anger among many people who are married that . any government thinks it has the ability to change the definition of an . institution like marriage. I have never felt this is what we should be . focusing on.’ Aides to Mr Hammond pointed out that Tory MPs have a free vote on gay . marriage, and said he was only restating his long-standing opposition to . the legislation. A source close to Mr Hammond said: ‘The Defence Secretary is a loyalist . who totally supports the Prime Minister’s stance on Europe and is . working hard to find efficiency savings to help the Chancellor. His . stance on gay marriage is well known and is not new.’ Many Tory MPs believe Mr Hammond – once seen as the ultimate loyalist – . is trying to raise his profile to position himself for a potential . leadership bid. A senior Conservative source said there was a ‘pattern of behaviour’ emerging, following Mr Hammond’s outspoken opposition to defence cuts . and his revelation that he would vote to leave the EU. Tense: Equalities Minister Maria Miller is offering to review civil partnerships for heterosexual couples to head off a rebellion . ‘Why does he feel the need to keep speaking out in such strong terms? The vast majority of the public support gay marriage, so you have to . wonder if his intended audience is Tory activists,’ the source added. Tory MP Peter Bone, a leading opponent of gay marriage, welcomed Mr . Hammond’s intervention, saying: ‘The Defence Secretary is completely . right. There is no mandate for this and most members of the Conservative . Party are completely opposed to it.’ Mr Cameron is braced for a bruising week on the issue, with a string of Commons votes expected on Monday and Tuesday. One senior Tory joked: ‘This week we had Europe, next week we’ve got gay marriage – it’s all going very well.’ Rebels will try to force Mr Cameron to hold a referendum on gay marriage . before it becomes law. They argue he has no mandate for the change as . it was not in either the Tory or Lib Dem manifestos. Rebels are also plotting to side with Labour to push through a change . that would allow civil partnerships for heterosexual couples. Ministers . oppose the change, fearing it could encourage cohabiting couples to take . advantage of the inheritance and pension rights associated with civil . partnerships. On Thursday, Equality Minister Maria Miller unveiled plans for a review . on the issue, but it would not take place until five years  after gay . marriage is introduced and was dismissed as inadequate by critics. Crossbench peer Lord Dear announced he will table a motion opposing the . second reading of the Bill in the Lords on June 3. He said it was right . for the Lords to reject a Bill if it feels the executive is ‘clearly . acting with no democratic mandate and without regard to the proper . constitutional processes’.","Comment made after Hammond criticised Cameron’s gay marriage plans .

Tickets were going on sale this morning for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Pictured is an artist's impression of how Hampden Park will look . Mo Farah is expected to be one of the big draws of the Commonwealth Games next year . Jamieson, who won an Olympic silver medal for the 200m breaststroke in London last year, trained at Tollcross when he was a boy and will return to compete for Commonwealth gold for Team Scotland next summer. Young swimmers from Glasgow School of Sport will join the Olympian as he launches the start of ticket sales, with two-thirds of them costing less than £25. The swimmer anticipates Glasgow 2014 will be a highlight of his career and has encouraged people to get a seat and watch it live. 'The difference between watching a big multi-sport event on television or actually being there and experiencing it is second to none,' said the swimmer. 'These are elite athletes in every one of the 17 sports competing against their rivals so no matter which sport you get tickets for you will be enthralled, excited and entertained. There is nothing to beat live sport.' Lord Smith of Kelvin, Glasgow 2014 Chairman, said: 'Glasgow 2014 in every sense is a Games for everyone and a fantastic opportunity to experience world-class sport up close in one of the world's great sporting cities. We look forward to welcoming elite athletes from across the Commonwealth and the best welcome we can give them are stadia packed with supporters cheering them on. The Glasgow-born ambassador for the Games Michael Jamieson is due to signal the start of the process by diving into the refurbished pool at the Tollcross International Swimming Centre . Usain Bolt has said he wants to make an appearance at the games next year .

Deputy first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said: 'This is a chance to be part of one of the world's biggest events and the largest ever multi-sport event in Scotland. 'With affordable ticket prices and concessions for children and over 60s, this is a truly family friendly Games that will guarantee top class sporting drama for spectators and a great Glasgow welcome for visitors.' Mike Cantlay, chairman of VisitScotland, said: 'We're working hard to promote the Games as a must see event next year with Glasgow the start of a fantastic adventure here in Scotland. 'Our message is clear enjoy a magnificent Commonwealth Games, enjoy one of the best cities in the world - now go and enjoy the rest of Scotland.'

If you cannot get on the internet today, there may be a good reason why - the FBI might be shutting you down. The U.S. law enforcement agency will be blocking up to 500,000 users around the world who have a malicious program installed on their computer. It will affect anyone who inadvertantly downloaded a piece of 'malware' called DNSChanger, which redirects users to fake advertising websites. Internet shutdown: Software called Alureon/DNS Changer attempts to change the website you visit - and those infected may get cut off on Monday . Internet providers have plans to help their customers on Monday and others are braced for calls to helplines because thousands around the country whose computers were infected with malicious software more than a year ago faced the possibility of not being able to get online. The FBI is taking the unusual step in a bid to shut down DNSChanger, thought to have been created by Eastern European cyber-criminals. It is not known how many computers in the UK are affected, but 12 per cent of the top 500 U.S. companies are said to have infected PCs or Macs. Some providers may put technical solutions in place that will correct the server problem that could hit some computers after midnight EDT Sunday. It they do, the Internet will work, but the malware will remain on victims' computers and could pose future problems, said Tom DeGrasso, an FBI supervisory special agent. If you are worried about the impending meltdown, follow these steps: . 1) Visit this FBI-approved site - http://www.dns-ok.us - and see if you get an 'all-clear' green . background or an 'at risk' red background. 2) If you have a red background, visit http://www.dcwg.org/fix which lists free virus scanner and removal software. Our personal recommendations from the free range are Microsoft Windows Defender and Avira. For more information, visit here: http://www.dcwg.org/detect/ . The FBI arranged for a private company to run a website - http://www.dcwg.org . - as a place where computer users could go to see if their computer was . infected and find links to other computer security business sites where . they could find fixes for the problem. From . the onset, most victims didn't even know their computers were infected, . although the malicious software probably has slowed their web surfing . and disabled their antivirus software, making their machines more . vulnerable to other problems. Many computer . users don't understand the complex machines they use every day to send . email, shop, and cruise for information. The cyberworld of viruses, . malware, bank fraud and Internet scams is often distant and confusing, . and warning messages may go unseen or unheeded. Marcin Kleczynski, chief executive of Malwarebytes, which makes a free piece of software designed to remove the malware, said: 'The FBI left the criminal servers running to give infected users time to remove this piece of malware, however it is estimated there are still hundreds of thousands of people who just don't know they are infected. 'Monday is D-day because anyone who still has this piece of malware on their computer simply won't be able to access the internet. 'This means people will struggle to repair the problem because they won't be able to download removal tools or access information through the infected laptop or computer. 'The total cost could be significant.' A FBI spokesman said: 'We've been using the last eight months to go out and clean up the infected computers, but we don't have everybody.' To the rescue: For those who didn't check the site designed to inform users if they are infected (pictured), Internet providers have plans to help their customers on Monday and others are braced for calls . Experts are taking the warning . seriously, but in reference to the Millennium Bug which supposedly . threatened to shut Britain down, one blogger wrote: ‘Yet another ploy to . get everyone freaked out…remember Y2K.’ There is an underlying sense that this will be much ado about nothing, such as the approach of 2000. The transition to that year presented technical problems and fears that some computers would stop working because they were not set up for the date change. In the end there were very few problems. Considering there are millions of Internet users across the country, several thousand isn't a big deal, unless you're one of them. Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., and co-founder of Congress' cybersecurity caucus, said computer users have a responsibility to practice good sense and make sure their computers are not infected or being hijacked by criminals. 'These types of issues are only going to increase as our society relies more and more on the Internet, so it is a reminder that everyone can do their part,' he said. FBI officials have been tracking the number of computers they believe still may be infected by the malware. As of Wednesday, there were about 45,600 in the U.S. - nearly 20,000 less than a week ago. Worldwide, the total is roughly 250,000 infected. The numbers have declined steadily, and recent efforts by Internet service providers may limit the problems on Monday. If you see your computer isn't functioning properly throughout the day today, customer support lines could be your best solution.","Those who downloaded DNSChanger will be affected .

This plastic water bottle is fitted with a Nasa-inspired filtration system so powerful it can turn cola into clear, colourless liquid, the manufacturers claim. ÖKO's 'advanced filtration water bottle' draws on technology originally developed by Nasa to ensure the drinker's every sip is 'pure, fresh and clean'. This video footage of the bottle being put to the test shows it being filled with brown Coca Cola which, after being poured through the special filter cap, looks exactly like water. Scroll down for video . The raw ingredients: A plastic water bottle with a filtration system, and a bottle of coke . The water bottle with a filter developed from Nasa technology is filled with Coke as the experiment progresses . The coke is miraculously turned into what appears to be water by the filter . The finished drink: The resulting liquid was described as 'like sugar water' VIDEO: Watch the Nasa-inspired water filtration system in action . The manufacturer used a video demonstrating the effect of the filter on cola on its website, but a tester for rocketnews24.com decided to check out the results for himself. The footage of the experiment shows how his trial using his own ÖKO bottle yielded the same results at first. 'The first streams of liquid were completely colourless, but became tinged with brown as I continued to pour,' his report said. 'I was a little disappointed that it wasn't completely colourless, but pressed on. 'I took a sip and was again disappointed to find that it wasn't tasteless,' said the tester, who added that it tasted 'like sugar water'. The Coca Cola experiment on the OKO website is aimed at illustrating the effectiveness of the bottle, which is designed to filter water, not other drinks. The eco-friendly water container comes in three different filtration levels. The Level-1 filter is carbon based and designed to reduce chlorine and odour from tap water. Powerful: The filtration system used for the plastic water containers was inspired by Nasa technology . The Level-2 filter contains more than 400 tiny pores and uses a positively charged electro-absorption process to trap harmful agents as water passes through it. According to the manufacturer, charge fields activated upon contact with water virtually close the pore to any intruding agents. 'Using built-in silver ions, the material then kills bacteria upon contact,' the OKO website says. The third level of filtration is designed for the treatment of known elements in large volumes of water in extreme environments. Level-3 is not available to buy at retail.","Filter on the water container developed using Nasa technology .

With only thin justifications, NSA agents have been spying on Americans online without a warrant- reading emails, chats and browsing histories. Today, The Guardian broke down the process by which NSA analysts tap internet activity by publishing a training guide used to introduce new . analysts to X-Keyscore. Described as the 'widest-ranging' database, X-Keyscore allows analysts to wiretap basically anyone. Snowden was referring to the system when he said in June: ‘I, . sitting at my desk can wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a . federal judge or even the president, if I had a personal email.’ How they did it: New documents published in The Guardian today show how NSA analysts like Edward Snowden spied on Americans without a warrant . Massive reach: X-KEYSCORE is a program involving over 700 servers worldwide that supposedly hold basically everything that every casual user does on the internet . The manual explained in detail how analysts could side-step . warrants and spy on ‘nearly everything a typical user does on the internet’ – . including the web activity of Americans. These revelations come in light of a congressional hearing . taking place today which Representative Alan Grayson said would be ‘an ad hoc, . bipartisan hearing on domestic surveillance.’ Senior intelligence officials from the Department of Justice, NSA, Office of National Intelligence, and the FBI, as . well as critics, will be speaking about the surveillance program. Hearing: The Senate Judiciary Committee is holding a hearing today on the surveillance programs carried out by the NSA . Legally, the NSA is not allowed to spy on U.S. persons . without a Fisa warrant. But X-Keyscore provides a loophole for this law. If an American had contact with a foreign target, that allows . the NSA to track them without a warrant. Analysts just provide a justification for the tapping, . usually from several excuses, some included in a drop-drown menu, and they can start . surveillance. No court official or NSA official signed off on the . individual justifications. 'It's very rare to be questioned on our searches,’ Snowden . said in June. ‘and even when we are it's usually along the lines of: let's bulk . up the justification' The NSA denies this claim, issuing a statement to the . newspaper today that there are ‘multiple technical, manual and supervisory . checks and balances within the system to prevent deliberate misuse from . occurring.’ And once tapped, the type of information searchable is startling. All they need is simple information such as an email, IP address or . phone number to access web activity. Manual: An excerpt from the X-Keyscore training guide shows how simple log-in information allows analysts to access a wide-range of information online . By entering a person’s email and a justification, an analyst . can read all email exchanges, narrowing down by time range. Justification: Analysts can read personal email exchanges with an address and a simple 'justification' for the surveillance . Analysts . could also read chats and private message on social-networking site Facebook simply by entering the target’s . username and a date range. They could perform reverse searches as well, entering a specific . website and gaining information on all the IP addresses that visited it. The sheer amount of information being collected online is so large . that most information can only be stored for three to five days. To store ‘interesting data’  for longer, the agency built a database that . can hold some documents for as long as five years. According to an NSA report published in 2007, 850billion ‘call . events’ had been collected and stored, and about 150billion internet records. They reported that each day 1-2billion new records were added. In 2012, there were 41billion total records in the . X-Keyscore system for one 30-day period. While the agency has tried to keep U.S. communications separate . from foreign communications, they have admitted that even . strictly U.S. communications can travel on foreign systems and it’s sometimes . hard to identify the national origin of of a communication. Domestic surveillance: Drop-down menus give analysts several justifications to monitor Americans based on a foreign target connection . In their statement, the NSA continued to defend their broad . surveillance: ‘These types of programs allow us to collect the information that . enables us to perform our missions successfully – to defend the nation and to . protect U.S. and allied troops abroad.’ Wide-ranging: X-Keyscore allowed analysts access to 'nearly everything a typical user does on the internet' Hoping to stop some . of the opposition in congress to domestic surveillance, the Obama . administration announced today that it will declassify a set of documents on its telephone . spying program. The . documents will provide little solace, however, to Americans hoping to . understand the legal analysis that underpinned the widespread . surveillance. And the redacted documents show only in broad strokes how NSA officials use the data. One particular type of analysis, called ""hop analysis"" is hinted at but never fully discussed. That allows the government to search the phone records of not only suspected terrorists, but everyone who called them, everyone who called those people, and others who called them, as well. With that authority, the government can search the records of millions of people in an investigation of one person.","Training manuals on the NSA's web spying system were released today .

Kennedy by a French aristocrat in 1937 is now available to the public. The intriguing story of Eight & Bob reportedly began when the former president was a college student on vacation in the French Riveria. Fashionista reports that he struck up a conversation with Frenchman Albert Fouquet by asking him what fragrance he was wearing. Story behind the packaging: Eight & Bob was reportedly smuggled inside empty hardcover books to avoid Nazi inspectors during World War II , hence the style of the box . Mr Fouquet, a perfumer, left a fragrance sample at JFK’s hotel with a note that said, 'In this jar, you . will find the dash of French glamour that your American personality . lacks.' When Kennedy got back to the States, he sent Mr Fouquet a letter saying that all his friends back home loved the fragrance, and asked for eight samples - and 'if your production . allows, another one for Bob' (meaning his brother Robert Kennedy). Mr Fouquet complied, and after he labeled the samples 'Eight & Bob', the brand was born. The perfumer was shocked when he began receiving requests from Hollywood stars like Cary Grant and James Stewart, who had been introduced to the scent by Mr Kennedy's father Joe. Rich scent: The main note in the fragrance inspired by John F Kennedy, pictured here in 1961, remains secret . Back story: The Kennedy family has never confirmed or denied Mr Fouquet's story of celebrity, intrigue and very creative packaging . In 1939, Mr Fouquet died in a car accident. In his absence, the company claims that Fouquet family butler Phillippe continued to fill orders until the start of World War II forced him to leave his job. Family fragrance: Eight & Bob was named for samples sent to JFK (left) and his brother Robert Kennedy (right) In the last shipments he sent, Philippe hid the bottles . inside books that he carefully cut by hand to prevent the Nazis from . seizing the perfume. But his family later recovered the formula and production process, and . Eight & Bob hit the market again for the first time in 60 years. The ingredients to the woody vanilla fragrance remain a closely-guarded secret. The company says that the fragrance contains extracts of the Andrea plant, which is a nickname Mr Fouquet . gave to the plant when he discovered it on a trip to Chile. A perfume representative told Fashionista that the scent  'smells very much like 1940s.' It can only . be harvested in December and January, and only 7per cent of the harvest is . usable, so the company does not know how much product will be available until the process is complete. The perfume comes in one size for $195, and it’s sold in a hardcover . book as as a nod to Philippe’s clever . Nazi-outsmarting packaging technique.

"By . Helen Lawson . PUBLISHED: . 06:09 EST, 27 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:40 EST, 28 June 2013 . Dr Ravi Sondhi is facing a fitness to practise tribunal in Manchester over his role as a director of an out-of-hours service . A £230,000-a-year GP ran a Croydon out-of-hours service for nearly a million patients from his Norfolk home 125 miles away, a tribunal heard. Dr Ravi Sondhi, 52, also took £100,000 from Croydoc, an NHS-funded out-of-hours service and took up to three hours to answer urgent calls, it is claimed. Sondhi was often uncontactable at his home in Fakenham, Norfolk, when he was supposed to be on duty, forcing patients to go to accident and emergency instead, a Medical Practitioners Service Tribunal heard. Sondhi, who also owned a string of care homes, also allegedly made a series of racist comments in emails. In one message he asked: ‘Did you know Jamaicans are immune to swine flu as they are swines anyway?’ He told a colleague: ‘My computer has inherited a black virus. It does not want to work’, it is claimed. One said: ‘Of course we are on a permanent holiday. We learnt it when we went to Africa,' while another read: ‘Bloody foreigner. She probably wants Jamaican ginger cakes, Jaffa cakes and black and white Hobnobs.’ Sondhi, who was suspended by the service in 2009, had taken unauthorised cash advances of up to £80,000 for himself and his wife, Dr Salma Uddin, who also worked for the service, by November 2008 the tribunal heard. By 2009, this had risen to £100,000 more than the couple were entitled to from Croydoc. A damning report by NHS Croydon last . year found that Sondhi consistently failed to answer the telephone when . on call, with 144 answered calls logged in only one evening. He took as long as three hours to . respond to urgent calls instead of the 20 minute target and repeatedly . cancelled shifts without warning. The panel heard that up to three quarters of patients phoning the service were referred to A&E during some of his overnight shifts. On one occasion a three-year-old girl . with breathing difficulties had to be taken to hospital after three . failed attempts to contact Sondhi. Paul Ozin QC, for the General Medical Council, told the Manchester hearing: ‘It was obvious the taking of advances without authority from the board was wrong. ‘It was not a one-off, although it was perhaps presented as one by Dr Sondhi when he purported to tell the board when it became inescapable. ‘Dr Sondhi had plenty of time to bring it to the attention of the board.' In 2007 Sondhi approached Croydoc's chief executive Sue Ballon, who was also suspended, saying he ‘urgently needed’ an advance against his salary and said he would take responsibility for it. On one occasion he went over Ms Ballon's head to get the money when she told him there were insufficient funds. Sondhi was described as a ‘dominant figure’ who was able to ‘do as he wanted’ and was not kept in check by a ‘weak’ board of directors. Croydoc’s auditor, Anthony Brand, discovered the irregularities in July 2009. But Sondhi continued to lie, telling Mr Brand he had informed the board and they were happy with what he was doing, the tribunal heard. In August 2009, Mr Brand sent a 'bombshell' letter to Croydoc's directors about the payments, which were then branded as a 'fraudulent act' and 'serious abuse of his position' in a directors' meeting. The debt was to be paid back by Sondi and Uddin by working shifts for the company. But £41,910 was written off at the end of 2010 with 'no realistic prospect of recovery,' said Mr Ozin. Croydoc, founded in 1995, won . lucrative NHS contracts from Croydon, Kingston, and Sutton and Merton . primary care trusts to provide out-of-hours care for nearly a million . patients. Under Sondhi’s leadership the company introduced ‘segmenting’, where only one doctor would be on hand to cover all three areas. Sondhi is also said to have been verbally aggressive, intimidating, and abusive towards colleagues and sent to have sent racist messages . Mr Odin said the arrangement was 'manifestly inadequate'. The GMC alleges that Sondhi lied to fellow directors in order to mislead them over how much cover was provided. Croydoc has since been replaced as the out-of-hours service provider. Sondhi could be struck off from the medical register or suspended if his fitness to practise is found to be impaired by misconduct. He is accused of failing to provide good clinical care to patients and failing to ensure that an adequate level of doctor cover was available. It is also claimed that he was unavailable to make home visits or to see patients while on duty. He is accused of failing to act 'with probity' and misleading his fellow Croydoc directors over the financial advances he took from the service. Sondi is also alleged to have been verbally aggressive, intimidating, and abusive towards colleagues and to have sent racist messages. The hearing continues.

Waving a placard protesting 'Muslims only guilty of worshipping Allah', this is believed to be Woolwich terror . suspect Michael Adebolajo, marching with a group that openly called for the . beheading of British troops. This new picture shows the radical, now 28, at a Muslims Against Crusaders rally, six years before he and Michael Adebowale, 22, allegedly hacked Drummer Lee Rigby to death. Dressed in white robes, pointing to the sky and yelling aggressively, he joined dozens who protested outside Paddington Green police station in West London in 2007 after a Muslim extremist was arrested. The now-banned group became famous after members set fire to poppies on Remembrance Day in 2010, and chanted 'British soldiers burn in hell'. This new picture, which is almost certainly Adebolajo, raises further questions about how much the security services knew about him. Pictured: A young man identified as Michael Adebolajo at a Muslims Against Crusaders rally in 2007, a group who had openly called for the beheading of British soldiers . Drama: Hours after the shocking murder, footage emerged of this man with bloodied hands carrying a knife and a machete explaining the reasons for the killing. He has been identified as British Nigerian Michael Adebolajo, who is known by the Muslim name Mujahid . Firebrand cleric Anjem Choudary had links to the group and he admits he first met Adebolajo in 2005 – two years after the alleged terrorist had converted to Islam. But in the wake of the horrifying Woolwich attack, Choudary has claimed he hadn't seen him for two years. But despite him being accused of the . dreadful killing of Lee Rigby 25, he still described Adebolajo as a man . of 'impeccable character'. Machinegunner Rigby was hacked to death by two attackers in Woolwich, south-east London on Wednesday at 2.20pm. Michael . Adebolajo, 28, and his alleged accomplice Michael Adebowale, 22, are . believed to have run down the off-duty British soldier with a Vauxhall . Tigra as he walked back to the Woolwich Barracks, crushing his body . against a road sign. Witnesses . said the terror suspects then 'hacked and chopped' at his body like . 'crazed animals', before dragging his corpse into the middle of the road . leaving a trail of blood. Hero: Father Lee Rigby, 25, was executed by two suspected Islamic terrorists in Woolwich on Wednesday afternoon and has prompted calls for a crackdown on dangerous groups . Controversial: Then Muslims Against Crusaders member Emdadur Choudhury (left) was fined £50 fine for burning a poppy and he was supported outside court in 2011 by a group of protesters (right) Suspect: Michael Adebowale, 22, of Greenwich, south-east London, with a knife in his hand at the scene where Lee Rigby was stabbed to death . As they apparently tried to decapitate him they were chanting: 'this is what God would have wanted'. A blood-soaked man believed to be Adebolajo, who was still holding a number of weapons in his red-stained hands, then ranted on camera in a clear London accent: 'You people will never be safe. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.' Within 20 minutes armed officers arrived and the fundamentalists charged at them wielding firearms, knives and a machete. Police opened fire, taking the pair down with up to eight bullets. The suspects remain under armed guard in two separate London hospitals. Weapon: This battered car was used to crush the soldier against a sign in front. The streak of blood in front shows how they dragged his body into the street . Picture: This image was the first to emerge on Twitter, showing people close to the soldier's dead body while police hang over the men they have just shot . Response: Radical Anjem Choudary has admitted her knew Adebolajo and called him a 'pleasant, quiet guy' The new image shows Adebolajo was probably linked to Muslims Against Crusaders. Home Secretary Theresa May banned the group in November 2011 after it planned to repeat its poppy burning protest. The first one led to the conviction of Emdadur Choudhury who  laughed at justice as he was handed a . paltry £50 fine for setting light to poppies on Remembrance Day and . yelling ‘British soldiers burn in hell’. After hearing his penalty, which outraged war veterans, he declared: ‘I don’t have any respect for British soldiers, and if they lose a limb or two in Afghanistan then they deserve it. You expect me to feel sorry for them? Of course I don’t.’ Choudhury, from Bethnal Green, East London, was found guilty of using threatening or abusive words or behaviour, and at the time the court heard how he enjoyed benefits including a free council flat and almost £800 a month state handouts. Although Choudhury sneered that he would have been fined more than £50 for a parking offence, he is refusing to pay. However the bill will be picked up by his ‘good friend’ Anjem Choudary, the notorious firebrand preacher.

War on the welfare state: Chancellor George Osborne in the Commons yesterday where he announced a further £11.5billion cut to benefits . George Osborne went to war on the bloated welfare state and public sector wage bill yesterday. Savaging the ‘vested interests’ that have opposed his spending cuts so far, the Chancellor put benefit cuts at the heart of the next election campaign. He set out plans to extend austerity into the next Parliament with £11.5 billion in fresh reductions, making it a key battleground for the general election in 2015. He announced a new cap on the overall welfare bill, a requirement for foreign benefit claimants to learn English and a seven-day wait before the jobless can sign on. The pain for millions of workers in the public sector will continue as they lose automatic pay rises awarded for time served. Another 144,000 jobs will be axed. However, government spending will still account for 43.1 per cent of national output in 2015/16 – little change from the 43.6 per cent of 2012. Other key announcements yesterday included: . Scroll down for video . 'The reform will continue': Osborne announced a new cap on the overall welfare bill, a requirement for foreign benefit claimants to learn English and a seven-day wait before the jobless can sign on . Insisting Britain would face ruin unless it accepted a further period of austerity, Mr Osborne said he was taking action ‘to secure the recovery’. ‘While recovery from such a deep recession can never be straightforward, Britain is moving out of intensive care – and from rescue to recovery,’ he said. The Chancellor fiercely attacked Labour and the unions, telling MPs: ‘Every step of the way, every penny saved, every programme reformed, every entitlement reduced, every difficult choice taken, has been opposed by vested interests and those who got Britain into this mess in the first place. ‘We will not let up. I will not let that happen. The reform will continue.’ At the heart of yesterday’s spending review was the Chancellor’s argument that it is possible to roll back the state and get better public services at lower cost. He pointed to police reform and immigration where, despite lower budgets, crime and net migration have fallen dramatically. ‘What was the prediction from the opposition three years ago? Crime would rise. And what has happened instead? Crime is at its lowest level for 30 years, net migration down by more than a third,’ Mr Osborne said. ‘The Home Secretary is demonstrating that responsible budgets and reform can deliver better services for the public.’ Less money for better services? To back up his economic argument The Chancellor pointed to police reform and immigration where, despite lower budgetss, crime and net migration have fallen dramatically . Public spending, the Chancellor insisted, does not create sustainable growth. ‘Enterprise does,’ he said. ‘And the job of the state is to provide the schools, science, transport links and reliable energy that enable business to grow. ‘Britain was once the place where the future was invented: from the railway to jet engine to the world wide web. We can be that country again.’ Got off lightly: Vince Cable's Business Department got off relatively lightly with cuts of 6 per cent and a big increase in science spending . He said the Coalition had reduced the deficit by a third, put a record number of people into work and brought the economy back from the brink of bankruptcy. He confirmed total expenditure would continue to fall in real terms at the same rate as it is doing today, reaching £745billion in 2015. But the economic downturn has meant higher than expected debt interest payments and welfare payments, even though spending is being slashed in most government departments. The Department for Communities and Local Government, the Treasury and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs were among the hardest hit in the latest spending round, with 10 per cent budget cuts in 2015/16. Vince Cable’s Business Department, the last to reach a deal with the Treasury after tough negotiations, got off relatively lightly with cuts of 6 per cent and a big increase in science spending. However, student grants will be frozen. Labour had previously suggested it would not reverse the spending cuts announced for 2015-16, although it would borrow money to invest in infrastructure spending. But yesterday Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said that ‘in terms of the overall numbers of 15-16, I think the cuts are deeper than they need to be’. Mr Balls attacked an ‘out-of-touch Chancellor’ who had ‘failed on living standards, growth and the deficit, and families and businesses are paying the price for his failure’. ‘If the Chancellor continues with his failing economic plan, then it will fall to the next Labour government to turn the economy round and to take the tough decisions to get the deficit down in a fair way,’ he said. Not impressed: Shadow chancellor Ed Balls, centre, attacked an 'out-of-touch Chancellor' who had 'failed on living standards, growth and the deficit, and families and businesses are paying the price for his failure' Labour suggested that it would back English language tests for migrants and would ‘look at the detail’ of other benefit changes. Paul Johnson,  of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said there was a ‘good chance’ that whoever wins the election will put up taxes rather than pursuing even more spending cuts. Much spending would be one third or more down in real terms from 2010 if austerity continued at the same pace until 2017, he said. ‘The scale of the cuts are really astonishing,’ Mr Johnson said. ‘So, if I was a betting man I would think there would be some kind of tax rises after the election.’ Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ‘The spending review leaves business feeling like Oliver Twist – more please, Chancellor. ‘Please could you go further and faster with spending restraint? Please could you shift even more expenditure from current spending towards infrastructure? ‘Please could you widen the welfare cap to include pensions? But please could you also do less ring-fencing of spending in departments such as the NHS?’ But Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said: ‘George Osborne’s comprehensive spending review offers no hope and no growth and will cast the UK into economic gloom for the next decade.’","Chancellor slashes state spending by a further £11.5billion .

A representative for John Galliano has responded to the outrage over his outfit yesterday that appeared to resemble traditional . Hasidic Jewish clothing. The designer, who was fired from . Christian Dior in March 2011 after several drunken outbursts . and anti-Semitic remarks in a Paris cafe, was seen before the Oscar de la Renta show yesterday in a long black . jacket, charcoal homburg-style hat and hair in the style of twirled peyos - long sidelocks grown to demonstrate faith. But this evening, his spokesperson Liz Rosenberg insisted that the look was nothing more than a high fashion one, and that any suggestion that it was a comment on the Hasidic community is 'totally inaccurate'. Controversial clothing: John Galliano made a small but loud return to the fashion word yesterday, making his way to Oscar de la Renta's Fashion Week show dressed in an outfit that resembled Hasidic Jewish clothing . 'Mr Galliano has worn big hats and . has had long curly hair for many years,' she told MailOnline. 'He was in . designer attire from head-to-toe including a Stephen Jones hat and . Yohji Yamamoto pants.' Ms Rosenberg did not issue any kind of apology for yesterday's outfit, but did state that Mr Galliano 'continues to be committed to . making amends and seeking forgiveness from the Jewish community for his . insensitive remarks two years ago.' She added that 'he remains focused on his sobriety . daily' and 'has met with Jewish leaders around the world... '[He] continues to . make a sincere and heartfelt effort to understand his actions and demonstrate his contrition.' Mr Galliano, who had been helping Oscar de la Renta prepare for last night's . fall 2013 collection, shocked New York's Jewish community with his enseble yesterday. 'Mr Galliano has worn big hats and . has had long curly hair for many years. He was in . designer attire from head-to-toe' Williamsburg community leader Isaac Abraham told the New York Post: 'He’s trying to embarrass people in the Jewish community and make money on clothes [while] dressed like people he has insulted. 'It looks like the hairstyle he added was done purposely to insult,' he added. 'I would invite Mr. de la Renta and . Galliano to come to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, so I can show them some . Holocaust survivors and the clothes they [wear].' Meanwhile rabbi and fashion designer Tobi . Rubinstein Schneier commented: 'This was not very smart, unless he really . wants attention. I’m hoping that this is not in any way a mockery . through this attire.' Because Galliano was nowhere to be seen . front-of-house at de la Renta’s Tuesday night show, with visitors unable . to enter backstage, it is unclear if the controversial outfit was seen . by fashion industry critics at the event. But after the incident at Paris' La Perle . cafe, in which Galliano was video-recorded saying 'I love Hitler,' before telling an Italian woman, who wasn't . Jewish: 'People like you would be dead. Your mothers, your forefathers, . would all be f****** gassed,' being seen publicly in the distinguishing outfit was enough to ruffle feathers. FAshion friends: Galliano (left) returned to . the fashion word, temporarily, with a three week stint at Oscar de la . Renta's (right) studio in the lead up to his New York Fashion Week show . Brooklyn Assemblyman Dov Hikind said: 'Who is he mocking? The way the socks look, the jacket, the peyos . . . My question is, who’s he laughing at? 'If it was just anyone else, I wouldn’t . know what to say. But considering who this guy is, considering his . background and what he’s said in the past, let him explain it to all of . us: Are you mocking us?' Twitter users have also expressed their thoughts on Mr Galliano's outfit choice, which many found 'insulting' and 'shameful'. Beauty blogger Michelle Jones wrote: 'John Galliano- why? The House that Oscar de la Renta built is giving you a chance- must you mock it?' 'Is John Galliano really so talented that the world must put up with his shameful antics?' Another tweeted: 'Is John Galliano really so talented that the world must put up with his shameful antics?' But the fashion industry appears to be coming to the designer's defense. Steven Kolb, CEO of the CFDA, said the attacks against the designer were 'unfair.' He tweeted this morning: 'That is John's hair and how he dresses and certainly not a mockery of others,' before adding, 'Lets all take a deep breath, relax and remember it's just clothes!' Others disagreed. Mark Ferdman replied to Mr Kolb, tweeting: 'Show me [a] few more pics of him dressed like that over the past couple months, years and I'll consider that POV.' Galliano, who faced a maximum of six . months in jail on charges of 'public insults based on origin, religious . affiliation, race or ethnicity,' blamed work-related stress . and multiple substance addictions for his Paris outbursts, which he says he . can not remember. He was stripped of his Chevalier of the . Legion of Honor and ordered to pay suspended fines of 6,000 euros, as well as symbolic . damages and costs to each of his victims and to five anti-racism groups who were also complainants. Fashion comeback: Galliano was en route to Oscar de la Renta's fall 2013 Fashion Week show held last night; which Galliano spent three weeks helping the designer prepare . But . two years later, Galliano, . who designed Kate Moss' wedding dress in July 2011, seemed hopeful to . reintegrate himself into the fashion industry after his fall from grace - . the first step being a three week stint at Oscar de la Renta's studio . in the lead up to his New York Fashion Week show. 'I am an alcoholic,' Galliano . admitted to WWD last month, before explaining his readiness a return to the industry. 'I . have been in recovery for the past two years...I remain committed to making amends to those I have hurt. 'Several years prior to my sobriety, I descended into the . madness of the disease. I said and did things which hurt others, . especially members of the Jewish community. I have expressed my sorrow . privately and publicly for the pain which I caused, and I continue to do . so.' 'That is John's hair and how he dresses . and certainly not a mockery of others... Lets all take a . deep breath, relax and remember it's just clothes!' The Anti-Defamation League issued a statement defending the designer today, saying: 'There is no truth to [the] accusation that John Galliano was dressed in Hasidic garb, and anyone familiar with the dress of traditional Orthodox Jews should not mistake what Galliano is wearing in the photograph as ‘Hasidic garb. 'Hasidim do not wear fedora hats, pinstripe pants, blue jackets or an ascot tie,' he wrote. De la Renta, who called Galliano an 'immense talent,' also said last month: 'I think John is doing all the right things. Everyone in life deserves a second chance, especially someone as . talented as John. I think that life is about forgiving and helping . people.…I think John is doing all the right things.' Whether or not yesterday's outfit constitutes 'doing the right thing,' is debatable, however. One observing Lower East Side resident . told MailOnline: 'Either Galliano is so deluded that he thinks wearing . an outfit inspired by the dress of Hasidic Jews is some kind of apology, . or it is simply another callous insult from someone who is already . known as a drunken anti-Semite.

Paralympian Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, who led . the remuneration committee, cited the ‘impressive performance’ of the . transport network.

Twice-married Mr Johnson lost his job on the Tory front bench after . denying he had an affair with a journalist colleague. Claims: Sir Peter Hendy has refused to comment on reports that he had a nine-month affair with hooker Rachael Grundy . By Ray Massey, Transport Editor . Sir Peter Hendy is a mix of deep red and true blue blood. The multi-millionaire transport boss is the grandson of a baron and was educated at one of London’s top public schools – but his father Jack was a communist electrician, while his brother John is a QC and leading Left-wing barrister who has often represented London Underground’s nemesis, the RMT trade union led by Bob Crow. Sir Peter’s late mother Mary was the youngest daughter of the 6th Baron Wynford and grew up at Wynford Manor, the 16th century Dorset ancestral home of successive barons since 1829. She ‘came out’ as a debutante before turning to socialism, social work and nursing, eventually becoming a teacher in Ealing. Sir Peter attended the fee-paying Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith – where actors Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman were pupils – before reading economics at Leeds University. He began his career in 1975 as a London Transport graduate trainee, being taught how to drive a bus and work as a conductor. He rose swiftly through the ranks and in the late 1980s was appointed director of Centrewest, a subsidiary of the then state-owned London Buses. He led a £34million management buyout in 1995 – and his stake was worth £4.8million two years later when the firm was sold for £54million. Despite being a close ally of ‘Red’ Ken Livingstone when he was London mayor, Sir Peter quickly adapted to life under his Tory successor Boris Johnson, to whom he now reports, saying: ‘Oddly enough I think I get on better with Boris than I did with Ken.’ He also noted: ‘I was never as radical as my father. As for Boris, I’m not sure I’m more Left-leaning than he is.’ He became TfL commissioner in February 2006 and is now the capital’s longest-serving transport boss since the Second World War. Sir Peter caused a storm when he got rid of the traditional Routemaster London bus in favour of the ‘bendy buses’, which were abolished after several spontaneously ignited. He also supported the controversial western extension of the congestion charge – also now abolished.","Sir Peter Hendy 'had an affair with a hooker' in run-up to the Olympics .

And with just two bedrooms and a single bathroom spread over its modest 960 sq/ft living space, there's hardly enough living space for even the smallest family. Yet this unprepossessing 70-year-old bungalow at 353 Carmelita Drive in Mountain View, California, is on the market for a wallet-busting $1.1million (£700,000). The reason? It's less than ten minutes' drive from the headquarters of online search and advertising giant Google. Modestly extravagant: The unprepossessing . bungalow at 353 Carmelita Drive in Mountain View, California, which is . on the market for a massive $1.1million because it's so close to search . giant Google's headquarters . Who lives in a house like this? Well, no-one at . the moment. But the tiny two-bedroom bungalow is likely to be snapped up . by a Google software engineer - or by a canny landlord hoping to rent . it to one of them . Just an average middle-class American suburb... The area's property prices have risen in line with tech stocks . Property website Zillow boasts that the 'charming cottage' has just been completely renovated. But the million dollar asking price is not going on the bamboo floors and remodelled kitchen. What potential buyers will be paying for is the privilege of living in Mountain View, where property values have soared as Silicon Valley stock prices have exploded. And although reliable figures are hard to find, Google is reputed to lead the pack in doling out the big bucks to its software engineers and designers, with even interns earning a massive $6,000 a month. The £300billion dollar company's Googleplex headquarters also offers a range of on-site perks to employees, so that they need not even spend a penny of their healthy salaries on outside entertainments. So it's no suprise that the internet giant allegedly receives a resume every 25 seconds from job-seekers eager to join the Silicon Valley gravy train. Recently renovated: The front door of the bungalow opens into this living room with just-laid bamboo floors . Open plan living: A view of the living room from the opposite angle shows how it extends into the kitchen . All mod cons: The kitchen boasts granite worktops, plenty of cupboards and stylish brushed metal appliances . For those plaid short-sleeve shirts: Although on a Google salary you could probably afford a service wash . This is where the magic happens... Although it probably takes place via webcam . Deceptively spacious: The property's bathroom makes clever use of the limited space available . The washroom: Because just one bathroom is never enough these days, the developers have added a half one . However, that puts the ordinary, non-IT working residents of towns like Mountain View in a difficult position. 'There are more new money millionaires ride-sharing across California than ever before,' explains Valleywag's Sam Biddle. 'They pay cash. They move fast. They might dig the modesty of [a] quiet residential plot. They might want Zuckerberg-chic, not ostentation. 'This isn't a problem if you're a well-to-do software engineer, but for the rest of humanity, you're suddenly priced out.' And the situation is only likely to get more difficult. Zillow predicts that Mountain View house prices are likely to rise a further 7 per cent next year.","Wooden house is less than ten minutes drive from the Googleplex .

The US accounted for 29 per cent, followed by Canada . and Australia, and two-thirds were made by women. In a break with tradition, the news of the labour and the birth were also officially announced on Twitter. A tweet from Clarence House yesterday morning read: ‘Her Royal Highness .

Contagious excitement: The public outside Buckingham Palace after the offical easel was put by the gates announcing the birth of the baby boy . Photographer Jesal Parshotam, 24, alerted the world to the impending arrival of the royal baby when he spotted the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William go into the hospital just before 6am yesterday. An all-night stint watching the back entrance had ended in success and he broke the news via Twitter. London-based Mr Parshotam said: ‘I guess it’s the biggest scoop of my career’. However, he chose not to take any pictures of the couple, claiming it was out of respect. Either that or he left his lens cap on. Within hours of the Palace’s announcement that the Duchess had gone into . labour, the term ‘#royalbaby’ had become the most popular topic on the . UK site, while the words ‘Kate Middleton’ were a top discussion in the . US. At least seven topics relating to the royal baby jumped to the top of . the ‘trending’ list, and among the most popular was speculation over the . baby’s name.

More than 700 messages were posted within hours yesterday on the single . thread ‘Kate’s in labour: royal baby on way’. The website of the Left-wing Guardian newspaper was dominated by news of the royal baby yesterday – but offered republican readers a chance to avoid ‘royalist’ news.

A couple from Staten Island, New York, have been living an over-the-top fairy tale for the past five years - but all that changed Wednesday when the pair were indicted on charges of identity theft and corruption after bragging about their misbegotten riches on Facebook. Amanda Zieminski, known by her nickname 'Meme Zee,' worked for eight years as a nurse at the medical office of South Shore Physicians in Staten Island, where prosecutors say the 26-year-old stole personal information from patients that was used to order new debit and credit cards. Zieminski, her fiance, aspiring rapper Clyde 'C-Money CEO' Forteau, 29, and their three suspected accomplices allegedly used the misappropriated cards to withdraw nearly $700,000 in cash, which the couple used to buy high-end jewellery, premium tickets to sporting events and go on a romantic Disney World vacation. Scroll down for video . Outlaws: Amanda Zieminski (left), 26, and her fiance, 29-year-old Clyde Forteau (right) have been arrested and charged with identity theft for allegedly bilking nearly $700,000 from senior citizens . Fairy tale: Zieminski (right) posted a photo showing off her engagement ring after Clyde Forteau had proposed to her at Cinderella's castle in Disney World . And the accused thieved were not shy about their newfound wealth. Both Forteau and Zieminski have been bragging about their lavish lifestyle on social media sites. Officials say the 29-year-old suspect is seen in Facebook photos sitting in pricey seats at the 2012 Eastern Conference Finals between the Boston Celtics and Miami Heat and taking in a Jets game from field level, the Staten Island Advance reported. ‘Seeing so many homeless people on my way to work makes me realize how blessed I am,’ Zieminski wrote on June 28. A series of pictures and a YouTube video posted on Zieminski's page also show the couple living it up in Orlando, Florida, where Forteau had proposed marriage to the 26-year-old at Cinderella's castle. Co-defendants: Prosecutors say Jerome 'It'z Holly' Forteau (left), and Abdel 'Chips' Yousef (right) were part of the crime ring run by Jerome's older brother and his fiancee . Accomplice: A fifth suspect, Carmen Rivera, 52, is charged with identity theft and could face up to seven years in prison if convicted . Material evidence: Police seized more than 50 credit cards and more than 20 fake or stolen driver's licenses from the couple . Preying on the weak: Working as a nurse at South Shore Physicians in Staten Island in 2008, prosecutors say Zieminski stole about 80 patient files, targeting the elderly . 'I'm living a fairy tale!!' the blushing bride gushed in a Facebook post after the April proposal. For the high-flying couple, their charmed existence came to an abrupt end on Wednesday when Zieminski, Forteau, his 24-year-old brother, Jerome ‘It’s Holly’ Forteau; 25-year-old Abdel ‘Chips’ Yousef and 52-year-old Carmen Rivera, were hit with identity theft and dozens of other criminal counts. According to District Attorney Daniel Donovan, it all started in 2008 when Zieminski, who was working as a nurse at the Hyland Boulevard medical practice, stole about 80 patient files, deliberately targeting the elderly, and passed them on to her boyfriend. The suspects then used personal information like Social Security numbers to order debits cards, apply for credit cards and even file income taxes to steal their victims' tax refunds, according to prosecutors. In total, investigators believe the criminal ring swiped at least $675,000 from unsuspecting patients. The money went towards luxury items like baubles, cars, parties at exclusive clubs and expensive tickets to basketball and football games.

In December, Zieminski was fired from her job after she was caught inflating her work hours, but her fairy tale continued. On April 28, the woman announced her engagement to Forteau: 'Yesterday was the greatest day of my life. My love asked me to marry him in Cinderella's Castle, glass slipper and all.' An investigation into the suspected crime ring was launched in June 2012 when a victim’s TD Bank account address was switched from Staten Island to The Bronx, and a new debit card was ordered. Over the course of four days, someone had withdrawn just under $25,000 from the account. One of the transactions that raised a red flag was a purchase of front-row tickets to the NBA playoff game. Police traced the tickets to Clyde . Forteau's home in The Bronx, and they were later able to connect him to . Zieminski, who was his classmate and fellow student athlete at the New . York City College of Technology. Following . that discovery, investigators got a warrant to eavesdrop on Forteau and . Zieminski's cell phone conversations, which revealed that the suspects . targeted many of their victims based on age. Prosecutors . say that the 29-year-old aspiring hip-hop star had even pretended to be . a victim of Hurricane Sandy to explain his decision to move a bank . account address from Staten Island to The Bronx.

A search of Forteau's BMW 7 series car yielded more than 50 credit cards and more than 20 stolen and fake driver's licenses. Inside Zieminski's car, police discovered a jacket that her fiancé used to wear when withdrawing money from ATMs, police said. ‘Make no mistake, Amanda Zieminski is no Cinderella and Clyde Forteau is far from prince charming,’ Donovan said. ‘However, this story does have a fairy-tale ending — for law enforcement.’ The New York Daily News reported that Forteau is being held on $460,000 bail, while his bride has been booked into jail on $405,000 bail .

The man who set out to conquer Kilimanjaro with a nine-foot cuddly tiger strapped to his back has reached the highest peak in Africa. Paul Goldstein hauled the 30lb beast to an altitude of 19,341ft - just a few days after the two of them completed last Sunday's Brighton marathon. And as if that weren't enough, the 49-year-old is now preparing to carry his feline friend across the finish line in the London marathon tomorrow. Top cat: An overjoyed Paul Goldstein celebrates reaching the Uhuru peak of Kilimanjaro having made the ascent with a nine-foot cuddly tiger on his back . Earning his stripes: Mr Goldstein and his furry friend had to battle through snow and harsh conditions to summit the highest point in Africa . Mr Goldstein, a wildlife photographer and tour guide from Wimbledon, battled through heavy snow in the final stretch towards the Uhuru peak. His trio of gruelling feats forms a fundraising campaign to help save central India's Bengal tiger population. After a long descent on Thursday, he said: 'The Siberian Tiger is a sub species - however, yesterday some of that cold-weather tiger's DNA was in evidence on Kilimanjaro. In the worst conditions that anybody had ever experienced, the tiger summited.' He was due to fly back from Africa today to tackle the final stage of his three-part charity challenge. With his Worth More Alive III campaign, Mr Goldstein is hoping to raise more than £25,000 for Friends of Conservation, a charity which works with communities around the world to protect endangered species and habitats. Roaring success: The hardy fundraiser passes above the clouds on his way to an altitude of more than 19,000ft . Mr Goldstein, who ran four marathons in one week two years ago, had to complete the Brighton race in less than six-and-a-half hours to catch his flight to Africa. Having crossed the line after less than six hours last Sunday, he was whisked to Heathrow, where he jetted off to Tanzania to begin the five-day ascent of the world's highest free-standing mountain. The proceeds will go towards conservation projects in India's Bandhavgarh National Park. Mr Goldstein said hunters poach tigers for medicine and to profit from sales of their fur, teeth and claws, while the species is also losing its natural habitat due to industry destroying the forests where they live. Tough going: Paul Goldstein at the beginning of his ascent of Mt Kilimanjaro in Tanzania with a 30lb tiger on his back . Checking in: The tiger and Mr Goldstein board the Kenya Airways flight from London Heathrow to Nairobi . He said: 'Using tigers in traditional medicine is sheer lunacy. It has no value in any shape or form. 'Tigers could become extinct, but if we act now these beautiful animals are a species that can definitely be saved.' While there were around 100,000 . tigers in the wild a century ago, their numbers have plummeted due to . poaching and loss of habitat and there are now thought to be as few as . 3,500 left. One of the most important aspects of . the charity's work is to educate local people about the plight of . endangered animals and to stop predators such as tigers simply being . seen as the enemy. Mr Goldstein has raised £80,000 for . the cause previously, and all the money raised in his latest challenge . will go towards a compensation war chest for local farmers who have lost . cattle to the big cats. The value of a dead tiger is around . £12,000, according to the charity, but the value of a living tigress has . been calculated as £70 million in the revenue it will bring to a . reserve or park such as Bandhavgarh.

Lisa Harnum, above, died after falling from the 15th floor of an apartment in Sydney, Australia in 2011 . A witness in the murder trial of Simon Gittany, who is accused of throwing his ballerina fiancée from the balcony of a 15th floor apartment, told how he saw a shirtless man dropping a large 'object' into the street below, moments before Lisa Harnum was found dead on the pavement. Radio producer Joshua Rathmell was walking to work in Sydney when he looked up after hearing a 'deranged scream' come from the high rise building above. He then saw a man 'load' what he thought was a duffel bag over the balcony, before calmly walking back into the flat. Mr Rathmell, giving evidence at the Supreme Court in Sydney, said he was walking through the central Hyde Park when he heard the disturbance. He told jurors: ‘I heard what I thought was deranged screaming from a male voice. ‘My perception was that it was a male voice, very emotional, it sounded guttural.’ When he looked up he saw a man with no shirt carrying what appeared to be ‘black luggage'. He added: ‘It was being held horizontally in the man’s arms. His arms were outstretched with the object lying across. ‘I . saw the man load the object off the balcony and in what I described as a . fluid motion, turned and went straight back into the apartment. I didn’t . really follow the item.’ Mr Rathmell said that when he reached the corner of Liverpool and Elizabeth streets he realised it was a woman who had fallen. Terror: His hand clamped over her mouth to stifle her 'bone-chilling' screams for help, a shirtless Simon Gittany wrestles fiancee Lisa Harnam - minutes before she plunged 15-storeys to her death. The footage was captured on a pin-hole camera that he set up in the flat to spy on her . ‘I walked up to two labourers standing near the object and said “Mate, is that a body?”’ By the time he realised what had fallen, other bystanders were already trying to resuscitate Miss Harnum. Mr Rathmell said he later saw the man he thought had thrown the body walking out of . the apartment block. The witness said: ‘I . can’t 100 per cent clarify that the man I saw come out of the building . was the man on the balcony, but I instinctively thought that he was. At court: Gittany, 37, denies murdering Canadian-born Miss Harnam on July 30, 2011, claiming he was trying to stop her from jumping . ‘He was grieving or reacting very emotionally to what had happened.’ Mr Rathmell is seen as a key witness by prosecutors who allege that Gittany, 37, murdered his Canadian born fiance after an argument on the night of July 30, 2011. CCTV footage has shown Miss Harnum screaming as she left the front door of the apartment on the day of her death, before Gittany allegedly reached around her head, put his hand over her mouth and brought her back inside. The . 30-year-old's terrifying last moments were captured on a pin-hole . camera Gittany set up to spy on her every . move, the court heard. Gittany, has pleaded not guilty to murdering Miss Harnum, claiming he was trying to save her from suicide before she fell. He has been regularly accompanied to his trial by his current girlfriend. A neighbour, however, claimed he saw a topless man 'fist-pumping' on the terrace after something had gone over the edge, 9News reported. 'Of course, it was not a piece of . luggage, it was Miss Harnum wearing black clothing,' Crown prosecutor . Mark Tedeschi QC said today at Gittany's murder trial. Gittany was so jealous, Mr Tedeschi claimed, that he had banned her from seeing friends, . forbade her from taking a job as a hairdresser and even hired a personal . trainer to come to their home so she wouldn't go to the gym where he . thought she would be ogled by other men. Describing Gittany as 'controlling and abusive', Tedeschi said he made her become Catholic, do her hair and dress exactly how he told her. '[He believed] it was her function in life to submit to his will as the male in the relationship,' Mr Tedeschi said. But his vice-like grip over her life was still not enough, the court heard. Mr Tedeschi told jurors Gittany even set up a network of mini cameras around the apartment to keep tabs on her and secretly read her emails and text messages. It was because of this forensic campaign of surveillance that he caught wind of her plan to leave him with the help of two friends, the court heard. As a result he allegedly abused one of them over the phone, advising them to stay away. In the months leading up to her death, the court heard, Miss Harnum had become so fearful of her fiancé's jealous rage that, when she did venture outside, she only ever stared at the ground or into his eyes for fear he might accuse her of looking at other men. 'The deceased's confidence became more and more diminished,' Mr Tedeschi said. Giving evidence, Miss Harnum's . mother said told the court: 'She told me he was always very controlling . and wanted to always know where she was, what she was doing, who she was . with, what she was wearing.' She . said when Miss Harnum plucked up the courage to tell Gittany she was . leaving him, he threatened to destroy her chances of getting permanent . Australian residency - a dream she had harboured since moving to the . country. Reign of fear: In the months leading up to her death, the court heard, Miss Harnam had become so fearful of Gittany's jealous rage that, when she did venture outside, she only ever stared at the ground or into his eyes for fear he might accuse her of looking at other men . Gittany's defence barrister Philip . Strickland SC said Miss Harnum was a 'conflicted, complicated and . confused woman' prone to over-reacting when she didn't get her own way. Mr . Strickland said Gittany only monitored her text messages via a computer . programme because she had told him she had a secret that she couldn't . disclose to him. 'The secret ate into their relationship,' he said . Her fingerprints were not found . on the glass or metal rail of the balcony onto which he said she climbed . before she fell.

Wenger . believes in the scientific principles established at the Emirates, . although his team of scouts around the world still work to the formula . he brought with him in 1996. His . scouting team, headed by Steve Rowley, are asked to identify players . with three distinctive characteristics: pace, power and football intelligence. If only they had added a fourth — the mentality of champions — they really would be in business. The . dynamic training-ground environment, which was once the envy of the . world when Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and  Robert Pires were pushing . each other to reach new targets each day, has slowly been eroded. There . is tension in the air between Rowley and Bob Arber, Arsenal’s head of . youth. At games, they don’t even speak to each other. Glory days: Robert Pires and Dennis Bergkamp were iconic figures during Arsenal's success . They . should be in constant communication, preserving the future of the club . by monitoring the progress of young players at Arsenal’s academy and . bringing in the next generation. Instead, the young Gunners are on the . end of some hidings, losing 7-0 to Conference club Luton and beaten by a . scratch team of Colchester kids 5-1 before the start of the season. This is no way to run a football club and most people know that there is room for improvement in every area at Arsenal. Wenger has too much power — given the freedom of the football club because of his achievements at Highbury. There . he won three Barclays  Premier League titles, four FA Cups and took . Arsenal to within a whisker of beating Barcelona at the Stade de France . in 2006. He knows the inner workings of every area of the club, which is rare in the modern game. Spend, spend, spend: An Arsenal fan makes his feelings known to Wenger . Wenger’s . detailed knowledge of every player’s contract even created an issue . when Oxlade-Chamberlain was making substitute appearances for Arsenal . last season. Written into . the England winger’s deal is a clause stating that Arsenal must pay . Saints £10,000 every time Oxlade-Chamberlain appears for more than 20 . minutes. Incredibly a trend . emerged, with Wenger bringing him off the bench after 72 minutes (v . Stoke), 73  minutes (Liverpool), 72 minutes (Coventry), 65 minutes . (Norwich), 76 minutes (Fulham), 86 minutes (Tottenham), 67 minutes . (Swansea), 73 minutes (West Ham), 71 minutes (Swansea), and 75  minutes . (Reading). Arsenal’s . accounts department were stunned to receive an email from Southampton . demanding payment for the appearances, with the south coast club . justifying their argument based on stoppage time. Eventually . Arsenal agreed to pay for the appearances and the story worked its way . around the offices at the Emirates with bafflement among staff. They know Wenger calls the shots, but he is slow to move for targets. Slow: Arsenal were too late when it came to trying to sign Wilfried Zaha from Crystal Palace . Last . season Rowley was a regular at Crystal Palace matches, following . Wilfried Zaha around the country as Arsenal stepped up their interest. Rowley . would pop up at Leicester or Burnley, watching Zaha closely as Palace . headed for the play-offs and promotion back to the  Barclays Premier . League. When it came to the . crunch, Wenger’s assistant manager Steve Bould picked up the phone to an . old friend at Palace to ask for his assessment of the £15m forward. By then it was too late. Zaha had been given permission to meet Sir Alex Ferguson and the deal was wrapped up within a day. The . England winger is another one to get away, but everyone at Arsenal . knows that Wenger — a thoroughly charming and decent guy — has failed to . keep pace with the modern game. Managers need technical assistance and expertise, something the top clubs in the Premier League have finally accepted. Partnership: Jose Mourinho works with director of football Michael Emenalo to recruit players at Chelsea . At . Chelsea, Jose Mourinho has returned to Stamford Bridge on the . understanding that he must work closely with director of football . Michael Emenalo on transfer targets. Manuel .

David Bradley, 55, has been found guilty of misconduct after streaking naked with pupils on an outward bound school trip . A grammar school teacher who streaked in front of his pupils has quit his job after being found guilty of misconduct. David Bradley, 58, had been camping with the group of  12- and 13-year-olds on a field trip when he agreed to run naked across a garden. The married teacher told a disciplinary panel: ‘The lads had streaked for a joke and they were saying, “Come on sir, you have a go.” ‘At that point, for whatever reason, I got up, ran down the garden and ran back in. Even when I did it I thought, “What am I doing?”’ Bradley, who received an MBE four years ago for his work with children, was found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct this week after admitting it had been ‘inappropriate’ to streak. He has since quit his job and will hear in the next month whether he will be struck off the teaching register. The hearing was also told how he undressed in an area where children were showering during the school camping trip to the Solwaybank centre in Dumfries and Galloway in November 2011. Bradley, from Hale Barns in Greater Manchester, was also accused of inappropriately hugging a female pupil from North Cestrian Grammar School in Altrincham, Cheshire, where he taught. However, the Teaching Agency hearing in Coventry ruled that undressing in front of boys while they showered and hugging the girl, who Bradley said was hypothermic, did not amount to misconduct. Addressing the moment Bradley streaked in front of the children, panel chairman John Pemberton told him: ‘Teachers have a responsibility to uphold public trust in the profession and to maintain high standards of behaviour within and outside school. He also presided over a bizarre 'peeing' competition between students from North Cestrian Grammar School, Altrincham, Cheshire, on the camping trip between November 4 and 6, 2011 . Bradley, who taught English for 37 years, admitted he was 'out of date' and said he was 'aghast' that traditional teaching methods were now considered 'frightening' ‘On this occasion you failed to . maintain the appropriate boundaries and appropriate delineation  of . behaviour that should exist between pupils and teachers. ‘We are satisfied that your actions . do amount to unprofessional conduct which may bring the profession into . disrepute.’ The English master was awarded an MBE in 2008 for services . to young people after running schemes for the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award . for 30 years. He said at the time that organising . trips was ‘normally just an excuse to have fun and enjoy the animal . vitality the young exude’. Bradley, who has taught for 37 years, said he realised while streaking that what he was doing was unprofessional. ‘At the time and also shortly afterwards I realised it was inappropriate,’ he added. ‘I thought, “What the hell are you doing? I’ve not done this before –  why am I doing it now?”’ However, referring to the accusations . about hugging the girl,  Bradley said he was ‘aghast’ that what used to . be considered normal behaviour for teachers could now cause complaints. ‘The thing that comes out of this is how out of date I am,’ he said. ‘What is viewed as normal today seems . to have gone to a frightening situation where an adult can’t be near to . a child without being accused of something. I’m aghast.’ John Easton, representing Bradley, . added: ‘He made a very  serious error of judgment after working a . 16-hour day and suffering from fatigue.’","David Bradley, 55, also undressed in a shower area where children, aged 12 and 13, were naked .

A new generation of mollycoddled children are unable to cope in adulthood, David Cameron’s new adviser on childhood said last night. MP Claire Perry criticised the paradox of parents being over-controlling in their children’s lives, while at the same time giving them limitless access to the internet - where she says, the real dangers lie. Every moment of a child’s life is filled with organised activities, leaving young people unable to fend for themselves when they leave home or go to university, the 48-year-old mother of three said. Controlling: Parents fill their children's lives with organised activities, leaving young people unable to fend for themselves when they leave home or go to university, says MP Claire Perry. Picture posed by models . Yet at the same time, many children are given few restrictions when it comes to the internet. ‘We’ve created a treadmill,’ she said. ‘It’s usually the mother that is orchestrating all of that and doing all the driving. ‘We have created rods for our own back. Children need time to be bored.’ When discussing the internet, Mrs Perry, the Prime Minister’s adviser on the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood, told The Times newspaper: ‘Most parents are too busy, don’t know the words, aren’t aware their children are doing it. ‘They are living in digital oblivion,’ she said. Doing too much for the children: ' Children need time to be bored,' says the MP . Her remarks on parenting are in sharp contrast to those of many other politicians, who are more likely to praise parents’ efforts. The MP for Devizes, also criticised the sexism in political life, during an interview with The Times newspaper. Before she entered politics, Mrs Perry worked in the banking and finance industry, which despite its reputation for being chauvinistic, was far more meritocratic than British politics, she said. Mrs Perry took a seven-year break from her career in management consulting when her children were young but admitted that she was guilty of ‘hovering’ over them too much when she was at home. She said that when mother’s do too much for their children, they struggle when they leave home and realise they haven’t got a mother to help them with their homework, watching their every move. Critic:  Claire Perry is concerned about good parenting as David Cameron's special advisor . The new trend of 1950s-style homemaking has added to the burden on today’s mothers, she said. ‘We fetishise cupcakes ... I like baking but I don’t want to make that my life’s purpose. We worship this feminine motherhood thing and I don’t think our children have benefited actually. They’re babied a lot.’ Mrs Perry added that, despite the intense focus on children’s lives, parents were often afraid to lay down the law. ‘Good parenting isn’t just about making sure they come top in maths but all the difficult stuff too. If they don’t learn the limits from us who is going to tell them?’ Mrs Perry’s decision to criticise today’s parenting methods was criticised by some campaigners last night. Justine Roberts, co-founder of the Mumsnet forum told The Times: ‘Mothers are, sadly, used to copping a lot of blame but being charged with being over-protective, cupcake-baking helicopter parents at the same time as being feckless, couch potatoes who let their children have unfettered internet access is a bit rich. ‘Politicians could more usefully perhaps focus on improving local schools, job prospects, childcare options and flexible work solutions than telling us how to be better parents.’ Mrs Perry has been leading the Government’s campaign to persuade broadband providers and internet companies to adopt an ""opt in” filter, which would automatically block pornography and other adult content unless subscribers specifically request it.","Claire Perry says we have 'created a rod for our own backs'

But after their assembly last week, the pupils of Horsmonden Primary School in Kent certainly know all about some of his more memorable characteristics. They watched open-mouthed as their headmaster ‘snapped’ when the electronic organ he was trying to play refused to work. Enraged, Malcolm Hayes smashed and punched the keyboard before wrenching it off its stand and telling his pupils to follow him as he stormed outside. Temper: Head Malcolm Hayes, 49, is on sick leave after losing his cool with an electric organ during assembly . Once in the carpark the 49-year-old, a . devout Christian, smashed the instrument again – before jumping in his . car and repeatedly driving over it. The mother of one of the frightened . children compared Mr Hayes to John Cleese’s infamously short-tempered . character in Fawlty Towers. She said: ‘When my child came home . that day and told me what had happened, I couldn’t believe it. I called . around other parents to find out what had gone on. ‘But they were all saying the same . thing. It sounds like he’s had a complete breakdown in front of the kids . – it’s like he’s just gone mad. One minute he was playing the organ, . the next he’s smashing the keys and behaving really aggressively. ‘It’s a primary school, so some of the . children didn’t really understand if it was all part of some show, but . by the time he was revving his car and crushing the organ, a few were . quite scared.

Rhoxan Kenward. He was allowed to continue in his role . as headmaster at Horsmonden and has since married Rhoxan, now 28, with . whom he has two children. But neighbours said they believed Mr . Hayes had recently moved out of the family home, prompting speculation . that marital problems could have led to the outburst. It is understood several parents . complained to the school and an internal investigation has been launched . by the board of governors. Mr Hayes has since taken medical leave. Dis-chord: An electric organ, similar to the one Mr Hayes destroyed . One mother of a child who saw the incident said it reminded her of Basil Fawlty attacking his car with a tree .

But Mr Hayes embarked on an affair . with her. When it was discovered, he was arrested and suspended over . allegations of under-age sex. No charges were brought, however, as Mrs Hayes had already turned 16 and was no longer officially a foster child. Kent County Council said it was ‘providing support’.

The U.S. Navy veteran discovered unconscious in a Californian motel in February, who awoke with total amnesia and only able to speak Swedish, has flown to Sweden in a bid to rebuild his life. Michael Boatwright, 61, was reunited in Gothenburg on Tuesday with Ewa Espling, an old flame who he has not seen in almost 30 years and hopes spending time with her might trigger an avalanche of lost memories. 'I just want to be able to live a normal life and hopefully get my memory back,' Boatwright said Tuesday according to CNN. Reunion: Ewa Espling speaks to Swedish cameras after her emotional reunion with Michael Boatwright at Gothenburg airport on Tuesday . Hope: Michael Boatwright hopes his reunion with Ewa Espling in Gothenburg will allow his memories to come back . Like Old Times: After being apart since 1984 - Michael Boatwright and Ewa Espling begin to catch up on old times outside Gotherburg airport on Tuesday . Feeling like a stranger in his country because he didn't speak English, Boatwright's reunion with Espling came after she saw his story online and recognized his face. 'I think it's the best solution for Michael, because he can't speak English,' said Espling, who dated Michael while he worked as a designer in Sweden in the early 1980s before the split in 1984. 'To recover fully, I think he needs to come where he's safe and understands what's happening around him.' Espling has kindly arranged a place for Boatwright and she sees him daily in an attempt to help him recover a lifetime of memories. Amnesia: Michael Boatwright awoke to find he had no memory of his past life to date, could not recognize his own reflection and believed he was Swedish . 'Michael asked me, 'Why are you doing this for me?' Because I know Michael would have done the same thing for me. If he had found me in the papers. This is a very nice man with a very big heart,' Espling said to CNN. Diagnosed with dissociative amnesia, a rare psychiatric condition usually triggered by a traumatic event, Boatwright woke dazed and confused on February 28th in hospital earlier this year, unable to recognize his own face in the mirror. Speaking through an interpreter, he said his name was Johan Elk, but that clashed with the Social Security card, passport and veteran's medical card he was carrying - all which identified him as Michael Boatwright. Medical professionals appealed for help in solving the mystery of Boatwright, the only clues they had to his former life were a duffel bag, five tennis rackets, two cellphones, little cash, some old photographs and his identification. Former Life; Michael Boatwright served in the . U.S. Navy from 1971 to 1973 (left) and was carrying old photographs on . him when he was discovered in a Palm Springs motel room in February . Baffling: Michael Boatwright is pictured here with two women - one who is believed to be his wife and a little boy thought to be his son . No Recollection: This is one of the photographs which have failed to jog the memory of Michael Boatwright from his amnesia . But as Boatwright's mysterious and enigmatic story carried round the world, those who knew him came forward to offer up small pieces of his forgotten life. His sister said that she hadn't talked to him in ten years and that she couldn't even get in touch with him in 2012 when their mother had died. 'He’s always been just a wanderer. Then he’d come back when he needed some money or something from somebody. Then he’d take off again,' she said to The Desert Sun. Staff at Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs discovered through their own work that Boatwright was a 3D graphic designer who taught English in Japan for 10 years and then in China for four. Diving: Eva Espling submitted these photos, saying she knew Michael Boatwright in the 1980s. Boatwright, 61, is pictured in the diving helmet . Boat-Trip: Michael Boatwright served in the U.S. Navy in the 70s and here he is pictured in 1982 in Sweden in a picture taken by Ewa Espling . Last Hope: With no memories returning in the six months since he awoke in Palm Springs with total amnesia, Michael Boatwright is hoping that his Sweden trip will restore them - here he is in the early 1980s . A fellow English language teacher in Zhuhai, China contacted the center and offered a tantalizing glimpse into Boatwright's life before his catastrophic memory loss. Gifford Searls said he knew Boatwright when he worked at the the United International College, while Boatwright worked at the TPR English school. Searls said that Boatwright was a very good tennis player, spoke flawless English and was healthy. 'There was no inkling of any deep personal issues. He never talked about money. He didn't talk much about his past life,' Searls told The Desert Sun. 'And then there was this one Friday night where I get a phone call.' Boatwright was in trouble. All Searls could make out over the phone was his friend whispering for help. Relief: Michael Boatwright uses exercise as the only way to concentrate his mind and not think about his memory loss . Desert Regional Medical Center did all it could to identify relatives of Michael Boatwright - but now he has moved onto Gothenburg, Sweden . So he showed up at Boatwright's home with his wife and two other friends and found that the man they knew was living in a 'hovel' - a single-room basement apartment that had no bathroom. Boatwright was inside and unconscious with a glass of vodka and half a vial of animal tranquilizers next to him. Skeptical: Gifford Searls knew Boatwright back in China, and helped the man get back to the U.S. before his visa expired. He's not sure if the amnesia is real . He was rushed to the hospital and treated, eventually being released into his friend's care. During his time at Searls' house, Boatwright talked about his ex-wife in Japan, and how he had been 'cut off' from their son. Boatwright admitted that he couldn't go back to his job at the school and didn't know where to go next - his visa was set to expire. The TPN English school confirmed that Boatwright  quit in January and that he had an ex-wife in Japan. So Searls came up with an idea to send Boatwright to Palm Springs, California to look for a job as a tennis instructor. He had contacts at a local Marriott where Boatwright could try and get a job. Searls paid for Boatwright's one-way flight and gave his friend $400 to start a new life. Boatwright left China on February 24, the last day of his visa, and that was the last time that Searls heard from his friend. His current persona of Johan Ek, clashes with the Social Security card, passport and veteran's medical card he was carrying in February and following mental and physical health exams . Doctors at Desert Regional Medical Center have theorized that his total memory loss was triggered by some kind of emotional or physical trauma - what exactly that was though, they admit to drawing a blank on. 'He's kind of a blank slate,' said Lisa Hunt-Vasquez, the social worker assigned to track down relatives and help piece his life back together. For Boatwright, the sheer frustration and confusion of the whole ordeal is maddening. Former Life: Michael Boatwright worked as an English language teacher in China and Japan for almost 15 years . 'When I look at the photos, I see my ex-wife and my son ... my mother and grandmother, but I don't recognize them. I don't know them,' he said. 'Sometimes it makes me really sad and sometimes it just makes me furious about the whole situation.' For Boatwright, though, his daily life is a living hell. 'Walk in my shoes for one day,' he said. 'You'll experience the nightmare of a lifetime.' However, despite the international attention Boatwright's story has garnered, some are suspicious and doubt he has lost his memory. Searls for one, doesn't believe that Boatwright lost his memory. 'I just think here is a guy that has no place to go, is desperate and is broke. If he does this, at least he has a bed and three meals a day,' Searls said. 'He's reached the end of his line. But that's just a personal perception.' The Swedish-American community in Palm Springs also finds aspects of 'Johan Ek' questionable. They've been helping him adjust to his new reality at the Vasa Order of America's Desert Viking Lodge. Wife: This woman is believed to be an acquaintance in Japan - but she has not come forward to see Michael Boatwright . After five months of trying to dupe him into speaking English, he hasn't slipped once said his social worker Lisa Hunt-Vasquez. One of Boatwright's friends at the Vasa Order, Viola Wyler, does believe that Boatwright lived in Sweden during the mid-1980s, but he doesn't speak with a regional accent which is strange. Wyler says this could be because he learned the language later in life, or hasn't used it much during his adult life. Unable to remember how to speak English, Chinese, Japanese, or even work as a designer - the one thing that Michael still can do is to play tennis. He hopes to start work as a tennis instructor in Sweden as soon as he is on his feet. 'After death, this is probably the worst thing you could ever go through,' he said.","Michael Boatwright woke up in a Palm Springs Motel 6 in February with no memory of his past life .

They are thought to have leapt up to 30ft from a bridge at a spot that has become popular among teenagers for ‘tombstoning’. A witness said the girls, aged around 14, were part of a group who were daring each other to jump into the fast-flowing Wear in Fatfield, Washington, near Sunderland. Missing:  A desperate search is underway after Chloe Fowler, 13, left, and Toni-Beth Purvis, 15, right, went missing in the River Wear this afternoon. Police dive teams this evening recovered two female bodies . Two girls were seen in the water in the River Wear near Washington, Tyne and Wear this afternoon . But last night, police denied that the . girls had been tombstoning – a dangerous craze in which participants . jump into water from great heights. A spokesman said that nobody saw them jump from the bridge and it is unclear where they jumped from. Last night police said that the bodies . of both girls had been recovered from the Wear. The girls, named . locally as Chloe Fowler and Toni-Beth Purvis, disappeared under the . water at 3pm after witnesses saw the younger of the two struggling for . breath and the older one jumping in after her. It is thought a boy jumped in to help . them, followed by an off-duty police officer who was jogging nearby. The . officer dragged the boy to safety but was unable to find the girls. Police said a member of the public, . possibly the father of one of the girls, also swam across the river but . could not reach them. Around 100 rescue and emergency . service personnel, backed up by a police helicopter, hunted for the . girls, but last night the search was scaled down after two bodies were . found. Search teams were working on the banks of the river yesterday and recovered a body late last night . Boats were launched and emergency services staff were alerted to the incident just before 3pm yesterday . Superintendent Alan Veitch, of . Northumbria Police, said: ‘The parents are distraught and need a lot of . support and we are providing them with every assistance we can.’ He said the river was tidal up to a . point upstream from where the children went missing, and that there was a . lot of debris and foliage in the water. ‘Today was one of the hottest days of . the year, it’s the school holidays and it’s tempting to go in the . water,’ he added. ‘There are big, strong powerful river currents and . this is not the place to lark about.’ The bridge is over a wide stretch of . the river, which is lower than usual after the recent heatwave. A . witness, who is a neighbour of one of the girls, said: ‘There was a . group of about five older lads and they were daring the girls to jump . into the water. Missing: Eyewitnesses said the girls were jumping from the jetty into a relatively slow-flowing stretch of the river . ‘At that point the river was very low . which meant they were jumping from about 20 or 30 feet, about the height . of a two-storey house. It’s really murky and they just disappeared . under.’ Locals said the currents in the river were notoriously strong and several others have drowned there. Witnesses said they thought the member of the public who dived in may have been one of the girls’ fathers. Paul Cronin, 63, said: ‘This gentleman came running up towards the park dressed in his boxer shorts. ‘He had just crawled out of the river and had nearly drowned himself. He was screaming at me, “Can you swim?”.’ Mr Cronin went to the river with the . would-be rescuer, but when he got there he saw no sign of the girls. ‘By . the time I got there it was too late,’ he said. ‘Some of the kids had . been messing around and threatening to push each other in.’","Girls named locally as Chloe Fowler, 13, and .

Roseanna Langley, 24, bombarded the 16-year-old with hundreds of texts and naked photos during the six-week affair . A woman teacher who had an illicit relationship with a 16-year-old pupil was spared jail yesterday despite a judge telling her that she had groomed the boy for sex. Roseanna Langley, 24, sent hundreds of explicit text messages and photographs to the pupil’s phone, took him away to London for a romantic weekend and even lied about being pregnant in order to prolong the affair. The science teacher’s text messages included ‘Baby please let me tie you up tomorrow it’s so sexy’ and ‘babe I love planning our future together’. She told the boy she planned to have his name tattooed on her body and discussed getting married, buying a dog and having children together. Exeter Crown Court heard that she had abused her position of trust to spark a sexual relationship with the boy between January and March, shortly after her engagement to another man had ended. Pupils at the school became aware of the relationship after Langley invited students to her house to watch films. They said she and the boy kissed and cuddled before going to her bedroom. Among the 1,500 texts the pair exchanged was an assurance from Langley that she ‘didn’t care if she got sacked so long as they could be together’. Last month, Langley, from Exeter, pleaded guilty to two offences of sexual activity with a male aged 13 to 17 while in a position of trust. Explicit messages: Two of the text messages sent by teacher Roseanna Langley to her 16-year-old pupil asking him to let her tie him up and telling him how she loves 'planning our future together' Despite claiming the relationship was . over, she was arrested this week after being spotted in a car with the . teenager.

Lindsay Lohan's long journey to rehab took a bizarre twist on Thursday - when the actress changed her mind about checking in to a treatment facility at the last minute. Lohan was scheduled to enter rehab on Thursday morning to begin her 90 days of court-ordered treatment. But the troubled starlet is reported to been 'spooked' by the amount of paparazzi waiting outside the Morningside Recovery in Newport Beach, and refused to check into the facility. Law enforcement sources now tell TMZ . that prosecutors will seek an arrest warrant for Lindsay Lohan if she's . not back in rehab by sunrise. On the run: Lindsay Lohan has failed to enter the rehab facility as ordered by the court and is at risk of being arrested again . Checking in: According to reports Lindsay entered the California centre at 8.45am to start her 90 day stint . Under fire: It has been claimed that Morningside Recovery cannot offer treatment after its licence was revoked . Lindsay's whereabouts are currently unknown. A source told Radar that Lindsay has apparently been saying for the past six hours that she is 'going to return to the rehab facility but she hasn't yet.' 'She felt Morningside was not suitable for her,' another source told Us Weekly about Lindsay's decision to leave. 'There were too many paparazzi everywhere and she didn't feel safe. 'Nobody close to her is happy about this. They think she's really not being smart.' Lindsay's decision to leave rehab came while her lawyer Mark Heller was in court telling a judge that she had entered the facility at 8.45am. Mixing things up: Lindsay is reportedly unhappy with her lawyer Mark Heller's progress with the case, and has hired back her former lawyer Shawn Holley . Could face arrest: Lindsay’s failure to check in to the facility is likely a violation of her recent plea deal . Lindsay's . SUV arrived at the California facility but the vehicle left with Lindsay still inside, according to TMZ. RadarOnline, however, reports that Lindsay did in fact walk through the doors of the facility, but left just a few minutes later. 'She told people there that she didn't need rehab,' a source told Radar. 'And then she left. Everyone was stunned.' Lindsay's father Michael also confirmed to Radar that his daughter never checked in. 'I have no other choice than to get this out there to help Lindsay,' he said. Backing out: An image has been released which appears to show Lindsay and her luggage arriving at the facility . Retail therapy: At 8.45am, 15 minutes after she was due to check into her rehab facility, Lindsay was seen shopping at Fry's electronics store . Lindsay was spotted at a Fry's Electronics store . in Fountain Valley at 8.45am, while at the same time her lawyer . Mark Heller was in court asserting she had already checked into rehab. After refusing to check into . Morningside, Lindsay allegedly insisted on being taken back to the . airport because she wanted to fly to New York. 'She was saying, ""I'm not going to rehab. I'm not going to rehab. Take me back to the airport,""' a source told The New York Daily News. But Lindsay's desire to return to New York is likely a violation of her recent plea deal, which could lead to an arrest warrant being issued. Orange County's finest: Police were seen surrounding Morningside as Lindsay checked in . 'If . there’s credible confirmation she’s heading back to New York, then I’m . going to have to go in and ask the court to issue a warrant,” Santa . Monica City Attorney Terry White said. And the actress' father Michael told Radar: 'If . that’s the case I have been told that she will be arrested in New York . and her bail will be set at $100,000.' Michael also told the Daily News that . he had spoken to Lindsay before the flight to New York took off, . pleading with her not to get on it. 'She said, ""Daddy, how can they arrest me?"" I got her just before she left,' said Michael. Staying put: The Liz & Dick star will stay in the California facility until a decision has been made by the court . Final moments of freedom: On Wednesday Lindsay spent her last day before rehab shopping and chain-smoking . And in a bid to avoid an arrest . warrant being issued, Lindsay is reported to have re-hired the lawyer . she sensationally fired earlier this year. TMZ reports that Lindsay has been unimpressed with Heller's work on her case, and pleaded ith Shawn Holley to return. According to the website, Holley . agreed to return as Lindsay's lawyer, and has since been talking to . prosecutors in a bid to avoid them issuing a warrant for the actress' arrest. As well as telling the judge that . Lindsay had already checked into rehab, Heller also had to plead with . the judge to get the okay that Morningside would be a suitable facility . for the actress to complete her treatment in. Revoked: The Newport Beach rehab centre allegedly can only act as a sober living facility and treat outpatients . Lindsay had originally been scheduled . to complete her 90-day treatment at the Seafield rehabilitation . facility in New York after pleading no contest to charges of lying to police about driving . during a car crash last June, but Michael appeared to have put the actress off . the rehab centre. 'I . told her it’s like a motel, and you share a room and have a plastic . shower curtain. You can’t smoke, you can’t leave the property. She said, . “What?!’” he told The New York Daily News. Going to a different centre unapproved by the court technically broke her plea agreement, meaning the . star’s attorney was required to appear before a judge. Heller, who wore an eyesore of a tie in . red and black stripes for the hearing, was attempting to convince Judge James R Dabney . to approve of the switch. Lindsay's living quarters: The rehab facility features quaint interiors, as this photograph reveals . In and out: Lindsay allegedly left the plush rehab facility after 'a few minutes' He argued that as Lindsay has already . entered and is ‘ensconced’ in the program, it could effect her recovery should she have to move facilities. ‘She's . going to be meeting with a psychiatrist later today,’ Heller explained, . reinforcing that the star is ‘commencing immediate treatment.' The . news comes amid claims that the centre in fact does not even have a . licence to offer residential treatment as it was revoked in May 2012. According . to TMZ, Morningside had their licence suspended after they were found . to be careless with prescription drugs and went beyond the constraints . of the licence. Starting off on the right foot: Heller claims that Lindsay will be meeting with a psychiatrist later in the day . Looking out for Lindsay: Mark told Judge James R. Dabney that it would be a bad idea to move his client already . The Deputy Director of Licensing and . Certificates at the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs . told the website: ‘Morningside cannot give any treatment,’ as the rehab . centre is allegedly only allowed to provide a sober living facility. But . Morningside Recovery released a statement on Thursday claiming the . facility does in fact have a licence to provide drug and alcohol . treatment. The facility's . CEO Mary Helen Beatificato said the 2011 revocation of Morningside's . licence only hinders the centre's ability to provide detox services to . residents. The . judge however didn’t seem to have too many qualms about the switch to . that particular facility, despite the fact that it was not on a list . of six centres approved by the court. Convincing: Lindsay chose a rehab centre which was not approved by the court so Mark was attempting to get the judge to OK the decision . Fighting his corner: The switch to a different rehab technically violates Lindsay's plea agreement and now the centre must be approved . ‘It . does appear to comply,’ Judge Dabney said, adding that the prosecution . had eight days to decide whether or not they will agree with the centre . being approved. ‘I don't have any problems with Miss Lohan remaining in this program until the issue is resolved,’ he said. ‘If . we decide the program does not meet the requirements of the plea . agreement then she will have to move to a different program.’ He . explained: 'The issue is going to be whether or not we need to set a . hearing because the people are complaining [the centre] does not fit the . parameters.' Heller and . Terry White of the prosecution will reconvene in front of the judge on . May 10, at which point it will be determined whether or not they will . set a date for a restitution hearing. Lindsay's lawyer said he has faith . that Morningside would be approved, even though White claimed he had . three separate news articles which showed the facility in a bad light. '90 days and 270 looks': Lindsay posted a picture of herself packing for her stay in rehab on Instagram on Tuesday night . 'If [White] says he's satisfied then I . don't think we have to come back,' Heller said, adding, 'I'm 100% sure . he will be satisfied.' Heller . then claimed that he will 'make sure [Lindsay] stays in therapy', and . had called in the COO of Morningside in the hope that she could win over . White. The judge later stated that Lindsay will not have to appear in court as the case continues 'as long as she is in compliance'. In . addition, none of the star's progress reports are to be released to the . public aside from 'proof of completion' at the end of her stay.","Actress said to have 12 hours to return to rehab, or a warrant will be issued for her arrest .

The unstoppable Duck Dynasty is on course to snatch cable TV's ratings record from The Walking dead after 11.8 million viewers tuned in to watch the start of the new season. The boss of A&E Network's is cautiously optimistic that the hilarious exploits of a Louisiana family and their duck merchandise business still has plenty of room to grow. With some 'fun episodes coming down the pike', the show needs just 600,000 more viewers to equal current record holder, zombie fest The Walking Dead, which recorded the highest ever ratings for a show of any kind when 12.4 million people tuned in earlier this year. Scroll down for video . Dynasty: The show's stars (from left) Phil Robertson, Jase Robertson, Si Robertson and Willie Robertson . Big guns: The stars of Duck Dynasty are competing with scripted shows such as The Walking Dead . The business: The hilarious exploits of the Robertson family are on course to break all records for cable TV . A&E Network's general manager and executive vice-president David McKillop was reported by Today as saying: 'I’m a superstitious man so I don’t make (ratings) predictions. 'But do I think we’ve found the ceiling yet? I don’t know, but I don’t think so. We have some fun episodes coming down the pike. So keep your seat belt fastened.' Last week's ratings put Duck Dynasty at the top of the pile for highest ever audience tuning in to watch an unscripted show. The record was previously held by TLC's Jon & Kate Plus 8, which claimed 10.6 million viewers back in 2009. But with 6.3 million viewers in the coveted 18-49 age group, and a total increase of 37 per cent on the third season's premiere, Duck Dynasty's rise looks set to continue. Popular: Characters such as Uncle Si have helped establish the show as a firm favourite in American households . The show first aired in March 2012 and . averaged 1.3 million viewers, according . to data provided by Nielsen. By the time the third series drew to a close an average of 8.4 million had tuned in. According to Mr McKillop, part of the show's appeal lays in the clean living Christian values of the Robertson family, who live in the backwoods of West Monroe. Their feet remain firmly on the ground, despite amassing a fortune from their duck sporting empire, Duck Commander. The firm specialises in top-of-the-range duck calls and decoys, made from swamp wood, and employs many local people.

Part of their charismatic charm lies in their wish to stay grounded by keeping their guns and beards no matter how wealthy they become. And while their arguments are often hilarious, they never swear. Mr McKillop said: 'Hijinx is a word that I use to describe the kind of zeitgeist of their compound.

Female athletes believe the development of breasts could seriously hinder their careers - and could even prevent them from reaching Olympic standard. And some are going to drastic lengths to remove them - or even to stop them developing in the first place. According to ESPN magazine, gymnasts push themselves to the 'brink of starvation' to avoid developing breasts and a host of professional athletes have spent a lot of money to surgically reduce them. 'For the modern athlete, the question isn't whether breasts get in the way -- it's a question of how to compete around them', the magazine reports. While there's no suggestion that U.S. gymnast Alicia Sacramone has any qualms, many gymnasts are pushed to be as breastless for as long as possible to help their career . ESPN writer Amanda Hess cites female Ultimate Fight Championship competitor Ronda Rousey's fight in February as a perfect example of a female athlete being hindered by her breasts. As soon Rousey flipped her opponent to the floor, she notes that she quickly rushed to adjust her sports bra straps - a move that ended in disaster. 'I got kicked straight in the chest right as I was trying to adjust my bra,' Rousey told Hess. 'You don't see big titties in the Olympics, and I think that's for a reason,' she added. Joan Ryan, author of the 1995 expose . of gymnastics and figure skating, Little Girls in Pretty Boxes, wrote . that elite gymnasts would undereat and overtrain to delay menstruation. 'You can't afford to have a woman's body and compete at the highest level,' she said. Dominique Moceanu, who at 14 was the youngest competitor on the 1996 gold medal USA Olympic team . added: 'The sport pushes us to be breastless little girls as long as . possible. But though breasts were forbidden, privately we longed for . them.' Legends surrounding women's breasts affecting their sporting prowess have circulated for years. One such legend suggests that female Amazons cut off the right breast to hurl spears and shoot arrows more efficiently. In 1995, a controversial CBS golf analyst called Ben Wright told a newspaper that 'women are handicapped by having boobs. It's not easy for them to keep their left arm straight. Their boobs get in the way.' And Wright may have a point. Judging by the latest research, women do seem to be held back - especially by larger breasts. A third of women taking part in the 2012 London Marathon with cup sizes ranging between . AA-HH reported breast pain from exercise; eight per cent even said the pain . was 'distressing, horrible or excruciating'. A typical A-cup breast weighs 0.43 of a pound and every additional cup size adds another 0.44 of a pound, according to research. It has also been found that the nipples of a woman who has C- or D-cup breasts can accelerate up to 45 mph in one second: faster than a Ferrari. Ronda Rousey (left) has spoken out to say: 'You don't see big titties in the Olympics, and I think that's for a reason' Paul Banwell, Consultant Plastic Surgeon, McIndoe Surgical Centre, East Grinstead, has treated a number of elite athletes and sportswomen with this very problem. He says that large breasts are associated with a whole host of health issues including back and neck pain, skin rashes and bra straps digging in. It can also lead to poor posture and low self-esteem, which can affect an athlete's performance. 'Over the years I have treated many elite athletes in a variety of sporting disciplines including hockey players, runners and female footballers'. 'Breasts can weigh a lot so they really can physically get in the way. 'Many athletes want to maintain their womanly figure but also reduce discomfort so it is a compromise and this must be discussed carefully with every patient,' he adds. It has been found that a woman who . has a C- or D-cup breast's nipples can accelerate up to 45 mph in one . second, which is faster than a Ferrari . Dr Puneet Gupta, Cosmetic Doctor at The . Private Clinic of Harley Street, the first doctor in the UK ever to . offer a non-surgical technique for breast reductions said: 'For professional athletes who maintain intense training regimes, these problems will of course be felt far more heavily. 'Training for long hours each day will only intensify the discomfort, meaning the size of their breasts won’t just get in the way of them exercising, but it can also affect their downtime away from sport, because it may take longer for them to rest and recover if they are still in pain in the back and breast areas. 'Over the years the inability to exercise or take part in sport has certainly become a more commonly cited reason for patients I see who are seriously considering undergoing a reduction. Dr Gupta says that medical advancements may also have contributed to the growing number of female athletes undergoing breast reductions. 'Now there are non surgical breast reduction methods that exist, which can allow women to undergo a reduction with very limited downtime. 'For females who train regularly or are actively involved in sport, but are being prevented from doing so because of the size of their breast, a minimally invasive reduction technique could be a feasible solution, reducing the amount of time they would need to take away from sport to recover. Protest: South African beach volleyball player Alena Schurkova launched a big-boob-pride campaign after Simona Halep (pictured) announced she was having her breasts reduced from a 34DD to a 34C because they were slowing her reaction time . He does, however, warn of the dangers of breast reduction in young athletes, many who are under the age of 25. 'It’s important to note though that a breast reduction won’t be suitable for everyone. It is actually a procedure which is most suited to post-menopausal women, so a very young athlete, for example, might not be suitable for treatment,' he adds. South African beach volleyball player .

Parents and pupils are furious after a religious studies GCSE textbook was discovered to be littered with errors - including a caption that identifies a picture of a Muslim as a Jew. Staff at JFS (formerly known as Jews' Free School) in Kenton, North West London, have had to issue a four-page list of corrections to the 300 pupils using the book to prepare for their exam. The AQA GCSE Religious Studies A: Judaism, produced for the exam board by educational publishers Nelson Thornes, has been branded 'offensive' and 'laughably bad'. Hard to study: The textbook, left, has been slammed for being 'confused' and misleading' for pupils. Right, a picture from the textbook of a kneeling Muslim labelled as a Jew . It not only includes a picture of a Muslim kneeling in prayer described as a Jew - who do not kneel to pray - but also shows a picture of a family 'celebrating Shabbat', when in fact they are having a Passover Seder meal. Shabbat, or Sabbath, is a weekly day of rest and spiritual enrichment and the most important ritual observance in Judaism, while the Passover Seder is a Jewish ritual feast that marks the beginning of the Jewish holiday, conducted on one or two evenings in March or April, on the 14th and 15th day of Nisan in the Hebrew calendar. The blunders are especially embarrassing for AQA after it was accused of 'justifying' anti-semitism in schools in May of this year, when one of its exam papers asked GCSE . pupils to explain 'why some people are prejudiced . against Jews'. One pupil said: 'It was so bad, the teacher kept telling us, ""don't listen to this, ignore this, half of this is wrong"".' The mother of a JFS pupil told the Jewish Chronicle: 'The textbook contains countless errors and general, confused assertions about Judaism. The factual errors are laughably bad. Clanger: The textbook says that this family is celebrating Shabbat, when in fact they are having their Passover seder meal . 'A section headed ""Reform Judaism"" in . fact talks about the practice of Orthodox Jews. A picture of a person . kneeling in prayer, described as a Jew, is in fact a Muslim. 'Other . assertions in the text, including commentaries on women who wear wigs, . and why Jews think they do what they do, are misleading and offensive'. AQA has become infamous for errors in its exam questions and marking. It is a concern for pupils battling to get the best grades possible in GCSE and A-level exams: . (2010) (2011) (2012) She claimed that JFS had to contact AQA to confirm that if students used the correct information about Judaism it . would not be marked incorrect by examiners because it did not tally . with the information in the textbook. Religious studies GCSE is a compulsory exam at many schools and a new textbook is now in production. A spokesperson for AQA said: 'AQA doesn't publish textbooks. We do liaise with publishers to try to ensure references to our syllabus are accurate; however the publisher is responsible for the content of the book and, therefore, any errors. 'JFS brought the errors to our attention and we raised them with the publisher. This book is being reprinted by the publisher and we have asked them to address these concerns. 'The reprinted book will no longer carry the confirmation that it covers our syllabus, because of the serious level of concern we have flagged to the publishers about their errors.' The school's headteacher, Jonathan Miller, said he had worked closely with AQA over the past year and was pleased there would be a new draft of the textbook. Steven Mintz, the head of Jewish studies at Manchester's King David High School, confirmed that he had co-written the textbook, but declined to comment further. This is not the first time AQA has come under fire for its association with mistakes that could affect pupils' exam grades. In the summer of 2010, 13 A-level students missed out on university places after marking errors by the exam board left them with lower grades than they should have received. The errors occurred when a failure with AQA's online system meant that not all of students' material was marked, an inquiry found. The awarding body was criticised for not piloting its system properly, and for a delay in reporting the problem to exam regulators - meaning students were got given the university places they deserved. In June 2011, thousands of pupils sat an AQA GCSE Maths test in which two-thirds of the questions were identical to ones they had answered in a paper just three months earlier. This year, there were complaints over an 'unfair' AQA English language GCSE, after pupils who took the exam in January found it easier to gain C grades than those who sat it in the summer.","Exam board-approved textbook gets key facts about religion wrong .

Rapist: The unnamed victim from Massachusetts was aged 14 when raped at her home in 2009 by Jamie Melendez (left), 24, who was then 20, before she became pregnant and eventually gave birth to his child . But last year Melendez filed a petition in a family court to argue that he should have visitation rights if he is forced to pay child support to the girl. She is expected to now have to fight this in family court. He also offered to no longer request these rights if the child maintenance order was made void. His victim was a middle school student at the time of the attack but recently graduated from high school. The girl’s lawyer Wendy Murphy criticised the original decision to force Melendez to pay child support as ‘outrageous’ and said it framed his behaviour as something ‘other than a serious crime’. She told ABC: ‘My client is very worried she'll have to send her daughter off to this man she doesn't know, and tell her she'll be going off on visits with the man who raped her mother and created her. ‘She wants nothing to do with this guy. She doesn't want a 16-year relationship with him.’ Attack: Melendez - who had known the victim for three years before the attack - had gone to the girl's house when he knew her mother would not be home, and pressured her into having sex with him . The attorney added that the girl is concerned about . risking losing the custody of her child if she does not participate in . the family court proceedings.

Education secretary Michael Gove is planning to introduce changes to the A-level system in the next stage of his overhaul of the examination system, it was claimed last night. Mr Gove is said to be developing an Advanced Baccalaureate which would see students studying a mixture of A-level subjects, writing a 5,000-word essay and undertaking voluntary work. The plans are being developed soon after Mr Gove announced he would scrap GCSEs in core subjects and replace them with tougher new exams. If his proposals are enacted it would mean the entire exam system for secondary schools will have been replaced in the space of thee years. The new baccalaureate system would require A-level students to study ‘contrasting’ subjects to give them a broad education, The Times reported last night. A candidate who chose A levels in maths, further maths and physics, for example, would be expected to pick a humanity, such as history or French, as a fourth subject. Mr Gove also wants shorter and more open-ended questions in exams. One option he is apparently considering is to limit the A-Bacc to teenagers who choose at least two A levels from a list of subjects specified by Russell Group universities - maths, further maths, English literature, physics, biology, chemistry, geography, history, and modern and classical languages. Universities want to keep the present system in which candidates typically study four AS levels, with grades awarded after a year, and continue with three subjects for a final year, known as A2, which together comprise a full A level. AS-level grades are widely used by universities to select applicants for admissions offers. But some academics want the Education Secretary to restore traditional A levels with exams at the end of the course. Changing times: The reform would see students studying 'contrasting' subjects, writing a 5,000 word essay and doing voluntary work . They say many undergraduates arrive at university unprepared for intensive study, especially in maths and physics. The A-Bacc would be based loosely on the International Baccalaureate diploma but would keep the subject specialism of A levels. They would also undertake voluntary work alongside their academic studies. From 2015, GCSEs in core subjects will be replaced with new exams called the English Baccalaureate Certificate. The E-Bacc has been controversial, with many teachers saying that it is too prescriptive. Labour are planning a Technical Baccalaureate or ‘Tech Bacc’ for 18-year-olds, involving technical qualifications alongside GCSEs and a programme of work experience. The Department for Education last night stressed that A-levels were not going to be scrapped, but conceded that discussions were ongoing about plans to reform further education. A spokesman said: ‘A-levels will not be replaced under any circumstances. There are public consultations about reforming A and AS levels. ‘There are also numerous suggestions about new ABacc league table measures but no decisions have been made.’","New Advanced Baccalaureate would see .

Rupert Murdoch has backtracked on secretly-recorded claims that police probing the illegal payments scandal were 'totally incompetent' Rupert Murdoch yesterday condemned the police inquiry into phone hacking as ‘excessive’ and ‘disproportionate’ and said it had ‘gone on too long’. The media tycoon condemned the way journalists have been subjected to dawn raids that have ‘terrified’ their families and been made to wait for up to 18 months to hear if they would be charged. The News Corp boss voiced frustration with the Scotland Yard investigation in two letters yesterday to House of Commons home affairs and culture, media and sport select committees. He was asked to explain himself after he was secretly recorded in March saying – when he met News of the World and Sun journalists arrested over allegations of phone hacking and paying public officials – that the police investigation has been ‘totally incompetent’. A transcript revealed that he had described the treatment of journalists who had been arrested as a ‘disgrace’. In a letter to Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs committee, Mr Murdoch admitted he had used the ‘wrong adjectives’ to describe his frustration. But he added: ‘I do question whether, over the last two years, the police have approached these matters with an appropriate sense of proportion, and with regard for the human cost of delay.

Scientists think they have solved the mystery of why some rogue planets exist in space without orbiting a star. Astronomers from Sweden and Finland believe orphan planets with no parent star can form in tiny, cold dust clouds in space. Research has shown there could be as many as 200 billion 'free-floating' planets in our galaxy alone. The Rosette Nebula (pictured) is a huge cloud of gas and dust 4,600 light years from Earth which harbours hundreds of 'globulettes (inset). Orphan planets with no parent star can form in tiny, round dark clouds that are flying through space at 80,000 kilometres per hour, scientists believe . Until now it was assumed that such 'rogue planets' must have been ejected from their solar systems. But new observations point to the likelihood of some free-floating worlds forming on their own. Astronomers used several telescopes to observe the Rosette Nebula, a huge cloud of gas and dust 4,600 light years from Earth in the constellation of Monoceros, the Unicorn. The nebula is home to more than 100 of the unusual planet-forming clouds, dubbed 'globulettes'. Each has a diameter less than 50 times the distance between the Sun and the planet Neptune. Dr Carina Persson, from Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, said: 'We found that the globulettes are very dense and compact, and many of them have very dense cores. 'That tells us that many of them will collapse under their own weight and form free-floating planets. The most massive of them can form so-called brown dwarfs.' Brown dwarfs, sometimes called failed stars, are bodies whose mass lies between that of planets and stars.

The nebula is home to more than 100 of the unusual planet-forming clouds, dubbed 'globulettes' The tiny clouds are speeding outwards through the Rosette Nebula at around 80,000 kilometres per hour, the astronomers found. Their results are published in the latest edition of the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. Co-author Minja Makela, from the University of Helsinki in Finland, said: 'We think that these small, round clouds have broken off from tall, dusty pillars of gas which were sculpted by the intense radiation from young stars. 'They have been accelerated out from the centre of the nebula thanks to pressure from radiation from the hot stars in its centre.' The scientists believe countless millions of nebulae such as the Rosette have bloomed and faded away during the Milky Way’s long history. Many could have given birth to free-floating planets. Professor Gosta Gahm, from Stockholm University in Sweden, who led the research, said: 'If these tiny, round clouds form planets and brown dwarfs, they must be shot out like bullets into the depths of the Milky Way.' 'There are so many of them that they could be a significant source of the free-floating planets that have been discovered in recent years.'","Astronomers used several telescopes to observe the Rosette Nebula, a huge cloud of gas and dust 4,600 light years from Earth .

"By . Esther Rantzen . PUBLISHED: . 19:39 EST, 19 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:11 EST, 20 August 2013 . For decades it was a closely guarded secret, one I only shared with my closest friends and family. Then, last week, I was horrified to discover that I’d been outed in a gossip column. A former colleague revealed that when I hosted a That’s Life! reunion, all the guests had to bring their own food. Not because it was a ‘pot luck’ dinner, where everyone brings a dish, nor because I’d had a domestic emergency that meant I couldn’t bake, but because I am a truly terrible cook. Esther Rantzen: 'For years I have gone to great lengths to hide my kitchen catastrophes' You can imagine my humiliation. After all, for years I have gone to great lengths to hide my kitchen catastrophes. Many times I’ve been invited to take part in Come Dine With Me, but have always refused because I didn’t want to admit that my favourite recipe is ‘pierce film and wait for ping’. If I invite any of my children to have a cosy supper with me, they only accept on condition it’s a takeaway. While I’m consoled that Victoria Beckham has now admitted she, too, is hopeless in the kitchen (despite cookery lessons from none other than Gordon Ramsay), it’s certainly never been more embarrassing to admit your culinary career peaked when you learned to boil an egg. We live in an age when TV listings are stuffed with people pan-frying and marinading, kneading and poaching, julienning and fileting. Celebrities cook. Nonentities cook. Hairy bikers and elegant old ladies cook. How could I possibly confess that I cannot cook? That rather than MasterChef, I am Disaster Chef. Victoria Beckham admitted one fo her greatest extravagances is hiring a personal chef, who cooks breakfast, lunch and dinner for the Beckhams three days a week. In an interview with Vogue Australia, the 39-year-old also admitted that her chef is required to make gourmet meals which are then put in the freezer - her best friends Gordon and Tana Ramsay have even tried to teach her to cook . And now the Great British Bake Off hype is back — the new series only begins tonight but shops are apparently already running low on mixing bowls and rolling pins — I am seriously considering emigration. Britain was so different when I was young. We Brits used to take pride in our Spartan approach to food. How well I remember wartime meal ordeals, like egg-powder omelettes and spam rissoles. After World War II, British food became famous around the world for over-cooked vegetables floating in water, black pudding and suet roly-poly. At school, I was taught how to cook ‘white stew’ made out of something called ‘scrag end’ (I can’t imagine which bit of the body it was, and what animal it could ever have belonged to) and ‘apple dumplings’, which were far more dumpling than apple. I have never attempted either since. In fact, cookery lessons put me off the whole process for life. My late mother did her best to reverse the damage. She was what used to be called ‘a plain cook’ — which meant no frills. In her case, it meant no flavour either. Although I do remember that her roast potatoes had a unique taste of laundry. I never knew why, until my sister told me she’d peel them days in advance, and keep them in a saucepan of cold water until needed. But I think it was the same saucepan she boiled our face-flannels in once a month to clean them. The one dish she excelled at was rice pudding, with delicious brown skin. But after eating rice puddings for ten years, out of sheer boredom I decided to try something new. I found a recipe for coffee mousse, persuaded Mum to let me try it out at a family party, and arranged it prettily in little glass dishes. Unfortunately, after a couple of hours in the fridge the strong coffee rose to the top, and the gelatine sank to the bottom. Mum supplied straws so that the guests could suck up the liquid, though nobody could chew through the gelatinous layer of rubber underneath. A recipe by Robert Carrier — the celebrity chef of the Sixties — for chicken stuffed with cucumber that I made for another party took hours to create and ended up soggy and tasteless. A rich chocolate cake I attempted refused to solidify, no matter how long I left it in the oven, so in the end I poured it into a  frying pan and fried it. Things didn’t improve when I left home and moved into a flat and became my own hostess. You might think a casserole would be fool-proof. Not in my hands. On the one occasion I attempted to make one from scratch, the meat turned into tough little squares of leather and, as I discovered later, guests hid them in their napkins. When my TV consumer programme That’s Life! began, I invited one of our presenters, Michael Groth, home to discuss a difficult investigation. I bought a quiche for supper. Surely nothing could go wrong? But I’d failed to read the label and notice that it was frozen. So I served it, still in that state, to poor Grothy, who never forgot it, and used to tell the story whenever I invited any of the team home. I did perfect one dish, though. My last-minute instant chicken casserole. Here’s the recipe. First, find a chippy, and buy some cooked chicken pieces, one per guest and one extra in case of accident. Next, buy several cans of vegetable soup and some chunky bread. Put the chicken in a large saucepan, heat the soup, and pour over. Serve with the bread and plenty of red wine to distract your guests from the taste. Not on the menu: Spanish paella, while green and mixed salads are in . Thankfully, when I became a working mother I had a series of excellent housekeepers who made nutritious meals for us. But, despite my previous disasters, I still had ambitions in the kitchen. When I interviewed chef Raymond Blanc, I asked him the secret to being a wonderful cook, and he told me cooking food is putting love on a plate. Perhaps that’s why one year I decided to make Christmas lunch for the family. To begin with I felt nothing but pride. The turkey was fine and the Brussels sprouts edible. But then came pudding time. My late husband, Desmond, poured brandy over the traditional Christmas pud and set fire to it with satisfying dramatic effect. As the flames died down I spooned brandy cream over every portion, not noticing until we started eating that I’d used the wrong condiment, and so I had covered every steaming, fragrant lump of pudding — the same pudding I had slaved hours over to create — with mayonnaise. Only my gallantly loyal mother managed to eat it, and declare it was delicious. But then, she was used to my cooking. Most recently I invited Professor Tanya Byron, the respected child psychologist, to lunch to talk about ChildLine’s work. Somehow I  managed to overcook the salmon, so it was brown and hard, but at the same time undercook the new potatoes, so they were like bullets. I apologised, and she was kind. As a psychologist, I hope she didn’t delve into my motivation and think that I was trying to poison her. As my poor family have often said (in the style of MasterChef judges): ‘Cooking does not taste tougher than this.’ So I have now imposed upon myself a cardinal rule of entertaining: never cook, only assemble. In other words, buy prepared ingredients and put them together. The obvious example is salad, writes Esther Rantzen. 'I love salads, not least because they're raw and so can't be under-cooked or cooked to death' The obvious example is salad. I love salads, not least because they’re raw and so can’t be under-cooked or cooked to death. Tear up a few lettuce leaves (or buy them ready-prepared in a bag), add chopped spring onions, tomatoes and cucumber. Serve alongside barbecued chicken, (ready cooked by a supermarket), sliced ham, pre-cooked quails’ eggs, a jar of mayonnaise and a little bottle of classic French dressing and it makes a very respectable lunch. For dessert, it’s ripe camembert and biscuits, or my patent black-and-white pudding. For the sake of other non-cooks, I will share that pudding recipe — my own invention. Take one carton of really classy shop-bought vanilla ice-cream. Buy several punnets of blackberries and a bottle of creme de cassis blackcurrant liqueur. Put several spoonfuls of ice cream in individual glass dishes, then sprinkle with blackberries (or, as Nigella would say, ‘tumble’ in the blackberries). Finally, pour the creme de cassis over everything. But I am aware salad and ice cream won’t do for every occasion, and I do love dinner with friends.    So about 15 years ago, I created a small local dining club, consisting of friends, acquaintances and like-minded locals. One Monday evening a month, we’ll meet at a local restaurant for dinner, splitting the bill equally. It’s the perfect solution for cooks as hopeless as me: there’s no menu to devise or hours spent laying the table beforehand and washing up afterwards. It’s not nearly as expensive as a caterer, you don’t need to know exact numbers, and single women are welcome. And most importantly for me, I don’t have to go through the torture of eating stuff I’ve cooked. In retrospect, it’s what I should have done for the now-infamous That’s Life! reunion. So will I be watching Mary Berry, Paul Hollywood and their baker’s dozen of eager would-be pastry chefs over the forthcoming weeks? No. My thoughts go out to all the hopeless non-cooks, who like me will spend Tuesday nights hiding behind our sofas shouting ‘Great British Bake Off, back off!’","If I invite any of my children to have a cosy supper with me, they only accept on condition it’s a takeaway .

Apples are losing their crunch and becoming sweeter because of global warming, according to Japanese scientists. Data gathered from 1970 to 2010 at two orchards in Japan provides clear evidence that climate change is having an effect on apple taste and texture, said the research team. ‘All such changes may have resulted from earlier blooming and higher temperatures’ during the growth season, they wrote in the journal Nature Scientific Reports. Analysing data gathered from 1970 to 2010 at two orchards in Japan, a research team said there was clear evidence that climate change was having an effect on apple taste and texture . About 60 million tonnes of apples are produced every year, making it the world's third most popular fruit. Previous studies had shown that global warming was causing apple trees to flower earlier, and that harvests were also affected by changes in rainfall and air temperature. The orchards used in the study produce the Fuji and Tsugaru apples, the two most popular kinds in the world. The farms are located in Japan's Nagano and Aomori regions, which had seen a mean air temperature rise of 0.31 and 0.34°C, respectively, per decade. Previous studies had shown that global warming, which many believe is caused by carbon emissions, was causing apple trees to flower earlier, and that harvests were also affected by changes in rainfall and air temperature . The orchards were chosen because there had been no changes in cultivars or management practices for extended periods. The analysis showed a decrease in acidity, firmness and watercore, but a rise in sugar concentration . This ruled out non-climate factors like technological improvements in the apple change. The data collected over the years . included measurements of acid and sugar concentration, fruit firmness . and watercore- a disease that causes water-soaked areas in the flesh of . an apple. The analysis showed a decrease in acidity, firmness and watercore, but a rise in sugar concentration over time. ‘We think that a sweeter apple is a positive thing and a loss of firmness is a negative thing,’ co-author Toshihiko Sugiura of the National Institute of Fruit Tree Science in Fujimoto told AFP. ‘We think most people like sweet and firm apple fruits, although everyone has his own taste. A soft apple is called 'Boke' in Japanese which means a dull or senile fruit.’ The study said that the results ‘suggest that the taste and textural attributes of apples in the market are undergoing change from a long-term perspective, even though consumers might not perceive these subtle change.’ The research claims to be the first to measure changes in the taste and texture of food as a result of climate change. A UK government study released last year identified the top 100 effects of climate change and how they may surprisingly impact Britain in the next century. It found that warmer water temperatures would mean sole and plaice will be more plentiful in the UK, though cod and haddock will move to cooler climates. Sugar beet yields could rise by up to 70 per cent and wheat yields by as much as 140 perc ent by mid-century due to longer growing seasons if water and nutrients are available. ‘A warmer climate presents opportunities to grow new crops such as soya, sunflowers, peaches, apricots and grapes, while new markets may open up overseas for British grown produce,’ the study said.","This is based on data gathered from 1970 to 2010 at two .

A homeless man managed to sleep in a Cambridge University library for six weeks before staff noticed he was not a student. The interloper took advantage of the 24-hour library at St John's College by 'tailgating' students entering the building for late-night study sessions before pretending to peruse books. But he was rumbled after some noticed he never changed his clothes, was pretending to read books and often fell asleep and began snoring. Fooled: The homeless man is believed to have slept at a St John's College library for six weeks before being kicked out . University authorities were alerted and he was ordered to leave by a porter after he could not prove he was a student. One member of the college said on Twitter the man had been 'living under the radar' for six weeks but has not been seen since. It is believed the man was homeless and simply seeking a warm place to spend the night. The front door of St John's Working Library is unlocked when staffed, but locked outside these hours. However students can get in and out of the library 24-hours a day, seven days a week, using their access card. 'One member of the college said on Twitter the man had been 'living under the radar' for six weeks but has not been seen since.' Students told The Cambridge Student newspaper he was frequently seen flicking through books in the History section, using the computer, but mostly seemed to be 'trying to look busy'. Second year St John's medical student Casey Swerner said the mystery man approached her once and made vague claims of working on a PhD on the topic of 'how we perceive religious identity'. Another, Ben Brindley, said: 'He used to pace around. He brought Sainsbury's bags in and ate there, and never changed his clothes.' First year natural sciences student Charlie Dowell told the Daily Telegraph: 'People said he pretended to read things and would fall asleep in the audio-visual room. 'It's very English that it took weeks of students complaining among themselves, but to the right person, before he was kicked out.' A spokesman for St John's College said: 'The presence of a male in the library was reported to the porters who asked him to leave when he was unable to identify himself as a student of the college. He has not been seen in St John's subsequently.'","Interloper 'tailgated' students to get into St John's College library .

Stolen credit card details can be bought online for less than the price of a bag of chips, it has been revealed. There are more than 150 websites offering illegally obtained information, according to government research. Many of them offer for sale details belonging to between 20,000 and 100,000 people worldwide at any one time - charging as little as 70p. The director of Britain's biggest . intelligence agency has also revealed that cyber-attacks on individuals, . businesses and the government have reached 'disturbing' levels. Iain Lobham, of the government's . national intelligence centre, GCHQ, warned that sensitive data had been . targeted and that the 'UK's continued economic well-being' was under . threat. He said sensitive data on government computers had been targeted, along with defence, technology and engineering firms' designs. He . revealed there had been 'one significant (but unsuccessful) attempt on . the Foreign Office and other government departments this summer'. Mr Lobham's comments in an article for The Times come ahead of a two-day London conference on cyber-security starting tomorrow. 'The volume of e-crime and attacks on government and industry systems continues to be disturbing,' he wrote. Spy centre: Iain Lobham director of GCHQ in Cheltenham says cyber-attacks are on the increase . 'I . can attest to attempts to steal British ideas and designs - in the IT, . technology, defence, engineering and energy sectors, as well as other . industries - to gain commercial advantage or to profit from secret . knowledge of contractual arrangements. 'Such intellectual property theft doesn't just cost the companies concerned, it represents an attack on the UK's continued economic well-being'. The conference aims to bring together . political leaders, such as US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and EU . digital supremo Neelie Kroes, with leading cyber security experts and . technology entrepreneurs such as Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales and Cisco . vice-president Brad Boston. The Ministry of Defence foiled more than 1,000 cyber attacks in the past year from criminals and foreign intelligence services. Foreign Secretary William Hague told the . newspaper there had been an 'exponential rise' in incidents, with . systems such as welfare and tax databases 'liable to attack'. 'Countries . that cannot maintain cyber security of their banking system, of the . intellectual property of their companies, will be at a serious . disadvantage in the world,' Mr Hague added. Virus: William Hague revealed that there had been an 'exponential rise' in incidents, with systems and databases 'liable to attack' Mr Lobham called for an inclusive approach to address the problem, adding: 'We are witnessing the development of a global criminal market place - a parallel black economy where cyber dollars are traded in exchanged for UK citizens' credit card details' Mr Hague . revealed in February that computers belonging to the government had . been infected with the 'Zeus' computer virus after users opened an . e-mail purporting to come from the White House and followed a link. He said cyberspace was providing 'rich pickings' with UK defence contractors also being targeted. In January, three Foreign Office staff were sent an email apparently from another colleague. However, Mr Hague said, the email was 'from a hostile state intelligence agency' and contained 'code embedded in the attached document that would have attacked their machine'. The vast majority of critical infrastructure in the UK is privately owned. Leading think-tank Chatham House criticised the government for failing to protect critical systems from cyber-attack adding that there had been a reluctance from  the government to share information with the private companies that might be targeted. The government says it ranks cyber security as a top priority. Last year it announced £650m of additional funding to help tackle computer-based threats. Around £130m is specifically earmarked for critical infrastructure projects.","More than 150 websites offering illegally obtained information .

Cash-strapped families have cut their energy use since 2005 as bills have soared. A combination of increased charges and wages flatlining have forced households to turn their heating off to cut costs. New figures also reveal wide variations in the amount of energy people use in different parts of the country, with people in the East Midlands using almost double that of homes in the South West. Energy bills: New figures show how the amount of energy households use has fallen by 25 per cent since 2005 . The average home usage in England and Wales fell by 24.7% over the period to 2011, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Consumer groups said that while energy savings measures may have played apart, the big drop will have been caused by people simply switching off their heating altogether. A study this month found people struggling with energy bills face a gap of £438 between their bills and what they can afford to pay – an increase of almost £200 over the last decade. The gap means those in fuel poverty in England alone face bills totalling £1.05billion more than they can afford – a jump from £606million in 2003. Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer watchdog Which? said: ‘Energy efficiency measures may have played a part in the fall in energy usage but the fact is many consumers will have cut back in order to save money in the face of spiraling prices and squeezed incomes. ‘Consistently four in ten have told us that they plan to cut back on future spending on their energy bills.’ He called for the government to do more to help people cope with the rising cost of energy bills. ‘People will not feel confident that they are getting a fair deal unless prices are simplified and the costs that make up our energy bills are open, transparent and subject to robust scrutiny.’ The highest regional consumption levels - which were adjusted to take into account the variations in weather - were in the East Midlands, the data showed. It appeared that regions with the highest level of Economy 7 consumption of night-time cheap electricity use more energy overall. In England and Wales overall, average household energy consumption was 19.7 megawatt hours (mWh) per household in 2011 . Across England and Wales, average household energy consumption fell from 26.2 megawatt hours (mWh) in 2005 to 19.7mWh in 2011. Improvements such as better loft and cavity wall insulation as well as more efficient boilers may be among the reasons for the decrease, the ONS said. Another could be the introduction of energy rating scales for properties and household appliances, allowing consumers to make informed choices about purchases, it added. There has also been ‘increasing public awareness of energy consumption and environmental issues’ while at the same time the price of gas and electricity across the UK has been rising. The average household energy consumption in the East Midlands in 2011 was 27.5 mWh, well above the national average, while the South West had the lowest, at 16.1 mWh. Worries: Consumer groups said households were forced to cut their energy use to cope with rising bills . A breakdown of local authorities showed that those consuming less energy tended to be in more rural areas, with a higher proportion of households without piped gas and therefore possibly using other sources of energy. Of the 10 authorities with the lowest consumption - topped by the Isles of Scilly - eight included rural parts of Wales and the South West, although two were in the capital - the City of London and Tower Hamlets. The ONS said that areas that consumed more household energy tended to have higher levels of net income after taking account of housing costs. All the top 10 areas for consumption were in the East Midlands - a region that had the second highest level of Economy 7 use as a proportion of all energy. ‘It could be that households which receive some electricity at a cheaper rate may use more energy overall because it is cheaper,’ the ONS said. Industry body Energy UK said: ‘This fall in consumption shows how effective it is to insulate your home. Britain's homes are notoriously leaky and energy companies have been busy improving properties to make them warmer and easier to heat. ‘They have installed insulation and other measures in millions of homes across the country over the past few years.’","Energy use falls by 25% from 2005 to 2011, new figures show .

Vine videos are a relatively new phenomenon but the idea of making short moving pictures dates back as far as the early 19th century. In 1829, a Belgian physicist invented the phenakistoscope, or 'spindle viewer' as a toy for his sons. It spun images around an axis making them appear to move when looked at in a mirror. The images depicted traditional scenes, including couples dancing and horses jumping, to more abstract clips such as men diving into the mouths of lions, and now artist Richard Balzer has created digital versions of these stunning animations. Still images were drawn onto a disc . and each image was slightly different, in the same way images are drawn . on the pages of a flip book. This disc was attached to another that had slits cut around it and both were attached to an axis in the centre. The disc with the images on was held . in front of a mirror and was spun around this axis. When looked at in . the mirror, the images appeared to move in circles. The toy was created by blind scientist Joseph Plateau at the same time Austrian Simon von Stampfer designed an identical device called the stroboscope. Still images were drawn onto a disc and each image was slightly different, in the same way images are drawn on the pages of a flip book. This disc was attached to another that had slits cut around it and both were attached to an axis in the centre. The disc with the images on was held in front of a mirror and was spun around this axis. When looked at in the mirror, through the slits, the images appeared to move in circles. The . phenakistoscope was also referred to as the Phantasmascope and . Fantoscope and was ultimately replaced by William George Horner's zoetrope. A zoetrope is different because the images are fitted inside a spinning wheel and users peer through the slits in the side of the toy. This means more than one person can see the moving images for various angles. Although the toy was invented before Queen Victoria took to the throne, it became popular during her reign. Plateau's design was based on the work of Michael Faraday and his 'Faraday's Wheel', which spun two discs in opposite directions to create an electrical charge from a magnetic field. The phenakistoscope toy, pictured left, was . created by blind scientist Joseph Plateau and showed moving images in a . mirror. It was ultimately replaced by the zoetrope, pictured right, that . used the same principles but the images are instead fitted inside a . wheel and can be viewed by multiple people from different angles . It used the principle of 'persistence of motion' in which images are used in such a way to create an illusion of motion. A later, handheld version of Plateau's design was created in which the discs were separated, thus removing the need for a mirror. Examples of scenes, depicted on the original phenakistoscope, include a couple dancing and horses jumping over fences. Others show jesters performing star jumps as red and yellow birds fly near their heads, frogs hopping around a circle of grass blowing in the wind, and magpies bouncing on top of people's heads as the people are showing eating small blue balls. There are also kaleidoscopic phenakistoscopes that use geometric shapes to create a hypnotic effect, and more surreal images of men climbing ladders into the mouth of the Moon, or diving into the mouths of lions.","Phenakistoscope was created in Belgium as a predecessor to the flip book .

Investigate: Policemen and firefighters search the site of the crash for evidence of how the train was derailed . Upsetting: At least six people perished in the horrific accident on the outskirts of Paris on Friday night. Police officers investigate the scene of the crash . Pierre Izard, a spokesman for SNCF, France's national railways company, said a metal bar connecting two rails had become detached close to Bretigny-sur-Orge station. Referring to a switch joint, Mr Izard said: 'It moved into the centre of the switch and in this position it prevented the normal passage of the train's wheels and it may have caused the derailment.' The train was travelling at 85mph - under the speed limit of 93mph, said Mr Izard, who added: 'The SNCF considers itself responsible for the lives of its clients.' Today a crane was due to arrive at the scene to lift a mangled carriage which flipped over when the train hit a station platform. 'The fear is that victims may still be trapped in the wreckage,' said a French railways manager at the scene. 'The recovery operation will be carrying on all day.' Injuries: Dozens of other passengers suffered lighter wounds, including British passengers among the 385 on board the Limoges-bound service . Probe: Police officers walk along the tracks at the site of the train crash today . A police spokesman described groups of local people 'picking through the wreckage' on Friday night. 'It appeared at first that they were trying to help, but it soon became clear that they were taking personal property away. When police approached they threw stones before running away.' The crash site, some 16 miles from the centre of Paris, is surrounded by waste land used as a temporary home by vagrants and recent immigrants to France, mainly from eastern Europe. Six carriages derailed in all, with the third and fourth leaving the rail first, at around 5.14pm. Other carriages soon followed, with one mounting the station platform, a preliminary enquiry has established. It is being carried out by SNCF, judicial authorities and the BEA safety agency. French transport minister Frederic Cuvillier has ruled out 'human error' - instead praising the train driver for averting an even more serious accident.

President Obama has returned to his favored campaigning style as he gave a speech about the need for immigration reform to a group of advocates at the White House today. The President spoke about the need for Washington to move past the unpopular shutdown infighting and called upon politicians to unite behind substantive immigration reform. ‘Rather than create problems, let’s prove to the American people that Washington can actually solve some problems,’ he said during the speech in the East Room. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE . Moving on: President Obama gave a speech in the White House on Thursday pushing for a united vote following the shutdown over the budget battle . ‘Let’s see if we can get this done and let’s see if we can get it done this year. We’ve got the time to do it. Republicans in the house including the Speaker have said we should act so let’s not wait. It doesn’t get easier to delay.’ The Senate already passed their version of a bill in June- which the President conceded was not perfect in anyone’s view- and now it is up to the House of Representatives to set a date for a vote. Speaker John Boehner, whose approval ratings dropped dramatically during the shutdown that was viewed by the public as largely being caused by the Republicans, said that there would be enough support in the House to pass a bipartisan immigration bill but likely not the one that President Obama supports. That came as little surprise to the President, as he even said that there is a sentiment for some people in Washington that their policy decisions are seen in a binary way: ‘Well, if Obama's for it, then I'm against it,’ he joked. Faces of immigration: The President stuck to the talking points but had a hand-picked crowd of immigrants and issue advocates standing behind him and Vice President Joe Biden . Eyes on the prize: Immigration reform was a major campaign promise of President Obamas and a number of his supporters have been critical of the fact that it has taken him a year into his second term to address the issue . Boehner's spokesman put out a statement . immediately following the speech saying that the Speaker does want to . approve a 'common sense, step-by-step approach' but is vehemently . opposed to 'massive' legislation. If passed, the proposed law would allow certain immigrants six years to apply for a work or family visa to gain legal status in the country within. That is just the beginning of a 13-year path that is proposed by the bill. In order to be given legal approval, they will have to prove that they are not a burden to the American economy, or else they will be deported to their home countries. It will also add billions of dollars to increase border control as part of a way to appeal to hard line conservatives. President Obama focused on the talking points of the Senate bill- touting the fact that independent economists have said that the measure would help grow the economy and shrink the deficit by nearly a trillion dollars. He used a crowd of unnamed immigration activists standing on risers behind him to put the personal face on the issue. 'It doesn't make sense to have 11 million people who are in this country illegally without any incentive or any way for them to come out of the shadows, get right with the law, meet their responsibilities and permit their families then to move ahead,' he said. 'It's not smart; it's not fair; it doesn't make sense. We have kicked this particular can down the road for too long. The question of training highly-trained workers at American universities but then forcing them to leave the country and use their skills elsewhere because of visa concerns is an issue that has been brought up by many business leaders, including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and outgoing New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. ‘It's not smart to invite some of the . brightest minds from around the world to study here and then not let . them start businesses here. We've sent them back to their home countries . to start businesses and create jobs and invent new products someplace . else,' the President said in his Thursday speech. Reaching out: The President shook hands with hand-picked supporters after the brief remarks, though their names were never revealed, nor were any reasons why they were chosen . Facing the issue: The President is pushing for the bill to be passed in the House this year . ‘It . would make sure that everybody plays by the same rules by providing a . pathway to earned citizenship for those who are here illegally, one that . includes passing a background check, learning English, paying taxes, . paying a penalty, getting in line behind everyone who is trying to come . here the right way. ‘Obviously just because something is smart and fair and good for the economy and fiscally responsible and supported by business and labor, the evangelical community and many Democrats and many Republicans, that does not mean that it will actually get done. This is Washington, after all.’ Try as he may, the President was playing a bit of politics himself as he had Vice President Joe Biden at his side throughout the event. Biden is in a tight private competition with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to take the party's reins when the President's second term comes to a close in 2016. Clinton is widely seen as the one to beat, but Biden has been making his intentions known with trips to pivotal primary battleground states like Iowa in recent weeks.","President Obama gave a speech calling for the immigration reform bill to be passed through the House by the end of this year .

An earlier species of the bees died out with the dinosaurs when many flowering plants were also wiped out, scientists said. Despite the lack of fossilised evidence, researchers were able to prove for the first time that carpenter bees underwent mass extinction 65 million years ago as part of an analysis of DNA in modern bees. The findings could help scientists shed light on the current decline in bee species across the globe that threatens the world’s crop reliant on bees for pollination. Despite the lack of fossilised evidence, researchers have proved for the first time that carpenter bees underwent massive extinction 65 million years ago as part of an analysis of DNA in modern bees. An Eastern carpenter bee is pictured . American and Australian scientists teamed up to model a mass extinction in bee group Xylocopinae, or carpenter bees, at the end of the Cretaceous and beginning of the Paleogene eras, known as the K-T boundary. Previous studies have suggested a widespread extinction among flowering plants at the K-T boundary and it has long been assumed that the bees who depended upon those plants would have met the same fate. Yet unlike the dinosaurs 'there is a relatively poor fossil record of bees' making the confirmation of such an extinction difficult. Using a technique called molecular phylogenetics, the scientists analysed the DNA sequences of four 'tribes' of 230 species of carpenter bees from every continent except Antarctica for insight into evolutionary relationships. American and Australian scientists teamed up to model a mass extinction in bee group Xylocopinae, or carpenter bees, at the end of the Cretaceous and beginning of the Paleogene eras, known as the K-T boundary. It is thought that bees searched for nectar from ancient flowers, illustrated alongside Leptoceratops . In the study published in journal PLOS ONE, they began to see patterns consistent with a mass extinction. Combining fossil records with the DNA analysis, the researchers could introduce time into the equation, learning not only how the bees are related but also how old they are. Sandra Rehan, assistant professor of biological sciences at University of New Hampshire, said: 'The data told us something major was happening in four different groups of bees at the same time. 'And it happened to be the same time as the dinosaurs went extinct.' While much of Professor Rehan’s work involved behavioural observation of bees native to the northeast of North America, the research taps the computer-heavy bioinformatics side of her expertise; assembling genomic data to explain similarities and differences among the various species over time. Using a technique called molecular phylogenetics, the scientists analysed the DNA sequences of four 'tribes' of 230 species of carpenter bees from every continent except Antarctica for insight into evolutionary relationships. A bumble bee on white Chrysanthemum is pictured . Marrying observations from the field with genomic data, she believes, paints a fuller picture of these bees’ behaviours over time. She said: 'If you could tell their whole story, maybe people would care more about protecting them. 'Indeed, the findings of this study have important implications for today’s concern about the loss in diversity of bees - a pivotal species for agriculture and biodiversity. 'Understanding extinctions and the effects of declines in the past can help us understand the pollinator decline and the global crisis in pollinators today.'","American and Australian scientists teamed up to model a mass extinction of carpenter bees at the end of the Cretaceous era .

With two young kids I kept thinking about all the things I wouldn't be able to do with them. Thankfully, the operation was a success.'

Officers filmed the full extent of his designer makeover as they searched the £300,000 property for evidence Emsley was involved in dealing heroin in Fleetwood. They found thousands of pounds in cash in a safe at the property, and discovered £118,000 had been credited to his bank account.

The Coalition has squandered £800million on consultants and temps to do the work vacated by tens of thousands of civil servants who received almost £300million in redundancy payoffs. An investigation into the Whitehall ‘revolving door’ scandal has found that departments have been laying off workers but taking on expensive consultants - some earning more than £1,000 a day - to do the same jobs. In 2012/13, the cost of pay-offs to redundant civil servants totalled £287million - with the Ministry of Justice and the Department for Work and Pensions topping the league table of payments. Whitehall 'revolving door' scandal: Departments have been laying off workers but taking on expensive consultants - some earning more than £1,000 a day - to do the same jobs (file picture) More than 140 civil servants at the MoJ received pay-offs exceeding £100,000 - including four who got between £250,0000 and £350,000. This total spent on pay-offs was however dwarfed by the £506million spent on consultants helping with projects such as the HS2 rail link, Universal Credit and the West Coast Main Line. Departments spent a further £328million on ‘off-payroll’ staff, including the employment of short-term or ‘interim’ managers. The huge spend has occurred despite the fact that Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, announced curbs on the use of management consultants three years ago - saying they were ‘both wasteful and demoralising for mainstream civil servants who feel marginalised’. Yet the investigation by The Times found that firms such as KPMG, PwC, Deloitte and Ernst & Young are now being wooed back into government to complete difficult projects before the election, and to cover specialist areas such as IT, finance and accountancy. An insider said: ‘They are determined to . get everything done by 2015 and where anything is going wrong they are . bringing in consultants. It appears that Francis Maude’s ban has been . lifted.’ Bernard Jenkin, . chairman of the Commons public administration committee, criticised the . revolving door, saying: ‘We have let good people go as part of the . downsizing - but how many of these consultants are ex-civil servants?’ Some 70,000 civil servants have lost their jobs over the last three years. Unimpressed: Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the Commons public administration committee, criticised the revolving door . Figures show that the Ministry of Justice recorded a high of £89million in exit payments for staff in 2012/13, followed by the Department of Work and Pensions’ £67million. The highest payment was £623,555 to an unnamed official at the Crown Prosecution Service, and a mandarin at the Department for Education got £450,000. Moira Wallace, former permanent . secretary at the Department for Energy and Climate Change, received the . highest severance payment - £470,000. 'We have let good people go as part of the downsizing - but how many of these consultants are ex-civil servants?' Bernard Jenkin, Commons public administration committee chairman . She left following a reportedly strained relationship with Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey. A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said: ‘We’ve already put an end to excessive consultancy spend by establishing stringent controls across Government saving, over £1.6billion in 2012-13 compared to the level of spending in 2009-10. ‘The Cabinet Office delivers projects across a wide range of high-profile policy areas. It is sometimes necessary to recruit for specialist business-critical roles. ‘Such roles are only authorised where the skills are not readily available within civil service and where using temporary labour is better value for taxpayers’ money than hiring full-time staff. ‘Bringing in procurement, finance and digital expertise plays a crucial part in our determination to strengthen the corporate centre in Whitehall and ensuring that government operates like the best-run businesses.’","Cost of pay-offs to redundant civil servants in 2012/13 totalled £287m .

Peter Foster was sentenced to three years' prison for his forbidden role in the weight loss industry . Conman Peter Foster - the figure at the centre of the 2002 'Cheriegate' scandal - was sentenced to three years in prison in his absence today for his forbidden role in the weight loss industry. Foster, 51, has been in hiding for four weeks after failing to attend court in Brisbane, Australia, for sentencing for continuing to support a weight loss company. The judge then found him guilty of contempt of court after he failed to meet a two hour deadline to turn up. While in hiding, he said in a phone call from somewhere in southern Queensland that he would be ready to give himself up once he could be sure that his aging mother, Lou Foster, would be cared for. In sentencing Foster - the former boyfriend of Cherie Blair's fitness guru Carole Caplin - the court ordered that he should serve at least 18 months of the three year sentence. The court had been told that Foster had been involved in a scam involving a weight loss nasal spray in 2009. A warrant for his arrest, initially put in place after he first failed to appear in court, has now been renewed. Foster's lawyer, Terry Fisher, said after Foster's non-appearance today that he had withdrawn his representation. He said he had been in touch with Foster, but he did not know where he was. 'Yes, I have had contact with him,' said Mr Fisher. Then, in suggestion that he might have had a computer video-chat with the conman, added: 'The last I saw him there was a palm tree waving in the background, so I'm not sure where he is.' When Foster first failed to face Justice John Logan in the Supreme Court last month it was revealed he had written a letter to the judge explaining he was arranging appropriate care for his ailing mother. But he has not been seen by police or court officials since that time, although he told a journalist who spoke to him by phone that he had every intention of showing up at the court today for sentencing. Again, he failed to arrive - and it was then that his lawyers, barrister Liam Burrow and solicitor Terry Fisher, announced they would no longer be representing him. Peter Foster and his girlfriend Carole Caplin, who was a close friend of Cherie Blair, in 2002 . In 2002, it was alleged but later denied that Cherie Blair, the wife of prime minister Tony, bought two flats with the assistance of Peter Foster, a convicted Australian conman. A boyfriend of her friend, Carole Caplin, he allegedly negotiated a discount for Mrs Blair on the properties. She later apologised for the connection in an address on live television. The prime minister's wife choked back tears live on air and asked for understanding over her dealings with Foster, saying: 'I'm not Superwoman.' Mr Burrow said he would be facing 'professional embarrassment'  if he continued to keep Foster as his client. Before withdrawing their services, the lawyers handed to the judge a bundle of correspondence they had received from the conman, who has frequently boasted of being jailed on three continents, his crimes all related to the slimming industry. David Kent, representing the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, told the court he was struggling to find where Foster had ever held a legitimate job and described him as a 'career criminal, distilled to its essence.' In 2002, it was alleged but later denied . that Cherie Blair, the wife of British prime minister Tony, bought two . flats with the assistance of Peter Foster, a convicted Australian conman . Court observers said Mr Kent appeared visibly appalled at Foster's record - which has focused entirely on the weight loss industry - as he said the conman wore his reputation as a 'badge of honour'. He referred to Foster's website in which he describes himself as 'an international man of mystery'. The judge said it appeared to have a 'buccaneer quality'. It was the commission that had initial brought Foster to court because he had breached a 'no involvement' order in the weight loss industry. It was claimed - and has since been proved - that Foster was involved in a so-called slimming nasal spray called SensaSlim. Police have now been instructed to renew their efforts to find the fugitive conman, amid rumours that he had fled Queensland - and, somehow, even the country.","Foster in hiding for four weeks after failing to attend court for sentencing .

A Georgia man has been convicted of killing his father and seven extended family members in a mobile home they all shared, though prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty. Guy Heinze Jr, 26, of Brunswick was found guilty of eight counts of malice murder Friday. But the judge in the case said shortly after the verdict was announced that prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty after a juror was dismissed earlier Friday. Prosecutors dropped a possible death sentence in a deal with defense lawyers that allowed them to avoid a mistrial. Sentencing: Jerry Word of the Office of the Georgia Capital Defender (left) talks to Guy Heinze, Jr Thursday October 24 in Glynn County Superior Court in Brunswick, Georgia . Prosecutor John B Johnson told reporters 'a situation' with one juror had the jury deadlocked. Heinze's lawyers agreed to excuse that juror if prosecutors took the death penalty off the table. Johnson says neither side wanted a mistrial, which would have meant trying Heinze again. Police charged Heinze with the killings six days after he reported finding the bodies to police. In a frantic 911 call he cried: 'My whole family is dead!' Heinze's younger brother, Tyler Heinze, started crying and was escorted from the courtroom after the verdict was read, yelling expletives as he left. Convicted: Guy Heinze Jr was found guilty of murdering his father and six others in 2009 . Prosecutors said Heinze had been smoking crack cocaine when he attacked his father and the others as they slept. Police found the victims scattered . between five rooms of the cramped mobile home. Autopsies showed they . suffered more than 220 wounds combined and each died from skull and . brain injuries. No murder weapon was found, but police suspect they were . beaten with a shotgun barrel. Heinze's defense team argued one person couldn't have slain so many people without anyone escaping. They . worked to persuade the jury that police ignored alternative suspects . and evidence as they rushed to build a case against Heinze based . entirely on circumstantial evidence. Heinze's lawyers also said there . was no compelling motive for him to kill his father, 45-year-old Guy . Heinze Sr, and the others. Rusty Toler Jr, 44, was slain along with his . four children: Chrissy Toler, 22; Russell D Toler Jr, 20; Michael . Toler, 19; and Michelle Toler, 15. Also killed was the elder Toler's . sister, Brenda Gail Falagan, 49, and Joseph L West, the 30-year-old . boyfriend of Chrissy Toler. Her three-year-old son, Byron Jimerson Jr, . ended up the sole survivor but suffered severe head injuries. Heinze told police his father went to live with the elder Toler's family when they were both teenagers. The suspect said he considered Rusty Toler Sr to be his uncle, and the man's children were his cousins. Crime scene: The mobile home where Heinze lived with his father and seven others . Prosecutor John B Johnson told the jury in his closing argument Wednesday that a fight over drugs probably sparked the killings, which happened sometime between midnight and 5:30am. Police believe Heinze killed Rusty Toler Sr with the barrel of a shotgun in the closet of the bedroom they shared because Heinze wanted to take a bottle of painkillers prescribed to one of Toler's sons. Afraid of being caught, Johnson said, Heinze then 'goes through the house - angry, mad or whatever - and kills them all.' Heinze's lead defense attorney, Newell Hamilton Jr, told the jury it was hard to believe Heinze would kill eight people he loved over a bottle of 'weak painkillers.' Two defense experts testified there must have been more than one killer in the house. A former police detective estimated three to five attackers committed the killings. Heinze told police he was out all night and found the bodies when he returned home after dawn. Blood on Heinze's shorts, undershorts and shoes was matched to four of the victims, though none was found on his shirt, hands or face. Suspect: Guy Heinze Jnr told police he returned home and found several family members either dead or dying. He made a frantic phone call to the emergency services, screaming: 'My whole family is dead!' A defense expert testified the blood was smeared, not spattered, indicating it must have gotten on Heinze's clothes when he found the bodies hours after the killings rather than as they were being committed.Police said Heinze also left a clue in his 911 call, in which he said of the victims: 'It looks like they've all been beaten to death!' Investigators testified the victims' wounds were so grievous that police initially thought they had all been shot. Evidence showed police swabbed Heinze's hands to test them for gunshot residue.Investigators found Michelle Toler's bloody cellphone in Heinze's car and a shotgun with Heinze's palm print on the stock in blood from one of the victims. Heinze told police he tried to hide the gun from them because it was stolen, but a background check showed one of the victims legally owned it. Still, the shotgun was ruled out as the murder weapon. Police concluded the victims were probably beaten with a second shotgun after they found its broken stock by the elder Toler's head .

Tragic: Hannah Bleasdale died in her sleep after 'suffering a seizure' caused by an undiagnosed medical condition . A dental nurse died in her sleep after 'suffering a seizure' caused by an undiagnosed condition triggered by a blood clot she was believed to have successfully recovered from. Hannah Bleasdale, 19, described as a 'precious daughter', was . discovered wrapped up in her duvet at her family home in Leyland, Lancashire, an inquest heard. Her mother had come into the bedroom to try to wake her for a second time - before realising her daughter had passed away. The teenager, who loved horse riding, had suffered from a blood clot on the brain in 2009 which was believed to have been successfully treated, Preston Coroner's Court heard today. It caused her severe headaches and pain - but doctors now fear it may have had fatal repercussions. Miss Bleasdale, who missed two months of school after the clot was discovered, died just weeks before she had been due to jet off to the Dominican Republic to fulfil her dream of swimming with dolphins. She had gone to bed early on the night of May 27 after hugging her younger brother and sending texts to her boyfriend and cousin. Her mother Elaine, 57, tried to wake . her at 10am the following morning - but . thinking her daughter was still asleep, she left the room. She returned at 12.30pm to . rouse her - only to discover her teenage child had died. Professor Tim Dawson, a consultant neuropathologist, said: '(Hannah) wouldn’t have known anything about it. 'Precious daughter': The teenager, pictured with her parents Elaine and Phil, had suffered from a blood clot on the brain in 2009 which was believed to have been successfully treated . 'She had taken a drink of coffee to her bedroom. She had texted her cousin and her boyfriend. Her mother found her lying on her front with her body covered by the duvet.' Professor Dawson said the post-mortem examination showed no abnormalities on Miss Bleasdale's brain or heart which could have contributed to her death, but concluded her death was most likely to have been caused by a seizure. 'We are all allowed one seizure,' he said. 'That doesn’t make us epileptic. You have to look at the probabilities. 'In this case, I would suggest that evidence points to some sort of seizure after what happened in the past. That affected the blood vessels and allowed fluid to flow into the lungs.' Devastating: Miss Bleasdale, who missed two months of school after the clot was discovered, died just weeks before she had been due to jet off to the Dominican Republic to fulfil her dream of swimming with dolphins . Dr Wendy Grice, Miss Bleasdale’s GP from birth, told the inquest she had seen Hannah on a number of occasions, but nothing had emerged to make her believe Hannah was seriously unwell. 'There was no history of Hannah having seizures but she did have a significant clot on the brain in 2009,' she said. 'It led to her having severe headaches. She was entered for a scan and that revealed the clot. At her next MRI scan, the clot had gone. Drugs were given which allowed the clot to resolve.' Father: Phil Bleasdale arrives at Preston Coroner's Court today . Despite missing two months of school after the clot was discovered, Miss Bleasdale still managed to achieve six As and four Bs in her GCSEs. Recording a verdict of death by natural causes, coroner Simon Jones said: 'Professor Dawson couldn’t find anything structural that could confirm the cause of death. 'His conclusion is that on the balance of probabilities she had some form of seizure-related death. I see no reason to dispute those findings. 'There was nothing untoward about this death - but given we’re talking about the death of a 19-year-old, that’s perhaps not the right word. 'I realise there is nothing I can say that offers any comfort but I do offer my condolences. I am very sorry that you had to come here.' After the inquest, Hannah’s devastated mother Elaine, who attended the hearing with husband Phil, 51, and Hannah’s grandparents, paid tribute to her daughter - saying she had loved her job and had enjoyed going out with her many friends at weekends. 'She was such a precious daughter. She was loved by all her family as you can see. It was a natural death and I’m glad she died peacefully,' said Elaine. 'We’re pleased that if you have to go then she did it peacefully. We will miss her so much.' At the time of Hannah’s death, Elaine told how the teenager had started to organise her clothes for a holiday, before hugging her younger brother and going to bed early. 'I gave her a hug and a kiss in the kitchen and she said she loved us,' she said. 'The following morning I just thought she was having a lie in. I went up to ask if she wanted anything for breakfast or lunch. I went up and that was it. It was a complete shock.' Professor Dawson has asked for Miss Bleasdale's immediate family to be screened to prevent any future tragedies.","Hannah Bleasdale was discovered wrapped up in her duvet by her mother .

Troubled: Prosecutors said Greff and Spatucci began dating two years ago, that she gave birth in February and that the two had lived together for a short time before she split from him and moved in with her parents . Investigators believe Spatucci drove to the Greff residence late Tuesday and entered, undetected, through a second-floor window. Once inside Greff's bedroom, prosecutors say an argument became violent and Spatucci killed her, leaving the body on the bed. Her father found her dead early Wednesday, police said. WABC reported that Greff's parents left the home to run some errands in the morning and then got back to make a horrific discovery.

A call center due to open in the fall to tell the public about ObamaCare has been criticized for offering half of its employees part-time work, which will deny them the very benefits they have been hired to promote. Staff and city officials in Contra Costa County have been left dismayed that the successful bid to run one of three Californian call centers has ended in employees being left without benefits. More than 7,000 people applied for just 180 positions at the Concord call center, which is due to open on October 1. They believed most of the roles would be full-time and come with health insurance. Dismay: While some Americans have objected to Obamacare, in Concord residents and officials welcomed the jobs they hoped it would create . However, according to the Contra Costa Times, half of the positions have now been made part time, meaning 90 employees, who are estimated to be paid $15 to $18 an hour, will face costs of between $600 and $2,900 a month for their healthcare. Under Obamacare, companies with 50 or more employees are only required to offer coverage to full-time staff. 'It is very disappointing. I was under the impression these were going to be well-paying, well-compensated positions,' county supervisor Mary Piepho said. 'We were really hopeful these would be jobs meeting the unemployment needs in our county and offer them the ability to make a living and support their families,' she added. The city had welcomed the chance to . run one of the call centers, which will help people enroll in Obamacare, . believing it would generate jobs and better prospects, according to the New York Post. Under the deal for setting up the center, the city had to agree to fund the operation itself. Two . other centers, in Rancho Cordova and Fresno, are also being opened but . the one in Concord is the only center to be contracted out to a county, . according to Mercury News. Disappointed: County supervisors Mary Piepho, left, and Karen Mitchoff, right, say they believed the call center jobs created in Concord would be full-time and well-compensated positions . Concord officials have claimed that it was clear from the start that some positions would be part time but, according to the Contra Costa Times, a staff list and job advert listed nearly all the vacancies as full time. Some employees, who asked not to be identified, claimed that they only found out they were being offered part-time positions after orientation and training. 'What's really ironic is working for a call center and trying to help people get health care, but we can't afford it ourselves,' one employee said. An employee claimed they were first told about the part-time hours after a training session on July 18. 'It reminded me of that George Clooney . movie [Up In The Air] where he goes around the country firing people. The woman said, ""I know you were led to believe you would be full . time, but things have changed ... You are actually part-time . intermittent"".' the employee said. The new recruits added that no clear reasons were given. Another person said they had turned down another job offer to accept a role at the call center after receiving a letter in June, but have not been able to confirm their position since. Contra Costa Deputy County Administrator Theresa Speiker said the hiring company had been clear about the types of positions available, and added that the part-time staff would be used to cover the extended hours. Controversial: The Concord call center is being opened to help Californians enroll in President Obama's healthcare reforms . Opposition: The healthcare reforms, under which companies with 50 or more employees must offer cover to staff, have been criticized . For the first three months after it opens on October 1, the call center is due to be open for 72 hours a week. After that it is expected to drop to 59 hours. 'The battle for the call center was over jobs with good working wages and benefits; I never dreamed they would be part-time,' county supervisor Karen Mitchoff said. She added that several of her constituents had complained to her about the hiring process.","Concord city disappointed that much-needed jobs lack benefits .

Mrs Greaves, a mother of four and . grandmother, watched her husband of 40 years die in hospital three days . later. During the trial she sat quietly . through more than three weeks of evidence, but yesterday she broke down . into sobs as the jury reached its verdict on Foster following 13 hours . of deliberations. She said: ‘Alan was a wonderful man . who is so dearly missed. Our lives will never be the same again. Alan . was a man who was driven by love and compassion and he would not want . any of us to hold on to feelings of hate and unforgiveness. So in honour . of Alan and in honour of the God we both love my prayer is that this . story doesn’t end today. ‘My prayer is that Jonathan Bowling . and Ashley Foster will come to understand and experience the love and . kindness of the God who made him in his own image and that God’s great . mercy will inspire them to true repentance.’ Sheffield Crown Court heard how, after . the attack, Foster said Bowling grabbed his wrists and told him: . ‘That’s me being normal – imagine me going sick.’ Foster maintained that . he did not wield the pickaxe handle. Court drama: There was confusion at Sheffield Crown Court when the clerk only asked the jury foreman for the murder verdict against Foster . Vicious: Following Foster's conviction, police have released this picture of the pick-axe handle used in Alan Greaves' murder . But the prosecution said that the pair . were ‘in it together’ and deliberately chose a dimly-lit area to launch . the savage attack. Police said the killers came across . their victim, a retired social worker, by chance because he had returned . to his house to fetch his hat. Robert Smith, QC, prosecuting, said: . ‘Their motive was not one of robbery, in short these two men were . walking the streets looking for a suitable victim. ‘If it hadn’t been Mr Greaves it would . have been somebody else. They both intended to inflict really serious . bodily harm to Mr Greaves.’ The pair, both unemployed, were . arrested after being identified on CCTV footage released to the media . showing them walking behind Mr Greaves. Foster turned himself in to police . after seeing the CCTV footage. He claimed he had not come forward before . because he was scared of Bowling. Horrific: Mr Greaves was on his way to St Saviours C of E Church, High Green, when he was attacked . In the case of Bowling, he admitted . murder after his DNA was discovered on a piece of wood from the murder . weapon which was lodged in Mr Greaves’s head. Bowling, of Burngreave, Sheffield and Foster of High Green, are expected to be sentenced today. After the hearing Det Supt Matt . Fenwick, who led the police inquiry, praised Mrs Greaves and her family . for displaying ‘great strength and dignity in such ghastly . circumstances’. He said: ‘Alan was a man who worked . all his life. He was a loving father and husband and he was the local . church organist and did extensive charity work. It could have been . anybody. ‘He was not targeted. That is the unpleasant part about this particular crime.’ Mrs Greaves, who works for the Church . Army charity, added that her compassion for the killers had done nothing . to stop the constant pain she felt. ‘I used to be a happy and fulfilled . person who lived with my soul mate. Suddenly I am lonely and I have no . one to talk to, as we did constantly. ‘I put my energy into getting through . the tears and the crying each day. I don’t want people to think that . because I can forgive, this has been an easy journey for me. The switch . from being happily married to single has been horrific.’ Brutal: The scene where Mr Greaves' was attacked in the High Lane area of Sheffield last Christmas Eve . Community in shock: Local residents bring flowers and talk to police at the scene where Mr Greaves' was killed . By . Eleanor Harding and Chris Brooke . He was a devout Christian whose kind nature endeared him to all he met. They were two workshy thugs who smoked cannabis and terrorised their neighbourhoods. The contrast between Alan Greaves and his killers could hardly have been more stark. Memories: Mr Greaves' quiet and religious life was in deep contrast to his violent and senseless death . Happier times: Maureen Greaves described her husband as a 'truly beautiful man' Mr Greaves, 68, described by friends . as a ‘gentle soul’, dedicated his life to helping others – first as a . social worker and then as a church organist. His wife Maureen, also a social . worker, said he often went ‘beyond the call of duty’ in looking after . his clients and was involved in a host of community activities. Before . he left his home for the last time, he brought her flowers and told her: . ‘I love you so much, Maureen, and I’m so glad that I married you.’ Bereft: Maureen Greaves spoke movingly at the funeral of her husband Alan's funeral about how he would have advised her not to be angry with his killers . Meanwhile, Jonathan Bowling and Ashley . Foster had spent the day drinking and smoking cannabis and had headed . out looking for trouble. The stepbrothers lived near Mr . Greaves. Neither had ever had a proper job and Bowling’s family was . known to be on long-term benefits. Bowling had been released from prison . only in October, weeks before the killing. He has been jailed for a . number of violent robberies and is said to have terrorised neighbours . since the age of 13, with them even petitioning the council to have him . removed. Friends say he was expelled from . secondary school on his first day and spent long spells of his teenage . years in juvenile detention centres. His mother Denise Sheppard, 55, who . worked part-time in Poundland, was forced to hand him over to police at . least once and threw him out aged 16. He is said to have been given an . Asbo and banned from coming into the neighbourhood, but he ignored it. He met his sidekick at the age of 11 . when his father, convicted wife-beater Leslie, 46, struck up a . relationship with Foster’s mother, Nicole Casey. Despite Foster painting himself as an . innocent party in court, locals say he was banned from pubs and shops in . his neighbourhood. Bowling’s estranged uncle, Robert . Allan, 49, a roofer, said: ‘He may be my flesh and blood but he deserves . to be strung up for what he did to that old man.’ An acquaintance of . the murderer added: ‘He’s the kind that will see a life sentence as a . badge of honour.’","Alan Greaves, 68, died following vicious attack in High Green, Sheffield .

BMW’s revolutionary new electric i3 car was unveiled to the world in Britain today, promising fun-filled green motoring at under 2p a mile. The new futuristic-looking green city run-around, said to be one of the most important in the German company's history, was revealed simultaneously in London, New York and Beijing. BMW engineers said that a full battery charge from empty will cost about £2 and will take it up to 100 miles. The fuel economy is equivalent to a conventionally-fuelled car doing around 425 miles to the gallon, they added, while a partially charged battery on an overnight charge will cost only 1.6p per mile. Images of the full production-ready version of the electric super-mini leaked out early on the internet, sparking global interest. Scroll down for video . BMW¿s revolutionary new electric i3 car was launched in London today against a backdrop of The Shard . First deliveries of the electric i3 will be in November priced from £25,680 - which includes a £5,000 taxpayer-funded ¿green¿ subsidy courtesy of the UK Government . The i3 was officially unveiled in London today following a leak which saw pictures of the car emerge on the internet beforehand . BMW's engineers says the fuel economy of their new electric model is equivalent to a conventionally fuelled car doing around 425 miles to the gallon . But now the covers have officially come . off the model that customers can buy or lease from showrooms. The event . was streamed live on the internet at 1.15pm UK time. First deliveries of the electric i3 . will be in November priced from £25,680 - which includes a £5,000 . taxpayer-funded ‘green’ subsidy courtesy of the UK Government. BMW is also introducing a ‘range-extender’ version  at £28,830, which features an additional 650cc two-cylinder petrol engine to maintain the battery charge and extend the range to between 160 miles and 186miles on one tank of fuel. This version is aimed at people who suffer from ‘range-anxiety’ – a fear of being left stranded before reaching their destination -  and has average emissions of just 13g/kilometre. BMW’s global sales and marketing director Dr Ian Robertson said: ’The i3 has re-written the rule book. After 100 years of landlines the mobile telephone opened up so many opportunities and changed the face of the communications industry. 'Electric vehicles will do the same for individual mobility. The car has been around for 130 years and today marks a change in the future of mobility. One thing the i3 will share with every other BMW is sheer driving pleasure.’ The car can be connected wirelessly to the driver’s smartphone so they can check the charge in the battery before and after a journey. An interior view of the i3 at the London launch today. An app connected to a driver's smartphone will let them know how much battery is left and send them in the direction of a charging point if needed . The electric vehicle was simultaneously revealed to audiences in New York, pictured, and Beijing while the main event took place in London . Leaked: Pictures of the BMW i3 have emerged on the internet ahead of its official launch . As it is driven around, the i3 also . keeps the driver in touch with traffic conditions, telling him or her . where to park, find a charging point and even when the next train is . leaving if you are heading out of town into the countryside. A phone app will let drivers know at . any time where they have parked their car – or guide them on foot to . their final  destination after they park up. A 'driving range assistant' linked to the car's sat-nav will look at the battery's charge and work out whether the destination is too far for the vehicle to go. If so, the assistant can suggest switching to a more economical driving mode or direct the driver to a public charging station. It even takes account of traffic jams, uphill climbs, and stop-start conditions ‘to make allowances for the energy required.’ Innovation: The German company is hoping its new electric car will be a breakthrough for the industry . The new car's clamshell doors open outwards to expose a futuristic interior, with hi-tech screens replacing many conventional dials . Also, to save energy, the electric . motor switches from ‘drive’ to ‘generator mode once the driver takes his . foot off the accelerator, feeding power into the lithium ion battery . and helping the car ‘brake itself’. BMW said: ’This  recharging effect is . speed sensitive which means the car ‘coasts’ with maximum efficiency at . high speeds and generates strong braking effect at low speeds.’ It noted: ‘Thinking ahead in city . traffic can allow the driver to carry out  75 per cent of braking . manoeuvres without applying the brake pedal.’ The i3 is rear-wheel drive powered by a 168bhp electric motor, and weighs less than 1,200kg thanks to a lightweight but super-strong carbon fibre-reinforced plastic and aluminium construction. It has a range of around 80 to 100 miles and can accelerate from rest to 62mph in just 7.2 seconds with a top speed of 93mph. The battery can re-charge 80 per cent of its power within three hours. Interior: Traditional dials have been replaced by digital screens inside the i3, according to pictures . Coming soon: The car will be launched on Monday in three 'mega-cities' - London, New York and Beijing . Difficulties: Many customers are put off electric cars by the scarcity of charging points for them . The British capital was chosen for the world premiere because of its trendy image and promotion of low-polluting cars which are exempt from London’s controversial Congestion Charge. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin is set to get a personal view of the car tomorrow. He said:  ‘It is fantastic to see a great brand like BMW introducing such a striking electric vehicle to the mainstream market. This shows that industry, like Government, is serious about this technology.’ The Government recently announced an extra £500million investment  – matched by the automotive industry – to boost  ultra-low emission vehicles: . ‘This is some of the most long-sighted and comprehensive support for these vehicles anywhere in the world and will put Britain in the vanguard of this growing market,' Mr McLoughlin said. The i3 is built in  Leipzig in Eastern Germany, where new production processes means the plant uses less energy, less water and produces less noise. The new car’s clamshell doors open outwards to expose a futuristic interior, with hi-tech screens replacing many conventional dials. Charge: Ahead of next week's UK launch, BMW is set to buy a stake in a pioneering British company which produces and installs half of the UK's charging points for electric cars . The i3 will be at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September, where it will be on show alongside the production version of the i8 hybrid supercar . Dr Robertson - the only Briton on the German firm’s board - said: ‘The BMW i3 heralds the dawn of a new era for individual mobility and for the BMW Group. 'It has strong emotional appeal, outstanding product substance and a guarantee of sheer driving pleasure. 'With this leading-edge vehicle and compelling price, we will provide customers with an attractive offer for electromobility.’ The i3 will be at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September, where it will be on show alongside the production version of the i8 hybrid supercar. The two models will kick-start a new ‘i’ family of electric BMW cars that could eventually include an i4 coupe and i5 saloon. Subsidised: Each model sold in the UK comes with a £5,000 payment from the British Government . Reverse: The i3 can accelerate from rest to 62mph in just 7.2 seconds with a top speed of 93mph . Ahead of next week’s UK launch, BMW is set to buy a stake in a pioneering British company which produces and installs half of the UK's charging points for electric cars. The German car-maker is set to invest up to £500,000 in Chargemaster which is based near Luton. The European Commission demands that 795,000 charging points are installed across the Continent by 2020. The UK Government is subsidising up to 75 per cent of the cost of domestic charging points, according to the British company's flotation documents. Annual European demand for electric vehicle charging infrastructure is expected to reach $1billion (£650million) by 2021. Chargemaster . makes money by supplying home, workplace and public charging units for . motor manufacturers such as Nissan, Renault and Toyota as well as local . authorities and supermarkets. The i3 is rear-wheel drive powered by a 168bhp electric motor, and weighs less than 1,200kg thanks to a lightweight but super-strong carbon fibre-reinforced plastic and aluminium construction . Growth in electric car use has been hampered by too few public charging points and exacerbated by a phenomenon known as ‘range anxiety’ – a fear by motorists that their batteries will run out of juice and leave them stranded. Chargemaster was set up by David Martell, the entrepreneur who made his first fortune from the creation of the Trafficmaster satellite navigation system, who owns 50 per cent of the company. Customers can also lease an i3 by putting down a deposit of £2,995 and paying £369 per month over 36 months. As part of the deal they can also borrow an X5 or a Z4 for a limited period of time depending on their needs.

Casey Anthony's parents reportedly have been selling children's toys and other possessions believed to belong to their dead granddaughter Caylee at a yard sale, two years after their daughter was acquitted of the two-year-old's murder in a sensational case that divided America. Cindy and George Anthony were disposing of items including teddy bears, heart-shaped boxes and a Winnie The Pooh backpack at a house in Mount Dora, Florida on June 28, according to a witness. The Anthonys were recognized by Florida resident Christina Werner who told Radaronline that she bought toys and children's clothing outside a home which is believed to belong to Casey Anthony's grandparents.

Ms Werner told Radar: 'I simply will never understand how these grandparents can put a price tag on Caylee’s items. 'I can understand Casey’s things, but I will never understand how they could part with these things at a yard sale!' There was no sign of their daughter Casey Anthony, who became a notorious and much-reviled figure, spending most of her time in hiding since she was acquitted of killing her daughter in July 2011.

A Tory councillor was forced to resign last night after suggesting inner-city children from a ‘coloured area’ would not be welcome at a proposed new school in the countryside. John Cherry, 73, said the youngsters could ‘escape into the forest’ and trigger a ‘sexual volcano’ because they had been ‘plucked from their natural surroundings’. Announcing his resignation last night, he said: ‘My remarks were plainly wrong. They were thoughtless and extremely foolish. I unreservedly apologise and withdraw them. I very much regret the distress this must have caused.’ Labour education spokesman Stephen Twigg called for David Cameron to condemn the comments. He said: ‘When a Tory councillor makes openly racist comments like these, it’s no  surprise people still think of the Conservatives as the nasty party.’ A Conservative Party spokesman said last night that the process had begun to suspend Mr Cherry, adding: ‘These comments are totally unacceptable.’ The high-performing state-run Durand Academy in Stockwell, South London, is planning to open a boarding school in an affluent rural area of West Sussex. It hopes to send 600 teenagers there every Monday morning for lessons and bring them back on Friday evenings free of charge, so they can enjoy an ‘Eton-style experience’ away from violent crime in their local area. But there has been strong opposition from people living near the disused boarding school in the quiet village of Stedham, overlooking the South Downs. They fear a ‘tranquil place’ would be ruined by ‘bringing Brixton to the countryside’. One resident even claimed the students would be ‘searched daily for weapons’. Education Secretary Michael Gove waded into the row, accusing those who oppose the plan of ‘trying to obstruct an inspirational project’, but it is Mr Cherry’s incendiary comments that have provoked the most anger. He said: ‘Ninety-seven per cent of pupils will be black or Asian. If they’re Chinese, they’ll rise to the top. If they’re Indian, they’ll rise to the top. If they’re Pakistani, they won’t. Plans: Former boarding school St Cuthman's School in Sussex which has been bought by the Durand Academy in Stockwell . ‘There are certain nationalities where hard work is highly valued. There are certain nationalities where they are uncertain what this hard work is all about. ‘If the children are not allowed out of the site then it will make them want to escape into the forest – it will be a sexual volcano.’ He added: ‘Stockwell is a coloured area – I have no problem with that.’ The row will be particularly uncomfortable for the Tories as it comes days after Mr Cameron was warned he must woo non-white voters to have any chance of winning the next election. Lord Ashcroft, the pollster and former Tory donor, said the party won just 16 per cent of the non-white vote at the general election in 2010. In a hard-hitting critique, he said: ‘We must do better than this – both because we should be a party for the whole country, and because we will find it increasingly difficult to win a majority without them.’ Apple of his eye: The academy, in Stockwell, is one of the best in London and is a favourite of education secretary Michael Gove . Dozens of residents attended a public meeting in the affluent nearby village of Milland, where actor Hugh Bonneville has a home, to oppose the Durand development for a variety of reasons, including traffic and the size of the project. But one unnamed resident said: ‘You must be wary about students who will have to be searched daily for weapons and knives.’ Mr Cherry has lived in the area for 40 years. He lives with his wife Priscilla a few hundred yards from Stedham. Anne Reynolds, chairman of the Woolbeding with Redford parish council, says the plans are ‘ill conceived’, and  she fears the village will be left with a ‘white elephant’. Shock: Durand Academy chief Greg Martin has described the attitude of residents as 'shocking' but has vowed to press on with the scheme . She added: ‘I can’t comment on what Councillor Cherry has said – we have had two public meetings and that has not been a view I have heard. But there is quite a lot of opposition – it’s a development the size of three superstores. ‘Where is the evidence that shows pupils’ attainment levels are improved by being in a rural environment? They would be better off building them a better school in Stockwell.’ Durand’s director of education, Greg Martin, said residents’ comments had been ‘shocking’ but he vowed to press ahead. The school is rated as outstanding by Ofsted. The staff and governors used the proceeds from Durand’s leisure and student accommodation business to buy Grade II-listed Cuthman’s school for £3.4million in 2010. Mr Martin added: ‘I’ve heard a few comments. It’s sad, but it makes us want to fight harder, and when this councillor sees the hard work and commitment from ethnic minorities, I’m sure he will change his tune. You will soon realise these are frankly nothing more than baseless prejudices.’","Inner-city state primary bought disused boarding school in Sussex .

When a group of travellers chose their latest settlement, it seems they underestimated the quality of the opposition. They found themselves pitched against the hardy regulars of Hoghton Cricket Club, and from that point there was only going to be one winner. Invoking ‘the spirit of the Ashes’, as the village cricketers themselves put it, and with a little help from Twitter, they defended their turf throughout the night with a human barricade. Scroll down for video . Victory for the cricket team: Travellers cleared from pitch after trying to set up camp in Hoghton, Lancashire . Battle: Members of Hoghton Cricket Club formed a human barricade around their pitch to stop more travellers setting up camp . Stand off: Police talk to players and supporters from Hoghton Cricket Club who refused to let more travellers invade their pitch . The rearguard action began after . caravans and a motorhome entered the ground, near Preston, on Monday . morning, and locals reported dozens more people asking for directions to . the pitch. Cricket club chairman Neil Eccles, 50, . one of the first on the scene, said: ‘This just isn’t the place for an . invasion of travellers. It is a nice rural village and there were lots . of people walking past who were horrified by what they saw. ‘We put the word out, used Twitter to . rally the local community and managed to barricade the entrance to stop . any more caravans getting on and ruining our ground.’ Players and staff from the local . league champions side, including president Rory McDonald, 51, set up a . rota to stand guard for 24 hours. In that time, Mr Eccles claimed, the travellers left rubbish on the wicket and human waste on the outfield. One motorhome even parked on the square, lovingly tended by Mr Eccles’s brother Darren, 40, the groundsman. Mr Eccles said: ‘Darren spends hours and hours on the ground when he’s not working or playing for our second team. ‘That was our worst fear, so when they . moved from the outfield to the square we went over to remonstrate and . they just laughed in our faces.’ Fighting back: Club president Rory McDonald with the trailer which was used to block out the travellers . Fury: Although the field has now been cleared, the club says the travellers damaged the cricket square and left rubbish and faeces . Police were called to the ground in . the shadow of historic Hoghton Tower, and stayed overnight to prevent an . altercation. The travellers left just before midday yesterday. Captain Phil Hurst, 30, who manned the . barricade until 7.15am before going to his job as a bank manager in . Manchester, said it was a ‘victory for team spirit’. He added: ‘Everyone at the club has other day jobs, but we got a rota going and all the lads have given up their time. ‘Preparing one wicket for a game on . Saturday takes our groundsman five hours and for them to come on and . wreck it is soul destroying. ‘When more of their convoy turned up in the night, the lads on the  barricade blocked them out and turned them away.’ Police were able to secure an . eviction notice only after the club had to cancel a series of events. Mr . Eccles said: ‘The club had to cancel its under 11s and under 13s . practice night, leaving 50 local youngsters disappointed, but this . inadvertently resulted in the  gypsies having to leave. ‘The police were able to serve an . eviction notice because they are interfering with community events, . otherwise their hands would have been tied.’ Dispute: Police were called in to prevent a 'breach of the peace' as the stand off continued . Barricade: A local tradesman volunteered to park his lorry in front of the entrance to keep travellers out . The stand-off began at 11am . on Monday when a local called Mr McDonald to warn him there were four . vehicles on the outfield. Mr McDonald rang Mr Eccles’s other . brother Russell, 48, a farmer and the club’s opening batsman, who made a . blockade with his car. They called in reinforcements in the form of a . tradesman’s lorry, and other players quickly arrived. Mr Eccles said: ‘We heard there were dozens more caravans in the village asking for the postcode. It was intimidating. ‘They were very aggressive and quoted . every bylaw in the book to prove they were right. They weren’t open for . discussion and told us they had every right to be there. ‘They threatened to stay for days. But . we stood our ground and took turns to man the barricade. I don’t think . they realise how much volunteer effort goes into the club.’ Victory: The club formed a barricade to prevent more travallers entering and they were eventually removed after the police and council were able to obtain a court order . Team effort: Mr Eccles said the players drew on the spirit of England's national team who are competing for the Ashes against Australia this summer . Lancashire Police said: ‘We were called to Hoghton Cricket Club at 12.33pm on Monday to reports of four caravans on the pitch. ‘Members of the local community placed . a vehicle across the entrance of the car park and prevented further . entry. 'That continued throughout the night and we remained at the scene . to prevent a breach of the peace.’","Alarm raised when caravans parked up on Hoghton Cricket Club's pitch .

Michael Gove has written a belated apology to one of his former teachers for indulging in ‘pathetic showing-off’ and coming up with ‘clever-dick’ questions in class. The Education Secretary wrote the extraordinary open letter to Danny Montgomery, who taught him French 30 years ago, to publicise this year’s Teaching Awards. Mr Gove, who wants teachers to clamp down on badly behaved pupils, confesses that he and his classmates at Robert Gordon’s College, a private school in Aberdeen, had viewed the ‘rookie’ teacher as ‘ripe for ragging’, or teasing. Sorry, sir: Michael Gove (pictured this week, left) has apologised to a former teacher for 'showing-off' when he was a 15-year-old schoolboy in Aberdeen (right) In his letter in the Radio Times to publicise the awards, which will be on BBC2 on Sunday, Mr Gove wrote: ‘You were, without any pretension or pomposity, attempting to coax a group of hormonal lads to look beyond familiar horizons and venture further. 'And all we could do was compete to think of clever-dick questions to embarrass you and indulge in pathetic showing-off at your expense.’ He added: ‘You wanted us to enjoy . some of the pleasure you had found in the very best that had been . thought and written. But we were a cocksure crew of precociously . assertive boys who recognised you were only a few years older – a rookie . in the classroom – and therefore ripe for ragging. And because we . misbehaved, we missed out. ‘But because you cared, you persevered. And for that you deserve my apology. And my thanks.’ Mr . Gove, 45, added: ‘So Danny, it may be too late to say I’m sorry. But, . as my mum told me, it’s never too late to set the record straight.’ Mr Montgomery, 55, who still teaches . at Robert Gordon’s College, said yesterday: ‘Even in those days, Michael . stood out.

One mother in San Antonio, Texas made the ultimate sacrifice, offering her life to save those of her two young children when an oncoming car threatened to hit them. 28-year-old single mother Sharon Ledesma was walking her son Dominic, 11, and daughter Mallory, 8, to their grandmother's house early Wednesday morning around 7am, when it was still dark outside. The young family was more than halfway across Culebra Road when they stepped off a median and into the path of a car turning left. Sacrifice: 28-year-old single mother Sharon Ledesma died Thursday night after being taken off life support. She was hit by a car early Wednesday morning and helped save the lives of her two young children by pushing them out of the way . Crash: The accident scene shows that the young family wasn't using a crosswalk when they were struck by the car. Their belongings are pictured scattered on the road . A mother's reaction: Ledesma pushed the two children out of the way and was hit the hardest by the car, police officers said . Ledesma then pushed her two children out of the way and was hit with the brunt of the force from the oncoming car, according to police officers on the scene. Dominic suffered a broken collarbone and Mallory a fractured pelvis but both are recovering fine thanks to the protection of their mother. 'She must have protected Mallory and Dominic,' her sister Priscilla Ledesma told KENS 5. 'I'm proud of my sister for doing that, but what mother wouldn't do that for her kids'. Family: A picture from Ledesma's Facebook profile seems to show her with her children. 11-year-old Dominic and 8-year-old Mallory were also injured in the accident, but are recovering fine . Last goodbye: Ledesma was kept on life support so that her organs could be donated after she died. Her children said one last goodbye to their mother Thursday before she was taken off life support . Ledesma herself was not so lucky. Doctors couldn't revive her, so she was put on life support so her organs could be donated. 'We were just hoping for the best and she just never came out of it. So we decided as a family that it's time,' Priscilla Ledesma told KABB. Tough decision: Ledesma's sister Priscilla said the family decided to take the young mother off of life support Thursday . Honoring: A large group of Ledesma's friends and family gathered at the site where she was hit for a candlelight vigil in her honor Thursday night . That happened Thursday night, just as Dominic was going into surgery for his collarbone. The children were brought in for one last moment with their mom before she passed away. 'It was very, very difficult for the kids,' Ledesma's grandmother Josie Inouye, 67, told the San Antonio Express-News. 'Dominic, he took it so hard'. The rest of Ledesma's family and friends heard about her passing at a candlelight vigil in her honor that night. No charges are expected to be filed against the driver of the car that killed Ledesma. In a video report for KABB, the woman looked visibally torn up over the incident, sobbing as she talked to a police officer. An accident: Local news station KABB showed footage of a woman sobbing to a police officer, who they inferred was the driver of the vehicle that hit Ledesma and her two children. No charges are expected to be filed against her . 'We're not blaming her, it was just an accident. She [doesn't] have to blame herself ' said Larry Diaz, one of Ledesma's family members. As of Friday, Mallory had been released from the hospital and her brother is also doing fine, recovering from his surgery. Ledesma's family is now fundraising to pay their medical bills and for a funeral since she was uninsured.","Sharon Ledesma, 28, was walking her 11-yeare-old son and 8-year-old daughter to their grandmother's house early Wednesday morning .

Petrol and diesel cars would be banned entirely from Britain’s roads by 2040 under Liberal Democrat plans to force everyone to go green . Nick Clegg’s party has unveiled proposals to only allow ultra-low carbon vehicles, such as electric cars and hybrids, by that year. However, although ordinary petrol and diesel cars would be banned, such vehicles would still be allowed for freight purposes. Thing of the past: Lib Dems want only ultra-green low emissions cars on the roads within 30 years . The move would pile further pressure on hard-pressed motorists, who are also having to cope with sky-high fuel bills. And – to attract the anger of drivers even more – the Lib Dems would also like to see councils given the power to impose road tolls to ease congestion in city centres. The plans, which have the support of the party leadership, will be voted on by delegates at next month’s Lib Dem conference in Glasgow. The controversial motion will be moved by Lord Teverson, co-chair of the party’s official committee on environment and climate change, and a former manager of international freight company Exel. If members vote yes, the policy will have to be included in the Lib Dem manifesto for the next election. The idea of banning ordinary cars is contained in a policy paper entitled ‘Transition to a Zero Carbon Britain’ which will be debated in Glasgow. It states: ‘By 2040, only ultra-low carbon vehicles will be permitted on UK roads for non-freight purposes.’ In the years until the ban comes into force, the policy paper reveals that Lib Dems want to charge higher taxes on petrol and diesel cars to persuade motorists to move towards greener alternative. Going green: The cars clampdown is part of a raft of environmental policies being pushed by Nick Clegg's party at its annual conference next month . Cleaner vehicles would attract a subsidy, paid for by a higher ‘vehicle emissions duty’ on less environmentally friendly cars. The Lib Dems also want to introduce a system of road pricing – that is, tolls – in congested areas. While the Coalition ruled out imposing tolls on the existing road network during this side of the election, no promises have been given for the second half of the decade. The document said that party would prepare for the ‘introduction of a revenue-neutral system of road pricing and support local authorities introducing road pricing in congested areas'. The Lib Dems also want to replace air passenger duty with a ‘per-plane duty, charged in proportion to the carbon emissions created by that journey’. As part of the party’s plans to create a ‘zero-carbon’ Britain, the Lib Dems could also embrace nuclear power and shale gas exploration. The policy document says that gas fracking should be allowed as long as ‘regulations controlling pollution and protecting local environmental quality are strictly enforced, planning decisions remain with local authorities and local communities are fully consulted over extraction and fully compensated for all damage to the local landscape’.","Nick Clegg's party wants everyone to drive low carbon cars within 30 years .

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 12:36 EST, 9 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:51 EST, 9 January 2013 . A well-known music promoter has admitted making anti-semitic comments towards a Jewish Labour MP during a drunken tirade at a star-studded awards ceremony. Luciana Berger was shocked by Philip Hayes' racially abusive rant at the Liverpool Music Awards last year. Hayes, who has a history of alcohol abuse, suggested that the MP was Israeli rather than British, and later shouted, 'I f****** hate Jewish people' in her direction. Although he contacted her via Facebook to apologise the next day, magistrates fined him £175 after he pleaded guilty to two charges of racially aggravated disorder. Abuse: Philip Hayes, left, admitted making anti-semitic remarks to Labour MP Luciana Berger, right . Liverpool Magistrates' Court heard that Hayes, 53, and Ms Berger, MP for Liverpool Wavertree, were both guests at the VIP event on November 17, which was attended by the likes of Spice Girl Mel C and X-Factor stars Craig Colton and Rebecca Ferguson. They started discussing the Israel-Palestine conflict, and a drunk Hayes made comments which upset and offended the 31-year-old politician. 'During Mr Hayes and Miss Berger's conversation about Gaza, Mr Hayes made a number of remarks about Jewish people,' prosecutor Amanda Haycock said. 'He said, ""All Jewish people have money,"" and began talking about a Rolls Royce.' The music mogul referred to a prominent local solicitor as a 'f****** Jewish t***', and accused Ms Berger of regarding Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as her national leader. Fined: The music promoter was ordered to pay a £175 fine over the drunken tirade . Later in the evening, the two crossed paths again. Ms Haycock described how Hayes shouted, 'I f****** hate Jewish people' in the direction of the MP and her friend. 'As Miss Berger was the only Jewish person there she felt the comment was directed at her and she called a cab and left,' the prosecutor said. The next day Hayes wrote to Ms Berger on Facebook apologising for his abusive language. However, after a complaint was made to Merseyside Police, the force's dedicated hate crime unit launched an investigation into the incident. During a police interview, Hayes claimed he could not remember exactly what he said, but admitted he had used foul and insulting language. His lawyer George White told the court his client had 'fallen off the wagon' after five years battling a drink problem. Star-studded: The event where they met was also attended by celebrities such as Spice Girl Mel C, seen here arriving at the bash . VIP: Liverpudlian X-Factor stars Craig Colton, left, and Rebecca Ferguson, right, were at the awards ceremony . 'The fact that he was drunk let him down that night and the words spoken were completely out of character,' he said. 'He has let down many of his friends from ethnic and diverse backgrounds.' Mr White blamed Hayes's drinking on 'financial problems' at The Picket, the legendary Liverpool gig venue he runs which launched the career of Elvis Costello, the La's and the Coral. 'I sincerely apologise for the hurt and offence my behaviour has caused Miss Berger,' Hayes said in statement read by his solicitor outside court. 'Prior to this offence for over 30 years I have always tried to fight racism in every form in my personal and professional life. 'I have tried to promote tolerance and celebration of all races and creeds. 'I don't believe the words I spoke on that night reflect who I am, but I accept that I said them and caused offence by uttering them.'","Philip Hayes admitted abusing Luciana Berger at Liverpool Music Awards .

"By . Alex Greig . PUBLISHED: . 08:15 EST, 7 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:31 EST, 10 July 2013 . An American Airlines flight attendant is suing the airline after allegations were made by her colleagues that she had smuggled her pet rats inside her underwear and pantyhose onto an international flight. Long Island flight attendant Louann Giambattista, 55, says the accusations have resulted in her being blacklisted by customs for more than a year. The 33-year industry veteran is seeking damages for 'debilitating anxiety' and post-traumatic stress disorder from the airline. Suing: Louann Giambattista was routinely scrutinized by customs officials after colleagues alleged she smuggled rats onto planes in her pants . Ratted out: Louann Giambattista's colleagues told ICE officials they suspected she had smuggled rats onboard an American Airlines flight in her underwear and hosiery . In February 2012, a pilot reported that Giambattista had 'a bulge in [her] pocket' and saw 'what he thought was a live pet,' according to papers filed in Brooklyn federal court. Another colleague reported that on a flight to Miami that same day, she saw Giambattista feeding a pet rat. Giambattista claims that the bread roll in a paper cup was not for feeding a rat but rather herself, and that the cup was to avoid looking unprofessional in front of passengers. According to the court papers, colleagues on the Miami flight smelled a rat and dobbed Giambattista in to customs officials upon landing in Florida. Rat race: As a result of the allegations of rat-smuggling, American Airlines put a flag on Giambattista's passport but wouldn't take her off international flights . She says she was questioned and had her luggage searched for more than an hour, but the agents didn't find any rats. Nevertheless, Giambattista claims the airline put a flag on her passport as a result of the accusations, meaning that every trip through customs became a lengthy ordeal and ICE agents bullied her and threatened her with a strip search, and that it became 'nearly impossible for [her] to report to work.' Rat-finks: Despite Giambattista's colleague's claims, no rats were ever found about her person . According to the New York Post, Giambattista is an admitted animal lover, but her lawyer says she knows there's a time and a place for pets. 'Everybody has pets - she has her pets at home, not at work,' Stephen Morelli said. 'She’s not a nut. They’re making her out to be a nut.' 'She’s got a lot of different pets. She had the rat - it died.' Giambattista told the Post that the claims she smuggled a rat on board a flight are 'absurd' and 'patently false'. 'There was no reason for it,' she said. 'People say, ""There must have been a reason"" but there was none.' She says she was made an example of in front of colleagues and questioned in a communal break room where other colleagues could witness her interrogation.","Louann Giambattista, 55, was accused of smuggling pet rats onto an American Airlines flight last year .

"By . Samantha Brick . PUBLISHED: . 09:51 EST, 5 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:47 EST, 7 August 2013 . Journalist Samantha Brick has been on the receiving end of online abuse but believes the #TwitterSilence campaign was a waste of time . Sunday 4th August was a day to celebrate, not just because it was my youngest sister’s 20th birthday, but also because on a certain social network there was a distinct lack of the usual pompous, self-promoting prattle. In case you missed it – then let me enlighten you: some of Britain’s foremost ‘twitterers’, who also happen to be ‘feminists’ (although their definition of the term seems to change by the day) had – in a spectacular paddy – decided to ‘protest’ against Twitter and not use it on Sunday 4th August. The reason? Certain opinion formers had received abusive Tweets and, even though Twitter had already caved into their demands of formulating an abuse button, forged ahead - galvanizing their followers with a 24 hour protest. Heaven! This meant that they and their merry band of toadies would neither be indulging in the usual self-congratulatory claptrap or selling themselves via inane tweets for a whole 24 hours. The usual suspects who took part in '#twittersilence' – who primarily use the site to flog themselves and their god awful products - included Myleene Klass, Gok Wan, Kirstie Allsopp, Jenny Eclair and Richard Madeley. Naturally a Twitter-lite Sunday was chosen for the ‘protest’ -  how on earth would those hallowed celebrities and writers truly cope if they couldn’t promote the usual tat and self-promoting baloney they persistently foist on us the other six days of the week? You’d be forgiven for assuming that I too joined the hallowed ones in their protest – after all I’ve received death threats, crude insults and the like ever since I penned ‘that’ piece about being beautiful last year. But you would be wrong if you presumed that I would entertain the silly season’s latest luvvie cause. You see I don’t subscribe to the UK’s version of the ‘sisterhood’: I adore my husband, I’m proud of the fact he comes first in my life and I come first in his. I’m unrepentant of the fact that I prepare a meal for him every night in my spick and span home. I could have joined in with the 'feminists' and listed my own impressive roll call of insults – but why bother? The ‘threats’ (truthfully they're just mindless prattle) are as likely to be acted on as I’m to be invited to ‘sups’ at Ms Moran’s house. For it was Caitlin Moran who led the #twittersilence campaign. Lucky you if you don’t know who Ms Moran is! A ‘writer’, perhaps best known for wittering on about popular culture in a broadsheet and emphasising her point in SHOUTY CAPITALS (and I thought it was only my Dad – who left school at 14 – who resorted to such writing). Writer Caitlin Moran (left) led the #TwitterSilence campaign in protest against online trolls and presenter Kirstie Allsopp (right) was another celebrity to take part in the Sunday silence . Ms Moran can do no wrong in the eyes of the chattering classes –Jemima Khan and her ilk. Naturally then, when she decided to take a stand against ‘twitter abuse’ she also encouraged her followers to do the same. This from a woman who has tweeted that Catholics 'hate women and gays and f*** kids'. Moran and her ilk are, to my mind, little more than jumped up attention seekers desperate for a cause – and any ole cause will do. As for Mary Beard, I fear her university and broadcasting career have been eclipsed by her dogged whinnying about the threats she’s apparently received. I don’t deny it - it’s horrible to be on the receiving end of such abuse. But I’ve performed my own reality checks in the past: is someone really going to announce on Twitter that they’re going to rape, bomb or do something to one or other of my bodily parts? Highly doubtful. Furthermore it’s a waste of public money to insist the authorities investigate such messages. Which is why whenever I receive such missives I treat them with the contempt they deserve – deleting them and getting on with my life. Tweet relief: Samantha and showbiz editor Dan Wootton were two journalists happy to see Caitlin and co. off Twitter for the day . Summer 2013 isn’t a period in time we’ll look back on as women with our heads held high. The bonkers ‘project’  Everyday Sexism hasn't helped (which I have tweeted about – calling it the ‘he looked at me, therefore he wants to rape me’ website). And now this! We women are in danger of replicating the mass hysteria last seen in the Salem Witch Trials. I’m ashamed right now to be a woman when I read some of the foul diatribe aimed at men. Why? Because stunts like this really do prove that we are the weaker sex. Was Twitter any the worse for the lack of celebrity posturing yesterday? Was it filled with abuse? No, it wasn’t. In fact many of Moran's happy band continued to tweet and retweet throughout the day - laughably undermining their objective. As for yesterday's 'campaign', channelling the spirit of Caitlin Moran I have this to say: ‘#twittersilence? TWITTER FAIL DUDE. Samantha says that she doesn't subscribe to the UK's version of 'sisterhood' and is proud that her husband Pascal is the top priority in her life .","Group of media opinion formers took part in their own protest on 4th August .
