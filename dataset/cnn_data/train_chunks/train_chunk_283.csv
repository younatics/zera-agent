"London (CNN) -- London's inaugural Technology Week is underway, as the United Kingdom's capital promotes its tech stars and shows it can compete with Silicon Valley. Here are five companies to watch, as they pitch to make it big. Squawka . Big data is a huge topic at London Technology Week, with focus on how we can use it to empower us. One company taking that big data memo and maximizing it is Squawka. It's a real-time football data company that is already delivering tons of data on football matches every week, allowing its users to become champions in their Fantasy Football leagues. But the bigger picture is all about empowering clubs, coaches, and pundits to understand what is happening with the real game. Swiftkey . The number one third-party keyboard app for Android phones, Swiftkey is a must-have for the OS. Starting in London, and then setting up offices in San Francisco, the app has just gone free on the Google platform. If that wasn't enough to encourage growth, the company also announced it will launch an iOS version for iOS 8 now that Apple has said they will allow it. That's another potential 500 million customers overnight. Nice. Seene . Chances are you might not have heard about Seene, but earlier this year the company won the Smart UK award for UK's Most Innovative Mobile Company. It creates 3D imaging on the iPhone by just using the phone processing. Imagine women being able to take a picture of a dress they like and send it to others to look at in 3D -- or 360 degree images to share. With the 3D imaging space heating up, this is certainly one to watch. Damson Audio . Audio companies are getting forgotten these days, as more of us turn to music on the go via our phones. Damson Audio is trying to change that, with speaker systems that use the environment around you to boost the sound. It's an adventurous project and one that is already getting traction. In 2012 it won best start-up from the UK Trade & Investment department. Blippar . The company deals with augmented reality and, in particular, augmented reality advertising. It now has offices in London, New York and beyond. It describes itself as a lens through which the real world can be spontaneously ""unlocked"" and converted into content-rich, interactive experiences and it's already having huge success with that vision. Clients include Budweiser, Heinz, and Nissan. READ MORE: Virtual reality's new reality .

"(CNN) -- Chris Pratt is officially capital-""F"" Famous. It's not just because he's the star of the No. 1 movie at the box office, ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" or because he's endlessly charming. And it's not just his physical transformation or his stories about flashing his ""Parks & Recreation"" co-star Amy Poehler, although none of that hurts. 'Guardians of the Galaxy' scores record-breaking weekend . No, it's when your old high school yearbook photos start having value on the Internet that you know you've really made it. Thanks to the generosity of Reddit user ""warped_and_bubbling,"" Pratt fans -- whose ranks seem to grow by the hour -- have been ""aww!""-ing at the 35-year-old actor's senior year pic and a ""slightly less dorky"" junior photo, along with a couple of others. The Reddit user recalled Pratt being ""the kind of guy who could crack a joke in class and never get in trouble for it, and one of those students who was popular with everyone,"" which sounds a lot like the guy we know today. Before he became famous as the goofy Andy on ""Parks & Rec,"" Pratt was better known as ""the class clown,"" evidence of which can be seen in one of the yearbook photos. As described in the New York Times, Pratt grew up in Lake Stevens, Washington, an athlete and the youngest of three who wasn't averse to performing in school assemblies. According to the paper, Pratt didn't have any big plans after high school graduation, and he eventually found himself in Maui. (As the actor recounted on DJ Whoo Kid's radio show, that era involved living in a van with a friend, smoking weed daily and listening to Dr. Dre's ""2001"" so much he can still rap ""Forgot About Dre"" lyric for lyric.) It was while working as a waiter that Pratt, who'd done a few plays and a little dinner theater, got his first break into Hollywood: Rae Dawn Chong happened to be dining at the restaurant where he worked, and a spontaneous chat led to a gig in his screen debut, ""Cursed Part 3."" ""I thought it was the best thing I ever read. It probably was the best thing I ever read. I hadn't read a whole lot of anything up to that point,"" Pratt joked of the short film. ""It was like one of the famous Hitchcock push-ins. My world changed. I knew it right at that moment."" Obviously, Pratt's come a long way since ""Cursed Part 3."" He's still clowning around, but now it can make millions.","A Reddit user has shared photos of Chris Pratt in high school .

"New York (CNN) -- Authorities and medical experts warned Friday that a rabies outbreak in Central Park could spread from raccoons to humans. Health investigators have confirmed reports of 28 rabid raccoons in or near Central Park this month and last, compared with just three cases from 2003 through November. The reason is not clear, but the city's health department -- which has been monitoring the situation since December -- is taking it seriously: It's working with the parks department and others to increase surveillance and vaccinate wild raccoons in New York's Central Park, Morningside Park and Riverside Park. Dr. Charles Rupprecht, chief of the rabies program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Friday that ideal conditions in Central Park for animals -- few predators -- could exacerbate an outbreak. ""Urban ecosystems sometimes have the ideal measures,"" he said. ""When you get an infectious agent like rabies, it tends to have these untoward effects, meaning an outbreak."" Similar outbreaks of rabies in Eastern Pennsylvania and Washington, however, were contained through the same measures that officials in New York are following, he said. In addition to the increased surveillance and vaccinations, authorities in New York are suggesting that visitors to city parks keep pets on a leash and be wary of raccoons they see during the day. Raccoons are nocturnal animals who rarely venture out in the daylight. Being out during the day ""means they are probably carrying rabies,"" said Marlene Elizondo, a nurse with the International SOS, which offers medical care and consulting services to companies, nonprofits and other organizations. ""In such a condensed area like New York, it's more likely that a human would come into contact with"" a rabid raccoon, Elizondo said. Celina De Leon, a spokeswoman for the New York Department of Health, urged park visitors to alert authorities if they see any animal behaving strangely. Health officials received 10 reports of rabid raccoons in Manhattan last year, but eight of them were in December. It confirmed only one case from 2003 through 2008. Most of the cases it has seen in the past two months were from the northern part of Central Park, between 79th and 110th streets. If left untreated, rabies will infect the central nervous system and ultimately cause death. Health professionals encourage people who come in contact with infected animals to seek medical attention immediately. New York's health department says that ""while raccoons, skunks, foxes and coyotes are considered high-risk sources of virus, bats are the most common source of infection for people across the United States.""","28 rabid raccoons reported in New York park in past two months .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Microsoft is investigating a report that workers at a Chinese plant that manufactures its Xbox game systems have threatened mass suicide in a pay dispute, according to a statement by the company's Hong Kong office. ""Microsoft takes working conditions in the factories that manufacture its products very seriously, and we are currently investigating this issue,"" the statement said. CNN has not been able to confirm the full details of the dispute, but Foxconn, the plant owner, and Microsoft did respond to inquiries. The Chinese contractor acknowledged in a statement Thursday that 150 workers had protested at its Wuhan factory on January 4. The incident, the company said, stemmed from a decision to transfer all employees to an alternate production line. And though it was later resolved ""successfully and peacefully,"" 45 workers have since chosen to resign. ""The welfare of our employees is our top priority and we are committed to ensuring that all employees are treated fairly and that their rights are fully protected,"" the company statement said. Foxconn produces brand-name electronics for companies such as Microsoft and Apple. A Microsoft spokeswoman later added that the controversy was derived from employee grievances in ""staffing assignments and transfer policies, not working conditions."" Overheard: U.S. too dependent on foreign manufacturing . Foxconn apparently offered disgruntled workers the option to transfer or resign, whereby they would receive ""all salary and bonuses due, according to length of service,"" said a Microsoft spokeswoman. ""After the protest, the majority of workers chose to return to work. A smaller portion of those employees elected to resign,"" the statement said. Foxconn raised workers' pay twice at its factory in Shenzhen in 2010 after a spate of suicides, Chinese state media reported at the time. ""We have a stringent Vendor Code of Conduct that spells out our expectations, and we monitor working conditions closely on an ongoing basis and address issues as they emerge,"" Microsoft's statement added. ""Microsoft is committed to the fair treatment and safety of workers employed by our vendors and to ensuring conformance with Microsoft policy."" After the 2010 suicides at Foxconn, the company said it was taking measures to improve workers' lives, including organizing recreational activities, calling in Buddhist monks to offer spiritual consolation and setting up a 24-hour help line. Foxconn, one of the world's top electronics manufacturers, also makes products for companies such as Dell, Hewlett Packard and Sony. It employed at estimated 800,000 employees in China in October 2010.","NEW: 150 workers had protested at its Wuhan factory on January 4, Foxconn reports .

"(CNN) -- Denny McLain is a recognizable name to almost any baseball fan, especially in Detroit, where he played most of his MLB career. But even his best friends don't recognize him after a 162-pound weight loss. ""I met a friend yesterday. I hadn't seen him in a year. He was sitting two tables across from me,"" McLain said. ""He didn't recognize me. He finally said, 'It's not you, only half of you.' I said, 'The other half is gone."" When McLain broke into pro baseball, he weighed around 185 pounds. He was known during his playing days for consuming a case of Pepsi every day. This habit, he said, added 10 pounds a year to his 6-foot-1-inch frame. McLain made a life-changing decision to have bariatric surgery last June. Bariatric surgery can be done a few different ways -- either by reducing the size of the stomach with a gastric band, by removing a portion of the stomach (often called a sleeve gastrectomy) or by resecting and re-routing the small intestines to a small stomach pouch, known as gastric bypass surgery. McLain had a sleeve gastrectomy. McLain said his stomach once weighed about 55 ounces. It now weighs about 4 ounces. Since the surgery, McLain has lost 162 pounds. He won't say exactly what he weighs now, but ""it's the closest I have ever been to my playing days weight."" ""He's doing remarkable,"" said McLain's physician, Dr. Carl Pesta. ""He's followed the plan. He's stayed on the plan."" While concern for his health played a role, McLain said it was his wife's condition, not his, that prompted him to make this major life change. Sharon McLain was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease a year ago. ""The quickness of the disease has been quite shocking,"" McLain said. ""My doctors both took me aside and said, 'Sharon is sick. Two things can happen. One is good. One is bad. The good thing: You have heart attack and die. Bad news: If you have a stroke and don't die, who is going to take care of you? How much help can you be?' "" McLain said his wife has an athlete's competitive nature in her, thanks in part to her father. Lou Boudreau was an eight-time MLB all-star as a player, and manager and member of Baseball's Hall of Fame. Sharon has lost her sense of balance, McLain said, and has difficulty walking. But she's ""a fighter."" ""It's a battle every day,"" he said of Parkinson's. ""You never have two good days in a row."" McLain only eats one meal a day, snacking on nuts and drinking flavored water the rest of the day. upwave: Try it now! Drink more water challenge . ""That's not a diet I would recommend for every(one), but it seems to work for him,"" Pesta said. ""He has his energy back; he is moving well."" McLain was known as a carefree player on and off the field, though he had his share of ups and downs. In 1968, he became the last pitcher to win 31 games in a season (a record many think never will be broken due to the different handling of pitchers today). He was the Cy Young winner, the Most Valuable Player Award winner and on the cover of Time magazine that season. He was also an excellent organist -- a talent that evolved into a side career, including an endorsement deal for Hammond Organs, playing on ""The Ed Sullivan Show,"" headlining performances in Las Vegas, and cutting a pair of albums. In true McLain style, he bought his own airplane and learned to fly it himself. He was also suspended in 1970 for being linked to a gambling ring. He has served time in prison twice, for cocaine possession in 1985 and for embezzlement and money laundering in 1996. He was in bankruptcy court three times. His wife divorced him during his second prison stint, but the couple remarried after his release. In 1992, his oldest daughter, Kristin McLain-Sutherland, was killed by a drunk driver, only three days after her wedding day. On the day McLain spoke to CNN, it was the anniversary of her death. ""We've only had two bumps -- the day I lost my daughter, a monster bump, and the last 13 to14 months, with Sharon's illness,"" he said. ""Life throws bumps at everybody."" While his wife cheered for McLain during his playing days, now it's the other way around. ""The worst part is the depression, such serious depression,"" McLain said of her diagnosis. ""Nobody likes to live like this. You need cheerleaders around you all the time."" It's easier for him to be there for her now with his weight loss. ""I was in a wheelchair 75% of the time"" before the surgery, he said. ""I have a real bad right knee -- when you are carrying around another 162 pounds, it really took its toll. I was embarrassed by that."" McLain now mentors others who have gone through the bariatric procedure. ""You have to deal with it,"" he tells them. ""Anybody out there who has this problem, we can call it 'being fat' or 'heavyset' or 'big boned' -- whatever you want to call it. I was fat. We're all kind of sheepish about it."" McLain now fills his days with public appearances, promoting his two books, ""Nobody's Perfect,"" and ""I Told You Nobody's Perfect."" He also keeps up with his seven grandchildren, attending many of their sporting events. And he helps raise money for other causes, including the Ted Williams Museum in Florida. Williams was manager of the Washington Senators; he and McLain often battled during McLain's short stint with the team. ""It's been 35 years since I have been in this sort of shape,"" he said. ""I can do things now I could never do.""","Denny McLain was an MLB pitcher for the Detroit Tigers .

"(CNN) -- Verizon Wireless has fired employees connected to a breach of records from a cell phone used by President-elect Barack Obama this year, a Verizon source said Friday. An Obama spokesman said Verizon Wireless workers looked through an old phone's billing records. The source would not say how many people were terminated but said ""we now consider this matter closed."" Verizon reported the breach Thursday, and Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs said the transition team had been notified Wednesday. Gibbs said the president-elect no longer uses that phone, which has been inactive for months. The fired employees were hired ""to take care of customers,"" the Verizon source said, and were not authorized to access customer records unless asked to do so by the customer. The source also said the employees in question could not have read text messages, if Obama sent or received them, and would not have been able to access the content of any voice mail messages, although they would have been able to see whether any had been left. ""This was some employees' idle curiosity,"" the source said, adding that records of no other customers of note were breached. Ari Schwartz of the Center for Democracy and Technology said the employees probably had access to the dates and times of calls, the length of calls and the telephone numbers of those Obama spoke with. Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said Thursday that the company initially put all employees who had access to the account, ""whether authorized or not,"" on leave during an investigation. McAdam said the device on the account was a simple voice flip-phone, not a BlackBerry or other smartphone designed for e-mail or other data services, meaning none of Obama's e-mail could have been accessed. Verizon Wireless, meanwhile, has launched a separate internal investigation to determine whether Obama's information was shared only among employees or whether ""the information of our customer had in any way been compromised outside our company, and this investigation continues,"" McAdam said in an internal e-mail obtained by CNN. The company has alerted ""the appropriate federal law enforcement authorities,"" McAdam said. CNN's Brian Todd and Ed Henry contributed to this report .","Source wouldn't say how many fired, but says Verizon considers matter closed .

"(CNN) -- Video of Oscar Pistorius re-enacting how he says he killed his girlfriend was illegally obtained by the Australian television network that aired it Sunday, a lawyer for the former Olympian said. The network says that isn't so. Channel Seven's ""Sunday Night"" included the video in an hourlong report on the case against Pistorius, who is on trial for murder in the February 2013 shooting death of Reeva Steenkamp. Pistorius, 27, admits firing the bullets that killed Steenkamp, but he says he mistakenly thought he was defending himself from an intruder. Prosecutors say the two had an argument and he deliberately murdered the model and law school graduate, who was 29. The video shows the disabled athlete walking on the stumps of his legs -- without his prosthetics -- while pretending to aim a handgun. Pistorius is also seen with his prosthetic legs, carrying his sister down a set of stairs, which is intended to demonstrate how he says he carried Steenkamp. There was no comment in court about the video during the trial Monday. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel seemed to be trying to bait a witness into mentioning it, which could have opened the door to having it admitted in court, said CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps. But the witness, South African Paralympic team doctor Wayne Derman, did not refer to the video. After his testimony, lead defense lawyer Barry Roux indicated that he planned to close his case but wanted to consult Pistorius first. Judge Thokozile Masipa adjourned the court until Tuesday morning, when the defense is expected to rest. Video map of events . The video was produced in October by a U.S. company hired by his defense team to help ""visually map the events on the night of the accident"" in preparation for the trial, Pistorius lawyer Brian Webber said in a statement to CNN. The company, The Evidence Room, used the video to produce a ""forensic animation"" of the fatal events, Webber said. The defense never introduced it into the ongoing trial. ""We wish to make it very clear that the material that has been aired was obtained illegally and in breach of the nondisclosure agreement with The Evidence Room,"" Webber said. ""Its usage also constitutes a breach of privilege as this material was produced for trial purposes on the instructions of a commissioner, and the ownership of the copyright vests in the commissioner. No permission for the disclosure thereof has been given."" CNN reached out to representatives of The Evidence Room for comment Sunday, and a representative responded Monday that ""there will be no comment at this time pending the conclusion of trial."" The broadcast included an interview with Scott Roder, the investigator who produced the video. Webber accuses the broadcaster of illegally purchasing the video and of violating a promise not to air it until after the trial is concluded. The broadcast of the material is ""a staggering breach of trust and an invasion of the family's privacy,"" the lawyer said. ""Whilst we cannot imagine how any of the footage would not support Oscar's version, we will only be in a position to comment further once we have had the opportunity to study what has been aired,"" he said. 'Heart of the case' Mark Llewellyn, the executive producer for ""Sunday Night,"" issued a statement defending the use of the video. ""We would not have run the footage if we thought we had obtained it illegally,"" he said. ""The material shown on Sunday Night goes to the heart of both the prosecution and defense cases, including the account provided by Oscar Pistorius."" The video included Pistorius putting on his prosthetics to show how quickly he could do so after firing the gun. He is also shown rushing across the floor on his stumps when prompted, to demonstrate how fast he could move without his prosthetic legs. At the trial's conclusion, the judge will have to decide whether Pistorius genuinely made a mistake or deliberately murdered his girlfriend. If Masipa does not believe the athlete thought there was an intruder, she will find him guilty of murder and sentence him to a prison term ranging from 15 years to life. South Africa does not have the death penalty. If Masipa accepts that Pistorius did not know that Steenkamp was the person he was shooting at, she could find him guilty of culpable homicide, a lesser charge than murder, or acquit him, according to Phelps, the CNN legal analyst. A verdict of culpable homicide would leave the sentence at Masipa's discretion. CNN's Robyn Curnow, Edwin Mesa and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","The defense expects to rest Tuesday, lawyer Barry Roux says .

"(CNN) -- ""You can take my Fendi Baguette, you can take my ring and my watch, but don't take my Manolo Blahniks,"" begs Carrie Bradshaw while being mugged at gunpoint. It's no use. The heartless thief takes her precious strappy sandals anyway. Ok, so while it's a pretty far-fetched story line -- how many criminals are going to spot a designer heel two meters away? -- it does point to the ""Sex and the City"" character's unhealthy obsession with the shoe label. Indeed, Manolo Blahniks were as much a part of the hit TV show's lexicon as Cosmopolitans and Rampant Rabbits. The six-year series introduced the Blahnik brand to millions of women across the world -- even if they could never actually afford them. Of course, Carrie's shoe infatuation wasn't just the stuff of fiction. Actor Sarah Jessica Parker -- who won four Golden Globes for her portrayal of the sassy New York columnist from 1998 to 2004 -- is a Manolo Blahnik diehard for real. So when she called up the coveted shoe company's chief executive, George Malkemus, on the off-chance he'd want to create a range together, she was delighted when the business mogul ""took on this little pipsqueak."" ""I was terrified at picking up the phone and being bold enough to say to George: 'Would you ever consider a partnership?'"" says 49-year-old Parker, while sitting next to Malkemus in an interview with CNN's Maggie Lake. ""I was perfectly willing for him to say no, prepared for it in fact."" ""But I did not say no,"" adds Malkemus, who had never worked with a female designer before. ""I said 'come to my office tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.'"" Accessible accessories? The shoes will cost between $195 and $500 and be sold at U.S. retail giant Nordstrom --a place partly chosen for its accessibility to a wider range of women. ""I have always felt that there was this group of 10 million women that I was honor-bound to in some way,"" said Parker. ""I wouldn't be having this opportunity if it weren't for the dedication and diligence with which they committed to the TV show and my character who loved shoes.'"" ""Sure, it would be a thrill to make shoes that cost hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars. But the truth is those would not be accessible to those women who have given me this opportunity."" Creature comforts . Apart from the 'SJP' stamp of approval, how much influence did Parker actually have in the design? ""Sarah Jessica told me she was going to try on everything,"" said Malkemus. ""And she does try on everything -- she runs up and down the corridors to make sure that it'll be comfortable for the woman who's going to purchase that shoe."" Parker added: ""I would say to George: 'How comfortable is that going to be under the ball of my foot?' Because we have spent so many years of our lives, rightly or wrongly, running around in shoes, we know how it feels."" Other personal touches included different colored ribbons on each shoe -- relating to the ribbons Parker would wear in her hair as a little girl. ""This was something for my mother,"" she said of the striking strips of material. Fashion house . Born in Ohio, Parker was one of eight children -- including four from her mother's second marriage. ""We couldn't afford beautiful things, but my mother was very clever and industrious,"" she said. ""We would go to church Tag Sales in the wealthier neighborhoods."" ""I do remember sitting in what we called my mother's dressing room -- it was just a closet that separated me and my sister's bedroom that we shared, and my parents' room -- and we would watch her get dressed, and the last thing she would do was spray fragrance and it seemed like she was walking down this long boulevard to go down to the glamorous nightlife of Ohio."" The family later moved to New York, where Parker attended acting schools, landing the lead in the Broadway musical of ""Annie."" She made a name for herself on the big screen in ""Footloose,"" ""Hocus Pocus,"" ""The First Wives Club,"" among many others. Mum's the word . Parker married fellow actor Matthew Broderick in 1997 and the couple have three children. How does she juggle a successful career and family? ""I am in a position to choose to be busy,"" she said. ""There are millions of women in this country who have to work two or three jobs, who don't have the support system, who don't have the financial means to choose the kind of care they want for their children."" ""When I ride on the subway, every day I can see in someone's eyes that they're off to their second or third job in the day, and that they haven't seen their kids, and they're leaving their children someplace that they'd rather not. And so it seems ridiculous for me to wax on about how busy I am or how hard it is to balance these things in my life."" Learn: What Vivienne Westwood did next .

"(Tribune Media Services) -- Wearing a green T-shirt under a blue work shirt, I'm about to depart for Europe. At my farewell breakfast -- one last eggs-any-style -- my stylish, college-aged daughter says to me, ""You look like a scrub. OK if you're painting a house."" Slim down your suitcase by doing laundry in your room every few days. Scrub or not, my bag is light. As compartmentalized as a TV dinner, it includes a folding board with four shirts and an extra pair of pants; bags for small garments, such as underwear and five pairs of socks (wear for two days, wash every 10 days); a tiny toiletries kit; electronics (iPod, cell phone, camera, laptop, flash drive, chargers, adapters, and batteries); and that miscellaneous bag filled with security-blanket extras I probably won't need (spot remover, sewing kit, extra glasses, and so on). I also throw in a sweater, light jacket, and day bag. All my shoes are on my feet. That's it. Even when traveling in winter, I pack just about as light. I wear heavier, warmer, high-top, waterproof shoes. I add a warm coat, long johns (quick-drying Capilene or super-light silk), scarf, gloves, hat, and an extra pair of socks and underwear since things dry more slowly. I layer my clothing for warmth, knowing I'll be outside in the cold for hours at a time. Don't pack for the worst-case scenario. For a spring or fall trip, risk shivering for a day rather than taking a heavy coat (or buy a sweater in Europe for a useful, fun souvenir to layer under your jacket). Whatever time of year you go, minimize the amount of clothing you pack, choose dark clothes that dry quickly, and plan to spend 10 minutes every few nights doing some wash. I bring my luggage onboard, by limiting my load to 20 pounds in a carry-on-size bag (a soft 9-by-22-by-14-inch bag will fit in the overhead bins and under most airplane seats). With some airlines charging a fee to check even one suitcase, bringing just one carry-on bag can save you money and time. Quick, last-minute changes in flight plans become simpler. When I land in London, I'm on my way downtown while everyone else stares anxiously at the luggage carousel. When I fly home, I'm the first guy the dog sniffs. If you're traveling with only a carry-on, remember not to pack liquids (unless in bottles of 3 ounces or less). Check www.tsa.gov/travelers for the latest on what you can or can't bring on the plane. Packing light helps me be mobile in Europe. I use a convertible backpack/suitcase with zip-away shoulder straps, giving me the best of both worlds -- a suitcase when in town and a backpack when I'm on the move. I live out of this bag for three months each year -- and I absolutely love it. If you prefer to not have a bag on your back, consider a carry-on-sized suitcase with wheels (this is what my wife and daughter travel with). Base your decision on the strength of your back. Another advantage of packing light is that you're unlikely to leave something behind in a hotel. Packing up to check out of a room is a kind of ritual for me. Putting on my socks, I wonder if I really need to wear them again, considering my laundry level like checking a battery or a gas tank. I spread out the cover of my bed so nothing gets lost in a big wrinkle, then corral stuff scattered around the room onto the bed before tucking everything into my bag. For a one- or two-night stop, I don't use the closet or drawers, so they don't need to be checked. I carefully survey the electrical outlets to be sure I didn't forget some recharging cord. Most importantly, I physically feel my money belt to confirm that my passport -- the only item easy to feel without opening it -- is in there. A money belt is a small, nylon-zippered pouch that fastens around the waist under your pants or skirt. With a money belt, all of your can't-lose items (such as your passport, railpass, credit/debit card, and cash) are on you as securely and thoughtlessly as your underpants. Ever thought about that with underpants? You put them on in the morning, don't think about them all day long, and every night they're exactly where you put them. Wearing a money belt, all my essentials are just as securely out of sight and out of mind. It's luxurious peace of mind. Remember, packing light isn't just about the flight; it's about your traveling lifestyle. With only one bag, you'll feel lean and in control. After you enjoy that sweet mobility and freedom, you'll never go any other way.

"Shanghai (CNN) -- Baijiu can taste like a mix of cheap perfume and cleaning agents to the uninitiated palate. The clear alcohol, which is distilled from sorghum, glutinous rice or even wheat, is considered a national drink of China. It is also the world's most consumed spirit by volume. According to International Wine & Spirit Research, baijiu accounts for more than a third of all spirits consumed globally. But there remains little thirst for it outside of China. A crackdown on Chinese officials' lavish spending has affected domestic sales of baijiu, a customary drink at banquets and a common luxury gift. Baijiu producers concerned with the slump in sales are looking to expand the overseas market, but results remain to be seen. Meanwhile, a new English-language publication hopes to achieve the seemingly impossible: make non-Chinese fall in love with baijiu. Debunking myths . American author Derek Sandhaus would be the first one to agree that baijiu is an acquired taste. His book ""Baijiu: The Essential Guide to Chinese Spirits,"" released last month, began as a blog documenting Sandhaus' experiment to drink 300 shots of the stuff -- rumor has it, that is how much rookies need to drink before learning to enjoy the flavor. About 75 shots in, Sandhaus says he already started to appreciate the drink. He's now a ready evangelist for the spirit, hoping to debunk all baijiu myths. ""Right now the understanding of baijiu, and traditional Asian alcohols in general, is extremely low,"" Sandhaus says. ""The biggest misconception is that the word 'baijiu' signifies a single type of spirit. Baijiu is actually a byword for all grain-based spirits produced using traditional Chinese techniques. It's a broad category that includes more than a dozen distinct liquors."" Different baijius range in strength from over 60% alcohol by volume, to a far gentler 30%. They also have distinct flavor profiles, with classifications including ""light aroma,"" ""heavy aroma,"" and ""sauce aroma."" ""Rice aroma"" is the class of baijiu that many non-Chinese find most palatable. The misconception that Sandhaus says most threatens baijiu's success overseas, however, is that it is dangerous to the drinker's health. In fact, ""baijiu is no more unhealthy than your average rum or whiskey."" Attempts have been made to popularize baijiu in the United States. The Houston, Texas-based distillery Byejoe USA is importing a baijiu base that is then filtered and sold in the U.S. While in Portland, Oregon, baijiu is produced at Vinn Distillery in small amounts as an artisanal product. Sandhaus is excited about these developments: ""These efforts are relatively recent and which approach will be most successful remains to be seen."" ""I'm optimistic that baijiu will establish a foothold outside of China, but it won't happen overnight."" For dinner, not parties . In China, the baijiu industry faces its own challenges. In a bid to curtail lavish government spending, President Xi Jinping has reined in officials' budgets for banqueting, and has curbed a culture of gifting, popularly associated with corruption. The measures have seen profits of luxury status-symbol brands of baijiu fall sharply. Baijiu made $81 billion last year, according to the China Alcoholic Drinks Association. The growth rate is 15.6% lower than in 2012, with a 2% drop in profits. The setbacks have affected British liquor giant Diageo, which owns a controlling stake in the Quanxing holding company, the largest shareholder of Sichuanese baijiu brand Shui Jing Fang. Diageo CEO Ivan Meneze anticipates that the baijiu market will recover in 2015. Younger drinkers . Questions remain, however, over the longer term future of the spirit, which is less popular among young people, and faces growing competition from foreign spirits. Vance Yang, 39, is the owner of Yuan, a Shanghai bar celebrated for its Chinese perspective on Western cocktail making. The bar doesn't offer straight baijiu, but does use it in several mixed drinks, including a ""Dark and Smoggy,"" which contains 30ml of rum to only 5ml of the potent Chinese liquor. Yang says that alcohol consumption differs greatly by region, with baijiu popular in rural areas, the north, and the southwest of China. Regarding younger drinkers, he says, ""those from baijiu consuming regions will carry on drinking it. But to the Chinese, baijiu is still consumed during meal times. Once they go out to party at night, they will switch to imported spirits."" Yang himself tends to drink baijiu at dinner or with business partners, but mostly in second or third tier cities, not in Shanghai. Nevertheless, the bar owner is cautiously optimistic about a future for baijiu outside China. ""It is difficult because it has an acquired smell and taste, similar to stinky tofu. Either you like it or hate it.""","American author Derek Sandhaus reached the 300-shot threshold to learn to love baijiu .

"(CNN) -- Detroit was once known as the automobile capital of the world -- a global symbol of modernity and a testament to the power of American capitalism. After decades of industrial decay, however, the ""Motor City"" finally crashed when it filed for municipal bankruptcy in July 2013. Many long-time investors fled for safer havens beyond the city limits as property prices plummeted and businesses suffered. But not everyone took flight. Others settled in for the long haul, sure that the city that brought us the sounds of Motown and some of the most iconic cars ever built would bounce back. One such man was Fernando Palazuelo. The Peru-based developer stunned Detroiters by purchasing the abandoned Packard automotive plant earlier this year -- one of the most famous buildings to be sold after the city filed for bankruptcy and the most emblematic eyesore of Detroit's fall. But Palazeulo sees beauty and possibility amid the ruin of the Packard site. ""I think that the Packard Plant is in the best location ... surrounded by extraordinary highways, railways, airports, very close to Canada,"" Palazuelo said. A look at the numbers illustrates why international investors Like Palazuelo are entranced by Detroit's under-appreciated assets. Palazuelo bought the 325,000 square meter (3.5 million square feet) Packard space for just $405,000. To put these figures into context, San Francisco's average price per square meter of office space is about $6,000. With Detroit home to an estimated 78,000 abandoned buildings, it is little wonder then that international buyers spy an opportunity with big potential returns. A Chinese firm bought three properties downtown last year. In around 15 years, at a cost of approximately $350 million, Palazuelo envisions transforming the Packard site into a residential, commercial and industrial hub. ""Ten years (and) you will not recognize it,"" he said excitedly. ""You will think it was always in perfect shape. So we will do it."" Six years ago Palazuelo invested heavily in Lima's historical center, an area also blighted by vandalism and decades of deterioration. He bought property at rock-bottom prices then sat back and watched the value quickly rise. Detroit, and the world, will be watching closely watch to see if history repeats itself and if Palazuelo's financial prediction bears fruit. See also: Dutch architects build 3D printed house .

"Munich, Germany (CNN) -- The German diplomat who said there was an assassination attempt against Egypt's new vice president has retracted his comments. ""I was led to believe that we had a confirmed report but in fact we didn't,"" Wolfgang Ischinger told CNN, adding the information he received was based on an unsubstantiated source. Ischinger, the host of the Munich Security Conference, told a plenary session of the meeting that there was an assassination attempt against Omar Suleiman and several people were killed. At the time, he didn't provide any more detail about the incident. The vice president, appointed last week amid widespread cries for President Hosni Mubarak's ouster, has been working to initiate a government transition. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is attending the conference, said it's important to support the Suleiman-led transition process. Suleiman had been an intelligence chief and a powerful behind-the-scenes player for a long time, and his appointment was seen widely as an attempt by Mubarak to restore order. CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.","German diplomat said the report was based on an unsubstantiated source .

"(CNN) -- Humans have been doodling in snow, in sand and on cave walls for more than 30,000 years. George Washington, Thomas Edison, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Ronald Reagan and Vladimir Nabokov were doodlers. Bill Gates and Frank Gehry are among today's active doodlers. Yet most of us haven't reflected on why we feel compelled to draw. In fact, many parts of our society -- including businesses, schools and colleges -- frown on doodling and consider it a waste of time. While we can't overcome cultural biases overnight, we can certainly ask a relevant question: Why is doodling so universal? What is doodling doing for us? Virginia Scofield, an immunologist at the University of Texas at San Antonio, knows from personal and professional experience what doodling does. After struggling with organic chemistry in college, she decided to try doodling the complexities of the subject rather than memorizing them from the textbook. Scofield happened upon what native doodlers have known for a long time: Doodling can improve cognitive performance. Because of her success in transforming her own learning process, Scofield incorporated doodling and visual note-taking into her university classroom for more than two decades, and she told me it notably improved the success rate of her students. Scofield is not the only one who's learned to be impressed by the Doodle. Jackie Andrade, a professor at the University of Plymouth, published a study finding a 29 percent increase in information retention gained by doodlers. She noted that, contrary to popular belief, doodling seems to prevent people from losing focus on boring or complex subject matter. It gives learners who may otherwise mentally check out an opportunity to check back in. Other researchers exploring the impact of doodling and drawing have come to equally significant conclusions about this deceptively simple act. A recent article in Science argued that drawing in science education caters to individual learning preferences and motivates students to engage and explore content in a more meaningful way. And classroom research shows that not only do learners better understand concepts through simple drawing, but it sets the stage for innovative and divergent ways of thinking. For a nation with an ego wounded by our decreased scores on the Torrance Creativity Test, this unfettered access to creative thinking shouldn't be underestimated. Just ask Google, the only company on record with an official Chief Doodler on the payroll. Google's culture is well known for its 80/20 ""innovation time off"" rule. And for many employees, that time is spent using simple visual language to doodle, sketch and prototype new business opportunities. Indeed, many companies seeking an edge are looking to applications of hand-drawn visual language as a prospective lifeboat. In a hyper-competitive marketplace, thinkers need all the mojo they can muster. To the throngs of doodlers around the world, this evidence is likely just the beginning of our gentle ""I told you so"" moments. Learning that accommodates more than text-based or verbal information amplifies the effects of cognition and creativity. And when the Science article suggested that drawing should be recognized along with reading, writing and speaking as a key element in education, it was a hallelujah moment for doodlers around the world. I'm one of them. I use doodling for a variety of reasons: I use it to get clarity around a concept, I use it to relax, I use it to communicate ideas with others and get their refinement of them, I use it to map complex systems for companies, I use it to run innovation games for business, I use it to get insight on something puzzling me. See some examples of how doodles are used . So how do you get better at doodling? It's a delightfully easy task. Learners can start with the Visual Alphabet, a series of six flowsâ€”the point, line, arc, angle, spiral and loop, and the six formsâ€”the oval, eye, triangle, rectangle, house and cloud. With these 12 ""letters,"" prospective doodlers can articulate any visual representation of any concept they can imagine. All it takes is a commitment to learning this language, native to our brain's visual cortex, and applying it to challenges either at work or at school. Rather than talking in circles about a complex subject, try doodling it using words and pictures. Show your teachers and colleagues another way to see information. The insights and aha moments will arrive naturally in the process. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sunni Brown.","Sunni Brown: Doodles are an ancient human art form .

"(CNN) -- The Muslim month of fasting, Ramadan, ended this week, marked across the Islamic world by the feasts of Eid el Fitr. Traditionally a time spent with family at home, Ramadan has also become a time for reflection for many Syrians displaced by conflict in the country. According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNCHR), the refugee camp at Za'atari in Jordan is home to around 145,000 Syrians who have fled the ongoing violence. Life there is difficult for its residents, and other Syrians who have found themselves living far from home across the region, from Beirut in Lebanon to Egypt's capital Cairo. Photographers from the UNCHR captured the period on camera and discovered that, supported by their memories and dreams, those living in Za'atari could work through the struggles of life as a refugee and still observe the holy period.","Syrians in Za'atari refugee camp in Jordan marked Ramadan in different ways .

"New York (CNN) -- Thursday's opening of the National September 11 Memorial Museum in New York was 13 years in the making. Museum officials consulted hundreds of people -- survivors, relatives of the victims, rescue workers, community leaders and others -- as they determined what should be included in the exhibits occupying the halls beneath the footprints of the Twin Towers. While that effort has been applauded by many for being a fitting, emotional telling of one of the darkest days in U.S. history, it is not without its controversies. Among them is a seven-minute film entitled ""The Rise of Al Qaeda."" The documentary tells the story of the growth of a worldwide terrorist organization. The film, which features video of al Qaeda training camps and previous attacks, plays next to a room where photos of the 9/11 attackers are on display. The inclusion of that story is not the problem. But the use of words like ""jihad"" and ""Islamist"" in the narration prompted some Muslim Americans and others to call for edits. ""We feel that there is unfortunate messaging in referencing to Islam,"" said Zead Ramadan of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. His wife was a first responder who aided in the search-and-rescue effort after the attacks. Ramadan fears that millions of visitors will walk away from the documentary believing that Islam is to blame for 9/11. The Rev. Chloe Breyer, executive director of the Interfaith Center of New York, was part of a museum advisory council that was given an opportunity to view the documentary. ""The film loosely and without sufficient definition or context describes the rise of al Qaeda and uses terms that are confusing and controversial,"" she said. Breyer said the the film is the only museum display that appears to assign blame. ""It's the one thing in there that suggests who to blame,"" she said. ""And to do that, it requires the kind of depth and nuance and sophistication that the rest of the museum has. It's a very delicate and difficult complex question, and they don't go anywhere near addressing it."" She said interfaith leaders unsuccessfully recommended a ""contextual statement at the very beginning that says this video is about the historical rise of al Qaeda and does not relate to the history of Islam."" Ramadan and Breyer belong to a group of interfaith leaders who claim the museum's leadership has turned a deaf ear to their concerns. Museum officials disagree. ""No one will come through this exhibit and, in any way, think that we are indicting an entire religion, which we in no way are,"" said Joe Daniels, president of the National September 11 Memorial Museum. In a statement, museum officials said: ""A major part of preserving the history of September 11 is to show who was responsible for the monstrous attack on America that led to the deaths of thousands of innocent people of various ethnicities and religious beliefs. This brief film, within the context of surrounding exhibits, focuses on the roots of al Qaeda with the express purpose of helping visitors understand who perpetrated the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It does not purport to be a film about Islam or in any way generalize that Muslims are terrorists."" National security expert Haroon Moghul, a fellow at the New America Foundation, a think tank, said the film needs a more nuanced approach to telling the story of the terrorists. ""They acted in the name of their religion. I don't dispute that,"" said Moghul. ""I want that when an American or anyone else goes through the museum, that when they watch the movie, they leave more informed."" 9/11 museum: Tragedy turns the mundane into memorial .","National September 11 Memorial Museum in New York opens Thursday .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Taliban insurgents attacked Afghanistan's election commission headquarters in Kabul on Saturday, staff and a government official said, a week before the April 5 presidential election. Afghan security forces battled the militants for about five hours. Gen. Mohammad Ayoub Salangi, the deputy interior minister, said all five attackers were killed and two people were injured. According to Salangi, the five insurgents wore women's burqas when they entered a building close to the Independent Election Commission compound at around 12:30 p.m. local time. He said they used small guns and rocket-propelled grenades. Earlier, a commission employee had told CNN that two explosions had erupted outside the commission's compound. Following the blasts, militants took up combat positions outside the compound and engaged in a firefight with Afghan security forces, Mohammad Dawran said. In a statement, a Taliban spokesman claimed responsibility for the attack. Spate of assaults . A commission source told CNN rocket-propelled grenades hit two warehouses inside the commission compound. The source, who declined to be named, said both warehouses had caught fire when they were hit. Saturday's attack, which forced the closure of Kabul's airport for hours, follows a spate of recent assaults in the capital in the run-up to national elections in April 5. The Taliban have vowed to disrupt the elections to replace outgoing President Hamid Karzai and to punish anyone involved in them. On Friday, five militants set off a car bomb at a guesthouse used by foreigners and then held people as hostages until police killed one of the militants, and the other four blew themselves up. A girl was killed in the attack. On Tuesday, militants stormed an election commission office in Kabul, leading to a five-hour gunbattle with Afghan security services.

"(CNN) -- Australian teenager Nick Kyrgios lit up Wimbledon with his stunning victory over Rafael Nadal and his prodigious talents were on display again Tuesday in his first appearance at a Masters 1000 tournament. The 19-year-old's charge to the quarterfinals at the grass court grand slam saw him leap to number 70 in the world and led to a wild card entry to the Rogers Cup in Toronto, one of the prestigious series of ATP events below grand slams. His first round opponent was the experienced Colombian Santiago Giraldo, who is currently at a career-high 30 and a tight match ensued. Kyrgios had to recover from a break down in the opener to force a tiebreak, which he won by seven points to three. The second set was also tight until Kyrgios gained a crucial break through on Giraldo's service to run out a 7-6 7-5 winner in one hour 35 minutes. He will next face a big test in the form of eighth seed and two-time grand slam winner Andy Murray, who is also playing his first tournament since his disappointing exit at Wimbledon in his title defense. Kyrgios eventually lost in the last eight at Wimbledon to Milos Raonic of Canada and the sixth seed and home favorite has learned his second round opponent. American Jack Sock, 21, beat Austria's Jurgen Melzer 6-1 6-3 to earn his chance against Raonic after his second win at ATP Masters 1000 level. The tournament also sees the return to action of Wimbledon champion and world number one Novak Djokovic and beaten finalist Roger Federer. Nadal is sidelined with a wrist injury which is hampering his preparations for the final grand slam of the season at the U.S. Open. The women's version of the Rogers Cup is being played in Montreal and Venus Williams snapped a surprising 19-year-old win drought on Canadian soil with a first round victory. The veteran American is playing for the fifth time in the tournament and had suffered early exits on all four previous occasions. Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova looked set to extend that sorry run when she leveled at a set apiece, but Williams dominated the decider to win 6-1 3-6 6-2. Her sister Serena, fresh from her success in Stanford at the weekend, is the top seed and defending champion at the tournament, which alternates between Toronto and Montreal.","Nick Kyrgios wins his first Masters 1000 match .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A man accused of playing a role in the 1968 hijacking of a Pan Am flight from New York to Puerto Rico was captured Sunday, federal officials said. Luis Armando Pena Soltren surrendered to federal authorities at New York's JFK International Airport. Luis Armando Pena Soltren, 66, surrendered to federal authorities at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport after exiting a flight from Havana, Cuba, officials said. It's the same airport from which Pan Am Flight 281 took off more than 40 years ago. Additional details on Soltren's apprehension were not provided by authorities. Soltren ""will finally face the American justice system that he has been evading for more than four decades,"" said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. According to a December 1968 indictment, Soltren and three others -- Jose Rafael Rios Cruz, Miguel Castro and Alejandro Figueroa -- conspired to hijack Flight 281 on November 24 of that year. The suspects were accused of bringing concealed guns and knives aboard the flight and using the weapons to take over the flight. Members of the crew told authorities at the time that the suspects, wielding pistols and large knives, forced their way into the cabin of the plane and ordered the crew to fly to Havana, according to court documents. Cruz and Castro were sentenced in the 1970s after pleading guilty in U.S. District Court in New York. They received 15-year and 12-year sentences, respectively. Their current whereabouts were not immediately known. Figueroa was acquitted in 1969 after a bench trial.

"(CNN) -- The late-fall chill outside a Best Buy store in Elkridge, Maryland, wasn't all that was keeping George Nelums awake late Thursday. ""I've been a PS dude since the first PS,"" said Nelums, the first in line to pick up a PlayStation 4 when the clock struck midnight. ""I'm not planning on sleeping tonight. I've got a 6-hour energy drink. I'm all set."" He and about 100 others were there for the next step in the evolution of home entertainment. The new PlayStation hit stores a week before Microsoft's Xbox One does the same, touching off a new round in the fight for the hearts of console gamers. Compare: PlayStation 4 vs. Xbox One . It was a scene that played out at thousands of stores across North America. In New York, Sony rented out the entire Standard High Line Hotel in Manhattan, where roughly 500 people showed up to watch a light show of video-game scenes as they waited for the midnight launch. Matt and Tammy Nyers, of Laurel, Maryland, picked up their two new pre-ordered consoles at the Elkridge store -- one to keep and one they plan on selling on eBay. Matt said he's more of a sports gamer and really wants to see what next year's ""Madden"" will be like when it is designed specifically for the new console. ""It is the latest and greatest and I want to see what they can do,"" he said. ""I'm really wanting to see what games will be coming out next because they will be built just for the PS4. This is built more like a gaming rig (than the PS3)."" The first new home console for Sony in more than seven years, the PlayStation 4 incorporates many new features over its predecessor, the PlayStation 3. Greater focus on social interaction during gameplay, a redesigned controller with a touchpad interface, and expansion of streaming entertainment choices are just a few of the new elements for PS4. Andrew House, president and group CEO of Sony Entertainment, said building this next-generation console took nearly seven years and that Sony had specific goals in mind to reach today's launch date. ""Having a shared experience on the same sofa in front of the same screen is something that I, as a parent, want to have with my family,"" House told CNN during the PS4 launch event in New York City this week. ""A device that is designed from the ground up to be able to serve up all those different kinds of experiences, but with a great user interface that's designed to work specifically in the living room, I think is still very, very important."" With more than a million pre-orders reported by Sony in August, it would seem the public was ready to get their hands on the latest next-generation console (Nintendo's Wii U was released last year). Analysts expect the demand for the system to outstrip supply through Christmas. ""People were coming in early this week just to get games that were released and extra controllers,"" Brooks Holman, home sales manager at the Maryland Best Buy said. ""They were making extra trips to the store just to make sure they had everything they wanted for when they got their new PS4."" Devin Gergen, Minnesota native, is one of many military personnel stationed in the area who spent hours outside the store. He hadn't pre-ordered, but remained hopeful . ""I just like the experience of standing in line, meeting new people, sharing gamer tags,"" Gergen said. ""You get to chat around with all kinds of people. It is fun."" The lines were predominately guys in their 20s and 30s, and some in line were hoping to score the perfect gift. Delaney Lockhart, a 21-year-old college student attending Towson University, waited with her mother in the chilled night air. But Lockhart said she wasn't getting the PS4 for herself. ""I'm getting the game for my brother for Christmas,"" she said, laughing. ""I'm a good sister. He owes me."" The excitement, though, didn't mean everything has gone perfectly for Sony's rollout. Shuhei Yoshida, president of Sony's Worldwide Studios, tweeted that the company is investigating reports of broken consoles, but said the problem isn't widespread. ""Be assured we are investigating reported PS4 issues,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""The number is very small compared to shipped, we believe they are isolated incidents.""

"(CNN) -- Parts of the Florida Panhandle and coastal Alabama were under water Sunday, with an onslaught of torrential rains causing not just extensive flooding but also damage to roads and buildings, local officials said. More than 20 inches of rain have fallen over the past 24 hours in spots in Escambia County, the county's emergency management director John Dosh told CNN around noon Sunday. The National Weather Service, in fact, noted a wide range of rainfall totals around the region through 8 a.m. Sunday. Though some coastal spots such as Destin, Florida, received around an inch, others had much more -- including between five and 10 inches in parts of Mobile, Alabama, and 21.7 inches in West Pensacola, Florida. The precipitation contributed to a host of problems, with flooding especially substantial in the southern part of Escambia County along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, according to Dosh. Some 113 people are in shelters in Escambia County due to the storm, and residents of a low-lying apartment complex were ordered to evacuate, the spokesman added. But there have been no related fatalities or injuries. Additionally, several roads and bridges, as well as a number of homes and businesses, have suffered damage, said Dosh. One of the structures affected is the Escambia County Jail in Pensacola. The facility's central booking facility, where inmates are brought in, was under about six feet of water at midday Saturday, according to Escambia County Sheriff's Office spokesman Mike Ward. The main part of the jail, which houses 697 inmates, lost power in the storm, said Ward. But temporary power has been brought in, and efforts continue to get the air conditioning back working. The spokesman said security at the jail was never compromised. Flash flooding made parts of some roadways impassable, with some reporting waters rising more than six feet in spots. Leroy Bonifay, 90, told CNN affiliate WALA that he and his grandson got stuck along Airport Boulevard in Pensacola when water ""washed up over my hood and drowned my engine."" It climbed even higher, up to the windows, before two bystanders came to their rescue. ""I have never seen it get this high in this area before,"" said Bonifay. ""It's tough, but we'll make it out all right."" And the headaches aren't over, as the rain may not let up anytime soon. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch through Monday morning for parts of southwest Alabama, northwest Florida and southeast Mississippi, where three to six more inches of rain are expected. There is also ""a high risk for rip currents"" through 1 p.m. Monday off Alabama and Florida Panhandle beaches, according to the weather agency.","NEW: The weather service warns of a ""high risk of rip tide currents"" through Monday .

"(CNN) -- For cybersecurity reasons, sailors on U.S. Navy vessels can't always use smartphones and tablets. And in the cramped quarters of a submarine, there's little room for shelves full of books. So how is a bookworm sailor supposed to pass the time during those long hours at sea? The Navy has a solution: The Navy eReader Device, or ""NeRD"" for short, a custom-made, secure e-reader that comes preloaded with a library of 300 titles. The device has no cellular connectivity or Wi-Fi, so there are no signals to betray its location or tempt enemy hackers. Yes, that NeRD name may stigmatize reading for some seamen and women. But the Navy is hoping the new gadget will be a welcome companion for bored sailors. ""I know the paperbacks (on Navy ships) get passed back and forth until they fall apart,"" said Nilya Carrato, program assistant for the Navy General Library Program. ""We're hoping the NeRD holds up a little better."" The Navy will start by distributing five devices to each of the submarines in its active fleet, Carrato told CNN. Eventually, it plans to send NeRDs to all Navy vessels. ""I've gotten some e-mails from sailors on surface vessels who are very eager to know when they'll get them,"" Carrato said. Each NeRD will offer a mix of fiction, nonfiction, best-sellers, classics and historical books selected by the Navy. Popular titles will include the ""Game of Thrones"" series, ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,"" ""Ender's Game,"" ""The Lord of the Rings,"" Stephen King's ""The Stand"" and ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks."" More literary-minded sailors will be able to read digital versions of classics by Shakespeare, Jane Austen, James Joyce, Walt Whitman and even Samuel Taylor Coleridge, whose ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" would make a fitting read. Contrary to some news reports, Carrato said the devices won't contain any Tom Clancy novels, however. So if sailors want their ""Hunt for Red October"" fix, they'll have to watch the movie adaptation on DVD. The e-readers were developed for the Navy through a partnership with Findaway World, which provides digital devices and audiobook technology to the Pentagon.

"(CNN) -- Amid a grove of trees, buried beneath the grass and dirt, Mississippi's past is colliding with its future. Surveyors last month discovered dozens of neat, tight rows of coffins just feet below the ground at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. Sure, there were stories that there was a cemetery somewhere on the grounds of the medical center that today sits where the Mississippi State Lunatic Asylum once stood. But the location of the cemetery was lost to history. That's until an estimated 2,000 unmarked graves were discovered during a survey for a planned campus expansion. The find has forced the medical center to halt its expansion and begin the daunting task of figuring out what to do about the 2,000 bodies lying in the path of their next big thing. It's a scene that has played out in recent years in New York, California, Texas, Illinois and Wisconsin as developers look to build on what is believed to be vacant land only to find forgotten graveyards. ""As development continues likely more are to be found,"" Erin Kimmerle, a forensic anthropology professor at the University of Florida, said. But the sheer size of the Mississippi find -- one of the largest in recent years -- has many asking one question: Who were these people? Finding coffins . For as long as anyone can remember, construction workers and contractors have been finding the simple pine boxes on the property of the medical center, which opened in 1955. There were four, five and sometimes six boxes with only skeletal remains found here and there on the grounds. Once, in the 1990s, workers building a laundry facility found about 40 unmarked graves, said Jack Mazurak, a spokesman for the medical center. But last year, that number jumped with the discovery of 66 coffins during a road improvement project at the campus. Over the years, there were rumors. Depending on who you asked, the coffins contained the bodies of the Civil War dead or slaves. But experts disagreed. Historical records revealed the area was not a major battlefield during the war, and there was no indication in the state historical archives that a slave cemetery existed on the site. The medical center partnered with the Mississippi State University anthropology department, with a team led by Prof. Nicholas Hermann, that was tasked with removing the remains for testing. Almost immediately, Hermann's team determined the bodies were connected to the asylum, which opened on the grounds in 1855. ""We're guessing because there's no personal remains, no clothes, not even really any buttons or pins or anything, that they were probably residents of the asylum and either buried in a shroud or not buried with anything, so that would put them probably around in the mid to late 1800s to early 1900s,"" Derek Anderson, an archeologist on the team, told CNN affiliate WLBT shortly after the finds. Once testing is finished, the bodies will be reinterred in the medical center's designated cemetery, Hermann said. Florida to exhume bodies buried at former boys school . 'A lot of graves' A number of factors, from historical records to the layout of the coffins, led Hermann to believe this was just the beginning of the find. When he found out the medical center was planning on building a cancer center and a children's justice center on the site, he said: ""I think you are going to have a lot of graves."" Part of his assessment hinged on history. The asylum drew residents from across the state, people who were committed for a variety of ailments. Many, according to records, were institutionalized for years. When residents died, few were claimed by families. Experts believe poverty may have also played a role -- families could not afford to retrieve and transport the bodies. As a result, many were buried in unmarked graves in an area of the property believed designated as the asylum cemetery. Without headstones and markings to denote the outlines of the cemetery, it was swallowed up by time. So how do you determine that without digging up the grounds and, possibly, disturbing the dead? The answer: ground-penetrating radar. ""When I saw the printout of that ...property, it was mind-blowing,"" Mazurak said. The radar survey showed hundreds and hundreds of coffin-like outlines in tight rows. Many were believed to be just four or five feet below the surface. ""As it turned out there were 800 to 1,000 graves on the southern piece of property, and another 1,000 graves on the north side of the property,"" Mazurak said. 'Living link' Almost immediately, construction plans on the site were put on hold. Already the university medical center was absorbing the cost to exhume and rebury the bodies found last year at a cost of about $3,000 each, Mazurak said. Removing 66 coffins from underneath a road was one thing. But removing hundreds of coffins from an unmarked graveyard was another thing entirely. ""There is a living link to each grave,"" Mazurak said. Exhuming and reinterring upwards of 2,000 bodies would cost millions, a price the university can't afford. So for now, the medical center will leave the dead where they lie and look for alternatives for the expansion. As news of the find made headlines, people across the country reached out to the medical center. The questions, in many cases, were the same: Can you tell me if my family member is buried there? Unmarked graves bring their plight to light . Searching for answers . That's the question Jannie White posed when she stumbled upon the news of the unmarked graveyard at the medical center. White has spent years researching her family history, trying to piece together the path her family had taken from Mississippi north. She grew up hearing stories about a great-grandmother who had been institutionalized at the asylum. The details were sketchy, and nobody was sure where the woman was buried or even what name she was buried under. ""I guess you would call it a rumor in the family. They kept saying she was in an institution a little bit outside of Jackson,"" White said in a telephone call from her Detroit-area home. She picked up the telephone and started making phone calls, eventually connecting with Mazurak and others at the medical center. ""I asked whether they could tell me if she was buried there, and what name she was buried under,"" she said. ""I'm just trying to find out what our last name was then."" But answers have been harder to come by. Records related to the asylum are contained in 16 bound volumes at the Mississippi state archive, Hermann said. The volumes, all handwritten, are rich with detail, chronicling the name, age, ailment and admission date for every patient from between 1855 and 1935, when the asylum was closed and relocated. ""Within those records, they provided a detailed account of how many people died every year and what they died of,"" Hermann said. Hermann's team believes their research on the 66 skeletal remains may one day be able to determine who was buried where on the property, if not the exact location. ""People are very concerned about their relatives, and that's a driving factor,"" he said. Studying the past . It's a years-long project that requires digitizing the records as well as testing DNA, primarily from teeth of the remains. Those results, Hermann says, will reveal details about where the person grew up regionally. With that information combined with the records, Hermann and others believe it's possible to link the dead with the living. Already, Hermann and his team have determined the 66 bodies uncovered during the road improvement project were buried late in the asylum's history, somewhere around the 1920s. By knowing where the dead came from and what they died of, it will help shed light on the history and treatment of mental health conditions across the state of Mississippi in the late 1800s and early 1900s, Hermann said. With a limited budget and less than a dozen people on the research team, the answers to many questions are likely years away. But one thing, Mazurak says, is clear about the find in Mississippi: ""The past frequently intersects, I almost want to say collides, with the present.""","About 2,000 unmarked graves were found at the University of Mississippi medical center .

"(CNN) -- Two White House-bound turkeys can thank good looks and personality for saving their lives. The 45-pound birds endured months of rigorous training and rose to the head of a class of 20,000 feathered friends vying for a pardon from the dreaded Thanksgiving Day buffet. President Obama on Wednesday continued a tradition of sparing turkeys from the chopping block, as each of his predecessors since George H.W. Bush has done. The National Turkey Federation has presented a bird to the president for more than 60 years, but the early honorees often became dinner. ""It feels pretty good to stop at least one shellacking this November,"" the president joked. Apple is the official National Thanksgiving Turkey and Cider is the alternate.  The NTF brings two birds each year in case a backup is needed. Both get pardoned, but only one gets to be the official turkey. The names were chosen from hundreds of submissions from students who participated in California Foundation for Agriculture in the Classroom, a program where they learned about how the turkey was raised. This year's winners are Nicholas Strain turkeys, a breed that originated in California's Sonoma Valley. While the birds are a bit larger than a typical tom, they've been living off a typical diet of corn and soy beans. The annual turkey (and his alternate) will now be living a life of luxury, but moving to the front of the flock was hard work. Twenty-five birds from a hatch of 20,000 born the week of July 10 were relocated to a small ranch outside of Modesto, California, said Yubert Envia, vice president of turkey and prepared foods for Foster Farms and this year's chairman of the NTF. Since six weeks of age, those birds have been in training, getting used to being handled and in the spotlight. They listened to music, ranging from country to rock, to get acclimated to a variety of sounds. The turkeys toured eight schools along the West Coast before the pack was narrowed further. Then, last Friday, the remaining birds competed in a high-stakes beauty contest. ""We had the birds walk around to make sure they had a good strut on them and they were walking well. We were looking for nice white plumage on them, good feathering and a nice fanning tail,"" Envia said. The finalists were selected and separated for a final round of handling and two standouts were dubbed the winners. The turkeys had two days to prepare before boarding a plane for the East Coast. (And yes, they did get their own version of a pat down). ""The birds made it great. No broken feathers or anything like that. That was a great trip for them,"" Envia said. Before the White House ceremony, the birds spent time getting used to the nation's capital and relaxing at the W Hotel. After the official pardon, the birds will travel to Mount Vernon, where they will live out the rest of their lives. ""It was George Washington that declared a day of thanks ... so what better place to retire than the home of the first president of the United States?"" Envia said. ""We're pretty excited about Mount Vernon, and I think the birds are really going to enjoy themselves over there.""","President Obama pardoned official Thanksgiving turkey .

"(CNN) -- Today is my chemo anniversary. A year ago today, I started chemotherapy. Is that something you celebrate? Is it something you even acknowledge? I've had mixed feelings about marking an anniversary that changed my life. Before I was diagnosed, I was in my prime. I was 34 years old and undoubtedly in the best shape of my adult life. I had met the girl of my dreams, I was being promoted at work, and I was training for an Olympic triathlon. Living a healthy lifestyle isn't something that comes easily. It's a choice you make -- a choice I made some years ago. Growing up, I was an athlete, and sports were a big part of my life. Then, in my 20s, after moving to New York and making some unhealthy choices, I once again took control of my life and put my health first. That dying patient could have been me . Being healthy defined me. Whether it was what I ate or how many times a week I exercised, it was a priority. It was time I dedicated to me, time that was spent bettering myself, both physically and mentally. And almost overnight, it was taken from me. I had cancer. Being diagnosed was a big shock, not only for me but for those around me. If it could happen to me, someone who took their health so seriously, it could happen to anyone. While training for the triathlon, I was plagued with a lot of injuries that no one could really figure out. It wasn't until I requested a CT scan on the advice of a friend that anything was detected. When the results from the scan came back, my doctor said it could be lymphoma or some type of infection. I prayed for the latter, but at that moment, I knew it was much more serious. Diabetes took my teeth but not my life . As an athlete, you know your body well, and something just didn't feel right. I had dealt with injuries before, but not like this. I met with a stomach specialist who told me it was most likely lymphoma, and the next step was a biopsy. I met with my oncologist, but it wasn't until we got the biopsy results that I was finally diagnosed. I did not have lymphoma but testicular cancer, and it was spreading fast. I remember thinking cancer wouldn't affect me too much, that I'd just have to stop every month for a week for what I called ""a little chemo."" I was wrong. Nothing I read and nothing I was told could have prepared me for what was to come. Chemo is essentially poison that kills the all the bad things in your body; the good things are collateral damage. Why I gave up soda . I wasn't prepared to feel winded after climbing a set of stairs when running 5 miles had been nothing for me. I wasn't ready for how my hair would one day just fall from my head as if it wasn't mine. I wasn't ready for the debilitating nausea that could render me helpless. Everything I had worked so hard for was slowly slipping away. I was being attacked from the inside, and I couldn't control it. What I was first told would be a three- to four-month ordeal turned into a year. Four rounds of chemo and two abdominal surgeries later, I'm in the clear and couldn't be happier. Ultimately, what it all came down to was that the healthy lifestyle I had chosen aided my recovery. My strength allowed me to recover faster. Just six months after my first surgery, I'm training for a triathlon. So now, I start from the beginning. I'm ready to live again. I'm ready to be healthy again. My second surgery is only eight weeks behind me, and my workouts have begun. They're light, but I'm moving in the right direction. This will be no easy feat, but I know I'll get there. I can't let cancer win. If I don't get back to the best shape of my life, I've let cancer off the hook. I intend to take back from it, what it took from me. I intend to cross that finish line in September. Celebrating small victories .","Jamil Nathoo was diagnosed with testicular cancer while training for an Olympic triathlon .

"(CNN) -- In March 2010 I found out my twin sister, Bobbette, needed a kidney transplant. With a body mass index of well over 50, I was ruled out as a donor. At that moment, I decided I would get healthy once she got healthy. I decided that my weight would never again keep me from doing something I wanted. Bobbette got a new kidney in June and was finally getting back on her feet in September. Then it was my turn. I weighed 385 pounds -- and no, it wasn't because I like to eat. I grew up as a fat kid, and food was my coping mechanism. In September 2011, I started walking. By the end of the year, I started making better food choices. In January 2012, I joined my local Y, where I started taking water classes such as HÂ²O cardio and hydrorider. In June 2012 I was down to 330 pounds. One of my best friends, Anje, volunteered to help me lose even more weight. She figured out quickly that I loved sports; more than anything I wanted to be an athlete. She came up with a plan for us to approach my weight loss in phases. At the end of each phase, I would do some athletic feat. At the end of phase one, I would run a 5K without stopping. Phase two was a half marathon. She suggested a triathlon for phase three; I laughed in her face and told her she was crazy. Fate had another plan. One morning I heard Jeff Dauler on ""The Bert Show"" recount the biggest lesson he had learned from being part of the CNN Fit Nation 2012 team. That lesson was ""In times of transition, keep moving forward. It doesn't matter how you do it, as long as you keep going forward."" That year was a time of transition for me and to ""keep moving forward,"" I knew I had to be part of the 2013 CNN Fit Nation team. On Christmas Day 2012, I got the best present ever: a Facebook message from a producer saying CNN had to talk to me. I knew this was going to be big. ""Surprise, welcome and congratulations. ..."" I heard those words from Dr. Sanjay Gupta and immediately screamed and started to cry. I finally had a team, and I was going to be a triathlete in nine months. The biggest obstacle for me was cycling. I had never clipped into a bike, and I was terrified by the thought of it. By the time we got to our midway training trip in Clermont, Florida, I was doing better but still hated it. With two words, my trainer April Burkey made me a cyclist on that trip -- and started to heal some emotional scars. We were coming off a huge hill, and she said, ""Let go. ..."" At that point she was talking about the brakes, but we had been talking all day about my self-perception. Like braking on a bike, I was holding on too tightly to people, words and situations that had hurt me and to worries about things over which I have absolutely no control. 5 lessons we learned while training for our first triathlon . When it came time for the Nautica Malibu Triathlon, I had no fear. I knew without a doubt I would finish. I was so excited and thankful for this opportunity to live out a childhood dream of being on a team. I had lost nearly 200 pounds and was healthier and happier than ever. As I was out on the course, I would see my teammates, and every time we would yell words of encouragement to each other. It didn't matter who finished first as long as we finished. I had a sense of finally belonging. I never felt more free and confident in my life as I did when I threw my hands in the air as I crossed the finish line. I left all the words and actions that hurt and haunted me since childhood along with the unhealthy, unhappy woman I used to be at the finish line in Malibu on September 8, 2013. I had finally ""let go."" Now the only thing left to do is keep moving forward.

"(CNN) -- When Apple co-founder Steve Jobs succumbed to cancer in his California home a year ago today, the world rushed to eulogize him in glowing terms: Genius. Visionary. A modern-day Thomas Edison. Obituaries and video clips focused on how he led a mobile-computing revolution, upended the music industry with iTunes and, at Pixar, changed the way movies are made. Pundits marveled at his brilliance in creating a mystique about Apple products and knowing which unborn electronic gadgets consumers would most desire. Fans lit candles outside Apple stores around the world, and more than a million people left thanks or tributes to Jobs on Apple's website. 10 things Steve Jobs taught us . But in the 12 months since, as high-profile books have probed Jobs' life and career, that reputation has evolved somewhat. Nobody has questioned Jobs' seismic impact on computing and our communication culture. But as writers have documented Jobs' often callous, controlling personality, a fuller portrait of the mercurial Apple CEO has emerged. ""Everyone knows that Steve had his 'rough' side. That's partially because he really did have a rough side and partially because the rough Steve was a better news story than the human Steve,"" said Ken Segall, author of ""Insanely Simple: The Obsession That Drives Apple's Success."" ""Since Apple is the most-watched company on Earth, there are a ton of writers always looking for the new angle,"" Segall added. ""After all the glowing tributes to Steve ran their course, it's not surprising that the more negative articles would start to pop up."" 10 great quotes from Steve Jobs . The book . Nineteen days after Jobs' death, Walter Isaacson's much-awaited biography of the Apple leader hit stores and immediately became the top-selling book in the country. In ""Steve Jobs,"" Isaacson crafted a compelling narrative of how Jobs' co-founded Apple with Steve Wozniak, got pushed out of the struggling company a decade later and then returned in the late 1990s to begin one of the most triumphant second acts in the annals of American business. But he also spent many pages chronicling the arrogant, cruel behavior of a complicated figure who could inspire people one minute and demean them the next. According to the book, Jobs would often berate employees whose work he didn't like. He was notoriously difficult to please and viewed people and products in black and white terms. They were either brilliant or ""sh-t."" As a young man Jobs abandoned his pregnant girlfriend and was later a cold, distant father to his daughter, Lisa. And in one especially callous episode, Jobs refused to give founding stock options to one of Apple's earliest employees, even after a fellow employee intervened and offered to match whatever Jobs was willing to spare. ""What Isaacson's book did was puncture a hole in the image the rest of the world had of Steve Jobs,"" said Adam Lashinsky, a senior editor at Fortune and author of ""Inside Apple: How America's Most Admired -- and Secretive -- Company Really Works."" Thanks to Isaacson, ""the population at large has gotten a much fuller picture of who he really was,"" Lashinsky added. ""I don't think that really changes anyone's opinion of his accomplishments. It just may change their opinion of him."" The Isaacson book, and other accounts of Jobs' life and work, have reinforced parallel images of the late executive as an ingenious innovator but a demanding, unpleasant person. ""His stature is greater than ever. No one denies his brilliance and his legacy,"" said Leander Kahney, editor and publisher of Cult of Mac and author of ""Inside Steve's Brain,"" a book about Jobs. ""However, his personality, his methods, have been thrown into a harsh new light by Isaacson's biography,"" Kahney told CNN. ""Everyone knew he was a taskmaster, but his cruelty -- his relentless, humorless pursuit of corporate perfection -- wasn't so widely acknowledged. It's certainly put some people off. Some see his life as a warning. It's a lesson in how not to devote your life to your work."" This dichotomy was reinforced in July when Wired magazine published a cover story, ""Do you really want to be like Steve Jobs?"" and a cover image of Jobs wearing both a halo and devil horns. The article argued that Jobs' example has created two camps of people: those who want to emulate his ruthless, idiosyncratic business style, and those who are turned off by his failings as a father and a human. ""Indeed, his life story has emerged as an odd sort of holy scripture for entrepreneurs, a gospel and an anti-gospel at the same time,"" said the article, by Ben Austen. ""To some, Jobs' life has revealed the importance of sticking firmly to one's vision and goals, no matter the psychic toll on employees or business associates. To others, Jobs serves as a cautionary tale, a man who changed the world but at the price of alienating almost everyone around him."" Did Apple's fanboy fever peak with Steve Jobs? Apple since Steve . Some observers say that Apple's mighty financial performance over the past year, its stock price is almost $300 higher now than it was when Jobs died and Apple is now the world's most valuable company, diminishes Jobs' legacy. If he was so crucial to the company, why are they doing better without him? Others say Apple's ongoing success cements Jobs' business reputation because the company is being run by a team that he handpicked and is still releasing products, most notably the third-generation iPad and the iPhone 5, that he helped design. (And Apple's product launches aren't as interesting anymore.) ""It's hard to argue that Apple's great financial performance in the last year diminishes Steve's importance at all. It's safe to say that everything we've seen so far has had Steve's mark on it,"" Segall said. ""From this point forward, not as much. The next year or two should be interesting times for Apple watchers, as Steve's direct influence slips further into the past."" Then there's the issue of the much-maligned new Apple maps, which replaced Google Maps as the default mapping system on iOS 6, Apple's new mobile operating system. Apple CEO Tim Cook issued a rare public apology last month for the maps, which have misplaced or mislabeled multiple streets and landmarks. Who is the next Steve Jobs? A few pundits grumbled that Jobs the perfectionist, with his obsessive attention to detail, never would have allowed Apple to release such a flawed product. Others pointed out that Jobs presided over such Apple flops as MobileMe, a subscription service for owners of Apple products, and Ping, a social network centered around music. Segall doesn't think the maps fiasco will have much impact on Jobs' legacy either way. ""I don't think anyone can conclude that Steve would have made a different decision about releasing Apple Maps,"" he said in an e-mail to CNN. ""But I also don't think Steve would have been as apologetic as Tim Cook was in his open letter. I imagine he would have done something similar to what he did when dealing with the backlash against Apple's ban on Flash. Of course there is a big difference here, in that Flash had a lot of enemies and Google Maps has a lot of fans."" Your thoughts on the next Steve Jobs . In the long term, however, Apple's fluctuating stock price and flaps over maps probably won't do much to change consumers' opinions of the man who birthed their beloved phones and tablets. And if Steve Jobs is remembered decades from now, it'll likely be as the man who invented the iPod, iPhone and iPad, not as the executive who was sometimes a tyrant. Does anybody really care whether Alexander Graham Bell was cranky? ""Among Apple employees, I'd say his reputation hasn't changed one bit. If anything, it's probably grown because they've realized how central his contributions were,"" Lashinsky said. ""History tends to forgive people's foibles and recognize their accomplishments. When Jobs died, he was compared to Edison and Henry Ford and to Disney. I don't know what his place will be in history 30, 40, 50 years from now. And one year is certainly not enough time (to judge)."" How Apple has changed under Tim Cook .","Apple co-founder died a year ago from cancer .

"(CNN) -- The reading specialist who blew the whistle on an academic scandal at the University of North Carolina sued the university Monday, saying she was retaliated against after speaking out. Mary Willingham quit her job in May after she was demoted, and she's now suing to get her original job back. UNC has been under scrutiny since 2011, when it was revealed that it had hundreds of classes in the Afro-American studies program that required no attendance and just a single paper. The issue received national attention after CNN highlighted literacy problems at UNC. In one CNN report, Willingham said the so-called ""paper classes"" were well known by the athletic support staff as easy classes for athletes who needed to stay eligible, and that the papers were often plagiarized. Willingham said she worked with athletes for several years during the time when UNC had the bogus classes. The university admitted to the irregular classes, but denied the issue was anything more than the actions of one rogue professor. That professor, Julius Nyang'oro, was indicted in December on a fraud charge. Orange County District Attorney JIm Woodall said he's considering dropping that charge because Nyang'oro is cooperating. Willingham said that more people knew about the fake classes, and that athletic support staff funneled athletes into the classes to keep eligible the players who couldn't otherwise keep up with rigorous UNC classwork. After speaking to the local newspaper, the News and Observer in 2013, she was demoted and given extra work, her lawsuit says. Then, she says, university officials verbally attacked her in 2014 when CNN featured her in a story about the literacy rates of college athletes nationwide. She has said she felt university officials unfairly attacked her character after she revealed research on a selection of athletes who were reading at elementary school levels. A whistle-blower group came to her defense earlier this year, saying the university should launch an investigation into the public harassment of Willingham by UNC officials. In May, she announced she was leaving her job because of the hostile work environment, but said she loved working with students and hoped to be able to return. ""It will crush me to not be able to come to work here every day,"" she said in March. ""I don't really look forward to that day at all."" ""The train has left the station, people are talking about NCAA reform, and my university is not even in the station,"" she said. ""Instead they are attacking my character. That is not a leadership. Leaders focus on the issue, not on the people."" The press she generated caused UNC to launch a new investigation into academic fraud. That investigation is underway and being conducted by former federal prosecutor Ken Wainstein. He recently announced that he has acquired 1.5 million e-mails and documents, talked to 30 athletic support staff, and gotten valuable information from others. He also is looking at transcripts going back to the 1980s, something no other UNC investigation had done. Wainstein also interviewed WIllingham and Nyang'oro, which the NCAA did not do when it first looked at what happened. Wainstein shared his information with the NCAA and this week the NCAA announced it was reopening its investigation. ""There is no doubt in my mind that NCAA gave a gift to UNC by not investigating this obvious fraud,"" said Oklahoma University professor Gerald Gurney. He worked in athletic support for years and has become a critic of the NCAA. He's currently researching academic fraud at many institutions, including UNC. ""UNC is the mother of all academic fraud violations,"" Gurney said. ""I have no doubt that the scale of the North Carolina case constitutes the most significant academic fraud case in the NCAA. Theres no doubt in my mind about cooperation of friendly faculty and the cover-up and the excuses of this kind of behavior that has gone on in the university. ... It's eggregious. ""It's quite likely that if it is shown that this is a long-term systematic scheme on the part of the university that UNC will need to vacate wins,"" Gurney said.

"(CNN) -- Nelson Mandela said a lot of great things. But after his death, he's being widely credited on social media with a phrase he didn't utter. Amid the deluge of tributes to South Africa's first black president, who died Thursday aged 95, many Twitter users were paying homage to Mandela by posting the following quote: . ""Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure."" They attributed the words to Mandela, but as The New York Times reported more than two years ago, the words actually come from a bestselling book by self-help author and spiritual teacher Marianne Williamson. The misattribution to Mandela was already well established in 2011, The Times says, and how he came to be given credit for the quote ""remains a mystery."" His death has now prompted a revival in the mistaken citation. Despite efforts to dispel the confusion, tweets linking Mandela to the quote were still chugging along at a steady rate early Friday, blending in with the array of memorable phrases he really said. Paris Hilton angered by fake tweet . Mandela's death also sparked a more malicious type of misquoting. A Twitter account under the name @DeletedTweets posted a tweet purporting to be from Paris Hilton in which she appeared to misattribute the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech to Mandela. But Hilton later fired back angrily, tweeting, ""Whoever made that stupid fake tweet lacks respect to the loss the world is mourning right now. Same goes for all the blogs who ran with it."" Her real tribute to Mandela? ""He was a true Hero & the world is a better place because of him. May he rest in peace."" By early Friday, the @DeletedTweets account appeared to be inactive. Misquotes of public and historical figures are nothing new. In 1989, two academics published ""They Never Said It: A Book of Fake Quotes, Misquotes and Misleading Attributions."" In the extended exercise in debunking, Paul F. Boller and John George attempted to put paid to misleading myths that had grown up around words linked in the popular consciousness to people like Winston Churchill and George Washington. 'Mangled to meme' But since then, the Internet has dramatically increased the velocity at which such falsities spread. After the killing of Osama bin Laden in May 2011, words incorrectly attributed to King and Mark Twain quickly snowballed on social media. The phrases were being used by people to express discomfort with celebrations of bin Laden's death. In an online inquest into what happened with the mistaken King quote, Megan McArdle of The Atlantic remarked that ""the speed of dissemination is breathtaking: mangled to meme in less than two days."" She also noted the resilience of false quotes. ""Fake quotations are pithier, more dramatic, more on point, than the things people usually say in real life,"" she wrote. ""It's not surprising that they are often the survivors of the evolutionary battle for mindshare."" Some people are using the Internet to try to fight back against rampant misattributions to major figures. The website fakebuddhaquotes.com says it's dedicated to sorting true from false, around 2,500 years after the Buddha's time on earth. Those who would like to keep Mandela's real remarks separate from the fake ones have a long road ahead.","Mandela's death appears to have prompted a revival of the false attribution .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkish security forces barricaded the commercial center of Istanbul in an attempt to stop May Day celebrations from taking place in the city's iconic Taksim Square. Police fired plastic pellets and used tear gas and water cannon in an attempt to disperse May Day demonstrators who tried to defy the ban and reach the city center. Protesters responded by throwing stones and bottles and shooting fireworks at riot police. Similar clashes erupted in the Turkish capital Ankara and the port city of Izmir. Turkish authorities went to great lengths to prevent people from gathering in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city. Citing security threats by extremist groups, the government shut Istanbul's subway system, stopped many commercial ferry services between the European and Asian halves of the city, and blocked vehicular traffic on some of Istanbul's busiest roads. ""Intelligence units have received information that illegal terrorist organizations and their extensions are going to resort to violence against security forces. This situation would create circumstances that would not only disrupt public order and security but also seriously threaten the rights and freedoms of our citizens,"" the Istanbul governor's office announced in a written statement released Wednesday night. The governor's office also justified the ban, arguing that May Day rallies would hurt Istanbul's image as a tourist destination. ""Taksim Square and the surrounding area are not suitable for high attendance gatherings and demonstrations,"" the governor's office wrote. ""In Taksim vehicular and pedestrian traffic is intense and the area has great tourism potential with 24/7 tourist hotels, so negative developments in this area would negatively impact the country economy, tourism potential and the marketing image of our country."" But the shut-down of the city center left many foreign tourists bewildered, as police turned them away from barricades. Some visitors could be seen dragging suitcases through empty and barricaded streets in a confused search for hotels. ""Closed,"" a police officer said, turning away an elderly European couple trying to enter Taksim Square. The sprawling pedestrian area was all but deserted throughout the day on Thursday, with the exception of security forces, a handful of journalists, and wandering flocks of pigeons. For decades, May Day, or International Workers Day, has been a day of tension between leftist Turkish labor unions and security forces. Taksim Square holds particular importance to leftist parties, because dozens of people were killed there in a May 1, 1977 rally in which gunfire triggered a deadly stampede. In 2011 and 2012, the ruling Justice and Development Party allowed leftist groups to rally in Taksim for the first time in decades. The gatherings were festive and peaceful, decorated with giant posters of those who died in 1977. But in 2013, the government banned the annual rally, sparking a day of violence that has spiraled into the most politically turbulent year of anti-government protests Turkey has seen in more than a decade. Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been in power since his party first won parliamentary elections in 2002. He frequently denounces his critics, accusing them of being terrorists bent on overthrowing his government. His supporters argue Turkey has grown more democratic during the Erdogan era. They point to his party's sweeping victory in local elections last March, when Justice and Development Party candidates won at least 43% of the national vote. ""We have moved away from a state that saw its citizens as a threat,"" said Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay in a speech earlier this week. But many human rights groups and press freedoms organizations argue the Erdogan government has grown increasingly intolerant of public displays of dissent in recent years. This week, the U.S.-based human rights organization Freedom House downgraded classification of Turkey from ""Partly Free"" to ""Not free."" ""Constitutional guarantees of freedom of the press and expression are only partially upheld in practice, undermined by restrictive provisions in the criminal code and the Anti-Terrorism Act,"" Freedom House said. They also said, ""Turkey remained the world's leading jailer of journalists in 2013.""","Turkish authorities went to great lengths to prevent public gatherings in Istanbul .

"(CNN) -- The swollen Missouri River washed over and punched through levees in northwestern Missouri early Sunday, spurring authorities to urge about 250 nearby residents to leave their homes. The river breached levees at two points overnight and overtopped them at two others near Corning, Missouri, about 100 miles north of Kansas City, the Holt County Sheriff's Department reported. Most residents had already cleared out due to voluntary evacuation calls, but authorities went door-to-door early Sunday to order nearly 30 people who remained to leave, the agency told CNN. Upriver, evacuation advisories went out for 200 to 250 people in the town of Watson and other areas west of Interstate 29, said Mark Manchester, the deputy emergency management director in Atchison County. Water was sloshing over the levees ""at a pretty good clip"" Sunday morning and had already topped the county's previous record mark, set in 1993, he said. ""We're in uncharted waters here,"" Manchester said. The Missouri was more than 11.5 feet over flood stage at nearby Brownville, according to National Weather Service data. And across the state line in Hamburg, Iowa, where two levees failed last week, the river was expected to crest at 10 feet over flood stage in the coming days, Fremont County Emergency Management chief Mike Crecelius said. Crecelius said the river has been over flood stage since late April, and that forecasters are projecting river flows of 150,000 cubic feet (1.1 million gallons) per second through August. ""They're not designed for this amount of pressure for this length of time,"" Crecelius said. ""They've never been tested like this."" Heavy rainfall in Montana and North Dakota, combined with melting snow from the Rocky Mountains, have sent the Missouri surging downstream, according to the National Weather Service. The 6 to 12 inches of rainfall in the upper Missouri basin in the past few weeks is nearly a normal year's worth, and runoff from the mountain snowpack is 140% of normal, the agency says. CNN's Matt Smith and Divina Mims contributed to this report.","NEW: Official raises concern about projected high water flows .

"(CNN)  -- Frustrated parents are dumping their teenagers at Nebraska hospitals -- even crossing state lines to do it -- and the state Legislature has scheduled a special hearing to try to stem the tide. A 14-year-old Iowa girl was left Tuesday at Creighton University Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska. Nebraska's ""safe haven"" law, intended to allow parents to anonymously hand over an infant to a hospital without being prosecuted, isn't working out as planned. Of the 17 children relinquished since the law took effect in July, only four are younger than 10 -- and all four are among the nine siblings abandoned by a man September 24 at an Omaha hospital. On Tuesday, a 14-year-old girl from Council Bluffs, Iowa, was abandoned at Creighton University Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, just across the Missouri River from Council Bluffs. The case marks the first time a parent has crossed state lines to abandon a teenager in Nebraska, authorities said. ""The few situations we've seen so far demonstrate the need for a change in Nebraska's safe haven law,"" Gov. Dave Heineman said in a statement Monday. ""In the coming legislative session, I will advocate for changes that put the focus back on protecting an infant in danger. That should be our priority."" All 50 states have safe haven laws, but only Nebraska's lacks an age limit. Nebraska's part-time Legislature is adjourned until January, but two state legislative committees will hold a joint hearing November 13 to discuss a remedy. ""They've got a huge problem,"" said Linda Spears, vice president for policy and public affairs for the Child Welfare League of America. ""It's a pretty poorly constructed law to meet its original intent."" When it was introduced in the Legislature, the bill had a presumed age limitation of 72 hours, said Todd Landry, director of the state's Division of Children and Family Services. ""The original intent was to protect infants from the immediate danger of being harmed,"" he said. However, the law's final language uses the word ""child"" and does not specify an age limit, leaving it open to interpretation. Other states' laws specify the maximum age at which a child may be relinquished, ranging from 72 hours in several states to 1 year in North Dakota, according to the National Center for State Courts. ""Clearly in these cases so far that we've seen, none of these children were in any immediate danger of being harmed,"" Landry said. ""It is our opinion that the law does need to be modified."" The law is being abused, Heineman's statement said. ""Safe haven laws were not designed to allow families having difficulty with older youth and teenagers to abandon their children or responsibilities as parents,"" he said. The parents may not always be to blame, the Child Welfare League's Spears said. ""The original safe haven laws were created for young moms who are having babies who didn't know how to get help. I think these are families with older kids who don't know how to get help and who are in desperate need,"" she said. Most state laws fail to provide for research into who is abandoning babies and why, league spokeswoman Joyce Johnson said. ""Those are the kinds of things we've been wondering about and saying we need to know more about, and you'll never know if you just have a law that says you can anonymously leave a child somewhere, no questions asked,"" Johnson said. New Jersey, she said, is an exception. That state's safe haven law provides funding for research and evaluation as well as $500,000 a year for public awareness, according to a September 2007 report by a New Jersey safe haven task force. A woman who dropped her 15-year-old nephew at a Lincoln, Nebraska, hospital told CNN affiliate KETV last month that she and the boy's guardian could no longer handle his behavior problems.  Watch woman explain why she left 15-year-old at hospital » . The woman, Cathy Poulin, said she tried discipline and medication, but nothing worked. The boy's mother died several years ago, and his father left him, she said. ""We had to go to the next level,"" Poulin said. ""He can be made to get help."" The Omaha man who left his nine children, ages 1 to 17, at Creighton University Medical Center was overwhelmed by the sudden death of his wife after the youngest child was born, he told KETV. ""I was with her for 17 years, and then she was gone. What was I going to do?"" Gary Staton said. ""We raised them together. I didn't think I could do it alone. I fell apart. I couldn't take care of them."" Staton is just the kind of parent whom safe haven laws fail to help, Johnson said. ""He was grieving, he didn't have a lot of money, and all those children -- he was trying to figure out how to feed them, how to clothe them, and deal with the grief of losing his wife. He needed help,"" she said. Heineman and Landry urged Nebraska parents who are having trouble coping to call the United Way's 211 resource line or Boys Town, a nationally known nonprofit child services organization based in Nebraska. Other options include community and faith-based support groups, crisis hot lines, treatment centers and other services, Landry added.","Wording of Nebraska 'safe haven' law allows parents to dump teenagers .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A judge Monday named famed radio countdown host Casey Kasem's daughter as the temporary conservator of her ailing father, a spokeswoman said. The conservatorship is in effect until June 20, when a hearing is scheduled on whether to make the conservatorship permanent, according to the Los Angeles County Superior Court spokeswoman Patricia Kelly. ""Justice was finally served! I just won temporary conservatorship over my father's healthcare. We have been vindicated by the court. Thank you for your prayers, well wishes and support through this entire ordeal,"" Kasem's daughter, Kerri Kasem, posted on her Facebook page soon after the order. Later, she added: ""I believe my father's wife fled the country (or possibly went to an Indian Reservation) with my Dad because she knew I would win in court today. The judge ordered, Adult Protective Services, the PVP Attorney and the police to look for him. Please pray that he is safe."" Judge Daniel Murphy also ordered that Casey Kasem's whereabouts be disclosed, the daughter's lawyer said. He had ""grave concern"" for the ""safety, health and well-being"" of Casey Kasem, attorney Troy Martin told CNN. A different judge denied a request by Kasem's children that a temporary conservator be appointed for their father last year. Kasem's daughter Julie Kasem and her husband filed that earlier conservatorship petition, claiming the retired radio host ""has been isolated from his daughters, friends and other family"" by his wife. The judge ruled last year that Kasem was being well cared for by his wife, Jean Kasem. Attempts Monday to contact Jean Kasem's attorney, Craig Marcus, were unsuccessful. The petition last year claimed that daughter Julie Kasem and her husband, Dr. Jamil Aboulhosn, had been unable to check on Kasem's health even though her father signed papers in 2007 giving them the power of attorney over his heath care in the event he was unable to make his own health decisions. They ""have been prevented from exercising their duties"" by Jean Kasem, who has been married to the retired radio host for three decades, the filing argued. ""There is no communication between Jean and us and his daughters,"" said brother Mouner Kasem. ""We have no knowledge of how he is, what he's doing, if he's better, if he's worse, and we're scared that we'll never see him again."" Last year, Kerri Kasem said that her stepmother suddenly barred her sister, her uncle and some of Kasem's friends from seeing him. She said she was perplexed by the decision. Kasem, who for decades hosted radio music countdown shows ""American Top 40"" and ""Casey's Top 40,"" is suffering from Parkinson's disease and ""may have early onset Parkinson's dementia,"" according to a court filing. He retired in 2009. Besides the famed countdown shows, Kasem was also the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon ""Scooby Doo"" and an announcer for NBC. He was a popular DJ and occasional actor before ""American Top 40"" began in 1970. Kasem's kids take stepmom to court . All-time great DJs .

"(EW.com ) -- Seth MacFarlane doesn't make it easy to like him. His smug, smarty-pants shtick seems to be built on the foundation of him being a bit of a pr**k. And the ""Family Guy"" and ""Ted"" creator's one-and-done gig hosting the Oscars a couple of years backâ€”where he whipped up a tizzy of faux outrage with his now-infamous ''We Saw Your Boobs'' numberâ€”didn't exactly help matters. Love him or hate him, though (or simply love to hate him), his naughty-boy sagebrush send-up, ""A Million Ways to Die in the West,"" is actually pretty hilarious. From his sideline obsession with Rat Pack swizzle-stick showmanship to his undeniably clever piggybacking on the small-screen legacy of ""The Simpsons"" and ""South Park,"" MacFarlane is clearly a guy who isn't afraid to borrow from his betters. And his new film is such an unapologetic homage to 1974's ""Blazing Saddles"" that Mel Brooks probably deserves to get a cut of the box-office receipts. Still, MacFarlane manages to make the film his own, goosing Brooks' original formula with hard-R raunchiness and post-modern mischief. While MacFarlane kept himself off-screen in ""Ted"" (he merely provided the profane voice of Mark Wahlberg's fuzzy pal), here he puts himself front and center as Albert Stark--a cowardly and inept sheep farmer in the backwater town of Old Stump, Arizona, circa 1882. At the outset of the film, Albert is cowering at ten paces, face-to-face with a grisly gunslinger, nervously trying to weasel his way out of a duel. His stammering excuses to back out quickly become a sort of manic stand-up routine that encapsulates the theme of the movie, riffing on all the ways that the Old West, contrary to Hollywood legend, is actually a horrible place: the people are stupid yokels, the height of medicine is treating wounds with the pecking beaks of blue jays, and if the Indians don't kill you, the rattlesnakes on the way to the nearest outhouse will. He's like Louis CK in chaps. Ashamed by Albert's lily-livered lack of courage, his schoolmarm girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) dumps him for Foy, the dandy proprietor of the local mustache shop, played with literal whisker-twirling glee by Neil Patrick Harris. Explaining why he's more fit to woo her than Albert is, he says, ''I can give her wrapped candies.'' Albert is encouraged to try and win Louise back by his sexually frustrated, dim-bulb best friend (Giovanni Ribisi), whose prostitute girlfriend (Sarah Silverman with a bottomless grab bag of blow-job one-liners and bodily fluid gags) withholds sex while doing unprintable acts in her day job. But Albert is no match for the deep pockets, bad puns, and luxurious waxed handlebar of Foy. Meanwhile, the area's most wanted desperado, Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson) is on the run from the law, who while hiding out, sends his sharp-shooting beauty of a wife, Anna, (Charlize Theron) into town to lay low. Which is fine by her. She hates the scoundrel and only married him because she was nine at the time and afraid of becoming a spinster. Needless to say, Anna and the harmless, good-hearted Albert bond over how dreadful and absurd range life is. Eventually she hatches a scheme for them to pose as an item to make Louise jealous while she teaches him how to shoot a gun and grow a pair. MacFarlane, who wrote the script with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild, keeps the gags flying like hot lead out of a Colt .45. And for every three that don't land, one or two hit the bullseye. There are probably a few too many lazy fart and diarrhea jokes for some, but 14-year-old boys will love it. And while the self-satisfied MacFarlane may give himself a little too much credit and face time as a leading man (I couldn't help thinking he looks like Peter Brady, and his knack for laughing at his own gags is slightly grating), Theron displays a stunning set of razor-sharp comedic chops that she's rarely been given the chance to show off. It suits her as well as the bustle gown she wears to the local hoedown. ''Why are the Indians so mad?'' she asks at one point. ''We're basically splitting the country 50/50 with them!'' I don't know if ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" will turn any of the MacFarlane haters into fans. But for those of us who have remained on the fence until now, his raunchy, rat-a-tat parody is proof that beneath all of the bratty immaturity lays the head and heart of an outrageous quick-draw satirist.

"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Monday will rule on a politically-charged Obamacare appeal involving a requirement that certain, for-profit businesses provide contraceptive coverage to their employees. Can those employers avoid the requirement if they object on moral or religious grounds? Can they do so if they see this as a requirement that can -- in their view -- ultimately lead to abortion? That's what the justices have weighed over several months. Here are five questions to consider in advance of their decision, which incidentally is the last of the term and should come down shortly after 10 a.m. ET. 1. How big is this case? It's the most closely watched one this term. The legal and social pique may not reach the heights of two years ago when the justices narrowly preserved the Affordable Care Act and how it is paid for. But the stakes are still large, and the decision could serve as a primer for other pending challenges to the health law championed by President Barack Obama and in play as a campaign issue this midterm season as Republicans seek to retake the Senate. ""This case isn't that practically important, except for the employees and businesses involved. There just aren't a huge number of those,"" said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com and a Washington appellate attorney. ""But everyone can agree the social questions presented-- about when people can follow their religious convictions, and when people are entitled to contraception care-- are truly important,"" he said. 2. What's the case about? The court is zeroing in on part of the health care law that requires certain employers to offer insurance coverage for birth control and other reproductive health services without a copay -- even when the employers say doing so would violate their religious beliefs. The decision actually stems from separate appeals filed by two companies, Conestoga Wood Specialties, a Pennsylvania cabinet maker, and Hobby Lobby, an Oklahoma-based retail giant. Conestoga employs about 1,000 people, while Hobby Lobby has roughly 13,000 workers. Companies say it's wrong for the government to require they provide insurance coverage for, say, drugs that would be provided to prevent human embryos from being implanted in a woman's womb, which the business owners equate to abortion. Under the law, companies that refuse to comply could be fined more than $1 million daily. 3. Who says what? The White House and its allies say the requirement is ""lawful and essential to women's health."" The Obama administration has defended it in court, and has already created rules exempting certain nonprofits and religiously-affiliated organizations, like churches, from the requirement. In those cases, women would receive coverage from another source at no cost. Supporters of the law also fear a high court setback on the contraception mandate will lead to other healthcare challenges on religious grounds, such as do-not-resuscitate orders and vaccine coverage. More broadly, many worry giving corporations religious freedom rights could affect laws on employment, safety, and civil rights. Hundreds of advocates and demonstrators on both sides are expected to rally in front of the courthouse on Capitol Hill. 4. How will the court rule? The justices have a good deal of discretion and could reach a ""compromise"" by interpreting the law narrowly. Conservatives, in theory, have the five votes to strike or severely limit the contraception mandate. But some on the bench may worry about the long term impact in overruling large parts of a law passed by Congress, and now being carried out in stages. On the other hand, only one conservative justice who sides with the four more liberal members would be enough to give another huge legal boost to Obamacare. Liberals in general have criticized the conservative majority high court for being overly sympathetic to business interests. 5. How did we get here? This is the next chapter in the pitched legal fight over the Affordable Care Act that was approved by Congress in 2010 without any Republican support. Obama and Democratic allies moved forward to help provide insurance coverage for tens of millions of Americans without it. So far, 9 million people have signed up for benefits since last October, but Republicans claim the program is too expensive and won't work. The first lawsuits challenging the healthcare overhaul began just hours after Obama signed it into law. The landmark June 2012 decision upheld key parts of Obamacare, ensuring that it would move forward just before the President's reelection. Nearly 50 pending lawsuits have been filed in federal court from various corporations challenging the birth control coverage benefits. But the Supreme Court will have the final say on those with its decision on Monday. A Mennonite family's fight over Obamacare reaches . Opinion: How Obamacare can reduce abortions .

"(CNN) -- Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is to serve one year of community service at a nursing home for his conviction on tax fraud, a Milan court ruled on Tuesday. The 77-year old billionaire tycoon must visit a center for the elderly near his hometown, Milan, at least once a week for a minimum four hours. He will start the sentence ""in coming days,"" a member of his legal team told CNN. The center-right politician was convicted of charges related to a vast tax fraud conspiracy at his Mediaset television empire. He will be working in a home run by the Sacred Family Foundation, Fondazione Sacra Famiglia, in Cesano Boscone outside Milan. Travel restrictions . The lawyers said the former premier was also subject to limitations on his movements. This means he will not -- except with specific authorization -- be able to leave the northern Lombardy region, where he has his principal home, but is allowed to go to Rome from Tuesday to Thursday. He has to be back in Lombardy by 11 p.m. Thursday. Berlusconi, who served on and off as prime minister between 1994 and 2011, has dominated the lively Italian political scene for the past two decades. He received a sentence of four years for tax fraud. The sentence was commuted to a year. It was not immediately clear from the court ruling whether Berlusconi would be able to campaign for his Forza Italia party ahead of European Parliament elections next month.

"(CNN) -- The lunch hour is usually hectic at Duos Catering in Seattle. But Thursday the phone was ringing off the hook. In between orders of crab cakes and pan seared scallops, many people wanted to congratulate Benjamin Jury and Joshua Cooper. The longtime couple could finally get married legally in Washington, according to ballots tallied from Tuesday's election. The state has joined Maine and Maryland, which have passed ballot measures making same-sex marriage legal. Voters approve same-sex marriage on Election Day . After nearly two days of counting in Washington, the voting broke down this way: 1,269,917 residents are in favor of it while 1,146,439 are not. By early afternoon Friday, 75% of precincts were reporting results. ""In the past, getting married wasn't something that I thought was possible,"" Jury, 33, told CNN. ""It never crossed my mind that I would get married. But after falling in love with Josh, and him just being a part of my life, how could we be given everything but the right to marry? Now it's so real, and it feels equal."" Cooper said he proposed marriage in January while the two vacationed in Thailand. They had been together for years. They started their business together. Their families adored each other. In every respect, they felt like partners for life. If the state was only going to recognize them as domestic partners, that was unfortunate, they thought. But it wasn't going to stop them from committing to each other symbolically. ""We had a kind attitude if the state didn't see us as being married, at least we can,"" Cooper said. ""I would still tell people that he was my husband. But this is special. This right, this vote, it means a lot."" Proponents of same-sex marriage echoed the couple's jubilation this week. On Tuesday, Wisconsin elected the United States' first openly lesbian senator, Democrat Tammy Baldwin. A re-elected President Obama became the first president to openly support same-sex marriage. Also on Tuesday, Minnesota rejected a ban on same-sex marriage. Back in Washington, Jeff Dorion and Ryan Hicks were thrilled that after 11 years together they could legally wed. They're heading to a courthouse December 10. ""We were engaged sort of but we never really called it that because we felt we couldn't,"" Dorion said. Late Tuesday night as the first election results began coming in, his friends began getting in touch. They were overjoyed, many believing that same-sex marriage would be victorious in Washington, as it had been in Maine and Maryland. Relatives living in Germany called to congratulate him. ""I was cautious at first,"" he said. But when opponents conceded defeat and news organizations began calling results, he was all smiles. Thursday afternoon, Dorion changed his Facebook status to ""engaged."" ""We got so many responses,"" he laughed. ""That got everyone's attention!"" While gay rights proponents celebrate this week, many are looking to the U.S. Supreme Court. The justices are expected to decide November 20 on whether to weigh several cases including whether the federal government can deny benefits to married same-sex couples.","1,269,917 residents voted for same-sex marriage; 1,146,439 voted against .

"London (CNN) -- Hopes that this weekend's Japanese election will deliver a major policy shift towards delivering higher growth and inflation have given the country's financial markets a long-overdue shot in the arm. Stock markets have rallied, up 10% on the month to their highest levels since April. The yen, which was recently within touching distance of its post-war high, causing agony for Japan's manufacturers, has eased to eight-month lows. And Japan's long-term interest rates have fallen to their lowest levels since 2003. Optimism hangs on the electoral rhetoric of LDP leader Shinzo Abe, odds-on to be Japan's next prime minister. Exasperated by Japan's two lost decades and persistent deflation, Abe has demanded aggressive action from Japan's central bank, calling for it to generate 2% inflation and do whatever necessary -- including buying an ""unlimited"" amount of government bonds -- to hit that target. And harking back to days gone by, Abe has called for new budgetary stimulus too, including extra public works spending. But could an Abe-led government really snap Japan out of its seemingly interminable economic malaise? Of course, campaigning and governing are two very different things. And, given the perilous state of Japan's public finances, the next government will have precious little room for maneuver to boost public investment. Dangerous waters: Behind the islands dispute . Indeed, it will have countless unpalatable budgetary decisions to make, not least making the social security system affordable given Japan's rapidly aging population. So, in practice, fiscal policy is unlikely to be able to provide meaningful stimulus over the term of the next government. That means that the onus will be on monetary policy to boost growth and inflation. Following rebuttals from present Bank of Japan Governor Shirakawa, Abe recently toned down his attacks on the central bank. But the LDP manifesto maintained Abe's commitment to a 2% inflation target, with legislative action to be considered to force the Bank of Japan's hand if it does not co-operate. Of course, whether an LDP-led government can amend laws related to the central bank, or will in large part depend on the election outcome. But even if Abe secures a comfortable majority in the Lower House, given its lack of control of the Upper House, it might struggle to secure the working majorities it will need in the Diet to pass legislation comfortably. Certainly, a government reliant on a number of parties to pass legislation may mean that complicated reforms to shake up the Bank of Japan are likely to remain more of a threat than a reality. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Chris Scicluna.","Former PM Shinzo Abe is campaigning on joint monetary and fiscal stimulus to end persistent deflation .

"(CNN) -- Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba confirmed his switch to China's Shanghai Shenhua on Wednesday, a move which will reunite him with former Chelsea teammate Nicolas Anelka. Drogba announced he would leave Chelsea days after scoring the penalty which beat Bayern Munich in last month's European Champions League final, and the 34-year-old has signed a two-year deal to become the Chinese Super League's latest high-profile star. The two-time African footballer of the year will reportedly be paid Â£200,000 ($315,000) a week, which would make him China's highest-paid player. ""I have considered all the offers I have received in the past few weeks, but feel that Shanghai Shenhua FC is the right move for me at this time,"" said Drogba in a statement released through his representatives. ""I am looking forward to a new challenge, to experiencing a new culture, and I'm excited about the new developments in the Chinese Super League. ""I hope to help promote Chinese football around the world and further improve the links between China and Africa."" Former France international Anelka made the move from Stamford Bridge to Shanghai in January and even had a brief spell as the team's coach following Jean Tigana's exit in April. Former Argentina coach Sergio Batista is now in charge of the team, and he is looking forward to working with former Marseille star Drogba. ""Drogba is a very good soccer player, his outstanding skills and amazing experience will give us motivation to improve our games,"" said Argentina's 1986 World Cup winner. ""It is my honor to invite him to join in our team. At last I have to say that the club owner Zhu Jun did his utmost to bring Drogba to Shenhua."" Shanghai is currently 12th in the league, with only three wins all season. But Shenhua owner Zhu is confident Drogba can have a positive impact on results as he seeks his first title since taking over in 2007 -- and the club's first since 2003. Drogba scored 157 goals for Chelsea in his eight seasons at the club, winning three English Premier League titles, four FA Cups and two League Cups as well as the London club's long-awaited first European crown. ""We have been wanting to sign Didier for a while, and are very happy that it has finally happened,"" said Zhu. ""He is an incredible player, who has won so many trophies in his career, we feel that his experience and ability will be a very valuable asset to our squad. ""Shanghai is one of the most influential cities in the world, and we are very excited to welcome Didier here."" Drogba and Anelka are two of a number of soccer stars to have joined China's premier football competition. Italy's World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi is now in charge at Guangzhou Evergrande, an ambitious club who in the last year have signed Argentine Dario Conca and Paraguay's Lucas Barrios.","Didier Drogba signs a two-year deal with China's Shanghai Shenhua .

"Washington (CNN) -- This year, despite the recession and record-high unemployment, Americans appear to be getting into the holiday spirit by starting to shop again. This isn't necessarily a bad thing given that consumer spending makes up more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Americans, however, should not go into debt to buy presents. Just as important, they need to start saving before they spend. It may sound like Scrooge to argue for saving during the holidays, but saving is essential if American families and the economy ever are to recover from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Returning to business as usual without fundamentally recalibrating our household finances will just lead to the inflation of the next bubble. Easy credit helped get us into this mess, and credit cards and mortgages will be harder to come by from here on out. Americans are going to need savings to pay for emergency expenses or to make a down payment on a house. We're also going to need them to pay for long-term expenses, such as the rising cost of college tuition for our kids and retirement. Increasing savings is also good for the economy as a whole. When the economy is healthy, banks lend the money we save back out to businesses that produce the goods and services that, in turn, help grow the economy and create jobs. As Americans' savings rates declined over the past several decades, businesses and the government started borrowing more heavily from foreign countries, like China, to pay for these investments. But the cost of this borrowing is likely to rise and is not sustainable. We need more homegrown savings to fuel our economic growth. The past year has been a good one for savings, with the personal savings rate rising from near zero earlier in the decade to nearly 4½ percent in October. But it seems that Americans aren't saving enough, and further action is needed to make sure that this becomes a habit and not just a temporary fad. A recent survey by the TNS group, with assistance from Harvard Business School and Dartmouth College, found that almost half the respondents couldn't come up with $2,000 for an emergency in a month from savings, family or borrowing. These numbers are probably even worse for lower-income families who most need savings to fall back on. Another survey, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., revealed that more than a quarter of Americans do not have a bank account or have one but prefer to use high-priced alternative financial services, such as check cashers and payday lenders instead. It difficult to start saving if you don't even have an account or you're paying exorbitant fees for basic financial services and products. Savings starts with individual behavior, but there are steps the government can and should take to help us do this. President Obama has proposed automatically signing up all workers for IRAs in the workplace along with expanding the Saver's Credit, a tax credit that matches the retirement savings of low-income individuals. These are an excellent first steps, but if we are going to transform our financial habits, bolder action is required. Congress is discussing one such deal: Giving every child a savings account at birth with a small initial deposit. Every child would be able to start saving on Day One, gaining valuable financial education and building savings for college or a down payment on a home as they grow up. Improving the way Americans manage their personal finances will take time and an effort by individuals, government and business. The holiday season exemplifies our worst tendencies to overspend, so it's the best place to make a stand. It starts with you and your pocketbook, but a little catchy marketing never hurt either. Move over Black Friday and Cyber Monday, it's time for Piggybank Wednesday. The opinions in the commentary are solely those of David Newville.","David Newville: Americans are shopping again this season but shouldn't go into more debt .

"(CNN) -- German prosecutors ordered the arrest this week of a German citizen on suspicion of spying for foreign intelligence agencies. A day later, on Friday, the German foreign office called in the U.S. ambassador to discuss it. Foreign Secretary Stephan Steinlein ""requested the U.S. ambassador participate in a rapid solving"" of the spying case, Germany's foreign office said in a statement. Both the German prosecutor and the foreign office released scarce information, but officials have spoken in detail with German journalists, who published many reports on the allegations of renewed U.S. spying on the country. The reports re-inflamed public anger at the U.S. government. The suspect, a German intelligence employee, allegedly stole government documents, according to German media reports. These included papers taken from the German parliament's special committee to address the National Security Agency spying.

"(CNN) -- What is the Obama Doctrine? As the President put it Wednesday, ""Just because we have the best hammer does not mean that every problem is a nail."" The Obama Doctrine, as outlined by the President at the commencement ceremony at West Point, can be summarized as limiting the use of American power to defending the nation's core interests and being smart enough to avoid the temptation to use such power when it embroils the country in costly mistakes such as the decision to invade Iraq. Obama was attempting to answer a central question: What strategic doctrine should guide U.S. actions in a world where America's long war against core al Qaeda and its Taliban allies is winding down, at the same time that Russia and China are both flexing their muscles and when a number of al Qaeda affiliates in countries such as Syria are enjoying something of a resurgence? The President's answer is the foreign policy equivalent of medicine's Hippocratic oath ""first do no harm."" Without directly saying so, it amounts to a cautious but firm repudiation of the decisions made by presidents such as George W. Bush and Lyndon Johnson, who ordered massive commitments of American military power against perceived enemies. A foreign policy of judicious restraint that doesn't sacrifice core American interests is not the sort of foreign policy that lends itself well to emotional rhetoric. But that's exactly Obama's point; it is American hubris and overreach since World War II in wars such as Vietnam and Iraq that cost the nation dearly in blood and treasure, while doing little to protect America's core interests. But the President also said that the United States reserved the right to take unilateral military action when standing up for core American interests, which he defined as ""when our people are threatened, when our livelihood is at stake or when the security of our allies is in danger."" What does the Obama Doctrine mean in practice? In cases where there is no core American interest at stake, but where there are issues of concern to the global community, the President says the United States should lead multilateral efforts to resolve them. An example of this -- which, interestingly, the President didn't cite in the speech -- was the 2011 American-led intervention to topple Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi to prevent him killing large numbers of his own civilians, an effort that both NATO and the Arab League led. The Obama Doctrine means more money for U.S. Special Forces. While Special Forces occupy only a tiny percentage of the American defense budget, they are the tip of the spear when it comes to partnering with countries that have some kind of al Qaeda presence and enabling local forces to go after such groups. At West Point, Obama announced that he would go to Congress to seek a new $5 billion fund for counterterrorism training efforts in countries in North Africa and Asia, an effort that will be led by Special Forces. This dovetails with what Adm. William McRaven, commander of U.S. Special Operations Command, has pushed for over the past year or so -- a greater Special Forces presence in many countries around the world to partner with host nations and train them to fight al Qaeda affiliates or other groups aligned with al Qaeda's ideology. In Syria, the Obama Doctrine means working with Turkey and the Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia to increase funding and other kinds of assistance to the more moderate elements of the Syrian opposition and also to identify extremist groups better to make sure aid is getting to the right groups. On Iran, the Obama Doctrine means continuing negotiations with the Iranian regime to modify its nuclear program, where the President sees that ""for the first time in a decade, we have a very real chance of achieving a breakthrough agreement -- one that is more effective and durable than what would be achieved through the use of force."" It also means closing the Guantanamo prison camp since, after all, the indefinite detention of prisoners doesn't fit with American ideals. Over the past year the Obama administration has made some quiet progress on that front, releasing two Algerians and three Chinese Uyghur prisoners. A further six of the remaining 154 prisoners in Gitmo will also soon be transferred to Uruguay. But will the Obama Doctrine be seen as the right strategy to guide American foreign policy for many years in the future? To answer that question it is worth examining what strategies have guided American foreign policy since the defeat of the Nazis almost seven decades ago. The holy grail of American foreign policy makers is to establish a national security strategy (or doctrine) that deals with the real threats that the United States faces as they change over time. But coming up with such a strategy that actually informs effective policies is relatively rare. Since World War II there have been two doctrines that could be described as more or less unalloyed successes. At the dawn of the Cold War, George Kennan established the doctrine of ""containment,"" which attempted to block Soviet expansionism through a combination of American political and economic efforts that included the establishment of U.S.-led institutions such as NATO, the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Sometimes containment also meant that the United States fought proxy military conflicts with the Soviets, such as the Vietnam War, where the two superpowers backed different sides in a civil war. The intent of this strategy was to contain the Soviets, and yet, at the same time, to avoid becoming embroiled in an outright war that might end with mutually assured destruction. Containment succeeded brilliantly because ultimately the Soviet Union imploded of its own internal contradictions without a shot being fired in what could have become an Armageddon-like U.S.-Soviet nuclear war. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Gen. Colin Powell came to be associated with the ""Powell Doctrine,"" which was a response to the Vietnam War debacle. The Powell Doctrine was to go in at the beginning of a war with overwhelming forces to achieve clearly defined political objectives -- and then to end the conflict without getting bogged down in a lengthy occupation. The classic example of the Powell Doctrine in practice was the 100-hour war the United States waged against Saddam Hussein in 1991, which defeated the Iraqi army that had occupied Iraq's neighbor Kuwait, and did so with relatively few American casualties. Following the 9/11 attacks, came the Bush strategy of the war on terror that was the basis for the U.S.-led coalition's successful overthrow of the Taliban in Afghanistan. But after that it also became the basis for the unnecessary and costly war against the Iraqi dictator. As a strategy the war on terror can hardly be judged a success alongside containment or the Powell Doctrine. So how might history judge the Obama Doctrine? The doctrine will not satisfy some of Obama's critics, who want him to ""do more"" on issues such as Russia's intervention in Ukraine. But it does dovetail neatly with where a large majority of Americans are right now. They have no appetite for any more land wars. According to a CNN poll in December, the 13-year war in Afghanistan has become arguably the most unpopular in American history. What Obama did in his West Point speech was to chart a course that balances two natural, and contradictory, American national security impulses -- isolationism and interventionism -- and points to a hybrid approach that avoids some of the pitfalls of either of these strategic approaches.","President Obama outlines his version of the Kennan, Bush and Powell doctrines .

"(CNN) -- As President Barack Obama once again announced his intention to bypass Congress and govern through executive order -- this time with Monday's announcement on immigration -- history will ask, is he being presidential or imperial? Let us consider how his acute use of presumed authority measures up against rulers of other great nations. History is replete with the chronicles of kings and leaders from biblical times to the present day. In the Scriptures, we encounter King David, who sought to do good in the eyes of God, observed the limits of his kingly mandate and brought relative security and prosperity to his people. Others, including King Saul, exalted themselves, debasing their character and leading Israel into the vicissitudes of calamity, defeat and ruin. The great kings of history are known to have protected their sovereignty effectively, some through benevolent decree and others through ignominious achievements. Caesar Augustus brought an extended period of peace to Rome. Genghis Khan expanded his empire with efficient brutality. Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II abolished slavery and serfdom in the Austrian Habsburg dominions. Napoleon Bonaparte was known for his superior military capabilities and established the Napoleonic Code, which forbade privilege based on birth. All ruled with relatively unchallenged decree. Democracy took root in ancient Greece during the sixth century B.C. Members of society were given a voice and vote in a representative democracy that dispersed political power among the people. Many centuries later emerged the Magna Carta after British subjects demanded from their king the right to vote, personal freedoms and participation in government. Our Constitution contains freedoms original to the Magna Carta. The evolution of our American democracy came through the wisdom of James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, John Locke and other thoughtful intellectuals who envisioned a purposely divided government, with checks and balances through executive, judicial and legislative branches. In contrast to this vision and the obligations set forth in the Constitution, Obama has openly asserted that he will utilize his pen and his phone (and already has) to change policy through executive orders (royal decrees). His unilateral display of power through executive orders circumvents the checks and balances of Congress and the limits of constitutional law, which he should know well as a former law professor. Our founders created executive orders for emergencies during a time of travel by horseback when swift return by Congress was impossible. This era has passed. Many presidents have used executive orders to make recess appointments and other actions, but Obama has issued executive orders to force major policy changes by decree, going well beyond the actions of some other leaders, misusing these emergency powers to enact his will and ignoring the people's elected representatives. Acting without authorization, the President has altered Obamacare, choosing not to enforce sections harmful to his friends and donors in government, unions and big business. He has expanded the regulatory scope of the Environmental Protection Agency, pacifying his base of environmentalist supporters at the cost of jobs for ordinary, hard-working Americans. When Congress acted on behalf of the American people and did not seek passage of the Dream Act, the President used executive order (royal decree), leading to our current humanitarian crisis at the border of unaccompanied children unable to provide for themselves. As if living in a different century, Obama acts unilaterally, uninhibited by what he views as the ""nuisance"" of Congress. Most recently, he undermined our national security and impaired the safety of our soldiers by deciding to free five Taliban commanders without consulting Congress before their release. When we think of kings, we think not only of how they ruled but how they lived. Their lavish castles and opulent feasts. Their lack of consideration as lower classes struggled. ""Let them eat cake."" So, too, is the perceived case with our President. In an economy with anemic growth from the President's failed policies, where high unemployment has become the norm with 20 million people either under- or unemployed, a $17.5 trillion debt and dependence on the government required for all too many, Obama appears unaffected. Our President fully enjoys the pleasures of his office. He vacations extensively, departing at will on Air Force One to luxurious resorts in Florida, California and Hawaii, where his advance team (traveling at taxpayer expense) scopes out the best golf courses. Meanwhile, ordinary tax-paying families are cutting or restricting their vacations. Obama's behavior seems to fit better the description of royalty rather than president. While history records kings both celebrated and maligned, the President must realize he is not ruling in the centuries of kings. The media would do well to come to this realization and end their praise of this ""President by fiat."" We have a carefully, purposely divided government and a system that has proven over two centuries to work remarkably well. The President's contempt for the Constitution and Congress should not be celebrated. Tragically, Obama will go down neither as a great king nor as a thoughtful president who led the country through the rule of constitutional law and representative democracy.

"(CNN) -- A bug in Apple's mobile operating system allows hackers to take control of iPhone and iPad apps, using them to steal people's photos, contacts and even send text messages without the device's user knowing about it, according to a notable computer security researcher. Charlie Miller, a researcher at Accuvant and one of the world's best-known Apple hackers, said Tuesday that the bug proves the Apple App Store isn't as safe as advertised. ""Until now, you could just blindly trust and download as many apps as you wanted and not worry about it,"" Miller said in an interview with CNN. ""But until they fix this, you really should think twice about any apps you're downloading, because they could be malicious."" Miller said he alerted Apple to the bug three weeks ago and the company told him a fix was in the works. Apple did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the apparent security flaw, which Miller explains in detail on YouTube. He plans to show people how the bug works at an upcoming computer security conference in Taiwan, called SyScan. To date, he has not released details that would allow hackers to take advantage of the apparent security flaw, and he said he has no evidence that hackers have used the hole to manipulate iPhones and iPads. Miller says he has exposed the bug to prevent a hacker with bad intentions from taking advantage of iPhone and iPad owners. As thanks for that work, he said, Apple banned him from the iOS developer program for a year. ""I think it's pretty rude,"" he said. ""If you think about what I'm doing -- I'm pointing out a flaw that would affect everybody and that the bad guys could use to install malware (malicious software). And they're not paying me, I'm just doing it to be nice."" He did upload an app, called Instastock, which was armed with this capability, he said. That app only was capable of hurting his own devices, he said, and was uploaded to the App Store to test the bug. ""It's not evil or bad or anything,"" he said. ""It never even downloads code and runs it unless I run it."" It since has been removed from the App Store. If hackers found the security flaw, he said, any iOS app could be compromised in a way that malicious code could be installed through the app and onto the device. ""It could grab your address book and ship it off to the bad guy,"" he said. ""It could grab all your photos and ship them off to a bad guy."" That's a big deal for Apple's App Store, he said, since until now, that online marketplace for iPhone and iPad programs had been free of malicious software. Apple checks each app before it's approved for sale at the App Store, which allows the company to keep bugs out. This hack could take advantage of a flaw in that checking system to compromise any app, Miller said. He said that essentially reduces the App Store's security to that of the Google Android Market, since Google doesn't screen apps in the way Apple does. But overall, the App Store is still safer than the Android Market, Miller said. ""It's totally just a blip,"" he said of the security hole. ""I'm very happy with the way (Apple has) designed the system to prevent malware. It's really the ideal situation."" He added: ""It's a very safe environment except for this. It just shows that you've never completely safe.""","Researcher: iOS flaw raises questions about App Store's security .

"(CNN) -- Rivers are the arteries of our infrastructure. Flowing from highlands to the sea, they breathe life into ecosystems and communities. A levee breach in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River System could have dire effects, a new report says. But many rivers in the United States are in trouble. Rivers in Alaska, California and the South are among the 10 most endangered, according to a report released Tuesday by American Rivers, a leading river conservation group. The annual report uses data from thousands of rivers groups, local governments, environmental organizations and citizen watchdogs to identify waterways under imminent threat by dams, industry or development.  ""Our nation is at a transformational moment when it comes to rivers and clean water,"" said Rebecca Wodder, president of American Rivers. ""Water is life, yet our nation's water infrastructure is so outdated that our clean drinking water, flood protection and river health face unprecedented threats."" American Rivers has released its annual endangered rivers report since 1986. The report is not a list of the nation's most polluted waterways, but highlights 10 rivers facing decisions in the coming year that could determine their future. Here is American Rivers' Most Endangered Rivers list for 2009: . 1) Sacramento-San Joaquin River System . Location: California . Outdated water and flood management puts California's largest watershed at the top of America's most endangered rivers list for 2009. A recent breach in the delta's 1,100-mile levee system could have dire effects on surrounding ecosystems, farming and agriculture, commercial fishing and California's civil infrastructure. State and federal authorities are looking at alternative water-management strategies for the river system, which serves 25 million Californians and more than 5 million acres of farmland. 2) Flint River . Location: Georgia . The Flint is one of 40 rivers nationwide that still flow undammed for more than 200 miles. Conservationists say that dams proposed by Georgia lawmakers would bury more than 50 river miles, destroy fishing and boating opportunities and cost taxpayers millions of dollars. The American Rivers group believes that fixing the state's leaky pipes, using water meters and minimizing water waste would be a cheaper and more cost-effective alternative. 3) Lower Snake River . Location: Idaho, Washington, Oregon . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has built four dams to irrigate and generate energy for the Northwest, but these dams also prevent salmon and steelhead trout from reaching their spawning areas. Every year, those dams kill as many as 90 percent of juvenile salmon and steelhead trout that migrate downstream to the ocean. Conservationists say that removing the dams would eliminate a growing flood threat in Lewiston, Idaho, and create an opportunity to modernize the region's transportation and energy systems. 4) Mattawoman Creek . Location: Maryland . A highway development project here jeopardizes one of the Chesapeake Bay's few remaining healthy streams. The project threatens clean water sources, thousands of acres of forests and wetlands, and an internationally-renowned, multimillion-dollar largemouth bass fishery. 5) North Fork of the Flathead River . Location: Montana . A proposed coal-mining project across the Canadian border puts Montana's North Fork of the Flathead River in jeopardy. An estimated 50,000 acres of the Flathead headwaters could be transformed into an industrial gas field. The projects threaten the river's clean water, local agriculture, fish and wildlife and recreational industries such as rafting, camping, fishing and boating. American Rivers and its partners have called on local Canadian governments and the U.S. State Department to work together to halt these projects. 6) Saluda River . Location: South Carolina . Excess levels of sewage waste threaten the drinking water of more than 500,000 South Carolina residents, conservationists say. Sewage in the river increases phosphorous and algae levels, depletes oxygen, and kills fish and other aquatic life. American Rivers is asking the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control to improve sewage-treatment standards and ensure the river reduces its phosphorous levels by 25 to 50 percent. 7) Laurel Hill Creek . Location: Pennsylvania . Known for its fishing, swimming and kayaking, this popular vacation spot faces threats from a bottling plant and tourism-related development. Without adequate planning and safeguards, withdrawals will continue to exceed the creek's reasonable capacity, putting recreation, the local water supply, and fish and wildlife in jeopardy. 8) Beaver Creek . Location: Alaska . One of the nation's last wild rivers faces extinction if an oil- and gas-development project constructs 600 miles of roads and pipelines, airstrips, drilling pads, and gravel mines along the creek. Alaska native communities depend on the area for subsistence hunting and fishing. It's also a popular destination for anglers, boaters, skiers and hunters. 9) Pascagoula River . Location: Mississippi . The U.S. Department of Energy wants to hollow out natural salt domes 30 miles northwest of the Pascagoula to create a storage area for up to 160 million barrels of oil. A pipeline 330 miles in length would be constructed to withdraw water from the Pascagoula to dissolve the salt domes and distribute oil to and from the site. The DOE predicts 18 oil spills and 75 spills of salty, polluted water during the construction and initial fill of the hollowed domes, damaging rivers, streams, and wetlands in the basin, conservationists say. 10) Lower St. Croix National Scenic Riverway . Location: Minnesota, Wisconsin . Rezoning of a 26-mile stretch of the river's state-protected section would allow for the construction of a major development on the riverfront. American Rivers believes the development could lead to land erosion along the river and more storm run-off while harming the region's biodiversity. ""Being named as one of America's most endangered rivers is not an end for the river, but rather a beginning,"" said Wodder.

"(CNN) -- Consumer demand for mobile media is growing fast, but the smartphone app market has quickly become heavily saturated and fairly confusing. Perhaps one of the best ways for a company to increase its customer base is to go after the kinds of phones that the majority of mobile users in the U.S. and elsewhere currently have -- feature phones. Feature phones are usually cheaper devices that offer less computing ability than smartphones. This weekend, Facebook acquired Snaptu, a platform that delivers Java-based apps that run on most feature phone models. According to comScore, as of January 2011 only about 28% of all mobile phones in the U.S. were smartphones. This means 72% of U.S. cell phones are feature phones, most of which have a broad array of features, including the ability to run Java-based apps. In January,  Facebook launched a Snaptu-powered feature phone app, which brought easier Facebook access to more than 2,500 mobile devices worldwide. But so far, Facebook's feature phone app is only for use in markets outside the U.S. Recently, the weblog ReadWriteWeb noted that feature phone apps make a lot of sense for companies seeking to grow their user base in emerging mobile markets worldwide. The market for feature phone apps represents a huge growth opportunity right here in the U.S. So I wouldn't be surprised if Snaptu and other feature phone app platforms, such as Getjar, start attracting more interest and investment and start rolling out richer offerings for U.S. mobile users. The main reason for this is that most smartphone data plans are likely to remain pretty costly, and the majority of mobile users are very cost-conscious. Increasing consolidation among U.S. carriers won't bring monthly bills down. For instance, AT&T's newly proposed acquisition of T-Mobile would increase market consolidation by absorbing the lowest-cost major U.S. carrier, which Consumers Union believes will lead to rate increases for current T-Mobile customers (among other problems for consumers). Earlier this year, Qualcomm announced that it's making Opera Mini the default browser on its BREW MP operating system, which powers a huge portion of U.S. feature phones. This move will make Web browsing much easier on feature phones, and it could spark a far greater appetite for mobile content and services among feature phone users. At the same time, feature phones are getting smarter and easier to use. For instance, the new HTC Freestyle, available from AT&T, emulates the HTC Sense Android interface, but it's powered by BREW MP and it doesn't require a two-year contract. When it comes to user experience, apps probably make much more sense on feature phones than smartphones in the long run. One of the great strengths of smartphones is their fully featured, easy-to-use Web browsers. Increasingly these will support HTML5 functionality, which allows Web pages to work more like apps. Since it's much easier and cheaper to develop for the mobile Web than for several native app platforms, a lot of smartphone services that are delivered mainly via apps today probably will migrate to a mobile browser experience. Feature phones will probably always lag behind smartphones in terms of Web browser usability. (Opera Mini is nice and fast, but it's definitely nowhere near the experience of Mobile Safari or Dolphin HD.) So on feature phones, apps are probably the best way to deliver a richer and more user-friendly experience. Of course, wireless carriers would have to play ball for the feature phone app market to grow. Right now, carriers control which Java-based apps customers can download onto feature phones. For the U.S. feature phone app market to take off, carriers would have to loosen restrictions. I doubt Facebook would have bought Snaptu if it only wanted to introduce apps outside of the U.S. They're probably also looking to get an early jump on a huge and largely underserved U.S. consumer market. Stay tuned. The feature phone app space is probably about to get very interesting. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Facebook just bought Snaptu, a platform for apps that run on feature phone models .

"(CNN) -- Miles away from the somber ceremony on a tarmac where coffins containing the remains of victims of Flight MH17 were returned, dozens of forensic scientists at a military base in the Netherlands were preparing for the grim task of identifying the remains. In all, 298 passengers and crew -- among them dozens of children -- were killed when the packed Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 they were on crashed in eastern Ukraine last Thursday. All of the bodies and body parts recovered from the crash site will eventually be brought to Hilversum, Netherlands, where a team of experts from the Dutch national forensics unit (Landelijk Team Forensische Opsporing) will do everything they can to return the dead to their loved ones. ""You don't know which nationality each body is,"" explains Jos van Roo of LTFO. ""So we try to identify all the bodies. We are in contact with the other countries to combine efforts to identify the bodies."" The LTFO has experience of other mass disasters, having worked on the 2004 Asian tsunami, the crash of Afriqiyah Airways Flight 771 in Libya in 2010 and other incidents in the Netherlands. Van Roo says great care has and will continue to be taken over the bodies, out of respect for the victims and to avoid any further distress to their families. Forensics specialist: 'It must be very precise' It is painstaking work, van Roo says: ""There are lot of bodies and body parts coming our way. [Everything] must be examined. ... It must be very precise. You must make sure you don't give the wrong body to the wrong family."" The team's work began days ago on the Ukrainian field near the Russian border where MH17's journey from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur came to a premature end. Forensic genetics expert Denise Syndercombe-Court of King's College London says some identifications will be relatively simple. ""It sounds as if they have perhaps 200 body bags with identifiable bodies or parts of bodies in,"" she says. ""And while they have been at the site for some time, I would expect that it will be possible to get good DNA profiles from most of those."" In some cases, working out who is who may be even easier than that -- if a victim has a distinctive scar or clothing, or even a wallet or passport in a pocket. Dental records can also be used to identify those who are not immediately recognizable. If DNA is needed, it is usually taken from an area of deep muscle. Mitochondrial DNA may also be used. In both cases, the experts will then need to compare the DNA taken from the victim with a relative. Search for DNA matches . But Syndercombe-Court says the fact so many families died on Flight MH17 may complicate the process. ""Where you have lots of family members traveling together, you may have to rely on DNA matches to more distant relatives,"" she explains. ""Once you get beyond the immediate family, beyond grandparents or aunts and uncles, it becomes more difficult."" In those cases, scientists may have to rely on alternative comparisons, matching DNA from the remains to that found on toothbrushes or clothing owned by the dead person. Van Roo says work has already begun to collect details and DNA matches for those on board the plane, with dozens of detectives interviewing family members. ""We have been working with the families of the victims. From them, we ask [for] a description of the victim, and we take DNA, look at the dental records and take fingerprints,"" he told CNN, adding that the process of talking to relatives can take a long time. ""You try to get as much information during your first visit. You don't want to forget some questions. It is very painful to have to get back to families to ask [more] questions."" ""Every bit of information you get from a relative needs to be collected very carefully. Also you need to take records from the bodies. It is a delicate procedure for example, [to] take dental records or DNA."" Syndercombe-Court helped to identify the victims of Yemenia Flight 626, which crashed into the Indian Ocean on its way from Yemen to Comoros in 2009, leaving 152 dead. She says not every victim will be easy to put a name to: Cases where the force of a blast or fire have damaged the remains can be complex. And she says that while experts do have the passenger manifest, some cases may never be fully resolved. But she hopes knowing, at least, that everything possible has been done, and that the remains were handled with great care will offer some solace. ""The longer it goes on, the more difficult it can be. ... If someone is not found, or a body part is never identified, but it is dealt with in a sensitive way, the families know someone has gone to the effort, someone has tried their best."" For the experts at Hilversum, the next weeks and months will be busy and difficult. Van Roo says the work can be emotional, but everyone is united by their common aim. ""We have the drive to give the bodies back to the families,"" he says. ""Every case is unique, [but] you want to get the victim back. The drive stays the same."" Syndercombe-Court agrees: ""It's a tough job, but a good job. ""It is always grim, but we do it with the knowledge that we are helping someone else: The family want to be able to put it to bed, and we want to give them some peace.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The best golfers on the planet can expect beautifully manicured greens and perfect fairways when they take to the Hazeltine National Golf Club course in Minnesota for the U.S. PGA Championship next month. Hitting out of the rough at the ice golf course at Uummannaq in Greenland can be tough. But the increasing popularity of the sport has seen golf courses spring up in some unlikely places. Here Living Golf takes a look at some of the weird and wonderful golf courses which will not be found in the average guidebook: . 1. Longest  The average round of golf usually lasts a few hours, but prospective players on the Nullarbor Links Course in southern Australia can expect to complete the course in closer to four days. Measuring 848 miles in length the course is the longest in the world and spans two time zones with holes situated at 18 towns and service stations aimed along the Nullarbor Plain. 2. Hottest  Situated on the rim of the active Mount Merapi in Indonesia, the Merapi Golf Course is one of the most unusual courses in the world. The course has breathtaking views and is one of only a handful of courses where golf is played next to an active volcano - although the course architects are yet to include lava hazards. 3. Coldest Uummannaq in Greenland is home to the World Ice Golf Championships where the entire course is laid on gigantic icebergs and rounds of golf are played in subzero temperatures. The rules remain the same as regular golf although the course is a little shorter, the holes a little larger, the ball is orange and the green is white. 4. Most dangerous Camp Bonifas is the closest military base to North Korea on the border in Panmunjom and is also home to what has been dubbed the world's most dangerous golf course. The 'course' is a single hole, par three which stretches 192 yards and is close to the most heavily fortified border in the world. And it is no place for a stroll in the rough either - the fairway is ringed by landmines. 5. Back to nature Established in 1993 the golf course of La Jenny in France is one of the few places in the world which caters especially for golfers who prefer to hone their skills au natural. The only naturist course in Europe, La Jenny even has its own professional and stages numerous tournaments throughout the year. Have you played on a stranger golf course? Let us know in the Sound Off box below. 6. Highest If you are struggling to get distance on your drives then head to the Government Golf Course found in Gulmarg, India where the course is the highest in the world at over 8,500 feet. Established by British residents in 1904 the air is thinner on the course because of the altitude which means that the ball will travel further to increase the distance of a drive. 7. Unluckiest hole Jean Van de Velde infamously pondered a chip out of the water at The British Open at Carnoustie in 1999 but he would be well advised to not try the same at the Lost City Golf Course in Sun City, South Africa. The water trap at the 13th hole houses 38 hungry crocodiles which is a graveyard for the balls of hundreds of sliced shots. 8 Full steam ahead Located in a picturesque suburb of the city the Royal Colombo Golf Club in Sri Lanka has the distinguishing feature of the Kelani Valley steam railroad running through the course. Four of the holes are traversed by the trains which run past packed full of people ensuring the golfer will often have a audience, although a drop is permitted if your drive lands on the tracks. 9. Bunker-tastic There is barely a blade of grass in sight in the small opal mining town of Coober Pedy in the Australian outback but that does not hinder the interest in golf. The Opal Fields Golf Club is a giant sand trap while the 'greens' must be oiled with grease to prevent the dirt being blown away by the dry desert winds. 10. Out of this world Astronaut Alan Shepard is the only person to actually hit a golf ball on the moon when he did during 1971's lunar visit, but plans for a course on the cratered satellite are already on the drawing board. Japanese company Shimizu Construction revealed a blueprint for the development of a course for the future, although an intergalactic open championship is probably quite a few years off yet.","Players will have superb course conditions for the U.S. PGA Championship .

"(Mashable) -- Twitter announced an internal patent agreement on Tuesday that it says will empower designers and engineers -- as well as hopefully begin a movement to quell the tech world's rash of patent infringement lawsuits. Publicly revealed in a blog post and dubbed the Innovator's Patent Agreement (IPA), the policy pledges that Twitter will not pursue offensive litigation over patents without the consent of the employees who created them. If someone else sues Twitter over a patent, however, the company can use patents awarded to employees or former employees to defend itself. The IPA has been greeted by many developers as an important step away from the ""patent trolling"" that many tech companies have been accused of recently -- most notably Intellectual Ventures, founded by Microsoft veteran Nathan Myhrvold, as well as Yahoo. Yahoo sued Facebook in March for infringement regarding 10 patents in a move many in the tech world saw as an attempt at extortion. In an opinion piece for Wired, Upcoming.org founder and former Yahoo employee Andy Baio called the suit ""an attack on invention and the hacker ethic,"" explaining why support for Twitter's IPA has been strong. Take, for example, the popular ""pull-to-refresh"" function found in Twitter's iPhone app. News that Twitter had moved to patent the technology -- credited to Loren Brichter, founder of Tweetie, which Twitter acquired in 2010 -- stirred some consternation among techies that the company could pursue aggressive litigation down the line. The new IPA -- which applies retroactively to patents the company has already filed and still gives designers and engineers ultimate power after they leave Twitter -- essentially rules that out. Brichter endorsed the move in a tweet on Tuesday: . @lorenb: Big news for pull-to-refresh, and other patents: blog.twitter.com/2012/04/introd... Incredibly happy to see this moving forward. In Twitter's blog post, vice president of engineering Adam Messinger says the company has begun to ""reach out to other companies to discuss the IPA and whether it might make sense to them, too."" Twitter also posted a draft of the agreement to the online open-source archive GitHub as a way to further spread the word. The move to more formally adopted agreements like Twitter's appears to have already gained some traction among tech companies, as well as developers: Foursquare's engineering lead Harry Heymann said he's a ""big fan"" of the move; Facebook has expressed support for the idea; and the British startup Multizone committed to following suit with this tweet: . @nuxnix: @adam_messinger the IPA is a great innovation. We will adopt it @multizone as we have been struggling with exactly this issue. Thank you . Do you applaud Twitter's IPA? Do you think software patents should exist in their present form?

"Mountain View, California (CNN) -- As Google prepares to add a new category to its arsenal of portable devices with tablets, the company's mobile team is deploying ways to better tie its different systems together. It might not come as a surprise that the internet giant is using the Web to do that. Like smartphones, this new breed of tablets will run Android, an operating system developed by Google. This next version of Android, called 3.0 or Honeycomb, is its first designed for tablets but will also run on smartphones. Like Apple does with its closed system, Honeycomb will let users buy applications on computers and synchronize them between their Google gadgets. Using the Android Market website in a browser, you can browse, buy and download apps, Google announced at a news conference on the company's main campus here on Wednesday. From the website, users can beam the app to any number of phones or tablets connected to their accounts. The phone begins downloading the app almost instantly. This feature has already been enabled automatically on Android phones. Previously, you'd have to open the Android app on a smartphone in order to search for and download programs. Synchronizing between other family members' phones, for example, was a hassle. In Apple's controlled habitat, the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad share information and apps via a central hub in the iTunes software. ""There are no wires, no syncing to computers, none of that kind of nonsense,"" Chris Yerga, Android's engineering director for cloud services, said onstage at the Android event. ""Everything just works seamlessly, syncing between the two."" The announcement reinforces Google's philosophy of doing everything over the internet, or ""cloud"" in industry parlance. Android already synchronizes personal information such as e-mail and contact lists through the Web. ""It's the cloud that makes the experience seamless,"" said Andy Rubin, who leads Android development. But the synchronization features will mean little if Google can't persuade smartphone customers to purchase upcoming Android tablets. So much of Wednesday's event was focused on a walkthrough of new features that will be available to these devices. A new app called Music brings the Android system closer in line with Apple's iPod-iPhone-iPad model. Albums and songs are organized in a screen with a heavy emphasis on cover artwork. Honeycomb also has a live video chat function that will let tablet users talk with other people who are using Gmail on a computer. Apple's portable devices with FaceTime can talk only to Mac computers running a beta program or using Skype's app. Skype does not offer a video-calling app for Android. The new Android software includes improved multitasking functionality, so you can see a window of what apps you were previously using looked like when you closed out of them. All of this runs thanks to a combination of hardware-acceleration techniques for smooth animations. These techniques also help drive more powerful games. Google's partners showed a game called ""Monster Madness,"" which is based on a game originally developed for the PlayStation 3. Developers said they didn't need to make major alterations to get it to work on the tablet. They also showed an action-packed, medieval-themed game that taps into the hardware's multicore processors. Google also attempted to woo attendees and people watching the event's online video stream with a slew of new apps designed specifically for tablets. CNN  announced onstage it will offer an Android app with iReport functions and live video capabilities. The tablets also will be able to run all of Android's 130,000 apps designed for smartphone-sized screens. The apps will fill the tablets' larger screens. ""We've spent a significant amount of effort making sure that existing Android apps run well on tablets,"" Hugo Barra, Android's director of product management, said onstage. The first tablet to launch with the new version of Android is Motorola's Xoom, which debuts this month. An exact release date and pricing have not been set. A Honeycomb tablet from LG, called the G-Slate, will come out in March, T-Mobile USA announced Tuesday evening. In addition to a camera on the front used for video chatting, that device has a pair of cameras on the back for capturing high-definition 3-D photos and video. You'll need 3-D glasses in order to see the video on the tablet's screen. T-Mobile and AT&T also announced more information on new Android phones this week, none of which will run the Honeycomb software at first.","Google launches a website for browsing and downloading apps .

"(CNN) -- Laurie Bolton believes the remains of her Uncle Louis rest at the bottom of the English Channel, with those of other American servicemen who perished in a little-known D-Day training mission that went horribly wrong. Bolton considers newly discovered sonar images of two sunken ships proof of this hallowed ground. Divers recently planted an American flag on the ruins. ""This is a burial ground, so it's very important,"" she told CNN. ""My uncle's body was never recovered, and I believe he's still down there."" On April 28, 1944, the beaches at Slapton Sands along the south coast of England were being used as a training ground because they provided similar conditions to what American troops would encounter in Normandy less than two months later. Thousands of area residents were evacuated. The full-scale rehearsal for the Utah Beach landing included live fire and fully equipped troops to make it as real as possible. The disastrous mission was kept secret, survivors threatened with court-martial if they revealed what happened. Under the cover of night, an American convoy headed out into Lyme Bay, some 15 miles off the coast. The plan was for the ships to organize in the same formations as the D-Day invasion, turn back toward the English beaches and simulate a landing. A small British warship escorted the convoy, according to U.S. military documents chronicling the mission. A larger destroyer that was to escort the convoy remained behind for repairs, leaving the ships vulnerable, according to a study by military historian Charles Brown MacDonald. Around 2 a.m., German torpedo boats opened fire on the convoy, sinking two landing ship tanks, or LSTs, causing a loss of life greater than that suffered on Utah Beach on June 6, 1944, according to U.S. military documents. According to declassified military documents, 749 American servicemen lost their lives during Exercise Tiger. Some have suggested the tally was higher; others say it was lower. Fewer than 200 servicemen were killed or wounded at Utah Beach on D-Day, according to statistics from the Center for Military History. Louis Bolton was killed instantly. ""Many of the men didn't have a chance,"" his niece, a California resident, told CNN. ""It was pitch black. The men didn't have time to react, and many of them ended up drowning with all the heavy gear strapped on their backs."" Louis Bolton was 19 and newly married. His family thought he'd be safe during his deployment to Europe. ""He looked so handsome in his Army uniform and we were so proud of him,"" said Bolton's sister Shirley in a letter. ""We weren't too worried about his safety, as he had been assigned to the 607th Graves Registration Company, so he wouldn't be on the front lines."" Paul Gerolstein, 22 at the time and a gunner's mate aboard one of the LSTs, said the loss of life was astonishing. ""I climbed down the cargo net and just tried to grab as many people as I could,"" said Gerolstein, 93. A third LST was hit in the stern. James Brown, then 20, scrambled onto the deck. ""When I got up there, I saw two of the LSTs on fire,"" Brown, a West Virginia native, told CNN. ""That was the only light we had. I could hear the German torpedo boats buzzing near us, but I couldn't see them."" He added, ""Men were on fire jumping off our ship. To this day, I still see those men jumping with their gear on into the water."" A hospital corpsman, Brown, 91, tried to tend to the wounded. ""I put a tourniquet on the leg of a guy near me, but there wasn't much else I could do for him. The whole scene was horrific,"" said Brown. A ""typographical error in orders"" put the LSTs on a different radio frequency than their escort ship and the British naval headquarters ashore, according to MacDonald's study. The British escort ship allegedly failed to alert the U.S. ships to the German boats because its crew assumed the original notice had already been relayed. ""Whether an absence of either or both of those factors would have had any effect on the tragic events that followed would be impossible to say -- but probably not,"" MacDonald wrote. In April, autonomous underwater vehicle manufacturer Hydroid and Britain's Royal Navy Maritime Autonomous System Trials Team produced the first high-definition sonar images of the two LST wreck sites. The unmanned underwater vehicle they used is designed to perform intricate oceanographic surveys over large areas and equipped with multiple sonar instruments that capture images of the wreck sites. The company data shows that both LSTs are about 50 meters below the surface and reach 6 to 8 meters above the seafloor. ""We hope that the data collected on this mission will shed additional light on this tragic event and help bring some closure to the families who lost their loved ones during Exercise Tiger,"" said Richard ""Bungy"" Williams, regional manager of Hydroid Europe. Laurie Bolton has visited England several times with Exercise Tiger veterans. Her uncle's death remained a mystery for months after the attack. In May 1944, his family received a letter from the military saying he was missing in action, Laurie Bolton said. Three months later, another letter said he died in action. Brown said that hours after the failed exercise, he and other survivors were locked in a room and addressed by a military officer. ""The lieutenant ... tells us we cannot divulge any information about what happened or else we'll be court-martialed,"" he said. ""That scared us."" Details of the training exercise attack were kept secret until August 1944 out of fear that it would jeopardize the D-Day operation, according to military documents. Brown says he didn't speak to anyone about Exercise Tiger until 1987. ""Even years after the war was over, I felt that I was still under an obligation not to say anything,"" he said. ""When you're in the service and you're told something, you stick to it."" As a result of Exercise Tiger, the Army took note of several ""deficiencies which were rectified for the invasion."" Defective lifebelts, faulty alarm systems aboard the LSTs, and flawed lifeboat protocols were among the concerns the Army addressed for D-Day. More than 156,000 troops crossed the English Channel during the D-Day invasion approximately six weeks later. Nearly 10,000 Allied troops were killed or wounded. ""Any kind of practice has got to have some good points,"" Brown said of D-Day's deadly rehearsal. ""It sure didn't feel like it right after.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The House of Representatives on Tuesday formally admonished Republican Rep. Joe Wilson for shouting ""you lie"" during President Obama's speech to a joint session of Congress last week. Rep. Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina, shouts ""You lie!"" during President Obama's speech Wednesday night. The House passed a resolution of disapproval on a 240-179 vote that was mostly along party lines, reflecting the Democratic majority in the chamber. Twelve Democrats voted ""no,"" while seven Republicans voted for the measure. Five representatives, all Democrats, voted ""present."" According to the Office of the House Historian, it was the first time in its 220-year history that the House has disciplined a member for speaking out during a presidential speech in the chamber to a joint session of Congress. During debate on the resolution, Wilson called the measure a waste of time and failed to apologize to the chamber, as demanded by House Democrats. ""When we are done here today, we will not have taken any further steps toward helping"" the nation deal with urgent challenges, said Wilson, of South Carolina. ""It is time that we move forward and get back to work for the American people.""  Watch House members debate the resolution » . He and other Republicans noted that Wilson apologized to Obama immediately after the speech, and that the president accepted it. Asked after the vote if he apologized privately to House leaders such as Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Wilson told journalists it wasn't necessary. ""In my view, by apologizing to the president, the most important person in the history of the world, that applied to everyone,"" Wilson said. However, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said Wilson's refusal to apologize to the House for his disrespectful behavior to the chamber required admonishment. The issue, he said, ""is whether we are able to proceed with a degree of civility and decorum"" that Congress requires. The House resolution was the mildest form of discipline the chamber can exercise for misconduct on the House floor. ""Whereas the conduct of the Representative from South Carolina was a breach of decorum and degraded the proceedings of the joint session, to the discredit of the House: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the House of Representatives disapproves of the behavior of the Representative from South Carolina, Mr. Wilson, during the joint session of Congress held on Sept. 9, 2009,"" said a text of the resolution posted earlier on Hoyer's legislative Web site. Before debate on the measure began, one Democrat said the disrespect shown Obama by Wilson never would have happened to a white president. ""It only happened when this country elected a president of color,"" said Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia. Another noted the heckling of the president in the House was unprecedented, and the chamber needed to enforce discipline in order to maintain civility.  Watch Johnson comment on why he supports the resolution » . ""No president has been subjected to that type of treatment on the floor of the House of Representatives, and if we go down that road, then it's the law of the jungle, and I think that's just wrong,"" said Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia. However, House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio called the resolution ""piling on."" In the debate, Boehner and other Republicans acknowledged the mistake by Wilson while citing his military career and how his four children also served in the military. They noted that he already had apologized to Obama and accused Democrats of a partisan stunt intended to deflect attention from what they called increasingly unpopular health care legislation.  Watch Boehner talk about health care, support Wilson's apology » . ""The American people want less politics and more jobs,"" said Rep. Mike Pence, R-Indiana. In closing the debate, Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the House Majority whip, noted that all Americans, especially schoolchildren, learn about civics and government by observing the House. Clyburn, a former schoolteacher, said failing to enforce House rules against Wilson's outburst would send the wrong message. The House Democratic leadership agreed to move forward with the vote after meeting to discuss the issue Monday evening, according to two Democratic leadership aides. Kristie Greco, a spokeswoman for Clyburn, said the discussion at Monday's meeting was about ""how this speaks to the breach of decorum alone, and not addressing the issue sets a precedent for bad behavior."" ""We're not the British Parliament for a reason,"" Greco added.  Watch combative politicians in other countries » . Wilson on Sunday described his loud retort to Obama's statement that illegal immigrants would not be covered under the Democrats' health care bill as ""a town hall moment."" But he made it clear he would not apologize on the House floor. ""I called immediately, I did apologize, but I believe one apology is sufficient,"" he said. Last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the episode ""unfortunate"" and told reporters at her weekly news conference, ""It's time for us to talk about health care and not Mr. Wilson."" But when Pelosi met with Democratic leaders later that day, her colleagues argued that unless Wilson apologized on his own, they would want a formal vote on a resolution of disapproval, according to several Democratic sources. On Tuesday, Pelosi refused to comment on the resolution to reporters outside the weekly Democratic caucus meeting, saying that journalists should be focusing on the health care reform issue. Other Democrats offered their thoughts. Johnson said Wilson's comment amounted to a ""wink"" of approval to right-wing extremists who have brought highly charged language and imagery -- such as posters depicting Obama with a Hitler mustache or as an African witch doctor -- to the health care debate. ""He [Wilson] did not help the cause of diversity and tolerance with his remarks,"" Johnson said. ""If I were a betting man, I would say that it instigated more racist sentiment feeling that it's OK -- you don't have to bury it now."" Johnson added that failing to rebuke Wilson would bring increased racism in the public discussion on health care, saying: ""You can bring it out and talk about it fully, and so I guess we will probably have folks putting on white hoods and white uniforms again riding through the countryside intimidating people."" ""That's the logical conclusion if this kind of attitude is not rebuked, and Congressman Wilson represents it,"" Johnson said. ""He is the face of it, and that's why I support the resolution."" To Rep. Jason Altmire of Pennsylvania, a member of the moderate Blue Dog Democratic coalition, the issue was simple: ""He has not apologized to the House for the embarrassment he brought"" to the chamber, Altmire said. Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee of California, a leading member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said Wilson's violation of House rules was ""egregious enough that it warrants an apology on the floor."" Without that, the resolution of disapproval is called for, she said. On the Republican side, Rep. Steve King of Iowa began circulating a letter among House Republicans last weekend urging Wilson not to apologize on the House floor. The letter stated, ""We urge that you hold your ground against those who seek partisan advantage and reject all demands for additional redress. When the president of the United States accepts an apology, no observer has an additional claim.""

"(CNN) -- A journalist who has criticized NBC's coverage of the London Olympics has been suspended from Twitter after using the site to publish a network executive's private e-mail address and urge followers to message him. Guy Adams, the Los Angeles correspondent for London's Independent newspaper, said he was tossed from the site Sunday after a series of posts, beginning Friday, that were critical of NBC's decision to delay airing the Games' Opening Ceremony and other events. ""The man responsible for NBC pretending the Olympics haven't started yet is Gary Zenkel,"" read one post from Friday referring to the network, which has exclusive broadcast rights to the London Olympics in the United States. ""Tell him what u think!"" That post then listed Zenkel's e-mail address. Adams didn't notice any repercussions until he checked his account Sunday, he said. ""When I logged on, I was presented with a message saying it had been 'suspended,' "" Adams wrote in a post for the Independent. ""If I had any questions, I was asked to click on a link and fill in an online form. ""[Monday] morning, I heard back from Twitter. In what was apparently an automated e-mail, I was told that: 'Your Twitter account has been suspended for posting an individual's private information such as private e-mail address.' It then contained a copy of my tweet regarding Mr. Zenkel."" Twitter spokeswoman Rachael Horowitz said the company doesn't ""comment on individual users for privacy reasons."" Twitter's terms of use forbid posting other people's personal information. The site says it doesn't monitor tweets but investigates if a user complains that they've been affected. NBC Sports has confirmed that it complained about the post. ""We filed a complaint with Twitter because a user tweeted the personal information of one of our executives,"" the company said in a written statement. ""According to Twitter, this is a violation of their privacy policy. Twitter alone levies discipline."" Opinion: Is it really #NBCfail? Twitter does say that posting information that's already been published online doesn't violate its terms. Some people critical of the move say that should have saved Adams, because a Web search for Zenkel's e-mail address will turn it up. As Mashable's Chris Taylor writes, however, it's not easily found, and it is featured most prominently on an anti-NBC petition. Twitter and NBC Universal have a partnership during the Olympics through which the social media service is collecting tweets from athletes and fans and displaying them all on one page. Adams has used Twitter and his articles to fire withering criticism at NBC over how it has handled Olympic coverage. In tweets that have since been deleted, he accused NBC of ""disgusting money grabbing"" and called the company ""utter, utter bastards."" Live or later: What's your ideal Olympics coverage? Many users have taken to Twitter to speak against his suspension, saying it appears linked to his critiques. ""The Guy Adams Twitter ban illustrates three tendencies of hegemonic power; 1) hates criticism, 2) takes itself seriously 3) no sense of fun,"" posted Scottish novelist Irvine Welsh, the author of ""Trainspotting."" Others, though, noted that the posting of Zenkel's e-mail makes it a somewhat murkier question. ""If criticizing NBC over how it's handled the Olympic coverage were cause for suspension Twitter would pretty much be empty right about now,"" wrote tech industry analyst Michael Gartenberg.","Critic of NBC's Olympic coverage is suspended from Twitter .

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Israel of Germany's ""Holocaust shame,"" and asserted its support for the Jewish state during an unprecedented speech to the Knesset on Tuesday. Germany and Israel are linked ""in a very special way"" by the memory of the Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews were killed under Nazi Germany and its allies in World War II, she said in the first address a German chancellor has ever made to the Knesset. ""The Holocaust fills us with shame,"" she said. ""I bow my head before the survivors and I bow my head before you in tribute to the fact that you were able to survive."" Anti-Semitism, racism and xenophobia ""must never take root again in Germany or in Europe,"" she said, and vowed to battle any flare-ups. Speaking to the Knesset, Angela Merkel also spoke of Germany's unwavering support for Israel calling the Iranian president's nuclear ambitions ""a major danger"" not only to Israel, but to the world as well. The German Chancellor called on him to prove that he does not want a nuclear bomb. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said his country's nuclear program is intended for peaceful purposes only, but Merkel told the Israeli parliament that he needs to provide clear evidence supporting that assertion. ""It is not the world that has to prove that Iran is building a bomb,"" she said. ""Rather, Iran has to prove to the world that it does not want the nuclear bomb."" Ahmadinejad has also said Israel should not exist as a sovereign nation, but Merkel said Israel's right to exist is not open to negotiation. ""These are not just empty words,"" she said, adding that Germany would support further sanctions on Iran if it fails to cooperate. ""What do we do when a majority says the greatest threat to the world comes from Israel and not from Iran?"" she asked. ""Do we bow our heads? Do we give up our efforts to combat the Iranian threat? However inconvenient and uncomfortable the alternative is, we do not do that."" ""If we were to do that, then we would not have understood our historical responsibility, nor would we be able to properly develop a way to deal with the challenges of our day, and both options would be lethal."" Watch German Chancellor Angela Merkel address the Knesset » . Merkel said she supports the two-state solution to the Mideast conflict, discussed last November by the key parties in Annapolis, Maryland. It calls for Israelis and Palestinians to live side by side in separate states. She called rocket attacks by Palestinians into Israel ""a crime,"" and said they do nothing to solve the conflict. But she noted that effecting a two-state solution would require ""strength to make painful compromises.""

"(Mashable) -- Twitter ran on Sunday its first-ever TV spot during the broadcast of the 2012 Pocono 400 NASCAR race. Omid Ashtari of Twitter sent a tweet informing the community to check out the social networking site's first commercial spot. The 16-second clip features NASCAR racer Brad Keselowski seated in his car and taking a picture of the scene with his iPhone. Keselowski, who came in 24th place during the race, is taking advantage of the iPhone's capability to upload pictures directly to Twitter. He is an active user of the site. Keselowski made headlines in February when he tweeted updates and pictures following an explosion and fire on a NASCAR track that delayed the Daytona 500. His documentation of the event earned him more than 100,000 followers in under two hours. Mashable: NASCAR Driver Tweets From Car, Gains More Than 100,000 Followers in Two Hours . What's especially interesting about the TV commercial is how Twitter plugged the NASCAR hashtag at the end of the TV spot.

"(CNN) -- Obsession often brings joy and sorrow in equal measure. Inside that thin, shiny packet giving off a mystical glow sits five stickers -- five faces of five men whose very presence can turn lives upside down. Welcome to the world of World Cup sticker collecting. ""My girlfriend gave me an ultimatum the other day, her or the football stickers? Shame really, I thought she was the one,"" Daniel Blazer, a British collector, told CNN. While most relationships survive the sticker phase, Blazer is not alone in his infatuation with the shiny adhesives which smile back at those dreaming of the holy grail -- the full sticker album. Some are relentless in their pursuit of that holy grail, setting up spreadsheets and even calling in their spouse to increase the odds of successful swapping. ""My husband, Stephen, is obsessed with his sticker album,"" Emma Conway, who blogs under the name of brummymummyof2, told CNN. ""He has his own spreadsheet so he knows what he needs and what he doesn't. It does get annoying. ""Every time I go near a shop I have to get my three-year-old daughter some stickers and then get some for my 31-year-old husband. ""He's a fantastic dad to our two children but I think the opportunity to collect stickers reminds him and his friends of being kids. ""When I go to work, he gives me his swaps, and I swap them with my colleagues and then bring them back. ""I'm like a drug dealer...but with stickers."" Panini, the Italian company which creates the stickers, has been producing the iconic adhesives for the world's biggest football tournament since 1970. Based in Modena, but with subsidiaries across the globe, Panini can produce over 25 million packets of stickers a day -- that's over 750 million individual stickers. The company, which has a partnership with FIFA, the world's governing body, has exclusive rights to create products for the tournament. Sold in 100 countries worldwide, the phenomenon has become synonymous with the World Cup, which is held every four years. ""I was very addicted when I was younger,"" Gabriel Perlaza, from Austin, Texas, told CNN, of his sticker obsession. ""All we would do in recess was trade stickers. I'd also go downtown to the street vendors with my father or grandfather. They had drawers full of stickers and would sell them for different prices individually. ""Looking back, it's just crazy how stickers would just take over and be all that mattered for those couple of months leading up to the World Cup. ""Even now, at the age of 32, when I stop by the store and buy five packets, I can't wait to get home and open them up,"" added Perlaza. A quick glance at Twitter, Gumtree and other social media sites, provides a glimpse into the level of addiction that is currently gripping the world. The hashtag #gotgotneed -- named after the phrase ""got, got need"" -- is usually uttered during a sticker swapping session and it's now one of the most prevalent on Twitter. Be it on street corners or pubs and cafes, collectors trade at every opportunity, holding swapping sessions and allowing doubles to be discarded for the stickers which have so far proved elusive. ""I'm not at peace with myself if I can't get my hands on a Panini album before the World Cup,"" said Bernt-Erik Haaland, who lives in Norway. ""It's a really important part of the whole experience, especially the 'getting ready' and build up part to the tournament. ""It's also a really sociable thing to do because you can swap stickers with your friends."" The internet has provided a whole new dimension to the World Cup sticker craze. Stickermanager.com is just one website which collectors can turn to in an effort to find each and every one of the 640 stickers. Created for the 2006 World Cup in Germany, it now boasts 140,000 registered members who swap stickers online with fellow collectors around the world. But swapping stickers in the post can be treacherous -- corners can get folded, faces can be blemished and your reputation can be ruined. Even within the safety of the home, keeping stickers in perfect condition can be hazardous. ""We have a three-year-old girl and a one-year-old boy at home,"" Conway said. ""My daughter loves the stickers and is always trying to peel them out of the book. ""My husband is a very mild mannered man but if the kids go near the stickers then he'll raise his voice. He's very protective."" Keeping your stickers in mint condition is crucial in maximizing your ability to swap. According to Stickermanager, the most popular sticker people are looking to collect is Jordi Alba, the Spain and Barcelona defender along with the German national logo in all its shiny glory. But forget about swapping Gianluigi Buffon -- everybody appears to have the Juventus and Italian goalkeeper in their collection. Every collector has a nemesis -- just ask Phil Smith, an avid collector from Sunderland. He is starting to feel he is being stalked by Cameroon's Alex Song. ""Song has swiftly become the scourge of my existence,"" said Smith. ""Collecting stickers was an attempt to try and reconnect with my childhood and an innocent love of the game. ""Alex has totally sucked the whole fun out of the whole process, though. I have five of him now, and there appears to be no end in sight . ""The prospect of swapping him for someone exotic or essential to my collection is long gone. His five faces are destined to sit on top of my record player for eternity, symbolically gathering dust. ""For many, 2014 will be the summer of Samba, football, flair and joy. For me, it will be the summer of Alex Song."" One man took his love for stickers to a whole new level. Adam Caroll-Smith, a Portsmouth fan, stumbled upon his 1996 Premier League sticker album in 2012 and was left devastated to find he was still missing six players. The 29-year-old, who chronicles his quest to complete his collection in his book, ""Six Stickers: A journey to complete an old sticker album"", traveled far and wide to meet the players who he had failed to find in those hundreds of packets. His journey proved successful, meeting the six former Premier League footballers and completing the book, before tossing the album into the sea in an act he describes as ""cathartic."" ""At the time, I was coming up to 30, getting married, having a child and it felt like a natural point to take stock of my life,"" Carroll-Smith told CNN. ""I think for a lot of people, that plays a part in the obsession. It allows them the opportunity to wallow in the excitement of their childhood. ""I think stickers are a metaphor for that -- they are something with a beautiful simplicity. ""When you're a kid, it's a chance to flash your football allegiance and gives you tangible proof to show how into football you are. ""Now, it gives a bizarre and nostalgic feel. I guess it's because it's something rooted in a particular era and has a timeless quality about it."" Such is the universal appeal of the product that Panini says in total it will sell 239,000 km of stickers - enough to stretch into space. ""Panini has the ability to create nostalgia galore amongst our 'second generation' collectors,"" Jessica Tadmor, head of marketing at Panini UK, told CNN. ""The media plays a large part. We've had radio DJ's collecting live on air, TV programs featuring the collection, and Twitter going sticker crazy. ""There have even been secret midnight swapping conventions in London aided by a beer or two."" Even the players are at it -- Costa Rica striker Joel Campbell, who was so desperate to find a sticker of himself that he bought a hundred packets. But after opening each packet, he was left seething after failing to collect his own picture -- unlike his Costa Rica teammate, Bryan Ruiz. The craze is set to continue when the tournament kicks off in Sao Paulo on June 12 with Brazil hosting Croatia in the opening fixture. Conway is already resigned to losing the attention of her husband, Stephen, for the duration of the tournament -- even if he's finished his sticker album by then. ""I won't exist once it all starts,"" she jokes. ""We've been together 10 years so I know exactly what to expect and I'm sure he'll try to get the kids watching with him. ""His brother is going to Brazil so he's got a bit of envy but he'll be watching all the games. ""And he'll be making sure the kids don't go anywhere near the stickers too!""","Panini World Cup stickers have taken the football world by storm .

"(CNN) -- Online social networking site Twitter said Thursday it will begin deleting users' tweets in countries that require it -- but it will still keep those deleted tweets visible to the rest of the world. The move is significant because, until now, the only way Twitter could comply with countries' limits was to remove the content globally. Twitter said it will now delete tweets only ""reactively"" and on a case-by-case basis and will let the affected user know why the content is being withheld. ""We hold freedom of expression in high esteem and work hard not to remove Tweets,"" Twitter spokeswoman Jodi Olson wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""And just to be clear, this is not a change in philosophy and there are still countries to which we will not go,"" she said. As examples of countries where tweets may have to be restricted, Twitter mentioned Germany and France, which ban pro-Nazi content. Twitter will operate in those countries while censoring pro-Nazi tweets, for example. But some countries are so restrictive with freedom of expression that Twitter can't exist there at all, the company said. ""One of our core values as a company is to defend and respect each user's voice,"" Twitter wrote in a blog entry Thursday. ""We try to keep content up wherever and whenever we can, and we will be transparent with users when we can't. The Tweets must continue to flow."" But one observer said the move is blatant censorship. ""There's no way around that. But alas, Twitter is not above the law,"" according to Jillian York, the director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which defends free speech and privacy online. York said she acknowledges that Twitter, like other companies hosting user-generated content, has at some point faced a government order or request to take down content. ""Twitter has two options in the event of a request: fail to comply, and risk being blocked by the government in question, or comply (read: censor). And if they have 'boots on the ground,' so to speak, in the country in question? No choice,"" she wrote. The company is simply ""doing its best in a tough situation,"" she said. CNN's Augie Martin contributed to this report.","Twitter says the move will be on a case-by-case basis .

"(CNN) -- Just how big is mobile game phenomenon ""Angry Birds""? Players have slingshotted more than 100 billion virtual birds in the game's many versions, more birds than actually exist on the planet. That's according to Peter Vesterbacka, chief of Rovio, the Finnish developer behind the blockbuster game. Speaking on a panel Thursday at Fortune's Brainstorm Tech conference, Vesterbacka said the game has surpassed 300 million downloads and has set its sights on becoming the first entertainment franchise with 1 billion fans worldwide. To reach that goal, the game's makers are expanding way beyond their pig-pulverizing core product, which has been a top app for iPhones, iPads and Android devices for more than a year. ""Angry Birds"" toys and stuffed birds have been hot sellers, and a board game hit stores this spring. Also in the works are an animated series, a possible feature film and even a series of books, including a cookbook of egg recipes. ""We've been told time after time that we're not supposed to do movies, TV and toys,"" said Vesterbacka, wearing his now-trademark red sweatshirt with an ""Angry Birds"" design on the front. ""We've sold something like 8 million toys. If you have a strong brand, you can do anything."" Players of ""Angry Birds"" seek to advance to new levels of the game by sending birds crashing into fortresses built by their nemeses: pigs who have stolen the birds' eggs.

"(CNN) -- Twitter users are rightly aghast that the company on Sunday banned a user for openly criticizing NBC's coverage of the Olympics. After Guy Adams, a British newspaper reporter for The Independent, posted negative comments about NBC's tape-delayed Olympics coverage (including one executive's work e-mail for viewers to make complaints), Twitter alerted its business partner -- NBC -- and showed the network how to file a complaint capable of shutting down the offending user. Both Twitter and NBC apologized Tuesday, and Twitter restored Adams' account. Yes, the Twitterverse should be appalled, but we should not be surprised. First off, Twitter is a private, for-profit company. Having provided a free service to millions of Internet users for years, the company is attempting to placate and even pay back investors who have been awaiting returns on millions of venture dollars. This means becoming more restrictive, more top-down and more corporate. Last month, in an effort to raise advertising revenue, the company announced it was closing its API (application program interface) to third-party apps -- meaning people and companies can no longer make applications that stream Twitter data. This makes it harder to see Tweets from places other than Twitter's own website. It's an entirely less open service this way, but it also gives Twitter exclusive control over how and where people access its content -- and advertisements. And now, as if to prove that it's more of a corporate player than a tool for corporate critique and other radical activity, Twitter has given its biggest partners a primer in how to ban users that offend them: Simply ask us. Tech: Welcome to the Twitter Olympics . So is the Net suddenly less free and open? No. The Net -- at least as a technology -- is just as free as it was before. This is simply what happens when we rely on a highly centralized and privately owned tool for a capability that might best be accomplished through a more distributed technology. The Net might be a big decentralized network, but Twitter is a single, centralized node on that network. Our tweets don't self-replicate and spread; they go to Twitter, which then essentially broadcasts them to our followers. This is an efficient system, for sure, but it is also highly controllable. The extent to which our messages proliferate depends entirely on the kindness of Twitter, a company that has priorities other than us. The alternative would be to sidestep Twitter altogether, and re-create its functionality through less restrictive, distributed tools. We could use the messaging equivalent of Napster or Tor -- the peer-to-peer networks that let people share music and movies with each other. Instead of downloading files from a central server, people get bits and pieces of files from one another. Likewise, e-mail travels sideways from server to server, in bits and pieces, with no truly central administrator motivated to ban a particular user for what he's writing. We may not like Twitter for what it's doing, but it's not up to a multimillion-dollar corporation to act against its own short-term financial interests in favor of freedom of our speech. Tech: Meet the man who started #NBCFail . It is, however, up to those of us who want a free and open Internet to make the effort to understand how our technologies work and who controls them. Only then will we be capable of exploring alternatives to centralized corporate software, and of building and supporting them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Douglas Rushkoff: Twitter users appalled by ban of reporter's access after anti-NBC tweets .
Rushkoff: It's no surprise -- Twitter a corporation with concerns besides users .
He says it sends message to corporate partners: Ask us how to ban users that offend .
Rushkoff: Users who don't want to depend on Twitter should explore and/or build alternatives ."
"(CNN) -- At first blush, it sounds like a torturous way to read an 8,500-word short story. But in a nod to the social media age, The New Yorker is offering up new fiction on Twitter in a series of 140-character bursts. ""Black Box,"" a new story by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jennifer Egan, was to begin appearing on the New Yorker Fiction Twitter account Thursday at 8 p.m. ET. A single line will be published every minute for the next hour, then from 8-9 p.m. on each of the following nine nights, through June 2. While waiting for new snippets might not sound like the most fun way to consume a story, lovers of the written word can take some solace in the fact that Egan, no stranger to nontraditional storytelling, wrote ""Black Box"" with Twitter in mind. Egan's 2010 novel, ""A Visit From the Goon Squad,"" won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the National Book Critics Circle Award. ""Black Box,"" she says, takes a character from that book and tells a ""spy-thriller"" version of her tale. ""This is not a new idea, of course, but it's a rich one -- because of the intimacy of reaching people through their phones, and because of the odd poetry that can happen in 140 characters,"" she said in a New Yorker post about the experiment. ""I found myself imagining a series of terse mental dispatches from a female spy of the future, working undercover by the Mediterranean Sea. I wrote these bulletins by hand in a Japanese notebook that had eight rectangles on each page."" Egan said the story was originally twice its present length and that she spent about a year writing and revising it -- using Twitter's character-counting tool to make sure the final lines would make the cut. As Egan's statement suggests, she's not the first to tackle fiction on Twitter and other digital short forms. In Japan, ""keitai shousetsu,"" or ""cellphone novels"" written in the form of text messages, have become perennial best-sellers since originating in the early 2000s. In 2008, Penguin Books launched the ""We Tell Stories"" project in which six of its authors used interactive media, including Twitter, to tell new tales. (One, Toby Litt's ""Slice,"" was told as a series of blog posts and tweets from the story's main character and her parents). And in 2009, author and noted Twitter-phile Neil Gaiman worked with BBC Audiobooks on an interactive novel built from tweets. Egan is no stranger to nontraditional approaches to writing herself. ""Goon Squad"" hovers somewhere between being a novel and a series of related short stories about an aging music-industry executive and other rock 'n' roll characters. In it, one chapter appears as a PowerPoint presentation. In July, The Guardian printed Egan's ""To Do,"" a short story told as a seemingly innocuous list of chores. Call ""Black Box"" gimmicky if you like, but you can't claim it's just Egan wanting to screw around on Twitter. She has an account, but before two tweets promoting Thursday's serialization, she'd only posted four times since signing up in 2010. And fear not if you can't stand the thought of reading a story tucked into your Twitter feed (of, for that matter, if you can't stand the thought of Twitter). The New Yorker will be publishing a daily summary of the story-so-far on its Page Turner fiction blog. The story also will appear in its entirety in the venerable magazine's upcoming science-fiction issue.","The New Yorker was to begin posting a short story tweet by tweet on Twitter Thursday night .

"(CNN) -- Apple released Mountain Lion to developers last week, a new operating system that will make your desktop computer work more like your phone than ever before. The trend is clear: The desktop operating system will merge with the mobile OS in the coming years. The question is: Why? Let's start with the trend itself. First off, Apple is integrating cloud services much more deeply in Mountain Lion than any previous operating system. That means your music, photos, calendars, contacts, emails and more can now stay in sync across your phone, tablet and Mac. Apple has also unified your messages across your devices: The Message app (formerly iMessages) will replace iChat on the Mac. That's not all: Mountain Lion also gets a notification center that works just like the notifications you receive on your phone. Games Center is coming to the Mac as well, allowing you to play games against your friends who own iPhones and iPads. Apps like Reminders, Notes and Contacts are also all getting desktop versions -- and of course these sync with your mobile devices so your data is always up to date. Most notable of all: Apple is now pushing software updates through the Mac App Store, hinting that the App Store may become the only way to get software on your Mac in the future. So what are the advantages of your desktop computer merging with your phone's functionality? And are there any downsides? Simplicity . The main reason Apple wants to make Macs work like the iPhone and iPad is simple. Or rather, simplicity. Despite decades of innovation and the invention of the graphical user interface, computers remain too confusing and complex for the majority of people. While more powerful software with complex functionality will continue to exist for highly technical users, most consumers want a device that's easy to use and intuitive. The rise of the iPad and iPhone prove that there's huge demand for such simplicity, and that desktops too will need to become more streamlined. The downside of simplicity? Simple systems are often less ""open"" and provide less freedom to try new things: Tasks are either easy to complete (because the developers thought of that use case) or not possible at all. Security . Mobile operating systems could potentially be more secure than their desktop counterparts. In particular, if Apple makes the App Store the only way to download apps to your Mac, it would become more difficult for users to install malware (since Apple manually approves every app in the store). What's more, mobile features like tracking the location of your devices or wiping them remotely will make consumer desktops more secure. There are downsides to app stores, however. Not only would devices become less open -- the makers of operating systems become gatekeepers -- but you could argue that Apple and its rivals simply want to force the use of app stores so that they make more money for themselves. Syncing . Perhaps the most obvious benefit of making desktops work more like phones is unity between all your devices. With a similar (or single) operating system on all your gadgets, syncing apps, contacts and calendars between them all becomes effortless. There's a downside for users, however: Competing operating systems tend not to work well together, and using one operating system across all devices means uses are ""locked in"" more than ever before. So there you have it: Your desktop computer is becoming more and more like your phone -- and in fact the line between the two will one day disappear. If you think it's just Apple's devices that are headed toward a simpler operating system, however, you'd be mistaken -- Apple is merely in the news because Mountain Lion became available to developers last week. In fact, Microsoft's Windows 8 takes its cues from Windows Phone, meaning that the two major desktop operating systems will mimic your mobile devices very soon.","Desktop operating systems will merge with mobile OS in the coming years .

"(Wired) -- Google's Android platform has been growing steadily since its release in 2008. Now, one out of every three U.S. smartphone owners is using an Android-based device, according to a recent report. So why aren't developers more excited about the platform? Of the 69.5 million Americans who owned smartphones as of the end of February, 33 percent used Android devices, according to a report from ComScore. It's a leap of 7 points in a period of only three months. The growth of Apple's iOS remained stagnant, seeing only a 0.2 percent increase over the same period of time. Competitors Microsoft, HP and RIM were the ones who suffered as Android grew, with drops of 1.3 percent, 1.1 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively. The five companies' smartphone market share is shown in the table below. The growth is partly a numbers game. One of Google's advantages is the sheer number of phone models running Android. Hardware makers have announced more than 10 different Android devices in the first three months of this year, far more than those running Google's competitors. By contrast, HP announced two new phones in February (the first mobile phone hardware release from the company in far too long), only one Windows Phone 7 device has appeared in 2011, and we're probably not going to see the iPhone 5 anytime soon. For all of Android's success, however, the platform has yet to fully satisfy its application developer base. Baird Research shared the results of a recent developer survey with Wired.com, showing that more than 50 percent of developers questioned ""view fragmentation"" --  the disparity in software versions across device manufacturers and handsets -- to be a ""meaningful or serious"" problem. Developers also expressed concern over the fragmentation of the app ecosystem on Android, saying they generally preferred a ""unified, single-store experience like Apple's App store."" For customers who enjoy Android's openness, the lack of a single app store is hardly a problem. Those who wish to go outside the walled garden of Apple's iOS (but don't necessarily want to jailbreak their phones) can do so fairly easily on an Android device -- or they can use alternative app stores, like Amazon's. But for developers who wants their programs to make serious money, a nonunified app ecosystem may be less than desirable. Fully 74 percent of respondents said developing for Apple's iOS gave the best opportunities for paid-app revenues, and twice as many developers claimed their apps were more visible in Apple's app store than they were in the Android Market. We may see a shift in developer attitudes as Android continues to mature and further improve its app ecosystem. Google launched the Android Market web store in February, and just last week it officially enabled in-app billing, allowing developers to charge customers for items purchased within an application. In addition, a several developers have made six-figure revenues from Android apps, with a couple scoring million-dollar paydays. With the promise of big money, and a huge base of customers to target, developers have a strong incentive to continue coding for Android. Indeed, despite the complaints, 71 percent of respondents said that they have developed apps for the platform. Whether they're currently satisfied with Google's OS or not, it looks like developers will continue writing code for it. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

"(CNN) -- With the launch of an App Store for the Mac last week, Apple has proved that its all-in-one digital marketplace model -- so successful for the iPhone, iPod and iPad -- can flourish on old-fashioned laptop and desktop computers as well. Developers with software ready for the store's January 6 opening were met with throngs of click-happy customers. Mac users have appeared eager to spend money on apps, even for software that was previously available on the Web and in brick-and-mortar stores. Downloads on the first day exceeded 1 million -- out of a pool of about 1,000 apps, Apple said. Distributed evenly, that works out to 1,000 downloads for each app, although name recognition and how Apple allocates promotion tend to skew results. But some development houses did gangbuster business. Scott Forstall, Apple's vice president for iPhone software, said last year that the company's iPad would spark ""a whole new gold rush for app developers,"" a prediction that must now apply to the Mac store as well. App Store winners . One big winner from the Mac App Store launch has been Evernote. The free note-taking app catalogs text and multimedia files; synchronizes them over the internet to be accessed from phones, a website or desktop software; and lets you search through them. Evernote was downloaded 90,000 times on the App Store's opening day. That's about a 10th of all apps purchased that day. It's been consistently listed in the section of most popular apps. ""Having a well-formed app store is the most important part in getting attention,"" Evernote CEO Phil Libin said. ""We were on the iPhone App Store since that launched as well. We've kind of been through this once before, so we had pretty high expectations of what being in an app store means for getting attention."" The Mac App Store launch, Libin said, ""exceeded our expectations."" Being in the Mac App Store helped expose Evernote to 40,000 people who had never used it, he said. Evernote has also benefited from Apple's promotional efforts in the store. It sometimes gets top billing in a rotating list of featured apps, similar to the top section of the iTunes Store. Apple spokeswoman Jacqueline Roy also listed Evernote among the top five ""must-have"" apps, which is determined by consistent top performers in downloads and ratings. Another Mac App Store hit is SketchBook Express, No. 7 on the must-have list. Autodesk, the maker of that free drawing program, says the store ""effectively doubled"" the number of people using the professional version of SketchBook on opening day. The company declined to provide exact figures. SketchBook Pro costs $30 on the Mac App Store, versus almost $70 on Amazon.com. It's now among Apple's highest-grossing apps. A lucrative business model . Apple takes a 30% cut of app sales, which makes its app stores a lucrative business for the company as well as developers. Because of this success, the stores are facing increased competition from Google's popular Android Market, a forthcoming Amazon.com app store and other rivals. This week, Microsoft contested Apple's trademark request for the term ""app store."" Free applications benefit from the app store exposure too, even though they don't help Apple's business as directly. For example, Twitter is also on the Apple must-have list. The social networking company launched on the store with its first official desktop client, based on work by the engineer who made the iPhone app. A Twitter spokeswoman said the company is ""pleased"" with the results but declined to say how many times the free app had been downloaded. The App Store program is included as part of a software update for Mac computers running the newest version of the operating system, called Snow Leopard. Further enhancements to the app model will come as part of OS X Lion, which is scheduled to go on sale this summer. Previously, Mac software could be found on vendors' websites or in stores (in cardboard boxes, no less; how quaint). For developers, submitting an application to Apple for sale in the Mac App Store can be easier than getting their software on a retailer's shelf, which can require complex business deals. It is also easier to sell through an established app store than through a developer's own website, which can require building payment mechanisms and systems for licensing customers' copies. Mac owners like the store because it makes software easier to find, manages what's been downloaded, makes it easy to move apps between computers and provides alerts when a new version is available. Some software makers complain that Apple's rules about what it will accept are too stringent and that the company takes too big a cut of revenue. But Apple doesn't bar developers from distributing their wares in other locations on the Web. Pros and cons . But are these early success stories sustainable? Caffeine, a simple utility that helps prevent the computer from automatically going into sleep mode (get it?), did exceedingly well early on. The app has been downloaded more than 135,000 times. About one-third of those sales came on launch day; as for other apps, they have tapered somewhat since. While daily downloads are decreasing steadily for Caffeine at a pace of about 30% per day, the app continues to attract new customers at a rate several times greater than anytime since it came out four years ago. ""The App Store opens up the opportunity to sell 99-cent apps, which was previously not really feasible, and I think that could bring a lot of new smaller apps,"" Caffeine developer Tomas Franzen said. ""It's a lot easier when they handle hosting and payment for you. ""I'd say I'm a believer"" in the app-store model, he wrote. ""The App Store makes downloaded software easy for regular people, and it turns out there are a lot of regular people out there!"" However, not every company has the Midas touch for launching app stores. Google, which produced a hit with its Android Market, has drummed up minimal interest in its Chrome Web Store. Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales isn't sold on the app-store concept. At an event in England, Wales spoke out against the idea of app stores, calling them ""a threat to a diverse and open ecosystem,"" according to blog reports. A magic formula? But many developers seem convinced that Apple has hit on the right formula. Scott Gilbert had been planning to build a weather-report app for the iPad or iPhone. The product manager for Swackett immediately changed course when he heard Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveil plans for the Mac App Store in October. ""There's so much competition in the regular App Store,"" Gilbert said of Apple's mobile software store and its 300,000 apps. ""I thought if we could be there on day one in the Mac App Store, we could rise above the noise."" And they did. Swackett was on track to get 100,000 downloads in its first week. The developers are making money from ads, which had been shown 2 million times in six days. ""We would not have come out with a Mac app first if not for the (Mac) App Store,"" Gilbert said. And for the 61-person team at Evernote, the App Store is something of a blessing. ""We don't have experts here that think about logistics or channels or distribution or advertising,"" said Libin, the Evernote CEO. Evernote had the distribution method in place on its site, but that was created out of necessity, said Libin, who was happy to let Apple take the reins on managing server infrastructure and promotion. ""Before, you used to make a great product, but no one would ever get it or use it or be able to buy it,"" he said. ""The app stores have made the software business more of a meritocracy than it's ever been, which really favors geeks like us.""","Apple launched the Mac App Store a week ago, spawning success stories .

"(Wired) -- Facebook's iPad app could be a lot closer to launch than we thought. A full-sized, fully-functional version of the iPad app is hidden inside the current iPhone app. That means that, if you are running the iPhone app you already have the iPad executable on your phone. Discovered by M.G Siegler, Apple writer for AOL's Tech Crunch, the iPad app is a lot more modern-looking than the tired old iPhone version, and looks a lot like Twitter's official iPad app. On the left is a source list to navigate between your Wall, info, photos and friends sections. Up top, below the status bar, you'll find more icons to take you to different sections (places and chat, amongst others), and if you flip to horizontal orientation you get a combination of both these navigation ""aids,"" and the top-bar nav icons remain. In short, Facebook has managed to fully port the signature confusion of its website to a tablet app, a not insignificant achievement. Siegler, who found the app after reading about it on Twitter, calls the app ""spectacular."" The discovery was made by a an engineering student named Marvin Bernal, who also gives instructions on how to get it running on your own iPad. If you are smart enough to know what that means, and yet you still use Facebook, then go ahead and hack away.

"(CNN) -- It's a good thing that Barack Obama is only the president of the United States and leader of the free world, and that he doesn't have a really important job like television sportscaster. Because in that other role, as we learned a few months ago, a man is simply not allowed to publicly compliment a woman on her good looks without getting in big trouble. Just ask Brent Musburger. In January, after the BCS National Championship game, the ESPN commentator came under fire in the media and blogosphere. At issue: off-handed comments that Musburger made about University of Alabama quarterback A.J. McCarron's girlfriend, Katherine Webb. ESPN issued an apology, saying that the 73-year-old veteran sportscaster ""went too far"" in his commentary. In an interview with the New York Times, Michigan State University journalism professor Sue Carter called what Musburger said ""extraordinarily inappropriate."" On the sports news website, BleacherReport.com, Jessica Isner suggested that his remarks were, at the least, ""weird and creepy."" It went on and on. Opinion: Give Brent Musburger a break . So what did Musburger say back then that was so terrible? As the camera focused on Webb, a former Miss Alabama, in the stands, the sportscaster turned to his co-announcer Kirk Herbstreit, a former quarterback at Ohio State University, and said: ""You quarterbacks, you get all the good-looking women. What a beautiful woman."" The cad. Was this an overreaction? And did Musburger get a bum rap? Yes, and yes. But not many people said so at the time. Instead, the dominant narrative was that a public figure had succumbed to voyeurism and was essentially ""hitting on"" this young woman. Opinion: Obama comment sexist? I call it a compliment . By contrast, Obama isn't catching much criticism for a similar comment that he made Thursday during a swing through California. The wince-inducing remark may have been nothing more than innocent banter between old friends, as Obama supporters claimed. But it is also undeniably sexist. How do we know? Because the comment objectifies a professional woman, and it is not something that you're likely to hear said about a man with the same credentials. It all happened at a fundraising lunch Thursday in Atherton, California, as Obama was rattling off the qualities of California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who is often mentioned as a likely future gubernatorial candidate. Those of us who live in California already know that Harris is smart, tough and likable. Now, thanks to Obama, we know something else. ""She's brilliant and she's dedicated, she's tough,"" Obama said in describing our state's chief law enforcement officer. ""She also happens to be, by far, the best-looking attorney general in the country."" Obama's 'best-looking' quip: Appropriate in the real world? The fact that the crowd responded with a mixture of chuckles and groans must have signaled to the president that he had stepped in it. ""It's true,"" he told the crowd. ""Come on."" No, Mr. President, you come on. This is how you talk about a colleague, a fellow elected official, a fellow lawyer with the goods to compete head to head with any man in the country? All this talk about how Barack Obama is a different type of leader for a new century, one unencumbered by the prejudices and stereotypes that plagued earlier generations and one who symbolizes how far we've come. And this is what we get? ""The West Wing"" meets ""Mad Men."" So, when a reporter for the Fresno Bee asked Patty Bellasalma, president of the California chapter of National Organization for Women, about the president's comments, she couldn't hide her disgust. Not for the president. But for the reporter. ""I wish (this call) was about something substantive,"" Bellasalma told the journalist. ""I think that is my reaction, is that that seems to be the only time that the California National Organization for Women gets called isn't when full-scope pregnancy coverage is being cut from the budget or something other that's going to impact women in a detrimental way right here in this city in the state government. But we worry about whether the president thinks Kamala Harris is pretty. I guess my comment is no comment, because we're too busy trying to protect women and girls."" Oh, brother. Talk about an overreaction. On Friday, according to White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, Obama called Harris to apologize -- not for his comments, but for the ""distraction"" they created. The president, Carney said, did not want ""in any way to diminish the attorney general's profession, accomplishments and her capabilities."" He added that Obama ""fully recognizes the challenges women continue to face in the workplace and that they should not be judged based on appearance."" Harris' communications director, Gil Duran, said in a statement that the attorney general and Obama ""have been friends for many years. They had a great conversation yesterday and she strongly supports him."" Those are nice statements. But they don't end the controversy. The issue isn't just what Obama said but how folks are reacting to what he said. There is only one reason the president is skating on these remarks. It's because the people who normally complain about this stuff -- the folks who make up the grievance lobby -- are among his strongest supporters. This is an example of selective outrage and double standards. That part of the story isn't pretty. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","President Obama referred to Kamala Harris as the best-looking attorney general .

"(CNN) -- Caroline Wozniacki doesn't like losing -- and it's a trait that the tennis star's nearest and dearest also possess. Born into a sports-mad family, the Danish star had to battle for supremacy within the competitive environment of her childhood home in Odense, long before she had designs of making tennis her career. Both her father Piotr and older brother Patrik were professional footballers. Mother Anna played volleyball for Poland, where both parents were born -- and lived until Piotr joined a Danish club. ""Sport was in my genes,"" Wozniacki told CNN's Open Court program. ""But nobody would play me because they said I wasn't good enough -- they always put me in the umpire's chair! ""But I was stubborn and started to practice playing tennis every day by hitting balls against a wall. I wanted to beat my parents first, then my brother. That was the ultimate goal, to beat my brother, and when it happened I was so happy!"" Piotr has been Wozniacki's coach for most of her career, but she has also started working with Spaniard Ricardo Sanchez. ""My dad is still on court every day as well. I think it's important for me to stick to the same team,"" she said. ""I've always gotten someone from the outside helping me with small details, and yeah -- I am thinking that can help."" Wozniacki's recent Australian Open quarterfinal defeat to defending champion Kim Clijsters will have hurt her enormously, not least because it meant she also lost the world number one ranking she had held for 67 consecutive weeks. Critics bemoan the fact that Wozniacki has risen so high before earning a first grand slam title, but she has already won 18 WTA tournaments and earned nearly $12 million in career prize money. Add to that her celebrity boyfriend -- top golfer Rory McIlroy, who also hates losing -- and Wozniacki is fast becoming a darling of the tabloid press. The 21-year-old has no problems with the attention she receives and relishes being a role model to children, just like Martina Hingis and Venus Williams were when she was an adoring young fan. ""On the practice courts, I see the small girls wearing Stella McCartney outfits & Yonex rackets. It's really nice to see,"" said Wozniacki, referring to the clothes line she wears and the equipment she endorses. ""I remember myself when I was a little girl, looking up to Martina Hingis. I wanted to play like her and have the same clothes as her. ""I also remember when Venus came to Copenhagen for an exhibition. I was 12 at the time. I went down to the court and asked her if she would play one point with me. ""She did and I never forget that. I think it's also right to give something back to the people who follow you."" Wozniacki also gives something back to her fans via the Internet. Like McIlroy, she is an avid user of social networking site Twitter and has accumulated over 270,000 followers. McIlroy has a remarkable 800,000 followers, meaning over one million people get to know the couple's inner thoughts and feelings every day. ""I like Twitter a lot,"" said Wozniacki. ""It is a great way to get the fans knowing another side of you. ""I also think it is a good way to put things straight that are maybe misrepresented in the media.

"(CNN) -- They grow up so fast. It seems like only yesterday Tyler Posey was a child actor playing Jennifer's Lopez's son in the 2002 film ""Maid in Manhattan."" On Sunday night he reunited with his former co-star at the Teen Choice Awards. The ""Teen Wolf"" star co-hosted the awards show and ran onstage just as Lopez was about to present an award. ""I know we haven't seen each other since 'Maid In Manhattan' forever ago, but I thought that if you needed a backup dancer, I'd fit,"" Posey said before breaking into some dance moves. ""If I say yes, will you stop?"" Lopez replied. Clearly Posey should stick to acting. Since being cast as Lopez's son, Posey has worked steadily. He is best known for his role in MTV's hit series based on the 1985 ""Teen Wolf"" film that starred Michael J. Fox. In 2013, Posey appeared in ""Scary Movie 5,"" and he will next be seen in the comedy ""Taco Shop,"" according to Internet Movie Database.","Tyler Posey reunites with Jennifer Lopez .

"(CNN) -- When they're not hunting bad guys, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has designed a smartphone application for concerned parents. Child ID, the first mobile app made by the FBI, provides parents with a place to keep information about their children handy in case of an emergency. Parents can create separate entries for each kid, complete with photos, height, weight and other descriptive details. Then if a child disappears at the shopping mall, for example, a parent can quickly reference the info from her phone when filing a report to police. The app also has buttons for calling 911 or the national missing children hotline, as well as for transmitting the data about a lost child over the Internet. For anyone skittish about creating dossiers of their family within software conceived by the feds, the FBI lists an ""important note"" stating: ""the FBI (and iTunes for that matter) is not collecting or storing any photos or information that you enter in the app."" The data is kept in the device's memory and only transmitted when using the app for sending a report, the FBI says. Child ID debuted Friday as a free download for Apple iPhone and iPod Touch owners. The FBI plans to release versions of the program for other phones later, the government agency said in a statement. While the FBI is a newbie when it comes to building mobile apps, several other U.S. federal agencies have already released applications. The Internal Revenue Service, the Office of Personnel Management, the State Department, the Transportation Security Administration and the White House all have apps. Many are listed on USA.gov. The U.S. government seems to favor Apple's mobile platform for many of its software releases. Aneesh Chopra, the White House's technology chief, told the blog Switched two years ago that he uses a BlackBerry for work and an iPhone as his personal device.","The FBI released its first iPhone app on Friday .

"(Mashable) -- Is there a smaller, cheaper version of the iPhone on the way? Rumors abound, but now the Wall Street Journal has found ""people familiar with the matter"" who have actually laid hands and eyes upon it: . ""One of the people, who saw a prototype of a new iPhone several months ago, said the new device is intended to be sold alongside the current line of iPhones and would be about half the size of the iPhone 4. The phone, one of its codenames is N97, would be available to mobile carriers at about half the price of Apple's main line of iPhones, the person said."" According to the Wall Street Journal, Apple's also considering making its MobileMe online storage service free, allowing users to store their data in the cloud rather than on a small device such as an iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. This move could facilitate a smaller iPhone, which could store most of its data elsewhere rather than within its tiny confines. When will we see such a tiny iPhone, reportedly one-third smaller than its bigger brother, and costing $200 with no contract?

"(CNN) -- Perhaps the blog VentureBeat put it best: ""Twitter appears to have a problem sharing friends."" Twitter on Wednesday pulled access to a friend-finding feature that let Tumblr users search for contacts on Twitter who also use that blogging platform, Tumblr said in a statement. Tumblr users still can find friends using Facebook and Google. It's just the latest news in the saga concerning what critics say is Twitter's inability to play nice with its friends on the Internet. The social platform, once known for its openness, has been putting up walls around its service to make it more difficult for other sites and apps to access its data. Twitter largely has been mum on its motives for these changes, but some people have defended the company, saying it has to take control of its data to turn a profit. Twitter founders unveil new blogging tool . ""I don't think people understand that Twitter is a start-up that has to make money, not a non-profit-up,"" New York Times writer Nick Bilton said on Twitter. Tumblr is not happy about the most recent change. ""To our dismay, Twitter has restricted our users' ability to 'Find Twitter Friends' on Tumblr,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement. ""Given our history of embracing their platform, this is especially upsetting. ""Our syndication feature is responsible for hundreds of millions of tweets, and we eagerly enabled Twitter Cards across 70 million blogs and 30 billion posts as one of Twitter's first partners. While we're delighted by the response to our integrations with Facebook and Gmail, we are truly disappointed by Twitter's decision."" In July, Twitter revoked friend-finding access to the photo-sharing app Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. And it restricted the professional network LinkedIn, too. ""Consistent with Twitter's evolving platform efforts, Tweets will no longer be displayed on LinkedIn starting later today,"" LinkedIn wrote in June blog post. ""We know many of you value Twitter as an additional way to broadcast professional content beyond your LinkedIn connections. Moving forward, you will still be able to share your updates with your Twitter audience by posting them on LinkedIn."" Twitter also announced changes last week to some of the rules governing the way it shares data about its users with other sites. They go into effect in six months. The company, which acquired Tumblr's competitor, Posterous, in March, issued the following statement to CNN via e-mail: ""Some folks covering this have pointed to our comment from the Instagram situation. ('We understand that there's great value associated with Twitter's follow graph data, and we can confirm that it is no longer available within Instagram.') We don't have anything to share beyond that."" What's next for the Rich Kids of Instagram? Twitter's recent moves have been met with considerable criticism. ""This reeks of grade-school drama,"" Jennifer Van Grove of VentureBeat wrote in reference to the Tumblr friend-finder change. ""It's the second instance of Twitter acting like a bully and refusing to share its friends on the social networking playground."" Matt Buchanan, the BuzzFeed writer who predicted that Twitter would block Tumblr's friend-find feature, writes that all of these changes are confusing for developers of Twitter apps. Twitter increasingly sees these apps as competition, he writes. ""It's easy enough to say that the One Rule to Rule Them All is, 'Don't compete with Twitter.' Which is fine and dandy, because it's all for the greater good of Twitter or whatever. The problem is that it's real easy to be a valuable, contributing member of the ecosystem today and then tomorrow find out that you're now competition waiting to be crushed.""

"(CNN) -- ""Goodbye, Kai Tak, and thank you."" Fifteen years after Richard Siegel, Hong Kong's then-director of civil aviation, bid farewell and turned off the lights at Hong Kong Kai Tak International Airport, the old airport has been given a new life. With official ceremonies set for this week, it will be rechristened Kai Tak Cruise Terminal. The new facility will accommodate cruise ships and other large vessels. Royal Caribbean's Mariner of the Seas will be the first ship to arrive at the cruise ship berth -- formerly runway 13 -- today at 8 p.m. Before its closure in 1998, Kai Tak (the first recorded flight from the site took place in 1925) was regarded as one of the most difficult airports in the world for pilots to fly into and out of. As it sat in the middle of Kowloon City, with a runway protruding into the sea, landing in Kai Tak was a hair-raising event even for experienced pilots. Cathay Pacific Airways' general manager of operations and pilot Russell Davie has 36 years of flying experience. He remembers Kai Tak fondly. ""As a pilot, it was totally unique. It was the only major airport in the world that required a 45-degree turn below 500 feet to line up with the runway, literally flying between the high-rise buildings, passing close to the famous orange and white checkerboard as you made that final turn toward the runway,"" he said. Daryl Chapman, a teacher and aviation photographer from Britain who has lived in Hong Kong since 1987, spent countless hours photographing the amazing scenes of large aircraft swooping in over the Hong Kong skyline. (See a gallery of his work above.) ""Kai Tak was very different to most international airports because it was right in the city,"" recalled Chapman. ""Lion Rock (a prominent hill in Hong Kong) blocks the standard straight-in approach; thus planes had to make that special turn over Kowloon City while landing on runway 13."" ""This was quite a challenge, especially in strong wind conditions,"" Davie said. ""As Cathay pilots, we had plenty of practice and became very adept at flying the approach. ""The approach was quite a challenge for pilots from other airlines, especially in more demanding flying conditions, as they might only come to Kai Tak once a year."" World's most 'thrilling' airports, where thrilling = terrifying . Scariest moment: 'We never saw the actual plane!' Chapman recalls watching flights landing at Kai Tak during those ""demanding flying conditions."" ""Being at the Kai Tak car park watching airplanes land in heavy rain could be very worrying,"" he said. ""The pilots could not see the runway, and landing over Kowloon, you had to be visual with the runway. ""Some (pilots) seemed to wait a little longer than others before they aborted the landing and went around for another go. Some would appear out of the low clouds on the approach path, then power up and vanish back into the clouds."" The scariest memory for Chapman was the landing of an Air France 747-200 freighter contending with an extremely low ceiling. ""We could hear it coming but saw no sign of the landing lights. It was dark,"" he said. ""It got louder and louder; then you could see the glow of the red beacon under the plane. He overshot the turn and went right over the car park and control tower as he powered up and went around for another try."" ""That was very loud and worrying, as we never saw the actual plane!"" Fond memories of Kai Tak . Although the much larger and more modern Hong Kong International Airport (which opened in July 1998) is considered one of the best airports in the world, Kai Tak is still missed in some quarters. It served Hong Kong for 73 years and was something of a city symbol, known to travelers worldwide. ""I have very fond memories of Kai Tak,"" Davie said. ""When I first joined Cathay Pacific, I spent many happy hours walking around Kowloon City every time I had a visitor in town, watching the aircraft fly low over the houses and shops. ""The approach looked really amazing from the ground, and also as a passenger, especially if you were seated on the right-hand side of the aircraft."" Davie's favorite route was arriving from Japan or Taiwan, northeast of Hong Kong. ""This allowed the pilot to fly the aircraft initially along the East Lamma shipping channel before turning around the end of Hong Kong Island, past Green Island, and heading toward the checkerboard to make the final approach,"" he remembered. ""Passengers lucky enough to have a window seat had a fantastic view of the south side of Hong Kong Island, then Central and the harbor before landing over Kowloon.""","Kai Tak, Hong Kong's former airport, set to reopen as Kai Tak Cruise Terminal .

"(CNN) -- Legislatures in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico met in 2009, leading to the enactment of 40,697 laws, many of which take effect January 1. The new laws cover a variety of areas, from texting and tanning beds to human trafficking and seat-belt safety. New Hampshire, Oregon and Illinois join 16 other states that prohibit motorists from sending text messages while driving. Gloria Wilhelm fought for the Illinois law after her son, Matt, was struck and killed while he was riding his bike by a driver who was downloading cell phone ring tones. ""These are incredibly selfish and dangerous behaviors,"" she said. A new law in Oregon requires children under the age of 16 to wear a seat belt on an all-terrain vehicle or in a car while on public property. Same-sex couples will be able to marry in New Hampshire beginning January 1 under New Hampshire General Court HB 436, and the state joins Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and Iowa in legalizing same-sex marriages. In California, SB 54 requires the state to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states while such marriages were legal in California. The legislation covers same-sex marriages performed between June 16, 2008, and November 5, 2008, when a ballot initiative, Proposition 8, banned same-sex marriage in the state constitution. A California measure that limits trans fat in restaurant food also takes effect January 1. Enacted in 2008, it requires restaurants to use oils, margarines and shortenings that have less than half a gram of trans fat per serving. A similar provision will apply to baked goods in 2011. A statewide smoking ban in bars and restaurants that will take effect in North Carolina, the nation's biggest producer of tobacco, has drawn mixed reactions. ""I find it rather annoying that they're going to turn me into the police,"" tavern owner Van Allston said. Not all laws become effective January 1. State constitutions or statutes typically establish when laws go into effect, and the date is written into the specific piece of legislation.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Forget the red-hot property market of mainland China -- a new forecast says investors should be looking south. Jakarta -- Indonesia's burgeoning capital of nearly 10 million people -- is predicted to be Asia's top real estate market in 2013, ahead of cities such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Sydney in ""Emerging Trends in Real Estate -- Asia Pacific 2013,"" a real estate forecast released this week by PriceWaterhouseCoopers and the Washington D.C.-based Urban Land Institute. The recommendation to buy into Jakarta-based property may raise eyebrows, but PriceWatershouseCoopers says Indonesia's economic turnaround over the past few years has impressed international investors. ""Interest rates and inflation are under control, and while GDP is growing at around 6.5% annually, foreign direct investment is increasing at a much higher rateâ€”39% in the first half of this year,"" the survey said. ""Driven by increased demand from foreigners and locals alike, office rents shot up 29% year-on-year in the third quarter, according to (property services firm) DTZ."" That growth in demand helped Jakarta jump 10 places from its 2011 ranking but PwC warns the city's real estate scene is not entirely rosy. Difficulties in finding inexpensive bank loans, trustworthy local partners and land with disputed ownership all mean ""caveat emptor"" -- buyer beware. China's financial hub of Shanghai keeps its number two spot from last year. The PwC survey says the city's retail property sector is heating up as investors shift away from the commercial sector, traditionally ""the bread-and-butter investment for foreign funds in China for many years."" But PwC adds that foreigners are generally not as tempted to buy into Shanghai property as they were in the past. The major reasons: a real estate market that is already saturated, the rarity of commercial-grade investment buildings and Chinese regulators that are not as welcoming to foreign money as in years past. The tiny city-state of Singapore, traditionally a safe bet for real estate plays, comes in a close third, falling from last year's first place. PwC credits the Lion City's strong position as an Asian financial hub, an uninterrupted supply of real estate projects and continued demand for high-grade office space as the country attracts more employees from multinational firms. Put simply, both supply and demand for Singapore property is expected to stay strong in 2013, PwC reports. Asia-Pacific's Top 15 Asian Investment Prospects for 2013 . 1. Jakarta, Indonesia . 2. Shanghai, China . 3. Singapore, Singapore . 4. Sydney, Australia . 5. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia . 6. Bangkok, Thailand . 7. Beijing, China . 8. China--secondary cities (Chongqing, Tianjin, Shenyang) 9.

At number 13, the real estate outlook for Tokyo signifies a ratings downgrade from ""generally good"" prospects to ""fair"" prospects. PwC says the ranking for Japan's capital is surprisingly ""lackluster."" ""Though investment potential appears good, investors have found deal flows restricted by the ongoing reluctance of local banks to clear bad debt from their balance sheets. A wide bid/ask spread has also limited transaction volumes."" The forecast's lowest-ranked city for real estate investment in 2013 is Osaka and ranks at the bottom in most survey categories, from investment and development prospects to office buy/sell recommendations. One major reason is a glut of new office space that is still being completed. At the same time, PwC says ""in small regional cities such as Osaka, investors simply do not know where the bottom is because of uncertain demand."" The silver lining is that Osaka's four-year oversupply of office space is coming to an end, PwC says.","Indonesia's capital Jakarta is predicted to be Asia's top real estate market in 2013 .

"(CNN) -- The combined following of Manchester United stars Wayne Rooney and Rio Ferdinand on Twitter is an impressive 7.7 million -- more than the population of Switzerland. And to reflect the growing trend of footballers waxing lyrical on the micro-blogging site -- and occasionally overstepping the mark -- the English Premier League has now released their first ever set of guidelines on the subject. Only this week Chelsea and England defender Ashley Cole caused a storm when he joined Twitter and responded to the barbs from fans of his former club Arsenal by mocking them as to how many trophies he had won since leaving. And on Tuesday the English Football Association charged Arsenal's Emmanuel Frimpong for bringing the game into disrepute for something he posted on Twitter. The Premier League were quick to trumpet the benefits of having their stellar names on social media sites, like Twitter and Facebook, as it allows for interaction with numerous fans, but stressed it must be used responsibly. ""Social media is doing a good job of allowing fans to feel closer to the players,"" Premier League chairman Richard Scudamore was quoted as saying on their official website. ""There is a more human side now to some of the players and the public can communicate more directly with them. ""Clearly it isn't the same as texting your best mate or talking to someone in person and sometimes there can be abusive comments, but generally the internet, online chat rooms, and the way people are communicating is healthy."" According to the Premier League, their Facebook page and that of the 20 clubs in England's top division have attracted an aggregate of 60 million 'likes.' The figures underline the increasing importance of social media in sport, and the changing way in which people consume the action presented to them. More and more fans are not only watching the matches they attend, but filming them on mobile phones and uploading them to Twitter, Facebook or YouTube. ""The pleasure of sport lies not so much in witnessing an event as talking about it,"" Ellis Cashmore, professor of Culture, Media and Sport at England's Staffordshire University, told CNN recently. ""We've all at some point sat at home and watched a fight or a tennis match in isolation and it's never as enjoyable as when we are in company, talking about the competition as it unfolds. ""Mobile phones have opened out the possibilities. We can talk to anyone, anywhere while the action is taking place."" This new trend will be emphasized by the upcoming Olympics, with the number of users on Facebook having risen to 900 million -- nine times the figure it was for the Beijing Games of 2008. With a wealth of action taking place during the Games fans from across the globe can interact with each other via various platforms. Sebastian Coe, chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, thinks the strides made in technology means that by the 2020 Games there will be no such thing as a passive armchair fan. ""They (the armchair fans) are part of the action,"" he told reporters at the launch of a study by technology firm Atos. ""They can comment on content, interact with the athletes, create and publish their own content. Never before has there been such a channel to interact with the world, especially with young people.""","English Premier League unveils new code of conduct for social media websites .

"(CNN) -- Japan and the United States have co-signed an agreement to remove and dispose of hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium (HEU) and separated plutonium from the Asian nation. The fissile material will be transported from the Fast Critical Assembly (FCA) at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) in Japan to a ""secure facility"" in the United States, according to a statement released by the White House, and ""fully converted into less sensitive forms."" ""This pledge complements the significant role that both Japan and the United States are playing in finding new ways to continue improving global nuclear security ... Japan has demonstrated its leadership by resolving to remove all special nuclear material from the FCA. ""Our two countries encourage others to consider what they can do to further HEU and plutonium minimization."" Obama's long-term goal . The U.S. has a longstanding goal of reducing -- and safeguarding -- the world's stockpile of fissile material, in an effort to reduce access by terrorist groups, criminals and ""unauthorized actors."" The deal comes at a time when the U.S. hopes to persuade Iran to halt their enrichment program, and tensions on the Korean Peninsula are hightened by North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Barack Obama announced the deal this week at the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague. It allows for over 700 lb (315 kg) of weapons-grade nuclear material to be transported and ""downblended"" into safer material in the United States. The fuel, which was purchased from the U.S. in the 1960s, has been used by the JAEA for research purposes. The agreed-upon amount which will head to the United States is a fraction of Japan's overall plutonium holdings. Japan shows ""leadership"" ""This is the biggest commitment to remove fissile materials in the history of the summit process that President Obama launched,"" Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall of the National Security Council told the New York Times. ""It is a demonstration of Japan's shared leadership on nonproliferation."" Previously in favor of refinement of fuel for use it its own domestic nuclear power grid, the agreement comes at a time when many Japanese nuclear power facilities have been mothballed, following the 2011 reactor meltdown in Fukushima. The accident, which occurred when a powerful tsunami damaged the facility, was the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. Beijing has previously criticized Tokyo's stockpiling of nuclear material -- suggesting that it had the capability to produce nuclear weapons relatively quickly. However, as history's only victim of atomic warfare, Japan's post-war constitution forbids the pursuance of nuclear weapons, with public opinion also overwhelmingly against the policy. Japanese senior nationals security adviser Yosuke Isozaki told the Japan Times that ""Japan shares a vision of a world without nuclear weapons."" The U.S. hopes to convince more nations to use reprocessing and enrichment facilities in existing nuclear states in an effort to minimize proliferation risks.","Japan-U.S. agreement will see hundreds of pounds of Japanese nuclear material processed in U.S.

"(CNN) -- The grandson of one of the Vail ski mecca's co-founders died Tuesday in an avalanche that also trapped -- temporarily -- three others, county authorities said. Anthony ""Tony"" Seibert, 24, died in backcounty outside the ski boundaries of Vail Mountain -- the Colorado resort area that his grandfather, Peter Seibert Sr., co-founded -- according to officials in Eagle County. ""He was always an uplifting person and cheerful,"" said Scott Klumb, Seibert's friend of about 7 years who posted a tribute video online hours after his death. ""...He was always goofing around or getting other people excited and just making them happy."" The three others also trapped in the snow were rescued without major injuries. In fact, none of them had to be transported to a hospital, instead leaving the area on their own, Vail Valley Medical Center spokeswoman Lindsay Hogan said. The incident occurred in the East Vail Chutes roughly 90 miles west of Denver, with authorities first being alerted around 11:30 a.m., according to the Eagle County Sheriff's Office. According to the Vail resort's master development plan, ""The East Vail Chutes is an extremely steep, avalanche-prone bowl that drains down to Interstate 70 or to East Vail."" The avalanche occurred near the tree line ""in backcountry wilderness where they do not have avalanche control,"" explained Ethan Greene of the state-run Colorado Avalanche Information Center. ""This (avalanche) was most likely triggered by the people who got caught in it,"" Greene said. Two of those caught in the avalanche were on skis, the other two were on snowboards, according to Jessie Mosher of the Eagle County Sheriff's Office. She did not know what Seibert was doing. On a scale of 1 (least dangerous) to 5, the prospective avalanche rating around Vail was a 3, the rate around which most incidents like this happen, explained Greene, especially if people get fooled by otherwise nice conditions. ""Today was apparently a beautiful day up in Vail,"" Greene added, ""and therefore would be an appealing day to be out in the backcountry."" Seibert is the second person to die in an avalanche this season in Colorado. The other incident happened on December 31 on Parkview Mountain, west of Willow Creek Pass. The Colorado Avalanche Information Center noted there have been at least five such fatalities nationwide, including a snowmobiler killed on New Year's Day in Big Sky, Montana. Tony Seibert's grandfather was a legend in skiing, business and state circles, as evidenced by his inductions into the U.S. Ski and Snowboard and Colorado Business halls of fame, among many other honors. A soldier injured multiple times during World War II while with the U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division, the Sharon, Massachusetts, native moved to Colorado after the war, working at Aspen and making the 1950 U.S. ski team. After studies in resort management in France and Switzerland, he and fellow ski buff Earl Eaton scaled the top of the then-unnamed mountain that would become Vail in 1957 and opened it up as a ski area five years later. Peter Seibert Sr. served as the first president of Vail Associates and maintained a leading role for several decades, during which time Vail became one of America's biggest and most renowned ski resorts. He died in July 2002 at the age of 77. The Seiberts are an institution in Vail. Seibert was proud of this fact and his grandfather's legacy, recently appearing in the documentary ""Climb to Glory"" about the 10th Mountain Division's famed ski troopers. ""This is a shocking and terrible tragedy,"" Vail COO Chris Jarnot said, lamenting the end to Seibert's ""wonderful albeit tragically too short life."" ""This is an incomprehensible loss, and we will support the Seibert family and our community through this difficult time."" Seibert himself was heading into his final semester at the University of Colorado at Boulder at the time of his death, according to Klumb. He had his deep love for the Centennial State literally imprinted on him, in the form of a lone tattoo of the Colorado state flag cast in front of the Rocky Mountains. A superb freestyle skier, Seibert eventually gravitated toward the backcountry -- whether it was skiing, snowshoeing or hiking -- his friend said. So what might Seibert want people to learn from his own tragic death? Klumb surmised that it's that the backcountry should both be loved and be respected. ""What Tony would want ... is for others to be careful in the backcountry,"" he said. ""As exciting as it may look, you have to take the proper precautions.""

"(CNN) -- It all started out quite innocently, with jokes about the Queen's perma-frown and GIF collections of weird, what-the-Dickens moments from the opening ceremony. From there, however, the Twitter conversation about the London Olympics has taken a rapid turn toward the troll-ish. Athletes have been flaming sports announcers and lobbing racist comments at people from other countries. Pretty much everyone on the Internet has contributed to the #NBCFail hashtag. A spectator told a British diver that his fourth-place finish ""let your dad down."" (A dad, by the way, who died of cancer last year.) And Twitter itself has come under fire for briefly deleting the account of one of the Games' and NBC's biggest critics, purportedly for breaking the site's terms or use. Wasn't this supposed to be the ""Twitter Olympics,"" where everyone rejoiced in the digital-era magic of hearing directly from the world's best athletes and scrolling through a global, real-time conversation about what must be the planet's most ""Kumbaya""-like sporting event? It was. The International Olympic Committee even promoted it as such. But maybe that was the wrong expectation for a communications platform that has become much more than a feel-good public relations tool. As Brian Mossop wrote on Monday for Wired, Twitter has also helped fuel dictator-toppling protest movements. ""It's almost as if the IOC is completely unaware of the role Twitter and Facebook played in the Arab Spring,"" he wrote, ""or the frequency with which people use it to communicate in real time."" In terms of numbers, the London Games certainly have been the Twitter Olympics, far outpacing both the Beijing and Vancouver Games, when Twitter wasn't quite the global communications phenom it has become in 2012. ""There were more tweets in a single day last week than during the entire 2008 Beijing Games,"" Twitter wrote in a blog post on its UK site, adding that more than 60% of British athletes are on Twitter. ""We've already seen 10 million mentions of the term Olympics during the Games as fans use Twitter to get to the heart of the action,"" the company said. (Enough of that traffic came from London, by the way, that the Olympic committee reportedly asked spectators to refrain from tweeting and texting unless it's ""urgent,"" in an effort to lessen the network's load.) Over the years, Twitter, which did not respond to a request for comment on this story, has become the Olympics' ""cocktail hour,"" where both athletes and couch dwellers chatter about the games, said Jason Damata, spokesman for Trendrr, a social media tracker. In 2010, he said, more than 307,000 tweets contained the term ""Olympics"" on the first weekend of the Winter Games in Vancouver. This year, that number jumped tenfold, to more than 3.5 million tweets on the opening weekend of the Games in London. ""Two or four years ago it wasn't as common. Four years ago, especially, it was really just people in their houses saying 'Oh my gosh did you see that dive.' It was people talking to their social circles,"" he said. ""As Twitter as a platform has evolved and behavior has evolved, it is happening on both ends. Now there are way more athletes who are on. And there are way more people who are sharing their viewing habits, on Twitter especially."" 12 great Olympics-related Twitter accounts . What those athletes say, however, can be another matter. A Swiss athlete was expelled from the Games after he called South Korean athletes ""mongoloids,"" according to The Daily Mail; and a Greek triple-jumper was banned for writing on Twitter that ""With so many Africans in Greece, the mosquitoes from the West Nile will at least be eating some homemade food."" More benign, but still unexpected, was Hope Solo, an American soccer star, who used her Twitter feed to blast player-turned-analyst Brandi Chastain, telling NBC to employ a soccer commentator who ""knows more about the game."" And several prominent Olympians have taken to Twitter in protest of International Olympic Committee Rule 40. That rule bans the athletes from using their social media accounts to promote companies other than the official Olympic sponsors. ""I am honored to be an Olympian, but #WeDemandChange2012 #Rule40 @NBCOlympics"" several of the athletes posted. Opinion: Should we trust Twitter? That kind of political dissent is new, said Mark McClusky, a senior projects editor at Wired who is covering the Games. ""Athletes are taking to Twitter to voice frustrations with the way that the sports system is currently constructed and oriented,"" he said by phone from London. ""That's something we really haven't seen before -- or not in such a coordinated way, having a couple dozen really prominent Olympians starting to really talk about those issues. Beyond that I think it's just so much more part of how these athletes interact with the world than ever before, certainly. We saw some people tweeting at Beijing and a few more at Vancouver -- and now it's just part of the oxygen."" The London Games, however, have been testing the limits of how far Twitter, NBC and law enforcement will let the spitfire of real-time conversation go. British police reportedly arrested a 17-year-old ""on suspicion of malicious communications"" after he sent a Twitter message to UK diver Tom Daley telling the diver he had disappointed his recently deceased father by placing fourth in Monday's synchronized diving competition on the 10-meter platform. The Twittersphere erupted Monday and Tuesday after Twitter temporarily suspended the account of Guy Adams, a journalist who had been one of the harshest critics of NBC's decision to televise the Olympics on a delay in the United States. NBC complained to Twitter after Adams posted the e-mail address of one of its executives, asking people to air grievances with him. Twitter then suspended the account, saying that posting another person's private info is a violation of its terms. Meet the man who started #NBCFail . But some media analysts cried foul, saying Adams effectively was censored because of his views. ""What makes this a serious issue is that Twitter has partnered with NBC during the Olympics,"" Dan Gillmor wrote for The Guardian. ""And it was NBC's complaint about Adams that led to the suspension. That alone raises reasonable suspicions about Twitter's motives."" Adams' account was reinstated on Tuesday. Not all the Twitter Olympic chatter is negative, of course. As Twitter notes on its UK blog, the phrase ""good luck"" has been used more than 1.2 million times on the network since the Olympics began. And, according to Trendrr, the #NBCFail hashtag, which is the digital warehouse for complaints about the network's coverage in the United States, got less traffic over the weekend than Rowan ""Mr. Bean"" Atkinson did during his three minutes onstage during Friday's opening ceremony. Even the man credited with creating the #NBCFail meme said he thinks things have gotten a little out of hand. ""In some ways it's showing some of the worst sides of what this instant media can do,"" said Steven Marx, a 48-year-old who had only 17 Twitter followers before the hashtag spread. ""It's sort of that mob mentality that Twitter encourages. I think in this sense it's showing the bad. But in the Occupy (Wall Street) movement, it showed the good that Twitter can do for organizing. Even though it's made me slightly famous, I'm not necessarily thrilled with what's happened. I'm not terribly impressed with NBC, but that's not new this year."" Others are merely finding fun in the sport of being grouchy. ""I'm glad for Twitter so I can get real time results,"" one Twitter user wrote in response to a CNN question about the topic. ""A lot of the complaining is really funny, so I've been enjoying it.""","The London Games are being billed as the ""Twitter Olympics""

"(CNN) -- American military deaths in Iraq have dropped dramatically this year, a trend observers attribute to the lasting effects of the U.S.-led surge offensive, more robust Iraqi security performance and civilians' disgust with warfare. An Iraqi police officer secures the scene of a car bombing Saturday in Baghdad. A CNN count of Pentagon figures shows that 309 U.S. service members in Iraq have died this year: 222 in hostilities such as combat and attacks, and 87 in non-hostile circumstances such as traffic accidents, suicides and natural deaths. The U.S. death toll has been much higher in past years. Last year, 906 died: 768 in combat and attacks and 138 in non-hostile circumstances. There were more than 800 deaths in 2004, 2005 and 2006 as well. ""It's no single effort. It's a combination of efforts,"" said Maj. Gen. Jeffery Hammond, commanding general of Multi-National Division-Baghdad. ""The people of Iraq are tired of violence, and they are assisting the security forces; the government is improving its ability to govern and to apply the rule of law."" The decline in deaths coincides with a decrease in attacks. Maj. Gen. David Perkins said that last year, Iraq experienced nearly 180 attacks a day and that last week, the number dropped to an average of 10 a day. Gen. Thomas Metz, head of a military group dedicated to defending against roadside bombs, said this month that there had been a recent decline in the number of particularly powerful roadside bombs coming into Iraq from Iran. The bombs, called explosively formed penetrators, have been blamed for numerous U.S. troop deaths. The improvement comes as the United States prepares to withdraw its combat troops from population centers in 2009 from all of Iraq by the end of 2011. Commanders and others say the successes of the U.S.-led surge in establishing stability last year and this year in Baghdad and nearby towns and villages have decimated militant leadership and operatives, leading to a decline in attacks. ""The Iraqi security forces have increased their capability in the last 13 months here in Baghdad,"" Hammond said. ""The coalition forces and the Iraqi forces, in a combined effort, have pressed the insurgents and al Qaeda; more than 3,300 of them have been detained in the past year."" Michael O'Hanlon, senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, said the military is much better at thwarting roadside bombs, has developed a better informant network and has been dismantling the al Qaeda in Iraq movement. Maj. Brian Tribus, chief of media relations for Multi-National Corps-Iraq, emphasized the improved security performance and growth of Iraqi forces. U.S. deaths have dropped in part because Iraqi troops are taking more responsibility for fighting, he said. Iraqi troops often take the lead in security patrols, as 13 of 18 provinces now are under Iraqi security control. Tribus said that more than three times as many Iraqi security forces as coalition forces were killed or wounded from June to November. In the same period last year, they sustained 1.3 times as many casualties. Government offensives against Shiite militants in Basra, Amara and Baghdad's Sadr City and against al Qaeda in Iraq in the Mosul region illustrate Iraqi competency and resolve, Tribus said. Those operations also helped security forces develop their skills, he added. Another possible reason for the improved security has been the growth of the ""Awakening"" movement, in which Sunni tribes decided to take a stand against al Qaeda in Iraq in Anbar province. This movement's ideals spread to other regions, and from it, a U.S.- and Iraqi-backed program called the Sons of Iraq emerged. The largely Sunni militias, which include some former insurgents, have assisted in security duties. Sunnis once played a dominant role in the insurgency. Sunnis, who had more clout under Saddam Hussein's rule, are embracing the new governmental system. ""The Sons of Iraq represent one of the many success stories in Iraqi neighborhoods and communities,"" said Sgt. Brooke Murphy, a Multi-National Forces-Iraq spokeswoman. ""This organization began as simple groups of concerned local citizens striving to reclaim their neighborhoods from terrorists and criminals."" She said ""the importance of their contribution"" can be gauged by efforts of the Iraqi government and U.S. military to register members into Iraqi security forces and non-security related jobs. Tribus said the focus on advising and partnering Iraqi security forces will contribute to lower U.S. and coalition deaths. ""We expect the trend will continue downward as the [Iraqi security forces] take more of the lead,"" he said. CNN's Jill Dougherty and Jennifer Turner contributed to this report.","Deaths drop from 906 last year to 309 this year .

"(CNN) -- It's a shame what ""Family Guy"" has done to its dog. On Sunday's episode of the animated Fox series, the Griffin family pooch, Brian, was killed. (Seriously.) The intelligent and verbose pet was headed into the street to play with his ace companion, mischievous baby Stewie, when he was struck by an oncoming car. His injuries were so severe, he ended up having to say farewell to the family he's bonded with since 1999. Naturally, fans don't know what to make of this shocking news, with some having suggestions for another character who could've said goodbye: . To make matters worse, the series has replaced Brian with another pup named Vinny, voiced by ""The Sopranos' "" Tony Sirico. According to ""Family Guy"" executive producer Steve Callaghan, creator Seth MacFarlane is a ""big fan of 'The Sopranos' and always loved Tony Sirico in particular, and he thought it would be fun to write a character based around his voice and his personality,"" he told E! News. Apparently, the idea to kill off Brian was thrown out into the writers room, and ""it sort of caught fire"" as ""a fun way to shake things up."" ""As soon as this idea came up, we started talking about what the next couple episodes could be, and we got very excited about the way this change will affect the family dynamics and the characters,"" Callaghan said. MacFarlane's hit is now in its 12th season, and the creator has said that he'd be OK with ""Family Guy"" ending its run. In an October 2011 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the multitasking actor/writer/producer said he'd have been fine with wrapping the series a few years ago. ""Part of me thinks 'Family Guy' should have already ended,"" he told the magazine. ""I think seven seasons is about the right lifespan for a TV series. I talk to fans, and in a way I'm kind of secretly hoping for them to say 'we're done with it.' "" Viewers might wonder whether this move is a way to dissuade them from tuning in, but Callaghan doesn't foresee any backlash.

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Coast guard and other rescuers recovered at least 12 bodies after a passenger ferry with about 300 on board capsized in Bangladesh after getting caught in a tropical storm Thursday, officials said. The ferry began its journey at a Dhaka terminal and was a couple of hours into its journey when it capsized, officials said. Some passengers swam to the shore, while many others remain missing. Dozens of others floating in the Meghna river were safely brought ashore by the rescuers, officials said. The dead included women and children, police said. ""We've found 12 bodies so far ... many people are still missing. We can't exactly say how many are missing,"" district police superintendent Zakir Hossain Majumder told CNN. The death toll might rise as the rescue operation continues, deputy commissioner Saiful Hassan Badal said. ""It was a river estuary and very deep. ... I was on the deck of the ferry and jumped off as the ferry turned aside and started sinking,"" survivor Shafiqul Islam said. Shafiqui survived by swimming to the shore, he told CNN.

"(CNN) -- Archaeologists believe a desert site in Jordan may contain the ruins of the elusive King Solomon's Mines. Researchers using carbon dating techniques at Khirbat en-Nahas in southern Jordan discovered that copper production took place there around the time King Solomon is said to have ruled the Israelites. The research findings were reported in this week's issue of the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which came out Monday. King Solomon is known in the Old Testament for his wisdom and wealth and for building the First Temple in Jerusalem. The fabled mines entered popular culture in 1885 with the publication in Great Britain of the bestselling ""King Solomon's Mines"" by Sir H. Rider Haggard. In the book, adventurers in search of the mines find gold, diamonds and ivory. Since then, the mines have been the the subject of several films. Yet their possible location -- and whether they exist at all -- remains cloaked in mystery. Thomas Levy of the University of California San Diego, who led the research, said carbon dating placed copper production at Khirbat en-Nahas (Arabic for 'Ruins of copper"") in the 10th century -- in line with the biblical narrative of Solomon's rule. ""We can't believe everything ancient writings tell us,"" Levy said in a university statement. ""But this research represents a confluence between the archaeological and scientific data and the Bible."" Khirbat en-Nahas is an arid region south of the Dead Sea, in Jordan's Faynan district. The Old Testament identifies the area with the Kingdom of Edom. As early as the 1930s, archaeologists linked the site to the Edomite kingdom, but some of those claims were dismissed in subsequent years. ""Now ... we have evidence that complex societies were indeed active in 10th and 9th centuries BCE and that brings us back to the debate about the historicity of the Hebrew Bible narratives related to this period,"" Levy said.","Desert site in Jordan may contain the ruins of the fabled King Solomon's mines .

"(CNN) -- The family of Bob Levinson, who disappeared from Iran seven years ago, has long known he worked for the CIA -- a fact they once feared disclosing because the U.S. government told them it could put Levinson in even more jeopardy. Now, they believe it could be the key to bringing him home. Members of Levinson's family offered the revelation in an interview with CNN on Tuesday, in which they accused the U.S. government of failing to do enough to find and free the missing American and prodded it to act before it's too late. The family said it's time for the government to lay out the facts about Levinson's case. ""I hope they are hearing our request that (U.S. government officials) acknowledge what he was doing over there and they understand that the family does want this acknowledged now,"" the missing man's son, Dan Levinson, said. ""And we think it would be more of a positive step to getting him home."" U.S. officials have consistently denied publicly that Levinson was working for the government. At the same time, they have repeatedly insisted finding him and bringing him home is a ""top"" priority. Kerry: Levinson not 'abandoned' in Iran . ""We obviously stand with the family who are the ones who live with every single day that their husband or their father isn't home with them,"" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. ""So we are using every tool at our disposal to help bring him home to his family. We can't, obviously, talk about those."" White House officials have said they believe any recognition Levinson worked for the U.S. government is counterproductive. While Iran has consistently denied knowing where Levinson is, the family provided CNN with copies of documents they described as an arrest order and a memo saying Levinson had been diagnosed with diabetes, was transferred to a hospital and had fallen into a coma. The family said they obtained the documents from a source in Iran. They acknowledge they cannot authenticate the documents, but the family said they were provided a translation by the FBI and have been told the names of the officials listed on the document are real. Absent any other word about their missing loved one, it's the closest they have to proof that he was arrested and could remain in Iranian hands. But Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammad Javad Zarif Wednesday said he had not seen the documents and repeated that the government has no knowledge of Levinson's whereabouts. ""I have not seen anything that could prove that he was ever in Iran,"" he said Wednesday in an exclusive interview with CNN's Jim Sciutto. ""In fact, we have seen evidence ... he was last seen alive outside Iran, with pictures showing that he was outside Iran when he was last seen. It's a very unfortunate case. We've said clearly that we have no knowledge of his whereabouts... We need the United States to explain for Iran what a CIA operative was doing, if he was ever in Iranian territory, what was he doing in Iranian territory."" The Levinson family said Wednesday they ""would be very happy to provide Minister Zarif with the documents as soon as possible, and any other information he may need so that Bob can safely return home to us."" Dan Levinson said the family believes getting his father's work history out into the open gives them the best chance of reuniting with him once again. Bob Levinson, now 65, had gone to Iran on a mission to investigate corruption involving Iranian officials, according to an e-mail obtained by the family. Levinson disappeared shortly after arriving and has not been heard from since a 2010 video. His situation gained renewed urgency in December, when The Associated Press and the Washington Post reported that he was working as an independent CIA contractor when he disappeared. Reports: Missing American worked for CIA . The CNN interview was the Levinson family's first since these news reports publicly revealed the retired FBI agent was working as a CIA contractor at the time of his disappearance. The family's attorney, David McGee, said documents show ""without a shadow of a doubt"" that Levinson was a contract CIA operative who traveled extensively overseas recruiting and interviewing sources. One detail provided Tuesday to CNN includes an e-mail the family said was sent by Levinson to CIA officials discussing an investigation of Iranian corruption and discussion over the cost of his work. ""In connection with ongoing research I am conducting for an analytical report on the foreign investment of kickback and bribe monies of top Iranian government officials, an individual with detailed knowledge of this subject, with whom I have been in contact by phone and e-mail over the past year, has agreed to meet with me,"" the document reads. ""This meeting will take place either in Dubai or on an island nearby and should cost about two or three thousand dollars."" The family said the CIA at first lied to them about the trip. But after the family's lawyer discovered documents, including e-mails between Levinson and his handlers, the family said the CIA admitted Levinson was working undercover in Iran. Eventually, three CIA employees -- including Levinson's handler -- were fired and seven others disciplined in connection with the case. The CIA paid the family $2.5 million to avoid a lawsuit, McGee told CNN. The Justice Department is still investigating the CIA with an eye toward possible obstruction charges involving allegations that officials lied to the Senate Intelligence Committee about Levinson's status. The agency declined comment Tuesday. Levinson's wife, Christine Levinson, said the FBI is working the case hard, but the government overall should be doing more. ""We thought that they would do the right thing and get him home as soon as possible,"" she said. ""Unfortunately they haven't done anything, and this has been going on through two administrations, and nothing has gotten him home. And we don't know why."" The missing man's wife said the government should be using unspecified ""intermediaries"" to help negotiate a release. ""We have asked them in the past, and unfortunately we have not been able to get any intermediaries over there to Iran to work on the case,"" she said. ""And now is the time for the United States government to authorize someone to do this."" The government has been treating the disappearance as a criminal case more than one requiring negotiation to resolve, according to McGee, the Levinson family's lawyer. ""This is something far beyond a criminal investigation, but there are people who have experience, who have the training, and who have the contacts and who have the history who can contact the Iranians, who can deal with the Iranians in good faith, who have the trust of the Iranians who should be brought into this and they have not been brought in yet,"" he said. ""And that's one of our frustrations."" Who is Bob Levinson? Levinson's family hopes to return to Iran soon to press authorities to investigate the documents and provide more information. ""The Iranians have the documents,"" Christine Levinson said. ""They have done nothing with them. They have not told us anything since we gave them to them. We would like to do the investigation ourselves if they are not able to do it."" Zarif told CNN, ""If there is any hope or any use for this, Iran will consider it."" Levinson's family said Tuesday that they hope Iran's new president, Hassan Rouhani, will be more willing to help than his predecessor. ""What better way could he show the world that he is all about human rights and wants to do humanitarian deeds by helping a normal American family who is not political, who is not who has no concern other than getting their father home,"" Dan Levinson said. ""He has the power to do that, he has the power to talk to these people, put us in touch with these people and find out what happened to my father and send him home."" Americans detained abroad . CNN's Yon Pomrenze, Julia Lull and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","U.S. government has failed to do enough to free him, Bob Levinson's family says .

"Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- The city of Dubai is offering gold as an incentive for a weight loss initiative it will launch this week. The ""Your Weight in Gold"" program, which begins Friday registering and weighing participants in different parts of Dubai, will last about a month. The final weigh-in will take place August 16, after the end of the holy month of Ramadan. To qualify, contestants must lose a minimum of two kilograms (4.4 pounds) during the month, and they will receive one gram of gold for each kilogram of weight lost. Based on market prices Thursday in the United Arab Emirates, two grams of gold would be worth about $82. The three people who lose the most weight will be entered into a drawing for a gold coin worth more than $5,400. Would you lose weight if money were at stake? According to the statement by the Dubai Municipality, those taking part in the contest can register on any day during the month but must be overweight. Contestants are not allowed to use unhealthy methods to lose weight. ""Ramadan is the most appropriate season to launch such initiatives, as it reminds us about many health benefits of reducing weight and encourages us to take strong steps to change our bad lifestyles,"" said Hussain Nasser Lootah, the director general of the Dubai Municipality. Ramadan requires fasting from sunrise to sunset, but many people overeat when they break their fast. Dubai is famous for its big shopping malls, fast food chains and soaring summer heat that makes it difficult for people to exercise outdoors. Two years ago, the municipality launched the ""Yallah Walk"" initiative, which created walking tracks in different parts of the city to encourage a healthier lifestyle. Obesity is a big problem in the Arab Gulf countries. In the United Arab Emirates in particular, 33.7% of adults are obese, according to 2008 data used in a recent United Nations report. Kuwait has the highest percentage in the region, at 42.8%, with Saudi Arabia following at 35.2%. Nearby Qatar has 33.1%. Childhood obesity is also concerning in the United Arab Emirates. A 2005 study showed that the prevalence of obesity among youth is two to three times higher than the international standard. Against this backdrop, contests such as the one in Dubai may be a golden opportunity for change. Money talks when it comes to losing weight .

"(CNN) -- Ukraine has been hit by protests during the past few weeks, as the country finds itself split between the rest of Europe and Russia. What sparked the protests? The protests began in November, when Ukraine's president, Viktor Yanukovych, did a U-turn over a trade pact with the European Union that had been years in the making. Yanukovych refused to sign the agreement, which would have strengthened cooperation with the European Union, opting instead for closer ties with neighboring Russia. Since November 21 hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have taken to the streets of Kiev to demand that the EU deal be signed. The epicenter of the protest has been in the city' central Independence Square, known as the Maidan. The demonstrations are the biggest the country has seen since the Orange Revolution which toppled the country's government nine years ago. Protesters in Ukraine see the demonstrations as a way of choosing between Europe and Russia. CNN contributor David Frum says the stakes are even higher now than they were in 2004-05: ""Upholding Ukrainian independence is a deep concern, not only to the Ukrainians, but to all the free countries of Europe -- and thus to the United States... What's at stake in the streets of Kiev is the future of the European continent."" Why did Yanukovych refuse to sign the EU deal? Viktor Yanukovych, who has been in power since 2010, said he could not sign the trade and political association deals with the EU because of Ukraine's ""complex economic situation."" He said Ukraine could not afford to sign the deal, alluding to economic pressure from Russia, which had threatened its neighbor with trade sanctions. ""The Ukrainian government will suspend the negotiations for signing the Association Agreement with the EU, until we find a solution for the situation is found and when the drop in industrial production and our relations with CIS countries are compensated by the European market, otherwise our country's economy will sustain serious damage,"" said Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Yuriy Boiko when the EU deal was suspended. Russian President Vladimir Putin has not publicly admitted pressuring Yanukovych into foregoing the agreements, which would have moved Ukraine further from Russia's sphere of influence, instead insisting he wants the country's difficulties to be resolved. ""I very much hope that all political forces of the country will manage to come to an agreement in the interest of the Ukrainian people and solve all the piles of problems,"" Putin said in his State of the Nation address on Thursday. But as Ulrich Speck, visiting scholar at the Carnegie Europe think tank in Brussels, wrote in a piece for CNN, Putin wants to see Ukraine -- and other former Soviet republics -- brought back into line with Russia ""through integration into a Moscow-led customs union which in the future shall be transformed into a fully-fledged 'Eurasian Union'."" Another factor in Yanukovych's decision not to sign the deal is likely to have been the EU's demands that he free former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, his political opponent, from jail. Russia said Thursday December 12 that the European Union is trying to bully Ukraine into signing a free trade deal against the wishes of the majority of Ukrainians. ""The EU offers a token package, which is not of any interest to the Ukrainian government,"" Alexei Pushkov, head of the Foreign Affairs Committee in Russia's Parliament, told CNN's Hala Gorani, who was sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Tymoshenko was found guilty of abuse of office in a Russian gas deal two years ago, and sentenced to seven years in prison in a case widely seen as politically motivated. On Thursday December 12th, The EU's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, spoke to Yanukovych and told CNN afterwards that he ""still wishes to sign the association agreement with the European Union."" Pushkov said he was not so sure. ""He never actually rejected the possibility of signing a deal with the European Union,"" he said. ""But he said on many occasions that he is not happy with the content of the deal."" Why is Ukraine torn between the EU and Russia ? Ukraine is the biggest frontier nation separating Russia and the EU. Once part of the Soviet Union, the country gained its modern Independence in 1991 following the fall of the Berlin Wall. Since then, Ukraine has made an effort to move towards Western ideals when it comes to politics and human rights, but the nation is still ranked 144th out of 177 countries in Transparency International's corruption index. The Ukrainians who have taken to the streets in recent weeks say they want to see a better-governed, less corrupt and politically liberal country, more closely aligned with its western neighbours. ""People see a prosperous, well-governed EU next to their borders -- in sharp contrast with their own economic and political misery,"" wrote Speck, in his piece for CNN. ""That's why they are on the streets now, in Kiev and elsewhere."" Under Soviet rule, many Ukrainian farmers lost their lands and homes, and many ethnic Russians settled in the Ukraine. Under Soviet Rules the country's people their language and culture all suffered. ""No nation suffered more from Soviet communism than the Ukrainians,"" wrote Frum in his recent piece for CNN. ""Ukrainian farmers lost their lands and homes to Soviet collectivization... millions died in the man-made famine that followed... their language and culture were stunted under Moscow rule; their intellectuals and writers were suppressed, banished, murdered, and defamed."" This caused a split which still exists in the Ukraine today, where a strong east-west divide remains, with the East of the nation being mostly Russian-speaking, with a large ethnic Russian population, and the West of the country being Ukrainian. Ukraine's economy has been slow to follow its western neighbours who were also under Soviet control-- Poland, for example, where the economy has grown exponentially. Poland was not part of USSR, but can say ""also part of the Soviet Union or under Soviet control -- for example, Poland, where the economy has grown exponentially."" By contrast, Ukraine's economy has deteriorated further and has suffered its worst years since the fall of the Soviet Union.. Many Ukrainians hope that an EU deal would offer the chance of economic recovery. Why is Russian gas a key issue? Ukraine with a population of over 45 million is heavily dependent on Russian gas to keep the country running during its bitterly cold winters. Its geographic location it is also a key transit country through which gas flows to many countries in Europe. This puts Russia in a commanding position -- energy is a lever the Russians have used in the past, either by cutting off supplies in mid-winter (most recently in 2009) or by promising price cuts or increases. Ukraine, with a population of 45 million, is heavily dependent on Russian gas to keep the country running during its bitterly cold winters. How does the situation affect the rest of the region? The West -- the EU, together with the US -- has been working on its relations with former Soviet Bloc countries for over two decades, with the aim of restoring democratic rule and improving quality of life for Ukrainians. It views the decision by Ukraine, the largest of the former republics, not to partner up with the EU as bowing to Russian pressure. Ukraine is something of a pawn between Russia and the West. For the West, the deal would mean its reach would spread further east; by contrast, the Russians see the Ukraine as key to holding on to their turf. When asked about the situation in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov insisted it was a ""domestic issue"" and that it is the prerogative of the government to decide whether to sign the agreement.","Ukraine protests are the country's largest in nine years .
The country finds itself split between closer ties with the EU and cooperating more with Russia .

Prosecutors said they had returned the seized collection to Cornelius Gurlitt, who inherited the almost priceless artworks from his father, in light of new evidence. Their statement came two days after news of a deal between Gurlitt, Germany's cultural authorities and the Bavarian Justice Ministry under which he agreed to allow research into the origins of suspected cases of looted or so-called ""degenerate"" art. Under the deal, works owned by Gurlitt which are not under suspicion can be returned to him. Those suspected of being stolen will be held securely while a task force investigates their provenance -- and will be returned to their original Jewish owners or their descendants if a claim is proven. Works which have not been investigated by the end of a year will be returned to Gurlitt, it says. It's not clear how many pieces may be the subject of claims from those who believe they were looted decades ago. But a statement on Gurlitt's website says that ""according to current information at most 3% of the 1,280 confiscated works"" could be involved. That would work out to about 38 paintings. Gurlitt's spokesman, Stephan Holzinger, said Monday that there was a second claimant for a Henri Matisse painting found in his hoard, ""Femme assise"" or ""Seated Woman."" Gurlitt's lawyer has said the claim must be properly examined before the painting can be returned. However, this doesn't change Gurlitt's intention to return pictures to their rightful owners if a claim is proven, Holzinger said. Among the staggering haul found in Gurlitt's Munich, Bavaria, apartment in early 2012 were paintings by Pablo Picasso, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Oskar Kokoschka, Canaletto, Pierre-August Renoir, Franz Marc and Gustav Courbet. Gurlitt, 81, says he never suspected that the collection he inherited from his father might include stolen artworks. Thousands of pieces of art condemned as ""degenerate"" by the Nazis were confiscated from galleries and private collectors in the 1930s and 1940s. Other works were stolen from Jewish families or sold for a fraction of their true value as the owners tried to flee the country. Gurlitt's father, Hildebrand Gurlitt, who was part Jewish, survived the war as one of only four ""degenerate art"" dealers permitted by Adolf Hitler. Prosecutors cite new evidence, objections . It was last May when experts revealed that the artworks -- many long feared lost or destroyed, and some which had never been recorded -- had been discovered in Gurlitt's apartment in the Schwabing area of Munich. The vast collection, which experts have said has ""a value so high it cannot be estimated,"" was recovered by German tax authorities in connection with an inquiry into tax evasion in February and March 2012. In its statement, Wednesday, the prosecutor's office defended its decision to seize the cache, now known as the Schwabing art trove, on the grounds it might contain stolen art. ""At the time of the confiscation of the entire collection, the Augsburg prosecution was entirely convinced of the rightfulness of the measure,"" it said. But, it said, the new evidence and the representations of Gurlitt's defense lawyers have led the office ""to assess the legal situation anew."" The investigation is not yet concluded, however, the prosecution said. The defense has applied to view more files and has yet to make its position public, it added. 'Fair solutions' Gurlitt told German magazine Der Spiegel last November that he longed for the paintings he inherited to be returned to him -- and that he regarded them as his only friends. The reclusive retiree also defended his father's wartime dealings, saying ""maybe he was offered something privately, but he would not have taken it. It would not have been good for him."" His father, by all accounts a savvy dealer, removed the huge collection from his house in Dresden during the devastating bombing in the final days of World War II, and moved it to what later became West Germany. A statement on Gurlitt's website states that he ""was at all times convinced that he had inherited a collection from his father that predominantly consisted of so-called degenerate art from former German Reich property in public collections and museums,"" and that he was unaware it ""includes a few works that today can be qualified as looted art."" Now, it says, he is ""is prepared to review and arrive at fair solutions together with the claimants for those works that are suspected of being looted art in such instances where qualified, documented, and justified claims for their return are asserted by heirs of Jewish of persecution and where morally compelling grounds exist."" CNN's Bryony Jones contributed to this report.","A stunning art collection confiscated from Cornelius Gurlitt has been returned to him .

"(CNN) -- Truly, it's been a summer for jokers -- and I'm not just talking about ""The Dark Knight."" ""Tropic Thunder"" stars Ben Stiller and Robert Downey Jr. as self-absorbed actors. When the bat's been away, Steve Carell (""Get Smart""), Will Ferrell (""Step Brothers"") and Seth Rogen (""Pineapple Express"") have all come out to play, and notched up lucrative returns, too. Ben Stiller's sometimes hilarious ""Tropic Thunder"" is easily the biggest of the summer's blockbuster comedies -- and certainly the goriest. It's a high-concept meta-movie about an all-star Vietnam War picture (also called ""Tropic Thunder"") that goes very, very wrong. Stiller's ""Tropic Thunder,"" on the other hand, gets it mostly right. Which is just as well, because it looks like it cost an arm and a leg to make. The movie-within-a-movie is directed by Damian Cockburn (Steve Coogan) and stars chubby clown Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson), action beefcake Tugg Speedman (Stiller) and Aussie method man Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.). The latter is a temperamental chameleon who takes his craft so seriously he has undergone skin pigmentation treatment for his role as a black GI. (Any resemblance to Russell Crowe is entirely superficial but can hardly be coincidental.) Cockburn quickly loses the trust of his ferocious, potty-mouthed studio boss (in one of the film's more inspired insider gags, he's played by a real-life studio boss you may just recognize as Tom Cruise). So when disabled Vietnam vet ""Four Leaf"" Tayback (Nick Nolte) -- the inspiration for the movie -- suggests dropping them into the jungle and shooting the picture with hidden digital cameras, ""guerrilla-style,"" it seems like a stroke of genius. That is, until the stars lose contact with the outside world and find themselves in a firefight with Golden Triangle drug lords. ""Tropic Thunder"" is willing to push its gags right to the edge -- and sometimes over it. In the most famous example, the film has run into flak from disabled advocates for its repeated use of the word ""retard,"" referring to Speedman's previous bid for artistic respectability, a sentimental ""Forrest Gump""-style Oscar bid by the name of ""Simple Jack.""  Watch why several groups want to boycott the film » . Stiller does milk it, but the protesters are missing the point. If there's one group who should be protesting this movie it's the Screen Actors Guild. The heart-rending, soul-searching, consciousness-raising commitment we prize in our movie stars, particularly around Oscar time -- it's all beautifully travestied and lampooned. An early bad-taste highlight has Tugg messing with his director's head. Literally. And the strained relationship between Alpa and Kirk -- who proves incapable of breaking out of his African-American character -- is terrifically juicy. Downey's blackface performance is an appalling mixture of Mr. T and Uncle Remus, but at the same time he endows the actor with enough straight critical intelligence to appreciate the severity of their situation. The effect is simultaneously funny and a little disturbing. Lazarus is the one character who leaves an indelible impression among some overly familiar caricatures. The Asian characters, in particular, rightfully belong in some third-rate ""Deer Hunter"" knock-off. Which doesn't mean that ""Tropic Thunder"" -- which was written by Stiller, Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen -- isn't funny. It can be scattershot, even with its fairly safe targets, but when it hits it hits dead-on. (It's not wildly original and outrageous, though, to anyone who's seen Coogan in ""Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story"" or watched the Ricky Gervais series ""Extras,"" in which Stiller played himself in one episode.) iReport.com: Share your thoughts on 'Tropic Thunder' But after an hour or so the movie's one big joke starts wandering around in circles and we're stuck watching a painfully unfunny Jack Black flailing about in mock heroin withdrawal; Tugg reprising Simple Jack, yet again; and a silly, authentically B-movie climax which involves everyone shooting blanks. Still, if it doesn't live up to its full potential there is more than enough to keep you smiling, not least its production values. The film was photographed by John Toll, who shot ""The Thin Red Line,"" and he gives it a look to compete with the Vietnam movies it has in its sights (""Platoon,"" especially, gets a ribbing). There's also the now-cliched '60s jukebox soundtrack to go with it. And though some of the caricatures wear thin, some of the acting rises to a high level. There's Downey, of course, but also Jackson and Jay Baruchel's nicely gauged supporting turns, and a blitzkrieg of celebrity cameos including Tobey Maguire, Matthew McConaughey and Jon Voight. As for Mr. Cruise, he's still the best mover and shaker in Hollywood. He should try this stuff more often. ""Tropic Thunder"" is rated R and runs 106 minutes.

"Blue Mountains, Australia (CNN) -- More than 70 wildfires -- including 29 that are uncontained -- are raging across a wide swath of Australia's most populous state, now threatening the western suburbs of Sydney, authorities said Wednesday. ""It's only a matter of hours before we see a flare-up in fire activity and a breach of these tenuous containment strategies,"" said Shane Fitzsimmons, Rural Fire Service (RFS) commissioner, in Sydney earlier in the day. The wildfires stretch along a nearly 1,000-mile line in New South Wales, from the far north of the state south of Brisbane -- which lies just across the Queensland border -- to east of Canberra, the country's federal capital. Fires in the Blue Mountain range west of Sydney are a particular worry as rough terrain has impeded firefighting efforts. ""If our strategies don't work and weather materializes tomorrow that is forecast ... it could be absolutely devastating,"" said Rural Fire Service (RFS) Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers in New South Wales on Tuesday. ""We lost a couple hundred homes the other day -- we could get worse losses than that."" Wednesday is expected to be ""about as bad as it gets,"" added Fitzsimmons. With high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds forecast, fire officials have urged residents to evacuate from the path of the fires. ""On days like today, minutes really matter,"" Fitzsimmons said. At least one death has been reported. A 63-year-old man died of a suspected heart attack Friday while defending his home against a blaze on the New South Wales Central Coast, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, or ABC, reported. 'Eerie' skies over city of Sydney . Some urban areas that border the Australian bush have been devastated by the fires, which have destroyed more than 200 homes in the Blue Mountains region since Thursday. Scores of fires now have burned 25,800 hectares (310,859 acres) -- an area greater than the size of Los Angeles. On Tuesday, officials said they were bringing in 1,500 firefighters to join the more than 1,000 emergency crews already on the ground. At Blue Gum Forest inside the Blue Mountains National Park, firefighters were doing controlled burns -- setting fires in the bush ahead of the frontline of the blazes to eliminate tinder and slow the progress of the fires. Instead of cloud-shrouded mountaintops, the valleys of the region were covered with a dense layer of smoke. Fears are still high that fires could join to form a ""mega-fire"" and endanger heavily populated areas of this popular natural retreat west of Sydney. Most of the firefighters in the area were volunteers who've left their ordinary jobs to put out the fire, pouring in from different parts of Australia. ""There's a sense of community, doing what they can -- you can get a sense of resilience, strength, and a deep sense of pride of each brigade pulling their weight,"" said CNN's Robyn Curnow, reporting from the Blue Mountains. The state of emergency issued by authorities gives firefighters and police the authority to carry out measures such as cutting off water, power and gas and ordering mandatory evacuations of areas at risk. A total fire ban is in place for the Greater Sydney region until further notice, officials have said, meaning no fire may be lit in the open, and all fire permits are suspended. The fires have spread a cloak of smog over Sydney in recent days. The bush fires in the area spread out of control Thursday amid high temperatures and powerful winds. Emergency officials said the region is emerging from a very dry winter and has had little rain in recent months. The causes of the Blue Mountains fires are still under investigation -- officials are looking into whether one major blaze was caused by a military training exercise. Police said Monday they had arrested two boys, age 11 and 15, over two earlier bush fires in the Port Stephens area, more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Sydney, that began October 13. One of the fires they are accused of starting burned more than 5,000 hectares (12,000 acres) in the surrounding area. The 11-year-old has been placed under house arrest, charged with two counts of intentionally causing fire and being reckless as to its spread, NSW Police Force said. The child is scheduled to appear in court next month where he is expected to plead not guilty to the charges, CNN affiliate Sky News reports.

"(CNN) -- The late Kemal Amin ""Casey"" Kasem was much more than a relic of radio's Top 40 heyday. In this era of streaming and downloading, when everyone functions as his or her own DJ and program director, the ""tastemaking"" role of music radio in the late 20th century -- the role that Kasem pretty much owned -- is almost impossible to fathom. Casey Kasem was neither a maverick like pioneer rock & roll disc jockey Alan Freed nor a budding multimedia entrepreneur like Dick Clark. He didn't strive to be hip or hustle after the cutting edge. He wasn't really a gatekeeper or curator. His on-air presence was neutral; he merely was a conduit for whatever records were most popular. Each week he'd present the top singles as reported on the Billboard charts, framing the songs with homespun advice, listener dedications and decidedly noncontroversial anecdotes about the performers. From 1970 to 1988, his syndicated weekly program, ""America's Top 40,"" documented the ever-shifting mainstream of musical tastes. By today's standards, it can sound overly cautious or conservative, but it also reflected a cultural consensus that barely exists anymore. Kasem's long-distance dedications . Easily accessible and free of charge, ""America's Top 40"" was a gateway drug for a generation or two of budding music fanatics. Kasem was the patron saint of preteen pop devotees held captive to their parents' car radios. His data-dependent chart format made him an enabler for amateur statisticians and precocious list-compilers, kids who couldn't afford subscriptions to the trade magazines. The sturdy scaffolding under Kasem's success was his voice: upbeat, naturally modulated, soothing without being smarmy. Hear him once and he became Casey: familiar, somehow. You could accuse him of being corny, a shameless Pez dispenser of sentimental patter and clichÃ©d advice along with pablum pop. You'd be literally correct but also fundamentally clueless about his down-to-earth appeal. Kasem managed to be commercial without coming across like a hyped-up huckster. He made it seem easy, and also seamless, for instance segueing from a convoluted factoid about Top 10 hits with the word ""Doctor"" in the title to a Dr. Pepper spot. His voice was the product of formative years spent jumping from radio station to station as well as some acting work. Voice-over gigs proved to be a consistent and profitable sidelight; Kasem's resonant tones appeared in commercials and cartoons. Somewhat improbably, he supplied the voice of Norville ""Shaggy"" Rogers on ""Scooby-Doo."" No doubt this further endears him to a generation weaned on musty anachronisms such as network television and Top 40 radio. Tributes: 'Keep reaching for the stars' Truthfully, even at his most popular, Kasem was a bit of an anachronism. When ""America's Top 40"" debuted in 1970, the rock revolution was in full swing, and free-form FM radio was on the rise. But he stuck to the middle of the road, and not only endured but thrived during the tumultuous expansion and dissolution of the musical counterculture in the ensuing decades. The Top 40 renaissance of 1984, kick-started by MTV, and the late '90s teen pop explosion can both be seen as vindication of Kasem's rigidly democratic format. In fact, the millennial breakthrough of boy bands and Britney Spears may go down in history as the Top 40's last hurrah. Born the son of Lebanese immigrants in Detroit, Kasem went on to become the iconic voice of common-denominator music during a divisive time in our culture. In the end, what could be more American?","Mark Coleman: Casey Kasem was ""tastemaker"" before era of streaming and downloading .

"(CNN) -- Iran has threatened that it will retaliate against the Obama administration's proposed new economic sanctions on Iran's oil exports by blocking the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf. ""If sanctions are adopted against Iranian oil,"" said Iran's Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi, ""not a drop of oil will pass through the Strait of Hormuz,"" the narrow waterway at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, which one-fifth of the world's oil supply passes through daily. To drive the point home, Iran has started a 10-day naval exercise in the Persian Gulf to show off how it could use small speedboats and a barrage of missiles to combat America's naval armada. And the U.S. Navy has responded, in the words of a spokeswoman: ""Anyone who threatens to disrupt freedom of navigation in an international strait is clearly outside the community of nations; any disruption will not be tolerated."" This is a significant escalation of tension between the United States and Iran, and the start of a more dangerous phase in the West's attempt to curtail Iran's nuclear program. The new sanctions are a response to last month's alarming report on Iran's nuclear intentions by the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Association. The Obama administration has ruled out military strikes to stop Iran's nuclear program in favor of tougher sanctions, which, once signed by the president, and if fully implemented, would sharply reduce Iran's oil revenue. The administration sees this added pressure on Iran's fragile economy as an effective alternative to military strikes. If Iran's reaction is any indication, the administration is correct in its estimation. Sanctioning Iran's oil industry will cripple Iran's economy, and that in turn will threaten the stability of the clerical regime. It is for this reason that Iran is treating the proposed new sanctions as an act of war, and is issuing threats of its own to dissuade the United States from going through with the new sanctions. The administration's strategy is based on the assumption that cutting Iran out of the oil market will not substantially impact world oil supply and prices. Saudi Arabia can step up production to cover the loss of Iran's export of 2 million barrels a day. But it is not clear whether Saudi Arabia actually would increase production to compensate for the loss of Iranian oil. Iran has clearly started a charm offensive with Riyadh to influence the Saudi decision. Iran's intelligence minister recently visited Riyadh to reduce tensions between the two countries in the wake of the alleged Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to Washington, and the Iranian Navy has claimed that it rescued a Saudi ship from pirates. In facing off against the U.S. and its European allies, Iran thinks it holds economic cards of its own and is announcing loud and clear that if push comes to shove, it intends to use them. Iran notes that Western economies are under stress and predicts they could not afford higher oil prices. Even the threat of disruption in oil supply would send energy prices spiraling sky high, and that would plunge the already struggling economies of the United States and Europe into deeper recession. Iran is hoping to change the conversation in Western capitals from how tightly to squeeze Iran to what could be the cost of doing so. Nor would economic woes caused by conflict in the Persian Gulf remain limited to the West. Persian Gulf exports already account for 60% of Asia's energy consumption. Economies from India to China would be impacted by a Persian Gulf oil cutoff and higher energy prices. Iran is in effect threatening global economic crisis. Those advocating new sanctions on Iran's oil industry have said little about the potential cost to the global economy. The cutoff would also hurt Gulf Cooperation Council countries and could drag them into a conflict with Iran they have thus far avoided. Iran hopes its saber-rattling will persuade Asia's economic powerhouses and Persian Gulf emirates to pressure Washington to back away from the new sanctions. War between the U.S. and Iran may very well start, not if and when Washington decides to strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, but because sanctions designed as the alternative to military action end up hastening its advent. That might prove to be the least desired outcome, for no better reason than the possibility that the first casualty of another war in the Middle East might very well be economic recovery in U.S. and Europe.

"(CNN) -- At least 34 people were killed and 94 injured after twin explosions rocked a market in the Sadar area of Peshawar, Pakistan, authorities said early Sunday. The first blast, relatively small, went off in the restroom of a restaurant in the crowded Khyber Super Market, according to Shafqat Malik, chief of bomb disposal in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. People gathered at the scene and many were casualties after a suicide bomber on a motorbike arrived at the restaurant minutes later and set off explosives, Malik told CNN. Muhammad Ejaz Khan, a senior police official in Peshawar, said about 10 kilograms of explosives were used in the second blast. The neighborhood is a residential area popular with single professionals and students. It features hotels and shops. Saif Ul Islam Saifi, president of the press club in Peshawar, said one journalist was killed and nine others were hurt. A provincial minister said two journalists died. There are several media offices in the area. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Peshawar and the surrounding region have been swamped by a wave of violence in recent months. Just a week ago, on June 5, at least 19 people were killed and dozens wounded at a bakery in the town of Nowshera, about 26 miles (42 kilometers) east of Peshawar. That same day, three women and a child were among those killed in an explosion at a bus stand in Matni, 13 miles (22 kilometers) from Peshawar. On May 25, a suicide bomber rammed a police station in Peshawar, killing at least seven police officers. Officials said about 660 pounds (300 kilograms) of explosives were packed into a minitruck. More than 60 militants attacked a security checkpoint near Peshawar on May 18. Ten militants and at least two security personnel were killed in the ensuing gun battle. A roadside bomb was planted near the Peshawar home of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province's agriculture minister on May 8. It detonated as guests were leaving the minister's house, injuring at least four people. A 12-year-old boy died in a suicide blast April 1 in a town about 34 miles (55 kilometers) southwest of Peshawar. On March 9, at least 37 people were killed in a suicide attack on the funeral of the wife of a pro-government militia member. A suicide bomber detonated explosives during a funeral procession on the outskirts of Peshawar. Eight girls were injured on March 1 when militants on motorbikes threw grenades into a girls' school in Mardan, nearly 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Peshawar. More than two dozen militants wielding automatic weapons attacked NATO oil tankers on February 25, at a terminal on the outskirts of Peshawar. Four people were killed and explosive devices were planted under a dozen tankers. On February 10, a teenage suicide bomber killed at least 27 army recruits in Mardan. The suicide bomber was about 14 and was wearing a school uniform when he detonated his explosives in a military training center. A powerful car bomb rocked a neighborhood on the outskirts of Peshawar on February 2. At least nine people were killed and 21 injured. Police were the target of a double attack in Peshawar on January 31. A bomber walked in front of a marked police van and blew himself up, killing at least four. Another police officer was killed by a bomb while on patrol hours later. A remote-controlled bomb exploded near a school in Peshawar on January 19. At least two people were killed and 10 wounded. Another school bus was hit by a remote-controlled bomb on the outskirts of Peshawar on January 12. The bus was carrying female teachers and students. Two teachers were killed and seven students wounded. Journalist Lehaz Ali contributed to this report.","NEW: Peshawar and the region have experienced a wave of violence .

"(CNN) -- A community in tears. That's how the mayor of Las Vegas described her city after a husband-and-wife team gunned down two police officers and a civilian. The officers were on their lunch break at a pizza place. They had no time to react. The third victim, a civilian, attempted to confront the couple at a nearby Walmart, and died in the process. A day after the killings, the three were being remembered Monday for their sacrifice and service. ""We're a community in tears here. I will tell you these were wonderful officers,"" said Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman. Here's a closer look at those killed: . Alyn Beck, 41 . Officer Beck, 41, joined the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) in August 2001. His friends say he was a good person, always willing to lend a hand. ""He was always about service. He was the funnest guy. He was, you know, you think of some people who are good in eulogy only, and Alyn is the absolute opposite of that. ""Alyn is easy to eulogize because that's all he was, was good,"" said Tracy Smith, a friend. Beck is survived by his wife and three children. Igor Soldo, 31 . Officer Soldo joined the police department in April 2006. He attended high school in Lincoln, Nebraska, and worked as a corrections officer before joining the force. Described by family as a good father and a great man, Soldo is survived by his wife and baby. He and Beck were on their lunch break at a CiCi's Pizza when authorities say Jerad and Amanda Miller came into the restaurant and opened fire on the officers at close range. ""I think you can all imagine if this happened to one of your loved ones what just that impact might be. They're trying to process what is it that has taken place,"" Sheriff Doug Gillespie said about the victims' families. ""They have good support but it's going to be a difficult road -- two young families and their fathers are no longer there."" Joseph Wilcox, 31 . After the Millers shot the officers, they fled to a Walmart where Jerad Miller allegedly fired one round and told everyone to get out. Wilcox, who was in the store and who was carrying a concealed weapon, moved to confront the shooter. But he didn't realize Jerad Miller was not alone. Authorities say Amanda Miller shot Wilcox, killing him. ""Joseph died attempting to protect others. His death is completely senseless,"" Sheriff Gillespie told reporters. Wilcox's sister, CJ Foster, said her brother was pro-gun and believed guns don't kill people -- people kill people. ""He did a very brave thing and I'm very proud of him. I'm proud to call him my brother,"" she said. Jeremy Tanner, a friend, was with Wilcox at the Walmart before the shooting started. ""Joseph had the option to go left and exit the store to safety, but he instead went into the store and chased after the gunman,"" he told CNN. ""I wanted to tell him: 'Don't do this. Come with me.' But I also felt that he's possibly going to be saving some lives.""

"(CNN) -- When I was just 3 months old, I was smuggled by my aunt into the United States. I was born in Jerez, Zacatecas, Mexico. Only three months separated me from being a U.S. citizen. Three small months that could have completely changed my life. Growing up in a town near Los Angeles, which is predominantly Hispanic, I always fit in. I never thought about race until I got to middle school. That's the first time I remember being called ""Huero"" and ""white boy"" because of my light skin and green eyes. I knew my family was Mexican, but part of me was embarrassed. My parents didn't speak English, so I avoided having conversations with them in front of my friends. I was ""too cool"" to be associated with being Hispanic. I was lost in my culture. Now I know this was the case with lots of my friends -- we were all searching to fit in. It's in part because of the way the American culture has brought us up. There were two classes at my middle school: ""Americanized"" Hispanics and ""beaner"" Hispanics. If you were dark-skinned and didn't speak English well, you were called a ""beaner"" and a border-hopper. You would be seen as ""uncool"" or an ""outsider."" In gym class, some of the better soccer players were called ""beaners."" It was Hispanics being racist toward other Hispanics. I was one of those people who wanted to be associated with the more ""American"" kids, so I always went along with it as I entered high school. I tried to be like my friends as much as possible. They were second- or third-generation Mexicans who spoke English at school and hung out with the white kids. I dressed like the Americans who wore skater shoes, baggy pants and Billabong T-shirts. And even though I loved soccer, I thought it was too Mexican, so I played football instead. Sadly, distancing yourself from your home culture was considered the norm. I fully regret it and wish I never had a part in it. Share your personal essays with CNN iReport . Freshman year is when I first found out I was undocumented. I was waiting at registration and when the clerk was going through my paperwork, she asked if I knew my Social Security number. I told her I'd get it from my mom later. When I got home, my parents had told me about my ""story."" I remember feeling ashamed of myself, that I was one of them, a ""beaner."" I mean how could someone like me, someone who looks white, be an undocumented immigrant? I always thought undocumented immigrants were working the farms and not speaking English. It's bad to say, but that was my vision of what an undocumented immigrant was. I always felt like I was too good to be an undocumented immigrant. I spoke perfect English. I got good grades in high school. I played sports. I was your typical American kid. I couldn't help but wonder: Why is that one piece of paper stopping me from saying I'm an American? From that point on, my life changed. I realized that I would not be getting my driver's license at 16. I would not be getting a summer job to make money. Throughout high school, I was always careful about what I said in my circle of friends. When my friends would talk about going on vacations to other countries, I would feel so left out. I hated hearing them because it would bring me down. I wished that I had been born here. I wish I had been a U.S. citizen. But you can either dwell on it or deal with it. I chose the latter. At 17, I got my first job working at a video store. It helped me feel more ""normal"" and more ""American,"" even though I still couldn't legally drive. After I graduated, I started driving without a license. I had no choice; I had to get to work and school. When most people my age were excited to drive, I felt the opposite. Every time I was behind the wheel, I had a constant fear of being pulled over. Yes there was some excitement, but that quickly faded when I realized the risks I ran. Being pulled over meant a ticket, my car being towed, and money to fix it all. When I was 21, I got into a minor accident where I made a small dent on an older man's car. When I pulled over, I just remember wanting to disappear or die. My heart sank and I was scared out of my mind. I called my dad, who came over quickly with my uncle. As I waited, the man insulted me. When he learned I had no license he flipped, cursing me and calling me every name in the book. After that accident I was even more cautious when I drove. Vargas: Undocumented and hiding in plain sight . In my early 20s, I stopped caring about who knew I was undocumented. It's not like something I chose. It's not like it made me un-American. I told three of my closest friends about it and they could not believe what I was telling them. They couldn't believe that someone like me, who looks so white, could be an undocumented immigrant. Now I'm 25, and I have learned a lot. I come from a beautiful culture of people who are full of tradition and I am proud of it. To this day, I'm still asked what ethnicity I am. When I tell them I'm Mexican, they just look at me in confusion and ask if I speak Spanish. When I respond in Spanish, the look on their faces is just priceless. After President Barack Obama signed an executive order in 2012 allowing children who had entered the country illegally to remain and work, I applied for relief from deportation. It took a couple of months, but in December 2012, I got the good news. I couldn't help but think about all of the possibilities that could come, like getting a good job and a driver's license. But it was bittersweet. I still wish I had a way to travel outside of the United States. I know the first place I would visit: I'd go to Mexico. Opinion: The undocumented are us .

"(EW.com) -- Rapper, entrepreneur, actor, and investor Curtis James Jackson III, better known by his stage name 50 Cent, can add a new credit to his bio: God-awful pitcher. The Queens-born rapper threw the first pitch at a Mets game last week, and missed, terribly. We mean really terribly. Really, really terribly. The Internet quickly responded, dubbing Fiddy's misstep one of the worst pitches ever, if not the worst. In fact, the pitch was so bad that Jackson, known for hits like ""Candy Shop"" and ""In Da Club,"" told Good Morning America that a cop pulled him over just to tell him, ""You know that pitch was really terrible."" Then, he let him go. No ticket, just a laugh. Is Jackson's whiff really as bad as Carly Rae Jepsen, Carl Lewis, or Mariah Carey's attempts at first-pitchdom? Maybe not, but his explanation certainly was. In a Reddit AMA on Tuesday, a user asked, ""Yo $0.50...what happened on that first pitch?"" His response: ""I have skeletal muscle injury on my left shoulder from excessive masturbation so take it easy lol."" He has to be kidding, right? You be the judge.

"Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- The U.S. Embassy in Uganda said that it had been warned of a ""specific threat"" Thursday evening against Entebbe International Airport near the Ugandan capital, Kampala. An embassy statement, which said the warning came from Ugandan police, based on intelligence sources, said the threat involved an unknown terrorist group. ""Individuals planning travel through the airport this evening may want to review their plans in light of this information,"" it said. The warning comes a day after the Obama administration said it was stepping up security for some flights headed to the United States from Europe and the Middle East, reflecting heightened concern that terrorists are developing more sophisticated bombs designed to avoid airport screening. Specific steps and airports were not disclosed. A homeland security official said the Transportation Security Administration would work with airlines and security agencies overseas and that the changes would primarily focus on airports in Europe and the Middle East. The effort does not involve changes to what travelers can take aboard flights. But passengers may see additional inspections of shoes and electronics, additional use of scanners designed to detect trace amounts of explosives, and another stage of screening at boarding gates, in some cases, the official said. The changes came about based on new intelligence on terror groups trying to build new types of improvised explosives that are harder to detect, the official told CNN. There was no specific plot. Earlier this week, CNN reported the United States was considering new airport security measures because of concerns that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was working on undetectable explosives. Tighter security ordered for some U.S.-bound flights . Streets awash with troops . Security was stepped up Thursday on the road to Entebbe, some 26 miles (42 kilometers) outside the capital and the country's only international airport. Kampala Metropolitan Police spokesman Patrick Onyango said the heightened police presence, backed up by the army, was in response to the potential airport terror threat as well as security concerns around the soccer World Cup and international events taking place in Uganda. Departing travelers appeared to undergo detailed screening by anti-terrorism police and other security agents as they entered Entebbe airport; while those arriving said the security process took longer than usual. ""It is unusual out there,"" said Jonathan Kikonde, an engineer and regular traveler through Entebbe who arrived at lunchtime. ""We have been subjected to a screening of both the body and luggage."" Residents also saw a heightened military and police presence Thursday on Lake Victoria, on whose shores the airport sits. ""We have been told by police authorities that terrorists are capable of targeting them at the crowded fish landing sites and piers for ferries and boats that transport people to the islands,"" said Bruhan Kyeswa, a fishmonger at Nkiwogo landing site, the nearest to Entebbe airport. In Kampala itself, the streets were awash with heavily armed troops, their presence concentrated around busy points like malls, bus stations and markets. Kampala Metropolitan Police commander Felix Kaweesi said by phone: ""We have got information from cross-border security that terrorists are already here (in Uganda) building cells."" The U.S. Embassy in Uganda reminded U.S. citizens of ""the continued threat of potential terrorist attacks in the country,"" particularly in crowded public places such as hotels, restaurants, malls and transportation hubs. 'As few disruptions' as possible . Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a statement Wednesday that he had directed the TSA to ""implement enhanced security measures in the coming days"" at selected overseas airports. ""We will work to ensure these necessary steps pose as few disruptions to travelers as possible,"" Johnson said. The measures do not involve U.S. domestic flights, and passengers could see changes as early as next week. The UK Department for Transport confirmed Wednesday that it is also stepping up some of its aviation security measures. It said that most passengers should not experience ""significant disruption."" Since hardening cockpit doors and taking other measures after the 9/11 al Qaeda attacks, the U.S. aviation security focus has shifted primarily from hijackings to plastic and other explosives that can be carried aboard a plane or hidden in baggage. The United States has particularly been focused on efforts by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to develop undetectable explosives since the unsuccessful attempt by the so-called underwear bomber to bring down a Delta Air Lines jet over Detroit in 2009. Journalist Samson Ntale reported from Kampala, while CNN's Barbara Starr reported from Washington and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.

"(CNN) -- Ayman al-Zawahiri's coronation as the king of al Qaeda came with some anxiety over another major attack and a barrage of questions about the future of the terror network. Since 1998, al-Zawahiri had been Osama bin Laden's personal physician and one of his closest confidants, a steadfast deputy who eulogized his boss after his death last month in Pakistan. But it took this many weeks for an al Qaeda announcement on its new leader, and that suggested to some analysts that there had been head-bashing over who should take the helm. ""It doesn't suggest a vast reservoir of accumulated goodwill for him,"" said Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst. When the founder and leader of any organization dies, it's a challenge to thrive. In al Qaeda's case, the road ahead is lined with major bumps, especially for its newly anointed leader. Weakened in recent years, al Qaeda has been losing a critical war of ideas and now faces another hurdle in the Arab Spring, Bergen said. ""They are two big nails in the coffin,"" he said. Al-Zawahiri will have to overcome al Qaeda's troubles in spite of his personal shortcomings. For starters, he lacks the charisma and oratory of his former boss. ""He wants to inspire people, not just who are joining the al Qaeda organization, but people who have never joined the al Qaeda organization and are trying to launch attacks in their name,"" said Paul Cruickshank, a CNN terrorism analyst. ""Without bin Laden there anymore, they won't be as inspired. There are others in the organization, like American-born Yemeni cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who were unlikely contenders but might have made a better choice. Al-Awlaki speaks English, is tech-savvy and might have been one to re-energize the network with a boost or morale and fresh recruits at a time when many believe al Qaeda's influence is waning. And Saif al-Adel, a former Egyptian army lieutenant and long-time Islamist, was appointed the interim leader of al Qaeda after bin Laden's death. But Bergen said al-Adel, sort of the defense minister for al Qaeda, has never been a public face for the group. He is widely believed to be managing insurgent paramilitary operations in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. There are also reports describing al-Zawahiri as a prickly man who can be argumentative, divisive and difficult to work with. He has been accused of being a micro-manager who is not a true ideologue in the vein of bin Laden. These are all qualities that do not bode well for an organization that has to re-energize itself in order to survive, analysts said. ""Very poorly respected,"" said former CIA Officer Phil Mudd. ""He is seen as a difficult man to work with. He has no sense among the work force in al Qaeda, the kind of prestige that bin Laden had."" But as it were, al Qaeda's central command came together and talked it out until they agreed on al-Zawahiri, said Bill Roggio, military affairs analyst who is managing editor of The Long War Journal. ""He has been a very public official. He's very well known in the rank and file,"" Roggio said. ""There's a lot of questions on how he's perceived in the ranks, but even bin Laden had his detractors."" But ultimately, Roggio said, al Qaeda closes ranks, and the group is likely to operate in a business-as-usual mode. ""Under his leadership, there really won't be that many changes,"" said Mark Baker, who worked for 17 years in counterterrorism at the CIA. ""It's not like a corporate shakeup."" There hasn't been a successful major attack on the West since the London bombings in 2005, and experts were divided over whether al-Zawahiri will try to cement his throne with a dastardly act. Sajjan Gohel, director of international security for the London-based counterterrorism think tank Asia-Pacific Foundation, said al-Zawahiri will have to figure out how to unite the myriad factions of al Qaeda and deal with an operational space that has been confining due to U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan. The organization is also suffering financially, Gohel said. ""He needs to do something to keep al Qaeda relevant in a very difficult scenario,"" Gohel said. The biggest challenge may be how to gain back ideological ground in a time when pro-democracy movements are blossoming in northern Africa and the Middle East. Al Qaeda has been opportunistic in claiming that the mass demonstrations fly in the face of Western powers, but in reality, Bergen said, the group has been rendered irrelevant in the events reverberating through the region. ""If you have freedom, al Qaeda will go away,"" former Egyptian jihadist Osama Rushdi said in February. Roggio said that had bin Laden been killed shortly after the September 11 attacks, al-Zawahiri would have been taking over a less mature organization and might have had a more difficult time moving it forward. But 10 years after those devastating attacks, al Qaeda is well-established, Roggio said. It matters less who is in charge because the middle managers -- the bomb-makers, the men on the streets making the operations decisions -- are entrenched in their jobs. How important al Qaeda's top job is remains to be seen. ""But it is far more established and networked today than it was,"" Roggio said. Still, al-Zawhiri may not fit that easily into bin Laden's shoes. He also takes charge after a series of recent captures and kills of al Qaeda leaders: Among them were Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, the most-wanted terrorist in Africa, and Ilyas Kashmiri in Pakistan. ""Between the drone program, losing the war of ideas, their relevance, the bench depleted by captures or kills, the lack of success of attacks on the West -- all these things don't suggest a great deal of strength for al Qaeda,"" Bergen said. ""That's the problem set al-Zawahiri inherits.""","It took many weeks for al Qaeda to announce its new leader .
That could be sign of disagreement over al-Zawahiri .
Al Qaeda is losing the war of ideas .
Al-Zawahiri lacks the charisma and oratory of Osama bin Laden ."
"Tokyo (CNN) -- The battle continued Monday to plug a crack at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power facility that's been a conduit for highly radioactive water leaking into the Pacific Ocean, utility company officials said. On Sunday, the workers poured a chemical compound mixed with sawdust and newspaper into the crack, hoping it would expand and stick.  But so far it has not done the trick, according to officials with the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates the plant. The effort followed an attempt Saturday to use concrete to plug the the 2-meter-deep (6.5-foot-deep), concrete-lined basin, where authorities had found water gushing directly into the sea via a roughly 20-centimeter (8-inch) crack. The cracked shaft sits behind the No. 2 reactor's turbine building at the facility, which has been in constant crisis since the failure of cooling systems and numerous explosions in the wake of last month's epic earthquake and tsunami. Fixing the problem quickly is critical because officials believe it is one source of alarmingly high levels of radiation spotted in seawater near the plant. This is all part of a massive, many weekslong effort to contain the amount of toxic material leaking into the air, ground and water. On Monday, a Tokyo Electric spokesman said the idea of wrapping some or all of the plant's six reactors containment buildings in massive amounts of sheeting, in order to curb the release of radiation had been discussed in recent talks with government officials. The utility company is considering the concept, according to the spokesman. In the meantime, authorities are still trying to determine how harmful the radiation levels are currently around the plant. After some high-profile errors while offering regular radiation measurements on seawater, groundwater and the air, little such new information has been released since Thursday. One part of the problem, including in the concrete shaft from which the highly radioactive water is leaking directly into the sea, is the fact that dosimeters being used don't go higher than 1,000 millisieverts per hour, Tokyo Electric executive Junichi Matsumoto told reporters Sunday. Authorities know the water is emitting at least that much radiation, which alone is more than 330 times the dose an average resident of an industrialized country naturally receives in a year. Above the shaft, the level was 250 millisieverts per hour. The shaft lies at the end of a long channel that has been filling up for days. Last Thursday, samples of seawater taken 330 meters (361 yards) offshore were said to have levels of iodine-131 at 4,385 times above the standard and cesium-137 at 527 times beyond normal. Experts say the latter radioactive isotope may be a greater concern because it persists longer, taking 30 years to lose half its radiation -- compared to an eight-day half-life for the iodine-131 isotope. Plugging the external leak is job one, in order to prevent the outflow of radiation into the Pacific. But it may not be the most difficult, or important, task ahead. Authorities still have to figure out how the tainted water got into the concrete shaft in the first place. The water had to come from somewhere, potentially traveling across melted-down nuclear fuel in the reactor's core before somehow reaching the outside. Hidehiko Nishiyama, an official with Japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency, said Sunday that the working theory is that water injected in recent weeks into the No. 2 reactor to help cool its nuclear fuel rods somehow got out. ""We were assuming and hoping (that water) would stay in the containment vessel as vapor after being cooled,"" he said. ""However, it may have flowed into the building, and then the trench."" Finding out why and how that happened -- and, more so, what to do about it -- promises to be ""exceptionally challenging,"" said physicist James Acton, with the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment think tank. To do so, officials must inspect a complicated array of pipes inside the dangerous radioactive environment that now exists within the containment building, according to Acton. He is familiar with Japanese nuclear plants in part from having examined one rocked by a 6.8-magnitude earthquake in 2007. This struggle is part of the larger, daunting challenge facing Tokyo Electric and Japanese officials as they come to grips with the scope of the disaster and work feverishly to keep nuclear fuel cool and prevent the further release of dangerously radioactive material. General Electric Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt, who also chairs U.S. President Barack Obama's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness,  was in Tokyo on Sunday meeting with Tokyo Electric officials. Several of the Fukushima Daiichi plant's reactors were designed by GE and built in a joint venture with Hitachi. Matsumoto, the Tokyo Electric executive, said Immelt and the utility's officials discussed the crisis and how to meet summer's peak demands with two of its nuclear plants offline: the Fukushima Daiichi facility and the Fukushima Daiini nuclear plant, which is in the same prefecture. A power company official announced Sunday that two workers missing since the 9.0-magnitude March 11 quake were found dead in the basement of the No. 4 reactor's turbine building. Both men, ages 21 and 24, appeared to have suffered multiple traumatic injuries. Their remains were found Wednesday. More than a dozen others have been reported injured over the past three weeks at the plant.  Most of their injuries were tied to explosions caused by the buildup of hydrogen in the Nos. 1 and 3 reactor complexes. Nishiyama said there is a plan to inject nonflammable nitrogen into the Nos. 1, 2 and 3 reactors to prevent another such hydrogen blast. A buildup of hydrogen is an early sign of damage to a reactor's superheated core. But Nishiyama said no alarms had been sounded about rising pressure and that adding nitrogen would not force engineers to release hydrogen from the reactors. All these difficulties notwithstanding, there has been good news recently on the nuclear front. Figures released this weekend by Japan's health and science ministries showed levels of radioactive iodine and cesium in vegetables tested in Fukushima and Niigata prefectures had fallen below legal limits. Still, there was no immediate indication that officials would lift restrictions on the sale and distribution of certain products from areas near the stricken plant, put in place after tests detected high radiation levels in some food. Also, a study done late last month on 946 children up to age 15 in several communities near the Fukushima Daiichi plant showed no evidence that they had ingested excessively high levels of radioactive iodine that's been pinpointed as a cause of thyroid cancer, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said Sunday. The Japanese minister also took pains to stress the crisis isn't over yet -- either at the power plant or within a 30-kilometer (18-mile) radius, where 78,000 people have been ordered to evacuate and another 62,000 told to at least stay indoors. ""The impact of the nuclear crisis is expected to go on for a long time,"" he said. ""(The evacuees, especially) are enduring an extremely difficult situation.""

"LONDON, England -- In his autobiography, Eric Clapton admits that he enjoys nothing more than sitting in a deck chair on a white sandy beach watching his children playing in the sea. Private getaway: Eric Clapton enjoys spending time relaxing on his superyacht Va Bene. It's the perfect antidote to a punishing tour schedule, and with gigs in the U.S., Canada, the UK, Scandinavia and Europe so far this year, getting away from it all is an experience he values. He found that he was particularly at ease aboard the 157 ft (47.8m) motor yacht Va Bene, which he chartered in 2005 and cruised with friends around the Mediterranean. The sheltered port of Bonifacio at the southern end of Corsica became one of his favorite haunts. In fact, Clapton enjoyed Va Bene so much that he bought her. It was the first time he'd ever had to borrow money to buy something, but he had fallen for the yacht, despite her 13 years and slightly dated looks. Besides there was always the possibility of updating her to give her a new lease of life. Va Bene came with an interesting pedigree. She had originally been commissioned by a Greek ship owner in 1992 to a design by Richard Hein (of Oceanco fame) and built by Kees Cornelissen in Holland. She was then purchased by F1 motor racing supremo Bernie Ecclestone before being sold to an American. A steel-hulled displacement yacht with a cruising speed of about 14 knots, Va Bene can accommodate 12 guests in six separate sleeping cabins and has a crew complement of 13. Having lived with Va Bene for a couple of years, Eric Clapton finally felt the time was right for a refit. Clapton was particularly keen for the work to be carried out in the UK, partly because he wanted to buy British but also because he could keep a close eye on proceedings. Pendennis Shipyard in Falmouth, Cornwall, was an obvious choice. Roger Taylor, the drummer with Queen has his yacht Tiger Lilly refitted regularly in Falmouth and Pete Townsend of the Who is another famous client. Pendennis Shipyard representative Alastair Heane was first introduced to the yacht during the charter show in Antigua in December 2006. Eric Clapton has a house on the island and Va Bene is based here during the winter season. Heane quickly established a detailed proposal of work. The plan was to get Va Bene to Falmouth after Clapton had finished his 2007 summer holiday so that the work could be carried out during the winter. The initial time frame was three months but like most complex refits this quickly extended to six as the work list grew. The target was to have Va Bene ready and waiting in Porto Cervo Sardinia on July 1 this year in time for Eric Clapton's month-long family holiday -- a date that was set in stone to fit around his tour schedule. We caught up with Va Bene during a photo shoot at the end of June 2008 on the very day she was setting sail from Palma, Mallorca, to meet up with the boss in Sardinia. With the final last-minute touches still being applied and the crew busily unpacking everything from the owner's precious guitar to his children's cuddly toys, it was a close run thing but Pendennis had met the deadline in style. The first thing that strikes you on boarding Va Bene is the calm, informal atmosphere of what is clearly a much-loved family yacht rather than a glitzy monument to success. Eric Clapton may be one of the world's greatest living rock stars but he is also an unpretentious family man who wants a yacht that he can relax on. The saloon encapsulates this perfectly. Rather than a single formal space with designer furniture that look so immaculate you hardly dare sit down, Va Bene's saloon is divided into four separate areas with clusters of contrasting chairs, sofas, tables and cabinets. One group of guests can be relaxing round the card table and matching leather chairs, while others stretch out on the big taupe corduroy sofa to watch a movie. That still leaves room for him to sneak off into another corner and perch on one of the special armless low-level chairs to play his guitar. The adjacent dining room is a little more formal but even here the overriding feeling is of a wonderfully light room centered around what looks like a huge limed-oak table inlaid with Italian marble. In fact, it is all the handiwork of a talented local artisan who painted the surface of the original table to match the materials found elsewhere on the yacht right down to the fake wooden joints and natural marble flaws. This solution appealed both to Clapton's desire to refresh rather than replace where possible and his appreciation of skilled craftsmanship. He is a keen collector of modern art himself and every spare wall and surface reflects this passion. From intricate postcard-sized oil paintings of Venice to large, sprawling canvases and some beautiful marble sculptures and ceramic vases, it is a collection that reflects the singer's own ability to transcend the confines of any one genre. Perhaps that also explains the relatively neutral tones of the décor. There is an Art Deco theme running through the main guest areas, which the refit has refreshed and modernized rather dispensed with. The limed-oak paneling is original but all the garish gold door handles, light fittings and switches have either been replaced or replated in chrome to give it a much more contemporary feel. The high gloss white painted ceiling panels and moldings have all been meticulously flatted back to leave a softer matt finish while all the ceiling lights, some 400 of them in total, have been replaced with modern recessed spots. As you'd expect aboard a musician's yacht, the AV system was another major beneficiary of the refit. Every cabin and guest space now has a discreet Arcam iPod dock so that he can plug in his iPhone wherever he is and enjoy instant access to his personal music library. All bar one of the existing Bang & Olufsen CRT televisions have also been swapped for high-definition Panasonic Viera flat screens. The highlight of the refit is the new owner's suite on the main deck -- a space that Clapton and his wife rarely used before the refit, because it is at the opposite end of the yacht to his children's cabins. (They preferred the smaller but more family-friendly location of the VIP guest suite next to the main run of cabins on the lower deck.) But it's a much more enticing space these days. Reconfigured by interior designers H2 in Putney, London, it now enjoys a much bigger family bathroom complete with walk-in rain shower, dramatic stone basins, a large tub and a natural teak floor. The key to the success of the refit, which cost in excess of US$4 million, lay in the planning. Pendennis's Tyrone Harvey and a small team started with a technical visit to the yacht in Palma, Mallorca, in the early summer of last year. Within days of arriving in Falmouth Va Bene had undergone sea trials with Duncan Propellers to try and improve an ongoing issue with her performance and economy. It eventually transpired that one of the gearboxes had been incorrectly fitted. She was then moored alongside at Pendennis while her crew started the long job of removing her entire inventory. She also had her teak deck stripped off before she was floated into the 150m long dry dock. Despite all the changes, Va Bene left Falmouth on time, arriving in Sardinia on July 1. Indeed, it was during this holiday that Eric Clapton took time out to talk to SuperYacht World about his born-again Va Bene (see p74). Now that he has had a chance to enjoy the fruits of his and Pendennis's labor, Va Bene is available for charter through Burgess Yachts in the Mediterranean and Caribbean. It's not often you get to walk in the shadow of a genuine rock legend but on Va Bene you can also swim, sunbathe and sleep in Eric Clapton's personal holiday home. Chartering just doesn't get any better than that. Subscribe to SuperYachtWorld . COPYRIGHT ©  2009 IPC MEDIA LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED .","Eric Clapton owns the 48 meter superyacht Va Bene .

"(CNN) -- The West Georgia University graduate student infected two weeks ago with a rare ""flesh-eating"" bacteria was making progress, albeit slowly, her father said Tuesday. ""She was in high spirits,"" Andy Copeland told CNN about his daughter, Aimee Copeland, 24, who was on a ventilator in intensive care at Doctors Hospital in Augusta, Georgia. ""She appears to be remembering day-to-day different conversations we've had. We actually referred to some conversations she had yesterday, so her memory is -- short-term memory -- appears to be coming back, which is a very encouraging sign."" As a result of the damage done by the bacterial infection called necrotizing fasciitis, doctors have removed part of Copeland's abdomen, amputated a leg and expect to remove her fingers, her father said on a website run by the University of West Georgia Psychology Department. ""However, physicians have hope of bringing life back to the palms of her hands, which could allow her the muscle control to use helpful prosthetics,"" he said. ""They are awaiting a safe time before embarking on surgery for this."" Copeland, who has been on life support since May 4, regained consciousness a week later, according to the school's website. The master's student in psychology at the school was with friends on May 1 near the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta, when she grabbed onto a zip line. It snapped and she fell. The accident left a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close. Three days later, still in pain, she went to an emergency room, where doctors determined she had contracted the flesh-devouring bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila. She was taken to Augusta for surgery. But, as of Tuesday night, she had not yet fully grasped the extent of her illness, her father said. ""As far as all the specifics, we steered her away from the experience itself. To me, it probably does not good in her healing process to bring up any bad memories, at this point."" Bored with television, his daughter was reading and trying to communicate with her family, the father said on the website. But the ventilator made talking difficult, he said. ""Some of the simplest words can take minutes to decipher when you have a tube interfering with your lips and movement of your jaw."" For example, he added, ""lamb chop"" turned out to be ""laptop."" Copeland has been infused with 177 units of blood since she contracted the infection. That's more than 168 pints; the average human body contains about 10 pints of blood, according to America's Blood Centers. ""You've got a lot of need,"" the father said. ""We've got blood drives in Augusta, Carrollton, Winder, Lawrenceville, Snellville,"" he added, referring to communities in Georgia. The bacteria are ""remarkably common in the water and in the environment,"" according to Dr. Buddy Creech, an assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University.

"Houston (CNN) -- Alexander Reyes' boyhood dream of a military career ended when he was hit by an improvised explosive device during a patrol a few years ago in Baghdad. ""Laying in that hospital bed ... sometimes I felt I'd rather (have) died,"" Reyes said. ""My life came to a complete halt."" Reyes sustained severe blast injuries that led to his medical discharge and put him on medical disability. Like many soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, he found the transition to civilian life difficult. But he and a handful of other injured veterans have gotten help from what may seem an unlikely source: a custom homebuilder in Houston, Texas. Dan Wallrath presented Reyes and his wife with an unexpected gift: a home built especially for them, mortgage-free. ""Thank you. That's all I can say,"" Elizabeth Reyes said, sobbing and clutching her stunned husband's arm when Wallrath surprised them with the house. For Wallrath, a 2010 CNN Hero, giving wounded veterans a place to call home is his way of saying thanks. Since 2005, his organization has built 44 houses through a national campaign called Operation Finally Home. Wallrath spent 30 years making upscale clients' dream houses a reality. But he found a new mission in 2005 when he met with Steve Schulz about a very different type of project. Schulz's 20-year old son, a U.S. Marine, had been seriously injured in Iraq. Schulz desperately needed to remodel his house to accommodate his son's wheelchair. ""I had no idea how I was going to pay for it,"" Schulz said. ""I just knew that I had to get it done."" As a favor to a friend, Wallrath went to advise Schulz on remodeling his house. It was a meeting that changed Wallrath's life. He remembers Schulz showing him photos of his son Steven. ""He was a big, strapping Marine,"" Wallrath said. But the pictures he saw of Steven taken after his injury told a different story. ""He was ... half his size. It was so sad,"" he said. ""It dawned on me that people are facing this all over the U.S."" Wallrath mobilized an army of carpenters, plumbers and suppliers who took on the remodeling job for free. They widened doorways, built a ramp to the back door and made the bathroom more accessible. ""Anything that needed to be done, Dan said, 'We'll take care of it,' "" Schulz recalled. ""It was just a huge, huge relief."" When the work on Schulz's home was complete, Wallrath realized he was just getting started. ""It really broke my heart to think (about) these young men and women,"" he said. He decided the best way he could help wounded veterans was by doing what he knew best: building them homes. ""It was like someone hit me upside the head with a 2x4. ... I just felt like this is what God wants me to do."" Wallrath took his idea to his local trade group, the Bay Area Builders Association, and convinced members to start a homebuilding program for wounded veterans. With donations from suppliers and contractors, Wallrath said, the group can build a $250,000 house for about $75,000. Each house is customized -- and often fully furnished -- to meet the needs of each family, and they are mortgage-free. The group also covers taxes and insurance for one year. Wounded veterans or their spouses often have to find a new career or go back to school, making it hard to make ends meet, Wallrath said. ""If you can alleviate a financial burden off these young kids where they can concentrate on rebuilding their lives, you can really make a difference,"" he said. Lt. Erasmo Valles is one such story. As a Marine, he was injured by an IED in Iraq in 2004 and ultimately had one of his legs amputated. Returning to civilian life was hard, and his family rapidly burned through its savings. ""We'd saved money for rainy days, but ... it was raining,"" Valles said. Receiving a home from Wallrath in November 2008 turned their fortunes around. Valles started studying for his doctorate in public safety; his wife earned her master's degree and became a special education teacher. ""It saved us,"" he said. ""We're moving on and moving forward. ... For someone to think about me and my family ... to build a home -- wow. That's a hero."" Wallrath is determined to help as many families as he can. His group has enlisted builders and builders' associations in 17 states to join his crusade. The group has 42 homes under construction, with the goal of building 50-60 more next year. Considering the industry was hard-hit by the recession, Wallrath says he's been heartened by the response. Now retired, Wallrath dedicates most of his time to this effort without pay. He says it's the least he can do to repay some of the more than 50,000 troops who've been wounded in Afghanistan and Iraq. ""These kids ... they're doing it for me and you,"" he said. ""So we're the ones that need to step up and do something."" Want to get involved?

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A year ago, China's new generation of leaders strode out onto a stage in the cavernous Great Hall of the People in Beijing. They were led by Xi Jinping, who took over from Hu Jintao as head of the Chinese Communist Party, which has ruled China for more than 60 years. CNN asked three analysts for their verdict on Xi's first year at China's helm in three key areas: Domestic politics, the environment and the economy. Domestic politics: A fiery start . Cheng Li is director of research and a senior fellow at Brookings Institution's John L. Thornton China Center. The Chinese saying ""A new leader lights three bonfires"" vividly captures the momentum and accomplishments of Xi's first year as party boss. Each of these ""three bonfires"" ---- the vigorous anti-corruption campaign, the successful conclusion of thetrial of disgraced politician Bo Xilai, and the comprehensive and deeper market reforms embraced at the third plenum -- have granted him much needed public support and significantly consolidated his power. From the first day of his tenure as general secretary of the Party, he admitted to the public that the rampancy of official corruption was ruining the Party and the country. With Wang Qishan, his most important political ally in the Politburo Standing Committee, Xi launched a tough anti-corruption campaign. Within a year, 11 ministerial and provincial-level senior leaders were arrested, including leaders within the country's most formidable special interest groups like the oil industry. Some critics may be cynical about the methods employed in the anti-corruption campaign, but the campaign has already transformed the behavior of Chinese officials. Xi should be credited with the successful completion of the Bo trial, which was the largest legitimacy crisis for the Party since the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident and widely perceived to be a ""no-win"" situation for the Party leadership. The scandal revealed the fact that some high-ranking Party leaders like Bo -- China's Gatsby -- have decadent lifestyles filled with sex, money laundering, and even murder. Xi and his colleagues handled the case wisely in three aspects: . First, they focused on Bo's corruption, not on his other unlawful behavior. Second, they used social media micro-blogging to disseminate the details of the courtroom proceedings, thus undermining criticism of lack of openness. And third, Bo's verdict of life imprisonment seemed to be appropriate, neither too severe nor too lenient. Most importantly, Xi wants to leave a strong mark on the economic front. He has embraced as his mandate the ""Chinese dream,"" defined as the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the opportunity to realize a middle-class lifestyle. The overall objective of his new economic policy, as evident from the third plenum, is to make the private sector the ""decisive driver"" of the Chinese economy, to make the Chinese middle class happy, and to allow more members of the lower class to attain middle class status. While Xi's above three bonfires have resonated well among the general public, there are some valid worries about Xi and his rapidly growing power. Xi's politically conservative -- and sometimes even Mao-style -- approach that has relied on tight political control and media censorship has alienated the country's liberal intellectuals. His broad and strong anti-corruption campaign may also alienate a large number of officials -- the very power base on which the Party relies. The environment: Promises but few results . Isabel Hilton is the founder and editor of www.chinadialogue.net, a bilingual Chinese English website devoted to building a shared approach on climate change and environmental issues with China. She graduated from the University of Edinburgh with an honors MA in Chinese, and in 1973 was one of the first British students to study in China. There was not much cheer for environmentalists in the meeting that was billed as the most significant of Xi Jinping's administration. At the close of the Chinese Communist Party's Third Plenum on November 13, China's official news agency, Xinhua, failed even to list the environment among its key points, focusing instead on the promise of economic reform. Xi has recognized that prioritizing economic growth for 30 years has brought China to the edge of environmental collapse and he has promised to give environment the same weight as economic development. But 2013 was a year of dramatically worsening air pollution and mounting public frustration at the government's apparent inability to halt China's deforestation, maritime pollution, desertification and water and soil pollution. Xi said China must build what it calls ""ecological civilization"" -- a top-level slogan that officials are still struggling to flesh out. He talked of ""establishing a complete system"" of ecological civilization, promised to improve the management of natural resources, and to establish ""red lines"" in ecological protection, along with ecological compensation for pollution victims. It is how these and other promises shape up that will decide Xi's environmental legacy. So far, his government has announced plans to clean up lethal air pollution but they will take many years to take effect. In other respects, environmental protection risks clashing with other concerns: a new Environmental Protection Law that is moving slowly through China's parliament threatens serious financial penalties for polluting companies, but has also been heavily criticized for restricting the rights of NGOs to take legal action against polluters, as Xi tightens the state's control of civil society. It also plays a role in the rising incidence of protest and chronic rural poverty, which President Xi has promised to reverse. The environment could benefit from Xi's commitment to a greater role for the market, which might boost China's pilot carbon-trading schemes, and from his promise of a stronger legal system and greater transparency. High-level promises set the policy direction, but Xi's environmental record will be judged by results. Key issues include cleaning up China's Environmental Impact Assessments, boosting the Ministry of Environmental Protection and putting it in charge of the provincial and local bureaus, building a robust, legally enforced system of fines for polluters and lifting restrictions on China's tightly controlled environmental NGOs. The economy: Welcome shift . Louis Kuijs is Chief China Economist at Royal Bank of Scotland and a former IMF and World Bank economist. Under the new leadership, we have seen a welcome shift towards a more comprehensive approach to reform. This was underlined by the decisions made during last week's Plenum to recalibrate the role of the government, with less direct intervention and more facilitation of the market and provision of public services. We have also witnessed a move towards more emphasis on the sustainability and quality of growth, as opposed to simply the rate of growth. During the slowdown that China went through until the middle of this year, the leadership was more restrained than previously in rolling out stimulus measures, emphasizing that reform is more important than short-term stimulus. In a similar vein, the leadership is trying to put more emphasis on improving the quality of urbanization -- basically by allowing migrants to integrate into a proper urban life -- and the reforms needed to make that happen in areas such as the fiscal system and rural land arrangements. In spite of the arrival of new people at the top, the politics of reform in China's consensus-driven policymaking process has not changed. For instance, in the case of reforms related to state-run enterprises and the fiscal system, resistance remains as strong as ever. This has meant that progress on such reforms has been slow so far although, in a promising move, the leadership is now trying to overcome such political obstacles by introducing a ""leading group"" with a mandate to coordinate and push the reform agenda. All in all, on the economic front the new leadership has made a reasonably promising start. In the coming two years, I would expect to see pretty good progress on reform in those areas where the political economy is favorable, which is the case in the financial and monetary area, as well as on pricing and taxation of resources. On the other hand, in the areas of state-owned enterprises, fiscal reform and rural land arrangements, I would expect progress to remain slower in the coming two years.","Xi Jinping took power one year ago, becoming head of the Chinese Communist Party .

"(CNN) -- The president of an advertising firm that lost a $25 million contract to create a marketing campaign promoting the Jersey Shore told CNN Tuesday that the evaluation committee asked her team whether they would be comfortable featuring New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the ads. The news comes as federal investigators are looking into whether Christie improperly used some of that money to produce tourism ads that featured him and his family while he ran for re-election. The New Jersey ad agency Sigma Group had the lowest bid on labor and markup costs but lost the contract to a firm charging about $2 million more. Sigma Group President Shannon Morris told CNN that her team was asked during the pitch meeting ""if we would be open to featuring Chris Christie in the ads."" ""We didn't want to commit one way or the other. We were confident in the creative direction that we had presented. Our opinion was that maybe they knew something we didn't about the requirement or maybe they felt strongly for one reason or another that he should be included,"" she said. ""We also wanted to stand behind the work that we had submitted that didn't feature the governor or any other celebrity."" It turns out that the committee evaluating the proposals is made up entirely of people who work for the Christie administration. And perhaps the most controversial of the members is Michele Brown, the chief executive of the state's Economic Development Authority. She's one of the six voting members on the evaluation committee and has a long history with Christie. When Christie was U.S. attorney, Brown was a prosecutor. She resigned after revelations that Christie had given her a $46,000 loan in 2007 and had not reported it. After resigning, Brown went into private law practice, but in 2012, Christie named her to her current post. CNN was not able to reach Brown for comment. The other voting members are also tied to Christie. Two work with Brown at the Economic Development Authority. Another is chief of staff to Christie's lieutenant governor. And the two others are representatives from the community affairs and treasury departments, all of which ultimately answer to Christie. Some critics slammed Christie over the summer for starring in taxpayer-funded ads as he was running for re-election in November, arguing it gave him an unfair advantage. But others argued that he was the face of the Sandy recovery, so it made sense to put him in the ads. On Tuesday, the office the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development inspector general issued a statement about the inquiry, first reported by CNN, that said it had begun an audit in September ""to examine whether the State administered its Tourism Marketing Program in accordance with applicable departmental and Federal requirements."" The inspector general also said, ""This is an audit and not an investigation of the procurement process."" The inspector general uses the term ""investigation"" to denote a law enforcement probe.","Firm with lowest bid for post-Sandy campaign was asked about using Gov. Chris Christie, it says .

"(CNN) -- Extensive traveling is something that comes with the job for Dimitri Panayotopoulos. Over the last few weeks, the vice president of Procter & Gamble's global business units has flown to every continent, minus Antarctica, overseeing the consumer giant's operations across the world. His round-the-globe trips included a stop in South Africa, where he announced an investment of about $170 million to create a new manufacturing hub for the consumer goods giant's markets in Southern and East Africa. The new P&G plant, which is expected to create over 500 jobs, will manufacture a range of products, including detergents and feminine hygiene goods, for local and export markets. Construction is set to begin next year while operations are expected to commence in 2016 or early 2017. Read this: 'Africa's tallest building' set for $10 billion tech city . The investment comes as part of P&G's global drive to tap the growing opportunity of developing markets, where a huge population base, coupled with an emerging middle class and a steadier economic environment, offer a potentially lucrative mix. ""We are in Africa because of the size,"" Panayotopoulos said. ""It's about a billion people, that's the size of China and India for example, just under, and the population is growing, the economies are getting more and more stable, so huge opportunities here,"" he added. Read this: 'China can transform Africa' Rob Davies, South Africa's minister of trade and industry, welcomed the news of the construction of the new P&G factory, saying that the investment was ""a further example of confidence by leading manufactures in the future of South Africa."" As the continent's biggest economy, South Africa is a key market for P&G, whose portfolio of products includes consumer stalwarts such as Tide, Gillette and Pantene. The company, which built in 2009 a manufacturing plant for Pampers nappies in Johannesburg, has been in the country since the mid-1990s and says that its brands serve more than half of South African households. Read this: 'Western diseases' drive pharma boom in Africa . But while Panayotopoulos concedes that P&G has been a bit late in tapping other African markets, he says the group is increasingly looking to expand to other parts of the continent and reach its one billion potential customers. ""We have businesses in Nigeria, in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania -- we are going to go to Angola, Ethiopia,"" says Panayotopoulos. ""We want to be in every country,"" he adds. ""In the last 10 years we've gone from about 20% of our business being in emerging markets to about 40%. Obviously there is a huge upside; this is where the babies are being born, where more and more consumers are getting ready for our products, so it's really taken off in the last few years, last 10 years for us."" Read this: Is Africa much richer than we think? Panayotopoulos says that emerging markets, especially the BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, and China -- are currently driving demand for P&G and other consumer goods groups. ""Africa is also very relevant and is very similar to the BRIC markets too,"" he adds. Teo Kermeliotis contributed to this report.","P&G is planning to build a new manufacturing hub in South Africa .

"(CNN) -- Martin Luther King Jr. fought and died so blacks would no longer be viewed as inferior but rather enjoy the same inherent rights given to whites in America. Yet in 2014, 50 years since the passage of the Civil Rights Act, the West View News thinks it's appropriate to publish a story about our first black president, Barack Obama, with the headline, ""The Nigger in the White House."" Oh, the times we are living in. All I could do was feel sick to my stomach when I read the headline that the monthly newspaper serving Manhattan's Lower West Side published. And it brought up the pain my family went through nearly four decades ago. Not only is the word reprehensible but also why would an editor of a newspaper use the n-word in a headline about America's first black president? As a black woman who is a dogged critic of Obama's policies and his presidency and also happens to be the daughter of parents who grew up in the segregated South and were called that word, I find the headline disgusting and reprehensible to say about the nation's first black President, even if the author claimed he was actually writing in support of the President. The article, written by an 86-year-old white man, James Lincoln Collier, supports Obama, noting, ""far right voters hate Obama because he is black."" ""That was the whole point in this, that a great many people in the United States continue to think of President Obama as the n****r, and I wanted to make that point, that there's a substantial amount of racism still existing in the United States,"" Collier told CNN's Don Lemon on Monday. I guess Collier could be a liberal but in his heart still feels it is OK to use that word to describe Obama. Clearly, no political party owns racism and that's just the problem. For the record, I don't think it's OK for blacks to call each other the word either or for so-called black hip-hop artists to lace their music with the word like they're saying the ""hello."" Still, despite all the major achievements of blacks before and since the Civil Rights movement, most notably the attaining the highest office in the land, many whites in this country have a deep-seated hatred toward blacks and will never view us as equal. They even think they are complimenting us when they call us that word. And at the end of the day, that's all we're considered, no matter what we do or accomplish. In a pathetic attempt to defend using the headline, the West View News' editor, George Capsis, told the New York Post: . ""In this article, however, Jim reminded me that The New York Times avoids using the word which convinced me that West View should."" Capsis defends his decision as wanting to be provocative and ""out do"" the Times. I think it's more plain that. It seems the only way Capsis thought to praise a black President was to use a racist word to disparage him. The entire incident shows how far America has to yet to go in race relations. Remember, this is 2014. Not 1977. That's when I was just a child and my parents had to sue the Salisbury Country Club in Chesterfield, Virginia, suburb of Richmond, Virginia, for denying them membership a private club in our neighborhood only because we were black. It was then I learned about racism, specifically, that no matter what, some white people just hate black people for no other reason than the color of their skin. My father (Dr. Thomas Wright Jr., an accomplished dentist) and mother (Barbara B. Wright) had moved into their dream home they had spent a year building and applied for membership to the club their kids could ride their bikes to and learn how to swim and play tennis. But in the summer of 1977, the club's all-white board of directors voted to reject my parents' membership application. The all-white board also rejected the family of NFL all-pro star Willie Lanier. The club had no black members and no white applicant had ever been denied membership to the club. Part of the reason my parents built a home in Salisbury was because the real estate developers of the subdivision advertised homeowners could enjoy club membership. They just failed to mention it was a perk available to ""white-only homeowners."" After my parents got rejected, one of the co-developers, J. Kenneth Timmons, sent a letter to the Salisbury Country Club board of directors congratulating them on a job well-done and told them to ""continue to act in the same responsible way,"" according to June 5, 1980, Richmond Times-Dispatch article ""Club Fight Tires Black Dentist."" Like the author in the West View News, Timmons didn't use the n-word to refer to my parents in the body of his letter. But he may as well have because that's how he viewed them. After a lower court ruled against my parents, they appealed to the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which unanimously ruled on September 30, 1980, my parents had been discriminated against. My parents never joined the club. It wasn't about the membership. It was about respect and teaching their three children about doing what was right and ""responsible."" Just before the ruling was handed down, my father was quoted saying: . ""You can't believe it's 1980, and they're still doing this thing."" Sadly, it's 2014 and Dad, they're still doing the same thing, only this time to the President of the United States.

"(CNN) -- Here's a real shocker: Teens are better than their parents at using the Internet, and are likely to hide some of their online behaviors from them. That news comes from a 2,017-person survey funded by the online security software maker McAfee, which is pushing a product that helps parents monitor their kids online. Seventy percent of teens ""hide their online behavior"" from parents, according to the report, which was released Monday. That's up from 45% in 2010, the group says. These hidden behaviors include some things you might expect -- such as accessing violent (43%) or pornographic (32%) content online -- but also a few surprises. Fifteen percent of teens have hacked into social networks; 9% have hacked into e-mail accounts; 12% have met face to face with a person he or she met on the Internet; and 16% of teens surveyed said they had used their phones to cheat on tests at school. McAfee said parents are often unaware of these behaviors. Facebook quietly unveils 'stalking app' ""Parents, you must stay in-the-know,"" McAfee's Robert Siciliano wrote in a blog post. ""Since your teens have grown up in an online world, they may be more online savvy than their parents, but you can't give up. You must challenge yourselves to become familiar with the complexities of the teen online universe and stay educated on the various devices your teens are using to go online. ""As a parent of two young girls, I proactively participate in their online activities and talk to them about the 'rules of the road' for the Internet. I'm hoping that this report opens the eyes of parents to become more involved and also consider using technology such as McAfee Safe Eyes to protect their kids online."" There's the product pitch. McAfee Safe Eyes, like similar products from other security companies, lets parents spy on their kids' online behaviors and block certain websites. According to an online description of the product, Safe Eyes lets parents log the social-media posts and instant message conversations of their children. [Update: the pitch for McAfee Safe Eyes has since been removed from the blog post.] . Nearly half of parents install some sort of online controls, the survey said. Forty-four percent know their teens' passwords, and one in 10 uses a location-monitoring device. Not everyone advocates that approach to teen online security, however. ""We don't think it's a good idea for parents to spy on their kids surreptitiously, because eventually they're going to find something they have to confront them about, and it's going to destroy the other lines of communication,"" Justin Patchin, a criminal justice professor and co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center, told CNN in 2010. In the report, McAfee also encourages parents to be upfront with their children if they decide to monitor their behaviors. ""Half of teens say they would think twice about their online activities if they knew parents were watching,"" the report said. The McAfee-funded report, which was carried out by the research company TRU, surveyed 1,013 parents and 1,004 teens between the ages of 13 and 17. The interviews were conducted online in May. The report, titled ""The digital divide: How the online behavior of teens is getting past parents"" (PDF), also includes a list of the ""top 10 ways teens are fooling their parents."" Here's the list, with the percentage of teens who said they engaged in these behaviors, according to the survey results: . 1. Clear browser history (53%) 2. Close/minimize browser when parent walked in (46%) 3. Hide or delete IMs or videos (34%) 4. Lie or omit details about online activities (23%) 5. Use a computer your parents don't check (23%) 6. Use an Internet-enabled mobile device (21%) 7. Use privacy settings to make certain content viewable only by friends (20%) 8. Use private browsing modes (20%) 9. Create private e-mail address unknown to parents (15%) 10. Create duplicate/fake social network profiles (9%) What do you think of the results?

"(CNN) -- Northwestern University's football players voted Friday on whether to form a workers union -- one of the most high-profile efforts by college athletes to demand more rights, possibly including payment. But the result of the vote might not be known for months. The National Labor Relations Board allowed the vote after its Chicago office ruled in March that Northwestern football players can unionize, deeming them school employees because of the hours they put in, the control the university has over them and the revenue they generate. However, Northwestern asked the NRLB for a review -- and the NLRB said the results of Friday's vote won't be made public until that is finished. The review could take months. Still, the group that wants to represent the players -- the College Athletes Players Association -- said Friday was special because the athletes, by voting, exercised ""their rights under labor laws -- rights the NCAA has fought hard to deny them."" ""The NCAA cannot vacate this moment in history and its implications for the future,"" CAPA founder Ramogi Huma said. If Northwestern loses the review, the players' votes would count. A majority will have needed to vote in favor for the effort to be successful. Northwestern is arguing that players are not university employees but ""students, first and foremost.' Some players at Northwestern say they want better medical coverage, concussion testing, four-year scholarships that cover the entire cost of attendance, and the possibility of being paid. They're led by Huma and former Northwestern quarterback Kain Colter. Not all of the players were in favor. Two of the team's leaders -- quarterback Trevor Siemian and running back Venric Mark -- said they wouldn't vote for unionizing. Mark told reporters on April 19 that he hoped the ""NCAA does understand some things do need to change, but we do not need a third party to come in between us and the coaches."" NCAA President Mark Emmert has called the idea of unionized collegiate sports teams ""grossly inappropriate."" ""It would blow up everything about the collegiate model of athletics,"" he said, . The NCAA contends that athletes are paid in the form of a free education. Athletes also get team-issued shoes and other athletic gear, paid travel, coaching and free medical aid. The Northwestern players' vote came weeks after a class-action lawsuit filed by current players who want the NCAA compensation cap to be erased, and more than a month before trial is set to begin in the case of former UCLA basketball player Ed O'Bannon lawsuit's against the NCAA. O'Bannon is suing on behalf of current football and men's basketball players, and is seeking to get them a share of the millions that the NCAA makes off of their likenesses. On Thursday, the NCAA proposed changes that would give the five power conferences -- Southeastern Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, Big Ten, Big 12 and Pacific-12 -- more options in how they treat athletes. Among many proposed changes, the NCAA may consider allowing schools to increase scholarships to cover the cost of living, and not just the cost of tuition, for athletes. CNN's Sara Ganim and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Northwestern University football players vote Friday on whether to unionize .

"(CNN) -- The kidnapped president of the Libyan Olympic Committee was freed Sunday, a week after he was seized, the country's state news agency reported. It is not clear who kidnapped Ahmad Nabil al-Alam or why. Security officials are debriefing him to learn more about the identity and motive of his kidnappers, said Hashem Bashar, the head of the interim Supreme Security Committee Branch in the capital Tripoli. Al-Alam was kidnapped in central Tripoli on July 15, the Libyan Olympic Committee said at the time. He was followed by two vehicles and then seized by unidentified gunmen around 4 p.m., the committee said. Al-Alam is supposed to head the Libyan delegation in London for the Olympic games, which begin on Friday. On Monday, the committee issued a statement saying the ""Libyan sports family"" condemns ""this heinous crime."" It described al-Alam as a ""man who greatly contributed to the"" revolution that led to strongman Moammar Gadhafi's ouster last year. Al-Alam ""bore arms to defend its principles until Libya was liberated from the tyranny,"" the statement said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Al Qaeda operatives are leaving the battle zones along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and heading for Somalia and Yemen, where they have set up training camps, according to U.S. intelligence officials. Somalian President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed has been targeted by al Qaeda. The officials believe that al Qaeda may see the Horn of Africa as its new headquarters after dozens of attacks from U.S. drones along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The officials could not be named because of the sensitive nature of the information. However, CIA Director Leon Panetta said the intelligence agency is keeping tabs the region as a possible destination for fleeing al Qaeda operatives. ""Our concern right now is that likely safe havens are areas in the Horn of Africa, like Somalia and Yemen, that are countries that because of their political status can be attractive to al Qaeda in order to operate there,"" Panetta said Thursday. ""We are focusing on those countries as well in order to ensure that there is no safe haven for al Qaeda as we continue to pressure them, continue to push them and hopefully continue to make the effort to destroy them, not only in Pakistan but throughout the rest of the world."" Residents and journalists in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital city, have reported seeing foreign fighters among Al-Shabaab, the radical Islamic militia that is battling to overthrow the weak transitional government. Those foreign fighters have recently distributed recorded messages from al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden calling for the overthrow of President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed's government. Al-Shabaab is blamed for a surge of violence in Somalia as insurgents fight the government to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or sharia. The rebel group has said it has recruited many fighters in its battle. Al-Shabaab, also known as the Mujahedeen Youth Movement, was officially designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. government in March 2008. Somalia is not new territory for the militant organization, CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen said. ""Al Qaeda was running training camps in Somalia in the early and mid-1990s,"" he said. ""If this is now coming back, this is something that al Qaeda has already done, and it's worrisome for the future. ""The fact that we're seeing evidence of this already happening in both Yemen and Somalia suggests that, A, the drone program in the tribal areas of Pakistan has been effective, but, B, you know it's pushing al Qaeda into areas where they'll build up larger operations.""

"(CNN) -- Shot twice. Tied up in a sack. Thrown into a canal. Yet somehow, 18-year-old Saba Maqsood lived to tell her story. Had she not, Pakistani police say, it could very well have been another honor murder. Those responsible for her horror, Maqsood told reporters Friday, are her father and brother. They shot her because they didn't approve of her marriage to a neighbor, she said. The first bullet hit her cheek, the next one her hand, after which the teenager says she ""was slightly conscious, but alive."" ""They put me into a sack, tied up the mouth of the sack and threw it into the canal,"" Maqsood recalled. ""They thought I was dead, but I was not."" It was in a canal in the city of Hafizabad, a city in Punjab province about 120 kilometers (75 miles) northwest of Lahore, that workers at a gas station spotted the sack and the young woman inside and immediately alerted authorities, Hafizabad police officer Ali Akbar told CNN. After corroborating the basics of Maqsood's story, including her injuries, Akbar said, ""This seems to be an honor-related crime."" Such crimes -- which the perpetrators rationalize as necessary because the targeted women have somehow brought dishonor on a family -- are hardly unprecedented in Pakistan, a nation of about 180 million people. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said 869 women were victims last year. One recent case that's gotten worldwide attention is the killing last month of Farzana Parveen, a 25-year-old woman who was publicly beaten to death with bricks in Lahore because she married a man against her family's wishes. There have been 13 arrests in her case, including her father, a brother and a cousin -- Deputy Inspector General Zulfikar Hameed said. Suspects in stoning death to go to terrorism court .

"(CNN) -- If there were ever a contest for ""America's sweetheart,"" Sandra Bullock would be tough to beat. The daughter of an Army employee and a German vocal coach, Bullock has continually struck a chord with fans over her nearly 30-year career. At turns charming and relatable, she comes across as extremely genuine in a field that makes its magic through pretending. As the actress celebrates her 50th birthday on July 26, her stock as the long-standing favorite is as solid as ever. Examine the evidence: She is firmly in the top 10 list of Hollywood's highest paid actresses, and her films tend to make money. Her 2013 sci-fi thriller ""Gravity,"" which starred Bullock as an astronaut lost in space, earned $716 million worldwide. And in her personal life, Bullock has managed to remain pretty scandal-proof. At the height of a devastating marital breakup from Jesse James in 2010, when lurid tabloid headlines appeared about his alleged affairs, Bullock shocked the world with news that she had secretly adopted an African-American son from New Orleans. Not only was it surprising that the Oscar-winning actress had such a tight circle that she was able to conceal a monumental personal moment, but unlike some other celebs who had been criticized in the black community for transracial adoptions, Bullock and her decision were mostly embraced. Even other celebrities adore her. ""Avengers"" star Chris Evans has been quoted as saying Bullock was his first celebrity crush. ""I saw 'Speed' when I was in seventh grade, and I was like, that's my lady,"" Evans said. ""I literally had a big poster (of her)."" It's easy to see why a preteen Evans fell for Bullock. In interviews Bullock can be funny, self-deprecating and just downright cool. During an appearance on ""The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson"" to promote her 2013 buddy cop comedy, ""The Heat,"" she and the host good-naturedly took verbal swipes at each other. When Ferguson mentioned the film ""Dumb and Dumber"" (in an apparent reference to the way their interview was going), Bullock volleyed back about that movie. ""Poop humor is fun,"" she said jokingly. ""If you do the toilet scenes well and commit to them they can be really, really powerful."" Not many Academy Award winners would tackle such a subject, but it's not surprising from Bullock, who proudly told Us Weekly that her now-3-year-old son, Louis, is fully potty-trained. While the actress has almost always been tagged as more girl next door than vixen, motherhood has clearly helped settle her even more. She's been very outspoken about the fact that she would give it all up, the career and the fame, if it wasn't good for her son in any way. ""I don't want him to have pressures brought on by what I do. I will quit. I will leave,"" she told Vogue last year. ""If I see whatever I'm doing affecting him negatively, I will pack up and move to Alaska."" That probably helps explain why the self-professed homebody would much rather be spending time with her kid than working the press. Eschewing the Hollywood scene, the ""Blind Side"" star has made paparazzi literally chase her outside the usual city limits, choosing to build her life in cities like Austin, Texas, and New Orleans. Being on the red carpet, she told CNN at a 2013 premiere of ""Gravity,"" is extreme enough for her. ""Being in front of a camera, in a nice dress, getting all dressed up is extreme,"" Bullock said. ""There's a lot of other extreme situations, you know, just getting out of bed sometimes is extreme -- but I do it. Just got to do it, just got to get up. Put your sweatpants on, brush off the dog hair and just get out of the house!"" Part of what Bullock does when she gets ""out of the house"" is give back to the city of New Orleans. After the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, Bullock ""adopted"" Warren Easton Charter High School, and has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to the institution. In May 2014, she surprised the graduating class with a commencement speech. ""They're infections, they inspire me,"" Bullock said of the students. ""They make me get off my butt and try to do better. ... I've been taking and taking from (the city of New Orleans), and when everything happened with Katrina, that's when you realize you have to put back.""","Sandra Bullock turns 50 on July 26 .

"Beijing (CNN) -- In China online popularity can sometimes spell trouble. Charles Xue realized that recently when he was arrested in Beijing on charges of soliciting prostitutes. Xue's supporters claim he is being singled out because of his online activities. Xue, 60, is a Chinese-American businessman and blogger, whose regular musings about issues such as corruption and political reform have made him hugely popular -- he has more than 12 million followers on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter-like micro-blogging site. But he has also caught the attention of authorities. His arrest, prominently reported in state-run media, is widely seen by Chinese netizens as part of a government crackdown on the spread of rumors on the Internet. On Friday, another well-known microblogger was reported to have been detained. Dong Rubin was being held on charges of mis-stating his company's registered capital, according to a statement from his lawyer reported by the South China Morning Post. China has more Internet users than any other country, with more than 500 million people online, and an estimated 300 million microblog users. Although the services are censored -- with sensitive terms blocked and posts deleted -- the speed with which information can be disseminated has proven a headache for Beijing. While the microblogs have been used to disseminate false information such as extraterrestrial sightings, they have also become a forum for spreading news of scandals, protests and venting public anger at incidents such as the 2011 Wenzhou bullet train crash, when the response from authorities was heavily criticized online. After that incident, which focused public opinion against authorities, a senior Beijing official visited the headquarters of Sina and urged the Internet firm to curb the spread of ""false information."" Counting re-tweets . Since then the authorities have even quantified what constitutes such a crime. ""Internet users who share false information that is defamatory or harms the national interest face up to three years in prison if their posts are viewed 5,000 times or forwarded 500 times, under a judicial interpretation released on Monday,"" the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported this week. If a netizen posts a single message deemed as slanderous, for instance, and it's viewed more than 5,000 times, or re-tweeted or shared more than 500 times, it may be considered as a ""serious case"" punishable under China's libel law. The authorities have not been slow to take action. Last month Beijing police closed down an Internet marketing company and arrested four of its employees for publishing posts attacking Lei Feng, a ""selfless"" People's Liberation Army soldier who became the subject of an official propaganda campaign after his death more than four decades ago. The police said the company, Erma, has long used salacious and provocative posts about public figures and institutions to ""rock"" the Internet and drive traffic to certain sites, the South China Morning Post reported. Earlier this year, journalist Liu Hu was arrested after publicly accusing a senior official of negligence. Prior to his detention, Liu used his real Weibo account to make repeated allegations against Ma Zhengqi, deputy director of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce and former vice-mayor of Chongqing, a bustling metropolis in southwest China. The police have said only that Liu was suspected of fabricating and spreading rumors. Persecution . According to Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher with Human Rights Watch, China's state media may say the campaign is aimed at combating fraud, hoaxes and defamation, but in reality ""it is more a political persecution of critics of the party and the government."" But why the crackdown now? It is prompted in large part by the uncertainty caused by China's slowing economic growth and by the current leadership transition in China, said Jeremy Goldkorn, founder and editor of Danwei, a China-focused blog and media research firm. ""These factors have caused the party to return to the Leninist tactic of stepping up information controls, and to the Maoist practice of asking 'who are our enemies?' and 'who are our friends?' which is why some social media personalities now find themselves in trouble,"" he said. Shaping opinions . Another factor is that China's massive Internet-savvy population consists mostly of young people who go online for online games, e-commerce and social networking. Each day, tens of millions of people use micro-blogging services such as Weibo to share information. Among them are celebrity bloggers like Xueâ€” business tycoons, movie stars, writers and commentatorsâ€” who have millions of ""followers,"" giving them enormous influence in shaping the opinions of such a large and mobile population -- a real worry for the Beijing government anxious to avoid an erosion of its control. As a result -- no doubt influenced by the online whistle blowers exposing official malfeasance -- the new administration of President Xi Jinping is pursuing an anti-corruption campaign, vowing to target those who put the party and state in jeopardy. ""Xi was forced to accelerate the drive by a steady drum beat of Internet revelations that forced the regime to sack and try a series of mid-level officials to demonstrate to a deeply cynical public that it was willing to act against rampant corruption and arrogance of power,"" said Andrew Wedeman, author of ""Double Paradox: Rapid Growth and Rising Corruption in China."" ""The contradictory response to the media, bloggers and whistle blowers reflects the regime's fear that it might be losing control of the campaign,"" Wedeman said. ""It cannot afford to let the Internet keep driving the campaign. It cannot lose control over the choice of targets."" Internet regulation . Yet even advocates for change accept not all accusations made online are accurate. ""You have a need to regulate the Internet,"" said Bequelin. ""There are a lot of unsavory things happening in China, such as unscrupulous PR companies mounting campaigns against another company just to offer their service to put an end to it. But the best disinfectant is sunlight. If you have a free press, then these rumors just get dragged out naturally."" Because many Chinese citizens do not trust the state-run media to expose any wrongdoings of the party, Bequelin said, they turn to Weibo. Meantime, the authorities are trying to assuage concerns that the drive against rumor-mongering could muzzle legitimate whistleblowers. A recent Xinhua report quoted Sun Jungong, a spokesman for China's Supreme Court, pledging that ""netizens who help expose corruption online will not face charges, even if their posts are not 100% accurate."" Still, the campaign may be intimidating some bloggers. ""When posting on Weibo, some bloggers joke about it by adding words like 'be kind to me, don't forward more than 500 times',"" said a Chinese journalist who requested anonymity. ""Others are having fun forwarding nonsensical messages, press releases or Weibo postings from government accounts more than 500 times."" ""At some point, the government will need to declare victory and pull back,"" said Wedeman, a professor at University of Nebraska-Lincoln who has focused on the issue of corruption in China. ""So long as it cannot control the flow of rumors and charges on the Internet, it cannot begin to draw the campaign to a close without looking like it is sweeping things under the rug.""","Chinese government involved in crackdown on the spread of rumors on the Internet .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- In 1989, the warnings were dire. The Spike Lee film ""Do the Right Thing,"" critics and columnists said, would provoke violence and disrupt race relations. Spike Lee: ""I wanted to do a film that would try to show what was happening at the time."" ""This movie is dynamite under every seat,"" wrote Newsweek's Jack Kroll. Other commentators believed the film would harm the candidacy of David Dinkins, an African-American who was running for mayor of New York. It might even spark riots at movie theaters, they thought. Instead, what the film provoked was ... talk. There were no riots. Dinkins was elected. ""Do the Right Thing"" had a successful run at the box office -- if not as successful as Lee and his supporters hoped -- and was nominated for two Academy Awards. Twenty years later, the film still maintains a hold on the imagination. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked it as one of the 100 best American films. Roger Ebert, who has written he cried when he first saw the film at the Cannes Film Festival, still considers the film a wonder: ""Spike Lee had done an almost impossible thing. He'd made a movie about race in America that empathized with all the participants,"" he wrote in 2001. So what is the thing about ""Do the Right Thing?""  Watch Spike Lee describe things in his own words » . Part of its staying power is in its boldness, both in look and action. Lee's first two films, ""She's Gotta Have It"" (1986) and ""School Daze"" (1988), had marked him as a rising young filmmaker. But it was ""Do the Right Thing,"" made when Lee was just 32, that showcased his confidence, from the deliberately striking color scheme (bright reds and oranges that make a hot day seem even hotter) to its heightened -- sometimes stagy -- atmosphere, to its grim, documentary-style riot climax. Then there was its willingness to address issues head-on. Lee has said he wrote the film quickly, upset by racial incidents roiling New York City in the 1980s. (In one, the 1986 Howard Beach tragedy, three black men who had wandered into the largely Italian neighborhood by mistake were beaten by a group of white teens; one of the men was killed as he fled across a nearby highway.) ""When I wrote the script ... New York City was a very polarized city, racially,"" he said. ""I wanted to do a film that would try to show what was happening at the time."" He was also determined to roll in other clashes between poor locals and gentrifying whites, between police and citizenry, even between men and women. That friction takes a simple, sketchy plot -- a scorching day in the life of Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood -- and turns it into a series of tense standoffs. The generally African-American residents are trying to beat the heat. Sal, an Italian pizza shop owner, oversees his corner business. A local agitator, Buggin Out, crosses Sal. Sal's prejudiced son Pino faces off with Mookie, the delivery man played by Lee. The residents grumble at the Korean grocer. But all is more or less calm until Sal busts the boombox of the defiant Radio Raheem, and then hell breaks loose. The passion of ""Do the Right Thing"" is obvious: ""Opinion will always be divided on ... 'Do the Right Thing,' "" wrote The New Yorker's Anthony Lane. ""But it remains a thrilling panorama of social crackup -- a wide and worthy development of themes that Lee had been mulling since 'She's Gotta Have It.' "" The film also boasts indelible performances -- Lee, Danny Aiello as Sal, Giancarlo Esposito as Buggin Out, Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee as Da Mayor and Mother Sister, John Turturro as Pino -- and memorable music, a mix of jazz penned by Lee's father, Bill, and the Public Enemy song ""Fight the Power."" But perhaps the real reason people talk about ""Do the Right Thing"" two decades on is because it's still relevant. Lee makes the point that race issues haven't vanished simply because America has a black president. ""It's not like this thing has disappeared because {President Obama} is in the White House,"" he said. Some things have improved, particularly the atmosphere in New York itself, he said. But, ""We've got a lot of work to do."" Ironically, some of that work has to be done at Hollywood studios. Though Lee is quick to credit Universal and its then head Tom Pollock for championing the film, he said things haven't changed much in the movie business. ""Sports is so much more advanced than Hollywood,"" he said. ""I can go for a meeting at a studio [and] the only black person I'm going to see is the brother-man at the gate letting me in.""","""Do the Right Thing"" came out 20 years ago this summer .

"(CNN) -- A Malaysian politician who drew gasps by evoking Hitler in a congratulatory tweet to the German World Cup team has apologized, in his own inimitable style. ""When Germany whacked Brazil, I unintentionally said something that hurt d feeling of d ppl in Germany.MY SINCEREST APPOLOGY.LONG LIVE BUNG."" A member of the United Malays National Organization, Bung Moktar Radin posted his initial tweet on Tuesday after Germany knocked Brazil out of the World Cup with an impressive 7-1 win. ""WELL DONE..BRAVO...LONG LIVE HITLER..."", he tweeted to around 20,000 followers. Predictably, a flurry of tweets followed, with many questioning Bung's sanity and how he came to be in politics. To his credit, the MP responded, but perhaps not in a way some might have wished. To @shaike49's contention that he was a ""low class crazy MP,"" the politician wrote: ""u can get lost... and enjoy with the loser."" To @layzebone's direct statement: ""You're an idiot... educate yourself,"" the MP said: ""say its to ur self."" By Thursday, Bung's online antics had caught the attention of the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak who tweeted to his two million followers: ""The comments made by Datuk Bung Moktar are unacceptable and wrong, and he will withdraw them."" He added: (Bung) ""does not speak for Malaysia, or for ordinary Malaysians, who understand Europe's tragic past, and respect its modern unity."" ""This should be a time of celebration for Germany, and we wish them all the best in the final."" One might think after causing an online furore over a six-word post, the politician might take a break from Twitter. Not Bung. Within one hour of posting his apology, he responded to a user who said: ""Try saying this in europe, and see how fast u get gun down,"" with ""im worried they might gun down u first."" On Wednesday, Bung defended his Hitler reference, telling Malaysia's Star Online: ""I don't know what's wrong with people sometimes."" ""Hitler is part of history and the German team fought like how he did."" After initially condemning the comments as ""an unacceptable allusion to the fascist regime of Adolf Hitler,"" the German Ambassador to Malaysia has now put the episode behind him. ""With MP Bung Moktar's apology, I consider this matter closed,"" Holger Michael said in a statement. ""Let us now look forward to two more thrilling and exciting games."" It remains illegal in Germany to glorify Hitler or the Nazi Party, or to display symbols of the regime including flags, uniforms and slogans. Earlier on Thursday, the Malaysian Chinese Association also demanded an apology from the MP. In a statement on its website, the group's religious harmony bureau chairman Datuk Ti Lian Ker said he was ""ashamed and appalled"" by the tweet. ""From insulting women to disabled people, Kinabatangan MP Datuk Bung Mokhtar is no stranger to controversy, but now his zero common sense in attributing Germany's win to Hitler will make Malaysia the centre of a negative attention once again.""","Malaysian MP apologizes for mentioning Hitler in World Cup tweet .

"(CNN) -- The mother of a 25-year-old woman killed in a Boston hotel more than a week ago said Friday that she will remain haunted by her daughter's death for the rest of her life. The mother of Julissa Brisman says she remains haunted by her daughter's death. ""Our family has been devastated by the loss of our beautiful daughter, Julissa,"" Carmen Guzman said in a statement released Friday, which would have been Julissa Brisman's 26th birthday. ""The feeling of losing my daughter in this way and the pain she must have felt will haunt me for the rest of my life,"" Guzman said. ""She won't live to see her dreams. We will hold Julissa in our hearts every day."" Philip Markoff, 23, a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine, is charged with killing Brisman on April 14 at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel. Police have said that Brisman, a model from New York, advertised as a masseuse on the online classifieds Web site Craigslist. They say Markoff may have met her through the online site. Prosecutors say Brisman sustained blunt head trauma, and said she was shot three times at close range. One of the bullets passed through her heart, killing her, prosecutors said. Markoff, who was arraigned Tuesday, is being held without bail. His attorney, John Salsberg, told reporters after the hearing that Markoff is ""not guilty of the charges. He has his family's support. I have not received any document or report or piece of evidence other than what I heard in the courtroom. All I have at the moment are words -- no proof of anything."" A procedural not-guilty plea was entered on Markoff's behalf, according to Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley. Markoff is also charged in connection with the April 10 robbery of Trisha Leffler, 29, at a Westin Hotel in Boston. Leffler was robbed of $800 in cash and $250 in American Express giftcards, according to police reports. She was held at gunpoint and bound, prosecutors said. Megan McAllister, who identified herself as Markoff's fiancee, maintained his innocence in an e-mail sent to ABC News. McAllister said Markoff ""is the wrong man"" and ""was set up."" ""Unfortunately, you were given wrong information as was the public,"" she wrote. ""All I have to say to you is Philip is a beautiful person inside and out and could not hurt a fly!"" Authorities believe the motive in Brisman's death was robbery, Conley told reporters. In executing a search warrant at Markoff's home, police found a firearm, along with restraints and duct tape, he said. Authorities in Boston are working with police in Warwick, Rhode Island, on what could be a related case. On April 16 at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, a man tied up and demanded money from a 26-year-old dancer who had posted a Craigslist advertisement, Warwick Police Chief Col. Stephen McCartney said. The robbery was interrupted when the woman's husband entered the room. After pointing his gun at the husband, the suspect fled, McCartney said. He said the incident ""may be related to similar crimes occurring in the Boston area"" but that had not been determined.","Mother of Craigslist victim Julissa Brisman says family 'devastated' by loss .

"PADUCAH, Kentucky (CNN)  -- Defense attorneys hoping to save former U.S. soldier Steven Green from the death penalty presented witnesses Thursday who described Green's childhood as troubled and stressful. Former U.S. soldier Steven Green has been convicted of raping and killing a 14-year-old Iraqi girl. Green was convicted last week in U.S. District Court in Kentucky of murder, rape, conspiracy and obstruction of justice. A jury found Green guilty of raping a 14-year-old girl, then killing her and setting her body on fire to destroy evidence. Green also was found guilty of killing the girl's parents and 6-year-old sister. He could become the first former U.S. soldier to get the death penalty for war crimes before a civilian court, where he was tried because he had been discharged from the military before his crimes came to light. Four other former soldiers are in prison for their roles in the crimes and the cover-up that followed. Testimony in the sentencing phase focused Thursday on Green's early years, with witnesses describing him as the middle child of a dysfunctional west Texas family, unwanted by his mother and routinely beaten to the point of injury by his older brother. Clinical social worker Jan Vogelsang, testifying for the defense, said she interviewed the defendant's immediate relatives and studied his family history. Vogelsang characterized Green as the attention-starved second son among three siblings. Family members told her that he ""became the child that was odd and different,"" she said. According to Vogelsang, Green's mother, Roxanne, worked at a bar for most of his early years in the town of Midland, Texas. His mother jokingly called him ""demon spawn"" throughout his childhood, while she referred to his older brother as ""the golden child,"" Vogelsang said. ""She often repeated that had Steven been born in Colonial times, she would be able to take him outside the village and stone him,"" Vogelsang said. His parents split up by the time Green was 4. After he moved from Midland with his mother and her new husband, he was diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder at 9 and put on an anti-depressant drug, Vogelsang said, adding that she questioned whether his mother properly administered the medication. She noted that Green's standardized test scores reflected a bright child with ""considerable intellectual ability."" But she said Green's mother had no interest in parenting and it fell to Green's older brother to take on the role of disciplinarian. Three years older and significantly bigger, the brother once beat Steven Green to the point 'his head swelled like a pumpkin,"" according to testimony. Vogelsang pointed out that Green appeared to respond well to the discipline of military life. His family members at the time noted ""he was a changed man"" in the Army. After returning from Iraq, Green lived with various relatives. A cousin, Suzi Woolsey, testified that Green briefly stayed with her. His appearance after returning from the war was shocking, she said. He was thin and his eyes had sunk into his head. He had few clothes, ate little and spent much of the week at her house watching late-night television. He played with her 2-year-old daughter, Woolsey said, and Woolsey recounted a trip to visit Green in jail after his arrest. Her daughter, by then 3, went with her and, when they met, Green was wearing shackles. The child asked about the restraints, and Green told her, ""Well, I run really, really fast,"" Woolsey said. The trial resumes Monday in the U.S. District Court of western Kentucky.","Steven Green faces death penalty for rape of Iraqi teen, murder of her and family .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- On a July morning in 2005, Noel Miller came home from working the night shift at an Iowa nursing home. She told police she arrived around 6:20 a.m. and discovered that her 5-year-old daughter, Evelyn, was missing. Evelyn Miller, 5, was found floating in the Cedar River a mile from her home in July 2005. Everyone else was fast asleep. Some 1,500 volunteers joined the six-day search for Evelyn Miller, but it ended tragically. The little girl was found floating in the Cedar River near rural Floyd, Iowa. That was four years ago, and police still have not charged anyone in Evelyn's death.  Watch an update on the case » . At the time she disappeared, Evelyn was living in an apartment complex with her mother, two half-brothers and the man her mother planned to marry, Casey Frederiksen. Two friends were visiting him. They had spent the night, which was not unusual. Noel Miller looked for her daughter, then called 911. The call launched a massive search for Evelyn, beginning at her apartment and extending outward for seven miles. ""That area was completely covered,"" Floyd County Sheriff Rick Lynch said. Police and volunteers hiked through cornfields and wooded areas. Authorities deployed infrared airplanes and sent dive teams into local rivers and quarries. On the sixth evening of the search, two kayakers found Evelyn's body floating in a river just one mile from her home. ""It takes anywhere from three to five days if it's a drowning, then the body will come to the surface,"" Lynch said. The Floyd County Sheriff's Office has not released what caused Evelyn's death. But Lynch said, ""We believe she was a victim of foul play."" ""This is definitely a homicide,"" said Floyd County Attorney Jesse Marzen. ""We want to make sure that law enforcement investigates as completely and as thoroughly as possible."" Investigators have narrowed their suspect list to three people, Lynch said, but police are not ready to publicly name them. ""I'm sure the general public is not going to be surprised,"" Lynch said, adding, ""I feel confident that we will make an arrest soon."" Since the little girl's death, the three men who were staying at the apartment have been in trouble with the law. Miller's fiancé, Frederiksen, is serving a 14-year sentence for a child pornography conviction. He recently was named in an indictment accusing him of producing methamphetamine in the apartment where he lived with Evelyn before her murder. Frederiksen's former attorney, Jane Kelly, said he has a new lawyer, who practices in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. That attorney, Dan O'Brien, did not return a call from CNN requesting comment. Lynch said the investigation included all registered sex offenders in the area. ""All of their alibis checked out and we've ruled them out,"" he said. Frederiksen and Miller have since lost custody of their two sons, who are in foster care. Investigators said they need additional corroborating evidence to make an arrest and are waiting for the final piece of the puzzle. They plan to use a new piece of investigative equipment that is expected to move the inquiry forward, Lynch said. ""It's something that came up in the last few months."" For now, he's not discussing details. ""We just can't explain what the equipment is,"" Lynch added, ""because if we explained when we were going to do it and what the equipment was, it could expose information to a perpetrator."" Evelyn's grandmother, Linda Christie, is hopeful police soon will provide the answers she has been waiting four years to hear.  She doesn't consider Evelyn's death to be a cold case. ""They work on this case at least every two weeks,"" she said. But, she admits, ""It is a waiting game."" To protect the investigation, police aren't discussing any potential DNA evidence. ""The story never goes to black and white for us,"" Lynch said. ""We are on it every day. It always goes to full color."" Marzen also wants the public to know that progress is being made and the investigation remains ""very active."" Anyone with information that could lead to the arrest or conviction of the persons responsible for Evelyn Miller's death is asked to call the Floyd County Sheriff's Office at 641-228-1821.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- MeLisa Cleary was 30 years old and a mother of three when her marriage started to fall apart. MeLisa Cleary's body was found near railroad tracks more than 20 miles from her home. She was in the process of separating from her husband, Daniel, when she was last seen on June 6, 2008. Her body was found three days later near the railroad tracks in Hartsburg, Illinois, a town more than 20 miles away from Mackinaw, where the Clearys lived. Police said her body showed significant signs of blunt force trauma, particularly to her head and neck. The Logan County Coroner ruled her death a homicide. According to friends and family, Cleary had expressed fear for her life to both her sister Brandy Gerard and her close friend Nicole Simpson. She had been sleeping on the couch at home during the week and spending weekends at Simpson's house. She was scraping by on money she made taking care of other people's children. Cleary was due at Simpson's house by 5:30 p.m. on Friday, June 6, but never arrived. She had spent the previous night there as well to avoid another quarrel with her husband. When Cleary didn't arrive, Simpson called her family. On the morning of June 7, police were called and Cleary was reported missing. Within hours of reporting her missing, Cleary's family found her 2004 Ford Expedition abandoned less than two miles from her home. Her keys and her purse were left inside the car. Cleary's body was discovered June 9 by Canadian National Railway workers. That same day, Daniel Cleary was seen leaving the couple's home with their three children. The car was loaded with packed luggage. Police issued an Amber Alert for the children, calling it a possible parental abduction. Cleary, his mother and the children were found June 10 at a motel in Peoria, Illinois. He was taken into custody, questioned and released. The children were placed in protective custody. Dan Cleary's lawyer, Jerry Serritella, had no comment. The investigation remains open, but police still have not announced any suspects in the case, nor have they made any arrests. They are continuing to work on it ""nonstop,"" said Capt. Bob Henderson of the Tazewell County Sheriff's department. ""I've got guys working on it right now,"" Henderson said. ""Actually, we're working on it through the Christmas holidays."" Because the case remains open and active, Henderson said he was reluctant to provide more than the basic details. On November 15, family and friends celebrated what would have been MeLisa Cleary's 31st birthday, holding a candlelight vigil. Her sister, Brandy Gerard, says she feels her sister's presence. ""It's like she's saying to me, don't quit. Keep fighting for justice."" Cleary's family to this day insists that Cleary would never leave her children home alone, and she wouldn't go anywhere without telling someone she knew and trusted. Family members won't say more because they don't want to jeopardize the investigation. The children, a girl, 12; a boy, 9; and another girl, 3, are in the custody of the state's Department of Children and Family Services, Henderson said. He would not discuss the situation in detail. Cleary's mother, Jean Cohoon, says it's difficult when she visits with her grandchildren, ""How can you answer a 3-year-old's questions about when her mommy and daddy are coming back,"" Cohoon says. ""If anybody has any pertinent information involving the disappearance and death of MeLisa, by all means give us a call,"" Henderson said. The Tazewell County Sheriff's Office can be reached at 309-346-4141. The Logan County Sheriff's Office can be reached at 217-732-2156.","MeLisa Cleary was last seen June 6; her body was found June 10 .

"(CNN) -- When I was a teenager and in my early twenties, I always discussed with my most trusted friends what it might be like to live in a free world. We were locked behind the Iron Curtain and none of us believed we would live to see the fall of the communist dictatorship. My father used to say: ""Every dictatorship will fall one day because it is inhuman, it is not natural. But communism is here for a long haul. We are not going to see it in our life times."" Thank God, we were all wrong. Life in Czechoslovakia was not free. My first political experience dates to August 1968. I was five when Czechoslovakia was invaded by Soviet troops. I remember soldiers in the streets, my mother crying, my father hitting a wall with his fist in frustration and my grandfather helplessly pacing in a living room. It did not get much better after that. My father had to fight for his job as a university professor after he was reported to the communist authorities for calling his students ""ladies and gentlemen"" instead of ""comrades."" I remember my mother getting up early to stand in a line for beef bones to make soup. I also remember how she would worry when my dad was late from work, wondering if he had he been arrested for being overheard telling a political joke or making a sarcastic comment about people waiting in line for toilet paper. I saw some of my brightest fellow students kicked out of university for publicly expressing political opinions -- young lives ruined. I also remember my frustration as a young mountain climber that I was not allowed to travel to the Alps or anywhere else west of the Curtain. I was lucky though. My parents managed to create a microcosm of relative normalcy in our home. They traveled on occasional business trips to the West and smuggled banned books by Vaclav Havel, Alexander Solzhenitsyn or George Orwell back to Czechoslovakia, an act that could have landed them in prison. I listened to Voice of America on the radio with my father every morning and evening -- quietly, so the neighbors couldn't hear us and report us. On my 15th birthday I got my first wristwatch and a translation of the inauguration speech of John F. Kennedy. In 1987 I landed a job as a producer of music programs on Czechoslovak Television in the city of Ostrava, earning about $60 a month. I was excited at first. I was working with Czechoslovak rock bands and pop stars. But from the beginning, my enthusiasm was eroded by numerous censors overseeing my work. They were mostly people who had no idea about TV or music, but had studied Marxism-Leninism and were employed to watch for ""ideologically harmful"" content. And in rock 'n' roll they saw plenty of it. Once, after months of negotiations, I managed to get a contract with a British company that allowed me free access to clips of music videos by international artsits. It was the first contract of its kind in the history of Czechoslovak television but when I went triumphantly took it to my boss, I was yelled at and called ""a propagator of imperialism."" My argument that songs by INXS, New Order or Tina Turner were not political fell on deaf ears. Two-thirds of the songs never made it to air. Through my job I was meeting and befriending a lot of amazing people. Talented artists, but also semi-legal bands, dissident bands or dissidents themselves. I felt that the mood in the society was changing. There had been occasional small anti-government demonstrations since 1988. More and more people were speaking out against the regime. A lot of banned bands performed illegally in private garages, summer cottages and even publically under false names. Still, I could not imagine the communists losing power. In June 1989, after a concert of Psi Vojaci, a group banned by authorities, I was approached by its singer to sign a petition linked to a pro-reform manifesto co-authored by Vaclav Havel that called for the release of all political prisoners, for freedom of the press, freedom of religion, for democratization of the society. I was aware that whoever signed the petition was professionally doomed. Singers had their albums pulled from the stores, writers had books pulled from bookstores and libraries, others lost jobs. Still it took me only a few minutes to sign it. I made a decision that I could no longer be friends with opponents of the regime and work for it at the same time. It was a professional suicide but I felt it was my only choice. I did not tell anyone that I had become a signatory. A couple of months later my mother called me at my office in hysterics. ""They read your name on Voice of America! Did you really sign it? Why did you ruin your life?"" A couple of months later I lost my job and in October 1989 I began my one-year mandatory military service. Besides military training we had to undergo intensive political education and watch the news on government-run TV. This is how I learned about the astonishing events in Hungary, Berlin and Bulgaria. Was it really collapsing? Would it ever come to Czechoslovakia as well? Then came the brutal crushing of a peaceful student demonstration in Prague on November 17. When our military commanders took away TV sets from our political classrooms, I knew that this was serious. After 48 hours in an information vacuum I finally managed to get in touch with my friends in Prague who told me that theaters and schools were on strike in protest over the clampdown. The next morning, during a military base assembly, I ignored a yelling commander, to stand before hundreds of soldiers and declare a 24-hour hunger strike in support of actors and students. The whole base followed. The same day the base doctor, a friend, signed me into his ward with ""pneumonia."" I was OK, but being declared sick exempted me from military training and enabled me to use the doctor's office to make phone calls. The biggest worry in Prague at that time was that the communists would use the army to suppress growing unrest in the country. These fears prompted me to write a petition declaring that we -- the conscripted soldiers who made up the most of the Czechoslovak military -- would never turn our weapons against citizens of Czechoslovakia. I soon started to collect signatures. In the evening I was faxing signed sheets to opposition leaders in Prague. We were very well organized. Visiting soldiers got copies of the petition and took it to their bases and units. After we had collected all the signatures we could at the base I was stationed at, my doctor friend sent me for a fake lung examination to one of the biggest military hospitals in Czechoslovakia in Ceske Budejovice. There, hundreds more soldiers signed. It was obvious that no one had an appetite to fight for the communists. In less then a week we collected thousands of signatures. News from Prague was also encouraging. The whole country was on strike and up to one million people were demonstrating next to the city's castle, demanding the resignation of the communist government and the politburo of the Communist Party. The night after my return to the base from Ceske Budejovice I was summoned by the commander's office. It was 2 a.m. and the room was full of top brass. ""Did you write it?"" one colonel asked me pointing at the petition. ""Well, it has my name on it, doesn't it?"" I replied. ""We want you to publicly recant it,"" he continued. I refused and tried to tell them that the regime's time was up and that they had better realize it now. ""If we would shoot you here, nobody would ever know,"" another colonel threatened. ""Before I came here I called my friends to say that I was coming to meet with you. They will start looking for me if I disappear."" I was bluffing filled with fear. ""Get out of here!"" they shouted, finally concluding the meeting. On November 24 the communist government resigned. Soon afterwards Vaclav Havel became the new president of Czechoslovakia. A couple of weeks later one of my commanders woke me up in the morning. ""Pack your stuff and go home,"" he said. ""What?"" I replied. ""Are you kicking me out?"" ""Whatever,"" he said. ""Just pack your stuff."" In Prague, I was asked to join the new government to join a committee looking at reforming of the Czechoslovak military. I turned down the offer. I wanted to resume my work in television. At my station, I was greeted by the same people who kicked me out: ""My hero. I owe you an apology. The Communist Party was deceiving me all these years. But now, I know better. I changed."" I felt sick to my stomach. But then, communism in any country did not enhance people's characters. It deformed them. Everybody tried to survive as best as they could, sometimes compromising their own values and dignity. I do not know how that person feels today. Perhaps there is even shame and regret. When I look back I do not regret being born in a communist country. Yes, we were deprived of freedom and many other things. But it was an intense life experience which taught me to appreciate what I have later in my life. I also feel privileged that I lived through and participated in some of the most important and exciting historical events of the 20th century. The only regret I have is that my father indeed did not live to experience it. He died of cancer in 1982.","CNN producer Tomas Etzler was in Czech military in 1989 .

"(CNN) -- ""Where is John Galt?"" reads a sign in the back of a vehicle heading down Interstate 85 in Atlanta, Georgia. Ayn Rand, shown here on a 1999 stamp, is finding new readers thanks to the economic crisis. The quotation is wrong. As any reader of Ayn Rand's ""Atlas Shrugged"" can attest, the correct line is ""Who is John Galt?""  but the point is well taken. In the midst of the credit crisis and the federal government's massive bailout plan, the works of Rand, a proponent of a libertarian, free-market philosophy she called Objectivism, are getting new attention. ""If only 'Atlas' were required reading for every member of Congress and political appointee in the Obama administration. I'm confident that we'd get out of the current financial mess a lot faster,"" Wall Street Journal columnist Stephen Moore wrote in early January. It's obviously getting attention from the general public. Rand book sales are ""going through the roof,"" said Yaron Brook, the president of the Ayn Rand Institute. According to Brook, ""Atlas Shrugged,"" her most famous novel, has sold more copies in the first four months of 2009 than it did for all of 2008 -- and in 2008, it sold 200,000 copies. It's been in Amazon.com's top 50 for more than a month. Not bad for a 1,100-page doorstop of a book that came out in 1957, by an author who died in 1982.  Watch why Rand is so beloved » . ""So many people see the parallels with actually what's going on, with the government taking over the banks, with the government kind of taking over the automobile industry, a president who fires the CEO of a major American corporation. These are the kind of things that come out of 'Atlas Shrugged,' "" Brook said. Even Hollywood is said to be interested, which is only fitting, since Rand was once a screenwriter. But developments have come in fits and starts. ""Godfather"" producer Albert S. Ruddy once wanted to make a film and talk of miniseries adaptations emerged in the '70s and '90s. In 2006, Angelina Jolie was said to have been signed to star as Rand's heroine, rail magnate Dagny Taggart, and names such as Russell Crowe and Brad Pitt have also been floated. However, as of early 2009, the status of the film remains unknown. ""Atlas Shrugged"" concerns a group of corporate chieftains and individualists who go on strike in protest of government intervention in business. Among those trying to figure out what's happening are Taggart and steel tycoon Hank Rearden. Eventually they meet John Galt, an engineer who had been elevated to legendary status by ""stopping the motor of the world"" in encouraging other individualists to drop out, and who delivers the novel's showstopping 50-page speech -- an expansive summary of Rand's philosophy. Upon the book's release it divided critics and readers, some of whom praised its message of self-sufficiency. More, however, disliked Rand's politics and atheism, not to mention her writing. ""Is it a novel? Is it a nightmare? Is it Superman -- in the comic-strip or the Nietzschean version?"" Time magazine asked in its review, adding that Rand's ""philosophy must be read to be disbelieved. ... She deserves credit at least for imagination; unfortunately, it is tied to ludicrous naivety."" But Rand's book -- which followed 1943's ""The Fountainhead,"" about a Frank Lloyd Wright-like architect determined to follow his own path -- was a best seller and has continued to be significant. In 1991, a Library of Congress/Book-of-the-Month Club survey named it No. 2 among respondents' most influential books, after the Bible. Her philosophy of selfishness and her love of pure capitalism (she used to wear a dollar-sign brooch) has earned her many followers, particularly on the right. Rush Limbaugh is a fan; former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was a Rand acolyte in his younger days and a member of her New York salon. But Rand critics are equally fervent, questioning her belief in pure free markets. ""What I find so remarkable about it is if capitalism can work on its own without any government regulation, then we wouldn't be here,"" said economist Heather Boushey of the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Boushey points out that even Greenspan has reversed course, to an extent, in his admiration of laissez-faire economics. ""Those of us who have looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholders' equity -- myself, especially -- are in a state of shocked disbelief,"" Greenspan told a congressional hearing in October. The Rand Institute's Brook points out that, to Rand, selfishness did not mean disengagement from the world or sociopathy. ""Rational self-interest, egoism, in Ayn Rand's perception is not being Bernie Madoff, not thinking short-term and satisfying just whims, and cheating and lying and stealing,"" he said. ""It is about pursuing what's truly in your rational, long-term self-interest, figuring out what's good for you, without exploiting, taking advantage, without stealing from other people, without sacrificing from other people to yourself. ""But also,"" he added, ""without sacrificing yourself to other people."" iReport.com: Tribute to favorite book ""Atlas Shrugged"" It's that debate over shared sacrifice that will likely continue to fuel Rand's critics, as well as her admirers. At bookstores, it will likely keep cash registers ringing, which could only have made the dollar-sign-wearing author very happy, indeed.

"(CNN) -- One of two 12-year-old Wisconsin girls accused of stabbing a third girl repeatedly after reading online horror stories is not competent to stand trial, a doctor reported to the court handling the case. But the court-ordered report on Morgan Geyser's competency -- mentioned in a hearing in Waukesha on Wednesday -- isn't the final word on the matter, as Judge Michael Bohren granted the prosecution a chance to challenge the finding in an August 1 hearing. Also Wednesday, Bohren granted the prosecution's request for doctors to examine Geyser again, this time to determine whether she has a ""mental disease or defect"" that could have an impact on the case. Prosecutor Susan Opper requested the new examination, noting that the competency report doesn't address whether Geyser is mentally ill. Further details about the report aren't publicly available, as the court has sealed it. Geyser and Annisa Weier are charged as adults with attempted first-degree intentional homicide, accused of stabbing a 12-year-old schoolmate in a Waukesha park 19 times and leaving her to crawl to her own rescue in late May. After being hospitalized for days, the victim is recuperating at home, her family has said. Both defendants were silent, handcuffed and wearing blue jail clothes, as they attended separate procedural hearings Wednesday morning. Neither defendant has entered a plea, as lawyers for both sides have tried to deal with Geyser's competency and procedural matters ahead of an official preliminary hearing. Both are being held with bail set at $500,000. Weier's attorneys haven't asked the court to determine whether she is competent, but her lawyer Joseph Smith Jr. told Bohren on Wednesday that he reserved the right to do so. Weier's defense team has said it will try to move her case to juvenile court, and Smith said Weier's competency could come up as part of that attempt. Like Geyser, Weier is next due in court August 1, when Weier's attorneys are expected to tell Bohren how much more time they need to prepare for a plea hearing. Bohren ordered that the new report on Geyser's mental health be completed before her August 1 hearing. Authorities said one of the girls held the victim down while another stabbed her 19 times on May 31, allegedly so that the girls could impress a fictitious, ghoulish Internet character called Slenderman. The victim was taken to a hospital after a passing bicyclist found her, police said. The suspects were arrested hours after the victim was discovered, according to a criminal complaint. One of the girls encountered the name on a website known as Creepypasta Wiki, authorities said. One of the suspects allegedly told police that Slenderman is the site's supposed leader, and to climb into his realm, a user must kill someone.

"(CNN) -- Step aside, Willy Wonka. According to its creator, Vosges chocolate is not just chocolate, it's ""an experiential chocolate story-telling vehicle that's meant to be indulgent and sensual and opening to the mind."" More than that, 38-year-old company founder Katrina Markoff intends to ""break down stereotypes through chocolate."" Having traveled around the world, Markoff's goal is to get people to try the exotic flavors she discovered, something that's more achievable if those flavors are enrobed in chocolate. Among her best-selling items is a truffle collection that includes sweet Hungarian paprika and Chinese star anise, fennel and pastis confections. While chocolate with once-unusual ingredients like chilli or sea salt is now increasingly commonplace, when Markoff first tried selling her product to department store Nieman Marcus in Chicago in 1998, she recalls ""the guy looking at me like I'm crazy when I'm telling him what's in it."" But today, Markoff's product sells through 2,000 outlets worldwide, and in eight dedicated boutiques. Last year, her business made $30 million, up 50% on the previous year. This year, she has brought the Vosges experience to a mass market, launching a new, less expensive brand that will sell in places like Walmart and Target. Where a box of 16 Vosges truffles costs $40, a 2oz bar of Wild Ophelia, which features flavors such as beef jerky and BBQ potato chips, is $3.99. More from Leading Women: The woman hunting the Higgs boson . A Vanderbilt University chemistry and psychology major, Markoff moved to Paris upon graduating, to study cuisine and patisserie. On the advice of renowned chef Ferran Adrià, who ran what was regularly described as the world's greatest restaurant, El Bulli, in Spain, Markoff toured Southeast Asia and Australia. In keeping with her international perspective, Markoff plans to devote her next few years to cultivating cacao in Haiti, and opening a lodge in Belize where tourists can learn about chocolate making. Here, she tells CNN about how she came up with her winning concept. On her first chocolate epiphany ... I had my first chocolate experience in the Place des Vosges (in Paris). I went to this restaurant called L'Ambroisie and they had taken chocolate ganache (which is like the center of the truffle), they froze it and dipped it in a beignet batter and fried it. That experience of eating this donut-crusty exterior and, when you bit down, this molten explosion of chocolate ... that started piquing my curiosity about chocolate. On her second chocolate epiphany... It wasn't until I got back from my trip and moved to Dallas to get a job with my uncle that I realized there was no innovation going on in chocolate. He wanted me to find chocolate for his catalog business, and (everything) was just loaded with sugars and artificial flavorings and extracts and wax, and there was no story. I had all these spices from my travels, and this necklace from the Naga tribes in India. (They told me it was made out of shells, turns out it was all tigers' teeth). There was a lot of struggle over territory and missionaries tried to get them into new religions, and I was just like ""we shouldn't kill culture like that."" I went into my kitchen that night and made a curry and coconut truffle. I decided to pay homage to the Naga people and call it Naga. Everything made sense in that moment: there was this illuminated path that said ""just use chocolate as a medium to tell stories."" I ended up working on 20 different flavor profiles that night -- saffron with white chocolate and sugar crystals to represent Gaudi's mosaic work, a Hungarian paprika and chocolate ginger -- all based on my travel experiences. The next day I went into work and brought this collection of chocolates. Dallas in 1997 was still very much a BBQ town, and these people were like ""I am not trying that curry thing."" I got one woman to try it. She took a bite and her face went from disgust and worry to awe and surprise to ""Oh my God, this is actually good."" She was like ""let me try wasabi."" She was totally open to try whatever, and it was really, really cool to see that. On how to succeed ... I think it's really important for women to have confidence in her individuality and not try to conform to being someone she thinks she needs to be, to compete in the legal world or in the corporate world. It's so important to find your own voice. People respect it so much. People are very attracted to people who are passionate in their own way, that are respectful, but that are smart and speak their mind. You have this guiding light within yourself. Always go to that as your sounding board and your voice of truth. Follow that instinctual space in your solar plexus -- you know, that place that says what you need to do is right or wrong. Following that gut instinct is so critical. You have to have your little niche and carve it out and then follow it with all your heart and success will come to you. On her management style ... I've been told I can be a little ""big picture"" for some people, because I think things can get done very quickly and I want them done very quickly. I don't rely on other people's opinions or consumer research to make new products, which is somewhat unusual ... I don't always follow processes. I skip steps, and I always make last-minute changes -- and usually that's the right thing to do.","Katrina Markoff hopes to promote cross-cultural understanding using chocolate.

"(CNN) -- As noted philosopher Vincent Vega said in ""Pulp Fiction,"" the French may not know what a Quarter Pounder is. But McDonald's customers in Paris can now pay for a Royale with Cheese using their smartphones or tablets -- a concept that could spread to the company's 33,500 locations worldwide if the fast-food leader likes the results. Customers at 30 locations in France are now able to order their meals using the McDonald's mobile app, pay for it via PayPal, then join a separate line to pick up their food, according to a Reuters report. The trial is part of a rapidly growing consumer-service trend of skipping cash, and even credit cards, in favor of a quick tap from a mobile phone. Major retailers from Target to Best Buy to 7-Eleven have teamed up to create the Merchant Customer Exchange. The group is developing a mobile app that would allow customers to pay for goods at participating stores' registers with their smartphones. The app will also give users exclusive coupons and deals. Square, a mobile app and phone attachment created by one of the founders of Twitter, is gaining traction as a tool for small businesses to accept credit-card payments and this month signed a deal with Starbucks for the coffee behemoth to begin accepting payments through the app. And Google Wallet aims to be no less than a single tool that turns your phone into your wallet, driver's license and house key. PayPal, long a leader in Web transactions, is fighting to stay in the forefront of the mobile-payment game. In addition to the McDonald's deal, PayPal has signed up with such retailers as Home Depot. McDonald's showcased an even more in-depth mobile payment app earlier this year at a conference in Orlando, Reuters reports.","McDonald's is testing a mobile-payment app in France .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Lisa Michelle Hatchell disappeared on her 37th birthday: July 19, 2003. She was last seen at 10 p.m. on the street outside the Southwest Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, rowhome she shared with her boyfriend. Lisa Michelle Hatchell has been missing since her birthday in 2003. Police have looked for her in Georgia. She and her boyfriend were arguing over money, witnesses told police. Since that night, Hatchell's family and friends have not heard from the mother of two. Hatchell was a U.S. Army veteran who struggled with drug addiction. But Alonie Watson doesn't think her daughter's drug problem had anything to do with her disappearance. ""She has never disappeared without letting the family know where she is,"" Watson said. ""This is just not like her. I feel in my heart that her disappearance doesn't have anything to do with her taking drugs that night and then running away. She just wouldn't do that."" She worked at the Philadelphia Navy Yard for a while, got married and then divorced. She had been living with her boyfriend, a construction worker, for a dozen years, Watson said. Her children did not live with them. Her 16-year-old son lived with his father. Her daughter, 7 at the time of Hatchell's disappearance, lived with Watson. Watson is convinced that her daughter was the victim of foul play. She said Philadelphia police did not officially open an investigation into her daughter's case until two years after she was reported missing. And so, her boyfriend was not questioned or their home searched until two years after Hatchell disappeared. Capt. John Darby, who heads the Philadelphia police department's special victims unit, said the ""long-term missing"" unit began looking into Hatchell's disappearance in fall 2005. Earlier, the case had been handled by the local precinct. Watch an update on the case . There were two reported sightings of Lisa Hatchell in March 2006, when tipsters placed her at an apartment complex in Atlanta, Georgia. Philadelphia investigators traveled to Atlanta, but the tips grew cold when an assistant manager at the complex couldn't confirm that she had been living there. The trail led back to Atlanta in early 2008, when another tipster said she might be working as a waitress. Police are also talking to authorities in New Jersey but have developed no solid leads. Darby said the boyfriend, Tyrone Henderson, voluntarily took a polygraph test, but the results have not been made public. Watch how Henderson is still considered a person of interest . Henderson, who has moved from the rowhouse he shared with Hatchell, could not be reached. He has not hired a lawyer, police said . Hatchell is described as an African-American female standing 5'4"" tall and weighing 135 pounds. She has black hair and black eyes. When she disappeared, she was wearing her hair in a red weave or braids. She has small scars on her ankles from insect bites and a small scar on her neck. She also has double pierced ears and a birthmark on her right thigh. Anyone who can provide information on Lisa Michelle Hatchell's whereabouts or the identities of the person or people responsible for her disappearance is asked to call the Philadelphia Police Department at 215-685-3251, 3252 or 3258.","Search has taken police to Atlanta, Georgia .

"(CNN) -- Here's a Googley vision for the future: . ""We definitely hope one day you can walk out of the house with your phone in your hand -- and nothing else,"" said Marc Freed-Finnegan, the company's product manager for Google Wallet. It aims to digitize everything in your pockets in coming years by collapsing all that paper, plastic and metal into one device: the smartphone. The idea of using the mobile phone as a credit card, driver's license, transit pass, digital coupon collector, house key, hotel key, corporate ID and more probably sounds pretty sci-fi-futurey. But it's almost practical when you consider the history of the smartphone. Since the Apple iPhone debuted in 2007 (it's considered by most tech analysts to be the first true smartphone, running apps and functioning as a pocket computer), technologists have been cramming ever more functionality into these Swiss Army Knife-like gadgets. Our phones have replaced many other once-common tools, from GPS devices (remember those?) to handheld gaming consoles, point-and-shoot cameras, calendars, notebooks, newspapers and portable music players. Now they're conquering new territory, most notably the wallet. From there, who knows? Analysts expect phones to get so smart that they could delay your alarm clock if an airline delays your morning flight. Apple's new ""humble personal assistant,"" named Siri, is a step in that direction. And technologists are working on phone prototypes that could be built into clothing, could project their screens on your skin or, in the way-off future, would have flexible and stretchable screens. ""Mobile phones are definitely becoming a center of all of our lives, I think,"" Freed-Finnegan said. ""When you're carrying around this small computer, you can do all kinds of things with it."" The phone-as-wallet trend started in South Korea and Japan about five years ago, and it's been talked about in the U.S. for some time. But it only became a reality September 19, when the Google Wallet app went public for Nexus S smartphones on Sprint's network. That's a relatively small subset of people (Google wouldn't say how many), but the company says it's just an early implementation of what's to come. Here's how it works at checkout: . Instead of pulling out a credit card to pay for your purchase, you get out your phone. Then you tap it on an NFC reader (these are becoming more common in stores and are usually labeled ""PayPass"" along with a little radio-wave icon) to log the payment. You have to enter a PIN for security. Google Wallet currently works only with Citi MasterCard. Google also has a prepaid card of its own that you can load up with money from a bank or credit card account. Some reviewers say the service is clunky. ""Other forms of payment are easier and quicker,"" said Jeff Blyskal, a senior editor at Consumer Reports, who tested Google Wallet in San Francisco. ""I don't think the Google wallet or any of these digital wallets are going to replace your leather wallet,"" he said. ""I just don't think it will happen."" The phone-wallet technology is promising and probably will be a significant part of the mobile future, but it has to get easier to use, said Will Stofega, director of mobile device technology and trends at IDC, an analyst firm. ""I think the phone as wallet is a good place to start, and one of the things that has to happen is it has to be easy ... and it has to be accepted all over,"" he said. Google says Google Wallet will continue to develop. The company hopes that, at some point, this smartphone app will carry loyalty cards and digital coupons so someone could just tap their phone and, all at once, also get discounts from a grocery store loyalty program or spend a Groupon deal they had in the queue. In the longer term, the company and others hope to jam the rest of the contents of your pockets -- identification cards, transit passes, keys and the like -- into your phone, too. The details are far from worked out, but a phone with an NFC chip could be used to unlock doors and to identify a person. (Here's one reason Google Wallet isn't all that popular yet; only a handful of smartphones in the U.S. have such a chip in them, including the Google Nexus S and two BlackBerry models, which don't work with Google Wallet.) For a hotel key, a clerk could transfer a key permission to the guest's phone upon check-in. Then the phone would communicate with a door lock in the same way it would with a cashier: by passing identifying information back and forth and unlocking the door. Lots of hardware and industry standards might need to be changed to make something like that happen. And there will probably be security issues as well. Even more complicated would be the phone-based drivers' license, since state governments would need to approve that. Google said there would obviously also have to be some form of authentication technology employed so the digital license couldn't be faked. That's a long way out, Freed-Finnegan said. But the company thinks the digital wallet is a smart place to begin. ""We're really just getting started,"" he said.","Already-useful smartphones are conquering new territory, most notably the wallet .
Phones can replace your credit card, driver's license, transit pass, keys, coupons and more .

"(CNN) -- Amid the whine of F3 engines and the clatter of pneumatic tools, 21-year-old Sun Zheng -- one of mainland China's small but growing pack of motor racing drivers -- considers his form for the next day's racing at the Macau Grand Prix. ""My time wasn't very good and there were three corners we kept missing,"" he tells CNN from the relative calm of the Galaxy Double R Racing Team's catering tent. ""If I solve those three corners, I'll be two seconds off the pace."" As the first F3 racer from mainland China to enter the Macau fixture - roundly regarded as the sport's toughest training ground for Formula One drivers -- Zheng has a lot resting on his young shoulders. ""Of course, all F3 drivers want to be F1 drivers and Macau is like doing college,"" he says, adding that his ambition is to become China's first F1 driver at a Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)-sanctioned event. ""Most older drivers have done three or four years and then they graduate to F1. I hope I'll be first. I have driven in Formula Ones and nothing can compare with it -- it's in a different category,"" he says. As the reigning China Formula Grand Prix series champion, fourth place-getter in the final 2012 Audi R8 LMS Cup and this year's national champion in the British F3, Zheng has already shown the kind of form that could take him to the pinnacle of motor racing. At the moment, however, he needs all his concentration for Macau which he says is one of the most challenging circuits in the world. Even at the tender age of 21, he says the rigors of the track leave him exhausted at the end of the day's racing. ""Physically I'm okay but mentally I'm very tired because you're not just driving the car - it's not like qualifying or practice -- when you race you have to try to overtake, you have to try to defend, you need to think about a lot of things in a very short space of time. ""When you take risks, it's not like you can just do that blindly,"" he says. ""You have to think, 'Okay well ... I have a 60-70% chance I'm going to go for it.'"" As a street circuit, the concrete canyons of Macau's Guia Circuit can throw up some chilling moments, even for experienced drivers who take some corners at upwards of 240 kph (150 mph) on each lap. ""You have to really push every corner and every lap during the race because the older drivers, the pace that they keep up is incredible,"" Zheng says. ""They are preparing for Formula One races so they can't make mistakes -- they're not just fast on one lap, they're fast on every corner and every lap. ""I have done endurance races where you have a lot of time to take a rest; you're not competing with the car next to you. But in F3, once you start, it's a fight to the end. ""When I start, I take a breath when the right light goes off and I push and push until the checkered flag comes down and then I let that breath out -- it really does feel like that."" With 15 laps at around two minutes a lap, 30 minutes might seem like a long time to hold your breath but, as Zheng explains, Macau is that kind of circuit. ""On other tracks, there's a white line on both sides of the circuit -- if you take a short cut and your four wheels go over the white line, then that's a penalty,"" he says. ""But in Macau, the white line is a wall -- not even two wheels can go over; it's really difficult."" Double R Racing team manager Anthony Hieatt says his team has had some hair-raising moments at the Macau Grand Prix in the past. ""Crashes? Oh God yeah. Massive crashes. Huge ones,"" says Hieatt amid the drone of the F3 garage. ""This is the toughest circuit in the world bar none -- it's probably one of the longest circuits with 23 or 24 corners and parts of it are like putting cotton through a needle. The good drivers, he says, will always stand out. ""Good experienced drivers are always up the front and new drivers are always at the back. New drivers need experience so they come back two or three times but if you do succeed at Macau, then all the Formula One people are watching -- it's a calling card for your career."" His team currently holds the record for the highest speed ever attained at Macau at 182 mph (292 kph) which through the narrow historic streets of the former Portuguese colony is about as fast as it gets. ""To put it in perspective, they don't reach those sorts of speeds at Monaco,"" says Hieatt, adding that intense concentration is fundamental to every driver's survival at Macau. ""As soon as the driver feels they're safe, they're in the morgue,"" he says. While advances in the carbon fiber monocoque design have made the racers safer than they were 20, and even 10 years ago (F3 racers now fitted with thick panels that protect drivers from intrusions into the cockpit), the last thing a driver wants is 'to go in', says Hieatt using the pit vernacular for having a crash. ""It's still a dangerous sport and it still hurts when you go in, but the cars are among the safest in the world."" For Hieatt, F3 -- as the poor man's Formula One -- represents the real, gritty spirit of motor racing in its purest form. ""Here we're dealing with raw talent,"" he says. ""The F1 drivers always remember F3 because there's this fantastic bonding that goes on because they work with a small team. ""In Formula One, the mechanics wouldn't even speak with the drivers, but here they eat, drink and sleep with the team. It's really the university of racing.""","Sun Zheng is the first F3 racer from mainland China to enter the Macau Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Fernando Torres was rewarded for his goal in Spain's 2-0 friendly win over Bolivia with a place in the 23-man squad for its defense of the World Cup in Brazil. The Chelsea striker got the nod from coach Vicente Del Bosque Saturday despite an indifferent season for his club side Chelsea. Atletico Madrid's Diego Costa, who is struggling with a hamstring injury and club teammate David Villa are also included as strikers. But there was disappointment for another trio of front men, Manchester City pair Jesus Navas and Alvaro Negredo and Fernando Llorente of Juventus. Midfielder Ander Iturraspe, and defenders Alberto Moreno and Dani Carvajal have also been excluded from the provisional 30 named by Del Bosque. But the spotlight was on Torres -- who has scored just 20 goals in 110 games since his $84 million move to Chelsea. His appearance against Bolivia Friday night in Sevilla was his first appearance for the world champions since the Confederation Cup nearly a year ago. The Chelsea striker put in a generally lively performance at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan Stadium and after Bayern Munich's Javi Martinez was pulled down in the penalty area, Torres scored from the spot on 51 minutes. But moments later Torres showed the other side of his game, his lack of confidence in front of goal. Put through by man of the match Andres Iniesta, Torres attempted a chipped finish over the head of Bolivian goalkeeper Romel Quininez, but made a horrible hash of it, sending it high and wide. Torres held his head in his hands, but the miss did not prove significant and Iniesta wrapped up the victory with a stunning goal six minutes from time. In a pointer to his final selection, Del Bosque gave a positive verdict on Torres, who has played in the last two World Cups and scored 37 goals for his country. ""We have a lot of confidence in him and that's why he is here,"" Del Bosque told gathered reporters after the win. ""We are pleased with how he worked tonight,"" he added. Spain opens its defense of the World Cup with a tough match against the Netherlands on June 13, a repeat of the 2010 final in which Iniesta scored the only goal of the game. Meanwhile, England got its preparations for Brazil off to a good start with a comfortable 3-0 win over Peru at Wembley. Daniel Sturridge scored a stunning first half opener for Roy Hodgson's men == the third goal in his last five starts for England for the Liverpool star. Central defenders Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka were on target after the break after well-delivered corners troubled the South American visitors.. Bosnia-Herzegovina was also boosted by a 2-1 success against fellow finalists Ivory Coast. Its talisman Edin Dzeko grabbed goals in either half before Didier Drogba pulled one back for the Ivorians in the final minute.","Fernando Torres in Spain World Cup squad .

"Murrieta, California (CNN) -- The busloads of detained immigrants never arrived. For that, six protesters and counterprotesters got themselves arrested, Murrieta police said. Almost all day Friday, two factions of demonstrators endured a hot July 4th holiday verbally sparring over an anticipated convoy of buses carrying detained immigrants who are a part of a surge in illegal border crossings. Instead, the migrants were rerouted for processing at the federal San Ysidro facility in San Diego, reported the Los Angeles Times, citing a law enforcement source. The migrants had been expected to be processed at Murrieta's U.S. Border Patrol station, 75 miles north of the Mexican border, but federal officials declined Saturday to say where the buses took the migrants. Friday's angry protests was the second public outrcy of the week in the small southern California town of Murrieta, becoming the nation's newest flashpoint in its immigration crisis. The first protests occurred Tuesday after the city and Mayor Alan Long posted on the city's website a notice stating that ""Murrieta Opposes Illegal Immigrant Arrival."" Long said in a website statement that Murrieta ""continues to object to the transfer of illegal immigrants to the local border patrol office,"" and he blamed the nation's immigration woes on ""a failure to enforce federal law at the federal level."" At Tuesday's protest, a group of protesters overwhelmed law officers and successfully prevented three busloads of detained Central Americans from entering Murrieta. The migrants were instead sent to the San Ysidro site in San Diego, said an official with the National Border Patrol Council, the union for border agents. Tuesday marked the first day of a federal initiative to transfer 140 migrants every 72 hours for processing in Murrieta. Federal officials initially sought to send 500 detained immigrants every 72 hours for processing in Murrieta, but city officials opposed that, the mayor said. The migrants rejected by Murrieta protesters initially had been held in Texas, where U.S. facilities are overflowing, forcing detainees to be sent to other states for processing. A recent tide of Central Americans illegally entering the United States has overwhelmed a federal immigration system already buckling under the weight of the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented migrants. Unlike undocumented Mexican migrants, who are often immediately deported, the United States detains and processes Central Americans, who are eventually released and given a month to report to immigration offices. Many never show up and join the undocumented population, according to the National Border Patrol Council.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Nicole Ganguzza was a newlywed in grad school at the University of Central Florida when she was dragged off a trail and strangled to death while jogging in a park in June. Nicole Ganguzza, 26, was studying to be a family therapist at the time of her death. Ganguzza, 26, was close to earning her master's degree in marriage and family therapy. She was looking forward to having children of her own. She left class on June 10 at about 5:35 p.m. Ten minutes later, she called husband Brendan Ganguzza and told him she was going jogging at Jay Blanchard Park, not far from the university's campus in Orlando, Florida. Brendan Ganguzza became worried at about 7 p.m. when he couldn't reach his wife on her phone. He searched the park for two hours, calling police at about 9 p.m. Police combed the brush through the evening, and the search the next day grew to 60 people. Her body was found behind the post office, about two miles from where her Mitsubishi Eclipse was parked and just off the Econlockhatchee Trail where she'd been jogging.  Watch for the clues » . Brendan Ganguzza became a widower at 30. He is working hard to keep her memory alive. ""It's hard sometimes because you can feel very much in the dark about what is going on, wondering if you'll ever get answers,"" he told CNN. ""We've started a foundation in Nicole's name to continue her dream of providing free counseling and therapy to those who can't afford it. She was studying to be a counselor,"" he added. Nicole Ganguzza was killed five days before toddler Caylee Anthony was reported missing. That case grabbed the headlines in Orlando -- and beyond. Investigators wove a web of circumstantial evidence and charged the child's mother, Casey Anthony, the notorious ""tot mom"" whose wild party pictures became a cable news show staple. Writing recently about the charitable foundation established in Nicole Ganguzza's name, an Orlando Sentinel columnist described her as ""the anti-Casey."" Police say her killer deliberately hid her body in the brush along the trail. Investigators believe the killer either is from the area or is very familiar with the park and nearby campus. The Orange County Medical Examiner characterized Ganguzza's death as a homicide by strangulation without elaborating. It is not publicly known whether she had been sexually assaulted. ""We are keeping very quiet about this because this is information that only the killer would know,"" said Orange County sheriff's spokesman Carlos Padilla. Last week, Ganguzza's family and friends asked anyone with information to come forward and help solve this cold case. They expressed relief that the police may have a break in the case and that an arrest could come soon. ""I just hope they make an arrest soon in my wife's case, so they can get this dangerous guy off the streets,"" Brendan Ganguzza said. Police executed a search warrant two weeks ago on the mobile home of a man who is considered a person of interest in the case. His home lies along the Econlockhatchee Trail. He is a former student and employee of the University of Central Florida. Police say that after reviewing tips and leads, they believe they have probable cause to investigate this individual further. ""The search warrant is sealed, and I can't say at this time what evidence was collected or what led us to this individual,"" said Cpl. Susan Soto, a spokeswoman for the Orange County sheriff. Police are being tight-lipped about whether Ganguzza's attacker left behind any DNA or other forensic evidence. Police are still asking for the public's help in solving this case.

"(CNN) -- This week, the country witnessed one of the most irresponsible acts that we have seen from this Republican Congress, since they deliberately shut down the government less than a year ago. Republican House Speaker John Boehner informed President Barack Obama that he would not bring a vote on immigration reform to the floor this year. Whatever excuse Speaker Boehner has for abdicating his responsibility as a national leader, it is not good enough, and he has now given the President ample excuse to act on his own. Which he is now doing. Since Republicans in Congress refuse to do their job and allow a vote on comprehensive immigration reform this year, Obama, on behalf of the American people, is acting on his own to address this important issue -- for the well-being of our country, our economy and the immigrant community that has contributed so much to our economic growth and prosperity and is suffering greatly from a badly broken system. A family secret that changed his life . Republicans had a year to either bring the Senate immigration bill to the House floor, or come up with an approach of their own that would deal with the different moving pieces necessary to fix our broken immigration system. Obama and Democrats were willing to compromise at every corner -- and despite disapproval from advocates and allies -- even held off on pressuring Republicans in hopes that would help create space for reform. But it didn't work. Opinion: Like those children, I too fled Central America . No matter what they did, the GOP refused to move. Republicans chose to play politics and spew excuses, rather than honor the will of the majority of the American people and pass such needed reform. In 2013 they said they didn't have enough time in the legislative calendar to pass reform, but they did have time to shut down the government which cost us $24 billion. Then, Republican leadership announced they wouldn't move on immigration reform unless the majority of the Republican caucus supported it, even though the votes were there to pass reform and poll after poll showed the majority of the American people support reforming our immigration system. All of this while promising they would bring up legislation. Earlier this year we were encouraged by Republicans putting out their immigration principles -- which were less than ideal but which the President and Democrats were willing to discuss. A week later Republicans said they couldn't move on immigration reform because they couldn't trust the President to enforce the law. This is the same President who advocates have hit hard over his record number of deportations and enforcement policies. According to that measure, the GOP should have been thrilled. But it also exposed the rampant hypocritical nature of their excuse not to act. And then there's the biggest excuse of all: border security first. Never mind that border security is stronger than ever. Never mind that the Senate bill the GOP refused to bring up for a vote in the House would have doubled the amount of agents on the border to 40,000 and provided an extra $38 billion dollars to increase border security. Republicans have used every excuse in the book to block a bill that would have actually addressed their biggest priorities when it comes to immigration reform -- border security, enforcement, employment verification, high tech visas etc. But even with that in mind, they'd rather point fingers that get something done. It makes no sense. So after more than a year of excuses and delays, we at least have clarity on something Americans have suspected all along: The anti-immigrant extremist faction of the GOP is calling the shots, making it impossible for Republicans to deliver any real substantive action on this issue. Make no mistake, Republicans should understand something very clearly: In killing immigration reform, Speaker Boehner and the GOP are not only killing the hopes of millions of immigrants in this country counting on reform to allow them to fully come out of the shadows and shield them and their families from deportations, but the GOP is in effect committing long-term institutional political suicide and saying ""adios"" to any chance of the GOP capturing the White House in 2016. Even the GOP's self-interest was not enough to motivate them to support and lead on the issue. It became clear that there is no option left, and that the GOP has been playing us all along as they have no intention to pass reform. Ya basta. No more. Let's be clear, the President did not want to act alone. He did everything he could to work with Republicans in Congress and he knows that a long term permanent solution has to be legislative, but he also knows that if Congress won't act, he has to. As Obama himself said, ""America cannot wait forever for them to act."" The American people and the immigrant community support reform, and want brave leaders who are willing to fight for them and do the hard work. The President proved that he's willing to go to bat for immigration reform. He will act because the GOP won't. The country deserves better. Mr. President, America is behind you on this every step of the way. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Maria Cardona explains why Republicans forced the president to act on immigration .

"(CNN) -- A pair of commercial jetliners got closer than regulations allow in the skies near George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, the Federal Aviation Administration said Saturday. The FAA said in a statement that it was investigating Thursday night's ""loss of required separation"" between planes in airspace controlled by Houston Terminal Radar Approach Control. At 6:51 p.m., the pilot of Singapore Airlines Flight 61 took off and did not level off at an altitude of 4,000 feet as required, the FAA said. At the same time, Delta Air Lines Flight 2443 was inbound to the airport at an altitude of 6,000 feet. ""An air traffic controller noticed the deviation and issued traffic alerts and instructions to the pilots of both aircraft,"" the statement said.

"(CNN) -- This year's roster of awards show nominees are more diverse than has probably ever before been seen in Hollywood. Films featuring mostly African-American casts such as ""12 Years a Slave,"" ""Fruitvale Station,"" ""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom"" and ""Lee Daniels' The Butler"" have seen both their projects and their actors rack up plenty of critical praise and some nominations. But does diversity really count if a film or its stars are passed over for the win? During Sunday night's Golden Globes ""12 Years a Slave"" was nominated for seven awards, but snagged only one, though it was the biggest of the night: best motion picture, drama. ""Losing again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again was crushing for the '12 Years a Slave' crew,"" Entertainment Weekly noted of the scene at the awards show. ""By the time the final award was presented -- Best Drama -- many at the Fox event were only half paying attention. They had passed the other stages of grief and settled on 'acceptance.'"" Being passed over for wins can happen to any movie, but when it happens to a critically acclaimed film about slavery with a mostly black cast, the issue of race can't help but become a part of the conversation. Especially when the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which runs the Globes, and the Academy Awards voting body also gave no nods to ""Lee Daniels' The Butler"" and ""Fruitvale Station,"" both of which were popular with critics. ""Oprah (Winfrey, who was heralded for her performance in 'The Butler') was such a sure thing for Gold Derby's Experts that she came in first place for a nomination as far back as September 1...,"" wrote site Gold Derby, which handicaps the award races. Undoubtedly, there would be some snubs with such a strong year for films in Hollywood. But even beyond those nominated there is the issue of the importance of actually scoring a trophy. Jeff Friday is founder and chief executive officer of Film Life, Inc., which sponsors the annual American Black Film Festival (ABFF). He said that while this season has turned out to be ""a phenomenal year as it relates to diversity in cinema,"" that doesn't ensure those films will be noted. ""This is what I would call a banner year for black cinema,"" Friday said. ""But what is a banner year in the theaters does not always translate to that same level of accolade as it relates to awards season. I was pleased to see the number and breadth of nominees, but was not at all surprised to see that the black films didn't win (at the Golden Globes)."" This is an era when USA Today can cause an uproar by referring, as they did in a headline, to the mostly black cast film ""The Best Man Holiday"" as ""race-themed"" and where ""Saturday Night Live"" held special casting for black actresses after complaints that the show lacked diversity. Oscar nominations will be announced on Thursday and the Los Angeles Times reports that ""despite recent efforts by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to expand and diversify its ranks, the overall group of 6,028 Academy Award voters remains much more white than the diverse group of filmmakers likely to be shortlisted for the best work in 2013's movies."" Special coverage: Awards season 2014 . ""Even with the 432 new voting members, the overall academy is still 93% white, a decrease of less than 1% from what The Times found in a 2012 membership study, and 76% male, also a less than 1% decrease from what The Times found two years ago,"" said a story from the Times published in December with the headline ""Diversity efforts slow to change the face of Oscar voters."" Film Independent is an organization that helps filmmakers make films and recognizes their work with the Film Independent Spirit Awards. The organization's president, Josh Welsh, said the importance of diversity cannot be overstated. ""A healthy thriving film culture is one that embodies diversity where multiple voices and people from different parts of the country, and different ethnic backgrounds, sexual orientation, age and income are represented,"" he said. ""The more diverse the pool of filmmakers is, the richer the film culture is."" For that reason Film Independent actively works on increasing diversity behind the camera and has several programs including Project Involve, which seeks to cultivate talent from underrepresented communities. And while Welsh said it's great to see more diversity in this year's nominees, he believes it matters whether or not the awards are actually garnered. ""As a culture we have a long way to go,"" he said. ""Diversity is a problem -- the access people have to making films, getting their story told and getting recognition. There's a reason we keep diversity as a part of our mission because the work is not done. It's fantastic that these films and filmmakers are getting nominated and what's most important is that these films are getting into theaters and connecting with audiences."" NPR television critic Eric Deggans pointed out in a recent piece on its website that ""it is a landmark year in one sense: We are seeing more people of color nominated for major awards than we have in the past,"" while also noting that black actors Chiwetel Ejiofor and Idris Elba were nominated in both film and TV categories at the Golden Globes. ""There are ... certain actors of color who've been embraced by Hollywood, and maybe it's time to spread that wealth around a little bit and get a wider range of actors involved in these big projects,"" Deggans said. Friday is already looking ahead to 2014 with concern that there doesn't appear to be as much diversity on tap in the big budget films as there was in 2013. His hope, he said, is that more diverse independent films will catch the eye of big studios for distribution, as was the case with ""Fruitvale Station."" He is also not waiting for Hollywood recognition as his organization is set to launch the ABFF Hollywood Awards, an online platform where the public can vote on their favorite black films and performances. ""Hollywood is an industry about mass consumption and mass acceptance, but the people who pick the best are always a very small, monolithic group, so we don't have a voice,"" Friday said. ""We should be proud of being nominated, but let's not have the illusion of inclusion.""

"(CNN) -- Dawn DaLuise's list of celebrity clients featured the Who's Who of the entertainment industry, including Jennifer Aniston and Nicki Minaj. In a Los Angeles market where looks are everything, the self-proclaimed skin-care guru to the stars relished her title and guarded it zealously. So much so that when aesthetician Gabriel Suarez set up shop in the same building as hers, tension ensued, authorities said. Tension that led, police say, to a bizarre plot. DaLuise owned Skin Refinery in West Hollywood, which provided skin care products and treatments. She was arrested in March after she allegedly wanted to have Suarez, whom she considered a competitor, killed. ""I came in and I said 'Can I help you?' because she was in my office. And she said, 'Oh good, a Mexican that speaks English.' And that hurt,"" Suarez said. ""She wanted me out of the building."" The rivalry created by his new beauty salon called Smooth Cheeks morphed into a crime thriller filled with one twist after another. It had all the bizarre elements of a Hollywood shocker: sex solicitations, an alleged plot to kill and betrayal. Convinced that Suarez was not only ruining her popularity -- but that he was also allegedly posting raunchy Craigslist ads claiming she was seeking a man to fulfill her sexual fantasies -- DaLuise tried to hire a hit man to kill him, detectives said. ""The phrase was, at that point, in essence, to find somebody to take out a double-minority Mexican gay,"" said Steve McCauley of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. But Suarez said he had nothing to do with the cyber postings. In a wild case of betrayal, it later came to light that it wasn't Suarez posting the Craigslist ads. Authorities said it was DaLuise's good friend, Edward Feinstein, who now faces charges in a separate prosecution. Her friend was creating drama so he could be the one who stepped in and saved her, Alexis Tereszcuk of Radar Online told HLN earlier this year. The online entertainment magazine broke most of the developments in the story. Police said Feinstein, who was their informant, is also linked to the case in other ways. He is also the man DaLuise texted to tell that she hired a hit man to take out her business rival. Her text to Feinstein read: ""I found someone who is going to take Gabriel out. His name is Chris Geile, and he's an ex-Detroit Lion quarterback,"" prosecutors said. But DaLuise's lawyer said that it was not a plot to kill. ""You will see that she was venting to family, she was venting to friends,"" said Jamon Hicks, her attorney. ""This was not a case she was trying to solicit someone to murder."" Geile said the accusation stunned him because he hardly knew DaLuise and had only met her briefly at a pub in Big Bear, California. ""I want to clear my name because the mental anguish I've suffered is far more than any football injury I've ever had,"" Geile said. DaLuise has pleaded not guilty and says she wants to clear her name as well. ""She's the victim of a stalker who posted fake Craigslist ads claiming she had a rape fantasy,"" Hicks said. DaLuise will be arraigned Monday on solicitation of murder charges. Her attorney says she plans to plead not guilty again.","Dawn DaLuise owned Skin Refinery in West Hollywood .

"(CNN) -- At least five people were reported killed and 30 injured Monday evening when a freak dust storm rolled through Iran's capital, Tehran.

It reported the storm plunged the city into darkness, and photographs from Tehran showed giant clouds of sand and dust clogging the air.

"(CNN) -- Although the general public may be embracing the LGBT community more these days, it doesn't look like Hollywood is keeping up. That's the message of GLAAD's 2014 Studio Responsibility Index, which charts the ""quantity, quality and diversity of images of LGBT people in films released by the seven largest motion picture studios during the 2013 calendar year."" This year's study found that of the 102 films released by the major studios in 2013, only 17 included characters identified as lesbian, gay or bisexual. And of those 17, the study concluded, most were minor characters, some of which GLAAD characterized as ""defamatory representations."" ""The lack of substantial LGBT characters in mainstream film, in addition to the outdated humor and stereotypes, suggests large Hollywood studios may be doing more harm than good when it comes to worldwide understanding of the LGBT community,"" GLAAD CEO and President Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statement. ""These studios have the eyes and ears of millions of audience members, and should reflect the true fabric of our society rather than feed into the hatred and prejudice against LGBT people too often seen around the globe."" 20th Century Fox, Lionsgate, Universal Pictures and Walt Disney Studios were graded as ""adequate"" for their portrayal of the community, while both Warner Bros. and Paramount were rated as ""failing"" for ""including only minor and offensive portrayals of LGBT."" Warner Bros. is owned by the parent company of CNN. Sony Pictures was the only studio to receive a ""good"" score for having several LGBT-inclusive films, including ""Mortal Instruments: City of Bones."" Two films, ""Riddick"" and ""Pain and Gain,"" were singled out for having offensive portrayals. Films were judged by the the organization's ""Vito Russo Test,"" named after the film historian and GLAAD co-founder. In order to pass the test, a film had to meet the following criteria: . â€¢ The film must contain a character that is identifiably lesbian, gay, bisexual and/or transgender. â€¢ That character must not be solely or predominantly defined by their sexual orientation or gender identity. i.e. They are made up of the same sort of unique character traits commonly used to differentiate straight characters from one another. â€¢ The LGBT character must be tied into the plot in such a way that their removal would have a significant effect. They are not there to simply provide colorful commentary, paint urban authenticity or (perhaps most commonly) set up a punchline. The character should ""matter."" Of the 17 films with LGBT characters, only seven passed the Vito Russo Test. The study also notes that unlike films, ""TV seems to have entered another golden age, where the programming is not only incredibly thematically diverse (and prolific), but is also fertile ground for creators to tell truly unique and innovative stories. Not by accident, it's also the best place in popular culture to find complex and resonant representations of LGBT people that connect with a mainstream audience.""

"(CNN) -- NASCAR driver Carl Edwards is currently at the top of the Sprint Cup leader board, but another driver is leading the pack in charitable endeavors -- two time champion Tony Stewart. Stewart was once named ""Most Caring Athlete"" by USA Weekend, and he is living up to the title. For the past seven years, he's made good use of his day job as a fundraising vehicle. Every summer Stewart calls on some of his friends -- who happen to be the best of the best in motorsports -- to race on the dirt and under the lights for the Prelude to the Dream at Eldora Speedway. NASCAR has roots in this track and in dirt racing. While the history in the dirt is exciting, the drivers know there is much more to gain here. ""The question why am I racing this race as opposed to other dirt races is because of the charities involved and to support Tony Stewart and his foundation,"" says NASCAR driver Brian Vickers. Fellow driver Kyle Busch says it's a date that's always penciled into his schedule. ""It's neat to have the opportunity, and [he is] thankful we can come out here for a good cause,"" he said. Stewart and his pals divide into four teams and race for the win in honor of four children's hospitals. This year, the superstars of NASCAR, NHRA, USAC and IndyCar raced to raise money for Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Levine Children's Hospital of Charlotte, Medical Center Dallas and St. Louis Children's Hospital. While each hospital will receive a portion of the proceeds, the team with the highest points wins the highest percentage. Money is raised through ticket sales and pay-per-view purchases. The event has earned a total of $3 million in its first six years. ""You know it's kind of a dual purpose for us. It's something the drivers look forward to every year, but it's more than just us having fun... We wanna have a good time, but knowing there's a bigger purpose. And there are all of these children's charities that we're able to help. That's really what makes it worth while in the end,"" Stewart says. Five time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson says he's proud of Stewart's charitable efforts and that racing for these hospitals really hits home for him. ""This can really reach out and touch so many people through the hospitals. It's brilliant. It really works well, and it has made an impact on a hospital very close to my home, the Levine Children's Hospital in Charlotte. So it's great to see this working its way back to the area where I'm from and helping so many kids,"" Johnson said. Ryan Newman races for Stewart's NASCAR team, Stewart-Haas Racing, and is an eager participant. ""I'm not a golfer, but I do love to come race a race car for charity. I'm proud to be a part of it and honored to be a guest here as a racer."" These drivers, who are usually rivals on the track, come together to raise money for these children. They also agree that Stewart sets a grand example in generosity. Carl Edwards says Stewart is a role model he looks up to and that he's shown him how to give. ""Hopefully people watching will realize that there are places in your community... that you can give to. And we're doing a big thing here, but any little bit anywhere helps,"" Edwards said. When asked if he accepts the title of role model in his charitable efforts, Stewart humbly answered that he hopes he's been one. He credits his parents for never letting him forget the people who've helped him along the way and says he feels good about being able to give back. But he's quick to share the credit for Prelude's success. ""I can't take all the credit. There are 25 guys that come here, that help make this event so successful. And they're donating their time. We try to pay for the fuel for their planes, they never let us do that. They want the proceeds to go to these kids. ""So it shouldn't be just about me being the guy that makes this work. It's always the staff.. the whole group that makes it all work. Everybody should have a piece of the credit,"" he said. Clint Bowyer won this year's race with Team St. Louis finishing first in the team competition. But Stewart's efforts continue year-round through his foundation. He started the Tony Stewart Foundation in 2004 to focus on the health of children, the welfare of animals and the future of injured drivers.","Stewart invites 25 of the best drivers in motorsports to compete for charity .

"(CNN) -- United States leaders have rightly said that defeating the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and resolving Iraq's deepening civil war will require urgent political change in Baghdad. But the military assistance that Iran and Russia are speeding to Shiite groups in Iraq imperils that change. It now appears that a majority of Iraq's political parties and Shiite religious authorities blame Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's authoritarian tendencies and exclusion of mainstream Sunni groups for the crisis, and they seek his replacement as the starting point for resolving it. But just as this political majority has begun to form against him, Iran and Russia have extended al-Maliki material and political support that insulates him from domestic political pressure and may even embolden him to try to stay on. Iran now is in a position to direct Shiite militia mobilization and integration into Iraqi security operations and to shape Iraq's military and intelligence operations through Iran's Quds Force advisers. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin's decisive action to provide attack aircraft, trainers and advisers further bolsters the Prime Minister's position. Now, al-Maliki can argue that he has international backing to rid his country of this ""terrorist"" threat by any means necessary. In fact, al-Maliki still enjoys more domestic and international legitimacy than Syria's President, Bashar al-Assad, had when the Syrian civil war began three years ago. Al-Maliki will surely amplify the significance of this weekend's purported public appearance of the notorious leader of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in Mosul to argue that the ""Islamic caliphate"" is a clear and present danger that supersedes the need to form a unity government. He will probably argue that only he can attack the caliphate threat as commander in chief and that it has to be done now, not after a protracted government formation process. He will also probably urge Iran to quiet Shiite opposition to his premiership so that he can perform the urgent work of commander in chief. Already, the security and political situation is bleak, and unfortunately, the Prime Minister is in denial about his role in creating the Sunni Revolt and fostering the rise of the Caliphate, previously known as the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham. After eight years in power, al-Maliki has not shown that he can distinguish between actual threats and imagined ones. His often-irrational fear of a Baathist return to power led him to employ an authoritarian sectarian agenda and to marginalize constructive but squabbling Sunni Arab political elites, all of which alienated the broader Sunni community and set the stage for ISIS gains. An unconstrained al-Maliki seeks to crush Sunni Arab communities, which is what he wanted to do in 2007-2008. During the ""surge"" period of 2007-08, al-Maliki repeatedly asked for U.S. air power and artillery capabilities to pound Sunni neighborhoods (both of which he was denied) while vehemently protesting the use of precision munitions in Shiite militia-controlled areas. When the International Zone received mortar fire from Sunni neighborhoods, the Baghdad Operations commander, Gen. Abud Qanbar, told coalition advisers that the Prime Minister wanted to teach the Sunni neighborhoods not to let terrorists launch mortars and rockets from their streets. These brutal tendencies are sure to come into the open again now that al-Maliki has the backing of Iran, Syria and Russia, all known for harsh tactics against civilian populations. If al-Maliki can survive the next few weeks in power, he will probably feel free to take harsh measures against the Sunni Arab community, as he believes that he is free of U.S. constraints for the first time. Given his inclinations and fears, al-Maliki may think that he has great latitude to see most problems as nails to be dealt with by Shiite hammers and that he only has to stop short of al-Assad's atrocities and abuses -- the use of chemical weapons or 200,000 casualties -- if the Syrian experience is an indicator of what will be tolerated by the U.S. and the international community. A defiant al-Maliki -- with the support of Iran, Syria and Russia and absent U.S. constraints -- will aggressively target Sunni Arabs, who in his view are active supporters of ISIS. Unfortunately, al-Maliki's removal would not diminish the influence of Iran and Tehran's Shiite militias. Iran will continue to be the key determinant of Iraqi policy and politics for Iraq's Shiite parties and Shiite militias regardless of the prime minister. Iran is skilled in power politics and in asserting Iranian prerogatives. Iranian strategic goals depend on an acquiescent and accommodating Iraqi government. If Iran were to pressure al-Maliki to step down, he would surely be replaced by someone Iran could influence. One name that is on any short list to replace al-Maliki is Tariq Najim Abdullah, an al-Maliki loyalist who as a member of his State of Law party could be expected to continue the sectarian approach to security issues and the marginalization of his political rivals, Sunni, Kurd and Shiite alike. Regardless of who the next Shiite prime minister will be, the sectarian actors responsible for executing al-Maliki's heavy-handed tactics against the Sunni population in 2006-09 are now back in key positions. We have seen a return of the ""worst of the worst,"" the very same actors the U.S. urged al-Maliki to remove and charge criminally before 2010. Although many maligned sectarian actors were reassigned or promoted out of key positions in Baghdad to safe positions in southern Iraq, it seems these sectarian enforcers have returned to the fight, with the al-Maliki government's blessing. Meanwhile, U.S influence and leverage with al-Maliki and other Shiite leaders is waning, if not altogether gone. It began to wane in 2010 when the U.S. ceded our leverage in favor of ""smart power,"" believing that reasonable Iraqi minds would prevail. The U.S. treated Iraq as a sovereign government and did not interfere with al-Maliki's decisions to use the Accountability and Justice Law (PDF) to marginalize and remove political rivals, to politicize the Iraqi Security Forces by replacing effective commanders with al-Maliki loyalists, and to renege on his promises to integrate the Sunni Awakening movement -- the so-called Sons of Iraq -- into the ministries and security forces. While the U.S. watched, the Iranians pressured al-Maliki not to sign the 2011 Status of Forces Agreement and backed his sectarian agenda of sidelining and arresting political rivals. Iran's strategic goals and dominant position, orchestrated by Quds commander Qassem Soleimani, will ensure that any Iraqi prime minister responds to Tehran's core interests. Tehran's steadfast support for Syria's al-Assad shows al-Maliki the reliability and commitment of Iran to its clients. We should view Iranian statements about an inclusive government with Sunni and Kurdish politicians as mere window dressing. The reality is that Tehran will not permit the steps necessary for fundamental constitutional reforms, power-sharing and checks on the Prime Minister's control over the security forces and intelligence apparatus. Tehran will see any such reforms as limits on Iranian influence, something the Iranians will not let happen.","Writers: Iran, Russia aid to Iraq imperils U.S. call for al-Maliki to make Iraq government inclusive .

"(EW.com) -- ""Maleficent"" managed to enchant audiences and take flight opening weekend while Seth MacFarlane's sophomore effort, ""A Million Ways to Die in the West,"" stumbled out of the gates. Disney's gothic fantasy, a PG-rated re-imagining of the classic Sleeping Beauty villain starring Angelina Jolie in the titular role, netted an estimated $70 million from 3,948 locations — $6.7 million of which was from the 347 IMAX screens. Boasting an A Cinema Score, the $180 million pic also brought in $100.6 million internationally from 47 territories (40 percent ahead of ""Oz: The Great and Powerful""), bringing its global cume to a mighty $170.6 million. It opens in China on June 20 and in Japan on July 4. ""We're feeling great,"" Dave Hollis, Disney's distribution head told EW. ""We came into the weekend thinking that we were going to do somewhere around $60 million and to end up with $70 million is a really encouraging start."" EW: Review of 'Maleficent' As far as ""Maleficent's"" demographics go, 60 percent of audiences were female, 45 percent families, and 18 percent teens. On Saturday, audiences were strong at all showings, from matinees to late night. ""It feels like there's some momentum and great word-of-mouth helping to propel the picture overall,"" said Hollis. ""It's good to see that during the daytime you can be a really meaningful option to families."" But, the late-night business is key, too, he said. It shows that it appeals to a cross-section of demographics. He added: ""It's a nod to the draw of Angelina Jolie. She has had such extraordinary passion for this role."" EW: Angelina Jolie Q&A - Bringing malevolent 'Maleficent' to life . Last weekend's shiny new comic book movie, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past,"" plummeted 64 percent in its second weekend with $32.6 million to take the No. 2 spot. Most high-opening actioners are front-loaded, so this wasn't unexpected, although it is on the higher end. Second weekend falls have been all over the place in this seven-movie franchise. For comparison's sake, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" fell nearly 67 percent in weekend two, while X-Men: First Class fell only 56 percent. But the Fox saga is doing just fine. The $200 million film has made an estimated $162 million domestically, and $500 million worldwide. Seth MacFarlane's ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" (B Cinema Score) did not fare so well, opening in third place with $17.1 million from 3,158 locations. That's less than half of what Ted opened at in 2012 ($54.4 million), and also below studio and analyst expectations, which assumed that the Western comedy would at least break $20 million. In terms of the audience, 45 percent were female and 28 percent were under 25 for the raunchy R-rated pic. Internationally, ""A Million Ways"" opened in 21 territories and brought in $10.3 million, bringing its worldwide total to $27.4 million. Westerns are historically a tricky genre to track, and combined with the fact that MacFarlane is an untested lead (as himself at least), this was much more of a wildcard than we initially assumed. But, the pic, which reportedly cost a modest $40 million to produce, could have legs amongst MacFarlane's devotees in the long run. ""I'm disappointed. I wouldn't tell you otherwise,"" Nikki Rocco, Universal's President, Distribution, told EW. ""We would have hoped it would have been a little bit better, but it's not a grave loss to the studio."" Rounding out the top five are Warner Bros. and Legendary's ""Godzilla"" and ""Blended"" (Warner Bros. as well). The King of the Monsters brought in $12.23 million in its third weekend in theaters, bringing its domestic total to $174.66 million. Finally, in weekend two, Adam Sandler's comedy ""Blended"" managed to beat out Neighbors (now in its fourth weekend in theaters) to take the fifth place spot with $8.43 million. The $40 million pic has made an estimated $29.63 million to date, domestically. Here's the top five: . 1. Maleficent — $70 million (domestic total: $70 million) 2. X-Men: Days of Future Past — $32.6 million (domestic total: $162.1 million) 3. A Million Ways to Die in the West — $17.1 million (domestic total: $17.1 million) 4. Godzilla — $12.23 million (domestic total: $174.66 million) 5. Blended — $8.43 million (domestic total: $29.63 million) UPDATE: In the specialty box office world, Cinedigm's ""Night Moves,"" starring Jesse Eisenberg as a radical environmentalist, made $24K from two locations.

"OXFORD, Mississippi (CNN) -- Unraveling the complex back stories of the more than 200 pardons issued by former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour is revealing serious questions about how pardon review decisions were carried out. But perhaps no pardon is as confounding as the case of Harry Bostick. The retired Internal Revenue Service investigator's pardon has been called ""heinous"" by critics of Barbour. ""Someone didn't do their homework on this case,"" said Democratic state Rep. Steve Holland. When Barbour pardoned Bostick in January, the convicted DUI felon was sitting in an Oxford, Mississippi, jail cell for violating the terms of a previous DUI sentence and was awaiting formal charges from yet another drunken driving accident in October that ended in the tragic death of 18-year-old Charity Smith. Who's at fault in that accident has yet to be determined. The teenage girl from Okolona, Mississippi, had big dreams of saving money and going to college to pursue a business degree. The young woman's death and the controversy surrounding the case have devastated Linda Smith, Charity's mother. ""She should still be here with me. She should still be here with me. This should not have happened,"" Linda Smith told CNN during an emotional two-hour interview. Bostick was given a full pardon for a felony drunken driving offense dating from March 2009. That offense was Bostick's third drunken driving arrest in a little more than year. The Mississippi Parole Board and Barbour have issued statements saying they didn't know Bostick had another DUI arrest in October. It came after his pardon case had already been reviewed. Oxford Police Sgt. Hildon Sessums arrested Bostick twice over a span of a year for DUI. ""Right before I put the cuffs on him he said, 'Don't do this to me.' And my comment to that usually is, you did it to yourself,"" Sessums told CNN as he recounted details of the two arrests. For the third DUI, Bostick had been sentenced in March 2010 to a year of house arrest and four years in Mississippi's drug court program, an intense drug-and-alcohol-abuse treatment program with strict guidelines that convicted felons like Bostick must follow. Bostick was still going through the drug court program when he started applying for a pardon last summer. High-profile friends wrote letters to Barbour touting what they called Bostick's genuine lifestyle change. The letters detail what friends described as Bostick's slide into alcoholism after the tragic death of his teenage son in a ""freakish house fire"" and after Bostick's divorce, according to pardon and parole documents obtained by CNN. One letter said Bostick ""no longer drinks alcohol"" and ""has turned his life around."" ""Harry Bostick has led a tragic life. A life that has now been turned around by a grace that is bigger than him. He can now be a positive factor in many lives,"" wrote retired U.S. attorney Jim Greenlee. On September 30, the Mississippi Parole Board sent its review of the Bostick case to Barbour. The board recommended Bostick for a full pardon with a divided 3-2 vote. About a week later, on October 7, Bostick was driving under the influence again, according to the Mississippi Highway Patrol. Charity Smith attempted to pull out onto a highway just outside Tupelo when Bostick's truck slammed into the side of her car. Charity Smith was killed and her older sister suffered serious injuries. Bostick still has not been indicted by a grand jury in that crash. Because his third DUI was pardoned, a conviction in the latest DUI case would technically be his third offense, but that would still make it a felony in Mississippi. The Mississippi Parole Board and Barbour are at a loss to explain how Bostick's pardon could have unfolded the way it did. State officials say there is not a mechanism in place to alert them of situations like this. A Department of Corrections spokeswoman referred all questions about the case to the Mississippi Parole Board. Bosticks' pardon application packet sent from the Parole Board to the governor's office is filled with references to the ""expedited investigation into the circumstances surrounding Bostick's crime,"" meaning his third DUI from 2009. According to a state prison official, the ""expedited"" rush was a result of a flood of pardon applications as the clock was counting down toward the end of Haley Barbour's final term as governor. Barbour refused CNN's request for an interview but his spokeswoman, Laura Hipp, issued a statement. ""In reviewing Mr. Bostick's case, Gov. Barbour took the Parole Board's recommendation into consideration, and he wasn't aware of the subsequent charges,"" she said. Shannon Warnock, chairwoman of the Mississippi Parole Board, issued a statement saying: ""I can say that Mr. Bostick's application was supported by testimonials from trustworthy and outstanding members of the community. While the reported circumstances of that arrest are troubling, our system of justice does regard everyone as innocent until proved guilty."" Linda Smith, Charity's mother, worries her teenage daughter's death has been forgotten in all of this. She struggles to understand how state officials could not have known that the man involved in her daughter's violent crash was the same Harry Bostick who had petitioned for a pardon. ""She was a person. She wasn't just some name on a piece of paper. A beautiful person,"" said Linda Smith. Her days now are often spent weeping over her daughter's death. She cried throughout most of her interview with CNN as she showed photographs of the beautiful girl with big dreams. Linda Smith described her daughter as an artist with a big heart, and she proudly talked about the powerful emotions she feels holding a collection of her daughter's paintings. One of the paintings was a gift from Charity Smith to her mother. Instead of signing the painting, Charity left her handprint on the back. But perhaps the most poignant painting was of swirling blues and purples and oranges that reads ""Life is Short."" The girl with the artist's heart is now mourned by her mother with a broken heart.","Harry Bostick is a repeat DUI offender .

"(CNN) -- An Idaho man has been charged with assaulting a minor after he allegedly uttered a racial slur and slapped a 2-year-old boy who cried on a Delta plane as it began the final descent into Atlanta, court papers show. Reached by phone Friday, Joe Rickey Hundley of Hayden, Idaho, declined to comment to CNN and referred inquiries to his attorney. The attorney couldn't be immediately reached for comment Friday. Delta Air Lines is cooperating with the federal investigation into the altercation between two passengers, spokesman Paul Skrbec said. ""We apologize for any inconvenience this caused for the passengers onboard,"" he said. Air rage: Passengers 'quicker to snap' The boy's mother, Jessica Bennett, 33, of Minnesota told the FBI that she and her son were seated in row 28, seat B, on February 8 on Delta Flight 721 that originated in Minneapolis, according to an FBI agent's affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta this week. The boy began crying because of the altitude change, and his mother tried to soothe him, court papers said. Then Hundley, who was seated next to the mother and son, allegedly told her to ""shut that ('N word') baby up,"" according to court documents. Hundley then turned around and slapped the 2-year-old in the face with an open hand, which caused the child to scream even louder, the affidavit said. The boy suffered a scratch below his right eye, court papers said. Other passengers on the plane assisted Bennett, and one of them heard the slur and witnessed the alleged assault, the affidavit said. The plane landed at Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson International. The charge of simple assault on someone under age 16 carries a prison sentence of one year, court papers said. Hundley has since been suspended from his job pending the investigation. ""We understand that authorities are investigating the recent behavior of one of our business unit executives while on personal travel. The allegations are disturbing and are contradictory to our values,"" said Al Haase, president and CEO of AGC Aerospace & Defense, Composites Group.

"(CNN) -- On Monday, a federal court struck down Alabama's medically unnecessary law that singles out doctors who provide abortions and requires them to secure admitting privileges at a local hospital. The court called the justification for the law ""exceedingly weak."" As an obstetrician-gynecologist, I couldn't agree more. This decision is an important win for American women and for the practice of medicine. Let me be clear: We all want women to receive safe medical care. But these laws (a number of states have adopted them) do not make women safer. In fact, they have quite the opposite effect, as they will make it harder for women to access medical care, potentially forcing them to seek abortion services later in their pregnancy. These laws also jeopardize women's safety by forcing qualified physicians to stop providing abortions for reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with medical safety. That is why leading medical groups like the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association oppose them. Whether a physician who provides abortions has hospital admitting privileges is not a reflection on the physician's ability to provide quality abortion care. While hospital privileges in theory should be awarded based on physician competency, they in fact are often denied for reasons unrelated to the physician's medical qualifications. For example, to obtain privileges, hospitals often require physicians to admit a certain number of patients each year. But doctors who provide abortions will likely never admit the minimum number of patients because complications are very, very rare. Here's what is important to remember: Abortion is already extremely safe, and for the vast majority of abortions, hospitals do not need to play a role in the patient's care. Abortion has a more than 99% safety record, with a less than 0.3% risk of complications that could merit hospital treatment. More than 90% of abortions in the United States are performed in outpatient settings and almost all the complications that do arise can be treated on an outpatient basis. It's one of the safest medical procedures performed in the United States today, period. In the exceedingly rare event of a complication, women's health centers have procedures in place to ensure that a woman gets the care she needs. Admitting privileges -- or lack thereof -- don't have any effect on a woman's ability to receive emergency care if she needs it. In our modern care delivery model, emergency room physicians, hospitalists and hospital staff are trained to identify and treat all these types of patient situations. Even procedures with much higher rates of complication and mortality, such as colonoscopy, are not subject to these burdensome requirements because it's clear that they are not needed to keep patients safe. These baseless restrictions serve solely to prevent qualified, competent physicians from providing safe abortion care to women who need it. To put it simply, there is no medical reason to treat abortion providers any differently than other medical professionals. As the Alabama court found, the law would have forced all but two health centers in the entire state to stop providing abortions. A similar law in Mississippi would force the last remaining clinic in the state to shut its doors, leaving women in the state with no place to safely end a pregnancy. Similar requirements have devastated women and families in Texas and threaten to close clinics in Oklahoma, Louisiana and Wisconsin. These laws are clearly not motivated by women's safety, but by making access to safe, legal abortion difficult -- even impossible. Monday's court opinion recognizes that a woman is safest when she can make the decision about abortion with her family in consultation with her doctor, free from political interference. It clears one obstacle in the path of women -- and their doctors -- in Alabama. In states across the nation, legislators who truly care about women's safety would do well to work to eliminate unfounded restrictions to abortion, instead of continuing to introduce them.","John Jennings: Court strikes down Alabama law that erects barriers for abortion doctors .

"(CNN) -- A call to the Secret Witness tip line helped police break CNN's first featured cold case: the slaying of college student Brianna Denison, investigators say. James Michael Biela, 27, is accused of killing 19-year-old Brianna Denison. A construction worker was charged with Denison's murder last week, nearly 10 months after the 19-year-old California college student was found strangled and sexually assaulted in Reno, Nevada. At a news conference Wednesday, relief was visible on the faces of the cops who worked the case and came, as one said, to view Denison as ""everyone's daughter."" For her family, the relief competed with tears. The arrest of James Michael Biela, 27, closes one chapter and opens another as the case moves from the investigative phase and into the courts.  Watch what led to the arrest » . For Nancy Grace's Cold Case team, the arrest also marks a milestone. Brianna Denison's was the first cold case we featured. Her story appeared on CNN.com, and a segment aired on ""Nancy Grace"" on September 15. And now, it is also our first cracked cold case. Denison, who attended Santa Barbara Community College, vanished January 20 while visiting friends at the University of Nevada's Reno campus. Her body was found several days later, partially covered with snow in a desolate field outside of town. Biela, a former Marine, is charged with murdering Denison by strangulation. Prosecutors say they may file more charges as the case makes its way through the courts. Biela also was charged with first-degree kidnapping and sexual assault of a second young woman, a student at the University of Nevada, Reno. And, police say, Biela is a suspect in the November 2007 parking lot assault of another UNR student. In that case, the alleged victim washed off evidence of the crime and delayed reporting the attack, police said at the news conference. DNA is the crucial link in the two cases that led to criminal charges. Police say they were able to connect Biela's DNA with a sample left on panties found near Denison's body. Police said at the news conference that they found DNA matching Biela's on the rear door of  the off-campus house where Denison was staying with friends.  Watch how the investigation unfolded » . It also matched DNA found at the scene of a December 16 sexual assault, police maintain. The victim, a UNR student,  was able to escape her attacker and describe him in detail, police say. Both crimes bear a striking resemblance to several other sexual assaults in the area, leading police to believe that Biela is a serial rapist. They are asking other possible victims to come forward. One of the previous victims was able to describe Biela's pickup, another key link in the evidentiary chain, according to investigators. Police say Biela's associates told them he left Reno in a hurry in March, shortly after Denison's body was found. He also sold the pickup that matched the witness' description. The investigation has now turned up gray fibers on one victim's clothing, said Detective Adam Wygnanski of the Reno Police Department. They appear to match fibers from the gray velour interior the pickup Biela sold, he added. Biela returned to Reno in September. It was an anonymous tip from a friend of his former girlfriend November 1 that broke this cold case wide open, police say. Investigators had established that the killer was from the Reno area and had an unusual fetish of collecting one victim's underwear and leaving it as a ""calling card"" at the next victim's crime scene. The tipster caught investigators' attention, telling the Secret Witness tip line about Biela's pickup and suspicious ex-girlfriend. The tipster then told police that the former girlfriend had found two pairs of thong panties in Biela's new truck. Detectives immediately followed up on the tip and, with permission from the former girlfriend, took DNA samples from Biela's 4-year-old son. Lab tests showed that the boy's father -- Biela -- was almost certainly a match for the DNA found on the doorknob and at the crime scene, police said. The finding was confirmed when Biela was arrested and ordered to submit DNA samples. An overnight session at the crime lab confirmed the match, and charges were filed, police said. Investigators say they since have learned that Biela was familiar with the grounds of the university, having worked there on a construction job last year. Police say his work on campus put him in a position to easily target women. When first questioned about the Denison case in early November, Biela refused to submit DNA samples and provided an alibi to police, claiming that he'd been with his girlfriend. The girlfriend denies that he was with her the night Denison disappeared, investigators say. Police spokesman Lt. Robert McDonald said investigators have no doubt that Biela is responsible for Denison's death. ""We knew the profile we were looking for: someone unobtrusive, who stalked his victims quietly but escalated his violence with each new attack,"" he said. Now, it's up to the courts to decide. Meanwhile, investigators are certain there are other victims who just haven't come forward. Police are urging anyone with more information to call the Reno Police Hot Line at 775-745-3521.","James Michael Biela, 27, is charged with murder of Brianna Denison .

"(CNN) -- A Sudanese court sentenced a pregnant 27 year old woman, called Meriam Yehya Ibrahim, to death this week. Her crime was she fell in love and married a Christian man and affirmed her faith in Christianity. She was subsequently accused, and convicted, of apostasy, since the court in Khartoum regards her as a Muslim even though she was raised Christian by her mother after her Muslim father left when she was six years old. Since the court does not recognise her marriage to a non-Muslim either, she has also been convicted of adultery and sentenced to 100 lashes. As disturbing as the above story may be, unfortunately it does not come as a surprise. Countries such as Sudan, Pakistan and more recently Brunei are increasingly lurching towards archaic and inane interpretations of Sharia and applying laws that undermine basic human rights and equality. This not only puts them at odds with the modern world, it puts them at odds with the trajectory progressive Muslim thinkers and reformists have been travelling in for the last 200 years. The idea that Muslims who leave Islam should be killed is prominent in medieval jurisprudential texts that were written at a time when religious faith and political allegiance were inextricably linked. Hence, leaving the faith was deemed treason and construed as an act of rebellion against political authorities. As Muslim political empires became more diverse, conceptions of political allegiance began to change and in 1844, the Ottoman Empire abolished the death penalty for apostasy from Islam. Al-Azhar in Egypt, the world's most influential Sunni religious authority, followed suit in 1958 and issued a formal fatwa (religious edict) abolishing the death penalty for apostasy. Apostasy laws also blatantly contradict the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UGHR) which was introduced in 1948 and signed by most Muslim-majority countries at the time. However, the so-called ""Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam,"" issued by Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) Foreign Ministers in 1990, contains the following clauses: . ""Article 10: Islam is the religion of unspoiled nature. It is prohibited to exercise any form of compulsion on man or to exploit his poverty or ignorance in order to convert him to another religion or to atheism."" ""Article 22(a): Everyone shall have the right to express his opinion freely in such manner as would not be contrary to the principles of the Shar'iah."" ""Article 25: The Islamic Shari'ah is the only source of reference for the explanation or clarification to any of the articles of this Declaration."" The last two articles of this bizarre and highly-politicized declaration, allow Muslim-majority countries to violate the UDHR by invoking the Sharia as though there was a unified version of it. Not only is there no single interpretation of Sharia, but certain Muslim-majority countries seem adamant on re-invigorating some of the most regressive and outmoded interpretations of it in an almost defiant and aggressive manner. This lurch towards medievalism is largely driven by the global Islamist movement, which was born in 1928 when the Muslim Brotherhood was established, and gained real momentum after the Iranian revolution in 1979. The current regime in Sudan, which seized power after a military coup in 1989, has systematically used Islamism to silence domestic dissent. They have even reached out to Islamist militant groups in the region and hosted the late al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, in the early 1990s. The global Islamist movement seeks a much greater role for Islam in the political sphere and, in its political stances, is defined by its opposition to the West. In synchronizing a medieval interpretation of Islam with politics, this movement seeks to challenge and reverse progress on human rights and equality that has been made in recent decades. Hence, we are witnessing the introduction of increasingly antiquated laws that discriminate and undermine basic rights. It is time for the Cairo Declaration to be revoked and for the Muslim human rights discourse to catch up with, and contribute as an equal partner to, modern international human rights discourse. It is also time for human rights groups and the international community to take a strong stance against any state that violates the rights of ordinary citizens for making choices the rest of us take for granted.","A Sudanese court sentenced a pregnant 27 year old woman to death this week .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Former lighting technician Patrick McDermott, best known as Olivia Newton-John's boyfriend of nine years, mysteriously disappeared July 1, 2005. Olivia Newton-John and Patrick McDermott were together for nine years. Then he disappeared. He wasn't on board the fishing boat ""Freedom"" when it returned to shore in San Pedro, California, after an overnight excursion. Investigators say he'd visited Newton-John the day before with flowers, bid her farewell and ended their relationship. McDermott was seen boarding the vessel that evening with his fishing gear and a duffle bag. The 22 passengers and three crew members on board gave conflicting reports about his whereabouts both during and at the end of the trip. Police have determined that McDermott did indeed board the vessel, fished with the others and socialized on the boat both on June 30 and the next day, July 1. However, the witness accounts conflict about what happened as the boat neared shore on the afternoon of July 1. No one is quite sure when they last saw McDermott in the last 30 minutes of the voyage.  Watch why this cold case is a real mystery » . McDermott paid his bar and kitchen tab, which consisted of two hot dogs and a Coke, a kitchen receipt shows. Then he seems to have vanished. Some witnesses told police they thought they saw McDermott get off the boat when it docked and walk toward the parking lot, but they cannot be sure it was him. Ten days passed before relatives began a search for McDermott. They first became alarmed on July 6 when he didn't show up for a family gathering. Relatives found his car still parked at the San Pedro Marina where he'd left it when he boarded the fishing vessel. Investigators then discovered McDermott had left personal items on the boat, including his wallet. As police looked into his background, they learned that McDermott had been facing a mountain of debt, including being ordered by a court to pay back child support payments for his 15-year-old son from a prior marriage. A Coast Guard investigation concluded that he was ""most likely drowned at sea."" But some people believe he may be alive. Investigators have theorized that McDermott may have staged his death to escape financial pressures. Since McDermott disappeared, there have been hundreds of supposed sightings of him in Mexico. Private investigators and some police investigators speculate that McDermott may be hiding in the small village of Sayulita, 40 miles outside the resort town of Puerta Vallarta. A community of expatriates in Sayulita work as deckhands for the mega-yachts owned by billionaire South American businessmen. The Coast Guard, the lead investigative agency, says its case is closed. It found no evidence to support or disprove criminality or foul play in the McDermott disappearance. ""We spoke to dozens of witnesses on that vessel and we concluded any reported sightings of McDermott getting off that boat after it docked were not credible,"" said Scott Epperson, a Coast Guard spokesman in Long Beach. Although the investigation is officially closed, he encourages anyone with credible tips to please call the tip line at 310-521-4296. McDermott was 48 years old at the time of his disappearance three years ago. He is 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 140 pounds, with brown eyes and salt-and-pepper hair.","Patrick McDermott broke up with Olivia Newton-John the day before he vanished .

"(CNN) -- The town of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, is tiny. The population barely reaches 7,000, and the smattering of tourists it attracts throughout the year are undoubtedly lured by its rustic, small-town charm. Its handful of attractions include some vintage hot spring resorts (pre-World War II, the town was a hotspot for wellness tourism), some nearby ghost towns and roaming buffalo. ""Here, you're in the middle of what I consider to be the real West,"" says John Mulcahy, mayor of Truth or Consequences (or T or C, as it's known locally). ""It's a back-to-nature kind of place. I love to take my four-wheel drive and head out into the wilderness, where there are 100-mile vistas. There's nothing like it in the continuous United States."" Not surprisingly, T or C lacks the name recognition of, say, Santa Fe or Albuquerque. That is set to change in the next couple of years however, as the town is on the brink of becoming the epicenter for space tourism. Spaceport America -- which next year is slated to send a troupe of multi-millionaires up into the stratosphere when Virgin Galactic moves in -- is a mere 30 miles to the northeast. ""Spaceport America employs 1,300 people across New Mexico, and we're looking to add another 1,800 jobs by 2018,"" says Christine Anderson, executive director of Spaceport America and the New Mexico Spaceport Authority. With an additional 200,000 yearly visitors projected once Virgin moves in -- and the Spaceport completes its Welcome Center (which Anderson estimates will take another 16 months to finish) -- T or C is likely to experience a serious uptick. In fact, experts estimate the population is likely to double. Quiz: Do you have what it takes to be a space tourist? ""The number that I've seen that scares me the most is 3,000 people in our downtown on a Saturday,"" admits Mulcahy. Currently, the potential of space tourism has everyone in the area on high alert. Virgin are meeting with local tourism suppliers next month to help ready them for the supposed onslaught, while T or C has embarked on a mission to spruce up ahead of its visitors. ""We're working hard to make the town more attractive, but at the same time, we don't want it to lose its character. We don't want a 5-star hotel in downtown,"" he says. Still, it's difficult to imagine Richard Branson's clients, many of whom have paid $250,000 for their ticket to space, feeling content staying at the local budget hotel. ""I would say there's plenty of hotels to handle the initial amount of space tourists, but I don't think there is anything (in the luxury market),"" says Dr. Alison Green, an assistant professor at the William F. Harrah College of Hotel Administration in Las Vegas, Nevada. Read more: What does a Virgin Galactic ticket buy you? While some have called on the luxury hospitality industry to anticipate the needs of the projected high-fliers, it seems many brands are slow to answer. In April, CNN founder Ted Turner bought T or C's Sierra Grande Lodge and Spa -- one of the few upscale accommodations in the region -- but other investors seem to be playing wait-and-see. ""We are lagging in terms of business investment,"" admits Mulcahy, though he maintains he's not worried about the future of T or C. ""This is the most amazing, iconic facility in the world, but it's like anything else: you have to see it to believe it, and that's true of investment. Investment follows opportunity, it doesn't really lead opportunity."" Monique Jacobson, the New Mexico state tourism secretary , says that developers have been scoping out the area ever since the Spaceport was first proposed. The challenge, she says, won't be luring investors, so much as ensuring the region keeps its charms. ""If there are luxury resorts, they still need to be true to what makes New Mexico so unique, because that's what's going to keep it a special experience for the people that visit,"" she says.","Spaceport America expects 200,000 yearly visitors once Virgin moves in .

"(CNN) -- Prosecutor Gerrie Nel went on the attack again Thursday, trying to discredit a defense witness for Oscar Pistorius on the last day of testimony before the court takes a two-and-a-half week break. Forensics expert Roger Dixon, on the stand for a third day, was grilled over his interpretation of a reconstruction of the scene where double-amputee runner Pistorius killed girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in February last year. One key line of questioning dealt with the position of a magazine rack within the toilet room where she was shot. Under pressure from Nel, Dixon directly contradicted Pistorius' version of where he saw the magazine rack when he entered the toilet room after shooting Steenkamp. In his own testimony, Pistorius said that when Steenkamp was slumped over the toilet bowl, she wasn't on top of the magazine rack. He said it was off to the side. Nel then showed him a photo of the toilet with the magazine rack standing in a pool of blood -- and Pistorius said it must have been placed there. Dixon directly contradicted this in his testimony Thursday, saying the rack was moved after it was in the pool of blood. The question is important in part because Pistorius contends that police contaminated the crime scene by moving certain key items, including the magazine rack. Pistorius also told the court he opened fire after hearing the sound of movement within the toilet room, which made him believe the door was opening. In retrospect, he concluded that what he heard was the magazine rack moving. In his questioning Thursday, Nel also tried to cast doubt on Dixon's analysis of a mark on the toilet door that the expert says was made by Pistorius kicking it with his prosthesis, and about the expert's ballistics reconstruction. Bullet ricochet . Nel's aim in the murder trial is to prove that Pistorius intentionally shot and killed Steenkamp after a heated argument in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year. The defense team is seeking to cast doubt on that account and prove that the star sprinter shot his girlfriend through the closed toilet door after mistaking her for an intruder. In his testimony Wednesday, Dixon disputed a conclusion by a pathologist on the cause of Steenkamp's back wounds. The pathologist said they were made by a bullet ricochet, while Dixon said they were made by the magazine rack. The autopsy said they were made by a blunt, hard object. Following Dixon's testimony, the court in Pretoria, South Africa, was adjourned until May 5. When the court reconvenes, the next defense witness will be Johan Stander, manager of the Silver Woods Estate where Pistorius lived and the first person the athlete called after he shot Steenkamp. Gripping trial . The trial is scheduled to continue until the middle of May. Judge Thokozile Masipa will decide the verdict in collaboration with two experts called assessors. South Africa does not have jury trials. If Pistorius is found guilty of premeditated murder, he faces 25 years to life in prison. The trial has gripped South Africa and sports fans worldwide who considered Pistorius a symbol of triumph over physical adversity. His disabled lower legs were amputated when he was a baby, but he went on to achieve global fame as the ""Blade Runner,"" winning numerous Paralympic gold medals on the carbon-fiber blades fitted to his prostheses. He also competed against able-bodied runners at the Olympics. Only those in the courtroom saw Pistorius on the stand, because he chose not to testify on camera.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Cleashindra Hall was 18 and in the most exciting time of her life when she disappeared in May 1994, a week after her senior prom. Cleashindra Hall was two weeks shy of her high school graduation when she disappeared. She had spent hours preparing for the prom, choosing the perfect dress and getting her hair and nails done. She was an honor roll student and would give the commencement speech at her high school graduation in two weeks. Hall wanted to be a pediatrician and was looking forward to attending Tennessee State University to study pre-medicine. But all that came to an abrupt halt after 8:30 p.m. May 9, 1994, when she left her after-school job at the home office of Dr. Larry Amos in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. It was the last time she was seen. She usually called home when finished work, and one of her parents would pick her up. She spoke to her mother on the phone just after 8 p.m. Her mother expected her to call again soon for a ride home. She never did.  Watch how phone calls play a role in this case » . Laurell Hall fell asleep waiting for her daughter's call. She awoke abruptly at 1 a.m., realizing that her daughter had not called and had not come home. Amos, Hall's employer, told police she had left his house at 8: 30 p.m., getting into a car with someone he assumed was giving her a ride. The next day, Hall's parents reported her missing. ""It's been very frustrating for us. We feel that police didn't do everything they could have done at the beginning, when she first went missing,"" Laurell Hall said. ""We had to wait 24 hours in those days before police would take a missing persons report."" It disturbs Laurell Hall that the home where her daughter was last seen was not searched for nearly two weeks after her daughter vanished. ""I don't understand why police could not search the home immediately to make sure there was no sign of a struggle there,"" Hall said. ""Maybe they would have found her press-on nails or hair extensions there; who knows?"" Amos did not return CNN's phone call seeking comment. Police say the house was full of people the night Hall was working there. Lt. Terry Hopson of the Pine Bluff Police Department said a search of the Amos home did not turn up any evidence that Hall was injured or attacked there. ""We do believe she left that house that night with someone she was acquainted with,"" Hopson said. He did not elaborate. ""We have spent many hours and manpower on this case over the years and continue to diligently investigate this case and developing leads,"" Hopson said. He hinted that police have some idea of what happened to Hall that night but are seeking forensic evidence to support their theory. Police said they obtained phone records from the Amos home for the hours when Hall was working there. But they won't say who, if anyone, may have spoken with Hall on the phone besides her mother. Both family and police say Hall was not the type to go somewhere without telling anyone. She also had no reason to escape her life and was not a troubled teen. Police consider the disappearance to be suspicious and believe that foul play is involved. However, they have no clues as to who might have abducted her. There is no description of the vehicle that may have picked Hall up from the Amos home, though police believe that if she got into a car with someone, it would have been someone she knew. According to family and friends, Hall did not have a boyfriend. Police did question and administer a polygraph to a boy in the community who Hall liked and was friendly with. The polygraph results are unclear, and police interrogation of the boy and their search of his vehicle did not provide any leads. When Hall disappeared in 1994, cell phone triangulation and other technologies commonly used in missing person cases today weren't available. Police say they have no forensic evidence in this case. Their only hope is that someone comes forward with a tip after all these years. Cleashindra Hall is black, stands 5'8"" tall, weighs 120 pounds and has dark short hair, dark eyes and a surgical scar on her left knee. She was last seen with her hair in a ponytail, wearing a white shirt and short set with navy polka dots and stripes, white socks and small stud earrings. Police urge anyone with more information regarding the whereabouts of Cleashindra Hall to call the tip line at 870-543-5111. More than $10,000 in reward money is offered.","Cleashindra Hall hoped to be a pediatrician .

"(CNN) -- Shezanne Cassim, an American who was jailed in the United Arab Emirates after posting a video that parodied Dubai teens, returned to the United States on Thursday and sharply criticized the authorities who imprisoned him. ""I did nothing wrong,"" Cassim said in Minneapolis. ""There was nothing illegal about the video, even under UAE law. I was tried in a textbook kangaroo court, and I was convicted without any evidence."" For months, Cassim said, he and others apprehended in the case didn't know why they were behind bars. ""We had no idea of what our crime was. We had no idea how long we'd be in prison for. We weren't actually told what our crime was until five months later, after we were taken in,"" he said. ""Even then, we heard rumors of the charges, and they kept on changing."" In December, Cassim was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of about $2,700. The charges were not read in court, but the country's main English-language newspaper reported that Cassim was accused of defaming the UAE's image abroad. UAE officials would say only that Cassim ""was charged under the UAE's penal code"" and was ""entitled to the fair trial protections contained in the UAE's constitution."" Cassim said the reason behind his detention was clear. ""Due to the political situation there, they're scared of democracy. They wanted to send a message to the UAE public, saying, 'Look what we'll do to people who do just a silly YouTube video, so imagine if you do something that's actually critical of the government.' It's a warning message, and we're scapegoats,"" he said. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Tuesday that after getting credit against his one-year sentence for time served and ""for good behavior,"" Cassim was moved to a deportation facility for processing. According to his family, Cassim, of Woodbury, Minnesota, ended up serving nine months in prison -- more than half of those before being charged -- before his recent move to a deportation facility. He had moved to Dubai in 2006, after graduating from college, to work for PricewaterhouseCoopers. His family says the 29-year-old was arrested in April after uploading a 19-minute video that pokes fun at a clique of Dubai teens influenced by hip-hop culture. In the 1990s, the label ""Satwa G"" was given to a group of suburban teens who were known to talk tougher than they really were. Cassim's video depicts a ""combat school"" in the Dubai district of Satwa, where these ""gangsters"" are trained. The training includes how to throw sandals at targets, use clothing accessories as whips and call on the phone for backup. Shervon Cassim said his brother made the video ""just for fun.""","NEW: Shezanne Cassim has returned to the United States .

"(Mashable) -- Facebook on Thursday introduced a program that, in effect, offers consumers a financial incentive to watch ads on the site. Facebook will now reward users who watch certain ads on the site with Facebook Credits, which can be redeemed to purchase goods on Facebook Deals, the company's new Groupon-like daily deals service. The incentive, however, is not huge. Initially at least, the average ad will yield one credit, which is the equivalent of 10 cents. The ads will mostly be in games. CrowdStar, Digital Chocolate and Zynga are among the participating game publishers. Facebook is working with Sharethrough, SocialVibe, Epic Media and SupersonicAds to serve ads on the program as well as TrialPay, which will provide analytics. Dan Greenberg, CEO of Sharethrough, says that Facebook's move represents ""a step away from interruptive advertising."" Greenberg, whose clients include Microsoft and Nestle, says his network won't deliver traditional advertising, but rather branded entertainment, which consumers will want to not only watch, but share with their friends. Incentivizing consumers to watch ads is one solution for Facebook's low banner click-through rates. The move comes after Facebook expanded its Credits program last week to let consumers use the Credits to buy real-world goods advertised in Deals. Previously, the credits, which were awarded for consumers who signed up for various programs (like magazine subscriptions) or bought outright could only buy virtual goods.

"(CNN) -- Gay basketball star John Amaechi has criticized the head of soccer's ruling body for his comments about homosexuals planning to attend the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. FIFA president Sepp Blatter was unable to keep a straight face when asked at a press conference in South Africa what to advise gay people who hope to go to the Arab emirate. The mainly Muslim country, which will host the tournament for the first time, forbids same-sex relationships by law. ""I would say that they should refrain from sexual activities,"" Blatter answered on Monday, after a long pause. ""We are living in a world of freedom and when the World Cup will be in Qatar, this will be in 2022. And you can see in the Middle East the opening of this culture. It is another culture because it is another religion, but in football we have no boundaries."" However, Amaechi -- who became the first NBA basketballer to reveal he is gay after retiring in 2007 -- accused the 74-year-old Blatter of showing ""archaic, Neanderthal ignorance"" towards the world's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. Blog: Has FIFA gambled with World Cup decisions? ""The statements and the position adopted by Sepp Blatter and FIFA regarding LGBT fans who would pay the enormous ticket and travel prices to attend the World Cup in 2022 should have been wholly unacceptable a decade ago,"" the U.S.-born British citizen wrote on his website. ""Instead, with little more than an afterthought, FIFA has endorsed the marginalization of LGBT people around the world. If sport cannot serve to change society, even temporarily during the duration of an event like the World Cup, then it is little more than grown men chasing a ball and we should treat it as such."" Amaechi said Blatter's comments were more damaging than they may have appeared at face value. ""Blatter's words aren't really about sex, as I can't imagine that many gay football fans would be bold enough to do it in public in Qatar. Rather, what he is really saying is 'Don't be camp, don't hold hands, don't look into each other's eyes, don't book rooms with one bed, don't have candle-lit dinners in the restaurant...' and on and on,"" he said. ""He's really saying don't even 'look' gay, re-closet yourself and pretend the ties and love and affection you have for your partner or even some random bloke you might meet on your travels are gone for the whole time you are in Qatar."" Qatar: From obscure desert kingdom to World Cup host . However, Blatter insisted that gay people would have no such problems in Qatar in 2022. ""I think there shall not be any discrimination against any human beings on this side or that side -- or left or right or whatever,"" he told reporters. ""And we don't want to have any discrimination. So you can be assured that ... if people want to watch a match in 2022 I am sure they will be admitted to such matches. ""What we want to do is open this game to all people to all cultures, and this is what we are doing in 2022."" World Cup nets $509 million for South Africa . Blatter was in South Africa to launch a legacy trust of $100 million to be distributed in the country after it became the first on the continent to host a World Cup earlier this year. Of that, $80 million will go to social community projects while the rest was given to the South African Football Association in the build-up to the tournament. ""When I arrived back in South Africa, I saw excited people shouting, 'Welcome back, welcome back'. This to me shows that the spirit of the World Cup is still alive in this country,"" Blatter said. ""Now we go to the East of Europe to Russia where the World Cup has never been. Later on, we go to the Middle East. The World Cup must go to where it can improve social conditions and make a difference. ""From the South African tourism minister, we learned that over 300,000 people came to South Africa for the World Cup. This, in turn, has been a major boost for the South African economy.""","FIFA president advises gay soccer fans traveling to Qatar to refrain from sexual activities .

"(CNN) -- Like many other Yemenis, I was overwhelmed by the news of the Life March which was set off from Freedom Square in Taiz late December 2011. Thousands of youths walked for almost five days, covering more than 250 kilometers by foot. The youth used the term Life March to denote a continuation of their revolutionary protest and a rejection of the immunity given to President Ali Abdullah Saleh. They wanted the whole international community to notice that what is happening in Yemen is in fact a revolution, not just a political crisis. In this spirit, they wanted the world to seriously consider their demands to topple Saleh's regime completely and start building the civil and democratic country they all aspire to have. When the youth started their march, they knew that it might involve many risks and dangers that may have threatened their lives. It was not unrealistic that thugs and snipers loyal to Saleh could inflict heavy casualties on the marchers. However, the marchers slowly shed these concerns as they climbed the mountainous roads along the cities of Ibb and Dhamar on their way to Sana'a. Their march surprisingly grew in size as youth from cities joined in. However, they were received at the entrance of the capital of Sana'a and some of its streets with a fierce attack by Saleh's loyalists and thugs. Early reports stated that at least 13 protesters died and dozens more were injured as troops opened fire on the Gandhi-style mass peaceful protest. That was the way Saleh and his associates decided to show their hospitality to the exhausted and fatigued marchers. Yet the revolutionary youth of Change Square in Sana'a rushed to defend them against Saleh's forces and to lead them to the square which was set as their final destination. That was where they gave them a warm welcome and later celebrated them as heroes of the nation. As the marchers overcame the risks and troubles they faced, the march's meaning evolved and came to represent a new turn in the course of Yemen's revolution. From one perspective, the march revealed the true depth to which the Arab youth have contributed to the success of the revolutionary protests. What surprised the world the most about the Arab Spring was not the unpredictability of events, but the level of civility utilized to achieve success. The Life March is just one example of the youth's determination to shape the arc of Yemen's future without guns, violence or bloodshed. Yemen is experiencing two revolutions, says female activist . Despite the bravery shown by the marchers, and their commitment to non-violence, the media has largely remained silent on the first march from one city to another. The media simply circumvented the march by tabbing it is a ""peaceful rally"" falling drastically short of what it really was. It is difficult to understand why the event did not receive the coverage it deserved. The march broke the typical cliches of Yemen as a country of bombs and terrorists and, if covered, could have shown the whole world that Yemen is an army of liberation -- demonstrating hope for all those who seek freedom but lack the means to achieve it. The march was a symbol for the historical new trajectory of the Arab world. The area is witnessing a birth of a new generation that has broken the shackles of oppression and submission. By realizing the universal rights of a life of dignity and freedom of choice, this new generation is eager to shape its future and build a country of its own volition. The autocracy of oppression that has permeated the Arab world will never find its way into the history of the Arabs as long as youth exist. How Arab youth found their voice . Youth have sacrificed their lives for the success of the revolution, and now should not be the time to undermine them and the role they will play in shaping Yemen's future. Youth have always been at the heart of the uprisings: they were the first out on the streets to demonstrate, the least likely to be intimidated, most likely to raise their voice against authorities. They have received enough criticism. It is now time to join them in their marches and celebrate them as the heroes our country needs. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Murad Alazzany.","Thousands of young people took part in inspirational march over 250 km in five days .

"(CNN) -- A 17-year-old Connecticut high school student pleaded not guilty Wednesday in the slashing death of a classmate in a school stairwell in April, a court official said. Christopher Plaskon appeared in Milford Superior Court, where he waived his right to a probable cause hearing and elected to be tried by a three-judge panel rather than a 12-member jury, according to clerk Linda Kautzner. His attorney, Richard Meehan Jr., told CNN that he is considering a mental health defense. Plaskon is suspected of slashing classmate Maren Sanchez, 16, at Jonathan Law High School in Milford on April 25. He was 16 at the time. A witness saw Plaskon on top of the victim and tried unsuccessfully to pull him away, according to a probable cause statement in the case. Another witness allegedly saw him discarding a bloody knife in a school corridor. The state medical examiner's office concluded that Sanchez died from ""stab wounds to the trunk and neck"" and ruled the death a homicide. Though the motive remains under investigation, police were looking into whether the boy was angry after Sanchez rejected him as a prom date. ""I did it,"" Plaskon allegedly told a school police officer in the principal's office moments after the crime, according to the probable cause statement. ""Just arrest me."" Plaskon was ordered held on $3 million bond in April. He was charged as an adult and faces 25 to 60 years in prison if convicted.

"(CNN) -- Almost a year to the day after learning he had the deadliest form of brain cancer, Steve Holl was dancing at his daughter Eryn's wedding. ""To have my dad there was just one of those moments where you really want to stop time,"" Eryn Holl says. ""You want to look at him and hold on tight."" Fewer than one in three patients with Holl's type of cancer, a glioblastoma, have traditionally survived a year, let alone been well enough to dance. But Holl, 61, has something going for him beyond radiation and chemotherapy -- a custom-made vaccine. Holl (pronounced Hall) received the vaccine as part of a clinical trial at the University of California San Francisco. ""The approach that we take is we actually do the surgery. We take the tumor out, and then we make the vaccine directly from that individual patient's tumor. And then give that vaccine back to the patient,"" says Dr. Andrew Parsa, who heads the trial. Glioblastomas have been particularly deadly because no matter how skilled, neurosurgeons cannot remove the entire tumor. Some cancer cells remain hidden in the brain and eventually grow back -- usually within months. It's in the family of brain cancers that claimed the life of Sen. Ted Kennedy. So far, Parsa's ongoing clinical trial is beating those odds. More than a year into the trial, none of the eight patients who have received vaccines made from their tumors has seen cancer return. ""It's really, really encouraging,"" Parsa says, adding that it's too early to draw any big conclusions. The vaccines are designed to alert the body to cells that don't belong and trigger the body's immune system to attack multiple points on the cancer cells. How many vaccine doses patients receive depend on how much of the tumor surgeons are able to remove. Holl had the first of 14 vaccine doses in February. Using a vaccine to fight cancer makes sense to Holl, a biologist who lives in Folsom, California. ""Smallpox works, polio works,"" says Holl. ""You're allowing your own body to combat the cancer, which is an irregularity anyway."" Parsa envisions someday treating glioblastomas as a chronic disease, rather than a death sentence. ""I don't think that it's appropriate to use the word cure with glioblastoma. We really want to turn this into a chronic disease like hypertension or diabetes that allows you to take medicine to live a normal life,"" he says. Parsa's research is being funded by a combination of federal grants and donations from advocacy groups such as the National Brain Tumor Society. ""This trial would not have happened without the support of patient advocacy groups,"" Parsa says. In addition to UCSF, Columbia University and Case Western Reserve University are also testing the vaccine, and the clinical trial may expand to more hospitals. In the past month, Holl has walked Eryn down the aisle and celebrated his 36th wedding anniversary. He is upbeat about the future. ""I'm really hopeful that the vaccine works and I can get another 20 years of life,"" Holl says.","Clinical trial to treat glioblastomas tests vaccines made from patients' own tumors .

"Lawrenceville, Georgia (CNN) -- You might recognize prominent primatologist Frans de Waal from lectures he has given about his research on primate behavior, which have been popularized on YouTube. His face is familiar to chimpanzees, too; some chimps that he knew as babies still recognize him even after decades apart, he said. ""Chimpanzees have the advantage that you cannot ask them questions, so you have to watch (their) behavior to see what they do,"" says de Waal, director of Emory University's Living Links Center, in his Dutch-accented voice that is both gentle and authoritative. He adds, with dry humor: ""With humans, you can ask questions and you get all sorts of answers I don't trust, so I prefer to work with chimpanzees for that reason."" Living Links is part of the oldest and largest primate center in the United States: The Yerkes National Primate Research Center, a secluded grassy area in suburban Atlanta where humans work in office trailers and other animals play in open-air compounds. De Waal, who has been at the center for more than 20 years, has made a career out of finding links between primate and human behavior, particularly in the areas of morality and empathy. You might think of ""morality"" as special for humans, but there are elements of it that are found in the animal kingdom, says de Waal -- namely, fairness and reciprocity. His latest study, published this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that chimpanzees may show some of the same sensibility about fairness that humans do. The popular belief that the natural world is based on competition is a simplification, de Waal says. The strength of one's immune system, and the ability to find food, are also crucial. And many animals survive by cooperating. ""The struggle for life is not necessarily literally a struggle,"" he said. ""Humans are a highly cooperative species, and we can see in our close relatives where that comes from."" Mammals such as wolves, orcas and elephants need their groups to survive, and empathy and cooperation are survival mechanisms. De Waal discusses these mechanisms in his 2009 book ""The Age of Empathy: Nature's Lessons for a Kinder Society."" ""We think that empathy evolved to take care of others that you need to take care of, especially, of course, between mother and offspring, which is universal in all the mammals,"" de Waal said. Laboratory chimps get a new lease on life . What it means to be fair . De Waal isn't sure that his monkeys have what a philosopher would call a ""concept of justice"" in an intellectual sense. But the emotional reactions researchers have observed indicates that there is, at a more basic level, a sense of justice among them. Among the questions he investigates: If an animal gets more than another, is there is a feeling that this is somehow unjust? And if one shares food with another, is there an expectation of returning the favor? In a 2008 study, de Waal and colleagues put two capuchin monkeys side by side and gave them a simple task to complete: Giving a rock to the experimenter. They were given cucumbers as a reward for executing the task, and the monkeys obliged. But if one of the monkeys was given grapes, something interesting happened: . As observed in a popular video that de Waal showed in his TED talk, after receiving the first piece of cucumber, the capuchin monkey gives the experimenter a rock as expected. But upon seeing that the other monkey has grapes, the capuchin monkey throws the next piece of cucumber that it is given back at the researcher. Like children, the monkeys feel they ""need to get the same thing as somebody else,"" de Waal said. Based on experiments such as these, de Waal came to believe that the sense of fairness observed in monkeys is egocentric. The capuchin monkeys were upset, selfishly, when they didn't get the grapes that their neighbors received. De Waal believed this model of fairness would apply to chimpanzees also. Chimpanzees are so closely related to us that they share 99% of their DNA with humans. But the new study, which compares chimpanzees to young children, makes de Waal rethink that view. ""Now with this experiment, we are thinking that they have a higher level, where they worry about reward division in general,"" he said, ""and it's now unclear how they differ from humans."" The new study: A human sense of fairness? In the new study, de Waal and colleagues had chimpanzees and, separately, young children, play an ""ultimatum game."" This is ""the gold standard of fairness for humans"" because it has been played all over the world, by people in different cultures, to show that, universally, humans appear to have a sense of fairness. Here's a video of the experiment . The basic structure of an ultimatum game is that there are rewards that can be divided between two individuals. One proposes how to divide them and the other accepts or rejects this offer. If the receiver rejects, no rewards are given out. Human trials have shown that people usually propose a generous division of the goodies, such as half and half or 60% and 40%, de Waal said. In the version used in the new experiment, six adult chimpanzees and 20 human children, between ages 2 and 7, participated. The setup was such that a token could be traded for equal rewards for both partners, and a token that would give more goodies to the partner who made the choice. In some trials, one partner proposes a reward division to the other via a token, and the receiver must accept the token in order for both parties to get rewards. In others, the partner's acceptance is not required. The researchers found that chimpanzees and children both tended to make decisions about splitting rewards similarly to adult humans. In the situation where the responder could accept or reject the division of rewards, both chimpanzees and children tended to split the rewards with their partners. But when the partner was not given the opportunity to reject the proposal, chimps and kids tended to choose the selfish arrangement -- a token that favored the chooser. Controversial results . So, does this mean that chimpanzees show the same sense of fairness as humans? Keith Jensen of the University of Manchester, who has conducted similar experiments in the past, isn't so sure. His results did not show that chimpanzees have a sense of fairness. Jensen is concerned about the results of this new study because it's not clear that the responders knew that they could reject offers. None of the participants, human or chimp, ever rejected the offers of their partners. ""The fact that responders never rejected nonzero offers suggests that they were not sensitive to unfairness but were only motivated by getting food for themselves, regardless of the intentions of the proposers or the consequences for them,"" he said in an e-mail. But de Waal said that responders did display negative reactions in response to some offers. Chimps would spit water and the children would say something like ""You're getting more than me"" in response to a selfish offer. ""That indicates that they know what's going on,"" he said. Jensen also criticized the design of the experiment because participants were primarily interacting with the researchers, not each other. Although one chimp had to pass a token to the other, this could be just a necessary step to get food, not a sign of agreement with the offer, he said. But de Waal stands by the study. There are very few studies of this nature on chimpanzees compared to in humans, and more research should be done to explore the nature of the sense of fairness of human relatives. Meet one of the oldest chimpanzees in captivity . The secret lives of primates . There's still a lot that humans don't know about their close relatives. De Waal has made some fascinating inroads, however, including a study showing that chimpanzees can look at the behind of another chimpanzee and match it to the corresponding face, provided it's a chimp they know. This shows that the chimps have ""whole-body knowledge,"" a concept that has not been rigorously tested in humans, he said. The research won him a 2012 Ig Nobel prize, honoring research that is both humorous and thought-provoking, shared with Jennifer Pokorny. And he has also studied yawn contagion, the phenomenon of one person yawning in response to another person's yawn. Those who are sensitive to yawns tend to be more empathetic people, and friends and family members yawn more with each other than with strangers. This has also been shown in chimpanzees, who will yawn if another chimp they know yawns too. But de Waal isn't sure, for instance, why three females were patrolling their compound when CNN visited in October. Males, though, have a clear purpose in patrolling: In the wild, they do it to protect their territory, de Waal said. Perhaps, he postulates, the females are mimicking the males. Chimp males compete with each other regularly, but also come together to repair their relationships, de Waal said. This pattern of behavior is seen in human families and in the workplace -- these cycles of one-upmanship and reconciliation. ""There are many animals who are very good at cooperation, and I'm personally not convinced that we humans are necessarily best at that, but we are very good at it, that's for sure."" His next book, coming out this spring, is called ""The Bonobo and the Atheist: In Search of Humanism Among the Primates,"" which brings together evidence that there are biological roots in human fairness and addresses the role of religion in society.","Prominent scientist Frans de Waal studies morality in primates .

"(CNN) -- It was not too long ago -- in 2001, prior to the U.S. invasion -- that Afghanistan's women were all but entirely marginalized.

Afghan women, under the Taliban, weren't even allowed to leave their homes without a male escort, and the mandatory burqa became a visual symbol of the regime's all-encompassing oppression. The country still has a long way to go, but giant strides have been made since the Taliban was scattered and broken under the might of the U.S. and allied military. Women's rights were guaranteed under the new, post-Taliban constitution, but there remains a gulf in terms of what is written and what is practiced. Afghanistan remains far from an equal, open society, and outside the capital, Kabul, conservative values still reign. In some parts of the hinterland, the old rules still apply, even if they are no longer being enforced by the Taliban. However, there are indications that women have taken hugely positive steps towards, if not yet equality, a much more active role in the running of the country. And their influence has largely been welcomed. One of Saturday's frontrunners, Abdullah Abdullah, sees the engagement of the country's women as vital to its development. ""If you want to see this country or any other country even being able to deal with the challenges and develop, it cannot happen without the role of half the population,"" he told Britain's Independent newspaper. Since voter registration for Saturday's elections started almost a year ago, 2.5 million names were added to the electoral roll. Of these, over half were women, according to the Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan. This level of engagement is unprecedented in Afghanistan, and shows that women are a hugely significant demographic that needs to be courted. ""I am here to vote today. It's a day to decide about the future of Afghanistan and I would like to ask all women to break their silence and take one step towards progress. If they don't want to do it for themselves they should do it for future generations,"" one female voter told Afghanistan's state news agency Khaama. There are positive signs from the leading candidates, with all three frontrunners pledging to allow women a greater role in government, vowing to support women's rights in their campaign speeches. And while it could be seen as a cynical vote-grabbing move, women's names are also appearing on the ballot, something that would have been unimaginable only 13 years ago. There were three female vice-presidential candidates on Saturday's ballot, although only one, Habiba Sarabi, the former governor of Bamiyan province, is on the ticket of a realistic frontrunner. Campaigning alongside Zamai Rassoul, the establishment candidate, Sarabi represents the potential that Afghan women have to offer. Although it's looking unlikely, should returns show success for Rassoul -- official results aren't expected for weeks -- Sarabi's role as one of his lieutenants would truly be a historic achievement. Rassoul's picking of a female running-mate was ""a victory,"" Shukria Barakzai, a Member of Parliament and women's rights activist told CNN. ""Of course it will have a direct impact for the life of women in Afghanistan. For me it's not enough. We want women to be in every layer of power. ""I believe in ten years we can have a female president. The way Afghanistan is improving, the way women (have) come out, and turned out, the way women voted ...that gives me more energy -- that Afghanistan is ready to have a female president in the near future."" On International Women's Day, the formerly U.S.-based candidate Ashraf Ghani addressed a rally in Kabul which was attended by thousands of women. Uniquely for electioneering in this part of the world, his wife Rula, a Lebanese-American and a Christian, spoke as well. Karzai's wife, in contrast, was rarely if ever seen in public. At the next level of governance, there is further evidence of a burgeoning female movement, with female candidates popping up all over the country. Around 300 female candidates are contesting seats on provincial councils -- a record number. ""The women's vote will not any more be a 'ghost vote' which has time after time been abused by men. This is a kind of message that Afghans have woken up. It's also a clear message that Afghan society has changed,"" says Barakzai, who eschews the burqa that all women had to wear pre-2001, instead typically wearing a more relaxed headscarf loosely on her dark hair. ""The women of Afghanistan... have shown how brave they are."" Her confidence has also been transmitted to her daughter: Too young to vote but full of optimism about the future of her country, and the place of women in it. CNN's Anna Coren asked her what she imagined the coming years could hold. ""Honestly a bright future, a future that is good for us, good for all the people, for girls, good for women -- you know, a bright future!"" she said.","Women an increasingly influential demographic in Afghan politics .
All three frontrunners in Saturday's election have pledged to support women's rights .

"(CNN) -- It's just a newborn in planetary terms, and it's drifting all alone in space without a star to orbit. The solitary life of this newly discovered planet, with the catchy name PSO J318.5-22, has astronomers excited. Only 80 light-years from Earth, the 12 million-year-old planet has properties similar to those of gas-giant planets orbiting young stars. Diamonds produced on other planets? But because it is floating alone through space, rather than around a host star, astronomers can study it much more easily. ""We have never before seen an object free-floating in space that looks like this,"" said Dr. Michael Liu of the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, who led the international team that discovered the planet. ""It has all the characteristics of young planets found around other stars, but it is drifting out there all alone. I had often wondered if such solitary objects exist, and now we know they do."" Stargazing in the desert: The magic of Namibia's night skies . While about a thousand planets have been discovered outside our solar system in the past decade by indirect means -- such as observing the wobbling or dimming of their host stars as they orbit -- only a handful of new planets have been directly imaged, all of them around young stars, according to a release from the Institute for Astronomy. Young stars are those less than 200 million years old. PSO J318.5-22's solitary existence and its similarity to those directly observed planets makes it a rare find. ""Planets found by direct imaging are incredibly hard to study, since they are right next to their much brighter host stars. PSO J318.5-22 is not orbiting a star so it will be much easier for us to study,"" said Dr. Niall Deacon of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany and a co-author of the study. ""It is going to provide a wonderful view into the inner workings of gas-giant planets like Jupiter shortly after their birth."" The astronomers stumbled across it as they sifted through a mountain of data produced by the Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) wide-field survey telescope on Haleakala, Maui. Astronaut: Real space travel much cooler than 'Gravity' The planet, which has only six times the mass of Jupiter, was identified by its faint and unique heat signature. The astronomers were actually searching for failed stars known as brown dwarfs when they came across PSO J318.5-22, which stood out because of its red color. Subsequent infrared observations using other telescopes in Hawaii showed it was no brown dwarf, but rather a young, low-mass planet. By monitoring the planet's position for the next two years, using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, the team was able directly to measure its distance from Earth. This means the astronomers have placed it within a collection of young stars called the Beta Pictoris moving group that formed about 12 million years ago. The star that lends its name to the group, Beta Pictoris, has another young gas-giant planet in orbit around it, the astronomers say. But PSO J318.5-22, which appears to be even lower in mass than that planet, continues to wend its solitary way through the universe, unattached to any star. Newly found planets might support life .","Astronomers find a young, low-mass planet wandering through space alone .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Cinco de Mayo -- the unofficial U.S. holiday long believed to have been imported, with celebratory beer, from Mexico -- isn't a Mexican holiday at all but rather an American one created by Latinos in the West during the Civil War, according to new research by a California professor. Conventional thinking has held that the holiday -- now a commercial juggernaut -- may have grown out of the mass migrations from the bloody Mexican Revolution of the 1910s or even during Chicano Power activism of the 1960s, University of California at Los Angeles Professor David Hayes-Bautista said. But on the 150th anniversary of the holiday, Hayes-Bautista is announcing that he happened upon the true origins of Cinco de Mayo -- the 5th of May -- after poring over Spanish-language newspapers in California from the mid-1800s while working on another research project. Cinco de Mayo must-haves . Cinco de Mayo does indeed mark a Mexican military victory over the invading French army on May 5, 1862, but it's celebrated more in the United States because in 1862, U.S. Latinos of Mexican heritage parlayed the victory as a rallying cry that the Union could also win the Civil War. That's because the French sympathized with the Confederacy, and Hispanics sided with the Union in its fight against slavery and elitism, Hayes-Bautista said. France sought to impose a monarchy over democratic Mexico while U.S. foreign power weakened during the War Between the States. Savor 'the Mexico I know' Hayes-Bautista, a UCLA professor of medicine whose family lore holds his great-great grandfather fought in the famous Cinco de Mayo battle, has just published a new book on the discovery, ""El Cinco de Mayo: An American Tradition,"" which one historian also at UCLA describes as ""of great significance."" Hayes-Bautista was culling Spanish-language newspapers in California and Oregon for vital statistics from the 1800s when he noticed how the Civil War and Cinco de Mayo battle were intertwined. He researches the epidemiology and demography of Latinos in California because he's director of UCLA's Center for the Study of Latino Health and Culture. ""I'm seeing how in the minds of the Spanish-reading public in California that they were basically looking at one war with two fronts, one against the Confederacy in the east and the other against the French in the south,"" Hayes-Bautista said in an interview with CNN. ""In Mexico today, Cinco de Mayo means the Mexican army defeated the French army,"" he continued. ""In California and Oregon, the news was interpreted as finally that the army of freedom and democracy won a big one against the army of slavery and elitism. And the fact that those two armies had to meet in Mexico was immaterial because they were fighting for the same issues -- defending freedom and democracy. Latinos were joining the Union army, Union cavalry, Union navy. ""The French goal was to eliminate democracy, and remember that Mexico had democracy only for 30 or 40 years at that point,"" he added. ""Remember, Europe was ruled mostly by monarchs."" French emperor Napoleon III ""was no friend of the Union and was definitely a friend of the Confederacy and flirted with the Confederacy constantly with the possible recognition of the Confederate government,"" Hayes-Bautista said. President Abraham Lincoln never referred to the Confederacy as a separate government: they were states in rebellion,"" the professor said. Napoleon III's plan was to instill a monarchy over Mexico and ""have that monarch cooperate with the Confederacy,"" Hayes-Bautista said. In early spring 1862, the Union army was unable to move against the Confederates, and American democracy was ""apparently not doing too well,"" Hayes-Bautista said. The French entry into Mexico troubled Hispanics, Hayes-Bautista said. ""Latinos in California were reading about every single battle of the Civil War,"" he said. ""They were very well-informed, and they were reading with a three-week delay of similarly detailed reports from Mexico. So by early May, the French were about 60 miles from Mexico City as some Latinos feared that the Civil War might be over."" But the Mexican army prevailed, and the Spanish-language newspapers in California reported the victory with such headlines as ""HURRAH FOR MEXICO!!! HURRAH FOR INDEPENDENCE!"" In his book, Hayes-Bautista writes: ""In town after town, camp after camp, mine after mine, ranch after ranch, Latinos eagerly absorbed the news. Those who could read shared the glorious details with their illiterate fellows, and up and down the state, Latinos savored the blow-by-blow reporting from the front lines of the conflict that had so riveted their attention."" The Cinco de Mayo victory was then memorialized through a network of Latino groups called ""juntas patrioticas mejicanas,"" or Mexican patriotic assemblies, mostly in California but also in Oregon, Nevada and Arizona, with 14,000 members, Hayes-Bautista said. The juntas celebrated Cinco de Mayo with monthly parades, speeches, dances, banquets and bull fights as a morale builder for Lincoln and Mexican President Benito Juarez, who, despite the Cinco de Mayo victory, was subsequently engaged in a three-year struggle against foreign occupation until 1867. ""From 1862 to 1867, the public memory of Cinco de Mayo was forged in the American West,"" Hayes-Bautista said. Briefly after the Civil War, veterans of the Union and Mexican armies would put on their uniforms and give speeches every Cinco de Mayo, he said. But by 1890, the grandchildren of the veterans and juntas had to be taught about Cinco de Mayo, Hayes-Bautista said. The meaning of the holiday changed over time, becoming a David versus Goliath tale among Mexican immigrants in the 1930s and embodying U.S.-Mexico unity during World War II and Chicano Power in the 1960s and 1970s, Hayes-Bautista said. In his book, he described Cinco de Mayo's ""undeniable commercialization in the late 20th century, a fake holiday recently invented by beverage companies."" In his interview with CNN, Hayes-Bautista stated: ""Now it's become this big commercial holiday and a wonderful opportunity to get services and products in front of the Latino market and it even got its own postage in 1996 and in 2005 President Bush even had a Cinco de Mayo celebration at the White House. ""But if you ask why is anyone celebrating, no one knows. And then you get some people who say it shouldn't be celebrated at all because it's a foreign holiday -- and yet it's as American a holiday as the Fourth of July,"" he said. ""No one has seemed to link it to the Civil War,"" he added about what he called groundbreaking research. UCLA history professor Stephen Aron said Hayes-Bautista's finding is significant. ""For the general public (and even for many historians), the California origins of the Cinco de Mayo holiday come as quite a surprise (since the holiday is so generally presumed to be a Mexican holiday that was only recently imported into the United States),"" Aron said in an e-mail to CNN. ""That Hayes-Bautista's book ties these origins to the American Civil War is also of great significance."" Rounding out the new research into Cinco de Mayo is Hayes-Bautista's family legend that recounts how his great-great-grandfather Bartolo Bautista was part of local militia supporting the Mexican army in the Battle of Puebla. His ancestor, who hailed from the town of San Miguel de Atlautla just below the snow line on the volcano Popocatepetl, was taken prisoner but was spared execution by a French army firing squad after it saw he had a birthmark over his heart. The mark was in the shape of a hand with all five fingers clearly visible, Hayes-Bautista said. The French firing squad had told the prisoners to remove their shirts because the soldiers intended to use the clothing. Superstitious of the birth mark, the French let the man go, Hayes-Bautista said. On Saturday, 150 years later, Hayes-Bautista is scheduled to participate in a Cinco de Mayo celebration at LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes, a Smithsonian affiliate in downtown Los Angeles.","A UCLA professor of medicine happens upon the true origins of Cinco de Mayo, he says in a book .

"(CNN) -- The author of a now-retracted study linking autism to childhood vaccines expected a related medical test to rack up sales of up to $43 million a year, a British medical journal reported Tuesday. The report in the medical journal BMJ is the second in a series sharply critical of Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who reported the link in 1998. It follows the journal's declaration last week that the 1998 paper in which Wakefield first suggested a connection between autism and the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine was an ""elaborate fraud."" The venture ""was to be launched off the back of the vaccine scare, diagnosing a purported -- and still unsubstantiated -- 'new syndrome,'"" BMJ reported Tuesday. A prospectus for potential investors suggested that a test for the disorder Wakefield dubbed ""autistic enterocolitis"" could produce as much as 28 million pounds ($43 million U.S.) in revenue, the journal reported, with ""litigation driven testing"" of patients in the United States and Britain its initial market. Among his partners in the enterprise was the father of one of the 12 children in the 1998 study that launched the controversy, the journal reported. In 2010, after a lengthy investigation, British authorities stripped Wakefield of his medical license, and the Lancet -- which published his original study -- retracted the paper. He has denied any wrongdoing, and a vocal contingent of advocates for children with autism continues to support him. Wakefield did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN. But in an interview on an internet radio site Tuesday, Wakefield again defended his research and called the BMJ series ""utter nonsense."" He said the patent he held was not for a test or an alternative to the MMR vaccine, as BMJ reported, but an ""over-the-counter nutritional supplement"" that boosts the immune system. And he blasted allegations that he used the cases of the 12 children in his study to promote his business venture. ""The children were not exploited,"" he said. ""They were seen because they were sick. They had clinical referrals. They came to us. We responded to a crisis."" He also repeated his attack on the author of the BMJ report, freelance journalist Brian Deer, whom he has accused of being paid by the pharmaceutical industry. In financial disclosure forms, Deer has stated that he has received no such payments. Dr. Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, said that if true, the latest BMJ allegations would indicate a major ethical breach. ""Assuming the facts Deer lays out are correct, it is disappointing that Wakefield in his book casts aspersions on others for all their purported conflicts of interests and failures of disclosure, yet does not examine the same issues in himself,"" Wiznitzer said. ""Therefore, those who are trying to objectively evaluate the situation have up to this point not been given all the facts."" BMJ reported the business venture failed to launch after Wakefield's superiors at University College London's medical school raised concerns in 1999 about a ""serious conflict of interest"" between his research and the company formed to launch his new product. ""This concern arose originally because the company's business plan appears to depend on premature, scientifically unjustified publication of results, which do not conform to the rigorous academic and scientific standards that are generally expected,"" a letter stated. But the university offered him a year's paid absence and help in replicating his original research with a larger group of 150 children in the name of ""good scientific practice."" The follow-up study never occurred, and no other research has duplicated Wakefield's original findings, BMJ reported. He left the university in 2001, and BMJ quotes his former boss as saying the school ""paid him to go away."" The BMJ pieces are a series of investigative reports, not a clinical study. The journal's editor-in-chief, Fiona Godlee, said last week that of the 12 children Wakefield examined in his 1998 Lancet paper, five showed developmental problems before receiving the MMR vaccine and three never had autism. According to BMJ, Wakefield received more than 435,000 pounds (about $674,000) from lawyers trying to build a case against vaccine manufacturers -- a serious conflict of interest he failed to disclose. Most of his co-authors abandoned the study in 2004, when those payments were revealed. The now-discredited paper panicked many parents and led to a sharp drop in the number of children getting the vaccine that prevents measles, mumps and rubella. Vaccination rates dropped sharply in Britain after its publication, falling as low as 80% by 2004. Measles cases have gone up sharply in the ensuing years. In the United States, more cases of measles were reported in 2008 than in any other year since 1997, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 90% of those infected had not been vaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown, the CDC reported. CNN's Miriam Falco contributed to this report.","Dr. Andrew Wakefield expected his test to be used in 'litigation driven"" cases, BMJ says .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Five militants suspected to be behind an airport attack in Peshawar were killed Sunday morning when police raided a house where they were hiding. The militants had taken the owner of the house hostage, said Peshawar Police Chief Imtiaz Altaf. When police raided the residence, two suspects blew themselves up and three others were killed in a gunfire exchange with officers. Police had been looking for the men after three rockets were fired toward Peshawar's Bacha Khan International Airport on Saturday, killing at least nine people. Syed Naveed Qamar, Pakistan's defense minister, said the target could have been an air force base, which is adjacent to the airport. Both the airport and the air base have the same entrance. Mian Iftikhar Hussain, information minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said after the attackers fired the rockets they tried but failed to drive an explosives-laden vehicle into the airport. The vehicle struck the airport's outer wall, blew up and killed five militants. Other than the attackers, four civilians were also killed, Shahid said. He said 35 people were injured as well. Two of the rockets landed inside the airport and the other struck outside the facility. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility of the attack. Taliban official Ehsanullah Ehsan said their target was in fact the air base. ""We have planned more attacks on Pakistani forces and its installation as it works to please the USA,"" Ehsan said.

"VANCOUVER, British Columbia (CNN) -- When Canadian cocaine smuggler Charles Lai was being sentenced in a Seattle federal courtroom last month, the judge sending him to prison for 13 years offered a small item of good news. A suspected gang member in Vancouver is taken out of a bar in handcuffs. At least behind bars, Judge James Robart said, drug smuggler Lai would not become another fatality in Vancouver's gang wars. Authorities in Vancouver, just 30 miles from the border, are struggling to deal with the boom in the drug trade between the United States and Canada, along with the violence that has come with it. Cocaine from Mexico -- and many of the guns that fuel the violence -- come north via the United States. Canadian smugglers then bring south high-quality marijuana known as ""BC Bud"" and synthetic drugs like methamphetamine. A recent U.N. drug report named Canada as the ""primary"" supplier of Ecstasy to the United States. The gang killings are blamed in part over who will control which areas of this estimated $6 billion-a-year narcotics trade. Beyond the string of slayings and shootings that have taken place over the last two years are the new modes in which the violence is carried out. ""It's the type of murders, the more brazen public shootings, the shootings in front of the grocery store with automatic weapons,"" said superintendent Pat Fogarty of the Royal Mounted Police, who oversees a special multi-jurisdictional unit that is taking on the gangs and larger criminal organizations behind them. ""It's common now for gangsters to carry body armor and wear it, to have bulletproof cars,"" Fogarty said. ""What that does is when one gang is shooting up another gang, their .40-calibers aren't able to pierce the body armor of the vehicle or the body armor of the vests. So what we've seen is an elevation in firepower, which is a scary process.""  Watch how authorities are fighting the gangs » . Some of the incidents have already become legend: the car radio repairman killed while fixing a gangster's stereo, thugs shooting up the parking garage of a mall with machine guns, the postal worker refusing to deliver mail to a street where a family with well-known gang ties live. The gangs -- police estimate there at least 120 different groups operating in Vancouver and the surrounding area -- have names like the UN, the Red Scorpions, the Big Circle Boys and the Independent Soldiers. They are mostly homegrown operations or recruits from immigrant communities. Some gang members come from middle-class families and join up expecting the Hollywood version of criminal life. ""These guys act like rock stars,"" said Sgt. Kieron McConnell of the British Columbia Integrated Gang Task Force. It's McConnell's job to remove what he calls ""the mystique of being a gangster."" A 20-year police veteran with a looming frame and completely bald head, McConnell and the officers who patrol with him act as a buzzkill to many gang members' night on the town. The Gang Task Force slowly winds through bars and clubs known for their gangster clientele. Until closing time, the police check for identification and run names. Through an agreement with most of the bars in the city, when police find anyone with a history of violence or drug peddling, they can bounce them from the establishment -- no questions asked. The police's goal is not to harass the gang members, they say, but to remove a potential target from an area full of bystanders. ""We are encouraging them not to bring violence with them to where they socialize,"" McConnell said. Chris Mohan's son did not need to go far, however, to become an innocent victim of the gangs. The violence literally came to his doorstep. In October 2007, Mohan, 22 years old, was walking out of the apartment where he lived with his parents when gang hit men came to murder a neighbor police believe was involved in the drug trade. Mohan was one of six people killed in the shooting. ""They killed Chris, but I got a life sentence,"" Mohan's mother, Eileen Mohan, said of having to live without her son. Despite what they took from her, Eileen Mohan does not show any fear of the gangs. She has become an advocate for tougher sentencing of violent criminals, attends the hearings for the men accused of her son's killing and still lives in the apartment where he died. Her mission now is to hurt gangsters. ""They touched my life illegally, I want to touch theirs legally,"" she said. Even though police say they are taking the fight to the gangs like never before, it remains to be seen if authorities can totally dismantle Vancouver's gangs and the larger criminal organization behind them.  Watch how border agents look for smuggled drugs » . Police say they need legislation passed that would enable them to monitor encrypted cell phone conversations and for the legal system to pass down stiffer sentences on gangsters. Tougher sentences may explain why more Canadian drug traffickers like Charles Lai face a courtroom in America, not Canada. Even though Canadian authorities say they are capable of trying their own criminals, crime experts say police are sometimes all too happy if smugglers are captured in the United States, where they face a less bureaucratic justice system and longer stretches in jail. ""In these regional operations, the tendency has been for the offenders to be arrested, charged and processed in the United States, not Canada,"" said Robert Gordon, director of the School of Criminology at the Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. ""That's an indictment of how we are handling this.""","Thirty miles from U.S. border, authorities in Vancouver confronting gang warfare .

"(CNN) -- A California high school student accused of opening fire on classmates with a 12-gauge shotgun pleaded not guilty to attempted murder and other charges Monday during his arraignment in a California court. A judge set bail at $1.5 million for Bryan Oliver, 16, and scheduled a preliminary hearing for February 21. Oliver, appearing in handcuffs wearing an orange jail uniform and sneakers, answered ""Yes, your honor"" when Kern County Superior Court Judge Michael Lewis asked if he chose to waive his right to a preliminary trial. Oliver is charged as an adult with two counts of attempted murder and three counts of assault with a deadly weapon after opening fire at Taft High School Thursday, wounding two people, one seriously. The two victims, Jacob Nichols and Bowe Cleveland, are expected to recover. Oliver's attorney, David Torres, spoke for his client throughout the hearing, including entering Oliver's not guilty plea when the charges were read. Before the proceeding, Torres filed a motion to bar cameras from the courtroom, concerned that publicity would compromise his client's right to a fair trial. Lewis denied the request, citing an overwhelming public interest and the prosecution's decision to try Oliver as an adult. After Thursday's shooting in the small community of Taft, about 30 miles west of Bakersfield, Kern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood told reporters that the gunman was taken into custody after a teacher persuaded him to drop the weapon and surrender. As the shooting unfolded, the teacher, identified as Ryan Heber, managed to evacuate his students through a back door. But instead of running, Heber had a conversation with the student gunman, authorities said. The teacher had suffered a pellet wound to the head from one of the shots, authorities said. Campus counselor Kim Fields helped distract Oliver as students ran. Both employees were hailed as heroes. ""They stayed and probably distracted him and probably allowed students to get out of the classroom,"" Youngblood said. ""He (the gunman) said, 'I wasn't aiming at you,' and said the name of the student he was aiming at,"" he said. When Oliver was taken into custody, he had a shotgun and about 20 rounds of ammunition, Youngblood said. ""This is a tragedy, but not as bad as it might have been,"" he said. Newtown opens eyes to violence against young . Immediately after the shooting, authorities executed search warrants at Oliver's home, less than a block from the site of the shooting. A motive has not been revealed, but authorities are investigating a theory that bullying may have played a role. A full-time armed police officer was assigned to the school, but authorities said heavy snow in the San Joaquin Mountains prevented the officer from leaving his home. The most seriously wounded victim was airlifted to a hospital in Bakersfield and treated for gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen, Pruitt said. Aurora suspect should face trial, judge rules . U.S. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, whose district includes the town of Taft, expressed sympathy to his constituents. ""I am deeply saddened and troubled by news of the shooting,"" the Republican lawmaker said. U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, whose father graduated from Taft Union High School, expressed her sadness but said the incident was a call for gun legislation reform. ""My thoughts and prayers are with the victims, and I wish them a speedy recovery,"" Feinstein said.

"(CNN) -- The third ""B"" in the collapse of our national security system and the State Department hit this week. The release of five very high-value terrorist leaders as a swap for one U.S. serviceman was the third strike against the Obama administration's policy of defeat, dishonesty and self-delusion. When Congress starts investigating the Bergdahl case it must broaden the analysis to look at the common patterns which connect it to the administration's approach on two other national security questions: Boko Haram and Benghazi. The first was Hillary Clinton's State Department's decision from 2011 to 2013 to reject requests by the FBI, CIA, Justice Department and many congressmen and senators on both sides of the aisle to list Nigeria's Boko Haram as a terrorist organization. Well before Boko Haram abducted more than 200 girls from a school in northern Nigeria in April, the State Department's arguments for keeping the Nigerian extremist group off the list were almost exactly the arguments used to distort what happened in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012, and to justify releasing five extraordinarily dangerous Taliban leaders. Boko Haram, we were told, was a local organization without aspirations to international terrorism. This assessment required us to ignore the fact that Boko Haram's first base camp in northern Nigeria was called ""Afghanistan"" in honor of the Taliban. It required us to ignore the fact that the group burned Christian churches on Christmas Day. It required us to ignore the fact that members of Boko Haram went to Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan for training. None of this, self-delusional ""experts"" in the State Department assured us, meant that Boko Haram was a ""real"" terrorist organization. Then in 2012 came riots in Cairo and Benghazi, among other places in the Muslim world. These were not caused by vicious, anti-American religious extremists, the experts assured us -- that would have violated the State Department ethos of appeasing others and blaming ourselves -- but by a YouTube video. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton eventually went so far as to disavow the content of the video on behalf of the American people. Just as the apology machine began to run at full speed, blaming the obscure filmmaker and absolving the mob of its permanent willingness to attack the United States for any reason, along came the attack that killed the American ambassador and three other Americans in Benghazi. The self-deluding national security machine lied to the entire country and denied what really happened at Benghazi. The driving force in the lies was the Clinton State Department, which specifically asked for the intelligence community analysis to be changed. Now we have the most disastrous of the three ""B's"": Bergdahl. While we can be glad an American soldier has been returned from captivity, the release of five senior enemy commanders is a defeat of the first order. Taliban leader Mullah Omar declared the swap a great victory. The Taliban got everything it asked for. This swap was a surrender, not a negotiation. It's likely that the five Taliban leaders will all go into action immediately. The notion that their presence in Qatar restricts them is just one more example of self-delusion and dishonesty by the State Department. Both the Treasury and the State Department have identified Qatar as a hot bed of fundraising for radical Islamists. The Qataris have consistently meddled in Middle Eastern countries on the side of radicals and against the U.S. The return of the senior Taliban commanders is as big a defeat as America has suffered in a very long time. Who knows how many will die when these five leaders resume their war against the West? Taliban video shows Bowe Bergdahl's release in Afghanistan . President Barack Obama released the five Taliban leaders without ever consulting his Afghan ""allies,"" who must feel very threatened between the previous week's announcement by the president of an arbitrary American withdrawal date and now the unilateral release of five of their mortal enemies. The Left's selfishness, self-centeredness and duplicity abandons allies when they become ""inconvenient."" Obama's foreign policy successes seem to come at enormous cost to other people. The president's argument that we simply had to cut a deal for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl because of his health goes against the American experience in every recent war. In Vietnam, many American prisoners of war were held longer than Bergdahl and 114 died in captivity. In the Korean War, more than 7,100 Americans became prisoners of war and just over 2,700 are known to have died in captivity. The six soldiers at center of Bergdahl debate . What President Obama really did this week is to guarantee a much lower military interest in risking life and limb to take high-value prisoners alive given that there is now a possibility that they will released in the future. Instead, missions will be more focused on killing than capturing these targets. Hillary Clinton wanted tougher deal for Bergdahl, former officials say . The Obama team clearly believed that chanting ""We Don't Leave Americans Behind"" would be a winning argument. Every spokesperson for the administration repeated the line. Susan Rice, now national security adviser, replayed her post-Benghazi role of going on Sunday shows and either misleading or lying to the American people, claiming that this was ""a joyous day."" One final example of the Left's passion for self-delusion and dishonesty. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel asserted that we never negotiated with the Taliban. Other administration figures took up that claim. Opinion: Five tough ethics issues in Bergdahl swap . It is so pathetic a lie it is hard to understand how he could say it with a straight face. The claim is that the Qataris talked to the Taliban. In this case, of course, the Qataris were our agents and were negotiating for us. But we are asked to indulge the deceit. The State Department may be the second-most urgent reform target after Veterans Affairs. Congress should link together the three ""B's"" and understand that we are faced with delusion across our national security apparatus.

"(CNN) -- Following AstraZeneca's most recent rejection of Pfizer's bid, many may ask if this is a lost opportunity for British innovation, or the salvation of it? I think both points of view miss the real story. The key challenge for the UK is not about ownership structure, but about being a hub for the development of 21st-century medicines. To be sure, most of the UK life science sector will be mightily relieved that Britain is still home to two of the global giants of biomedicine. But Britain must not become complacent about bioscience investment. To keep them and other companies investing here we need to continue the prime minister's crusade to make the UK the best place in the world for 21st century medicine design. To understand why, you need to understand the sector. Having worked for fifteen years in the industry -- not for ""Big Pharma,"" but for insurgent biotech companies and charities, who are increasingly the ones discovering most of the new medicines -- the controversy over the proposed merger was fascinating. It highlighted fundamental issues at the heart of the revolution transforming the pharmaceutical industry. The truth is that ""Big Pharma"" is failing to develop enough new medicines. Their old business model -- dependent on producing a steady pipeline of expensive ""blockbuster"" drugs to sell to Western governments -- is broken. Instead, these companies have now become reliant on the smaller and more innovative biotechs (and increasingly charities) to fill their pipelines with a new world of genetically targeted medicines. The pharma sector is radically changing, from being all about the discovery of old style drugs through biological research, to the design of personalized and genetically profiled drugs through research based more in hospitals than pharma factories. To succeed in this new world of 21st century biomedicine, the UK has to unleash the unique power of its public health service the NHS -- a global powerhouse for modern drugs design. If we do so, we can deliver huge benefits to NHS patients, slow death rates in key diseases like cancer, reduce our drugs bill by making the UK the fastest and best place in the world to develop, test and prove these new medicines -- which would allow us to pay a discounted rate -- AND kickstart a 21st century life sciences cluster. It's a massive prize. That's why I was so pleased when the prime minister invited me to help the UK set out our ground-breaking Life Science Industrial Strategy in 2011, which has been internationally welcomed. Different companies are responding to this challenge in different ways. AstraZeneca last year electrified the sector by wholeheartedly embracing the Life Science Strategy, embedding its staff in the Cambridge biotech and hospital campus. Pfizer, meanwhile, is known in the sector as the lead exponent of the M&A model: delivering shareholder returns by acquiring other companies. In either case, the success of the Life Science Strategy was proved when both announced that after closing their respective factory plants in Sandwich and Cheshire, they were moving not to Cambridge, Massachusetts, but Cambridge, UK. The fact that these companies are in the UK, despite our becoming in recent decades one of the slowest and lowest priced purchasers of drugs, is testament to the model we have adopted. The truth is that we need to worry less about who owns these companies -- after all the shareholders in both cases are global, as is the management -- and more about their level of commitment to the UK as a place to develop and sell modern medicines. We need to be rolling up our sleeves and making sure whoever owns the company has a strong commitment to the UK for the right reasons, namely because it is the best place on earth to develop 21st-century medicines. Western governments no longer have a right to expect or demand investment. We have to compete and win it by being more entrepreneurial. The truth is that what really matters is that the UK remains a world-class place to discover and develop new 21st-century medicines. If we get that right, we can be relaxed about where the capital and talent flows from. Without it, we won't have any takeovers to debate. The very possibility of the takeover was a tribute to the UK as a place where people want to do business. For the physical and economic health of us all, long may it remain that way.

"(CNN) -- Philippine navy divers retrieved bodies Monday from inside a ferry that sank last week after colliding with a cargo ship. The discovery of more victims' remains brought the number of people confirmed dead from the disaster in the southern Philippines to 55, the Philippine Coast Guard said. Another 65 people remain missing and 750 have been rescued, it said. The divers found the body of a child Monday near the hull of MV St. Thomas Aquinas, the sunken ferry, the official Philippines News Agency (PNA) reported. They then managed to enter compartments of the vessel and recover more bodies, the agency said, citing Lt. Cmdr. Gregory Fabic, a navy spokesman. But PNA reported that dive operations were suspended later in the day because of bad weather. Another team of divers was expected to arrive within the day to help with the search and rescue efforts, Fabic said. The collision occurred around 9 p.m. Friday in the Mactan Channel about 2 miles northwest of Cebu City, the capital of Cebu province. Echoes of a past disaster . The St. Thomas Aquinas was coming from nearby Butuan City when the collision occurred. The cargo ship, the Sulpicio, which had about 20 people aboard, was leaving Cebu for Davao, a region on the island of Mindanao. The passenger ferry sank, but not before sending out a distress call heard by Coast Guard officials. The cargo vessel involved in the crash -- along with navy, Coast Guard and commercial vessels -- helped in the rescue efforts. Photos from the scene showed a huge hole torn in the yellow bow of the Sulpicio. The sinking recalls one of the worst maritime disasters in world history that took place on December 20, 1987, also off the Philippines. Between 1,700 and more than 4,000 people were killed when the ferry Dona Paz collided with an oil tanker in the Tablas Strait.

"(CNN) -- The video is grainy and shot from far away, but there's no mistaking what it shows: someone jumping out of a plane's wheel well. The Hawaii Department of Transportation on Tuesday released surveillance video taken at Kahului Airport, on the island of Maui, on April 20. It shows a stowaway climbing out of a plane and walking around a tarmac. The teenager, 15-year-old Yahya Abdi, survived the nearly five-hour flight from San Jose, California. He told authorities that he crawled into the wheel well of the Hawaii-bound Boeing 767 and lost consciousness when the plane took off. Yahya, who also goes by the name Yahya Yusuf, endured subzero temperatures at oxygen-depleted heights as high as 38,000 feet, authorities believe. The teen told investigators he was trying to get to Somalia to see his mother and had no clue which plane went where, a law enforcement official told CNN. He is said to have hopped a fence at San Jose International Airport shortly after 1 a.m. April 20 and stayed on the grounds for six hours without getting caught. The teen spent time recovering at a hospital in Hawaii. As of the weekend, he was in the custody of the Santa Clara County Child Protective Services, in California, according to San Jose police spokesman Albert Morales. The spokesman said investigators are looking to talk to the teen, who could face charges. ""We are undetermined on whether or not charges will be filed. We want to interview him as to what was the situation that prompted him to get on the plane. We have to conduct a thorough interview and get the information from the juvenile himself. If in fact it is determined that there was a criminal offense, it will be criminal trespass, which is a misdemeanor in California,"" Morales said.

"(CNN) -- A dozen years ago, jockey Victor Espinoza went into the Belmont Stakes on War Emblem with a chance to win one of sports' great titles, the Triple Crown. But the horse stumbled out of the gate and finished eighth. Espinoza, who has been riding professionally since 1993, told CNN that he is excited to get a second chance for greatness on June 7 on California Chrome. ""I am ready for it this time, and I am prepared to get it done,"" he said Tuesday at Santa Anita Park in California, adding that being in the situation before was a big help. Espinoza said he was never worried about whether California Chrome would be able to wear a nasal strip, as he has in his past six races, all wins. That includes wins at the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes. Stewards in New York voted Tuesday to change the state's policy toward nasal strips on thoroughbreds. ""I think it was very nice of them,"" he said. ""I don't know if it really helps him or not, but he's been running with (them) so why change. Espinoza spoke of his relationship with the horse, which he has ridden for the six-race winning streak. ""He loves to run, and I think he likes it when I let him know that I am in control,"" Espinoza said. ""I want him to listen to me, what I want him to do during the race, and I think he likes that."" Espinoza said he was taking a few days to ""shut down my mind for a little bit."" Even with the Belmont representing the biggest race of his life, he said he was even thinking about it yet.

"(CNN) -- Two U.S. Air Force officers who died in a crash in Laos in 1969 were laid to rest Monday at Arlington National Cemetery and honored with a final flyover -- but not one provided by the U.S. military. Citing budget concerns, the Air Force denied a request to honor the fallen service members with a military flyover. That prompted a private air squadron to step in. ""Unfortunately, the government hasn't been able to supply flyovers for these gentlemen that have served and gave up the greatest sacrifice they could, so all of us have decided to go ahead and fulfill the mission,"" said Calvin Peacock, a volunteer with nonprofit group Warrior Aviation. Maj. James Sizemore of Lawrenceville, Illinois, and Maj. Howard Andre Jr. of Memphis, Tennessee, were shot down in their A-26A Invader aircraft during a reconnaissance mission over Laos during the Vietnam War, according to the Defense Department. The pilots were considered killed in action. The crash site was discovered in 1993, but the pilots' remains were not discovered until April. Military scientists then matched the remains with the dental records of Sizemore, solving the 44-year-old mystery and bringing closure to the families. A flyover is a military ceremonial ritual reserved for the most esteemed of fallen service members. The Department of Defense refused a military flyover for Sizemore and Andre because of the forced budget cuts known as sequestration. The private squadron consisted of a B-25, two P-51s, four L-39 jets and an A-26 Invader, the same type of plane Sizemore and Andre flew. The Warrior Aviation organization is comprised of volunteers, most of whom are veterans. ""People like myself, the Vietnam generation, we know what sacrifice these guys made. It was a true honor to be a part of the group that is allowed to do this. When they asked me to do this, I said, 'Absolutely, it would be a honor, '"" said Warrior Aviation volunteer Larry Kelly.

"(CNN) -- The makers of an over-the-counter male sexual supplement are recalling the product after government tests showed some unlisted ingredients ""pose a threat to consumers,"" the company says. Tests conducted by the Food and Drug Administration found that the supplement X-Rock contained sildenafil -- an approved drug to treat erectile dysfunction -- and related substance, hydroxythiohomosildenafil, the product's manufacturer said in a statement annoucing the voluntary recall. The announcement from the product's manufacturer, X-Rock Industries, was posted on the FDA's website. ""These undeclared active ingredients pose a threat to consumers because sildenafil and hydroxythiohomosildenafil may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs (such as nitroglycerin) and lower blood pressure to dangerous levels,"" X-Rock Industries said. Erectile dysfunction is more common in men with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and heart disease, who are generally more likely to take nitrates, the statement noted. But the company ""has not received any reports of adverse events related to this recall,"" it said. The voluntary recall ""is being conducted with the knowledge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,"" X-Rock said.

"(CNN) -- Part of the power of social networking is the ability to form communities with like-minded individuals. Attorney Brian Cuban is trying to get Facebook to remove pages for Holocaust denial groups such as this one. But what happens when those communities are offensive to others? That issue is at the heart of attempts by a Dallas, Texas, attorney to have social-networking site Facebook remove pages for Holocaust deniers. The Holocaust Denial movement seeks to deny or minimize the Holocaust, in which Nazis killed about six million European Jews during World War II. Attorney Brian Cuban, brother of Dallas Mavericks team owner Mark Cuban, has been trying since last year to have the pages of groups with such names as ""Holocaust: A Series of Lies,"" and ""Holocaust is a Holohoax"" removed from Facebook. He pointed out that Facebook has removed groups based on complaints before and said the site is ""setting the subjective standard on what they remove and what they don't."" ""There is no First Amendment right to free speech in the private realm,"" Cuban said. ""This isn't a freedom-of-speech issue. Facebook is free to set the standard that they wish."" Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt said his company is in agreement with Cuban that the Holocaust-denial pages are offensive and objectionable. Where the two sides part, Schnitt said, is whether people have the right to discuss such ideas on Facebook. ""It's a difficult decision to make. We have a lot of internal debate and we bring in experts to talk about it,"" Schnitt said. ""Just being offensive or objectionable doesn't get it taken off Facebook. We want it [the site] to be a place where people can discuss all kinds of ideas, including controversial ones."" Schnitt said Facebook has drawn the line with pages or groups that attack an individual or incite or threaten violence. Schnitt pointed to the recent removal of the ""Isle of Man KKK"" page, created by residents of the island off the coast of England. Facebook interpreted the page's advocacy of ""cleansing the island of foreigners"" as threatening and inciting violence, he said. Facebook receives lots of reports about such pages and actively polices the site, Schnitt said. Last year Facebook removed several pages posted by Italian neo-Nazis after complaints that they encouraged violence against gypsies. Brian Cuban, who is of Russian Jewish descent, has written about his fight to have the Holocaust-denial pages removed on his site, The Cuban Revolution. He said he contacted Facebook after a conversation with a friend who runs the Jewish Internet Defense Force, a group that monitors and tries to eradicate anti-Semitic online content. The Jewish Internet Defense Force, which was successful in removing a Facebook page for the group ""Israel Is Not A Country! Delist It From Facebook As A Country,"" is outspoken in its own right and sometimes guilty of sweeping generalizations of its own. In an article on Brian Cuban's site published during the 2008 presidential campaign, a representative from the Jewish Internet Defense Force was quoted as saying that ""99.9 percent of Muslims hate us."" The article went on to quote JIDF spokesman on the last Presidential campaign: ""We hope to continue to highlight the issues surrounding [then-candidate Barack Obama's] terrorist connections as well as his racist and anti-Semitic church, which has supported Hamas and the Rev. Louis Farrakhan."" A Jewish Internet Defense Force spokesperson named David, who requested his last name be withheld because his group has received death threats, said Thursday he would rather people not focus on those specific quotes for several reasons, including the fact that it was an ""informal interview"" and Cuban ""would not let us correct any of our statements after we quickly answered him to help him meet his deadline."" But on the matter of Facebook and Holocaust deniers, the Jewish Internet Defense Force has a clear stance. ""Facebook should not provide a platform for hatred, especially as it is against their TOS [terms of service],"" David said. ""Holocaust denial is illegal in 13 countries and represents a form of Jew hatred and hate speech in general."" Deborah Lipstadt is the Dorot Professor of Modern Jewish and Holocaust Studies at Emory University and an expert on Holocaust denial. She said social-networking sites like Facebook are attractive to deniers. ""It allows people to find one another, both for good and for bad,"" she said. ""People who are drawn to Holocaust denial tend to be fringe kind of people who might not otherwise be able to find a group, but this way they can find other like-minded people."" Deborah Lauter, director of Civil Rights for the Anti-Defamation League, said the issue of anti-Semitism and hate speech online is a growing one, partly because of the anonymity the Web offers. Lauter pointed out that Facebook's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities says that users ""will not post content that is hateful, threatening, pornographic, or that contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence."" She said the Anti-Defamation League has worked with sites such as YouTube and MySpace to encourage them to be ""socially responsible corporate citizens."" ""Even though in the States this kind of hate is protected speech, [Web sites] don't have to provide the forum to help spread it,"" said Lauter, whose organization is the U.S. representative for the International Network Against CyberHate. ""Our position is that if you are going to be providing it, then you have to step up and put in the mechanism for policing it.""","Brother of Dallas Mavericks owner wants Facebook to remove offensive pages .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The body of a Palestinian teen slain in Jerusalem will be turned over to his family on Friday, the boy's father said. Hussain Abu Khedair said Thursday the family expects to be given the body of his son Mohammad after Friday prayers. The father said his 17-year-old son likely will be buried later that day. ""We will not bury my son at night,"" he said earlier on Palestinian television. ""We will do it during the day."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged Thursday to find the perpetrators responsible for the boy's killing, an act Netanyahu described as ""a despicable crime."" Abducted Palestinian teen was kind, beloved . Netanyahu made the comment during a speech at the American Embassy in Tel Aviv where he and Israeli President Shimon Peres attended the annual July 4 Independence Day party. Israeli authorities are still trying to determine who killed Mohammad Abu Khedair and why, the Prime Minister said. Mohammad Abu Khedair was heading from his home to a mosque in the middle-class neighborhood of Shuafat for prayers around 4 a.m. when three men forced him into a car and drove off, his father said Wednesday. The boy's body was found about an hour later at a forest in Jerusalem. The killing further inflamed tensions in a region already unsettled over the killings of three Israeli teens, not to mention decades of entrenched enmity between all sides. There are concerns that the Palestinian teenager's funeral could spark further unrest, and demonstrators and Israeli officers clashed again Thursday in the East Jerusalem area of Shuafat. At least 10 Palestinian protesters were injured, according to a CNN team there. Dozens of Palestinians threw stones at Israeli forces who fired rubber bullets and stun grenades. The unrest came as Israelis and Palestinians continue to trade blows over longstanding issues unrelated to Abu Khedair's death. There have been rocket attacks and airstrikes. The Israeli Defense Forces said 40 rockets were launched toward Israel from Gaza on Thursday. One soldier had minor wounds and some homes were damaged, the IDF said. Israel conducted at least eight airstrikes early Thursday. Three hit a Hamas intelligence building in Gaza city, while at least one struck the Qassam training camp in Beit Hanoun. Palestinian medical sources reported at least 10 people injured, one of them seriously. Israel Defense Forces said the airstrikes, going after 15 Hamas targets, were in response to the firing of more than 20 rockets into Israel since Wednesday. This is in addition to other actions -- including the arrests of hundreds of Hamas activists, the demolition of homes and the closure of dozens of institutions in Gaza, according to Netanyahu -- targeting Hamas and focused in Gaza. This action follows the abduction of Israeli teens Eyal Yifrach, Gilad Shaar and Naftali Frankel as they were on their way home from school June 13; the three were found dead on Monday in a West Bank field. Hamas praised the kidnappings but denied that it was responsible for what happened. It warned that if Netanyahu ""brings a war on Gaza, the gates of hell will open to him.""

"(CNN) -- Responding to simmering controversy among Catholic bloggers about her new birth control program, Melinda Gates -- a practicing Catholic -- said she will not shrink from her role as an advocate for poor women. ""Part of what I do with the (Gates) Foundation comes from that incredible social justice I had growing up and belief that all lives, all lives are of equal value,"" said Gates during a recent interview with CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. About the flak over her Catholicism she said: ""We're not going to agree about everything, but that's OK."" Gates is promoting an ambitious family planning program -- which includes raising billions of dollars to provide contraceptives to 120 million women worldwide -- at the London Summit on Family Planning July 11. While most Catholics, in the United States, at least, according to polls, seem to agree with Gates that contraception for women is not controversial, some Catholic bloggers are taking issue with the plan. One blog in particular, LifeSiteNews.com, has frequently published diatribes against Gates, calling into question her faith, and calling her plan a ""blatant attack on Catholic sexual morality."" As far as the broader Catholic church stance on the Gates program, CNN requested a comment from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, but did not get a response. My Take: Catholic bishops against the common good . For her part, Gates is trying to deflect the controversy, and concentrate on what she describes as a real need for contraception to empower women. ""I think we made birth control and contraceptives way too political in the United States,"" said Gates, co-founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. ""I think if people understood that 200 million women want this around the world they would start to say, 'OK that makes sense.' ... We shouldn't make it such a political issue."" Overheard: Contraceptives and Catholicism . According to the Gates Foundation website, the focus of the family planning initiative will be on urban areas in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, areas where maternal and infant mortality rates are high and contraception use is low. ""Africa's the one place really in the world, for the most part, that contraceptives haven't been available and it's really been a crime,"" said Gates. ""If you see what's happened in other countries that have had contraceptives, they use them first of all and the birth rates go down. ... The question is could it have come down even more quickly?"" Gates frequently cites research from a decades-long study in Bangladesh as a rationale for family planning. Given the ability to space out their children using birth control, women can begin what Gates calls a ""virtuous economic cycle."" The study, started in the 1970s in Matlab, compared a group with access to contraception and birth-control education to a similar group that did not have access to those things. My Take: The myth and reality of the Catholic vote . ""(In) the community that had access to contraceptives, the women chose to use them, the families grew up wealthier, fewer women died in childbirth,"" said Gates. ""And what we're seeing happening with that is that it's playing out again all over the world. These small scale things you have in terms of giving a family the access leads to huge economic changes. "" To effect that cascade of economic change worldwide will take $4 billion, according to Gates. The London summit kicks off the Foundation's official campaign for support and funding for that effort. No doubt, the family planning initiative will roll out despite Catholic protestations, and Gates says this is the issue for which she hopes to be remembered. ""I work on a broad set of foundation issues,"" said Gates. ""But this one for me has really grasped my heart and my mind. She added: ""This will be my lifetime's work at the foundation.""

"(CNN) -- Timekeeping in the United States, which was already a pretty precise science involving lasers and atomic particles, just got even more exact. A new atomic clock, so accurate it will lose or gain only one second every 300 million years, was unveiled Thursday by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a branch of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The NIST-F2 had been in development for about a decade and is three times more accurate than the F1, which has been in use since 1999. The institute will continue operating both clocks for now at its campus in Boulder, Colorado. The clock is used for civilian purposes in the United States and its data is shared with the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris. The clocks work by using lasers to create a fountain of cesium atoms. ""Pings"" from those atoms as they move are counted to measure the exact length of a second. Tom O'Brian, chief of NIST's time and frequency division, said the F2 was made more accurate by lowering the temperature of the area surrounding it. All that is fine. But why go to all this trouble? Most of us won't get fired for being a few trillionths of a second late for work, right? Well, no. But many of the systems we use in our high-tech world need to be a lot more precise. ""Modern telecommunication networks require synchronization to about a millionth of a second per day,"" O'Brian said. ""Power grids also ... (and) GPS systems require about 1 billionth of a second per day. ""All of these technologies, and many more that we use every day, rely on exquisite timing and synchronization that is only possible with atomic clocks."" The NIST-F2 is expected to lose about one trillionth of a second per day. That's way more accuracy than any of today's technology needs and, hopefully, will be plenty for the next generation of innovation as well. ""If we've learned anything in the last 60 years of building atomic clocks, we've learned that every time we build a better clock, somebody comes up with a use for it that you couldn't have foreseen,"" says physicist Steven Jefferts, lead designer of NIST-F2. So, is the NIST-F2 as good as it gets? Not really. While it might be the most accurate atomic clock to use cesium, researchers say there are already clocks that use other atoms being tested and that those are even more precise. Some of those divide time into units more than 100 times more accurate than even the brand-new F2, O'Brian said. ""I think all those clocks are going to be so good that we're really going to have to change our perspective about what we mean by 'time',"" he said.","New U.S. atomic clock is unveiled Thursday .

"(AOL Autos) -- Some antiquated state driving laws are flat-out crazy. Got a housecoat? If you're a woman, it's illegal to wear one while driving in California. But what about modern rules of the road that seem very unusual and can still result in a hefty fine? In California, no vehicle without a driver may exceed 60 miles per hour. But who gets the ticket? We've collated some of the more irregular and disputed road laws from around the nation and have included, at the end, some of the more bizarre contributions that have kept our roads the safest in the world. Ahem. Driving too slowly . In some states, including California, a dawdling motorist can be cited for driving too slowly. Police Officer Pete Kim of the California Highway Patrol says that while it's not common, you could get a ticket if, ""you're blocking traffic or creating a road hazard on the freeway."" He mentions a couple reasons why someone would drive that slowly. The car could be suffering engine trouble or the driver could be impaired, for example. Both will likely attract the attention of a police officer. Drivers on city or rural roads are not exempt, says Police Officer Kim. He adds, ""Just about anywhere, if you're in the middle of an intersection or on a regular two-lane street and the speed limit is 45 [mph] and you're doing 10 [mph] for no good reason, you can be cited for impeding traffic."" Slow driving laws are enforced in most states, including Florida, Nevada, Alaska and Hawaii, where tourists can be most at risk from the police scanner. You should also beware of rubbernecking accidents or police lights, which, while non-ticketable in most cases, doesn't particularly help traffic cops do their jobs. Red-light running . Garland, Texas motorist Noel Hillis was ticketed by cameras earlier this month for running a red light. He told local station CBS11 that he crossed the stop line as the light was turning red, but that at his hearing the police officer gave him a different characterization of the stop line. The police officer says the stop line is a lateral line parallel to the curb of the cross street or, ""ten feet farther out than where it actually starts."" Texas law states that the violation line is at the stop line before the crosswalk. The editor of road campaign site www.highwayrobbery.net, a businessman and activist who requested anonymity, tells AOL Autos, ""The law, as I understand it, is that you're okay to proceed across the line if you can get any bit of your car ahead of the line. Typically the limit line is the first line you come to if there's a crosswalk -- which are sometimes surprisingly wide -- so the crosswalk can end up being 10 to 15 feet from the curbs of the crossing street. Somebody looked at the pictures and realized that cities were using an imaginary line, sometimes that of the curb, that you have to get part of your car over to not get a ticket, an extra 12-foot zone."" The governor of Texas has said he will sign a bill later this year to clear up confusion after scores of motorists' complaints concerning crossing of violation lines, which is usually a civil offense. Animals and cars . London couple Yisroel Singer, 26, and his wife Goldie, 25, say they were the victims of a ""cultural misunderstanding"" after they were arrested and held in New York several years ago. They had left their six-month-old daughter in the car while they went to Green Acres mall. They said nobody in Britain would condemn their actions, but under U.S. law, they faced a sentence of one year for child endangerment if they were found guilty. The case was eventually dropped. Now it's illegal in many states to leave an animal alone in a car, and with good reason. The Animal Law Coalition points out that, even with the vehicle's windows left slightly open, an outside temperature of 85 degrees can cause a temperature of 102 degrees inside a vehicle within 10 minutes, and 120 degrees within half of an hour. As dogs breathe differently from humans, their central nervous systems can be overwhelmed in less than 15 minutes from excessive heat. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger last year signed into law Bill SB1806, which bans owners from leaving animals unattended in a motor vehicle ""under conditions that endanger the health or well being of an animal due to heat, cold, lack of adequate ventilation, or lack of food or water, or other circumstances that could reasonably be expected to cause suffering, disability, or death to the animal."" First-time violators are fined $100, with a second offense garnering a possible six-month jail term. Also remember, smoking with children of car-seat age in the car will draw you heat in Texas, Vermont, Washington, Arkansas and Louisiana among others. As of yet, there is no law about smoking with pets in the car. Carpool violations . Several states face the thorny issue of their carpool lanes moving too slowly. Some carpoolers have accused single-occupant hybrid drivers of soft-pedaling to save gas. But from California to the D.C. Beltway, it seems the sheer volume of cars using the carpool lanes has slowed the lanes enough to almost destroy the incentive of car-pooling or owning a hybrid car. California is considering allowing motorists to exit and enter the carpool lane at will, when previously crossing the double yellow was an offense. The state transportation agency has warned against increasing the occupancy of carpool cars from two to three in Los Angeles, like it is in San Francisco. Beware that buying an easily recognizable hybrid such as a Prius now does not mean automatic rights to use the carpool lane, at least in the Golden State. This is something police officers are well aware of given the recent shortage of available hybrid permits. The black market for scarce carpool lane exemptions has put up to a $5,000 premium on sales of used Prius that carry the exemption sticker. The ridiculous . An assortment of seemingly crazy state driving laws exists and can be found easily across the Internet. Most of these examples are sourced from newspapers and come from the site www.dumblaws.com, whose editors did not respond to a call for comment. Here goes: . In California, no vehicle without a driver may exceed 60 miles per hour. In Florida, if an elephant, goat or alligator is left tied to a parking meter, the parking fee has to be paid just as it would for a vehicle. In Montana, it is illegal to have a sheep in the cab of your truck without a chaperone. In Oregon, a door on a car may not be left open longer than necessary. In Tennessee, it is illegal shoot any game other than whales from a moving automobile. Good luck finding a whale in Tennessee!

"(CNN) -- When the chips are down, the world may one day owe a debt of gratitude to a group of potato farmers high up in the mountains of Peru. Not small potatoes: Preserving potato varieties in Peru is vital to global food security. Thanks to a new $116 million global fund established this summer, the Quechua Indians are being paid to maintain their diverse collection of rare potatoes and ensure that they will be available to help the world adapt to future climate change. The Quechua are one of 11 communities around the world, chosen for the important collection of crops they farm, which together are part of a major new initiative to ensure that the world has the options it might need to cope with future food crises. Other countries involved include Cuba, where they will be focusing on maize and beans, as well as oranges in Egypt and wheat in Tanzania. The fund, a cornerstone of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA), aims to maintain a reservoir of essential species for all our major food crops. ""Agricultural biodiversity is essential,"" Dr Shakeel Bhatti, Secretary of the Treaty, told CNN. ""It is really the global insurance that in the future we will be able to adapt to problems like climate change and population growth."" Just as biodiversity is now seen as the cornerstone of the resilience of natural world, so having a broad variety of agricultural crops is essential to the resilience of agriculture. Different species of plants are often able to cope with widely differing environmental conditions and many obscure varieties could hide vital disease resistance. But the world's valuable diversity is disappearing incredibly fast. ""The figures are quite disturbing,"" said Dr Bhatti. Over the millennia, humans have relied on more than 10,000 different plant species for food. Today, we have barely 150 species under cultivation -- and of those only 12 species provide 80 percent of all of our food needs. Four of those -- rice, wheat, maize and potatoes -- provide more than half of our energy requirements. As global markets have grown and seed production and agriculture become more commercialized, the old system of farmers saving their own seeds - and by doing so a myriad of different crops, often closely adapted to local conditions - has almost disappeared. As a result variety is dwindling towards a vanishing point. China has lost 90 percent of the wheat varieties it had just 60 years ago. In the United States more than 90 percent of fruit tree and vegetable varieties found in farmers' fields at the beginning of the twentieth century are no longer there. Mexico has lost 80 percent of its corn varieties. India has lost 90 percent of its rice varieties . ""They're gone; they've disappeared forever,"" said Dr Bhatti. ""From a food security point of view this makes the world's farmers much more vulnerable to pests... and increases the vulnerability of some poor countries to price shocks in global commodity markets."" The ITPGRFA has two major aims: to prevent the loss of underused crops and ensure the full diversity of common crop species is maintained. It has already enabled the establishment of a seed bank containing 1.1 million varieties that opened in Svalbard, Norway, in 2008. But now the focus is on crop varieties than cannot be stored in this way -- such as potatoes. Historically, both the 19th century Irish Potato Famine and the Bengal Famine, in India, are hard lessons in what happens when we rely too much on a small range of species that are hit by disease. But, according to Dr Bhatti, there are problems around the world now that offer a glimpse at what could happen in the future if we don't maintain our vigilance. Wheat Stem Rust is a devastating wind-born disease affecting cereals that has spread across Africa and is now in the Middle East, and migrating further eastwards. ""If it reaches South Asia and China then millions could face a major threat to food security,"" says Dr Bhatti. In southwest Australia years of drought, believed to be linked to climate change, have had a huge impact on rice production. ""It has almost wiped out the sector,"" said Dr Bhatti. Although the ITPGRFA was agreed in 2001, and came into affect in 2004, but for the last five years signatories have been locked in negotiations over how the scheme would be financed. It wasn't until a conference in Tunis in June 2009 that the deadlock was broken with the new $116 million benefit sharing fund, which will fund the 11 projects. There are also contracts to ensure those countries that are centers of diversity -- often poorer nations -- benefit when species are used commercially by richer nations. ""That was a major step forward,"" said Dr Bhatti. ""We now have tremendous confidence in the system; the treaty is on track."" Rich signatories, such as Norway, Spain and Italy, have agreed to provide the rest of the funds within five years, and according to Dr Bhatti the U.S. has expressed a desire to sign up after disinterest during the Bush administration. So successful is the model established by the ITPGRFA that the World Health Organization is looking at it as a way of sharing information on viruses, including influenza; there are also plans for a bank of animal genetic material. ""I must say I have been so delighted by the Tunis conference this year,"" said Dr Bhatti. ""To a certain extent we were at a crossroads, but we completely came through. It was a quantum leap; a major thing. We are moving forward.""","New multi-million global fund to preserve agricultural biodiversity .

"(EW) -- Early in her career, Helen Mirren specialized in playing hot-blooded schemers and even hotter-blooded seductresses. In films such as ""Hussy,"" ""The Long Good Friday"" and ""The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover,"" she combined the classic femme-fatale ingredients of smarts and sensuality into a molten cocktail of deliciously unpredictable danger. Now, at 69, Mirren seems to have become typecast as stern snoots and blue-blooded battle-axes. What happened? The obvious answer is that she got older in an industry that fetishizes youth, especially female youth. But I think there's something else at work. I'm convinced that Mirren was so indelible as the tough-as-nails inspector Jane Tennison on the excellent British series ""Prime Suspect"" that most folks — including Hollywood casting directors — have had a difficult time seeing past the hard edges and frosty hauteur that come so effortlessly to her. Oprah and Steven Spielberg talk 'Hundred Foot Journey' Mirren certainly starts off that way in ""Chocolat"" director Lasse Hallström's latest feel-good slice of food porn, ""The Hundred-Foot Journey."" But one of the formulaic film's few surprises is how the marvelous actress slowly blossoms from a stubborn prig into a romantic softy. For the first time in ages, she lets us see the frisky grin behind the scowl. Based on Richard C. Marais' 2010 novel — and produced by Steven Spielberg and the queen of spoon-fed sentimentality, Oprah Winfrey — ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" is a culture-clash confection about two rival restaurateurs competing for the hearts and taste buds of the same sleepy French village. On one side of the street is Le Saule Pleureur, a Michelin-starred temple to foie gras, pigeon with truffles, and other refined delicacies lorded over by Mirren's condescending Madame Mallory. On the other is Maison Mumbai, an open-air bazaar of exotically earthy fare cooked with a sprinkle of turmeric and a heavy dose of love by the Kadam family. Q&A: Helen Mirren . Madame does everything she can to foil the newcomers from India, not because she's a racist (the film makes a point of her firing her xenophobic French chef) but because their restaurant, with its roaming livestock and blaring bhangra music, offends her refined Gallic sensibilities. ''Who are zees people?'' she asks with her nose in the air and a stick firmly lodged up her derriere. It's war. The battle unfolds with all the predictability of a train-station timetable. The Kadams, headed by the widowed patriarch (Om Puri) and his soulful chef son, Hassan (Manish Dayal), awaken the parochial palates of the hamlet's quirky residents. When Hassan proves to be just as gifted at conjuring up a mouthwatering béchamel sauce as he is with tandoori goat, Madame wants him to help her win a second Michelin star. (He also turns out to be a natural at wooing her sous chef, played by Charlotte Le Bon.) All of these by-the-numbers beats go down smoothly enough (at least until a jarring third-act detour sends Hassan to Paris). It's soothing, easily digested comfort food. Which is to say it's the perfect recipe for a filmmaker like Hallström. Boys Of Summer: Three of this season's heartthrobs . The director of ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" and ""The Cider House Rules"" is a master at crafting a certain kind of well-appointed sap and manipulating audiences' tear ducts (I get a lump in my throat just thinking about his 2009 Richard Gere sobfest, ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale""). But as talented as he is at eliciting Pavlovian emotional responses with his middlebrow melodramas, he also makes you resent him as soon as you crumple and toss your Kleenex. He rarely earns the catharsis he's after. Thankfully, here he has Mirren and Puri as his sparring leads. I never entirely bought the flirty détente between the two or believed in the rapturous power of a perfectly cooked sea urchin to solve the world's problems. But for two hours, at least, I swallowed it with a smile. Grade: B . See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- The view from above southern Egypt is stunning, a contrast of beige desert valley giving way to green farmland, including fields of sugar cane. Tourists soak in the sight by hiring hot air balloons that have large baskets to carry passengers hundreds of feet above the countryside. Tuesday morning, as one of the balloons prepared to land, an explosion pierced the air, followed by a spreading billow of smoke. ""My first thought was that it was sugar cane that was burning,"" said Christopher Michel, a photographer who was a passenger in another balloon at the time. Smoke from the burning sugar cane painted the ancient city of Luxor below with an eerie haziness. But the concern shown by the balloon pilot and the blaring sirens from emergency vehicles told Michel that something was wrong. He could not imagine the extent: One of the balloons had exploded, and its 21 passengers and operators plummeted about 1,000 feet (300 meters) to the ground. By Tuesday afternoon, the number of dead had climbed to 19, making it the world's deadliest hot air balloon accident in at least 20 years. ""This juxtaposition of this great beauty and this wonderful country and this horrible tragedy is just really shocking,"" Michel told CNN. ""We all feel terrible."" It was an early, dark morning, Michel said, and uneventful for 45 minutes until they started to descend. He was overlooking mud-brick buildings and fields, with the Valley of the Kings in the distance, when the explosion shattered the quiet of the morning. It was a gas explosion, state-run EgyNews reported. Passengers in the balloon included 19 foreign tourists: nine from Hong Kong, four from Japan, three from Britain, two from France and one from Hungary, officials said. An Egyptian pilot and another Egyptian also were on board, Luxor province spokesman Badawi al-Masri said. Two people -- a Briton and the pilot -- are hospitalized. Balloon rides offering panoramic aerial views of the Nile River and the ancient temples of Karnak and Hatshepsut are a popular tourist attraction in Luxor, about a nine-hour drive southeast of Cairo. ""You can see Valley of the Kings in the background bordered by farmland,"" Pauline Liang of Vancouver, Canada, told CNN's iReport last year. ""Below were banana farms, and behind us was the city of Luxor. There was a great contrast between desert landscape, lush farmland and urban development."" Tuesday's crash prompted Gov. Izzat Saad of Luxor province to ban all hot air balloon flights until further notice. Conflicting reports emerged about the company that operated the doomed balloon, Sky Cruise. The head of the country's civil aviation authority said the company was licensed and working legally, EgyNews reported. The agency has begun an investigation of the incident, Mohammed Ibrahim Sharif said. According to Sharif, a fire broke out in the balloon while the workers were trying to land it, just feet from the ground. The balloon then shot upwards again, he said. The balloon's basket was divided into four parts, he said, each holding five passengers. Meanwhile, Luxor's chamber of tourism said the company had previous violations, EgyNews reported. Several balloon companies had terminated contracts with the local meteorological service after the Egyptian revolution, Tharwat Agami, chairman of the chamber of tourism, said. Sky Cruise and other companies were known to violate safety and security instructions by flying out of East Luxor, instead of the recommended West Luxor, he said. Comparing it to a previous hot air balloon experience in another country, Michel noted that there was no safety briefing before the Luxor balloons lifted off the ground, but added that he felt safe during the trip. From what he could tell, the doomed balloon was not overloaded, he said on his Twitter account. Luxor is among Egypt's top tourist draws. Visitors go to see ancient temples and tombs, and travel sites often recommend the hot air balloon trips. The last hot air balloon accident in Luxor occurred in 2009, when 16 foreign tourists were injured after a balloon struck a cell phone transmission tower. Until Tuesday's incident, the deadliest accident in recent memory took place in 1989, when 13 people were killed as two hot air balloons collided in Australia. Egyptian government spokesman Alaa Hadidi announced that the Cabinet will form a committee from the Ministry of Civil Aviation to investigate Tuesday's accident, EgyNews said. CNN's Housam Ahmed and Hamdi Alkhshali, along with journalist Adam Makary in Cairo, contributed to this report.","NEW: Conflicting reports emerge over company's safety record .

"(CNN) -- ""9 hours down, 150 to go."" It seems like any run-of-the-mill Facebook status update. But what its poster, Matt Guthmiller, is attempting is anything but routine. The 19-year-old is on a solo flight that he hopes will take him around the world. If he completes it, he will become the youngest American ever to do so. The ""9 hours down"" refers to the time it took the MIT freshman to fly Saturday from El Cajon, California, to Aberdeen, South Dakota, the first leg of his odyssey. The ""150 to go"" marks the remaining hours he plans to fly over the next six weeks on a plan that will take the South Dakota native through Athens, Greece; Cairo; Bangkok, Thailand; Honolulu, Hawaii, and more. ""Setting a record is exciting, but records are made to be broken,"" Guthmiller said on a website dedicated to the voyage. ""My real goal is to inspire other young people to attempt things of a similar magnitude. That's what I hope to accomplish with this flight."" If successful, Guthmiller will replace Jack Wiegand of Fresno, California, as the youngest American pilot to circumnavigate the globe alone. In June 2013, Wiegand accomplished the feat at 21, according to Guinness World Records. On Wednesday, Guthmiller plans to fly from Teterboro, New Jersey, just outside of New York City to St. John's in Newfoundland, Canada according to the flight itinerary he posted. It will be his final stop in North America until a planned touchdown in Hawaii more than a month later. If all goes as planned, Guthmiller will land his 1981 prop powered Beechcraft Bonanza back in Aberdeen on July 12 -- just 42 days after beginning the trip. According to Guthmiller, the single-engine plane, which normally seats six, has a range of 2,800 nautical miles, can reach a speed of 175 knots, and has a maximum cruising altitude of 11,500 feet.","19-year-old Matt Guthmiller is on a solo flight around the world .

"(CNN) -- A vaccine designed to prevent cervical cancer is coming under fresh scrutiny amid thousands of complaints linking it to a range of health problems. Gardasil has been the subject of 7,802 ""adverse event"" reports from the time the Food and Drug Administration approved its use two years ago, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Girls and women have blamed the vaccine for causing ailments from nausea to paralysis -- even death. Fifteen deaths were reported to the FDA, and 10 were confirmed, but the CDC says none of the 10 were linked to the vaccine. The CDC says it continues to study the reports of illness. Gardasil prevents the spread of human papillomavirus, known as HPV -- a sexually transmitted virus that can cause cervical cancer in a relatively small number of girls and women. The vaccine's manufacturer, Merck & Co. Inc., says it has distributed more than 26 million Gardasil vaccines worldwide, including nearly 16 million in the United States. It estimates that 8 million girls and women have received the vaccine in the United States since June 2006.  Watch more on complications linked to Gardasil » . Two girls allege in court that the vaccine made them sick. One -- Jesalee Parsons of Broken Bow, Oklahoma -- got the shot at age 13. Jesalee's lawyer, Michael McLaren, said she got the shot on February 27, 2007 and soon developed a fever and felt pain. The next day, he said, Jesalee felt pain in her chest and abdomen. Her mother, Laura Parsons, said Jesalee spent weeks in the hospital and underwent two surgeries after developing pancreatitis. She says the federal government should have studied the drug more before approving its use. ""I just feel let down by the government,"" Parsons said. Merck says it could be a coincidence that the girls got sick after receiving the vaccine. The company said in a statement that an adverse event report ""does not mean that a causal relationship between an event and vaccination has been established -- just that the event occurred after vaccination."" Merck said it would continue to evaluate reports of adverse reactions. It said it ""updates product labels with new safety information as appropriate.""","7,802 ""adverse event"" reports to CDC since Gardasil was approved .

In a campaign that went online over the holiday weekend, Brown's goal was to raise only $10. He tempered any expectations -- if there were any. ""It might not be that good.

"(CNN) -- The tragic hot air balloon crash in Luxor on Tuesday comes at a time when Egypt's tourism industry has been struggling to prove that the country is still safe to visit in the wake of the 2011 revolution. Nineteen people died when canisters aboard the balloon exploded over Luxor, a popular destination for tourists visiting its ancient temples and tombs. Read more: Egypt balloon explosion probe could take two weeks . International tourism has long been a mainstay of the Egyptian economy, with United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) figures showing it generated $10.1B in 2012. ""To give you an idea, international tourism generates more income to Egypt that the Suez Canal ($5.1B in 2011 as compared to $8.7B from tourism that same year),"" UNWTO chief of communications Sandra Carvao said. ""In terms of the impact on jobs, tourism employs directly nearly 18 million people."" In January -- two years after the start of the 2011 uprising that overthrew long-time Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak-- protests again took place in Egyptian cities. Official media reported that at least seven people were killed during clashes between anti-government protesters and those loyal to new President Mohamed Morsi. Read more: What's behind the latest wave of violence in Egypt? Nadejda Popova, senior travel and tourism analyst at market research company Euromonitor International, acknowledged that the ongoing political unrest -- as well as Europe's economic downturn -- had affected Egyptian tourism. But she said Egypt remained a key Middle Eastern tourism destination and that there were indications that there had been a slight recovery in 2012. Euromonitor's preliminary figures suggested that there had been a 4% rise on 2011 to 9.4 million tourism arrivals -- as well as signs investors had not given up on Egypt's tourism market, she said. The UNWTO's 2012 data also pointed to what Carvao described as ""a clear recovery in demand"", with a 17% increase in tourism arrivals, to 11.2 million. How safe is hot air ballooning? However, Popova said numbers were still down, with the political transition ""heavily impacting"" Egyptian tourism. ""It is far away from the pre-crisis levels when we had 12 million, for example, in 2010 tourist arrivals in the country,"" she said. ""The political instability and the continuous uprising have been probably among the biggest threats to this recovery."" Popova said she expected numbers to return to their pre-crisis levels by 2017. Earlier this month Egypt's tourism minister, Hisham Zazou, told CNN that live webcams were being installed in holiday hotspots to prove that the country's tourism industry was healthy. Footage of holidaymakers ""basking in the sun"" would give Egypt's tourism industry more credibility, he said. ""When [tourists] see it, they will come."" Read more: Egypt's tourism minister -- Webcams will prove we're safe . Popova said the Egyptian authorities were developing strategies to strengthen tourism with a focus on diversifying the market. In 2012, Russia remained one of the leading countries in terms of arrivals, alongside travelers from the UK, Germany and Italy, but the tourism ministry was trying to lure in more travelers from other markets such as Asia and Latin America, she said. Morsi's decision to host Mahmoud Ahmadinejad-- the first Iranian president to visit Egypt in more than 30 years -- was potentially another way of diversifying the consumer segment, she said. Read more: Shoes hurled at Iranian President Ahmadinejad during trip to Cairo . Travel journalist and senior travel editor at Britain's The Independent newspaper Simon Calder said an increase in interest from Asia was unfortunately reflected in the list of the dead from the Luxor disaster. Officials said those on board included nine tourists from Hong Kong, four from Japan, three from Britain, two from France and one from Hungary. The last thing post-revolutionary Egypt needed was ""a tragedy of this magnitude,"" Calder said. ""Even though -- during the entire two years to my knowledge -- not a single tourist has been harmed, it gives the impression of a state unraveling where security cannot be guaranteed,"" he said. It's a tremendous thing and great tribute to the people in the country that they've managed to protect their guests, however this is possibly going to create a different image."" Popova said while she did not expect the crash to have ""major repercussions"" for Egypt's tourism industry as a whole, it had tarnished its image. Egypt's temporary ban on balloon flights -- introduced after the crash -- was ""an indication the authorities are concerned not only about the safety of the people but also about their image and how people perceive them,"" she said. The disaster was a blow for an industry ""trying everything in their effort to bring people back to the country,"" she said.","Nineteen people --mainly foreign tourists -- died in a ballooning disaster in Luxor on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- FIFA's anti-racism Task Force proposed the attendance of officials to specifically ""identify potential acts of discrimination"" at matches when the newly-created body first met on Monday. Chaired by FIFA vice president Jeffrey Webb, who presides over the continental CONCACAF body, the Task Force also suggested the possibility of points deductions and/or relegation for ""reoffenders or for serious incidents"". The Task Force will present a draft resolution at the FIFA Congress in Mauritius at the end of the month whereupon member associations will vote on the measures. ""We have a special responsibility in the way we can impact football and society,"" said Webb during his opening remarks in Zurich. ""One of the opportunities this task force has is its vast reach throughout FIFA's 209 member associations, where we can implement the resolutions in every region and every country where football is played, bringing universality to the mechanisms that combat racism and discrimination."" The creation of the Task Force was announced in March after a series of racial incidents affecting the sport. In England, both Luiz Suarez and John Terry received bans for racial abuse in separate incidents that took place in 2011 but the story that made headlines around the world came when Milan's Kevin-Prince Boateng led his team off in a friendly in protest at racism from supporters this January. Boateng was swiftly invited by Blatter to FIFA headquarters and was one of the first names added to the makeup of the Task Force, but the Ghanaian did not attend Monday's meeting due to playing commitments. ""K-P Boateng and Jozy Altidore didn't make today's FIFA meet,"" tweeted Task Force member Osasu Obayiuwana, a football journalist and lawyer. ""I hope they attend the next session. Views of active players are crucial."" In their absence, the Task Force suggested that officials attend games to identify discriminatory acts ""with the aim of easing the pressure on referees and facilitating the availability of evidence, which is not always easy to obtain"". The second proposal is likely to be of more interest to fans, especially those who have long argued that points deductions are a more efficient punishment for clubs and national teams than paltry fines. The Task Force suggested the application of sanctions in two stages, with the threat of ""a warning, a fine or the playing of a match behind closed doors"" for ""a first or minor offence"". For more serious incidents and those who reoffended, the Task Force spoke of ""points deductions, expulsion from a competition, or relegation"". The third proposal from the new body was for the ""need to implement the existing sanctions in a harmonized way across all confederations, member associations and leagues"". FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who courted controversy in 2011 when telling CNN that racism could be settled by a handshake after the match, announced his satisfaction with the inaugural meeting. ""Very happy with first Task Force Against Racism & Discrimination meeting,"" he tweeted, before later adding ""We want strong & consistent sanctions at all levels of football for any discriminatory act."" A second Task Force meeting is planned for later in the year to discuss how to educate those in football in a manner which reduces discriminatory acts in the game.","FIFA's new anti-racism Task Force meets for first time on Monday .
Initial proposals include attendance of officials to monitor racism .

"(CNN) -- Two tech companies are offering a free tool to defeat sophisticated malicious software that criminals have used to extract millions of dollars in ransom payments from small businesses and other computer owners. The software from FireEye and Fox IT can help victims decrypt files that were locked by the malware Cryptolocker. The scheme typically worked this way: Victims would click a seemingly legitimate email, which automatically downloaded the malware on their computers. Upon infection, victims would lose access to their files and criminals would demand payment in order to regain access. The Justice Department announced in June it had taken down the Cryptolocker malware. The malware remains defunct, but there are many victims whose files were locked by criminals and remain held hostage. Since emerging in 2013, Cryptolocker has been used to attack about 200,000 computers, half of which were in the United States. In its first two months, criminals extorted an estimated $27 million from victims. David Hickton, the U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh whose office led the investigation, said in June that Cryptolocker victims included the police department in Swansea, Massachusetts. It paid a ransom to cyber criminals to restore access to its files after its systems were infected. More than 90 people nabbed in global hacker crackdown .

"(CNN) -- A late goal from teenage substitute Divock Origi gave Belgium a hard-fought Group H victory over Russia at a sun-kissed Marcana Stadium Sunday. The 19-year-old striker pounced on Eden Hazard's cut-back to drive the ball high into the net past Igor Akinfeev, sending Marc Wilmots' team into the last 16 of the World Cup with a game to spare. In Sunday's second Group H fixture, Algeria overcame South Korea 4-2 in Porto Alegre for its first World Cup victory since defeating Chile in Spain 1982. The results mean Russia, Algeria and South Korea all still have a chance of progressing to the second phase alongside Belgium, with the final round of matches on Thursday. Belgium 1-0 Russia . In what was largely a tepid and tame match, Belgium controlled much of the possession -- although it was Russia who had the better of the early play and chances. Victor Fayzulan's low drive from the edge of the box was saved by Thibaut Courtois as the sides sized each other up early on. Alexander Kokorin missed a glorious chance for the Russians just before halftime when he headed wide unmarked from only eight yards out. Fabio Capello's men felt they should have had penalty earlier in the half after Maksim Kanunnikov tumbled under the challenge of Tony Alderweireld but the referee adjudged the Russian midfielder to have stumbled over the ball. If the first half was starved of chances, the second half was famished. There was little of note until the last 15 minutes when the Belgians began to press . Kevin Mirallas drilled a free kick from 25 yards low against Akinfeev's right-hand post before Hazard had a shot deflected narrowly wide after displaying some nifty footwork inside the Russian penalty area. But just as a draw seemed likely, the Chelsea star again weaved some magic to set up Origi -- who had come on in the second half to replace the ineffectual Romelu Lukaku. The late strike also marked the first time a teenager has scored at a World Cup since Lionel Messi did so for Argentina against Serbia in 2006. ""It was a highly tactical game,"" a satisfied Wilmots told reporters after the match. ""We were fresher, we were better and that made the difference -- maybe due to our very good fitness preparations."" With qualification now guaranteed, the 45-year-old also hinted at resting players for the final group match against South Korea Thursday. ""We want to be number one in the group but if there are yellow cards or for reasons of freshness I may make a decision,"" said Wilmots, who is Belgium's all-time leading scorer at the World Cup with five goals from the three tournaments he played at from 1994-2002. Capello, meanwhile, lamented what he saw as his side's hard luck in his post match comments. ""The truth of the matter is we had chances to win it but we lost. Both teams gave it their all and unfortunately it was Belgium that was able to make it,"" the Italian said. ""We have to look forward and I said when we came to play in this World Cup after being absent for 12 years that this will be a great help for us to understand the level we need to be at in future competitions."" Algeria 4-2 South Korea . The Desert Foxes picked up their first World Cup victory in 32 years after a three-goal first-half blitz at Estadio Beira-Rio. Man of the match Islam Slimani, defender Rafik Halliche and forward Abdelmoumene Djabou gave the North Africans a convincing lead as they overpowered the 2002 semifinalist. Son Heungmin pulled a goal back for South Korea at the beginning of the second half before Yacine Brahimi -- who switched allegiance from his native France last year -- restored Algeria's advantage with a tidy finish after a one-two with Slimani on the edge of the area. South Korea captain Koo Jacheol then pulled another back with 18 minutes remaining, but Algeria held on for the historic win. Coach Vahid Halilhodzic, who guided Ivory Coast to the last World Cup but was fired before it started, knows his team can reach the second round for the first time by beating Russia on Thursday. Russia can also progress with a win if South Korea fails to defeat Belgium. If Algeria and Russia draw, South Korea can go through by beating Belgium. If Russia and South Korea both win, the Asian side will have to do so by two more goals to overcome its differential deficit.

"PARIS, France (CNN)  -- The French National Assembly announced Tuesday the creation of an inquiry into whether women in France should be allowed to wear the burka, one day after President Nicolas Sarkozy controversially told lawmakers that the traditional Muslim garment was ""not welcome"" in France. A woman wears traditionnal Muslim dress n Venissieux, near Lyon. A cross-party panel of 32 lawmakers will investigate whether the traditional Muslim garment poses a threat to the secular nature of the French constitution. They are due to report back with their recommendations in six months. Last week 57 lawmakers -- led by communist legislator Andre Gerin -- signed a petition calling for a study into the feasibility of legislation to ban the burka in public places. On Monday Sarkozy declared in a keynote parliamentary address that the burka, which covers women from head to toe, is ""not welcome"" in France.  Watch why burkas are such a controversial issue in France » . ""The problem of the burka is not a religious problem. This is an issue of a woman's freedom and dignity. This is not a religious symbol. It is a sign of subservience; it is a sign of lowering. I want to say solemnly, the burka is not welcome in France,"" Sarkozy told lawmakers. The right of Muslim women to cover themselves is fiercely debated in France, which has a large Muslim minority but also a staunchly secular constitution. Should Muslim women in France be banned from wearing the burka? Sound Off below . In 2004, the French parliament passed legislation banning Muslim girls from wearing headscarves in state schools, prompting widespread Muslim protests. The law also banned other conspicuous religious symbols including Sikh turbans, large Christian crucifixes and Jewish skull caps. Last year, France's top court denied a Moroccan woman's naturalization request on the grounds that she wore a burka. Some lawmakers have called for burkas to be banned completely, claiming they are degrading to women. They also include housing minister Fadela Amara, a Muslim-born women's rights campaigner, who has called the garment ""a kind of tomb for women."" ""We cannot accept in our country women trapped behind a fence, cut off from social life, deprived of any identity. This is not the idea that we have of a woman's dignity,"" Sarkozy said Monday. But French Muslim leaders say that only a small minority of women wear the full veil and had previously criticized calls for the issue to be the subject of a parliamentary inquiry. ""To raise the subject like this, via a parliamentary committee, is a way of stigmatizing Islam and the Muslims of France,"" Mohammed Moussaoui, the head of the French Council for the Muslim Religion, told AFP last week. ""We are shocked by the idea parliament should be put to work on such a marginal issue."" According to CIA estimates, between 5 and 10 percent of France's 64 million population are Muslim. The country does not collect its own statistics on religion in accordance with laws enshrining France's status as a secular state. France is not the only European Union country to have considered banning the burka. Dutch lawmakers voted in favor of a ban in 2005, although the government of the time was defeated in elections before it could pass legislation to outlaw the garment.","French lawmakers to consider whether burka threatens French secularism .

"(CNN) -- It's the gaming industry's gold standard, once named by Guinness World Records as the most influential video game in history. Now, Nintendo is turning to ""Super Mario Kart"" once again, hoping the beloved, 22-year-old franchise can save sales of its faltering Wii U console. ""Mario Kart 8"" was released on Friday. It comes at a time when once dominant Nintendo has already slashed its sales forecast for the Wii U down to just 3.6 million for the current fiscal year. By comparison, sales of Sony's PlayStation 4 console, released nearly a year after the Wii U, have already eclipsed the Nintendo's total Wii U sales since its 2012 launch. Among the 5 million Wii U titles sold this fiscal year, ""Super Mario 3D World"" and ""New Super Mario Bros. U"" have been among the most popular, and a new ""Super Smash Bros."" title, featuring Mario alongside other classic video game characters, is due later this year. But ""Mario Kart 8"" might be the Japanese company's best chance for the popular plumber to help the slow-selling console regain its footing. Early results are promising. Nintendo reported the game sold 1.2 million units across Japan, Europe and the Americas during its first weekend. The game's release in the United Kingdom corresponded with a 666% increase in Wii U sales there, according to a British retail tracking company. Nearly 82% of the consoles sold in the UK during that time were part of a bundle deal that included ""Mario Kart 8."" No exact figures were available in the report, from the Association for UK Interactive Entertainment. But it was reportedly the best week of sales yet for a Wii U title and ""Mario Kart 8"" was the nation's second-best selling title behind highly anticipated ""Watch_Dogs,"" which is available for Xbox One, Xbox 360, Playstation 4, PlayStation 3 and Windows PCs (A Wii U version is coming later this year). ""The early response to Mario Kart 8 demonstrates that the best days for Wii U are still ahead,"" said Nintendo of America president and COO Reggie Fils-Aime in a press release. Mario Kart has always been a boon for the console it was released on since ""Super Mario Kart"" hit for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) 22 years ago. ""Mario Kart Wii"" sold more than 35 million copies since its release in 2008. That's more than the total number of Wii U games sold, according to numbers released by Nintendo. Long-time fans are always looking forward to a ""Mario Kart"" game when they get their new device and ""Mario Kart 8"" is no exception. ""Nintendo's developers are always looking for new and interesting elements to bring to a franchise,"" said Marc Franklin, director of public relations for Nintendo of America. ""It's a delicate balance to preserve the feel and integrity of a beloved franchise like 'Mario Kart' while also making it fresh for longtime players."" Since the new title will remain a Wii U exclusive, Nintendo hopes that well-established fan love will push gamers off the fence and get them to buy the new console. Franklin didn't directly answer a question about whether ""Mario Kart"" will boost sales over the long haul, but he sounded upbeat. ""There's no doubt that 'Mario Kart' is one of Nintendo's most enduring franchises, and we're grateful it has been well-received by fans,"" he said. ""As always, it'll be up to fans to decide whether this installment lives up to its pedigree. Based on initial reviews and fan reactions, we're very encouraged."" ""Mario Kart 8"" has drawn mostly positive critical reviews from nearly all corners of the gaming press. Gameplay features were designed to deliver a fan experience that is new, yet true to what players love about the franchise. They include ""anti-gravity"" racing, new weapons (including a Super Horn that finally can deflect the franchise's dreaded blue Spiny Shell), and a high-definition look. The game also includes new racers, karts and courses never seen in previous Mario Kart games, Franklin said. But it could be an uphill struggle. In a pre-release analysis, gaming site Polygon predicted ""Mario Kart 8"" will be the worst selling title in the franchise's history because of the relatively small number of Wii U consoles sold. If all 6.2 million or so Wii U owners bought a copy, it would still be the second-worst selling title. The site projected ""Mario Kart 8"" will sell fewer than 2 million units by next spring, based on past sales vs. the number of consoles that existed for each of those games. Of course, Polygon acknowledges, if the game does indeed spur new console purchases, that number could trend upward -- though probably not enough to match the blockbuster sales of previous ""Kart"" titles. At least publicly, Nintendo remains bullish on its games-first policy and thinks ""Mario Kart 8"" is a big part of it. ""Nintendo is preparing for a very strong first-party software line-up that people really want to try out,"" Nintendo President Satoru Iwata told CNN last June when the company let people try out six new Wii U titles including ""Mario Kart 8."" ""By selling the software, we'd like to expand the hardware sales of the Wii U system. That's our message. Software sells hardware.""","""Mario Kart 8,"" the latest in the popular series, was released Friday .

"(CNN) -- As alumni and friends of Princeton University descended on the Ivy League institution to celebrate homecoming, the school's board of trustees met over the weekend to consider whether to offer students emergency shots of a vaccine against meningitis after seven cases of the potentially fatal disease occurred on campus. The final decision, to be made in concert with medical staff and university administrators, is expected sometime this week, said Barbara Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The sole meningococcal vaccine that targets meningitis group B, Bexsero, is made by Novartis. Though it was approved this year in Europe and Australia, it has not been approved for use in the United States. ""We have filed an Investigational New Drug application for our MenB vaccine in the U.S., but have not yet come to an agreement on a pathway to licensure for this vaccine with regulatory authorities,"" Novartis spokeswoman Elizabeth Power told CNN Saturday in an e-mail. Still, company officials have been coordinating with officials at Princeton, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the state Department of Public Health about getting a vaccine to the school in New Jersey, she said. The CDC says it is considered ""a safe vaccine."" Group B meningitis is a strain of the bacterial form of the disease that is rare in the United States. Symptoms can include stiff neck, headache, fever, vomiting, rashes, sensitivity to light and confusion. Untreated, the disease can lead to complications such as hearing impairment, brain damage, limb amputations and death. Antibiotic treatment of the most common types of bacterial meningitis ""should reduce the risk of dying from meningitis to below 15%, although the risk remains higher among young infants and the elderly,"" according to the CDC. Bacterial meningitis is an infection of the membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord, known as the meninges. In the United States, about 4,100 cases of bacterial meningitis, including 500 deaths, occurred each year between 2003 and 2007, the CDC says. What is meningitis? ""Usually, when you see this kind of meningitis on the campus, it's meningitis C,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, in a telephone interview with CNN. ""This is very, very unusual."" Schaffner added that, in the United States, Group B meningitis typically strikes infants, and only rarely adolescents and young adults. Though the mechanism needed for health officials to administer an unapproved vaccine in the United States is ""very elaborate,"" it would be justified in this case, he said. ""If I were around the table with the board of trustees, I would be gently encouraging them to do this."" Princeton's first reported case developed in a student who had returned to the campus after spring recess in March, according to the state health department. Two months later, after several other students and one visitor had contracted the disease, an outbreak was declared. All have recovered except for the last case, a male student who remains hospitalized after being diagnosed on November 8. No common link has been identified among the cases, New Jersey health officials said. CDC: Bacterial meningitis explainer . Meningitis can spread via the exchange of saliva and other respiratory secretions through kissing, coughing, sharing drinks and living in close quarters, such as in dormitories, according to the health department. The bacteria can reside for months in the back of the throat before causing symptoms, Schaffner said. But the disease is not wholly understood. Cases of meningococcal disease in general -- including Group B -- have dropped in recent years to the lowest levels since the 1930s. ""Nobody knows why,"" he said. And cases sometimes occur more frequently in Oregon. ""We've never understood that, either."" The New Jersey outbreak is also puzzling. ""Why this is occurring is not clear, but the trick everybody is working on is how to stop it, how to prevent further cases,"" he said. If the board approves, as many as 8,000 undergraduate and graduate students at the school could be offered the vaccine. Meningitis vaccines urged before NYC Pride events .

"(CNN) -- At least 19 people were killed and more than 100 were wounded Tuesday in bombings in Iraq, police said. The latest attacks come amid a recent uptick in Sunni-Shiite violence in Iraq that has killed at least 266 people in the past three weeks, according to a CNN tally. The violence has conjured fears that the all-out sectarian conflict that erupted last decade is starting again. A suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest in Tarmiya killed three soldiers and wounded seven others in an attack on a checkpoint. Tarmiya is predominantly Sunni. A car bombing killed five people and wounded 43 others in a Shiite Turkmen neighborhood in Tuz Khurmato. Three roadside bombs at a cattle market in the ethnically mixed city of Kirkuk killed six people and wounded 25 others. On Tuesday evening, five people at a busy outdoor market on the western outskirts of Baghdad were killed by a car bomb. At least 18 others were wounded. A second attack in the predominantly Sunni neighborhood appeared to target an Army patrol. It wounded three soldiers and three civilians. Yet another bomb in southern Baghdad injured four people.

"(CNN) -- The evolution of drones continues. The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory on Thursday announced it successfully launched a drone from a submerged submarine. The technology is being pursued to give sailors additional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance abilities. Some of the funding for the project came from SwampWorks, a program of the Office of Naval Research that focuses on innovative and cutting-edge technologies. ""Developing disruptive technologies and quickly getting them into the hands of our sailors is what our SwampWorks program is all about,"" said Craig A. Hughes, acting director of innovation at Office of Naval Research. ""This demonstration really underpins ONR's dedication and ability to address emerging fleet priorities."" Your personal $849 underwater 'drone' The drone, or unmanned aerial system, was launched from a torpedo tube on the USS Providence, the Navy said in a news release. The drone itself was inside a launch vehicle called the Sea Robin that fit inside the torpedo tube. Once launched, the Sea Robin made its way to the ocean surface and, upon command, the drone itself launched from there, the Navy said. The drone, powered with electric fuel cells, then flew for hours, streaming live video back to Navy officials. Unlike other projects that can take decades to produce results, the technology to launch a drone from a submerged submarine took just six years from concept to demonstration, the Navy said. ""This six-year effort represents the best in collaboration of a Navy laboratory and industry to produce a technology that meets the needs of the special operations community,"" said Warren Schultz, program developer and manager at the Naval Research Laboratory.
