"A council has been slammed as 'woefully inadequate' and ordered to pay a legal bill of more than £80,00 after its social workers snatched a dementia-sufferer from her house while her son was out. The 81-year-old woman was removed after a manager at a daycare centre she visited raised concerns about bruises and scratches on her face and legs. It took the son 19 days to get Milton Keynes Council to tell him where they had taken her. Taking on the council in the Court of Protection he racked up huge legal fees - which he claimed were a 'direct consequence' of the council's 'actions and omissions'. District Judge Paul Mort described Milton Keynes Council's treatment of the 81-year-old woman, a former magistrate with severe dementia, as 'woefully inadequate' At the Court of Protection, District Judge Paul Mort today ruled that the local authority must foot the bill. Back in May he described Milton Keynes Council’s treatment of the pensioner, a former magistrate with severe dementia, as ‘woefully inadequate’. In today's judgment, published on a legal website, he said that the council had set a 'juggernaut in motion' when it initially failed to investigate - and concluded that an 'award of costs' was 'manifestly justified'. The judge did not identify the woman but named Milton Keynes Council as the local authority with responsibility for her welfare. In September 2012 the manager of a care centre the woman attended had raised concerns about bruises and scratches on her face and legs. A month later, a visiting student social worker saw more injuries and alerted her bosses. The council’s social services staff removed the woman and put her in a care home as they thought she may have been abused by her son, who lived with her. But their own inquiries and a subsequent police investigation found no evidence. The details emerged in a ruling made by the judge at the Court of Protection, based at The Royal Courts of Justice in The Strand, London, which deals with cases involving sick and vulnerable people . Judge Mort said the manner in which the social services removed the woman without getting the correct court orders violated her human rights, and described it as ‘unlawful detainment’. He also said she now has little prospect of being able to return to her home. The judge said the woman had lived at her house for 32 years and was rooted in her local community. Her son sold his business abroad so he and his partner, along with a care worker he employed, could look after her. Earlier in the year, he described to The Mail on Sunday in May how he returned home to find his mother gone. He said: ‘The care worker said to me, “The council have taken her to a place of safety.” ‘I thought you need a warrant to enter someone’s house, but they just came and took her away.’ He said he was eventually given access to his mother at the care home, but under severe restrictions. ‘I was only allowed to visit her in the afternoons, and a staff member sat with us,’ he said. Judge Mort lifted council restrictions that prevented the son from seeing his mother without being monitored by social workers. He can now see her as many times as he likes and take her out.","Milton Keynes Council did not tell son where his mother was for 19 days .

"The eight-year-old daughter of a Newark politician is in a critical condition after she was attacked by a pit bull in her home. Emily Ruckle was bitten multiple times by the pit bull and suffered severe soft-tissue injuries and blood loss from the attack,  in Stafford neighborhood on Saturday afternoon. The child, whose father is city Councilman Todd Ruckle, was with her 15-year-old sister when the dog became aggressive. The animal prevented the two girls, who were home alone, from leaving the room where the attack occurred. Scroll down for video . Emily Ruckle was bitten multiple times by the pit bull and suffered severe soft-tissue injuries and blood loss from the attack, in Stafford neighborhood on Saturday afternoon . The child, whose father is city Councilman Todd Ruckle (pictured) suffered 'severe soft tissue injuries and bleeding from multiple dog bites' after the incident in Stafford neighborhood on Saturday afternoon . The girl's sister called the emergency services and stemmed the bleeding until paramedics arrived. When officers arrived they shot the dog dead. New Castle County paramedics took the girl  to Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in Rockland. She was then flown to Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania, where she was listed in critical condition. 'Today is the hardest day of my life. My daughter is alive and will survive,' Todd Ruckle posted on his Facebook page, reports the Delaware Online. 'She has 4 to 6 hours of surgery with three different teams of surgeons. The child was with her 15-year-old sister when the dog became aggressive - the animal prevented the two girls, who were home alone, from leaving the room where the attack occurred . Emily's sister called police and provided medical assistance to her little sister while they waited for paramedics to arrive . 'We are praying we can save her arm. I am truly in need of love and support. Please send every ounce of positive thoughts right now.' Jerry Clifton, a longtime family friend told the website the dog was not the family pet, but was staying at the house. 'She's such a friendly girl. She loves animals and my heart goes out to her family and I feel awful,' said Dee Wagman, family friend told 6ABC. She said her children would often play at the Ruckle's home, but they 'would ensure me that the dog was locked separately and they would have no contact with that dog,' she said. Yesterday the family spokesman issued a statement saying: 'The Ruckle family would like to thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers, but have asked that the media and public respect their privacy during this difficult time.' The reason for the dog's attack is unclear.","Emily Ruckle was attacked when she was at home in Stafford neighborhood .

"He was discovered by Andy Warhol at 17, has photographed everyone from Angelina Jolie to Michael Jackson and even our very own golden girl Kylie Minogue, and now he's Down Under. Acclaimed photographer David LaChapelle, who famously shot the Kardashian Christmas card last year, was in Sydney this week to take part in a new campaign which aims to get people to connect with the environment around them. In a series of photographs shot over two days, the artist swapped his camera for his smartphone and presented his take on the Land Down Under - to be displayed in an online photo gallery. World famous photographer David LaChapelle is in Australia for the #MySecretOz campaign with American Express. Pictured here is a paddleboarder enjoying the sunset at Darling Point . In a series of photographs shot over two days, the artist swapped his camera for his smartphone and presented his take on the Land Down Under, like this shot at Seven Shillings Beach . American Express have brought LaChapelle to Australia as part of their #MySecretOz campaign, which urges commuters to get away from the 'urban auto-pilot' and instead get Sydneysiders to see their spectacular city in a new light. From the bright lights of Luna Park, the glittering seas at Seven Shillings Beach and a spectacular sunset over the city skyline LaChapelle explored Sydney in a new and spectacular light. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia shortly after he touched down in Sydney, the photographer said he couldn't wait to spend time in the 'unique' 'mixed city'. The bright lights of Sydney's Luna Park will also feature in the online photo gallery, launched on October 21 . LaChapelle captured this action shot of a man making his way through a tunnel in Coney Island in Luna Park . The spectacular views from the cliff-tops of North Head impressed the famous photographer, who told Daily Mail Australia he planned on visiting the site . LaChapelle is Kanye West's favourite photographer and has shot nearly every celebrity inside and outside of Hollywood . 'I can't get over the architecture and I love the fact it's not so hectic like LA with the traffic. '(And) I'm really amazed - I didn't even know about the beaches,' LaChapelle said speaking of the close proximity of the seaside to the city. The photographer revealed he didn't really have a plan for what he was going to shoot, but rather would go exploring and see what caught his eye. 'It's good, it's a challenge - I often think things out a lot before I do them,' adding he was looking forward to 'coming here totally fresh and not knowing much.' When asked about sites that had taken his fancy so far, LaChapelle said a certain spot at the other end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge caught his eye. 'I love Luna Park, I just saw it for the first time ... I thought it was one of the most amazing things'. 'There's a few (other) places on my list that I just want to check out, and one of them is the North Head cliffs, they're dramatic and beautiful', LaChapelle said. Being one of the greatest influences in pop culture over the past few decades, the photographer took on the epitome last year when he took the Kardashian's Christmas photo at the end of last year. 'It was a real lesson in modern anthropology', he said. LaChapelle added that shooting the famous family was 'a real reflection of where we are as a society today.' 'The idea in my head was this future Las Vegas Mall and the casinos, and in America we have all these malls that are failing and losing a lot of money. 'It's the apocalyptic idea,' LaChapelle revealed. 'There were 600 million comments worldwide about that photograph.' As for the MySecretOz campaign, its all about getting people to stop and smell the roses. 'MySecretOz is about encouraging people to reconnect with the beauty that surrounds us every day, American Express Australia Managing Director, Rachel Stocks said . He shot this post-apocalyptic Christmas card for the Kardashian family in 2013 and described the experience as 'a real lesson in modern anthropology' This intricate tree in Nielsen Park, Vaucluse, captured the eye of the photographer who was armed with nothing but a smartphone for the shoot . 'In an increasingly fast-paced world we often end up stuck on ‘autopilot’, failing to take notice of the inspiring places and moments in our day-to-day environment. MySecretOz will serve as a visual reminder that the world is full of vibrant experiences worthy of our attention.' LaChapelle’s MySecretOz gallery will launch on the American Express Facebook page on Tuesday 21st October 2014. Social media users can snap their own photographs of the stunning seaside city of Sydney and share them with the hashtag #MySecretOz over the course of the next month which could end up in the crowd-sourced online gallery.

"It all started as a simple garden fence dispute, but a row between two billionaires on a paradise island has since spiralled to include accusations of arson, racism and high-level corruption. Now the decade-long feud between New York hedge-fund manager Louis Bacon and Canadian clothing tycoon Peter Nygard is coming to a head once again. Mr Bacon has just won permission to access to a trove of 1,000 hours of video footage which he claims will show Mr Nygard orchestrated a smear-campaign against him. Louis Bacon (left) a billionaire hedge-fund manager, has won access to 1,000 hours of video footage he claims will show a smear campaign against him by clothing magnate Peter Nygard (right) The pair are neighbours in the luxury community of Lyford Cray, located on New Providence Island on the Bahamas and have been locked in a decade-long legal dispute over property boundaries . Lawyers for Mr Bacon say the collection includes films with titles such as 'Is Louis Bacon a Racist?' and 'Is Louis Bacon a Murderer?,' according to court papers. The new accusations are just the latest round of a long-running spat between the pair that has torn the idyllic New Providence Island in the Bahamas apart. Nygard, a self-styled playboy and eccentric owner of Nygard International, has an estimated fortune just shy of $1billion, and has lived in the exclusive Lyford Cay community on the island since 1987. His famous 150,000-square-foot beachfront mansion, dubbed 'Nygard Cay', is designed in the style of a Mayan temple, and featured a 32,000-square-foot grand hall with a 100,000lb glass ceiling. Previous visitors to the complex have included George W Bush and Robert De Niro. Bacon, meanwhile, is the founder of Moore Capital Management LLC, has an estimated wealth of $1.6billion, and has lived next door to Nygard since 1996. The feud between the two began around 2004 when a group of conservationists, including Bacon, established the Coalition to Protect Clifton Bay to preserve the Western part of the island, where Nygard lives. The group accused Nygard of illegally dredging the sea bed, extending the island's natural shore line, and of expanding the borders of his compound without proper permission. They attempted to block any further attempts by Nygard to expand his home buy buying up a large stretch of coast line and establishing a nature reserve. The Canadian hit back with a series of videos in which he claimed to be a friend of the Bahamas and passionate about the conserving the islands. Nygard has lived on the islands since 1987, and owns a Mayan-themed mansion complex which was partly destroyed by a fire in 2009 - which he accuses Bacon of starting . Nygard founded clothing producer Nygard International and is known as a playboy-eccentric. In the past he has accused Bacon of hiding the fact that his great-grandfather belonged to the KKK . Nygard also accused Bacon of trying to hide the fact that his great-grandfather, Col. Roger B. Moore, was a member of the Ku Klux Klan as well as a former officer in the Confederate Army. Bacon claims this amounts to character assassination, and says Nygard is behind rallies and protest marches on the island which have seen him denounced as a racist. The bitter argument came to a dramatic head in 2009 when a fire gutted Nygard's mansion. Fire crews listed the official cause as 'unknown', but Nygard firmly believes it was an act of arson organised by Bacon - a claim he strongly denies. Nygard also claimed that Bacon installed four 'large, military-grade' speakers at the boundary between their two properties, before aiming them at his bedroom. Bacon then blared 'ear piercing noises' toward Nygard, with one of Bacon's assistants shouting 'There, that's a message from Mr. Bacon. Don't f*** with Louis,' according to court papers. Since the fire destroyed large parts of his home, Nygard has applied for planning permission to rebuild the lavish estate in even grander style, prompting outrage from the exclusive community. Earlier this year, more than 100 people, including actor Sean Connery and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, filed a legal complaint against the government over efforts by Mr Nygard to redevelop his compound. Now a judge has approved access to video tapes which Bacon's legal team say will prove Nygard organised a smear campaign against him. Louis Bacon is worth an estimated $1.6billion and is a New York hedge-fund manager and founder of Moore Capital Management LLC. He has accused Nygard of organising protests denouncing him as a racist . In another bizarre allegation, Nygard claims Bacon set up for 'military-grade' speakers along the edge of his property, before aiming them into his bedroom and playing 'ear piercing' noises . Separately this week, Bacon's lawyers also accused Nygard of trying to bribe Bahamian officials into granting planning permission for new developments to his home . The accusations centre around minutes of a meeting with Prime Minister Perry Christie, in which the government appears to agree to $50million-worth of redevelopment, as long as Nygard builds astem-cell research facility on his property, reports the New York Post. Bacon's legal time argue that minutes of a meeting with Prime Minister Perry Christie - in which the deal was agreed - could be fabricated, or were at least disclosed illegally. The New York Post reports that Nygard denies trying to influence the government, and likewise denies that he has orchestrated a smear campaign against Bacon. According to Nygard's lawyer, the billionaire has been supporting  an 'education campaign' mounted by a local group to expose Bacon’s alleged racism. A spokesman for Nygard added that the latest legal action is another attempt to prevent him from rebuilding his home.","Louis Bacon and Peter Nygard have been involved in decade-long legal spat .

"Cover-up: Former Archbishop Lord Hope allowed a paedophile priest to escape punishment for sex crimes, a judge's report claims . A former archbishop who failed to act on alleged crimes of a paedophile priest should be jailed, the abuser’s victims have said. Lord Hope, the former Archbishop of York, did not act on 19 occasions when allegations of abuse or inappropriate conduct by the priest were raised with him, a scathing report revealed yesterday. But despite that, Lord Hope remains as an honorary assistant bishop in the Diocese of Bradford. Eli Ward and Bim Atkinson, who were among seven victims of the Very Reverend Robert Waddington, former Dean of Manchester, said it is ‘incredible’ that the man who did nothing to stop the priest has been allowed to keep his post. The report by Judge Sally Cahill QC said Lord Hope failed to act because his ‘concern for the welfare of Robert Waddington seems to have been paramount’. Waddington, who kept an official position in the church until 2005 and died in 2007, targeted young choirboys over several decades. One of the seven victims committed suicide in 1989. Mr Atkinson, 59, who was abused when Waddington was a priest in Australia in the 1960s, sent a picture of disgraced Tory peer Lord Archer, who was jailed for perjury, to the Bishop of North Queensland Bill Ray, adding: ‘I would be pushing for Lord Hope to be treated in the same way as this fellow.’ Mr Ward, now 41, was abused by Waddington between the ages of 11 and 15 as a chorister at Manchester Cathedral. He said: ‘It’s just incredible Lord Hope still has a position. Here is a guy who shoved it all under the carpet. 'He failed and failed to do anything and yet nothing has happened to him. He is still allowed to sit in the House of Lords.’ He added: ‘I’d like to see him punished. My opinion is that he’s committed a crime, perverting the course of justice, and should face the consequences.’ Robert Waddington died in 2007 - he had been accused of abusing seven different victims between 1955 and 1996 . Mr Ward said he left the choir when he was 15 after church officials became concerned – but the priest was allowed to remain as the dean in charge of the cathedral until 1993. Waddington then moved to York Minster, where more children were abused. He stayed in a lesser post there until 2005, despite the allegations made to Lord Hope, according to the report, which was commissioned by current Archbishop of York, the Most Reverend John Sentamu. Mr Ward said: ‘Here we had a church body which had been preaching at us to be morally correct yet, when it came to doing the same thing themselves, they were incapable.’ Mr Ward, now living in the Home Counties with a long-term girlfriend, added that he has put the abuse behind him. But he believes Waddington’s abuse was responsible for the death of another victim, a former chorister from Carlisle named in the report only as Peter, who was abused in the 1970s, developed depression and schizophrenia, and committed suicide in 1989. Lord Hope, 76, has described Judge Cahill’s report as ‘flawed’ but offered a ‘personal and profound apology’. He said: ‘This report makes it clear that not applying the policy is not the same as a cover-up. Hindsight is a wonderful thing.’","Very Reverend Robert Waddington sexually abused choirboys for decades .

"A police officer who became an internet hit when he smashed a  pensioner’s car window with his baton has been awarded £440,000 in compensation after claiming he was ridiculed out of his job. PC Mike Baillon, 47, walked out saying that he had become a laughing stock among colleagues. Footage of him hitting the disabled man’s vehicle 15 times was leaked on YouTube, where it became a global sensation. Scroll down for video . Former PC Mike Baillon was awarded  £430,000 at a Cardiff hearing yesterday. He says he had to leave Gwent Police over ridicule from this video of him attacking a Range Rover . PC Mike Baillon, pictured left, complained he had become a 'laughing stock' over a YouTube video of him using a truncheon to smash into a pensioner's car. The . taxpayer-funded cash for constructive dismissal is the equivalent of 12 . years’ salary for a PC on the highest pay grade and does not include . legal costs. Critics will say it highlights an out-of-control . compensation culture in policing. In . comparison, the 74-year-old man whose Range Rover was wrecked was given . just £20,000. Robert Whatley said last night: ‘It’s totally . unreasonable behaviour rewarded by a totally unreasonable pay-out. ‘PC Baillon’s behaviour was terrible to start with – but it is even worse that he has been given so much money.’ PC . Baillon was one of two officers who  pursued retired businessman Mr . Whatley along country roads near Usk, South Wales, in 2009. The stroke . victim was stopped for not wearing a seatbelt and drove away before . officers finished speaking to him. They chased him for 17 minutes, then . pulled over his £60,000 black car again. Mr . Whatley said he expected a knock on his window but instead PC Baillon . attacked it with a metal baton while his colleague jumped on the bonnet . and kicked through the windscreen. The police car’s dashboard camera . showed PC Baillon running up to the driver’s door and smashing the . window. The officers were . cleared of misconduct after an internal inquiry, but PC Baillon was . removed from frontline duties because his mental state could have . affected him in high-speed chases, a tribunal heard. The Cardiff employment tribunal was told colleagues often brought up what became known as the ‘Whatley incident’. Once, after police had to smash a suspect’s door down, a colleague told him: ‘It wasn’t a window.’ Mr . Baillon told the tribunal his locker was defaced and he became a . ‘laughing stock’ before taking sick leave and complaining to Gwent . Police Authority. The former . traffic officer said: ‘Ridicule from colleagues was getting to me – it . was every single day. They thought I had done wrong and I was lucky to . have got away with it. I just wanted my closure.’ The . tribunal heard he could have won £750,000 from his seven claims, . including personal injury, injury to feelings and aggravating damages, . but only one was upheld. Mr . Baillon, who has since set up a business selling wooden reindeer, was . awarded almost £440,000 for loss of pension and earnings. The tax-free . payment is the equivalent of 12 years’ salary for a PC on the highest . basic pay of £36,519. His . solicitor criticised the Gwent force for ‘removing him from the job he . loved’ in a ‘gross abuse of power’. Nick Smith said he ‘hung on for grim . death’ but finally ‘snapped’ and quit. Incident: Driver Robert Whatley claimed Mr Baillon and his colleague - who jumped on the bonnet and smashed the windscreen - went over the top . Held: Robert Clive Whatley was questioned by police after being taken out of the car during the two-minute stop recorded by the officers' car's on-board camera. Damage: Mr Whatley was ordered to pay £235 after being found guilty of speeding and failing to stop for police - but received compensation for the damage to his Range Rover inflicted by Mr Baillon and his unnamed colleague . He . added: ‘We’re talking about  a man who would have made  sergeant. This . was a man who had been wounded to his core by how he had been treated by . his employers. What has made that worse is the disingenuous way the . force has defended their actions.’ Robert Clive Whatley from Usk, South Wales. His Range Rover was smashed by Baillon . Mr . Baillon, who served with Gwent for 16 years, said: ‘I would rather be . driving police cars but I couldn’t accept the treatment.’ Mr . Whatley was awarded £20,000 for the damage to his Range Rover, and . ordered to pay £235 for speeding and failing to stop for police. The . payment is the latest huge police compensation claim. One Suffolk . officer received more than £13,000 after hurting his big toe during . safety training. Norfolk PC . Kelly Jones threatened to sue a garage owner after tripping over a kerb, . but dropped her claim after a national outcry. Home . Secretary Theresa May has criticised ‘frivolous’ claims which she has . said do not show ‘the sort of attitude’ officers should have. But Tory MP David Davies, whose Monmouth constituency covers the scene of the incident, said that senior officers were to blame. He . said: ‘I don’t like to see big pay-outs of this kind, I think the whole . thing should have been dealt with better by the police force. ‘There’s . no doubt in my mind PC Baillon was unfairly treated and he should have . been exonerated quicker. He was a good police officer and it was a shame . he had to leave his job. ‘He was chasing after a vehicle which had refused to stop and he had every reason to think this  was suspicious.’ Gwent Police said in a statement that it was disappointed with the outcome of the case. Conservative MP David Davies criticised the size of the compensation payout received by Mr Baillon, but said it was the fault of the force, not the former officer. The Tory politician said police chiefs were to blame for not dealing with his case quicker to stop the workplace taunts by other officers. Mr Davies, whose rural Monmouth constituency covers the scene, has been in touch with Mr Baillon since the truncheon attack on the Range Rover. He said: 'I don't like to see big payouts of this kind, I think the whole thing should have been dealt with better by the police force. 'It should have been dealt with more quickly - it was very clear he was under great stress but his case took ages to be looked at. 'There's no doubt in my mind Pc Mike Baillon was unfairly treated and he should have been exonerated quicker. 'He was a good police officer and it was a shame he had to leave his job. 'There is a tendency in the police to rib people, but his colleagues were making a mistake when they made fun of him.

"Dan Davidson was nicknamed the 'fat one' during his party years when he would knock back a bottle of vodka in a weekend. The 26-year-old joiner would easily consume 6,000 calories in a day, while eating nothing but fast food and his weight shot up to 17st. He knew things had to change when he went on holiday to Majorca and was too embarrassed to take off his top when he went swimming. Scroll down for video . Dan Davidson from Grimsby went on a drastic fitness programme after being labelled The Fat One. He lost 24 per cent of his body fat in just a year and celebrated with a David-Beckham style underwear photoshoot . To make matters worse, his girlfriend Rachel Brown, 30, was a  gym instructor with a toned physique. Dan, from Grimsby, knew that the only way to match Rachel's figure was by completely transforming his life. He gave up his alcohol binges and went from being overweight to a body builder in just over a year. The father-of-two said: 'I still cannot believe how I have changed. 'The key for me was giving up the booze, if I was on the lash, I would be eating all of the wrong things and bingeing on fast food. 'I could easily get through 6,000 calories in a day and would drink a bottle of vodka over a weekend. Dan Davidson went from 17st to 14st with a vigorous gym routine and strict diet . 'I was still going to the gym during this time but it was making no difference to my body shape. 'I had man boobs and hated the way I looked. 'The low point for me was when a lass pointed at me and said I was, 'the fat one.'' That was the trigger which prompted Dan to get serious about fitness. He changed his diet - swapping his favourite Coco Pops and takeaways for a high protein diet of grilled chicken and fish. Dave combined his new diet and exercise with protein shakes to help bulk up muscle . He also started taking Forza T5s - the supplements which helped Made In Chelsea star Spencer Matthews lose two stone  to get in shape for his Men's Health magazine cover. Over the next year, Dan lost four stone - going from 17st to  13st. His 'vodka belly' disappeared quickly as he lost six inches from his waist - down from 36in to 30in. But the biggest change was in his body fat ratio - which went down from 30 per cent to 6 per cent. After finally felt confident about his body, Dan bought a studio photoshoot where he posed in his underwear like David Beckham. Dan's body transformation means that he finally feels comfortable alongside his gym instructor girlfriend Rachel Brown . He said: 'I loved posing for the pictures. A few people have joked that I look like Becks in his kecks. 'I have worked so hard to get the body of my dreams and I don't see why I shouldn't celebrate that success.' Dan said taking the supplements had really helped him to lose weight. He explained: 'They were the key to losing a lot of that fat including my man boobs. They really help you to burn calories more effectively by speeding up your metabolism.' 7am breakfast: Bowl of Coco pops with full fat milk . 12.30pm lunch: Cheese panini with chips . 3pm afternoon snack: Tea and biscuits . 5.30pm evening meal: Pasta bake with a chocolate mousse. 8pm further snacks: sweets . 7am breakfast: Scrambled eggs with six egg whites, plus 40g porridge with wholegrain oats . 10am: 150g turkey breast with spinach. 12.30pm lunch: chicken and sweet potato . 3pm snack: 150g of skinless haddock . 5.30pm evening meal - chicken breast and brown rice . 7pm – Forza Lipowhey protein shake . Now Dan is knowledgeable enough to swap diet and exercise tips with girlfriend Rachel - mother of his children Noah, four, and 18-month-old Freya. He said: 'I have learned so much from her about diet and fitness and now we are both in great shape. I couldn't have done this without her.'

"Lionel Messi, Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta... household names who will be hoping to fly the Argentine flag high and proud in Brazil. Javier Mascherano and Angel Di Maria will also have crossed the radar of anyone with the vaguest interest in Spain’s El Clasico. But not all of coach Alejandro Sabella’s squad are quite as high profile. Here is Sportsmail's pocket guide to Argentina 2014. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lionel Messi, Sergio Aguero and other Argentinian stars train . Preparations: Lionel Messi (second right) and Co will be desperate to win the World Cup in Brazil this year . Sergio Romero (Sampdoria) Age: 27. Has been on loan at Monaco. The 6ft 4ins keeper has two taller brothers, who are basketball players. Won a Dutch League title with AZ Alkmaar and helped Sampdoria get promoted to Serie A. First-choice Argentina keeper for several years – played in 2010 World Cup. Pablo Zabaleta (Man City) Age: 29. Needs no introduction to Barclays Premier League followers. The right back is a no-nonsense defender who can switch instantly into an attack threat. Great vision, great crossing ability and a veteran member of the Argentine national squad. Ezequiel Garay (Benfica) Age: 27. First World Cup for a central defender with an eye for a goal. Moved to Benfica in 2011 after only a handful of appearances at Real Madrid, where a certain Jose Mourinho wasn’t convinced. Garay arrived for £4.5m as Fabio Coentrao moved in the opposite direction for ten times as much. All smiles: Defender Pablo Zabaleta (left) shares a joke with Lionel Messi during Argentina training last month . Federico Fernandez (Napoli) Age: 25. Central defender who has been labelled the ‘weakest link’ by regular Argentina watchers. A year ago seemed to be on his way out of Napoli but played 32 times for Rafa Benitez in a Serie A team which won the Coppa Italia and finished third in Serie A. Marcos Rojo (Sporting Lisbon) Age: 24. Left back who has caught the eye of scouts all over Europe this season. Favoured by Argentine coach Alejandro Sabella since overcoming a dodgy season at Spartak Moscow two years ago. Javier Mascherano (Barcelona) Age: 30. Another familiar name to Premier League fans. Formerly of West Ham and Liverpool and, since 2010, a stalwart of Barcelona. Vastly experienced, can drop into defence, break up play, and spark counter-attacks. So, not bad then. Back of the net: Javier Mascherano (right) is congratulated by Ezequiel Lavezzi after scoring in June . Fernando Gago (Boca Juniors) Age: 28. Playing his first World Cup after missing out on 2006 and 2010. Defensive midfielder whose Real Madrid career was ultimately blighted by injury which led to moves to Roma and Valencia before going back to where it all started with Boca. Also married to tennis player Gisella Dulko. Angel Di Maria (Real Madrid) Age: 26. Man of the match in the Champions League final, on a night when he was the only Real Madrid player to shine throughout. Can play as midfielder, out wide, up front – anywhere he does not have to tackle. Widely tipped to be on his way out when Gareth Bale arrived last summer, Di Maria has reacted on the pitch. Verstaile: Talented Angel di Maria (centre) can play as a midfielder, out wide or up front . Lionel Messi (Barcelona) Age: 26. Extraordinary as this may sound, but the magical little Leo has still to convince many in Argentina. Often accused of failing to take his club form on the international stage (sound familiar, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Steve McManaman?). Had injury problems last season but has the key to unlock any door. Sergio Aguero (Man City) Age: 26. A question mark over the striker’s fitness remains after a season of thigh strains but he still managed 28 goals. Fabulous forward with the golden ability to score from nothing. Deadly duo: Close pals Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero will be hoping to fire Argentina to World Cup glory . Gonzalo Higuain (Napoli) Age 26. Probably . going to be the forward prong behind whom Messi, Di Maria and Aguero . will support. Higuain scored 17 goals in his first Serie A season after . leaving Real Madrid and managed four in five Champions League fixtures . before Napoli dropped into the Europa League. He has a better World Cup . record than Messi, too – four in four in South Africa. And don’t forget... Martin Demichelis (Man City) Age: 33. A surprise package in this squad, much like he has been at City. When Manuel Pellegrini tempted his former Malaga defender out of Spain last year eyebrows were raised. Clangers plus a red card against Barcelona did little to stop the scoffing but Demichelis stuck in there and began to show real quality. So much so, that he is back in the national squad after three years, axed because of a mistake against Bolivia. Maxi Rodriguez (Newell Old Boys) Age: 33. Still going strong two years after leaving Liverpool. Oozes class, the midfielder/winger can be an impact player from the bench. Ezequiel Lavezzi (Paris SG) Age: 29. One of the hottest properties around two years ago when he was scoring goals for fun with Napoli, leaving to his big move to France. The striker was a shock absentee from the World Cup squad four years ago and is down the pecking order now but has the capacity to trouble defences.

"From road accidents to military attacks, it is thought that a third of people who survive a terrifying experience have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There is now hope that in the future, a simple pill or nasal spray containing a natural stress-relieving chemical, called neuropeptide Y (NPY), could help survivors recover from stress faster and become less fearful and anxious. The drug could also be used to make soldiers more resilient in battle situations, experts say. A simple pill or nasal spray containing a natural stress-relieving chemical, could once day help PTSD survivors recover from stress faster and become less fearful and anxious. The drug could also be used to make soldiers more resistant in battle situations, experts say. A stock image of a soldier under stress is pictured . Scientists from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut and the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, are studying the effects of acute stress on the human body at the US army’s ‘survival school’ called Camp Mackall in North Carolina. There, soldiers are subjected to mock interrogations and other scary situations, Gizmodo reported. Professors Dennis Charney and Steven Southwick tested soldiers before and after the mock interrogations and discovered that a chemical called neuropeptide Y (NPY) was produced in the brain when they coped with extreme stress. Scientists are testing the effects of  stress on soldiers who undergo mock interrogations (illustrated with a stock image) at ‘survival school’ Soldiers with higher levels of NPY coped better under pressure. And overall, all of the special forces troops, who are known for working in particularly stressful environments, had more of the chemical than regular soldiers. The chemical is triggered by stress and helps to repress the release of noradrenaline – a hormone that is involved in the flight-or-fight response. The scientists think that higher levels of NPY enable people to recover from stress faster and help them be more resilient under pressure. Animal tests have revealed that doses of the chemical can reduce fear and anxiety, while genetic studies suggest that people with a form of NPY gene are less prone to worrying. Professor Charney believes that by understanding the role of NPY better, experts could unlock the secret of resilience. His team has developed an NPY nasal spray to give PTSD patients a low dose of the drug, having gained permission from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in spring to test it on people. While he said that a low dose does not appear to produce any noticeable benefits, the team is now giving PTSD sufferers higher doses and hopes to be able to share their its findings by next spring. The scientists have high hopes because a study on mice in 2013 showed that seven days after the animals were put through a traumatic experience, they were given a high dose of NPY and showed fewer signs of depression and anxiety afterwards than untreated mice. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety caused by very stressful or frightening events. They may include military combat, terrorist attacks, assault, natural disasters, road accidents or witnessing violent deaths. PTSD can develop immediately after a disturbing event, or can emerge months or years later. It's thought that one in three people who have a traumatic experience are affected by PTSD, NHS Choices say. Sufferers often relive the event through nightmares or flashbacks and can feel isolated, frightened or guilty. Symptoms, including difficulty sleeping, can be persistent and severe enough to impact on a person's day-to-day life. PTSD is currently treated with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) as well as antidepressant medication.","A pill or nasal spray could help treat post-traumatic stress disorder in future .

"A shameless family of benefits cheats was jailed today for swindling £90,000 using copycat lies about their love lives. Parents Alison and Jason Parfitt pocketed public money for years by pretending their marriage had hit the rocks. The pair were wrongly paid benefits as single people - despite still living together normally as man and wife. And a court heard that their two children milked the system in the same way. Daughter Gemma Parfitt, 27, falsely claimed benefits for living alone and lied that she did not knowing the identity of her own baby's father. And the couple's son Stuart Parfitt, 29, pretended he was a single bachelor while living with his girlfriend. Alison (pictured) and Jason Parfitt were wrongly paid benefits as single people, despite living together as man and wife. She was jailed for eight months after fraudulently claiming £26,000 in income support, housing benefit and council tax benefits. Jason admitted three charges of fraud and was jailed for seven months . A judge said he was horrified that Mrs and Mrs Parfitt even denied the existence of their own grandchildren in a bid to carry on claiming benefits. Father-of-two Jason Parfitt, 47, was working for the Probation Service while he was dishonestly claiming benefits. Fraud investigators raided all three of the Parfitt's homes after an anonymous tip off and found 'all the trappings of normal family life'. There were birthday cards, joint bank statements and even their dirty washing was used as evidence that the couples were 'happily co-habiting'. Investigators also checked the family Facebook pages which confirmed they were couples living together. Pictured left, Stuart Parfitt, pretended he was single while living with his girlfriend, and was given a four-month suspended jail sentence after admitting one charge of fraudulently claiming more than £28,000. Right, Gemma Parfitt, who claimed she lived alone and didn't know the identity of her baby's father, was jailed for seven months after admitting six charges of fraud amounting to £38,000 . Prosecutor Andrew Morse said: 'These cases are intrinsically linked - Alison and Jason Parfitt claimed benefits on the basis they were single. 'But between 2006 and 2009, Jason Parfitt was in full employment and living with his wife. 'Their daughter Gemma was getting income support and tax benefits on the basis she was single. 'But she was living with her partner who was in full employment. 'Their son Stuart received benefits after saying he was single but he was living with his partner and their baby.' Cardiff Crown Court heard Alison Parfitt, 48, was an appointee for her daughter's benefits while Jason was the appointee for their son. It meant the benefit payments were paid into the parents' accounts and then handed out to the children. Gemma Parfitt's partner Wayne Rees (pictured) admitted one charge of fraud and was given a community order . When the benefits agency became suspicious, Mrs Parfitt denied the existence of her grandson Harley - the child of Gemma and her partner Wayne Rees, 26. Gemma claimed Rees was just a friend and she was not romantically involved with him. But checks showed Rees took paternity leave from work at the exact time their son was born. The Parfitts all lived within a few miles of each other in Tredegar, South Wales. Alison Parfitt was jailed for eight months after admitting seven charges of fraud by dishonestly claiming £26,000 in income support, housing benefit and council tax benefits. She also admitted fraudulently receiving a further £26,000 by supporting her daughter's claims for benefits. Jason Parfitt admitted three charges of benefit fraud including supporting his son's benefits claims. He was jailed for seven months. Judge Jonathan Furness told him: 'You have been a party to the fraud in respect of your wife and son.' Pregnant Gemma Parfitt sobbed as she was jailed for seven months after admitting six charges of fraud amounting to £38,000. Her partner garage worker Rees admitted one charge of fraud and was given a community order. Stuart Parfitt admitted one charge of fraudently claiming more than £28,000 and was given a four-month suspended jail sentence. Parfitt told the court he wanted to be jailed like the rest of his family but the judge refused his request. After the case, a spokeswoman for the Department of Work and Pensions said the Parfitts had swindled a total of £90,700 of public money between them.","Parents Alison and Jason Parfitt, from Tredegar, South Wales, were wrongly paid benefits as single people despite living together as man and wife .

"Vice President Joe Biden is now expected to apologize to Saudi officials for comments he made on Friday accusing the Arab nation of providing funding and arms to extremists in Syria. The New York Times reports that Biden is in the process of contacting Saudi leaders to formally clarify that he does not believe the U.S. ally purposefully gave weapons to Syrian rebels with ties to al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. In his remarks last week Biden also chastised Turkey and the United Arab Emirates for providing assistance to extremists. The vice president has already contacted government officials from both countries to explain himself. Although they were not necessarily inaccurate, Biden's statements were harmful to the United States' tenuous coalition with the Middle Eastern countries, and they fueled concerns that Biden, a presumed 2016 presidential candidate, isn't tactful enough to serve as the nation's Commander in Chief. Scroll down for video . Vice President Joe Biden speaks about the minimum wage at an event at a Mexican restaurant on Monday in Las Vegas, Nevada. Biden is expected to apologize to Saudi officials in the immediate future for remarks he made last week criticizing the country . The gaffe-prone vice president has made a number of verbal slip-ups in the last several weeks. During a speech on Sept. 16 Biden called money-lenders who prey on soldiers serving abroad 'shylocks,' a word that is considered to be offensive to Jewish people. The following day the vice president described an Asian politician as the 'wisest man in the Orient.' Orient and oriental are terms generally acceptable for tangible objects from Asia, but not for people. At the same event that Biden criticized Middle Eastern countries for their hand in the ascent of the Islamic State, he joked that being vice president can be a 'b***h' at times. In yet another blunder, Biden told students attending his speech, which was held on the campus of Harvard University, that working with Saudi Arabia in the fight against ISIS was like Hitler's pairing with Joseph Stalin during World War II. 'We knew Stalin was no-good S.O.B. from the beginning,' Biden said. 'But there is a thing called self-interest.' The vice president prefaced the joke by saying he was 'being a little facetious.' 'All generalizations are false, including this one I’m about to make,' he noted. Biden, right, speaks with  Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman during yesterday's event in Las Vegas. Biden was on the first leg of a six-city campaign swing that includes stops in Nevada, California, Oregon and Washington state . Still, the ad-libbed statements at public events have the vice president's advisers wishing he would stick to the script, the Associated Press reports. Former aides to Biden who spoke with AP said that most of the time the vice president stays on message. 'But sometimes their pleas not to freelance were met with a roll of the eyes by Biden,' AP wrote, pointing out that before he became second-in-line for the presidency, Biden served  on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for many years and has 'strong views of his own' on foreign policy. Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf cautioned that Biden will have a problem obtaining his party's support in 2016 if he keeps up the antics. 'When he makes missteps, he becomes a character,' Sheinkopf told the Associated Press. 'Although he may be successful in lining up some of the Democratic leadership, he will be less likely to get the Democratic nomination if he looks foolish,' he added. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest came to Biden's defense on Monday during his daily briefing, calling him 'somebody who continues to be a core member of the president’s national security team. Prodded about Biden's verbal missteps, Earnest told reporters, 'I think the vice president is somebody who has enough character to admit when he's made a mistake.' 'He's made a lot of mistakes in a short period of time,' one of Earnest's questioners replied.","In remarks on Friday Biden chastised the countries for providing military assistance to Syrian rebels with ties to al Qaeda and other terrorist groups .

"It is said the harder you work, the luckier you get. Heather Watson, who has grafted as much as anyone this year, got her break when she was gifted a walkover to the semi-final of the Aegon International in Eastbourne.

It is the first time a Briton has reached the last four of the pre-Wimbledon tournament since Jo Durie in 1982. Watson hopes to do better than Durie, who was beaten by Martina Navratilova. It is only the second time that Watson has reached the last four of a WTA tour singles tournament. The first culminated in her winning the Japan Open in October 2012.

"Tiger Woods has started hitting full shots with a driver again, raising hopes that he might be able to make his comeback at the Open Championship at Royal Liverpool next month. The 38-year-old American, who missed the first two majors of the season following back surgery, has been seen on the range at the Medallist club, near his home in Jupiter, Florida. Although it’s a long way from picking up a driver again to playing in the game’s showpiece event, the fact Woods is able to practice with every club in the bag for the first time in three months suggests his return to the game might not be too far away. Back trouble: Tiger Woods has missed the last two major championships through injury . Good news: The 14-time major champion has started to swing his driver again after back surgery . VIDEO Woods BACK hitting shots . Multiple sources told the Golf Channel in America that Woods is targeting the Open, which is still four weeks away and where he claimed one of his most famous major victories in 2006. That came just a month after the death of his father Earl, and Woods wept openly on the 18th green as he dedicated his triumph to the man who taught him the game. For the sport itself, the return of the 14-time major champion cannot come soon enough. Martin Kaymer’s eight-stroke triumph in the US Open on Sunday proved a huge turn-off for television audiences, with viewing figures in America down as much as 70 per cent on Justin Rose’s narrow victory over Phil Mickelson a year earlier. Emotional: Woods won the 135th Open Championship at Hoylake shortly after the death of his father . Woods's agent Mark Steinberg told the PGA Tour's website: 'Tiger is making continual progress. 'He feels better each day and (is able to) extend his swing as he moves forward.'","Woods is recovering from back surgery .

"Celebrity chef Pete Evans has gone on another rant this week and attacked the the Heart Foundation for the use of its trademark Tick on many everyday supermarket products. The My Kitchen Rules judge, who is now a convert to the Paleo diet and based in Sydney, has questioned why the red tick appears on many products like frozen pizzas and kids chocolate breakfast cereal which don't appear to be healthy and good for the heart. The Tick appears on products like Milo chocolate cereal, Praise mayonnaise, Crisco vegetable oil, McCain Pizza Singles, Tablelands canola spread and extra light Philadelphia cream cheese. The paleo diet, which Evans is a supporter of, bans all types of dairy and grains, but promotes meat, eggs, vegetables and natural oils . Peter Evans has joined a campaign on Facebook for the well known Heart Foundation Tick to be dropped from certain foods . Many supermarket products across Australia include the Heart Foundation Tick . The Heart Foundation says these products are 'designed to help guide consumers' towards making healthier choices when they are shopping and deciding on what products to purchase . The 41-year-old took to his Facebook page to say: 'I am wondering, how does a someone get 'the Heart Foundation' to put a TICK on their product? 'Is 'The Heart Foundation' paid by multi national [sic] food corporations to have their TICK put onto their products or do they do it for voluntarily? 'How can this organisation publicly attack a way of life that is helping families reclaim their health in the most natural way possible?' Evans (left) has taken to his Facebook page in recent weeks to rant about his opinions on a range of topics . A storm erupted on social media when Mr Evans posted this picture of a ham and pineapple pizza with the Tick on it . The television presenter and author got into disagreement with the Dietitians Association of Australia (DAA) over the merits of the Paleo diet last week and now the row has escalated to include the Heart Foundation tick. He was also slammed for a 2100 post on Facebook which claimed that the Paleo diet can prevent autism. The outspoken celebrity's latest Facebook post came after Barbara Eden from the Heart Foundation said in a Ten Eyewitness News report people who solely eat a Paleo diet 'are putting their heart health at risk'. She said: 'They're putting their heart health at risk... we know that high levels of saturated fat in a diet increase people's risk of heart disease. Mr Evans now lives on a Paleo diet which has been described as 'caveman diet' and going back to basics . The diet controversially cuts out gluten, grains, dairy, sugar and preservatives . The Heart Foundation has warned against adopting the diet long term and says people need a balanced diet . 'And the second thing we're concerned about I think is the fact that this particular diet doesn't include all food groups.' The paleo diet encourages a high intake of meat, and cuts out gluten, grains, dairy, sugar and preservatives. The Heart Foundation has warned against adopting the diet long term and says people need to eat a balanced diet. Evans wants people to sign a petition by Jessie Reimers from Brisbane called Boycott the Tick #heartfoundationpetition. Ms Reimers has over 32,000 signatures and says the Heart Foundation should stop giving advice and promoting food that causes heart disease. In Evan's book on Paleo eating he shares his favourite recipes for good health and vitality . Heart Foundation National CEO Mary Berry said the organisation encourages people to eat a healthy balanced diet that comprises of a wide variety of fresh foods everyday. She explained the Tick is 'designed to help guide consumers' towards making healthier choices while they are shopping. 'The reality is that millions of Australians shop in supermarkets everyday and Tick recognises that when it comes to food, many people choose packaged foods, so the Tick is designed to help guide consumers towards a healthier product while they’re standing in the supermarket isle. 'These small simple changes can make a big difference to a family’s health.'To be eligible to carry the Tick, packaged foods must meet strict nutrition standards, including a combination of lower saturated fat, trans fat, salt and kilojoules, and higher fibre, calcium, wholegrain, fruits and vegetables, than other products of the same type. 'This means that when choosing a food that carries the Tick, shoppers can be confident they are selecting one of the healthier foods of that type. 'Every single product must meet strict nutritional standards to obtain Tick approval. Foods are independently analysed to ensure they meet nutrient criteria before they receive the Tick,' she added. Four years ago Mr Evans wrote a book with the Heart Foundation called Cooking with Heart in which he used some of the Tick approved products. He says he was 'thrilled and honoured'  to do the book but it wasn't until three years ago he looked at his own health and started researching new information on food. He told Daily Mail Australia: 'I believe the Heart Foundation stands for something noble and I want to continue to support the work they do in the community. 'However I believe as do a lot of medical experts that the heart tick should be removed from quite a few products that contain an excess of added sugars, numbers and other questionable items that are marketed to children and the general public. 'I would like to work with the heart foundation and supply them with recipes that is backed up by current non bias research.'","Paleo chef questions how certain products get awarded a Heart Foundation Tick .

"England can still win the 2015 World Cup but the right lessons need to be learned from this tour — and there needs to be fundamental changes in the way we play which will have a considerable knock-on effect on selection. What we saw in the first half in Hamilton last night only reinforced what we witnessed in third quarter in Dunedin last week. Head coach Stuart Lancaster faces some major decisions, but the clock is not his friend. He has one huge factor in his favour and that is ‘home’ advantage. But even that will be lost unless some real soul-searching is carried out ... and quickly. Whitewash: England were on the end of a 3-0 series defeat against New Zealand . Job on his hands: Stuart Lancaster has got work to do if England want to win the World Cup on home soil next year . Is he content for England to be competitive in 2015 — and with home advantage they will definitely be that — or is he prepared to aim for the ultimate and change the way his team plays? My worry is that there is already talk about winning in 2019, and to look that far ahead is nonsense . Quite simply, England are not quick enough man for man and as a collective at the very highest level. Everybody in the All Blacks’ back division has pace and poses a massive threat individually and in unison, whereas England yesterday only had Marland Yarde and Ben Youngs firing any bullets in the 36-13 defeat. And then Kieran Read, Richie McCaw and Jerome Kaino in the backrow looked a yard quicker than the England trio throughout the game. Pace is absolutely everything at this level — you are not going to bully yourself to victory against the top southern hemisphere teams. Talk about a decent second half is misguided. That was a really disappointing England performance, much more than a bad day at the office. That was a step backwards and the gulf in class was alarming. Yet, so too was the way in which the game was played and that must come down to Lancaster and his coaching staff. Nor do I want to hear any more about the England rugby culture and values. Quickstep: Kieran Read was one of New Zealand's star performers during the match . Paceman: Marland Yarde was one of the few players offering England a threat of pace . That has to be an absolute ‘given’ and to me the values have always been there despite the highly publicised issues at the last World Cup. A great rugby culture isn’t going to win you a World Cup, although its absence can lose you a tournament. South Africa, Australia and especially New Zealand have all five-star rugby cultures themselves; ask any Kiwi what the shirt means in New Zealand. What can really win England the World Cup is world-class coaching and selection, followed by execution by the players. So the core question is this: Do England continue to go down the current path or do they change before it’s too late? Do England stick with a big strong pack, but at this level a yard short of pace, augmented by big strong backs and an international class goal-kicker? Or do they look for a much more dynamic and adaptable game plan with pace throughout the team to prize open opposition defences. To me, this is not a gamble but a necessity for the growth of the game in England. It has to be the latter. It doesn’t matter how big and powerful you are because New Zealand and South Africa will simply knock you over. For me, Manu Tuilagi is potentially a great player but his physicality is nothing special when you play against these guys. He didn’t look in the same league as the Ma’a Nonu and Malakai Fekitoa yesterday. England would get so much more out of him if they developed his passing game and used him as a decoy rather than just a battering ram. He has to be much more than that. He could yet play inside centre if they adopted a game plan that brings out those skills. We saw a brilliant off-load from him to create a try for Chris Ashton last week. You will see the best of Manu when you have the likes of Danny Cipriani at fly-half and Anthony Watson adding his pace and X-factor on the right wing. Yarde will be much more effective if he has like-minded attacking players in support and we will then begin to see the best of Mike Brown again as an attacking force. The more pace and invention, the better. Players will  feed off each other and become even more dangerous. Potential: Manu Tuilagi has what it takes to be a great player . Invetion: Mike Brown tackled by two New Zealand players during the match . Just look at New Zealand. If England take that route then they must change the composition of the backrow. It’s just too slow if you are going to play at the sort of pace I am talking about. But if they decide that type of game is beyond them then Lancaster’s current selection is perfect. Against the very best you just can’t have Tom Wood and Billy Vunipola starting together. Which brings us back to an issue that will not go away — Steffon Armitage. He has to be included because he is the best natural openside England have and the artificial circumstances of his non-selection are ridiculous. I would move Chris Robshaw to No 8 and bring in a fit-again Tom Croft at blindside wing forward for the first game of the autumn, which just happens to be against New  Zealand at Twickenham. England aren’t a million miles away and they looked very tired at an end of a long season playing in the toughest of rugby environments. The players we need have been knocking around for a while. We just haven’t had them on the pitch at the same time, with everybody singing from the same hymn sheet. Selection headache: Steffon Armitage must start for England in the future, believes Woodward . Deflated: Tom Wood (left) and Ben Morgan reflect on their defeat . England have some serious thinking to do and, while the focus must be firmly on the future, I would demand a special meeting with the RFU if I was Lancaster and make it clear that they have badly let him and English rugby down. In fact he should have made that clear a year ago when the end-of-season farce became apparent. It is utterly unacceptable that England embark on a three-match Test series against the world champions on their own patch with almost half his first-choice players unavailable because of club commitments. There can be no debate on this. Such a cock-up must never happen again. Those absentees had a huge knock-on effect and led to selection  confusion. The First Test is vital and if England had arrived with their ‘Gun’ team, fully prepared and raring to go, they would probably have won and the series might have been unfolded differently. England were ambushed and what followed has been a huge wake-up call. All is not lost — but it is now decision time. My team for England's next test (vs New Zealand on November 8):Backs: 15 Brown, 14 Watson, 13 Burrell ,12 Tuilagi, 11 Yarde, 10 Cipriani, 9 CareForwards: 1 Corbisiero, 2 Hartley, 3 Cole, 4 Launchbury, 5 Lawes, 6 Croft, 7 Armitage, 8 Robshaw (c)","England can still win 2015 World Cup, according to Sir Clive Woodward .

"Juggling your job while driving might seem like an all-too difficult task for some, and that  proved to be just the case for Melbourne radio's Mark Allen on Monday. Allen, a former Australian golfing professional and regular on SEN radio, was talking major moot points from the Ryder Cup Golf Tournament with SEN host Kevin Bartlett when the hands-free interview he was conducting went horribly wrong. The golfing guru was halfway through his expert commentary, when the sound of two cars colliding burst through the speakers of  listeners' airwaves during their drive home from work. Scroll down for Audio . The black Mercedes Mark Allen was driving when he hit the driver in front during Monday's The Run Home segment . The pair were chatting on the radio network's The Run Home segment, before the sound of Allen's shiny black Mercedes was heard crashing in to the car in front. The pair joked about the fact he was 'obviously on hands free' before Allen was immediately instructed not to say anything further following about the crash due to 'legal reasons.' Host Kevin Bartlett said it was 'the first time we've had a crash on live radio.' 'Can you believe that he's had a crash while speaking on radio, that is a first, that is an absolute first,' he said. 'I reckon's that'd  make a good promo, don't you think?' he asked listeners. Twitter users compared the golfer's skills to his poor driving capabilities . Mark Allen, left, was talking with AFL great and host of The Run Home when the incident occurred on Monday afternoon . Prior to the mid-afternoon bingle Allen had been providing expert commentary on the Ryder Cup tournament where he was breaking-down the swings of each European and US golfer. He was just about to start getting started on world number 11 Phil Mickelson before crashing into the car in front. He had been referring to statistics inside the car of each golfer, but insisted he was driving and talking in a legal manner when he came to rest on a Melbourne road. 'Ohh, I've just crashed KB, I've just crashed...I've just crashed my car.' He confirmed he and the woman were both uninjured. Most concerning to Kevin Bartlett was not the safety of the occupants involved, however, but the mere fact he'd just buckled his bright looking Mercedes. 'Not the Mercedes?' Bartlett said. Allen, upon reassuring listeners about his rear-end bingle, told Bartlett the situation was under control. 'Yeah, I'm OK, everybody's OK, the lady in front is OK.' To Bartlett's surprise, he thought Allen had pulled over on the side of the road but was in fact using his hands-free device to talk and drive at the same time. Moments after the incident Allen put a call out to his Mercedes dealer in a plug for the car company to tell him that the vehicle was 'OK.' 'If Craig Howard is listening from Berry Mercedes Benz, everything is OK Craig.' It appeared Mr Howard was listening, and he instructed Bartlett to tell Allen not to say anything further 'for legal reasons.' 'Don't say anything for legal reasons that's what's coming through from Craig Howard at the moment.' Bartlett said the network were considering using the crash audio as a future 'promo' for the show.","Radio segment ended swiftly when caller crashed during live interview .

"A rescue home cat has finally found loving owners after people were put off by his Dracula-like fangs. Timmy, a nine-year-old black cat, has an enormous pair of front teeth which stick out of his mouth like a vampire. The nine-year-old moggy was taken into the Blue Cross rehoming centre in Lewknor, Oxfordshire, around three months ago. Vampire cat: Timmy's Dracula-like fangs put off prospective owners for months but he has finally found a home .

"England stormed into their fourth successive Women’s World Cup final on Wednesday night as a devastating scrum onslaught and a superb all-round performance by goal-kicking centre Emily Scarratt quelled spirited Irish resistance. Gary Street’s team fell behind to an early Ireland try at Stade Jean Bouin in Paris, but once the pack had established a formidable set-piece platform the result became a glaring formality. They were in front from the 33rd minute and went on to touch down five times. What began as a compelling contest turned into a rout as the Red Rose forwards — led by veteran props Rochelle ‘Rocky’ Clark and Sophie Hemming — blasted their opponents into set-piece oblivion. The scale of their dominance was astounding, while initial lineout problems were gradually overcome and the back row were ferociously combative. Try time: Kay Wilson of England touches down during the IRB Women's Rugby World Cup semi-final matchx . Anthems: England line up before their match against Ireland at Stade Jean Bouin . Yet, the victors produced ample creativity to go with their clout and commitment. In their pool-stage draw with Canada there was no real cutting edge but this semi-final was illuminated by the footwork of full back Danielle Waterman and pace out wide from Kat Merchant and Kay Wilson. In midfield, Scarratt spread constant mayhem; carving through the opposition repeatedly and kicking 11 points. This had all the makings of a close encounter. Ireland had stunned champions New Zealand to send the previously imperious Black Ferns crashing out of the tournament, but they were unable to hit such heights again, while England rose to the occasion in fine style. Despite Maggie Alphonsi’s typically relentlessly defensive efforts, the Irish went over from a lineout drive in the 16th minute to take the lead, but their advantage was short-lived. Through the gap: Emily Scarratt of England escapes a challange from Nora Stapleton and Grace Davitt . Try No 1 for England saw Clark plunge over from close range to level proceedings. The first of Scarratt’s two penalties put her side in front, then the No 13 created the next try with a long-range break down the left. The ball was shipped across to the far side and Merchant claimed her 44th try in her 57th appearance for England. After the break, the procession went on as the scrum mis-match continued. England captain Katy McLean shunned the option of a shot at goal from a 57th minute penalty and made the decision pay off with the decisive pass to send Wilson hurtling in at the left corner.a . With 19 points between the teams, the game was up, but the runners-up from the last World Cup were in no mood to ease up. Galvanised by their replacements, England struck twice more, with both tries coming from Wasps flanker Marlie Packer. Evasive: England captain Katy Mclean throws looks for a way past Stapleton and Niamh Briggs . She burst through a crowd of defenders and stretched over for her first, before pouncing on Rachael Burford’s deft kick through for her second. When the one-way traffic finally stopped, McLean said: ‘We knew Ireland would be very tough but the result reflects our performance. We showed that when we get it right, we can cause teams a lot of problems.’ If they can reach the same standards again in Sunday’s final, the title they have long craved will be theirs for the taking.

"Lewis Hamilton feels his startling turnaround over the course of the British Grand Prix weekend has fuelled his belief anything is possible this season. Hamilton recovered from another miserable qualifying run last Saturday, in which he made an error of judgement to hand Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg pole position, to take the chequered flag by the end of Sunday. Starting from sixth on the grid represented the lowest position from which Hamilton has gone on to claim victory in Formula One, with 27 successes now to his name, matching that of three-times champion Sir Jackie Stewart. Spurred on: Lewis Hamilton's victory in the British Grand Prix has given him confidence in his title chances . Next step: Hamilton must now build on his Silverstone success in the German Grand Prix in Hockenheim . Crucially for Hamilton, Rosberg suffered his first retirement of the year and the gap between them heading into Sunday's home race for the German at Hockenheim is now just four points. Given the euphoria from the fans that followed Hamilton's success at Silverstone, that weekend may well prove to be a turning point. At the very least the 29-year-old now knows what can be achieved from one day to the next, no matter the circumstances. 'I look at it very positively, a massive turnaround that just shows you everything is possible, no matter how difficult or bad it is,' said Hamilton. 'Every day there is a new opportunity, and I now see an opportunity to turn things around while knowing there is still a long way to go. 'It's about making sure I have that mentality because there's going to be days when it's not going to be great, where there will be a Friday, Saturday or Sunday that doesn't work out. 'But then you know there is an opportunity the next weekend.' Storming form: Hamilton started in sixth place at Silverstone after a poor qualifying race but came first overall . Step up: Hamilton has admitted he must improve his form in qualifying races . For Hamilton, an error-free qualifying on Saturday is his first port of call to ensuring the confidence lift from Silverstone does not rapidly fade. Mistakes have been made in the last three qualifying sessions that have proven costly for Hamilton. 'Looking at the races I'm confident I have the pace,' he said. 'Obviously the car is fantastic and I do have the pace to deliver, it's just because there is so much pressure there that sometimes you get it and sometimes you don't. 'I guess in the last three or four qualifying sessions I know I could have done better, but for the races I've done pretty well. 'They have always been strong, it's just the qualifying, and it's not been a huge, big, big problem. 'I don't need to change too much, just maybe small things.' Closing in: Hamilton is now only four points behind Drivers' World Championship leader Nico Rosberg . Hamilton finished practice just 0.024 seconds clear of Rosberg in a now customary one-two for Mercedes, however, the opposition were closer. The removal from all cars of the front-and-rear-interconnected (FRIC) suspension device that race director Charlie Whiting threatened to ban after suggesting it was illegal, may have played a part. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo finished a tenth of a second adrift of the Mercedes pair, whilst there were another six drivers within a second of the top two. Jenson Button was seventh overall in his McLaren, 0.880secs down, with Marussia's Max Chilton 21st and 3.5secs back.

Dramatic footage showed the top of the smoke stack breaking off while flames were seen coming out of it and thick, black smoke blew over surrounding areas of Port Kembla. Their efforts were assisted by the pouring rain but authorities were yet to decide whether the entire stack needs to be pulled down. A NSW Police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia there have been no reports of injuries or deaths. She also confirmed the fire had been contained to the site, and multiple fire and rescue units arrived to battle the blaze.

"It was the story that had everyone paralysed with fear. However, a group of spider specialists now claim the tale of the 'Bunbury Spiderman' belongs in nightmares, rather than real life. Scroll down for video . Dylan Thomas, 21, was holidaying with friends last weekend when he woke up to find a strange red trail stretching up his stomach . Dr Volker Framenau, an Archaeologist, says: 'If you look at a spider, the fangs, the mouth parts they have, they are not able to burrow. They can't get through skin' Dylan Thomas was travelling in Bali earlier this month when he suffered from 'a really burning sensation like a searing feeling' in his stomach. He claimed he sought medical attention, at which point a dermatologist removed a 'tropical spider' from his stomach with tweezers. The Age have spoken with a number of local scientists who claim to have debunked the 'Bunbury Spiderman' story which went viral on Thursday, and was shared thousands of time around the world. Dr Volker Framenau, an Archaeologist from the Department of Terrestrial Zoology in Western Australia, said: 'If you look at a spider, the fangs, the mouth parts they have, they are not able to burrow. They can't get through skin.' Dr Framenau said it was much more likely the animal was mite, as some of these can resemble a spider. He said if the creature had been collected, there would be less confusion as what it actually was, and would prevent the spread of a possible virus. Dr Mark Harvey, the Senior Curator of Arachnology at the West Australian Museum, said he had never heard of spiders being able to survive beneath the skin of any mammal . Dr Harvey said spiders would suffocate if they burrowed inside human skin: 'Spiders need air to breathe. Being under the skin of somebody, I would have thought they wouldn't have enough air to survive' Dr Mark Harvey says the fear of spiders fuels urban myths from people hoping to instil fear . Dr Mark Harvey, the Senior Curator of Arachnology at the West Australian Museum, said he had never heard of spiders being able to survive beneath the skin of any mammal. 'Spiders need air to breathe, they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs. Being under the skin of somebody, I would have thought they wouldn't have enough air to survive,' he told The Age. Harvey said the fear most people have of spiders fuels urban myths from those hoping to instil fear. It's not the first time spider fallacies has been debunked by science. Last month, Charles Griswold, a spider expert at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, said the popular myth that 'humans unwittingly swallow 8 spiders a year' was highly unlikely and unsupported by scientific evidence.","Dylan Thomas, 21, was holidaying in Bali when he noticed a red trail appearing on his stomach .

"A teenager who apparently never swore couldn't stop cursing after getting his wisdom teeth pulled. American YouTube user mlprice31 filmed her son Cameron shouting out a range of expletives after undergoing the procedure. 'N**ga I'm hungry,' he slurs on the car journey home, adding that he wants a meal from Jack in the Box despite being unable to eat with a swollen mouth. Scroll down for video . Changed person: YouTube user mlprice31 filmed her son Cameron shouting out a range of expletives after undergoing a wisdom tooth extraction . 'Cameron, can you stop cussing?' his mother tells him. She then asks him if he's alright as he incessantly mumbles away with his eyes closed. He reassures her that he feels 'good' and it's just that the laughing gas has made him high. Cameron's bad behavior continues as he proceeds to unbuckle his seat belt. He also threatens to take his shirt off because he's feeling hot. Finally after the stressful  journey, the car pulls up in the driveway at home. Welcome home: The teen is greeted by his grandmother, who is unsure what to make of his dazed state . Not with it: He is later seen lay slumped on the couch, mumbling and waving his arms in the air . The teen is greeted by his grandmother, who is unsure what to make of his dazed state. It takes several minutes to persuade Cameron to get out of the car. Some wisdom teeth extractions are performed with local anesthesia, numbing the area from where the tooth is removed. Alternatively, patients are given oral medication, such as Valium or Ativan, before the procedure and require an escort home while the effects wear off. Another option is intravenous sedation, administered through IV. Although a patient is conscious throughout they are usually completely unaware of the procedure. An escort home is vital while the sedation wears off. When he does get out of the vehicle, he can barely stand up straight. His grandmother tries to help him walk by holding him around the stomach. She is seen smiling at the camera as she struggles to offer support. When Cameron eventually makes it to the front door of his home, he doesn't seem to know where he is. 'I ain't going into that motherf***ing place. You n**ga's crazy . . . What you all doing to me?' he cries out. With a bit of persuasion he is corralled inside the house and the video cuts to to show him lay slumped on the couch, mumbling and waving his arms in the air.

"Pastor Maldonado has been confirmed as a Lotus driver for the 2015 Formula One season. The current campaign has been a troubled one for Maldonado and Lotus so far, with the Venezuelan yet to score a point for the Enstone-based marque. But given Lotus' seemingly difficult financial circumstances at times, the money Maldonado brings with him from state-owned oil giant PDVSA helps considerably. Staying put: Pastor Maldonado will remain at Lotus next season . On track: The Venezuelan is currently at Hockenheim for the German Grand Prix . It means owner Gerard Lopez has wasted little time in confirming one half of his driver line-up for next season. Speaking to his team's website, Lopez said: 'I don't want to give too much away, but as it's halfway through the season I can confirm 50 per cent of our driver line-up for 2015 as Pastor is with us for next year. 'Despite the difficulties we've had so far this season, he recognises our true potential as a team and we recognise his true potential as a driver. 'We will achieve great things together.' As for Romain Grosjean, who Lopez has previously claimed has the talent to drive for a bigger team, the Frenchman's future remains uncertain.","Maldonado confirmed as a Lotus driver for 2015 F1 season .

"Glorious failure was England’s shattering fate at Eden Park on Saturday, but their dejected, defiant response told its own story of rising standards and ambitions. After pushing the world champions to the brink of a monumental upset, Stuart Lancaster and his squad made it plain that being gallant losers will not suffice. There was a collective satisfaction about the way they had overcome considerable pre-match adversity to take the All Blacks to the edge of the abyss, but restrained pride was trumped by an acute sense of angst. VIDEO Scroll down to see Lewis Moody correctly predict an England first game loss . Knock-out blow: All Blacks centre Conrad Smith scored the decisive try with two minutes left to play . Time to shine: If England play their cards right, they can join a small group to have won in England . Heartbreak: England must bounce back from their loss and keep the series alive with victory in Dunedin . War dance: The All Blacks perform the haka ahead of kick off at Eden Park . On target: Freddie Burns kicks a penalty during England's first Test against New Zealand . This was not how the script was supposed to play out. This was not the mismatch widely predicted. It was a tight, tense, gruelling encounter and England were not behind until 10 minutes from the end. They were weakened, written off and cast as mere cannon fodder, but they would not accept that a New Zealand victory was pre-ordained. Instead, Lancaster’s scratch line-up — decimated by injuries and a personnel shortage caused by  fixture congestion — took the fight to the hosts and outplayed them in most areas. Amid a multitude of exceptional individual performances No 8 Ben Morgan was a titanic figure, driving his side on to the front foot and deep into enemy territory, while Manu Tuilagi was the fulcrum of the  back-line threat as he resumed his wrecking-ball routine. The Leicester centre repeatedly blasted gaping holes in the home defence and the fact that he was given the ammunition to do so was testament to the men who had been identified as potential weak links for the tourists. Circumstances had brought Freddie Burns and Kyle Eastmond together as an untried 10-12 axis and the fear was that they would be exposed by the All Blacks. Bombing forward: Englandís Chris Robshaw makes a break against New Zealand at Eden Park in Auckland . Back with a bang: James Haskell is tackled Dane Coles on his England comeback . Clockwork: England's Geoff Parling rises highest to claim the ball from a line-out . On the charge: Israel Dagg makes a break from full back in the first Test . That doomsday scenario did not come to pass, as the England pair held firm and caused far more  trouble than they were forced to endure. Burns kicked all his penalties, pulled the strings with real authority and committed body and soul to tackling duties. Eastmond, meanwhile, was a revelation — displaying nifty footwork, a willingness to play flat to the line and a knack for  sending Tuilagi into space with beautifully delayed passes. So many others stood out, too, from hooker Rob Webber — who made light of a lack of game-time in the last month to turn in a superb shift at hooker — to Geoff Parling and James Haskell. At the forefront of the epic effort was Chris Robshaw, who led by stirring example and  eclipsed his legendary rival Richie McCaw. But the captain was not prepared to accept praise for himself and his team as any sort of compensation for a negative outcome. ‘We’re extremely proud of all the effort that’s gone in, to come here and do that, but we can’t be happy with it,’ said the Harlequins flanker. ‘The standards we set for each other now and the standards we play at; we’re coming down here to win a Test series, simple as that. ‘We genuinely thought we could win here. That’s the position we have got to with English rugby. But it’s one thing being in a good place and another thing winning.’ Robshaw’s reaction to this agonising defeat highlighted the fact that England do not harbour an inferiority complex against the world’s pre-eminent rugby nation — they are convinced that beating them is within their scope. Flying winger: England's Jonny May attempts to beat the tackle of Liam Messam (left) and Ben Smith . Comeback: Aaron Cruden scored two penalties to put New Zealand back into the lead with ten minutes to go . Dangerous break: Kyle Eastmond charges at the New Zealand defence as England clear their lines . Quick ball: All Blacks scrum half Aaron Smith keeps the New Zealand attack ticking . Asked what they have to do better in Dunedin next week, the skipper added: ‘We’ve just got to win, simple as that. We got ourselves in some good positions at times, but didn’t quite finish them off. They probably got on our line twice and took a chance. That’s the difference.’ When it was put to him that the All Blacks will be markedly better in six days, Robshaw said: ‘Yeah, but so will we. We know we’re going to get stronger every week, but we were pretty evenly matched out there.’ That, in fact, is understating the English performance. In so many ways, they held the aces until the heartbreaking finale, when Conrad Smith touched down in the right corner two minutes from time to ensure New Zealand preserved their 20-year unbeaten record at this venue. Lancaster’s men made mistakes along the way, but they forced so many more from their opponents, whose rustiness was sometimes remarkable to behold. Rarely has an All Black team made so many basic handling errors. Heavy hitter: England No 8 Ben Morgan carries the ball upfield . Making yards: New Zealand's Brodie Retallick leaves England's Freddie Burns lying on the ground . Late blow: Marland Yarde is shown a yellow card by referee Nigel Owens after illegal play at the breakdown . Late charge: Danny Cipriani made an immediate impact after coming off the bench in the second half . Until the try at the end, the scoring had come down to a kicking duel, with Aaron Cruden’s five penalties matched by Burns’ four and one from his replacement, Danny Cipriani. Both sides relied on precise, contestable, in-field kicks to build pressure, but England had the clear upper hand in the set-piece, with Webber and Parling orchestrating a lineout masterclass. In the final analysis, what counted against England was that they could not quite capitalise on three or four prime try-scoring opportunities. Openings were created but the visitors were not clinical enough. Lancaster was asked if this was a missed chance to claim an historic victory and he said: ‘Yes, definitely. Now the game next week is huge for us because we want to tie the series and go to a decider in Hamilton believing we can win it.’ England will step up preparations for the Dunedin Test in the belief that they have nothing to fear from the world’s best team. Several high-class reinforcements are on standby to return and should ensure that intensity levels rise, rather than drop off after this loss. This series is not over yet. Glorious failure need not become a habit. Powerful: Malakai Fekitoa of the All Blacks is hauled down by Ben Morgan and Geoff Parling .

"Lewis Hamilton feels Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg was handed 'another gift' after a qualifying crash again put the Briton on the back foot in this year's Formula One world title fight. Hamilton suffered a failure of the front-right brake disk during the initial session for the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim. On approach to the left-handed loop inside the stadium complex, the failure immediately pitched Hamilton into a high-speed spin across a gravel trap, with his momentum halted by a 30g shunt into a tyre barrier. Unsurprisingly winded, Hamilton was at least able to radio back to his team, pointing out: 'I put my foot on the pedal and something failed.' Crash: Lewis Hamilton's hopes of winning the German GP have been scuppered after his qualifying crash . In the barriers: Hamilton suffered a brake failure, leaving team-mate Nico Rosberg to secure pole . Hamilton eventually clambered from the cockpit of his car, raising his right hand to acknowledge he was okay, before heading off to the medical centre for a medical inspection which is routine procedure following such a crash. The 29-year-old will now start 15th, moving up one place from his qualifying position of 16th due to Esteban Gutierrez serving a three-place grid penalty. To rub salt into Hamilton's wounds, Rosberg unsurprisingly went on to claim his fourth pole from the last five grands prix, and ninth of his F1 career. Not for the first time this season Hamilton faces another exercise in damage limitation to ensure the current four-point gap between the duo does not become too excessive again. Dejection: Hamilton will start only 15th for Sunday's German Grand Prix . Scene of the accident: The Mercedes man lost control of his car after he suffered a brake problem . Reflecting on his accident, Hamilton said: 'I'm in a little bit of pain, but that's what happens when you have a crash like that. Even if something is broken I will still be racing on Sunday. 'I think (the team) said I pulled something like 30g, but you never enter a corner thinking something will happen. 'Nico has now basically got another gift (with pole), but we will see what we can do.' Hamilton and Rosberg use different manufacturers for their brakes as it comes down to feel rather than a team dictating what a driver should have on the car, with the former Brembo and the latter using Carbon Industrie. Out in front: Rosberg will start on pole ahead of the Williams duo of Valtteri Bottas (right) and Felipe Massa . Hamilton's brakes were also new going into final practice earlier on Saturday, but whatever the circumstances, this is the latest qualifying blow to a man renowned for his speed over one lap. For Rosberg, this result continues his great week after getting married, watching Germany win the World Cup and signing a new long-term contract. 'Things have been going really well, and to be at my home race and to get pole is fantastic,' said Rosberg. Sparing a thought at least for Hamilton, he added: 'I would have preferred an open fight with Lewis, so I'm a little bit less happy he didn't have a shot at it at the end.'","Hamilton suffered brake failure in opening session and crashed at 165mph .

"Jonathan Dwyer was indicted late Friday on charges of assault in connection with two episodes of domestic violence against his wife, including one in which he broke her nose with a headbutt. The Arizona Cardinals running back received one charge of felony aggravated assault and eight misdemeanor charges of assault, criminal damage and disorderly conduct, according to the indictment released late Friday. The first episode between Dwyer and his wife, Kayla Tobin Dwyer, took place when she confronted him after learning of phone calls between him and another woman. Domestic violence: Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer (right) is accused of headbutting his wife, Kayla (center) after she refused his advances during an argument . As she argued with him, Dwyer attempted to kiss and undress her, and when she refused, police say Dwyer headbutted her, breaking her nose. A neighbor called the police after hearing the argument, but Dwyer hid in the shower while Kayla told officers she had not been assaulted. Police later said that Dwyer had instructed to tell the police he was not in the home or he would kill himself in front of her kids. The next day, Dwyer assaulted his wife again, punching her in the face, as well as hitting walls and throwing a shoe at their 17-month-old son. As she tried to call police, Dwyer grabbed the phone out of her hands and threw it down on the ground. Dwyer's wife left after the two assaults took place and did not reach out to police until Dwyer began texting her suicidal messages, including a photo of a knife. Arrested: Dwyer was arrested September 17 on assault charges in connection with two altercations at his home in July involving his family . After Dwyer was arrested, he admitted in interviews with police that he hid in the shower, though he denied allegations of assaulting his wife. Dwyer has been ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device and banned from having contact with his wife and son. The Cardinals put Dwyer on the reserve/non-football illness list, which prevents him from playing with Arizona for the rest of the season. Cuffed: Phoenix police officers escort Dwyer in cuffs. Dwyer confirm to officers he hid in the shower and later sent suicidal text messages to his wife, but said he did not assault her . Sidelined: The Cardinals deactivated Jonathan Dwyer from all team activities following his arrest . This is as opposed to the exempt/commissioner’s permission list which the Minnesota Vikings used to deactivate Adrian Peterson during his trial for child abuse. Reporter Kent Somers tweeted that the Cardinals will continue to pay Dwyer while he's on the non-football illness list. The NFL said Dwyer's case will be reviewed under the league's personal-conduct policy. The NFL has been rocked by domestic violence issues ever since a videotape surfaced that showed former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City, New Jersey, elevator. Then Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson was indicted on felony child-abuse charges. The Carolina Panthers put star defensive end Greg Hardy on the exempt list September 17 and said he will not play for the team until his domestic violence case is resolved.","Dwyer, 25, received eight misdemeanor charges of assault, criminal damage and disorderly conduct, as well as a felony aggravated assault charge from breaking his wife's nose with a headbutt .

"A pilot was removed from an aeroplane and arrested on suspicion of drink-driving, just moments before the he was scheduled to take off. The aircraft was due to fly from Newquay Airport to London Gatwick yesterday morning, but was cancelled causing passengers delays and in some cases missed connections. A concerned crew member alerted the police, who removed the pilot from the plane, a Bombardier Dash 8 turboprop, and breath-tested him. Scroll down for video . Drunk: The pilot from Exeter-based airline Flybe was about to fly passengers from Cornwall to London . A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said: 'A 48-year-old man from Crediton, Devon, was arrested on suspicion of being over the drink-drive limit. 'He was taken to Newquay police station. He has been released on police bail until December 8.' The pilot was named locally as Julian Lowden, who describes himself in an online profile as a pilot and former consultant stress engineer. A woman who came to the door of his detached, five-bed £400,000 home in Copplestone, Devon, refused to discuss the arrest. A neighbour said: 'To be honest she knows as much as you. She understands how serious this is.' Flybe said it is unable to name the pilot in light of the police investigation. The pilot was removed from the plane by police and breath-tested just moments before take-off. File picture. In the UK drink drive limit is 80 miligrammes per 100 mililitres. For pilots the blood/alcohol limit is 20 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. Source: Civil Aviation Authority . The arrest led to the flight being cancelled and some passengers facing delays of up to five hours. One traveller missed a connection flight to Mexico from Gatwick because of the delay. Passengers were told the pilot was 'unwell'. A Flybe spokesman said: 'Flybe can confirm that one of its pilots volunteered to help the police with their inquiries at Newquay Airport yesterday. 'The airline is not able to comment further while the police investigation is taking place.' The arrest came the same day as it was announced the low-cost airline would be operating the Newquay to Gatwick route for the next three years. Retired commercial pilot Andy Wilkins said he'd never heard of a pilot being arrested before a flight. 'It's very rare,' he said. 'I've never heard of my colleagues being tested - I wasn't. But the rules are very strict. 'Pilots are allowed a quarter of the limit for drivers. 'We always followed the adage, 'eight hours from bottle to throttle' - stop drinking at least eight hours before flying. But pilots are human and everyone is different.' The plane, due to fly from Newquay  to Gatwick, was cancelled causing passengers delays of up to five hours . Mr Wilkins added: 'Alcohol stays in the system for different times with different people. There's no regulation testing of pilots that I know of. They're generally very professional. 'But I guess it's down to their colleagues to raise the alert if they have concerns.' This is not the first instance of a pilot suspected of being under the influence. Last year, a Pakistani International Airlines pilot was jailed for nine months in Britain for being drunk before he was due to fly a plane with 156 people on board. Irfan Faiz, 55, was found to have three times the legal amount of alcohol in his blood, prosecutors told Leeds Crown Court. The father-of-two was asked to leave the cockpit during checks for the flight from Leeds Bradford airport to Islamabad on September 18 because he smelled of alcohol and was unsteady on his feet. In the US, 48 year-old American Eagle pilot, Kolbjorn Jarle Kristiansen, was removed from the cockpit after airline employees detected alcohol on his breath on him at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.

"This is the moment veteran television presenter Sir Tony Robinson was blown up by a 'bomb' as part of his new television series on the First World War. Although no stranger to a muddy ditch - thanks to his years presenting Time Team - to ensure Sir Tony had a realistic experience of what life in the trenches would have been like producers on the show decided to set off explosives  as he stood in a replica trench system in Suffolk. The 68-year-old actor said even though it was not a real bomb, the experience was still terrifying. Scroll down for video . Sir Tony Robinson (pictured) being 'blown up' in a replica trench system for an authentic WW1 experience . Sir Tony ducks and shields his head as the 'bomb' goes off in a replica First World War trench in Suffolk . He said: 'They let off a load of explosives to try and recapture for me what it would have been like. 'You just got blasted to pieces by this stuff,' he said. 'All I got was peat, can you imagine if it was rocks, human body parts and bits of petrol can?' Sir Tony is best known for his role as bullied dogsbody Baldrick in the classic comedy series Blackadder. He says he has a huge interest in the war as his grandfather fought but, like many of his generation, never spoke about his experiences - to the extent that Sir Tony does not even know the name of his grandfather’s battalion. Tony Robinson's World War One is a new four-part television series which tells the story of the Great War - how it started, what happened and how it changed the world. The exact moment the  'bomb' goes off - showering Sir Tony in peat and mud . Sir Tony (pictured left and right as Baldrick with Rowan Atkinson in Blackadder) says he is very interested in the war as his grandfather fought on the front line - but never spoke about his experiences . The programme will see Sir Tony visit the Memorial to the Missing in Ypres, fly a 100-year-old Bristol fighter plane and drive one of the first tanks. Sir Tony, who was knighted last year by the Duke of Cambridge, said filming the show gave him a little more insight into the horrific experiences of his grandfather, Private John Robinson, who fought on the front line. As part of the new series Sir Tony had the chance to fly a 199-year-old Bristol fighter plane (pictured) Sir Tony said: 'I don't know why he didn't talk about it but I can see why the unremitting horror might have been a reason why you want to blank it out.' Following his return from the war, his wife immediately set fire to his uniform and he never spoke of it again. Sir Tony says that while he knows his grandfather fought on the front line in 1917 and 1918, he will never know what exactly he experienced. With the aid of hundreds of archived 3D images, the programme will chronicle the war from start to finish and  aims to allow modern audiences to see the war in a completely new way. The images were taken 100 years ago, when three dimensional photography was extremely popular. Some of the amazing three dimensional images taken more than 100 years ago during the war, which will be explored in the new series - this shows soldiers getting ready for the Somme push in 1917 . This picture, date unknown, shows Highland Territorial soldiers in the trench with their mascot dog . This 3D picture shows soldiers in the German Army lining up - it was taken sometime before 1914 . The pictures were then viewed through specialist equipment known as a stereoscope. A Discovery Channel spokesman said: 'Sir Tony will also show how the Great War changed British people for generations to come - liberating large portions of the working class, powering the rise of the Labour party and breaking the old ties of service to the aristocracy.' The series was shot on location in Britain, France, Belgium and Germany, visiting many of the famous landmarks and battlefields from the war. The series will begin on Sunday at 8pm on the Discovery Channel, with Sir Tony visiting a Berlin Kaiserpanorama show, where he will explain the stereoscope 3D process and uses it to show Europe in 3D before the war.","Veteran presenter experienced horror of bombs in replica trench in Suffolk .

Life expectancy in the UK is increasing every year - dramatically increasing the costs of looking after the elderly . Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb said retiring later in life would boost people's incomes after work by 10 per cent a year . Ministers say that by working longer pensioners can boost their retirement income, leaving them less reliant on the state for their care costs. Steve Webb, the Liberal Democrat pensions minister, told the Telegraph the target was ‘ambitious’ but said it was already happening with women who were choosing to work longer. He said: ‘If someone works an extra year they can add 10 per cent to their pension for life. What we are doing is catching up with decades of longer living. ‘We are living longer but the labour market and people’s retirement age has not been keeping up. I have fought against a vague target of trying to get people to work longer to have something more specific.’ The Government's older workers' champion Ros Altmann said working longer boosts people's retirement incomes . Dr Ros Altmann, a pensions expert and the Government’s older workers’ champion, added: ‘There is certainly a great merit in enabling and encouraging people to work longer so that they can get higher incomes over their lifetimes.’ The number of over-65s in England is expected to increase by 51 per cent over the next 20 years, and the numbers of those aged 85 and above will double by 2030. Men are now retiring at 64 and eight months – while women stop work at 63 and a month. But the Government wants to see this rapidly increase to match the rise in the state pension age, which is expected to go up to 70 within the next 50 years. The target is contained in a document released by the Department for Work and Pensions which makes clear that an increase of six months would be a ‘meaningful change’. ‘An increase in the average age of withdrawal of more than around 0.5 years would demonstrate an improvement,’ the document states. Mr Webb has said that the growing numbers of people living into their eighties and nineties would leave taxpayers with a rising bill and meant ‘the sums’ would never add up if people continued to retire in their fifties. George Osborne announced earlier this year that increases in life expectancy will automatically trigger a rise in the state pension age, which is likely to rise to 70 within 50 years. The state pension age is currently 65 for men, and is rising from 60 for women to come into line with men at 66 by 2020. It will continue to rise so people in their late twenties are likely to have to work until their 70th birthdays, according to official projections. The Office for Budget Responsibility said that Coalition policies such as raising the state pension age will slash Britain’s debts.","Ministers say move needed to offset growing elderly care and pension costs .

"An eight-year-old girl who was the first in the world to beat a rare brain cancer has passed away just four months after her family were told she had overcome the terminal disease. Claudia Burkill from Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, died in her sleep this morning according to her family who said their lives had been 'destroyed in an instant'. She had been battling metastatic pineoblastoma since the age of five, and her parents were told on several occasions she only had weeks left. Eight-year-old Claudia Burkill died this morning after a three-year battle with a rare brain cancer. Her mother Andrea (left) said all the families lives had been 'destroyed in an instant' But just four months ago, the family were assured by astonished medics the tumour had vanished and the little girl had beaten the odds. Her mother Andrea said: 'Claudia died peacefully in her sleep in the early hours of this morning. Despite her long illness, ultimately, her death is an incredible shock to all that know and love her. 'We urge everyone to treat our family with the grace and dignity that you yourselves would wish for, if your life has just been destroyed in an instant. 'Please give us our privacy as we come to terms with Claudia's death and please give us our space to grieve.' She had been battling metastatic pineoblastoma since the age of five, and her parents were told on several occasions she only had weeks left . Claudia with her siblings, Zachery, Abigail and Esme and their father David on a family day out . The family's announcement followed more than 12 hours of torment after Claudia became unwell and failed to respond to treatment. Claudia was comforted by her pet cat Woody which she felt was 'watching over her' on the bed, her family said. She was due to have an operation in the past week, but it was delayed by a couple of weeks due to a recent infection. Her mother posted on her Facebook group, Claudia's Cause, on October 20 saying: 'Claudia has had a feeding tube for three years now and I cannot wait to see her beautiful face again without one.' She was due to have an operation in the past week, but it was delayed  due to a recent infection . Just four months ago, the family was assured by astonished medics the tumour had vanished and the little girl had beaten the odds . Claudia first became ill in June 2011 when the family returned after a holiday and she began vomiting. After first being told she had a virus, a second visit to Lincoln County Hospital and several tests, including a CT-scan, a lumbar puncture and an MRI, saw doctors diagnose her with a squint. Mrs Burkill was not satisfied with the diagnosis and after having Claudia transferred to Queens Medical Centre Nottingham, the lethal tumour was found at the centre of her brain. Over the following years, Mrs Burkill and her husband David  were told on four occasions that Claudia only had weeks to live and they had to start planning her funeral. Although she suffered some brain damage from the treatment, her family were positive that her health would improve. After being told her daughter was cancer free and no longer terminally ill in June this year, Mrs Burkill said: 'A miracle has happened, it really has. I just can't stop shaking.' Doctors only see three or four cases of metastatic pineoblastoma a year and there is still no known cure . Doctors only see three or four cases of metastatic pineoblastoma a year are there is still no known cure. Claudia first became ill in June 2011 when the family returned after a holiday and she began vomiting. Metastatic pineoblastoma is so rare doctors only see three or four cases a year. Claudia had treatment called The Milan Protocol at Nottingham Children's Hospital, involving some of the highest doses of chemotherapy ever administered to a child. The family has raised thousands of pounds for the children's brain tumour research centre at the University of Nottingham. A pineoblastoma is an aggressive, malignant brain tumor that originates from the pineal gland, a small organ located near the middle of the brain. Metastasis is the spread of a cancer or disease from one organ to another, not directly connected with it. Pineoblastomas account for only three to 10 per cent of the total primary malignant brain tumors in children and adults, so it is considered rare. This type of tumor is usually seen in patients less than twenty years of age, and is most common in children 10 years-old and younger. The pineal gland is a tiny endocrine organ that lies between the two hemispheres of the brain. Shaped like a pair of pine cones, the pineal gland produces the hormone melatonin, which helps regulate sleep patterns. More than 17 different types of benign and malignant tumors may arise in the pineal region of the brain. A pineoblastoma is one of the most common types of tumors in this area. The underlying cause of a pineoblastoma is currently unknown.

"Star pupil Shereka Marsh, 15, bled to death in minutes after being accidentally shot in the neck by her boyfriend . A teenage boy has been found guilty  of manslaughter after he accidentally shot his girlfriend dead as he showed off with an illegal handgun. Star pupil Shereka Marsh, 15, bled to death in minutes after she had gone to give the 15-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, a birthday present. The Old Bailey heard that the teenager had been posing with the fake Beretta handgun in his bedroom in Hackney, east London, while Shereka was visiting him on his birthday. He had been keeping the weapon - which had been used in a gangland shooting a month earlier - for an unknown criminal, also in Hackney. Shereka bled to death after the 7.65mm bullet passed through her wrist and into her neck. He had told police that the gun fired unexpectedly as they both handled the weapon. But in court he demonstrated how he was showing off in front of Shereka and had no idea it was loaded when he pulled the trigger 'accidentally'. The boy claimed that the gun was already cocked and ready to fire when he took it out of the box. He said he got the gun out of an Xbox box just to show her and when it went off, Shereka simply said: 'I've been shot', before collapsing on the bed. The youth then phoned 999 but she was pronounced dead later that afternoon, the court heard. On his arrest at the house, the boy told officers it was 'an accident' and exclaimed: 'Am I going to hell?' and: 'My girl died on my birthday.' He told the Old Bailey that he started playing with the gun and put both hands on the handle and pointed it at Shereka. The boy said: 'She wanted to touch it, she had never seen a gun before, she wanted to touch it, she was getting close to the gun so I told her not to touch it because she had no gloves on.' He added: 'At this point I decided to put it away, I got up off the bed, I had two hands on the gun. 'I was holding it with both hands on the handle, I was standing in front of Shereka. 'At this point I started showing off with the gun in my hands.' Asked why he did that the boy replied: 'To be honest, I don't know, at first I was laughing, she was smiling, I was waving the gun around.' The boy had been keeping the weapon - which had been used in a gangland shooting a month earlier - for a unknown criminal in Hackney, east London, the court heard. Forensic teams are pictured removing evidence . 'That's when I accidentally pulled the trigger.' He said he had taken the magazine out of the gun and did not know there was a bullet in the chamber. He admitted possession of a prohibited weapon and ammunition, a PB Birevetta 7.65mm self-loading pistol and nine un-fired 7.65mn calibre Browning cartridges, without a firearms certificate. The Old Bailey jury acquitted him of murder today but convicted him of manslaughter and possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life. Judge Charles Wide QC is expected to order reports before passing sentence. The Old Bailey heard that the teenager had been posing with the fake Beretta handgun in his bedroom while Shereka was visiting him . Shereka, a Year 11 pupil at the Unswick School in Hackney, was described as a hard-working student, predicted to do well in her GCSEs. The trial heard that she had spent the early afternoon of 22 March this year looking for presents for the boy at Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, east London. At around 3pm she called and said she was on her way to Hackney with his presents. He said he got the gun out of an Xbox box just to show her and when it went off, Shereka simply said: 'I've been shot', before collapsing on the bed . But just seven minutes later the boy called 999 to say that Shereka had been shot in the neck. When asked if the attackers were still there, he replied: 'They've gone.' By the time paramedics and police arrived Shereka was not breathing and had no pulse. A doctor arrived by helicopter to try and save her life but she was declared dead at 4.37pm. The boy, who was wearing gloves, told officers after his arrest: 'She's been shot. We were both holding it when it went off... I didn't even pull the trigger.' He also claimed that he found the PC Birivetta on Hackney Marsh but later admitted that he had been asked to keep it safe by someone. As he was taken to the police station he banged his head on the cage iand said: 'Can I say sorry to her mum? It was an accident. Am I going to hell? I didn't kill her.' A search of his room revealed a stab vest and nine unfired bullets in a Blackberry mobile handset box. Tests on the Birivetta - a copy of a 1930s Beretta - revealed it had also been used in a shooting which left three men injured at Median Road in Clapton on 21 February this year. Detectives also found photos of the boy pointing two handguns at the camera. One of the pictures was found on Shereka's phone. Prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC admitted there was no evidence of any motive for the boy deliberately killing Shereka. But he told jurors: 'The evidence suggests that the gun fired as a result of the defendant deliberately pulling the trigger as he stood in front of her, pointing the gun towards her neck while she was holding up her left hand. 'If he did shoot Shereka in a fit of anger which he immediately regretted, then this would not be the first case of its kind. 'At some stage he aimed the gun at Shereka's neck, and exerted concerted effort to pull the trigger and failed to ensure the gun was not loaded by pulling back the slide. 'We say that he failed in his duty of care to Shereka, and was grossly negligent in using the gun in her presence.'","Shereka Marsh, 15, bled to death after being accidentally shot in the neck .

"Despite protestations of public loyalty from senior Labour figures, behind the scenes even shadow cabinet members who still believe in Ed Miliband (and they are rapidly decreasing in number) are pressing for a change in style and direction. They know Miliband neither looks nor sounds the part of the Leader of the Opposition, let alone Prime Minister-in-waiting. With six months to the election, there is pressure from those shadow ministers for senior MPs and trade union leaders to see Miliband in private and persuade him to make way for a caretaker leader like Alan Johnson, former home secretary, because there is no mechanism to force a leadership ballot so close to an election. Scroll down for video . Despite assurances from Ed Miliband that his party is on course for an election victory in 2015, behind closed doors shadow ministers are said to be calling for him to step aside . One senior Labour source said: ‘The calls are pouring into the Chief Whip’s office … colleagues, some shadow ministers, with 5,000 majorities … who are terrified Ukip will defeat them, or … hand seats to the Tories. 'We had nothing to say in the Middleton by-election on immigration, which was a big issue.’ It’s hardly surprising Labour MPs had no ammunition on immigration. Miliband ‘forgot’ to mention it in his conference speech – along with the deficit. His close-knit kitchen cabinet of aides and advisers are still in denial about the extent of the Ukip threat. Utterly sycophantic, they often greet him with applause even after a badly received speech, and there are plenty of those. Huddled in their bunker, they are as out of touch with Labour MPs as Miliband is with voters in the party’s heartlands. Bizarrely, he has viewed the rise of Ukip solely as a problem for the Tories, even though Nigel Farage’s party have come second to Labour in five by-elections in this parliament. There is pressure for Miliband to hand caretaker leadership to the likes of former Home Secretary Alan Johnson . Heywood and Middleton was only 148th on Ukip’s list of targets. In his conference speech, Miliband made only one reference to Nigel Farage’s party by mocking David Cameron for caring more about Ukip than the UK. But the joke is now on him. Confidence is draining from Miliband. He sounded tetchy and rattled in interviews yesterday and looked tired. He is braced for a difficult weekend with more MPs making public attacks. The problem is that in a party once synonymous with flat caps and coal miners, one in four Labour MPs used to work at Westminster, with no experience of the real world. One shadow cabinet member who defended Miliband on the radio was overheard saying afterwards: ‘I have been trying for so long to get Ed’s team to do something about our core voters to stop Ukip, but it’s not getting through.’ Miliband is losing authority over his shadow cabinet. The New Statesman reported yesterday that he wanted to cut university tuition fees to £6,000. But the magazine was briefed that Miliband had been blocked from making the change by shadow cabinet members. Earlier, shadow chancellor Ed Balls said it was a ‘mistake’ for Miliband to omit the deficit in his conference speech. The truth is Miliband is now a lame duck leader, a prisoner of his shadow cabinet and the trade unions. Labour MPs panicking about their seats have only got themselves to blame for not doing anything about him when they had the chance. It’s too late to get rid of him now – unless the big beasts of the party make him an offer he can’t refuse.","Ministers pledge Miliband loyalty in public in private it is a different story .

"Apple's holiday season proved to be a disappointment even though the company sold an all-time record number of iPhones and iPads during its latest quarter that ended on December 28. The fiscal first-quarter earnings released on Monday topped analyst . projections, but Apple sold fewer iPhones than Wall Street had been . anticipating. Management also forecast revenue for the current quarter that fell below analysts' predictions - despite moving 51 million iPhones, 26 million iPads and 4.8 million Macs.

By the end of after-hours extended trading, the shares had plummeted further putting the total loss at almost 9 per cent . Those letdowns caused Apple's stock to shed $41.62, or more than 7.5 percent, to $508.88 in extended trading after the release of results. The company sold 51 million iPhones during the three months ending just after Christmas. That marked a 7 percent increase from the previous record of nearly 48 million iPhones set a year earlier.

"Sophie Hemming savoured a memorable career highlight four years ago, despite the painful conclusion, but the England prop hopes it will be surpassed over the coming days. It was across the road from the country’s rugby HQ that the Bristol tighthead and her team-mates strove to break Kiwi dominance of the women’s World Cup, only to fall agonisingly short in the final with a 13-10 defeat. Now, with New Zealand dramatically out of the running, Gary Street’s side lock horns with Ireland in Paris on Wednesday evening and are aiming to reach their fourth consecutive tournament final. Big chance: Sophie Hemming (centre) believes England will have to be at their best to beat Ireland . United: The England team huddles in training to talk tactics ahead of their World Cup semi-final against Ireland . On Tuesday, after being named in a line-up featuring six starting changes, Hemming, 34, recalled the encounter against the Black Ferns which England hope to trump by winning Wednesday’s semi-final and claiming their coveted prize at a sold-out Stade Jean Bouin on Sunday. ‘I will always remember the 2010 World Cup final against New Zealand,’ she said. ‘I can picture standing there at The Stoop, feeling an incredible bond with my team-mates and the supporters in the crowd. We faced the Haka and the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end because the whole stadium erupted into a chant of Swing Low. ‘It was just a great experience to be with my team-mates that day, trying to achieve something special. The result didn’t go the way we wanted, but we’re in this environment again and hopefully we are ready to do something special this time around.’ IRELAND V ENGLAND . Kick-off: 5pm, Stade Jean Bouin, Paris. TV and Radio: LIVE on Sky Sports 4 and BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra . The World Cup has attracted record TV viewing figures and big crowds and, asked if the England side have sensed heightened interest, Hemming said: ‘Absolutely. Having the World Cup in London in 2010 really put the foundations in place and grabbed people’s attention. The 2012 Olympics was great for showcasing women’s sport and we are riding the wave I guess. ‘We are here to bring the trophy home, but if we can do some good for women’s rugby in France, in the UK and around the world, raising the profile and showing what a brilliant sport it is, that would be brilliant.’ Semi-finalists: England topped their group, Pool A, with two emphatic wins and a 13-13 draw with Canada . Tough test: England can reach the final of the Women's Rugby World Cup if they beat Ireland on Wednesday . A major catalyst for the enhanced interest in the women’s game was Ireland’s feat in condemning New Zealand to a shock pool-stage defeat which ultimately knocked them out of the World Cup. England will be wary of fired-up, familiar foes who beat them last year. ‘We know Ireland quite well and they know us quite well,’ said Hemming. ‘I play at Bristol with Claire Molloy, their No 7, and Larissa Muldoon, who is a scrum-half. A couple of years ago, I also played club rugby with their hooker, Gill Bourke. ‘Ireland came out firing against New Zealand and were massively up for it. They had never played them before and rose to the occasion. They mustn’t be underestimated — we know how strong they can be after they beat us in the Six Nations in 2013. ‘They have a very good kicking game so we have to keep our discipline and we know they have a strong driving lineout so we’ve been doing work to counter that.

Juninho, who spent eight years in Europe at Lyon, has been invited to Italy’s training base two hours west of Rio de Janeiro to meet Pirlo, who wrote in his autobiography how he would spend hours scrutinising the Brazilian’s free-kick technique. ‘That man made the ball do some quite extraordinary things,’ wrote Pirlo. ‘He never went wrong.

He has been sacked from his job after breaking a glass panel on a drinks machine . The father of Rickie Lambert, pictured arriving in Brazil ahead of the World Cup, has been fired from his warehouse job, it has been revealed . A former workmate said Ray is due to fly out to Brazil next week with wife Maureen, 57, to watch his son in action at the World Cup. He was said to be ‘fuming’ over his dismissal from his £20,000-a-year job and is considering an appeal. The former colleague, who asked not to be named, said: 'It's a joke. Loads of people give that machine a nudge when it doesn’t work properly. 'But to sack him for something as trivial as that was pathetic. 'Ray’s worked at that warehouse ever since it opened. He had put his money into the vending machine to buy the coffee but the cup got lodged in the machine. 'He gave it a little shove to try and dislodge it but accidentally broke the glass panel.'It wasn’t done with any malice. It had got stuck and he was trying to get it out.' But Matalan said there had been 'substantial damage to company property'. Matalan, where Mr Lambert worked, say 'substantial damage' was caused to company property (file picture) A Matalan spokeswoman said: 'Matalan confirms that an employee was recently dismissed from the company following an act of gross misconduct involving substantial damage to company property. 'Matalan takes its responsibility as an employer very seriously and has conducted this dismissal in accordance with the company’s disciplinary policy.' Mr Lambert is understood to have worked for Matalan for ten years, first at the company’s headquarters at Skelmersdale and then at the Knowsley warehouse. The couple live in a modest terraced home less than half a mile from the warehouse. The colleague added: 'He didn’t deliberately smash the glass. 'He’s got lots of friends at the warehouse and is popular among his colleagues. Ray Lambert and his wife Maureen are due to fly out to Brazil to watch their son Rickie Lambert, pictured with the ball against England's recent clash with Ecuador . 'He likes to work even though his son is a millionaire and he doesn’t have to. 'Rickie may have just signed to Liverpool for £4m but Ray has always been keen to stand on his own two feet. 'He and Maureen are desperately proud of what Rickie has achieved and I am sure that this will not destroy their trip to the World Cup.' Lambert signed a two-year-deal with boyhood club Liverpool earlier this month having starred for Southampton in the Premier League in the past two seasons. His parents plan to fly out to Brazil to watch him play in England’s last two group games against Uruguay and Costa Rica.

"Cristiano Ronaldo has caused concern in the Portugal camp ahead of their crucial World Cup opener against Germany after leaving training early with an ice pack attached to his left knee. The Real Madrid maestro is relied upon in the Portugal team, but the 29-year-old's campaign could have taken a hit if the injury that bothered him at Real Madrid has made its way to Brazil. Ronaldo managed less than 20 minutes with the rest of his team-mates before being forced to leave. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ronaldo cuts short his training with Portugal due to precaution .

Ronaldo reportedly signed shirts, met fans and stretched out before taking a seat on the bench while his team-mates continued with their drills. The 2014 Ballon d'Or winner was out of action for two weeks with tendinitis in the knee before the World Cup - an injury which had been largely kept secret. A return of that would come as a major blow to manager Paulo Bento so close to the tournament. It is hoped Ronaldo, who did not look in pain, will be able to start in Portugal's opener but the extent of his fitness is yet to be seen.

"Spain defender Sergio Ramos is refusing to wallow in the pain of Friday’s 5-1 drubbing by Holland and will use it instead as a motivation for their next game. The world champions cannot afford to lose against Chile at the Maracana on Wednesday and Ramos insists their Dutch horror show will help them. ‘I’m not going to spend another second thinking about that match,’ said the Real Madrid defender, who was given the runaround by Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben.

The Chelsea striker said: ‘Your opponents know you have to win. You can’t afford to draw and they’ll try to make the most of any anxiety we might have.’ Ramos dismissed suggestions that Spain were at a disadvantage against Holland because they had been training in the milder south for a match in steamy Salvador. ‘We are training here in good temperatures, in good conditions and with good facilities,’ he said. ‘If we’d won, you wouldn’t be talking about this subject.’ After his howler against Holland on Friday night, calls have grown in Spain for manager Vicentre Del Bosque to drop keeper Iker Casillas.

"The 18-year-old will ride Ed Dunlop-trained horse . Red Galileo is priced at 125-1 to win Saturday's prestigious Flat race . Murphy has ridden 84 winners and is based with Berkshire trainer Andrew Balding . Twelve months after working at Epsom’s Investec Derby meeting as a stable lad, apprentice sensation Oisin Murphy will ride in the world’s most prestigious Flat race on Saturday after being booked for Ed Dunlop-trained Red Galileo. Murphy has little chance of winning the prestigious mile-and-a-half race on the 125-1 rank outsider but the 18-year-old’s booking is another sign of his meteoric rise through the jockey ranks. The mount on Red Galileo will be only the second he has had in a group one race, the first arriving just over an hour earlier on William Knight-trained Beacon Lady in the Coronation Cup. Star quality: Teenage jockey Oisin Murphy, pictured (gold cap) winning on Hot Streak at Haydock last Saturday, will ride Red Galileo at the Epsom Derby . The youngest jockey to win the Derby was 16-year-old John Parsons, who won the 1862 race on Caractacus.Lester Piggott was 18 when he won the first of his nine Derbies on Never Say Die in 1954.Walter Swinburn was a year older when he romped home on Shergar in 1981, the same age as Mickael Barzalona (Pour Moi, 2011) and Joseph O’Brien (Camelot, 2012). This time last year, the Irish teenager who is a nephew of Cheltenham Gold Cup-winning jockey and trainer Jim Culloty, had had only a handful of race rides and was still awaiting his first winner. Murphy, who has now ridden 84 winners including 13 in Australia in the Winter, is based with Berkshire trainer Andrew Balding, brother of C4 racing anchor Clare Balding. He shot to prominence with a headline grabbing 9,260-1 four-timer, including Highland Colori in the Ayr Gold Cup, in September. His 28 winners this season make Murphy clear leader in the 2014 apprentice jockey race and he is on course to lose his apprentice weight allowance in record time. Dunlop and owner Ronnie Arculli were persuaded to use Murphy after watching his winning performance on sprinter Hot Streak in last month’s Group Two Temple Stakes at Haydock. Murphy said: ‘It is a great opportunity and good of Mr Dunlop and the owner the chance. It is genuinely beyond my wildest dreams. The Derby and the Arc are the two biggest races in the world. It is unbelievable.This time last year I hadn’t ridden a winner. Sealed with a kiss: Murphy, 18, was all smiles after he landed the Ayr Gold Cup . ‘I led up Here Comes When (on Oaks day) at Epsom last year. I experienced the atmosphere a little bit but it will be very different this time. ‘I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to ride Hot Streak and it is unbelievable that one chance just leads on to another. ‘I have one ride for Mr Dunlop before.’ Dunlop added: ‘We had a list of possible jockeys and watching him win the Temple Stakes, the decision was made to book Oisin. ‘He has got a ride in the Coronation Cup earlier in the day which will be good experience.’ Red Galileo has run twice this year, finishing fourth behind Western Hymn in the Sandown Classic Trial and sixth to Snow Sky in the Lingfield Derby Trial. Murphy cut his teeth on Ireland’s Pony Racing as well as regularly riding the jump horses of Culloty, best known as the jockey of three-time Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Best Mate. Waitng game: Frankie Dettori's hopes of not missing out on the race for a third consecutive year now appear to hinge on Aidan O'Brien offering him the mount on one of his four entries not chosen by son Joseph and Ryan Moore . Murphy has jumped fences during schooling sessions on Lord Windermere, the winner of the Gold Cup for his uncle in March. Red Galileo had been one of the few remaining riding options in the Derby for Frankie Dettori. The Italian’s hopes of not missing out on the race for a third consecutive year now appear to hinge on Aidan O’Brien offering him the mount on one of his four entries not chosen by son Joseph and Ryan Moore. Irish jockey Kevin Manning, who won the race in 2008 on New Approach but endured a torrid time on hard-pulling, well-beaten favourite Dawn Approach 12 months ago, rides Charlie Appleby’s Godolphin-owned Lingfield Trial third Sudden Wonder. Andrea Atzeni missed his three rides at Yarmouth on Tuesday night after a heavy fall at Windsor on Monday. He should return on Thursday and is first Derby mount, Kingston Hill, continues to attract support, being clipped to 8-1 third favourite by Coral.","The 18-year-old will ride Ed Dunlop-trained horse .

"World Cup winner Lucio is tipping the Chelsea factor to help Brazil lift the trophy again on home soil this summer. Lucio, part of the last Brazil side to be world champions in 2002, thinks Felipe Scolari has pulled off a masterstroke by including four of Jose Mourinho’s players last season in his squad – Ramires, David Luiz, Oscar and Willian. The big defender says it is a big advantage because the weekly intensity of the Premier League will help them cope with the pressure of being tournament favourites. Star man: Lucio is tipping Chelsea's Oscar to shine for Brazil at the World Cup . ‘Of course, the four of them are in the squad because of their quality as individuals. But I also believe the fact that they play together helps because they understand each other,’ said Lucio, who now plays his club football in Brazil for Palmeiras. ‘The Premier League is one of the hardest in the world with plenty of great teams like Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal. ‘It makes the games really hard and gives great credibility to those players, a great experience. I think being used to playing at that level is very important for a World Cup. ‘Chelsea is a great team and for me Oscar is the player who can make the difference in a match. He’s a very offensive player; fast, creative, skilful. He can make a difference for Brazil.’ Midfield maestro: Ramires (left) sidesteps Neymar during Brazil training last week . Head boy: David Luiz beats Jo in the air as Brazil prepare for Thursday's game with Croatia . Steady on lads! Willian and David Luiz haven't held back in training during the past few weeks . Ironically, Chelsea have only two players in the England squad compared to their quartet of Brazilians – Frank Lampard and Gary Cahill. Luiz is officially a Chelsea player until the end of the month when the transfer window re-opens and he joins Paris St Germain. Lucio’s World Cup-winning side included star names like Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Rivaldo and Roberto Carlos. He played for Bayer Leverkusen at the time – they had lost the Champions League final to Real Madrid just before  the World Cup – and cemented his reputation as the best centre-half in the world in Japan and Korea. ‘My favorite memory is from the final, when we beat Germany 2-0, to become champions. I was only 24 but knew it was such a great accomplishment, it would go down in history. Still going: Lucio is now playing for Palmeiras back in Brazil at the age of 36 . Mainstay: Lucio was an integral part of the Brazil squad that won the 2002 World Cup . ‘I believe this year, the advantage of playing at home will be decisive. Everything is going to be on our side, and the history of Brazil in the World Cup and the quality of our players will help a lot. Brazil has a great chance. ‘The current team has different qualities to my 2002 side even though it has the same manager, Scolari. It would be a hard match between the two – I think it would be a draw! Lucio is still stopped every day in football-mad Brazil about his World Cup triumph. ‘It doesn’t happen to many players because the World Cup is only every four years, so people still congratulate me and ask what it was like. ‘They also ask me if Ronaldinho’s winning goal against England was intentional! It’s difficult to answer but Ronaldinho said after the game that he meant to go for goal because the goalkeeper (David Seaman) used to leave his position many times.' Lucio has endorsed Skills from Brazil (published, Scholastic Press), a children’s football book to encourage boys and girls to read .","Midfielder 'can make a difference for Brazil' says defender .

"A 52-year-old man may never walk again after being thrown off his bicycle and into a sinkhole, where he lay through the night. David Keys, from Waihi in Hauraki District in the North Island of New Zealand, heard his neck snap as he landed in the one-metre deep hole at Morgan Park in Waihi on Wednesday evening. He fell in and out of consciousness as he lay in the hole, waiting for someone to discover him. David Keys, 52, may never walk again after being thrown off his bike and into a sinkhole . Before the bike ride, Mr Keys searched for his headlamp but did not find it - he went riding anyway. His brother Ian Keys said since it was still daylight, David thought it would be fine to ride around the park with his dog,Stuff New Zealand reported. 'He was totally unaware of the hole being here', Ian said. The hole was hidden by shrubs off the edge of the park's car-park. Ian said his brother was only doing 5-kilometres per hour when he hit the hole, causing him to fly over the handlebars. 'People were still on the netball courts but he couldn't call for help because he could barely breathe', Ian said. 'He lay on his bike... He watched them turn the lights out at the netball court and everyone go home and he knew he would going to be in for a long night'. Mr Keys layed in the one-metre deep hole over night, drifting in and out of consciousness, unable to move or call for help . A Hauraki District Council worker discovered David at 4:15am on Friday. By then David was severely injured and suffering from hypothermia. Auckland-based Westpac rescue helicopter flew David to Auckland City Hospital before being transferred to Middlemore Hospital, where he underwent a three-hour operation to fix together bones in his neck. 'He's paralysed from the neck down', Ian said. David's family and doctors fear he could be 'a quadriplegic for the rest of his life'. Amber Keys, David's niece describes her uncle as an 'active and fit person' with a 'passion for hunting'. She said not being able to walk again will not only affect David, but the people around him. Langley Cavers, CEO of Hauraki Council said the council had no idea that the sinkhole existed and has since been sealed off to prevent another accident. 'Typically when we become aware of them we will fill them,' Mr Cavers said. He said the council are thinking of the David and his family during this awful time. 'It's a tragedy', Mr Cavers said.

"The Georgia Supreme Court has overturned a murder conviction for man who beat his wife to death with a baseball bat because evidence of the woman having an affair wasn't allowed into the trial. The court said Monday that evidence of James Lynn Jr.'s wife having an affair would have corroborated his testimony that the woman told him she was cheating on him just before she was killed. Lynn, of Winder, admitted to killing Tonya Lynn and was sentenced to life without parole. He argued that he was guilty of voluntary manslaughter and was provoked. Crime of passion? The Georgia Supreme court said Monday that evidence of James Lynn Jr.'s wife Tonya having an affair would have corroborated his testimony that the woman told him she was cheating on him just before she was killed . Officials say Lynn testified during his trial that the two were arguing in July 2011 when Tonya Lynn told him that she was cheating on him with a former lover and a co-worker. 'We think that proof that Tonya really was having affairs … would tend to make it more likely that she, just as (Lynn) testified, told him of those affairs in the minutes before he killed her,' read the opinion. 'As such, proof of the recent affairs…is relevant in this case, and the trial court erred when it concluded otherwise.' In Georgia, a slaying may be ruled as voluntary manslaughter if the killer 'acts solely as the result of a sudden, violent and irresistible passion resulting from serious provocation sufficient to excite such passion in a reasonable person' reports the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Scene: Lynn dumped his wife down a 20 to 30 foot well and then tried convincing his family she'd run off . Tonya was found in the well about 20 to 30 feet below ground in July 2011. Police had said they began investigating after relatives reported the 38-year-old woman missing after Lynn apparently sent his wife's niece a text message to make it appear that she'd run off. Friends and family had become alarmed when the mother didn't show up for work at an Athens hospital. An autopsy found that she died of injuries from blunt force trauma. The couple had four children children together. The case will now go back to Superior Court for a possible retrial. Shattered family: The couple had four children together.

"A minicab driver who claimed he was earning just £700 a month but was living a luxury of life in his Nigerian mansion, has been ordered to pay almost £1.2million. Ovo Mayomi and his wife Juliet Ubiribo were convicted of fraud in 2010 after using an identity and immigration scam to falsely claim £43,000 in benefits. Mayomi, 44, claimed he was earning £700 a month and was living in Croydon, south London, while his wife, 32, claimed benefits after telling benefit bosses she was a single mother and a victim of domestic violence. Fraud: Ovo Mayomi, 44, left, claimed he was earning . £700 a month and living in Croydon, south London. His wife Juliet . Ubiribo, 32, right, told benefit bosses she was a single mother and a victim of . domestic violence . But fraud investigators found Mayomi . and his wife were actually living in a large luxurious house in Lekki near the Nigerian city Lagos worth more than £1million . complete with chandeliers and £89,000 worth of sound equipment. He also . had a £25,000 watch. His wife wore a Rolex watch and drove a Mercedes . Sport Coupi. Now a judge has ordered Mayomi to pay £1,197,743.54 in a confiscation order under the Proceeds Of Crime Act, or go to prison for six years. As well as two money-transferring . businesses and bank accounts, investigators also discovered Mayomi owned . a fish farm in the country. The couple's benefit scam unravelled when a visa application by Mayomi showed they had married a year . earlier and that Ubiribo had a job in order to support him.

All mod cons: The mansion was found to be equipped with £89,000 worth of sound equipment . Ubiribo also asked the council to rehouse her because she was the victim of domestic violence. However, . the telephone number she gave revealed the man she named as her . landlord - Ayiomike Neburagho - was, in fact, her husband Mayomi using a . false identity. At a police interview, Mayomi . admitted that while living in Nigeria he had bought the identity of . Ayiomike Matthew Neburagho and had entered the UK as him. Mayomi was also shown a wedding photograph of himself, using the Neburagho identity, marrying a Nigerian woman in the UK. He admitted he was the groom in the wedding photo but he said he was 'just standing in for someone'. Ubiribo and Mayomi pleaded guilty to all charges. Mayomi was jailed for 30 months two years ago and his wife was sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for two years. She was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of community service and be under curfew for four months from 9pm to 6am. Court orders were signed freezing . their assets in the UK and abroad in 2010, and an investigation was . launched to find out how much the Nigerian-born couple had gained from . their criminal lifestyle and what the extent of their assets was. Mayomi, of Ashburton, disputed the . results of the assets investigation, and a subsequent four-day . confiscation hearing took place at Croydon Crown Court. Imposing: This photograph shows a vast hallway inside Mayomi's Nigerian home . Mansion: The house was fitted with pricey sound equipment, chandeliers, and a vast, contemporary kitchen .

A visa application by her husband . showed Ubiribo had a job . in order to support him . On Friday, Judge Nicholas Ainley . ruled that Mayomi must pay £1,197,743.54 by 14 March next year. It is . one of the largest confiscation orders carried out by a council.

Councillor Dudley Mead, deputy leader . of the council, said: 'This is a landmark case for Croydon as it is the . first time the council’s in-house financial investigator has pursued a . major confiscation order of this nature. 'Usually . these cases are dealt with by the police rather than local authorities. It is rare for councils to have their own in-house investigator, so it . is to the anti-fraud team’s immense credit that it is pioneering the way . forward in reclaiming the proceeds of crime. 'As . a result of our investigator’s fine work, the council expects to be . able to claw back as much as £400,000 in taxpayers’ money. 'This . case should serve as a clear warning that crime does not pay. Croydon . Council will always prosecute in fraud cases and seek to recover money . or assets wherever they are.

"This is the moment a man climbed out of a sidewalk grate and hurled a smoke bomb into a crowded New York restaurant where actress Rose McGowan was dining. Dressed in a baseball cap and a stars-and-stripes t-shirt, the white blond man is seen pulling himself onto the street clutching the firework in his right hand - before lobbing it into celebrity hot spot Bar Pitti. He then disappears from sight. Rose McGowan was among the dozens of diners seen fleeing the Greenwich Village restaurant at around 5.45pm  as red smoke flooded the patio area. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The young man look out from the grate before hurling the smoke bomb at the restaurant . Here the moment he hurled the makeshift firework into celebrity hot spot Bar Pitti is captured on video . The grate is used as an emergency exit for subway passengers.

Officials are now hunting for a white blond male around 20 years old. Panic: Diners, including actress Rose McGowan, fled the patio as red smoke flooded the area at 5.45pm . Disappeared: The assailant then disappeared - seemingly down the grate - as police were called to the scene . The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is investigating how the man had managed to get to the exit . According to the New York Times, police said the smoke bomb was a 'commercially made pyrotechnic smoke generalizer that emitted a red smoke'.

'We take security of our system very seriously, and we will take all necessary steps to secure our system,' he said.

"Roy Hodgson thanked the people of Manaus for the fabulous welcome they afforded England but his players had to abandon a stroll in the park yesterday because they were mobbed by well wishers. Hodgson said: 'Our trip to the supermarket... the shopping mall, I mean, we thought it might be nice for the players to get out and see the place, but the mobbing was so much we had to abort the trip.' Captain Steven Gerrard added: 'There wasn't any shopping getting done. We went for a morning stroll, that's all, mixing with the locals. But the serious stuff starts now.'

On target: Daniel Sturridge during training for England in the Amazonia stadium in Manaus . Hodgson claimed the pitch looked 'flat' and 'fine' as England trained in the stadium. It was watered before the session and definitely seemed greener than it had 24 hours earlier, when ground staff appeared to be spraying it with powder or paint. The players were relieved to see there was no sun on the pitch late in the afternoon. Saturday's game kicks off at 6pm local time. Hodgson also insisted there had never been a great concern about playing in the Amazon city even though he said before the draw that he would prefer to avoid Manaus. 'Sometimes interpretation comes out the wrong way,' said the England boss. 'If there was any damage had been perceived, it's been cleared up. 'I've met the mayor and the governor, had good talks and discussions... We wanted to play in the World Cup, to play in Brazil, and to play where we were told. I can't believe the friendliness of the people, their enthusiasm. Manager: Roy Hodgson says he 'can't believe the friendliness of the people' in Manaus during England's stay . 'We're not concerned about the heat. We'll take the conditions that come our way. We've prepared for them and aren't making contingency plans. We'll play the game we want to play. 'We'll keep a close eye on the players. If any of them are flagging late on, we'll change them. We have players who can come on and change the game. 'We are physically fit, mentally fit and tactically prepared. That's the most we can ever hope for.' Gerrard said: 'It's obviously warm. It'll be a tough game. Italy are a fantastic team.

"Defending champions Exeter made it two wins from as many matches in the LV= Cup after coming from behind to beat Bath 18-6 in front of a record Sandy Park crowd of 11,785. Gavin Henson and his opposite number Gareth Steenson exchanged first-half penalties before the former added a second after the break to give Bath a 6-3 lead. But tries in the final quarter from Carl Rimmer, converted by Steenson, and Moray Low gave the Chiefs back-to-back west country victories to remain top of Pool Four. Gareth Steenson of Exeter Chiefs kicks a last minute penalty during the LV= Cup match against Bath . Despite having one eye on Friday night’s trip to Franklins Gardens to face Aviva Premiership leaders Northampton, Exeter fielded a full strength side and gave a debut to Scotland A international full-back Byron McGuigan. The visitors made six changes from the side that beat London Welsh 47-7 last weekend with lock Dominic Day back from injury, while full-back Luke Arscott was returning to Sandy Park for his first encounter against his former club. Former Wales international Henson got the visitors off to a perfect start with a 15-metre penalty from in front of the posts after two minutes. Henson then saw his long range drop goal charged down by Chiefs’ skipper Dean Mumm. Fly-half Henson looked to have set-up Bath for the opening try midway through the half with a neat grubber kick through but new signing McGuigan was on hand to beat outside centre Matt Banahan to the touchdown. Despite having a number of players away on international duty, it was Bath who were doing all the attacking until the Chiefs came back into the game for the final 10 minutes of the half as they camped out on the Bath line. Carl Rimmer of Exeter Chiefs goes over for the opening try during the LV= Cup match . But the visitors’ defence stood firm and scrum-half Micky Young snatched a loose ball to feed wing Olly Woodbury, who eased the pressure as he kicked the ball into touch deep in the Chiefs half. Five minutes before the break Bath were penalised for not following away at the tackle just outside their own 22 and fly-half Steenson slotted his kick from out wide on the right to level the scores. Bath wasted little time getting back into the game after half-time when wing Richard Lane burst through a slack defence only to be stopped just short of the line. Henson nudged the visitors ahead 13 minutes into the second half with a perfectly struck kick 12 metres inside the Chiefs half and close to the right touchline but saw a second attempt, just inside the opposition half, hit the cross bar. Don Armand of Exeter Chiefs stretches for the line out during the LV= Cup match . On the hour mark Exeter won a penalty for a scrum infringement, after Lane knocked-on, and they kicked to the corner. From the catch and drive replacement prop Rimmer crossed the line and Steenson converted. With less than five minutes to play the Chiefs were again camped out on the Bath line after a steal from flanker Dom Armand. They battered the visitors’ defence until replacement prop Low crossed for his first try for the Chiefs . Steenson’s conversion from outside on the left sailed just past the wrong side of the bear upright but he added a penalty from 22 metres out with the last kick off the game.","Defending champions Exeter make it two wins from two in LV= Cup .

"The federal government has approved air combat operations in Iraq to fight Islamic State extremists. The decision to send in Super Hornets as part of a US-led mission came after a meeting of the national security committee and cabinet in Canberra on Friday. 'Today cabinet has authorised Australian air strikes in Iraq at the request of the Iraqi government in support of the Iraqi government,' Prime Minister Tony Abbott said. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott (right) and defence force chief Air Marshal Mark Binskin during a press conference at Parliament House to announce the approval of air combat operations in Iraq . F/A-18F Super Hornet aircrew head to their aircraft in preparation for departure to the Middle East from RAAF Base Amberley last week in Amberley, Australia . 'Also, subject to final legal documentation, cabinet has authorised the deployment of Australian special forces into Iraq to advise and assist Iraqi forces.' Six Super Hornets, a Wedgetail surveillance aircraft, a KC-30 refueller and a special forces contingent have been pre-deployed to the United Arab Emirates. Australia ended its military commitment to Iraq in July 2009, after six years of war involving more than 20,000 personnel. He warned the mission would be 'quite lengthy' and would be months rather than weeks. 'I want to assure the Australian people this will be as long as it needs to be, and as short as it possibly can be,' he said. Only Iraq can defeat IS, but Iraq shouldn't and won't be alone, Mr Abbott said. Mr Abbott warned it would be a dangerous mission. But he's confident the Defence Force has all possible measures to minimise risk in place. RAAF aircraft set to participate in attacks on Islamic State  jihadists have conducted their first training missions in the Middle East region . 'It is a combat deployment, but it is an essentially humanitarian mission to protect the people of Iraq and ultimately the people of Australia from the murderous rage of the ISIL death cult,' Mr Abbott said. 'It is absolutely in Australia's national interests that this mission go ahead.' Mr Abbott says Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has given his full support. Defence Minister David Johnston said the Iraqi government was 'gratefully welcoming' of Australia's role. 'The skill, commitment and professionalism of our uniform personnel is simply first class,' he said. 'They will do a very good job for us.' Defence Force chief Mark Binskin said the air task group and commando unit were 'potent'. 'The team is well trained, they're well equipped, they're well prepared,' Air Chief Marshal Binskin said. 'The air traffic group's been flying supporting missions and some training missions over Iraq for the last couple of days and we're ready to get on with the job.' The prime minister again refused to rule out potential involvement in Syria and cautioned against trying to predict future missions. 'Let's focus on what's being done today rather than speculate on what might be done in months or years to come,' he said. Success would be evident when the Iraqi government was restoring control over its own cities and towns and when IS was in retreat. 'If we could degrade them to the point where they no longer existed that would be obviously the best possible result.' But Mr Abbott warned that Australia was not at war. 'I know that you'd love to have that headline, but it's not strictly accurate,' he told reporters. 'Yes, we are engaged in combat operations. But these are combat operations against an insurgency in support of the legitimate government of Iraq. 'We're not trying to build liberal pluralism in Iraq, we're not trying to create a shining city on a hill.'","Tony Abbott said the federal cabinet had approved combat flights in Iraq .

"For many couples, space from one another is a vital part of a healthy relationship. But for one couple who live in the West Village in  New York space is simply not an option because their tiny apartment  measures just 242 square foot. Despite this, Jourdan Lawlor and her boyfriend Tobin Ludwig have become used to moving the couch out of the way before they can go to bed every night. Scroll down for video .

Time for bed: When Ludvig pulls the bed down it has a duvet on it already which helps to save time making it up . Murphy bed: The couple have to move a couch to put down their Murphy bed, seen here, . The couple have a fold out 'Murphy bed' literally next to their front door. And when they decide to go to sleep, they have to  move the couch before they can pull the bed down, which has a duvet and pillow on it already made up. The cramped property also features a little bathroom with a door made from reclaimed wood on barn door sliders. Meanwhile, the kitchen, which takes up most of the leftover space, features an oven, a 'big' mini fridge, pots and pans hanging from the ceiling and a wooden table where they put a bowl of fruit. The limited space means that the couple have to plan their meals very carefully. 'We really only shop for one or two meals at a time, no Costco trips in this house!' Ludwig told ABC 7 News. In the space that's left, they have a minuscule walk-in closet and a tiny attic above the bath. 'So we're renting that [attic] now on Craigslist for $275-a-week, if anyone's interested!' Ludwig joked.

'Then you squeeze,' he adds, as he moves to the back of the table to sit down . Marriage: The couple plan to get married on New Year's Eve after living in very close proximity to each other . The bathroom and kitchen were redone as a part of a $33,000 renovation on the apartment which they bought three years ago for $270,000. In previous years, the apartment used to be used as a dorm for Hudson River dock workers. However, their small living unit  is not the city's smallest pad. A studio in Manhattan's Upper West Side is just 90 square foot and measures 12 feet by 7 feet. It is being rented by Felice Cohen who pays just over $700 per month for her microstudio in an area where the average rent for an apartment is $3,600 per month. And while living in such close proximity could have spelled disaster for this couple's relationship, it appears to have worked out well for them as they plan to get married in the New Year. Lawlor said: 'We plan to get married on New Year's Eve.

"A new study has revealed that children placed in childcare centres are more likely to develop hyperactive and aggressive behaviours than those who spend time in home care. 3200 children were monitored by researchers from the University of Adelaide. The researches studied the children, who came from all over Australia,  following time they had spent in different types of care up to age three. A new study has revealed that children placed in childcare centres are more likely to develop hyperactive and aggressive behaviours than those who spend time in home care . Their results, which were based on surveys filled out by parents and teachers, found the length of time spent in childcare centres was directly linked to increases in problem behaviours by the age of four or five. Interestingly, children who spent more time in family day care or under the care of nannies did not show increased signs of problem behaviours. University of Adelaide PhD student Angela Gialamas says children who spent time in childcare centres were more likely to be restless, easily distracted and aggressive towards others. But they were also less likely to be anxious or depressed than children who did not attend childcare, Ms Gialamas said. Their results, which were based on surveys filled out by parents and teachers, found the length of time spent in childcare centres was directly linked to increases in problem behaviours by the age of four or five . ""These children were less likely to be reported by parents and teachers as being unhappy and withdrawn,"" she told reporters on Wednesday. ""That may relate to childcare centres having more same-aged peers than any other type of child care setting."" Ms Gialamas said further research was required to determine why children placed in childcare centres were more likely to develop problem behaviours.

"Cardiff Blues have confirmed that Sam Warburton will miss Friday's friendly against Exeter as a result of the civil war blighting Welsh rugby. Warburton is stuck in limbo by the ongoing dispute between the Welsh Rugby Union and regions and will now miss the opening match of pre-season at Cardiff Arms Park. The British and Irish Lions captain is the only player centrally contracted to the WRU and cannot be selected until a new participation agreement is reached between the warring parties. Missing: Sam Warburton will not play for Cardiff Blues against Exeter on Friday . The Blues travel to Leicester on August 29 for their final friendly before RaboDirect PRO 12 action begins against Zebre nine days later. 'Until the services agreement has been sorted we unfortunately can't pick Sam and so he won't be involved against Exeter,' Blues attack coach Paul John said. 'I've been told by the region that, at the moment, he is unable to play for us. 'Until everything is signed and sealed that will be the case. As soon as it is done we will crack on.' Warburton's inability to play will be particularly galling given that the Wales star is fit and available after recovering from the shoulder injury sustained during the Six Nations in March. There is little evidence to suggest the WRU and regions will reach an agreement any time soon, so flanker Warburton is facing the real prospect of watching the start of the competitive season from the sidelines. Tug of war: The Welsh captain is in the centre of a war between the WRU and the regions . 'Sam is training really well with us and this is probably one of the first pre-seasons he's had in a long while,' John said. 'He's been a big part of training with us this summer so hopefully things can get sorted and he can start playing. 'Sam was rehabbing with us at the start of the summer and now is back in training. 'I know (Blues defence coach) Dale McIntosh has spoken to (Wales coach) Warren Gatland about him and there is a plan in place in terms of when he can play and things like that.

"One in five people say they are too embarrassed to play sport or exercise with other people because they are so unfit (file picture) One in five people in the UK say they are too embarrassed to play sport or exercise with other people because they are too unfit. In addition, more than a quarter admit they find it hard to motivate themselves to play sport or get more exercise, according to a new survey. Despite this, more than a third of people polled said they would like to be more active to improve their health. The survey, carried out by consumer analysts Mintel, found that more than a third (36 per cent) of people have not played or participated in sport in the past 12 months. This rose to more than half of people aged 55-64 and to three out of five of those over 65. Women found it especially difficult to get up off the sofa. The survey found 41 per cent of women have not played sport in the past year, with a third agreeing that they find it hard to motivate themselves. Despite this, 44 per cent of women say they would like to be more active to improve their health. When it comes to locating the sportiest areas, those living in the South East and East Anglia are the most reluctant to feel the burn, with 40 per cent of people in these areas admitting they had not taken part in any sport in the past year. London boasts the sportiest residents, with only a third of people not having exercised in the past 12 months. The survey also questioned British people on their favourite sports. Swimming is the nation's favourite form of exercise, with almost a third (29 per cent) of people reporting that they had swum in the past year. Cycling came second, with 19 per cent of British people reporting getting their bike out in the last 12 months, and jogging came in third, with 17 per cent of people reporting they'd been for a run. When it comes to trying new sports, 44 per cent of Britons are interested in trying individual sports, 25 per cent outdoor or alternative sports and 22 per cent racquet sports. Although swimming comes top again, with 17 per cent interested in trying this in the future, it's yoga and Pilates that appears second on the list with 12 per cent of Britons interested in participating in this in the future, rising to 19 per cent of women. However, despite recent successes of UK female sport teams, women seem to be more reluctant to take up stereotypical male sports in the future, with just four per cent of women who haven't played sport in the past year interested in trying golf in the future. They showed even less interest in playing football (two per cent) and cricket (one per cent). In comparison, 10 per cent of men who haven't played sport in the last year said they would be interested in playing golf, 8 per cent interested in playing football and 7 per cent keen for a game of cricket. More than a third of Britons have not exercised or played sport in the past year, although 38 per cent would like to be more active (file picture) David Walmsley, senior leisure analyst at Mintel, said: 'Not feeling fit enough to play with others could be one expression of a more general lack of physical confidence that stems from unfamiliarity with sport more widely.' He added it was significant this attitude was most common among older people, who are least likely to take part in sport either individually or with others. 'However, the fact that it is also more common among people who play sport with other family members suggests promoting this type of play could be a useful means of breaking down these wider barriers. 'Playing with family offers a supportive setting in which people who have not played in many years can regain their confidence and enthusiasm for sport.' Nearly half of women say being more active would improve their health (file picture) Indeed, 21 per cent of Brits who have played sport with their family in the past year say they don’t feel fit enough to play sport or exercise with other people. However, Mintel's research shows that parents are the strongest cheerleaders for the importance of exercise. More than a third (38 per cent) of parents said they try to encourage their children to play sport to help them develop a healthy lifestyle. However, 55 per cent of this group agreed that playing sport or exercising regularly means you don't have to worry too much about what you eat. This was a lot higher than the national average for agreeing with this statement, which was 10 per cent. Perhaps unsurprisingly, British parents who encourage their children to play sport are the most likely to believe in the importance of group exercise. As many as 62 per cent agree that playing organised sport makes it easier to stick to a fitness or weight-loss programme than going to the gym or exercising alone, while an average of just 15 per cent of Britons agree this is true. Mr Walmsley added that parents advocating sport could help children stay healthy – and might even help them to be more active too. He said: 'High levels of recognition from parents of the health value of sport is positive for children's participation and could be a way of keeping children's weight in check without having to constantly police their diets.'","A quarter of Britons said they find it hard to motivate themselves to exercise .

"Neil Warnock plans to be more boring in the future to avoid any further Football Association raps. The Crystal Palace boss was fined £9,000 for comments he made about referee Craig Pawson following his side's defeat at Chelsea last month. The 65-year-old had a personal hearing on Wednesday after denying the charges after saying that Pawson had been 'influenced' by Chelsea players to send off Damien Delaney shortly after the Blues had seen Cesar Azpilicueta dismissed. Neil Warnock (right) was fined £9000 on Wednesday for his comments about a referee . Warnock has said he will be 'boring' when he speaks to the media after a game from now on . Warnock, who has not seen his side win since a 2-0 victory over Leicester on September 27, was also warned as to his future conduct and intends to steer clear of saying anything of note any time soon. ""I'm going to be boring from now on,"" he said. ""(I will) Give you nothing to write about. I know journalists appreciate my comments, but they are not the ones who pay the fines. ""The media is part of my job and I have a lot of acquaintances who are journalists and I know how hard they work, so I will always come out and do press conferences. ""You just have to learn about the timing of things with the TV. Twenty minutes after a game is very soon so you have to get your thoughts together."" Warnock's comments were made after Crystal Palace's 2-1 defeat to Chelsea in October . Warnock could have fallen foul of the FA for questioning decisions in the two matches either side of the Chelsea defeat, with the loss at Hull and a 2-2 draw at West Brom also seeing him question certain decisions. He then saw Palace lose 3-1 at home to Sunderland on Monday night in a game where the Eagles were denied at least one clear penalty. The former Sheffield United and Leeds boss reined in his comments following the defeat as he struggles to work out what would constitute an FA charge, having seen Swansea's Garry Monk avoid a fine for his remarks after a soft penalty was awarded in their game at Stoke. ""You have to watch what you say otherwise you are going to get fined,"" he added. ""What I said, I could have changed maybe two or three words and I wouldn't have got charged. ""My wife, for example, saw the Garry Monk thing and said, 'Don't you ever do anything like that or I will be mad at you'. I told her this week, 'But he didn't get charged, darling!""'

"Exeter Chiefs have handed lock forward Jerry Sexton, the younger brother of Ireland fly-half Johnny, a 14-week trial. The 21-year-old has until the end of November to win himself a full-time deal with the Aviva Premiership club. Head coach Rob Baxter has snapped up Ireland Under-20 graduate Sexton to offset the shoulder injury to club captain Dean Mumm. Chance to shine: Jerry Sexton has been given a 14-week trial to impress at Premiership club Exeter in Devon . Another Sexton: Jerry Sexton was released by French side Auch but will hope to earn a deal with Exeter . Sexton had hoped to remain in France after one season with Pro D2 side Auch, but failed to agree a new contract. 'My agent told me there was an opportunity to come to Exeter on trial because Dean Mumm was injured and that there was a possible place available,' he said. 'We sent the video across, the coaches had a look and now they've offered me a chance until November, so we'll see where it goes from there.' Lions star: Lock forward Jerry Sexton is the younger brother of British and Irish Lions star fly-half Johnny . Success: Johnny Sexton has had an illustrious club and country career with Leinster, Racing Metro and Ireland . Jerry Sexton followed his elder brother Johnny's lead in moving to France last summer, with the British and Irish Lions star still plying his trade at Racing Metro. The younger Sexton sibling revealed his vastly-experienced brother had urged him to take his chance with the Devon club. 'After Ireland Under-20s I was supposed to go to London Irish Academy on a three-year deal, but that fell through and then I went to France for a year and really enjoyed it,' he said. 'I was supposed to go back again this year, but then I had a problem with my contract so I ended up back home and then the trial with Exeter came up. 'I'm looking forward to it, my brother said the coaches here are very good and that there are no superstars within the squad. 'Already you can see the club is all about hard work and that's what I aim to do and hopefully get a chance to play.'","Lock forward has begun a 14-week trial with the Rugby Union side in Devon .

"The dreaded magpie swooping season is apon us, as the weather starts to warm up. Whether on a bike going for a ride, or walking your dog, magpies are looking for their next victim to attack, becoming increasingly aggressive during breeding season which lasts until October. But what are the best ways to  stop magpies from swooping? Breakfast announcer from Star FM Mildura's 99.5, Amber Wheatland tested out two theories and documented them on youtube, and it's definite to say one worked while the other miserably failed. Scroll down for video . The fake eyes clearly don't work : Amber's test two fails as a magpie angrily swoops her . AHHHHH! Panic sets in as Amber realises the magpie is coming straight for her . Magpies are known to start swooping in breeding season from August until late October. They become aggressive protecting their nest . For both test runs, Amber decided to get on her bike and ride down a magpie prone road, where she was knew she would encounter some fierce feathered behaviour. For test one it was the branches stuck in a helmet, strategy. A pretty scared Amber and wasn't sure if this would work, but was keen to try, and when she did was pleasantly surprised with the result. The angry bird flew down very close to Amber but it appears not to swoop and feeling very relieved she comes out of her test run relatively unscathed. But test two, fake eyes on the back of the head trick, didn't go so smoothly. 'See the eyes. It's quite a fierce magpie.' she said. 'From all reports it's not very nice so hopefully the eyes are going to work, I do have a helmet on so shouldn't hurt too much.' But she was so wrong! the magpie swooped and went on the attack, it hit her helmet causing Amber to start to panic. Test two : what Amber doesn't know is that this magpie will go straight for her, failing miserably . Got you! The magpie goes straight for Amber's helmet. Magpies are more aggressive and swoop people in breeding season between August and late October . Rider and walkers beware! : We are in the middle of magpie swooping season which lasts between August and late October as the bird get overprotective of their nests . Test one : It has worked. The magpie has stayed at a distance . The branches on the head trick has worked and kept the magpie at a safe distance . 'Ahhhhh, ahhhhhh, the eyes don't work, they eyes don't work,' she screamed. 'Ahhhh the eyes don't work. They don't work, they don't work. Get it off, get it off.' The attack lasted for more than thirty seconds and Amber was frantic. 'Is it gone, is it gone, it's not gone. Get it off, ahhhhhh, get mum, get mum, oh my god is it gone,' There was no doubt her magpie swooping theories had a clear result and her findings, one worked and one definitely did not work. The youtube clip also wrote, 'In case you missed Amber's results , The eyes don't work, the eyes don't work, the eyes don't work, the eyes don't work. Get mum, get mum, the eyes don't work'. Amber who claims she loves animals and always wanted to be a vet, documented the magpie theories for her breakfast show on Amber and Billo's Star FM weekdays program. A small percentage of magpies become highly aggressive during breeding season from late August to early October, and will swoop and sometimes attack passersby. Mostly male birds are generally known to attack pedestrians at around 50 m  from their nest, and cyclists at around 100 m. Attacks begin as the eggs hatch, increase in frequency and severity as the chicks grow, and tail off as the chicks leave the nest. Watch out : Magpies are on the lookout for vulnerable walkers and bike riders, with swooping season in full swing .","Two magpie swooping theories tested by Star FM's Amber Wheatland .

"Taxi apps such as Hailo and Uber are used to ‘e-hail’ a taxi every two seconds. And as these apps become smarter, experts predict they will sync with social networks and calendars to provide an even more efficient and tailored service to their passengers. TVs in the back of cabs could automatically change channel based on a user’s likes of dislikes, for example, or drivers could anticipate when and where a passenger will need a ride – even before the customer does. Scroll down for video . Taxi apps including San-Francisco based Hailo, Uber and Maaxi have created a culture of e-hailing and as these apps become smarter, they will sync with others to learn about passengers. For example, TV channels in the back of cars could broadcast favourite shows based on Facebook Likes, or could track a user’s schedule . The predictions were made in Hailo’s Future of Cities report, unveiled at an event in London alongside a range of new features. ‘In the next few years, the apps we use will begin to understand what we are doing and become more contextual,’ explained the report. ‘For Hailo, the app will know when you are leaving a client meeting and send a taxi to meet you.’ The report claims that the technology people carry with them is giving more control over what they do; allowing taxi apps to adapt the city to their needs, rather than the other way around . It was written by leading futurologists, Mark Brill and Ian Pearson. ‘Apps are already familiar, but the internet of things will integrate them, letting people interact with their surroundings much better,' said Mr Pearson. Earlier this week, designers at Washington-based iStrategyLabs unveiled their Dorothy prototype, that uses heel clicks to order a taxi. Dorothy is powered by the LightBlue Bean - an Arduino micro-controller inside a Ruby insert - and features an accelerometer, and a cell battery. The Ruby clips onto any shoe and connects wirelessly to the Dorothy app and a ‘trigger’ is activated using three clicks of the heel - and these triggers can be customised. The prototype version’s triggers include receiving a call, sending a template text to three friends or ordering an Uber taxi. When the onboard accelerometer detects clicks, it sends a signal to the connected phone via Bluetooth. He added that such apps may evolve to accommodate gestures such as snapping fingers, or using spoken commands to order taxis automatically. And as wearables increase in popularity, waving a hand to hail a cab will easily be detected by an electronic ring or wristband.

And, with a list of customer preferences sent during the booking procedure, drivers could advise passengers where to visit . Within the next five years, as self-driving technologies become more mainstream, the futurologists predict that many cars will converge with the high street. In addition to carrying passengers, self-driving cars, such as Google's prototype and Mercedes' Future Truck 2025, as well as traditional taxis, may also become delivery drivers. This means people could order a taxi to collect dry cleaning, for example, or deliver medicine using a single app. Uber announced earlier this week that it was partnering Vaccine Finder. The service delivers a registered nurse and a vaccine kit for up to 10 people, when ordered through the Uber app. Within five years, as self-driving technologies become more mainstream, futurologists predict many cars will converge with the high street.

The service is free, but is currently limited to Boston, New York and Washington between set times. It is part of the pilot launch of the UberHealth program. Uber has previously used this so-called, ‘on-demand model’ to deliver ice creams, and Valentine’s Day gifts. Mark Brill predicts that taxi apps and services will use such models to become more tailored to the passenger’s needs. ‘By combining big data with algorithms and statistical analysis, we can create a more intelligent service,' he wrote. ‘By mapping the movements of people from their mobile devices, it is possible to predict a need in advance of the event itself. ‘Imagine, in the future, your Hailo cab is on its way to you before you even know you need it.’ He continued that through the use of personal data, taxis will be able to deliver a unique service. This graphic reveals key figures in the first three years of Hailo. The app launched in two new UK cities, Liverpool and Leeds, this week, and is now available in Singapore. People hailing taxis on the street can now pay for them using their Hailo app - even if the cab isn't managed by Hailo . ‘As you step into the cab, [drivers] will have an idea of your likes, dislikes and interests.’ Taken from apps such as Facebook or Twitter. ‘The in-cab media will be showing you a relevant TV channel. Or maybe you want to work, in which case you’ll be offered a quiet, undisturbed journey? ‘Alternatively, perhaps you are planning to catch-up your favourite team’s game on TV when you get home? The driver will know you don’t want to hear the score.’ The experts also predict that owning a car will be a thing of the past as taxi apps expand to more regions and become alternatives to owning vehicles, especially in busy cities. Hailo launched in two new UK cities, Liverpool and Leeds, this week, and is now available in Singapore. People hailing taxis on the street can now pay for them using their Hailo app - even if the cab isn't managed by Hailo, too.

"Goal-line technology was put to use for the first time in the 2014 World Cup when France's Karim Benzema half-volleyed the ball at goal in their Group E opener against Honduras. The ball hit the post and trickled along the line, before goalkeeper Noel Valladares tried his best to stop it from going in. The Honduras shot-stopper, though, only fumbled it over as referee Sandro Ricci's watch confirmed the ball crossed the line - although replays looked inconclusive to the naked eye.

It works perfectly well, it's a goal, there's no confusion about it.' The highly-anticipated system, supplied by German company GoalControl, is flawless and, despite dubious replays, settled the debate in France's favour. It put the tie to bed, doubling France's advantage, and all but ensured 10-man Honduras' World Cup got off to a losing start. But for England fans, goal-line technology will always come four years too late to the tournament after Frank Lampard's infamous 'goal' that wasn't given against Germany in 2010. Honduras coach Luis Suarez had no complaints about the result, but admitted he was confused by the protocol which initially saw both a 'no goal' and a 'goal' verdict delivered by the GoalControl system following France's second. The first message related to Benzema's initial shot, while the second covered the Valladares fumble. ‘During the 90 minutes they played better than us. I have no excuses,’ Suarez said. ‘They were superior to us. It's hard to keep up with one less player. Being outnumbered, it is not easy. ‘On the second goal, the machine first said that there was no (goal), and after granted one.

"When Emily Scarratt lines up the kicks which may finally propel England to World Cup glory tomorrow, she will block out the noise and tension around her by imagining she is submerged in water – calm and quiet. Every goal-kicker has a tried and trusted routine to cope with the extreme individual pressure of their role. Jonny Wilkinson used to visualise the imaginary ‘Doris’ behind the posts and aim to knock a can of Coke out of her hand. Leigh Halfpenny pictures being far away from crowds and cameras; back at Gorseinon RFC, practising with his grandfather. Scarratt has her own formula to deal with the high-stakes duty she is performing for England at the women’s World Cup in Paris and it is serving the Lichfield centre well. Going swimmimgly: Emily Scarrett imagines she is submerged in water as she lines up her goal kicks . Best foot forward: Jonny Wilkinson kicks the winning drop goal to win the 2003 World Cup for England . Ahead of the final against Canada at a sold-out Stade Jean Bouin, the 24-year-old said: ‘We are playing in front of bigger crowds now which creates distractions so I try to block it all out. I think of it as being under water. I try to imagine that dull sound – almost silence – there is under water and that helps me focus. Then I take a big deep breath and just do what I always do when I kick a ball. It comes very instinctively now.’ That instinct has been honed over many years, since Scarratt – from Leicester – began playing rugby at the age of five. When she wasn’t at Welford Road supporting the Tigers, she was honing her skills with an unorthodox routine. ‘I grew up on a farm, so I used to practise kicking from my garden into a field,’ she said. ‘I only had two balls to practise with so I had to keep going backwards and forwards to retrieve them!’ Trounced: Emily Scarrett helped England beat Ireland 40-7 to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup . At a stretch: The England centre trains ahead of the World Cup final against Canada in Paris . Aside from this commitment to enhancing her shooting skills, which led to goal-kicking for an Under 18 team at the age of just 13, Scarratt would watch Geordan Murphy running amok for Leicester and yearn to emulate his attacking flair. Rugby was one of many sporting pursuits and she turned down a basketball scholarship in America at 16, after catching the eye on a tour there. That decision paid off. She made her England debut at 18 and reached a career target of 50 Test caps this year. Her supreme performance in the 40-7 semi-final win over Ireland drew widespread praise. Fourth time lucky? England want victory after losing the last three consecutive tournaments to New Zealand . With a half-century of Test appearances already, the next grand ambition is a collective one. England suffered an agonisingly narrow defeat in the home World Cup Final four years ago to finish as runners-up to New Zealand for the third consecutive tournament. Gary Street’s squad are hell-bent on making it fourth time lucky. ‘For some girls, this is their third opportunity, for a lot of us the second and for others the first, but we have all shared so many experiences and we can take that into the final,’ said Scarratt. ‘There is a real desire to perform well and if we do, the result will take care of itself.’ CLICK HERE to start picking your Fantasy Football team NOW!

"Lewis Hamilton is excited and encouraged by the news that Michael Schumacher is out of a coma after nearly six months. Schumacher, the seven-time Formula One world champion, suffered severe head injuries following a ski accident in the French resort of Meribel last December. Updates on his condition have been sparse, but Schumacher’s spokeswoman revealed on Monday that the German is now out of his medically-induced coma and has left Grenoble Hospital where he has been receiving treatment since the accident on December 29. Get well soon: Lewis Hamilton (R) is encouraged that Michael Schumacher has been taken out of a coma . Shock: Schumacher, pictured here in 2004, crashed while skiing on December 29 and was put into a coma . ‘It is amazing. Everywhere I go people ask about him. Whether it is the States, Canada – filling up a petrol station – people ask about him,’ said Hamilton. ‘I always keep him in my thoughts and prayers and it is a real positive to hear that there is some progress. ‘I have been trying to keep an ear out for what is going on and not really hearing of any improvements. ‘So to hear that he is really in that wake-up phase is just really encouraging and it is exciting, and the next step, and hopefully this is the first step on the ladder.’ Schumacher is now being treated at the University Hospital of the Canton of Vaud in Lausanne, Switzerland, 20 miles from home on the shore of Lake Geneva. ‘Michael has left the CHU Grenoble to continue his long phase of rehabilitation. He is not in a coma anymore,’ Schuamcher’s spokeswoman Sabine Kehm said on Monday. Road to recovery: F1 legend Michael Schumacher is no longer in a coma and has moved from his hospital . ‘His family would like to thank all his doctors, nurses and therapists in Grenoble as well as the first aiders at the place of the accident, who did an excellent job in those first months. ‘The family also wishes to thank all the people who have sent Michael all the many good wishes.

But in case you didn’t know, Ronaldo was named after US president Ronald Regan and his timed 'kick speed' is around 130 kilometres an hour, which is 31.1metres per second. That's more than four times that of Apollo 11 rocket's launching speed, which was the first rocket flight that landed man on the moon. So he really is Rocket Ronnie! Those coaches from the Premier League who are out in Brazil on scouting missions should get down to Curitiba for the clash between Iran and Nigeria. Iran have a 19-year-old wonderkid called Sardar Azmoun, who has been dubbed the 'Iranian Messi'. Currently with Rubin Kazan in Russia, he has already attracted the attention of Arsenal. Prospect: Iran's Sardar Azmoun (front row, second from right) has been described as the 'Iranian Lionel Messi' Iran boss Carlos Queiroz will be looking for a job at a Premier League or Championship club next season. Queiroz, who Sir Alex Ferguson rated as the best of his assistant managers at Manchester United, will leave after the finals because the Iran FA can no longer afford his £2million-a-year wages. Could Emmanuel Emenike become Nigeria’s Paolo Rossi? In 1982 Rossi returned to Italy after a long ban for an alleged betting scandal and became top scorer with six goals as he led the Azzurri to victory. Two years ago Emenike was in exile in the wake of match fixing allegations in Turkey, but back at Fernerbahce last season he hit 12 goals. Nigeria are unlikely to go all the way in Brazil but Emenike could be a Golden Boot dark horse, especially if he gets off to a flyer against Iran. Danger man: Nigeria's Emmanuel Emenike will be hoping to open his account against Iran . Daniel Sturridge indulged in his brand of funky dance celebration when he scored for England against Italy but if Ghana notch against the USA then the Liverpool striker’s moves will look rather stilted. Even during training sessions the Ghana players have been making a habit of collectively breaking out in traditional dance and song known as Azonto. Some even do backflips. Middlesbrough’s Albert Adomah said: 'If we score then everyone will break out into dance and song. It’s just spontaneous.' Forward planning: Ghana winger Albert Adomah says his side will sing and dance is they score against the USA . Today’s clash against Portugal is Germany’s 100th at a World Cup - the most appearances of any nation. They have reached the final on seven occasions, the same amount as five-time winners Brazil. Germany have won the trophy on three occasions. The Germany vs Portugal clash is so hard to call. But . given that Miroslav Klose is one short of Brazilian Ronaldo’s World Cup . record of 15 goals at finals, the 36-year-old German deserves a tickle . at 5-1 to be opening scorer. Cristiano Ronaldo is also 5-1. In some respects the 2-1 defeat to Italy has not affected England's perceived requirement to reach the knockout stage. Before England played Italy, the prevailing wisdom was that a solid opening draw against Andrea Pirlo and Co would leave Roy Hodgson’s men needing a point against Uruguay and a win against Costa Rica to make the last 16. Thanks to Costa Rica's shock 3-1 win over Uruguay, the form book suggests that England now need a draw against Uruguay and a win against Costa Rica to make the last 16. Of course Costa Rica are no pushovers as they have proved, but often unfancied teams that come out of the blocks flying eventually falter at the final hurdle of the group. And on the two occasions that England have lost their first games (in 1962 and 1986) they went on to reach the quarter-finals. Upset: England will probably need to beat Joel Campbell (left) and Costa Rica in their final group game after defeat to Italy in Manaus . World Cup memory . This tournament has perhaps the strongest collection of African nations at a World Cup finals. Pele once predicted an African team would win the World Cup at the turn of the 21st century. That breakthrough has yet to come and, despite their strength, Group G is tough group for Ghana to emerge from. But the fact they are considered a threat to Germany and Portugal emphasises how much African football has progressed since Zaire were the first black African nation to make a finals. Making history: Zaire, pictured here in action against Scotland during the 1974 World Cup, were the first African nation to compete at a finals . After losing 4-0 to Brazil and 2-0 Scotland they were trashed 9-0 by Yugoslavia. The Brazil game is best remembered for the mad moment when Zaire defender Mwepu Illunga rushed out from the wall and cleared a free-kick before Brazil had actually taken it. Combined with that defeat to Yugoslavia, who needed a big win to progress at the expense of Scotland, Zaire did no favours for the image of African football. But Cameroon, Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Ghana are all being taken very seriously this summer.","Real Madrid star Ronaldo and his Portugal team-mates will face Germany in their first World Cup game .

"Lewis Hamilton's maiden visit to the Red Bull Ring culminated with the Briton emerging top dog in practice on Friday. Situated in the Styrian mountains, the circuit - owned by billionaire energy drinks magnate Dietrich Mateschitz - is an old-school track complemented by modern-day facilities following a £60million revamp. The circuit itself, last used in F1 in 2003, has remained unaltered since that visit 11 years ago, much to the delight of the drivers. Leading the way: Lewis Hamilton ended the afternoon on top of the timesheets from Nico Rosberg . Top dog: The Briton was fastest at the Red Bull Ring as he bids to get his championship charge back on track . At just a fraction over two miles it is the third shortest circuit on the current calendar behind Monaco and Interlagos in Brazil, but provides the fastest lap. Coming into this weekend half the field had sampled the circuit via one form or another, be it in F1 many years ago, a junior formula or a track day. Hamilton, however, conceded a fortnight ago his knowledge of the circuit was such he did not even know the direction of turn one. But come the conclusion to the two 90-minute sessions it was the 29-year-old who led the way with a time of one minute 09.542secs, just 1.2secs slower than Michael Schumacher's race lap record set in 2003. Making his point: Rosberg is 22 points ahead of team-mate Hamilton in their battle for the championship . With the fastest of Pirelli's four compound tyres - the supersofts - strapped on to the Mercedes, Hamilton finished 0.377secs faster than team-mate Nico Rosberg as the duo resumed their battle for this season's Formula One world title. After retiring a fortnight ago in Canada, Hamilton is again in need of a run of victories to close the 22-point gap that has now opened up between himself and Rosberg, who has not been out of the top two all season after seven races. The pair were the only two drivers to dip under 70 seconds over the course of the undulating lap that incorporates just nine corners. As in the first practice session, when Rosberg edged Hamilton on the soft-compound rubber, Ferrari's Fernando Alonso was again third best but only just from Williams duo Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa. Off track: World champion Sebastian Vettel loses control of his RB10 at the final corner . Spinning around: But the German escaped the incident without any damage to his car . Reigning four-times champion Sebastian Vettel and team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, winner last time out in Canada to end Mercedes' dominant start to the campaign of six successive victories, were sixth and eighth quickest on the timesheet. In FP1, Vettel was fortunate to avoid a smash into a barrier on the opposite side of the pit wall. Coming out of the final corner, Vettel caught the grass and twice spun through 360 degrees, avoiding the barrier by inches, with his car remarkably ending up back on the circuit and pointing in the right direction. Vettel and Ricciardo sandwiched McLaren's Jenson Button, who finished 1.271secs down in a car boasting a number of upgrades this weekend, with his own team-mate in Kevin Magnussen ninth. Driving force: Formula One is back in Austria after an 11-year absence . Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne was again 10th, as in FP1, with Kimi Raikkonen seemingly struggling again in his Ferrari as the Finn was down in 11th, almost a second and a half back. Marussia's Max Chilton was in 18th, ahead of not only team-mate Jules Bianchi, but also the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, with the young Briton 2.687secs off the pace. Throughout session two in particular, virtually every driver ran wide at the turn eight right-hander, which is to result in a warning from race director Charlie Whiting. Given drivers could be penalised throughout the race for exceeding track limits, a timing screen message in FP2 confirmed Whiting is to ""inform the drivers of the future policy"" with regard to turn eight.","Mercedes led the way on Friday with Rosberg 0.377secs adrift of Hamilton .

"With their drastically different price points and clientele, Primark and Prada should be poles apart when it comes to looking after their customers. But it has been revealed that the two stores have one unexpected thing in common: their level of customer service. An independent guide to London shops has awarded both retailers a rating of just two out of five for their customer service. Not so posh: Luxury department store Prada, who show their collections on the world's most famous catwalks, have been rated the same at Primark for customer service . With the designer Bond Street store attracting the likes of Victoria Beckham and Gwyneth Paltrow, with an average handbag costing around £700, customers should expect an excellent level of service. But in fact, the research by fashion journalist Tracy Rose and her husband Russell for the third edition of their shopping guide, Fashion Fabulous London, reveals a surprisingly low score for the iconic Italian brand. Bargain basement: Primark, which copies Prada's designs and sells them for a fraction of the price, received the same rating as the designer store . The 100-year-old brand, . whose designs often inspire cheap product ranges by bargain retailers such as Primark, received a much worse customer service review . than it's cheaper counterpart. Tracy Rose, who visited the store, said: 'Once there, it seemed that the sales assistant had problems with person recognition, or maybe that she had come off a trance training course.' Famous fans: The likes of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Beyonce (both pictured attending Prada's costume gala) are huge fans of the 100-year-old brand . Writing about her visit to the 80,000 square foot Oxford Street Primark store, she commented that the service at the till was 'actually very friendly', which led to the service rating being doubled. The Roses carried out reviews of 200 different shops in the capital and decided that good service speaks for itself and therefore they judge it accordingly. Tracy Rose is a milliner and a fashion journalist on BBC, lTV, Channel 4 , Five, Sky News, GMTV, London Tonight and was a diarist for London Fashion Week. Her husband, Russell Rose, is co-editor of the Fashion Fabulous books and blog, London's top independent shopping guide.

"Justin Rose won’t get carried away watching England’s World Cup opener against Italy on Saturday after what happened to him four years ago. The Englishman, who is defending his US Open title this week, was leading the Travellers Championship on the PGA Tour by three shots when he tuned into England’s gut-wrenching 4-2 defeat to Germany. ‘It was a big game, an emotional football match and then I never really calmed down,' Rose recalled in his pre-tournament press conference at Pinehurst on Tuesday. Keeping concentration: Justin Rose insists he won't let England's World Cup campaign derail his US Open bid . ‘I think I watched it about 10 in the morning, we were playing at 2 o’clock in the afternoon and I ended up going out and losing the golf tournament.’ Rose has a tough task on his hands to defend the title he won at Merion 12 months ago, with former Ryder Cup captain Curtis Strange the last man to win back-to-back titles in 1988 and 1989. But there could also be a good omen in the fact that prior to Strange, the legendary Ben Hogan was the last man to do so in 1950 and 1951, with the first of those wins coming at Merion. 'I’ve allowed myself that thought for sure,' said Rose when asked about retaining the title. Prize guy: Rose will be hoping to retain his US Open trophy . 'Obviously that’s the plan this week. I felt like I had a good opportunity in 2012 at Olympic Club, too. I played really well there. I finished six shots back but as a player sometimes it’s a lot closer than that. 'I feel like the US Open test suits me. For me being defending champion, I don’t even like that word, defending, because it puts you already behind the eight ball. You don’t want to be out there being defensive at all. 'I’m just really excited about the opportunity this week presents. Obviously it is only one guy who has the opportunity to repeat, but I’m seeing that as a pressure-free situation. 'These tournaments are so hard to win, I’m just going to enjoy the challenge of trying to do that. 'I was the first English guy for 40-odd years (since Tony Jacklin in 1970) to win. That’s something sweet. But also it was my first major championship. That outweighed everything. Any time you win a major championship there’s probably history that’s made in some way or another. 'To win it again, the most important thing is my second major championship, but obviously to go back-to-back when it’s been a while since someone has been able to do that, that would just be the icing on the cake.' Upward curve: Rose has gone from strength to strength in recent years . Rose famously turned professional the day after finishing fourth as a 17-year-old amateur in the Open Championship in 1998, but missed his first 21 halfway cuts in succession. A first European Tour title arrived in 2002 and the 33-year-old has made steady progress ever since, culminating in his emotional victory on Father’s Day last year when he held off Phil Mickelson and Jason Day to win by two shots. 'The last few years of my career have been definitely on an upward trend and winning bigger and bigger tournaments, culminating in winning a major,' added Rose, who pointed to the heavens after holing out on the 72nd hole in memory of his late father Ken. Pressure free: Rose reckons he can enjoy his golf after getting the monkey off his back last year . 'I haven’t been one of the guys who have said ‘Well I’m going to win X amount of majors in my career’. So I really want to treat this major that I’ve won now as a gift and that gives me the ability to now sort of freewheel for the rest of my career, play free, play loose, just go after it. I’ve got really no pressure on me from that perspective any more. 'I think a lot of us put a lot of pressure on ourselves to get over the hump in a major championship. Just from an odds standpoint, they’re hard to win. 'So the fact I have won now, I think that really gives me the ability to have fun doing it again. Hopefully that will give me an advantage down the stretch on future occasions.'","Rose won't let Three Lions' World Cup bid derail his own goals .

"Click here for more from our brilliant Match Zone, including this map of Ivan Perisic scoring Croatia's second goal . A wild elbow from Alex Song on Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic ended Cameroon’s hopes of advancing from Group A in Manaus. The Barcelona midfielder was given a straight red card after losing his cool in the 40th minute, by which time Cameroon were already a goal behind. Cameroon’s night went from bad to worse following Song’s dismissal, as they conceded three times in the second half to quash any dreams they had of qualifying for the knockout stages. And to top things off, Tottenham defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto headbutted team-mate Benjamin Moukandjo in the closing stages. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Croatia fans celebrate their side's crushing victory . Drubbing: Ivan Perisic (second right) is mobbed after scoring Croatia's second goal of the night .

Subs Not Used: Zelenika, Vrsaljko, Vukojevic, Jelavic, Schildenfeld, Brozovic, Mocinic, Vida, Subasic. Booked: Eduardo. Goals: Olic 11, Perisic 48, Mandzukic 61, 73 . Attendance: 36,000 . Referee: Pedro Proenca (Portugal) Man of the Match: Ivan Perisic . Ivica Olic’s close-range finish gave Croatia the lead against the run of play in the 10th minute, after the Indomitable Lions had sparkled in the opening exchanges. A thunderous run and strike from Ivan Perisic doubled Croatia’s advantage shortly after the break, before Mandzukic marked his return from suspension with two goals in quick succession. There had been encouraging signs for Cameroon from kick-off, as they launched a series of attacks down the right. It took them 91 seconds to register a shot against Mexico in their 1-0 defeat in the opening game, but at the Amazonia Arena that statistic was put to bed. Less than 30 seconds had passed when Benjamin Moukandjo fashioned their first chance, firing into the side-netting from an acute angle. Volker Finke’s side continued to push and probe, with Vincent Aboubakar, starting in place of the injured Samuel Eto’o, causing particular havoc with his pace and trickery. Then, against the run of play, Croatia took the lead. A dangerous cross from Darijo Srna from the right fell straight to Perisic on the edge of the box and he dissected the Cameroon defence with a perfect pass to the back post, where Olic was on hand to thump home.

Packed to the rafters: Fans in Zagreb's main square celebrate cheer on Croatia . It was Olic’s second World Cup goal, more than a decade after his first, which came in a 2-1 victory over Italy in the 2002 group stages. Croatia’s opening goal against Brazil was created on the wing and it was out wide that Niko Kovac’s side looked to test Cameroon. Srna and Perisic continued to combine well down Croatia’s right, with Tottenham left-back Benoit Assou-Ekotto struggling to deal with the dual threat they posed. Eto’o could only gesture wildly from the bench as his team-mates lost their footing in the game as the half wore on – and their problems were compounded in the 40th minute when Song was dismissed. Referee Pedro Proenca reached straight for red after Song wildly lashed out at Mandzukic with his arm as Croatia tried to counter down the left-hand side. Song bowed his head as he trudged from the pitch in Manaus, four years after his spat with Eto’o had split the Cameroon camp. Cameroon lost all three of their games at that tournament, and look to be heading for a similar conclusion in Brazil.

Before his moment of madness the former Arsenal man and Joel Matip had been doing a fine job of keeping Croatia’s central midfield pairing of Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic quiet. How that would change with Cameroon down to 10 men. Even in the final minutes of the first half, the space Song’s absence afforded them was noticeable. Finke introduced defender Dany Nounkeo for the second half to try to shore up Cameroon’s defence. Super Mario: Bayern Munich striker Mandzukic celebrates his first goal . Tap-in: Mandzukic was left with the simplest of finishes to make it 4-0 to Croatia . Game over: Stars of the show Perisic and Mandzukic go wild again as Cameroon are put to the sword . His first involvement was to trail in Perisic’s wake as the Wolfsburg forward hared down the left, cut into the penalty area, and then curled a shot into the far corner with Charles Itanjde pulled out of position. Mandzukic needed two chances to make it 3-0. First he shot wide after being put clean through by the Brazil-born Sammir, before rising highest to head an outswinging Pranjic corner past the despairing dive of Itanjde. Croatia freshened things up with 20 minutes left, introducing Inter Milan starlet Mateo Kovacic and former Arsenal forward Eduardo. Scrap: Assou-Ekotto and Moukandjo come to blows as Croatia are gifted another chance late on . Peacemaker: Unused substitute Samuel Eto'o steps in calm things down . And it was the two substitutes that combined for Croatia’s fourth and final goal. Kovacic cut the ball back to Eduardo, the Shakhtar striker forced Itanjde into a smart low stop, but there was Mandzukic on hand to pass the rebound into an empty net. Then came the unsavoury clash between Assou-Ekotto and Moukandjo, which rather summed up Cameroon's night.

"A gang of teenage girls terrorised young women in Manchester's 'studentland' in a string of violent robberies. Female revellers and university students were targeted in night-time street attacks on Wilmslow Road and its outskirts during the gang's seven-month crime spree, a Manchester Crown Court sentencing hearing was told. In one incident, five female revellers in Fallowfield were grabbed by their hair and dragged to the ground before being repeatedly punched and kicked by Margaret Grey and Zara Hussain, who binged on vodka before looking for victims. Daniella Hodge, pictured of Openshaw, Manchester was given a two-year community order after admitting charges of robbery and attempted robbery at Manchester Crown Court following the violent incidents . The gang targeted their victims in the Fallowfield area of Manchester which was popular with students . Three hours later, in the same area, another young woman had her earring ripped out and was left covered with blood after the pair pounced on her and stole her phone. Then two-and-a-half months later, while on bail, Grey teamed up with Daniella Hodge and Chloe Minchion to rob female Manchester University students on their way home in Victoria Park. The victims were chased down and beaten up before the trio escaped with one of their bags. Four months after that, again while on bail, Grey and Hussain attacked a shopkeeper who challenged them for touching goods he was moving in Longsight. Punched 10 times in the face by Grey, he told police he was 'terrified' of the pair, who subjected him to vile racial slurs. Grey, 18, of Longsight, Manchester, has been jailed up for 32 months and banned from seeing the other girls by an Asbo after admitting two robberies, two attempted robberies and racially aggravated assault, - offences spanning between last September and April this year. Margaret Grey teamed up with Daniella Hodge and Chloe Minchion to rob female Manchester University students on their way home in Victoria Park (pictured) One of the gang, Chloe Minchion, is wanted by police after failing to turn up to court for her sentencing . Hussain, 20, of Burnage, Manchester, was jailed for 20 months after admitting robbery and attempted robbery. Hodge, 18, of  Openshaw, Manchester, was given a two-year community order with supervision and a requirement to attend a probation service programme for robbery and attempted robbery. Minchion, who recently gave birth to a child, is wanted by police after failing to show up for sentence on the same charges. Judge Robert Atherton poured scorn on their claims of remorse, saying: 'The victims of all those robberies were young women going about enjoying themselves and minding their own business. 'You fall into that group of people who go out, get drunk, misbehave, and say 'I'm terribly sorry, I was drunk, I've had a bad upbringing, I didn't mean it.'","The teenage girls targeted students at Manchester University late at night .

"West Ham are chasing Manchester City defender Micah Richards, who is set to leave the Barclays Premier League champions this summer. Hammers boss Sam Allardyce is in the market for a new right-back and has identified the versatile defender as a potential summer signing. Richards looks likely to leave the Etihad Stadium this summer following a frustrating season under Manuel Pellegrini. Moving on: Micah Richards (centre) is set to quit City after growing tired of not playing regularly . The 25-year-old is at a crossroads in his career given he has just 12 months left on his current deal. City have offered Richards a contract extension, but the full-back has shown a reluctance to sign the deal given his lack of action under Pellegrini. The champions are desperate to keep their British stars at the club, Richards being one, as they struggle to fulfill homegrown quota regulations and have not given up hope of persuading the defender to stay. But City know Richards can leave the club . on a free transfer next season when his contract expires, a scenario . they want to avoid. Heading north: Bacary Sagna is currently with France at the World Cup but is expected to join City soon . Richards' chances under Pellegrini will be even more limited next term due to the pending arrival of Bacary Sagna. West Ham's interest, which is at an early stage, will be dependent on the cost of the deal. Despite having only 12 months left City could demand upwards of £5million for the defender, while his current £70,000-per-week wages could also prove a stumbling block.","Richards' contract expires in 12 months and he is reluctant to sign new deal .

"Grieving friends and family have taken to social media to pay tribute to a the 'beautiful, precious and courageous' woman who passed away last week after losing her battle with a life-long illness. Kari-Lee Birrell, 25, from the Sunshine Coast, spent the last two months of her life in hospital after complications from a double lung transplant resulted in a bacterial infection that would eventually claim her life. More than 1000 friends and family attended the funeral service for the former Suncoast Christian College student, whose turquoise coffin was driven to the Woombye church in a combi van. Kari-Lee Birrell, 25, from the Sunshine Coast, spent the last two months of her life in hospital after complications from a double lung transplant resulted in a bacterial infection that would eventually claim her life . 'You looked so beautiful and as I wiped away my own few tears, I knew it was right,' Mr Birrell said in his tribute . Ms Birrell had married her husband Tom in a surprise ceremony at their engagement party in December last year, reflecting the adventurous and passionate that her illness could never take from her. Mr Birrell said in his tribute to his beloved wife, who he met at his parents cafe, that their wedding was 'perfect' and that Ms Birrell was 'so beautiful'. 'When you were walking across from the house, I was thinking to myself ""Could this get any better?"" Yes. and it did,’'he said. 'You looked so beautiful and as I wiped away my own few tears, I knew it was right.' 'It couldn’t have been more perfect. It was the best day of my life.' Diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder affecting the lungs and digestive system, at just six weeks old, Ms Birrell knew what is was like to fight for the life she loved. Before her health deteriorated rapidly two years ago, she was studying to become a paramedic, and had work hard towards becoming a talented dancer, fulfilling a dream to dance in the Rio Carnival, reported the Sunshine Coast Daily. Ms Birrell's mother-in-law took to social media to express her grief at the loss of her son's wife, describing her as a fighter and praising her for her strength and courage. Michelle Birrell wrote, 'She has fought valiantly for the last 25 years against Cystic Fibrosis, determining in her heart that it would never define her life,' the Sunshine Coast Daily reported. Diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder affecting the lungs and digestive system, at just six weeks old, Ms Birrell knew what is was like to fight for the life she loved . 'She has travelled the world, she loved to dance and she lived life with passion.' Mrs Birrell said that her son and daughter-in-law never lost hope and clung to their strong Christian beliefs throughout their ordeal. Friends posted tributes on her Facebook page attesting to her love for life and her unquenchable curiosity about the world around her. In the past few years Ms Birrell had traveled to 44 countries, chasing her dreams and making the most of every opportunity presented to her.

"Armed forces veterans are to receive extra help to get jobs and transition into civilian life under a set of special measures announced by the Government. The Prime Minister will launch the biggest overhaul of services for troops leaving the Forces with more than 60 changes being made. The recommendations span every aspect of daily life - from education and training, to employment, housing, health, welfare and financial support. The Prime Minister (pictured meeting RAF troops in Camp Bastion earlier this month) will launch the biggest overhaul of services for troops leaving the Forces with more than 60 changes being made . It is aimed to support wounded soldiers and those at risk of turning to crime or suffering mental illness. Ministers are keen to cut the number of veterans who end up in jail after returning from the front line. About one in 30 prisoners have been in the Armed Forces. Lord Ashcroft was commissioned by David Cameron to draw up the recommendations . Lord Ashcroft was commissioned by David Cameron to draw up the recommendations. The Tory peer said more should be done to emphasise that former service personnel have a ‘great deal to offer’. He said: ‘I am pleased to see that the Government has accepted the great majority of the proposals, and that work is already underway on many of them.’ Prime Minister David Cameron said on Saturday: ‘Our brave servicemen and women make huge sacrifices to keep this country safe. Whatever the reasons behind their decision to leave our armed services, we must absolutely do all we can to smooth the move into civilian life. ‘That is why Lord Ashcroft’s review is so important, because it pinpoints the areas where we need to do more. 'I’m pleased that much of that work is now under way and I am determined to ensure that we deliver on the rest to ensure that our Armed Forces have the support they need to build a secure and better future.’ Whitehall officials say work is already under way to establish a single 24-hour contact centre number for veterans in urgent need of advice, supported by Combat Stress and the Samaritans. Other measures being rolled out also include resettlement advice for all those who leave the Services and education schemes to help Services personnel manage their finances better. The Government is also looking to introduce a longterm development and career support system and provide online courses.","Aimed at preventing veterans turning to crime or suffering mental illness .

"Would you go to a concert where you watch a video of a popstar that doesn't really exist? It might sound bizarre, but it’s the latest craze currently taking Japan by storm - and the star herself has now made her way to the US. Named Hatsune Miku, the computer generated character sings songs created by her fans using voice software and then performs for wild crowds on a screen at the front of an arena. Scroll down for video . A virtual popstar called Hatsune Miku (shown) has made her way to the US. The character was designed as a mascot for software called Vocaloid 2. Now fans have created songs for her and regularly watch her in concert. She has a huge following in Japan and recently performed in New York . Hatsune Miku was created by Japanese music technology company Crypton Future Media. She was originally intended as just a mascot for voice software called Vocaloid 2, made by Yamaha. But when users of the software were given the ability to make her sing songs they had written, it quickly became apparent she had the makings of a worldwide superstar. She has proved to be a smash hit in Japan, and last week performed in New York for the first time, at the Hammerstein Ballroom in the Manhattan Center Studios. The character appears as a 16-year-old girl that has her hair in pig tails and her name translates as the ‘first sound of the future’ - perhaps heralding a belief she will lead to a revolution in the music industry. Miku is a digital avatar created by Japanese technology firm Crypton Future Media that customers can purchase and then program to perform any song on their computer. She is supposed to be 16 years old and five foot two inches tall but her makers have given little away about her personality. Crypton uses voices recorded by actors and then puts them through Yamaha’s Vocaloid software to create its characters. Miku’s voice was created by taking vocal samples from the voice actress Saki Fujita. All of the samples contained a single Japanese sound which when strung together would create full words and phrases. Her music and image have proved so popular that she has now gone on a sell-out tour where thousands of fans wave light sticks and scream as if she is a real-life pop star. While her voice is synthesised, its origins come from Japanese voice actress Saki Fujita. And perhaps one of her most interesting aspects is that all the songs she performs ‘live’ are created by her own users, in a sense being crowdsourced. ‘It's not just celebrating the idol; the fans are celebrating themselves,' said Cosima Oka-Doerge, the global marketing manager at Crypton, according to Fast Company. Crypton says more than 100,000 songs have been made by fans, in addition to more than 170,000 YouTube videos and more than a million works of fan art since she was 'born' on 31 August 2007. When Hatsune Miku performs, fans wave glow sticks wildly and sing along to her songs. She sings her most popular songs on stage, initiates 'call and response' routines with the crowd and dances around as well - just like a real popstar. Being a virtual star, though, she can also do things that her real counterparts cannot - such as exploding in a shower of light. Hatsune Miku has even toured with Lady Gaga, appearing ‘on stage’ during her Artpop Ball concert in Atlanta in May this year. It remains to be seen quite how big an impact she'll have in the West, though. Earlier this year a hologram of the late Michael Jackson was projected at the Billboard Awards in Las Vegas. The eerily realistic projection 'sang' and 'danced' to Slave To The Rhythm and even moonwalked across the stage. Mesmerising: A hologram of Michael Jackson performed at the Billboard Music Awards in May this year . The onstage resurrection garnered a standing ovation by the audience, who were clearly moved by the performance nearly five years after the legendary performer's death - but it almost didn't happen at all. Only several days before the awards ceremony did a federal judge rule that the Billboard Music Awards could use the hologram, rejecting efforts from tech companies seeking to block the digital performance. The songs Hatsune Miku performs are made by her fans using software called Vocaloid 2 (shown). Her fans wave glowsticks and scream and shout when she performs - just like a real popstar.

"A total of nine women - including a popular Canadian television actress - have now come forward to claim CBC radio host Jian Ghomeshi slapped, choked and verbally assaulted them on dates and at work in the past 12 years. The founder of radio show Q was fired from the program on Sunday, amid accusations of sexual assault, which he claimed were started by a jilted ex-girlfriend looking for revenge. The 47-year-old's lawyers have allegedly moved to sue the public-funded broadcasting company for $55million dollars, claiming he was fired over a 'moral judgement' of his BDSM lifestyle. But according to the eight women who have come forward to the Toronto Star, and one to a CBC radio show, his actions in the bedroom were anything but consensual. Two of the women have also made the bizarre allegation that Ghomeshi would turn his stuffed animal 'Big Ears Teddy' away from the bed when he allegedly forced violent sex. Actress Lucy DeCoutere, who stars on the television show Trailer Park Boys, is the only one of the nine victims to identify herself. The others decided to remain anonymous, fearing retribution from Ghomeshi and online bullying. Actress Lucy DeCoutere (left), who appears on television show Trailer Park Boys, is one of nine women who have come forward to detail violent sexual attacks by fired-CBC radio host Jian Ghomeshi (right) DeCoutere says she first met Ghomeshi at a barbecue in Banff in 2003, and that they later met up in Toronto to have dinner. She says throughout the meal, Ghomeshi went on about how famous he was and 'how lucky you are to be with me'. After dinner, they went back to Ghomeshi's house where they began making out. But things soon turned violent when Ghomeshi pushed DeCoutere against a wall, choked her and slapped her three times. 'He did not ask if I was into it. It was never a question. It was shocking to me. The men I have spent time with are loving people,' said DeCoutere, who also works as a captain in the Royal Canadian Air Force when she is not acting. DeCoutere promptly left in a taxi. The Star goes on to detail each account from the other seven victims, which occurred as early as 2002 and as recently as 2013. Three of the women met Ghomeshi in 2012, when he was touring the country to support his autobiography, and two of the women are co-workers. One of the women says she was in a work meeting with Ghomeshi when they were left alone in a room and he leaned over to say: 'I want to hate f*** you'. While the woman claims to have reported Ghomeshi's inappropriate behavior, including a time when he grabbed her buttocks, to her union supervisor, she doesn't believe the host was ever punished. The CBC says it is now investigating the incident. Fired: Ghomeshi was fired from his radio show Q on Sunday amid allegations of sexual assault. He says he was wrongly terminated after executives found out about his BDSM lifestyle. However, nine women are saying their sexual encounters with Ghomeshi were NOT consensual . Another CBC producer says she met Ghomeshi during his book tour and that she was attacked by him in a hotel room. She didn't report the incident because she 'felt like Jian was a CBC god'. Two of the women also told the story of Big Ears Teddy, a stuffed animal that played a role in their sexual encounters with Ghomeshi. One woman who was invited over to Ghomeshi's house says he turned the teddy bear to face away from the bed saying: 'Big Ears Teddy shouldn't see this'. On Sunday, the CBC announced that Ghomeshi would no longer be working for the network in a vague statement saying recently-revealed information 'precludes us from continuing our relationship'. Following that announcement, the Toronto Star published their first article with four accounts from alleged victims. The ninth anonymous woman met him at a Christmas media party more than a decade ago. She described the radio show host and musician as 'smitten' with her and she in turn said she was charmed by his charismatic personality. Their first date was to watch him tape his own show and they socialized with his colleagues and then went to a bar afterwards to talk. She said he was only charming and gave her no reason at all to worry. He drove her home and while in the car on the way to hers he came on to her and asked her if she would undo her blouse buttons. She said 'no' at which point, the woman alleges, Ghomeshi reached over and grabbed her hair and pulled her head back. He then allegedly said something like 'how do you like that?' The woman then said she asked him to stop and she got out of the car. The woman though, told CBC that she agreed to see him again, because she thought he 'might just have been too rough' - but nothing that couldn't be ironed out. Two of the women also told the story of Big Ears Teddy, a stuffed animal that played a role in their sexual encounters with Ghomeshi . On the second date, she brought a friend along but then at the end of the evening went back to his house. The two got friendly back at his and during a clinch she alleges that he pulled her hair again, this time only harder and then began to punch her on the ears till she cried. The anonymous woman then fled his home and went to a friends house and cried throughout the night. When asked why she didn't press charges or call the police, the woman said she only wanted to curl up in a corner. She said she was so shocked by the seemingly charming man's violence that it left her feeling only shock - but now she wishes she had gone to the police. Ghomeshi responded to his dismissal by writing a Facebook post claiming a spurned ex-girlfriend started spreading sexual assault rumors. In the post, Ghomeshi speaks about his sexual preferences saying: 'I have always been interested in a variety of activities in the bedroom but I only participate in sexual practices that are mutually agreed upon, consensual, and exciting for both partners.' A dark Twitter account sprung up earlier this year which posted messages to Ghomeshi. The Twitter account has the handle, 'BigEarsTeddy' and appears to make allegations of abuse against the CBC host . Ghomeshi goes on to say that he revealed all of this to his employers in an attempt to be transparent about the allegations, in case the story was ever published. He says last week he gave the network 'proof' that the sexual relationship was consensual, and that while his employers believed him they decided to terminate his contract, afraid that if his sexual life became public, it would cause a scandal. 'CBC execs confirmed that the information provided showed that there was consent. In fact, they later said to me and my team that there is no question in their minds that there has always been consent. They said they’re not concerned about the legal side. 'But then they said that this type of sexual behavior was unbecoming of a prominent host on the CBC. They said that I was being dismissed for ""the risk of the perception that may come from a story that could come out."" To recap, I am being fired in my prime from the show I love and built and threw myself into for years because of what I do in my private life.' Ghomeshi has been at the CBC for 14 years, and has been the host of the popular radio show Q, which he founded, since 2007. Recent interviews include Lena Dunham, Jamie Oliver and Ethan Hawke.","Jian Ghomeshi was fired from his CBC radio show Q on Sunday amid sexual assault allegations .

"Gunners need a second goalkeeper after Lukasz Fabianki's move to Swansea . Reina, 31, spent last season on loan at Napoli . Reina could dislodge Iker Casillas as No 1 in Spain team . Arsenal are considering a £5million move for Liverpool’s Pepe Reina — the Spain goalkeeper Arsene Wenger tried to sign for £20m four years ago. Wenger needs a second goalkeeper after Lukasz Fabianski moved to Swansea but Reina’s arrival would put current keeper Wojciech Szczesny under huge pressure. Reina would expect to oust him and play in the first team if he were to make the move. Currently behind Iker Casillas in the Spanish pecking order, Reina could find himself promoted after the 5-1 horror show against Holland in Brazil on Friday night. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pepe Reina in action against Cazorla and Torres during Spain training . Up for grabs: Arsenal are keen to swoop for Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina this summer . The Liverpool keeper spent all last year on loan at Napoli and though Rafa Benitez would be keen to have him back in Serie A next season, Liverpool would prefer him to have a permanent move so they do not have to keep subsidising his wages. Napoli also have Brazilian keeper Rafael developing well and are keen to spend their budget in other areas. Wenger tried to sign Reina in 2010 when Arsenal bid £20m but Liverpool refused to sell him at the time. Replacement: Arsene Wenger is to bring in a second goalkeeper after losing Lukasz Fabianski to Swansea earlier this summer . Reina was a popular figure on Merseyside before he was sent out on loan to Serie A side Napoli . The Spain No 2, who is now 31, would be available for much less than that now, with just two years left on his contract and with Simon Mignolet having established himself as the new No 1 at Liverpool. Arsenal would expect to pay about £5m. Arsenal also need to sign a new striker and have been quoted £32m to sign Real Madrid’s Alvaro Morata — even though the player only has one more year on his contract. That price tag means Arsenal’s interest has cooled considerably. Bayern Munich’s Mario Mandzukic is an alternative while Wenger is also looking to sign another midfielder. Borussia Dortmund’s Sven Bender is under consideration. On the radar: Arsenal are also keeping tabs on Real's Alvaro Morata (L) and Bayern striker Mario Mandzukic .","Gunners need a second goalkeeper after Lukasz Fabianki's move to Swansea .

"Australian military forces have completed their first armed combat mission in northern Iraq overnight, the Chief of Defence has confirmed via Twitter. No bombs were dropped in the first mission which saw two F/A-18F Super Hornets leave a military base in Dubai to take out Islamic State targets. The jets flew around northern Iraq for seven hours but it's believed they did not locate the targets and no munitions were used. The jets then returned safely to Dubai, Chief of Defence Mark Binskin confirmed on Monday morning. 'On this occasion the aircraft did not use their munitions and have returned to base to disarm and prepare for future sorties,' a Department of Defence statement said.

But he added: 'We must say months and more because we want to under-promise and over-deliver here. 'I'm quietly confident... but the fact is, we haven't even begun to deal with the threat to the civilian population in Iraq.' Mr Johnston also said there was a chance Australian troops could be the focus of insider attack, which were seen during the Afghanistan War.

"Great-grandmother Jennie Bryant (pictured) died on July 5 following an alleged assault by another patient at Brockwell Court nursing home . An 89 year-old woman died as a result of a blow to the head following an alleged attack by a fellow nursing home resident, an inquest heard. Jennie Bryant, who suffers with dementia, was believed to have suffered the injury during an argument with another elderly patient at Brockwell Court nursing home on June 28. The great-grandmother was taken to University Hospital North Durham for treatment but died a week later on July 5, Crook Coroners Court heard. A 71 year-old male resident of the care home has been subsequently detained under the Mental Health Act. Dr Leslie Hamilton, assistant coroner for Durham and Darlington, was told the woman's death was a result of blunt trauma to the head following the alleged assault. Dr Hamilton: 'She died due to an assault at the nursing home possibly from another resident. 'Investigations are being under taken by the police. 'A post-mortem was carried out by Dr Jenny Bolton on July 6 and at the request of the police a second post-mortem was carried out.' Durham Constabulary and the Care Quality Commission opened an investigation into what happened and police arrested a 71 year-old male resident on suspicion of assault at the time of the incident.

"These revealing pictures illustrate America's prison system at breaking point - with overcrowding in the nation's jails at its highest for eight years. Correctional institutions across the U.S are bursting at the seams with more than two million Americans behind bars. The worst hit state, California, houses 140,000 inmates when its 33 adult prisons are only designed to hold a maximum of 80,000. Overall, the Bureau of Prisons Network is around 39 per cent over 'rated capacity' - their highest level since 2004 - with that figure expected to soar to 45 per cent above its limit by 2018.

The Supreme Court has ordered California to release more than 30,000 inmates over the next two years . An inmate stands in his overcrowded cell at the Orange County jail in Santa Ana, California. The state's prisons are so overcrowded that they are said to provide inadequate mental and health care . Hundreds of prisoners at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego, California are also housed in makeshift living quarters in the prison's gymnasium . One inmate is forced to sleep next to phones where fellow prisoners make phone calls home at the Orange County jail . The Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego, pictured, is another of those drastically overstretched by increased prisoner numbers . So bad is the situation in California that the Supreme Court has slapped an order on the state ruling that 30,000 prisoners must be released by the middle of next year, labelling overcrowded conditions in its jails as 'unconstitutional'. The prison system has seen a stream of new offenders in the past five years and is still massively overstretched despite extra space being added. Wardens and experts now fear that increased overcrowding and an increasing lack of privacy for inmates will see them more prone to lashing out and causing trouble. Many prisons have had to create makeshift living quarters for detainees in public spaces such as gymnasiums, with some inmates having to sleep in bunks of three, while some cells which are only designed to house one person are home to up to three. Inmates are being allowed less time in communal areas such as the cafeteria, TV rooms and recreation yards. The country is streets ahead of the rest of the world in terms of the number of prisoners per 100,000 population, with Russia the second highest and South Africa in third. The European average took fourth place. Prisons have had to reduce the amount of time that inmates are spending in public spaces such as the cafeteria or the exercise yard, pictured . A makeshift living space for prisoners doubles up as a recreation area at this prison in Chino, California, with a group of inmates using the bed as a poker table . Prisoners at the Mule Creek State Prison in Ione, seem unfazed despite having to bunk in threes, but the Supreme Court disagrees ruling that such overcrowding is 'unconstitutional' It is feared that prisoners living in such proximity as those pictured could lead to clashes and violence between inmates behind bars . This prison, the Mule Creek State Prison in Ione, which houses murderers, child molesters, thieves and other criminals, is one of the most overcrowded in California. Some inmates have to share triple bunk beds in large public areas (pictured) A rare moment of solitude for this inmate at the overcrowded Orange County jail in Santa Ana, California. Prisons in the US are their most stretched in terms of capacity since 2004 . With the American prison system bursting at the seams, these inmates have their work cut trying to sort the ever growing piles of laundry caused by increasing inmate numbers . This inmate talks on the phone to a loved one in a crowded gymnasium area at a California prison, but he could soon be back at home with his family with shortened sentences one possible way to cope with unprecedented release numbers . Wardens warn that less time in recreational areas such as this yard at a California jail coupled with an increased lack of privacy for prisoners could lead more inmates to lash out . This prisoner in Chino tries to make the most of the relative open space of the exercise yard, but is still surrounded by fellow convicts . This tattooed prisoner at the California Institution for Men state prison in Chino makes the most of stretching out, but the picture shows how close together the beds are .

"Australia are the ‘dirtiest’ nation in World Cup history when measured by the number of red cards at finals compared to the number of games played. Taking into account only those countries who have played in at least three finals, the Aussies come out on top having received four reds in 10 matches — a ‘red rate’ of 40 per cent. Next in the bad boys’ list are Cameroon, with seven reds in 20 matches, at a rate of 35 per cent, followed by Croatia (three in 13, 23 per cent) Algeria and South Africa (two in nine, 22 per cent) and Portugal (five in 23, 22 per cent).

The history of red cards at past World Cups suggests England might be happy to land Mexican official Marco Rodriguez as the man in the middle for their game with Uruguay. History shows that Mexican refs have dished out more red cards — 22 from a total of 159 — than officials from any other nation. And half of those have been shown to South American teams. That statistic suggests Mexican officials single out teams from the same continent. Rodriguez has given four reds in the last two World Cups — to Paraquay, Serbia, Australia and Chile.","The countries with the most red cards at World Cup finals are Brazil (11), Argentina (10) and Uruguay (9)

"An American man has joined pro-Russian fighters in Ukraine. Masked by a camouflage balaclava with a rifle over his shoulder, the man appeared in a YouTube video calling on US citizens to join him. Referring to himself simply as Hunter, he says he left his hometown in Illinois for Yasynuvata, north of Donetsk, a month ago 'to help Novorossiya become an independent state'. Revealed: This is the American man self-defined as Hunter who claims to be fighting with pro-Russian rebels . Conflict: Here he is pictured emerging from a trench near Yasynuvata, north of separatist stronghold Donetsk . He admits his knowledge of the situation is 'limited' and he doesn't speak a word of Russian as he flashes his passport saying: 'I'm an American. I joined an independence movement.' Defending his move, he says: 'It seems the Kiev junta wants to maintain control over this area, Donbass, and the people of Donbass want to be independent of the Kiev junta. 'It seems to be a very simple, straightforward situation. 'And the Kiev junta does not necessarily, I believe, reflect... they don't consider the popular opinion of the people of Donbass. So that's why this issue is happening.' He then urges American soldiers to join the fight: 'If people want to come here, particularly from the West, the Western world, it'd be good to come here. 'Especially if they have military experience... U.S. military experience would be very valuable here too.' 'Limited understanding': He told the YouTube video he doesn't speak Russian and knows little of the conflict . Call to arms: He urged Americans, particularly those with military experience, to come to help the rebels . Hunter tells the camera he has become disillusioned with both the Democrats and the Republicans, but most recently identified as a Republican voter. The only thing he misses so far are burgers, he said. The three-minute video was posted on YouTube on Sunday by the pro-Russian separatist group Patriot Forces of Donbass as Ukraine was hit by its worst violence in a week. Fighting between pro-Russian rebels and government troops in the east of the country killed at least 12 people and wounded 32. Colonel Andriy Lysenko told journalists in a briefing in Kiev yesterday that at least nine troops were killed and 27 had been wounded during clashes in Donetsk, Kharkiv, and Luhansk on Saturday. Raging on: More than 3,500 lives have been claimed by the conflict since April, figures have shown . Meanwhile, the city council of Donetsk said in a statement published online that at least three civilians were killed and five wounded in overnight shelling of a residential area in the northern part of the city, where fighting has centered on the government-held airport. Violence has continued despite a cease-fire declared on September 5. Since fighting began in April, the conflict has claimed at least 3,500 lives. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has been at pains to insist to a skeptical audience at home that his peace plan is working. Hunter spoke beside rebel trenches in Yasynuvata, a town north of the separatist stronghold of Donetsk and less than a mile from Ukrainian forces. He told Reuters he joined the efforts in mid-August but was initially detained and interrogated on suspicion of being a spy because the rebels see the United States as a geopolitical rival for Russia and their own enemy in a Cold War-style standoff over Ukraine.","Man appeared in 3-minute YouTube video, said he is from Illinois .

"Will Lionel Messi win the World Cup Golden Boot? The Beautiful Game moved into the scenic splendour of Rio de Janeiro, the path to its spiritual home at the  great Maracana paved with the irony of an invasion force of some 25,000 Argentinians marching there via the swirling pavements of the Copacabana. This World Cup is now the party nobody wants to miss. From the dark forebodings of socio-political strife a football phoenix has arisen, in all its multi-coloured plumage. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Argentina fans celebrate Messi-inspired victory against Bosnia . Perfect 10: Lionel Messi stands and celebrates his goal in Argentina's win over Bosnia and Herzegovina . Lighting up the world: Messi celebrates his goal . Goals . galore. Upsets  of wonderment. The most opening matches without any kind . of  draw  – let alone a bore – since before the war. Even the first . high-technology goal award. Thus the challenge of keeping the Brazilian faith fell to this country’s most envious of sporting neighbours. To . break the spell would be criminal. For Argentina to do so in this part . of the world where the game is a religion would be sacrilege. Those . hybrids of Bosnia-Herzegovina were also asked to play their part – and . did so to increasingly heightened Argentine tension -  but the weight of . expectation was on all the blue-and-white striped shoulders, not only . those hunched in the household name of Lionel Messi. Welcome to the party: Lionel Messi announces himself on the World Cup stage with his goal . Master at work: Messi watches his shot hit the post and go into the goal . Argentina, two-time winners, are a World Cup power with a coven of stars and that stature brings with it responsibilities. Brazil, . Holland, Italy, England even in defeat, France in the teeth of cynical . intimidation from Honduras, had already met that standard. They had . started football back down the road to what it always should be – the . opiate of the masses no matter how down-trodden they may be. Here, if only for a few short weeks, is escapism from the poverty and inequality of the favelas.Never mind the quantifying of the cost, feed on the spectacle. The . first game here came as an important staging post in this project. This, 28 days later, is  where it will all come to a climax. Hopefully . glorious. Belief: There were 25,000 Argentina fans in the Maracana to watch their side win . Party trick: Argentina's Marcos Rojo shows off his skills in the game . Argentina . are among those with the most serious aspirations of making that return . date. Part of that desire is rooted in the rivalry with Brazil which is . among the most passionate in the football world. Nothing could be sweeter for Messi and his men to meet and beat the host nation in that final. But . first they had to deal with these  eight-syllable Europeans and . although  they had so many of their countrymen here encouraging them . that proved challenging in the extreme. A . mixture of Bosnia-Herzegovina’s readiness to take the fight to them and . tell-tale signs of that familiar Argentine arrogance answered the call . to provide more thrills and spills – but did nothing to suggest that we . were in the presence of potential world champions. Making their mark: Bosnia's Vedad Ibisevic scores through the legs of Argentina's Sergio Romero . So overwhelming was Argentina’s occupation of Brazil’s famous stadium that we might have been in Buenos Aires. At . the start the men from the Balkans seemed awestruck  by the huge . atmosphere and Kolasiinac, still a teenager until next week’s birthday, . presented Argentina with that Father’s Day  gift of a third minute own . goal. Strangely, . though, that mishap settled the Bosnians to their now uphill task. Argentina, meanwhile, were slack and unco-ordinated in possession and . distracted at the back. The under-dogs – less star-power, superior organisation – frequently gave the second favourites kittens. Great expectations: Argentinian football fans watch their side win . Messi, . for whom this is supposed to be his optimum World Cup, was as nervous . as any of them, In brutal truth he was  having something close to a . nightmare for more than an hour. Then he found the magic with a typical . jinking run and classic low shot in off a post and all was forgiven. Well, for the moment at least. There . are yet sterner tests awaiting in the knock-out phases but the fits . induced by the Bosnians will nag at the Messi men as they move on. And . although he is a more stable and humble personage than Diego Maradona, . some of that Hand of God arrogance still runs as undercurrent through . Argentina’s psyche. They . were complacent after the early present, even though they were often in . all sorts of trouble. Then the ego which had been in danger of . crash-landing took flight again as soon as Messi put them two up. The late Bosnian goal which brought on more panic for the final five minutes should be a lesson but do they never learn? Messi . ‘s solo had saved the three points, as well as sparing the tournament . its first draw going into its fifth day. But it will take more than this . if Argentina are going to win their third World Cup – and if he is ever . to ranked up there in the pantheon of all-time greats with Pele, di . Stefano, Garrincha --- and, of course, Maradona. Still it has to be acknowledged that they honoured the spirit of what is now undeniably the greatest show on earth.

"For decades, experts thought that an extinct group of mammals known as anthracobunidae were related to the ancestors of modern elephants and sea cows. But  fossils believed to belong to a large land mammal that lived 48 million years ago, have led to experts disputing this theory. The discovery of bones from the ancient creature has led scientists to identify a new branch of mammals closely related to modern horses, rhinos and tapirs. Two jaws and other bones (pictured) have led scientists to identify a new branch of mammals closely related to modern horses, rhinos and tapirs - known as anthracobunidae - that lived in India and Pakistan about 48 million years ago . The mammals, known as anthracobunidae, lived in India and Pakistan and, until now, were commonly considered to be the ancestors of modern elephants and manatees. But this idea had puzzled experts from a geographical point of view, as elephants and their relatives are groups that are known to originate from Africa, not Asia. The new fossils indicate that anthracobunids are in fact related to the tiny tapirs that originated in Asia. The mammals, known as anthracobunidae, lived in India and Pakistan and, until now, were commonly considered to be the ancestors of modern elephants and manatees. This image shows one of the jaw bones that led to this theory being thrown out . Scientists have now identifed a new branch of mammals closely related to modern horses (pictuerd left) rhinos and tapirs (pictured right). The new fossils indicate that anthracobunids are in fact related to the tiny tapirs that originated in Asia . Anthracobunidae are an extinct group of mammals. They lived some 48 million years ago in what is now India and Pakistan. For decades, scientists thought they were related to the ancestors of modern elephants and sea cows. Now experts say they are closely related to modern horses, rhinos and tapirs. This makes more sense because elephants and their relatives are groups that are known to originate from Africa, not Asia. However, the smaller tapir is known to have originated in Asia. Researchers  analysed isotopes and the shape of the bones to find that these animals most likely fed on land and were large and lumbering. They did however spend a considerable amount of time near water, in a similar way to modern rhinos and tapirs, according to the study, which was published in the journal Plos One. Dr Lisa Noelle Cooper, of Northeast Ohio Medical University, who led the study, said: ‘Anthracobunids are just one of many lineages of vertebrates that evolved from terrestrial animals, but then left to live in a shallow water habitat and had thick bones. ‘These thick bones probably acted like ballast to counteract body buoyancy. You can see that kind of bone structure in modern hippos, otters, penguins, and cormorants.’ Co-author Erik Seiffert, of Stony Brook University in New York, said: ‘The evidence that has been accumulating from fossils and genes strongly suggests that the ancestor of elephants and sea cows lived in Africa, and at a time when that continent was totally isolated, so anthracobunids’ Asian distribution was hard to explain.’ The previous theory that anthracobunidae were related to elephants had puzzled scientists because elephants and their relatives are groups that are known to originate from Africa, not Asia .","Scientists from Northeast Ohio Medical University Stony Brook University in New York came up with the new theory .

"Kurdish protesters who today staged a mock ISIS-style execution in London  after Alan Henning was killed by the terror group have been blasted for mocking his death. Two men were pictured wearing blood-spattered orange jumpsuits with knives held to their throats outside Downing Street today as part of Kurdish protests demanding stronger action against ISIS. However their actions have been 'condemned' by a Muslim group, who said Mr Henning's death should not be used for political gain. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Kurdish anti-war protesters stage mock ISIS-style beheadings outside Downing Street today . Anger: The demonstration came just a day after Alan Henning was beheaded by ISIS fighter Jihadi John . Opposition: The demonstrators, some of whom have been on hunger strike since Wednesday, are demanding more heavy weapons to help Kurdish fighters defeat ISIS . Mohammed Shafiq, the cheif executive of the Ramadan Foundation, said: 'I think anyone who has seen the outpouring of grief today will be totally disgusted by anyone who is staging mock executions. 'The Kurdish activists have a right to protest and demand extra weapons, what they do not have the right to do is mock Mr Henning’s death and recreate the execution. 'We reject this and condemn it without hesitation. What today should be about is Barbara and Mr Henning's family, not about trying to use the death for political gain.' Several hundred Kurdish activists, some of whom have been on hunger strike in central London since Wednesday, are demanding heavy weapons and anti-tank missiles for use against ISIS. They fear the town of Kobani, on the Syria-Turkey border, is about to be overrun by the terror group, which could lead to another massacre. Their actions are likely to increase the emotional strain on Alan Henning's family, who have already said they are 'numb with grief'. Paying tribute to her husband today, Barbara Henning said: 'As a family we are devastated by the news of his death. There are few words to describe how we feel at this moment. 'Myself, Lucy and Adam, and all of Alan's family and friends are numb with grief.Alan was a decent, caring human being. His interest was in the welfare of others. 'He will be remembered for this and we as a family are extremely proud of him and what he achieved and the people he helped.' Mr Henning's brother also expressed hatred for the terrorists, describing the killers as 'scum', and saying he hoped they 'get what's coming to them'. Protest: Some activists have vowed to go on hunger strike outside Downing Street until their demands are met . Violent: A man brandishing a bloodied axe stages a mock-execution on the pavement outside Downing Street . Hurt: The protest will likely cause further hurt to Mr Henning's family who say they are already 'numb with grief' Elsewhere today the Stop the War Coalition also organised a march to Donwing Street, calling for Britain to halt it's bombing campaign against ISIS in Iraq. Holding placards that say 'stop bombing Iraq' and 'don't attack Syria', activists branded the attacks on Islamic State 'insane'. Referring to the brutal murder of British aid worker Alan Henning at the hands of Islamic State Francis O'Neill, 36, from Oxford said he had 'every sympathy' with his family, but said dropping bombs is not the answer. Mr O'Neill said Britain inflicts 'equal barbarity' on the people of Iraq, but people here feel 'distanced' from it. 'Whether you see someone being beheaded or being hit by a drone strike...It makes no difference.' RAF jets began bombing missions against militant positions in Iraq a week ago and David Cameron announced that two more Tornado bombers will join the mission on Thursday. Mr Cameron has said he is also considering extending bombardments to Syria, the stronghold of ISIS, where the U.S. and other allies are already attacking. However, the Prime Minister has said he will seek fresh parliamentary approval before doing so.","Activists in blood-spattered jumpsuits had plastic knives held to their throats .

One moose walks away after the fight while the other (not pictured) stands in the yard . But the time the filmmaker catches up, one moose is calmly walking away while the other stands his ground by the house. The incident occurred during the rut, or mating season, for the moose.

"Britain's intelligence services have been given controversial instructions to spy on confidential communications between lawyers and clients, it has been revealed. Top secret documents suggest MI5, MI6 and GCHQ may have illegally intercepted telephone calls and emails in sensitive security cases – even though lawyer-client relationships are protected by strict rules. The guidelines – branded by MP David Davis as a ‘national scandal’ – sparked fury because these communications are generally covered by ‘legal professional privilege’ to protect privacy and the right to a free trial. Top secret documents suggest intelligence services GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 have been given instructions to spy on confidential communications between lawyers and clients . It was disclosed yesterday through a tribunal that GCHQ guidelines said its staff ‘may in principle target the communications of lawyers’, while an MI5 document said that ‘in principle’ legally privileged material could be used ‘just like any other item of intelligence’. All the guidelines stressed careful consideration and justification for using the material. Campaigners said the revelations had ‘troubling implications for the whole British justice system’. The papers were released following a claim brought on behalf of two Libyan men - Abdul Hakim Belhaj and Sami al-Saadi – who accuse the British government of being complicit in kidnapping them and sending them back to Libya to be tortured. The men brought a claim to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), which examines complaints against the intelligence services and government surveillance, over concerns that their private discussions were being eavesdropped.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Four of the last five league meetings between Burnley and Hull City have ended with a 1-0 scoreline. Hull City won the last meeting between the two sides at Turf Moor in March 2013, but this ended a run of seven straight wins for the Clarets over the Tigers. Burnley have scored with a lower proportion of their shots than any other team in the Premier League (6 per cent). Burnley are the 10th side to fail to win any of their opening 10 Premier League matches of a single season. Three of the previous nine have survived. The last time Burnley and Hull met in the top flight, the Clarets won 4-1 in an April 2010 KC Stadium meeting . Hull City have won just one of their last 10 Premier League away matches (W1 D4 L5). Burnley have won just two of their last 18 home games in the Premier League (W2 D7 L9). This is the 57th league meeting between Burnley and Hull but only the third in the top-flight. After scoring in each of their opening eight Premier League games this season, Hull have now failed to score in their last two. A defeat in this game will see Burnley match the record of their arch-rivals Blackburn in the 1996-97 season (W0 D4 L7). Rovers managed to avoid relegation that campaign. Hull are the only Premier League team this season who don’t have at least one player to have featured in every minute of every game.","Steven Reid available to be selected by Burnley boss Sean Dyche .

"Boxing legend Mike Tyson's new cartoon show - in which he solves Scooby Doo-style crimes alongside an alcoholic talking pigeon and a ghost - has premiered to some early harsh reviews. The Cartoon Network's Adult Swim show, called Mike Tyson's Mysteries, features Tyson voicing himself alongside a talking pigeon, the Ghost of the Marquess of Queensbury and his adopted daughter Yung Hee. Although it was well received when it premiered at this July's Comic-Con event in San Diego, early reviews have labelled it bizarre, insane and anarchic. Scroll down for video .

Tyson punches plenty of people, monsters and animals throughout the cartoon series . Tyson pictured wearing a cowboy costume from a scene in the cartoon Mike Tyson's Mysteries . Pictured is Tyson fighting a monster. Images taken from the show reveal he puts his skills to good use . In the cartoon, Tyson's character is drawn in his blue training tracksuit complete with facial tattoo. Episode one was inexplicably centered around novelist Cormac McCarthy enlisting Tyson's help to fix a case of writer's block and provide the end to his latest novel. It also featured a chupacabra - which Tyson punched - as well as a centaur, tyrannosaurus rex and pterodactyl. The makers appear to rely on the show's absurdity to generate laughs, but many noted Tyson's inability to pronounce 'Cormac McCarthy' was a highlight. Besides the cartoon, Tyson has taken a number of acting roles in film and television and appeared in The Hangover back in 2009.

"A rough sleeper died today after being impaled on the railings outside David Cameron's parish church. A passer-by discovered the motionless body of the homeless 38-year-old in an alley by St Mary Abbots Church in Kensington at around 6.35am this morning. Paramedics could not revive the man,   and firefighters were called to free him from the railings. Tragedy: Scotland Yard revealed today that a unnamed man has died after he was impaled on a fence outside David Cameron's parish church in Kensington . Rescue effort: Paramedics could not revive the man and firefighters had to cut him free from the railings outside St Mary Abbots Church . David Cameron and his wife Samantha worship at St Mary Abbots Church, and their children were baptised there and go to the school next door. Scotland Yard said this afternoon the death is unexplained but not suspicious. Homeless Dave Redmond,39, said : 'The police came up to me this morning just after 8am and asked me if I know any homeless guys who sleep in the church gardens. Happy day: David Cameron and his wife Samantha after the christening of their daughter Florence R at St Mary Abbots Church . 'At first I thought that somebody had broken into the church or something stupid like that. But then I saw two forensic vans turn up and I thought it must be something more serious. But what a terrible way to go'. Local Resident Nick Selmes, 43, a property consultant, saw the aftermath of the death. 'I went to the gym about six and there was nothing then - no police or fire crews and no cordon - but when I returned there were several police vehicles and ambulances,' he told the Evening Standard. 'It's a tragedy and shocking that someone could lose their life in such a horrific way'. One woman who lives just off of Kensington High Street and asked not be named, said : 'Oh my god, that is so sad and so close to the school. I'm so glad the kids are on half-term and didnt see anything. And that is the school where David Cameron's kid goes to as well. 'It is really sad. Why was that poor man trying to climb the fence?' She added: 'I am really shocked because it is is normally busy at most times of the day. People normally cut through here to get to and from Kensington High Street.' Another local resident, a man in his 40s, who also asked not to be named, said his daughter goes to the school. He said: 'I'm really glad that it is half-term because if the body was discovered during term time it would be full of school children around here'. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'The body of the man, who has yet to be identified, was impaled on railings. The man was pronounced dead at the scene. 'There is nothing at this very early stage to indicate that the death is suspicious. Officers are at the scene and their inquires continue.' Theory: Police are investigating whether the man was homeless and trying to get in or out of the locked church gardens . Beautiful: The church is where the Camerons worship and his children go to the linked state primary. The Prime Minister had a memorial built for his son Ivan built inside after his death . The spokesman added: 'We think he may have been climbing the railings but because it only happened this morning we still have police work to do.' A spokesman from the London Fire Brigade said: 'The victim is approximately 55 year old male. 'At the scene he was found unconscious, not breathing and no vital signs. He was pronounced dead at the scene.' St Mary Abbots Church is the Prime Minister's parish church and his children go to the prestigious linked state primary school, just off High Street Kensington. The Camerons snubbed 15 other primaries closer to their Notting Hill home. It has 210 pupils, mainly from families of professionals, such as high-flying media figures and architects and an enviable record of being a feeder for fee-paying schools. In 2012, three years after the heartbreaking death of their six-year-old son Ivan, David and Samantha Cameron  unveiled a memorial to him there. In a moving tribute to their son, who suffered severe cerebral palsy, the couple commissioned an arched altar made from English oak. It bears an inscription on each edge which reads: 'Remember before God 2002 — Ivan Cameron — 2009. A child greatly loved.'","Victim found dead by passer-by outside St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington .

"George Osborne is on course to break his promise to cut borrowing as new figures show the deficit rose by £1.6 billion in September. Since April the Chancellor has borrowed more each month than the same time last year, with income and wealth taxes down. The Treasury had been expected to cut borrowing by 12 per cent in 2014-15, but experts said it was 'ever more unlikely' to meet to target. New figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility show borrowing has been higher each month since April than the same time last year . New data from the Office for National Statistics borrowing in September, excluding the effects of bank bail-outs, was £11.8 billion, £1.6 billion ahead of the same month in 2013. It means that halfway through the financial year, the Treasury looks well behind the target for a 12 per cent fall in the annual deficit expected by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Total borrowing for April to September stands at £58 billion, 10 per cent higher than for the same period in 2013-14. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: 'The Government's current fiscal problems largely reflect the fact that much weaker-than-expected earnings growth has limited income tax receipts, along with a large number of people now being in low-paid jobs or self-employed. The figures are a blow for Chancellor George Osborne who hopes to go into the next election claiming borrowing is down . 'The Chancellor is looking ever more unlikely to meet his fiscal targets for 2014-15.' Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie said: 'These figures are a serious blow to George Osborne. 'Not only is he set to break his promise to balance the books by next year, but borrowing in the first half of this year is now 10 per cent higher than the same period last year. 'As the OBR said last week, stagnating wages and too many people in low-paid jobs are leading to more borrowing.' Taxes on income and wealth for September of £13.1 billion were flat on the same month last year and just 0.6 per cent ahead for the year to date. Within this, revenues from income tax and capital gains tax rose 2.2 per cent for the month and 0.1 per cent for the year to date. OBR chairman Robert Chote has warned that the squeeze on pay growth is hitting the Government's revenues from income tax despite record numbers in work. Annual pay growth has been lagging behind inflation since 2008 and latest official figures showed it was just 0.7 per cent. Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said: 'The continued run of poor UK public borrowing figures looks set to severely hamper the Chancellor's ability to announce giveaways to address his party's deficit in the national opinion polls before next year's general election.' The ONS figures suggested that the buoyant property market was continuing to have a positive effect on public finances. Stamp duty on land and property continued to boost the Government's coffers, rising to £1.1 billion for September, matching a high in July that was a seven-year record. Revenues from this were up £1.5 billion, or 34 per cent, to £5.9 billion for the April to September period. The Treasury hoped to cut borrowing to £86.6billion in 2014-15, something which now looks increasingly unlikely . Total receipts were 3.1 per cent ahead to £46 billion, though for the year to date they are 0.4 per cent behind at £287.1 billion. Spending for September rose by 3.7 per cent from £51.1 billion to £53 billion. Underlying public sector debt was £1.451 trillion, or 79.9 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), compared to 79.2 per cent last month and 77.9 per cent in September last year. A Treasury spokesman said: 'We have seen stronger growth in receipts this month, but as today's figures show, the impact of the great recession is still being felt in our economy and the public finances. 'At the same time, we have to recognise that the UK is not immune to the problems being experienced in Europe and other parts of the world economy.' TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'It's time for George Osborne to admit he got his strategy wrong. Today's figures show the deficit getting bigger as tax revenues dry up. 'The 90,000 people who marched through the streets of London on Saturday calling for a pay rise understand that it's not just British workers who need wages to go up, but that's what the Treasury and the economy needs too. 'Only a wages-led recovery can bring about the boost in demand that businesses need and the boost in revenue that the Government needs to cut the deficit and invest for the future.'","Borrowing in September was £1.6billion higher than same time last year .

"The president of the Ghana Football Association has denied agreeing for the national team to play in matches that others were preparing to fix. An undercover investigation by Channel 4's Dispatches and The Telegraph identified two people, one a licensed FIFA agent and the other a Ghana club official, who said they could fix friendly matches involving the national side, who are currently involved in the World Cup, for £100,000. The report claimed that GFA president Kwesi Nyantakyi had agreed for Ghana to play in two proposed matches after the World Cup, but he has denied that in an interview with the BBC World Service. Let's dance: Ghana drew 2-2 with Germany on Saturday at the World Cup after an impressive performance . 'The contents of the publication are . not wholly true.' Nyantakyi told the Newsday programme. 'I was sent a . press enquiry from the newspaper and I provided a full account of what . transpired. It's unfortunate that they did not report fully what I told . them. 'First of all I . have not agreed to any match-fixing deal involving the FA. I was given a . draft contract which I indicated to their agent that I hadn't read and I . also had some issues with it and so it will be premature for anybody to . say the FA is at fault.' The Telegraph . reported that, during a meeting with an undercover reporter, Nyantakyi . had said he was happy with a proposed contract for two friendly matches . which would have seen match officials appointed by a bogus investment . firm, a breach of FIFA rules. But Nyantakyi said he did not read the contract and only submitted it to the GFA's lawyers to see if it was worth pursuing. Centre of attention: The Ghana squad in training on Sunday . 'I . didn't read it at all... I did not read the contract at all,' he said. 'They told me it was an investment company that was interested in buying . the rights to our matches and that the matches will be organised by a . FIFA match agent... 'When . the draft contract was submitted to me it was forwarded to the lawyers . to look at it because we need to know their position before we can sign. If they say okay, I read it to satisfy myself that all is okay. But I . cannot read it and decide on my own to sign without the OK from the . lawyer and the committee.' When news of the investigation first broke on Sunday night, the GFA . issued a statement saying it had called in the police to investigate two . people for misrepresentation. A statement from the GFA said: 'The Ghana Football Association (GFA) has requested the Ghana Police Service to investigate two persons for . misrepresenting the GFA with an attempt to defraud. 'The two were also allegedly filmed claiming that they would bribe GFA officials to ensure that the contract is signed. 'We . wish to state that the GFA did not sign the contract as we waited for . the response from the legal committee and that the two gentlemen did not . make such corrupt offers to the GFA or its officials. ""We wish to . assure the public that we will not tolerate such misrepresentations and . we will seek strong sanctions against such individuals if such claims . are found to be true.' Ghana's . hopes of progressing to the knock-out stages of the World Cup are still . alive after Portugal's stoppage-time equaliser against the United . States on Sunday night left everything to play for in Group G. But Nyantakyi claimed the fixing scandal had been deliberately timed to hurt his country at the World Cup. 'It . is a well-orchestrated plan to punish the hard-won reputation of the . Ghanaian FA and also to try and devalue the participation of the country . at the World Cup and it's not acceptable at all,' he said.

"A rancher is pictured standing over the remains of a man from El Salvador - his body left to decay beneath the blistering Texas sun. Lavoyger Durham manages 13,000 acre El Tule ranch in Brooks County, about 100 miles from the southernmost tip of Texas. It has become a pathway for undocumented immigrants who are desperate to make a life for themselves in the U.S. The unidentified man, now nothing more than a skeleton and scraps of clothes, was abandoned by the smugglers who helped him to cross the border into the country illegally. Though it is not on the border with Mexico, Brooks County does have a federal checkpoint on a major highway - where officials regularly stop vehicles in search of migrants trying to enter the country illegally. Smugglers bypass the checkpoint by making immigrants walk around it, through private ranches - such as the one Mr Durham manages - where temperatures regularly top 38 degrees Celsius. It has become a popular route for migrants from Central America - all coming into the country in pursuit of the great American Dream. The migrants are often told that the journey is quick and easy - and set off with little more than the clothes on their back and bottles of water.  But on those long walks, through the arid Texas terrain, many would-be immigrants die of heat exhaustion, dehydration, and exposure. Their bodies are left to rot by the smugglers, who are for the most part paid before they take migrants across the border. Last year, Border Patrol documented 445 deaths of migrants coming to the United States — the third-highest number since 1998.

"Diego Maradona thinks Iker Casillas is no longer the world class goalkeeper he once was, and even says that Jose Mourinho was right to drop the Real Madrid captain during his time in the Spanish capital. Spain captain Casillas was at fault for two goals as Spain were routed 5-1 by Holland on Friday and there were even questions as to whether Manchester United's David De Gea should replace him in goal for the world champions. And the 33-year-old Real Madrid man was caught out in the Champions League final for Diego Godin's opener that almost cost his club their La Decima title in Lisbon. VIDEO Scroll down for Casillas pushed hard in training with Reina and De Gea available . Flop: Casillas' invincible aura is slipping and after a decade at the top he is now under fire from all angles . Casillas has undergone a tumultuous couple of years at Madrid where he was undisputed number one for more than a decade before Jose Mourinho cut him from his preferred starting line-up in favour of Diego Lopez. Last season under Carlo Ancelotti he failed to regain his place - aside from in cup competitions - and now one of the game's greats is questioning his ability. Maradona, winner of 1986 World Cup with Argentina, told Telesur that he felt the Real stopper was no longer one of the top players in his position. Firepower: Arjen Robben waltzed round Casillas to score and he was at fault for two goals in the defeat . 'He had the worst game I've ever seen in my life,' he said. 'It reminds me of what my friend Mourinho told everyone about him. 'He said Casillas wasn't the right keeper and he paid for that. He had to leave, but in the end it turns out that Mourinho was right.' Despair: While Casillas struggles to cope with the 5-1 defeat, the Dutch players and fans celebrate . Smug: According to Maradona, Mourinho was right all along about Casillas' ability as number one . Mourinho, now back in England as Chelsea manager, quit Real at the end of the 2012/13 season with his relationship with the players in tatters, according to reports in Spain. But Maradona's words and Casillas' decent performances in two of the biggest games of the season will leave the Portugese boss feeling justified in his decision. Casillas has been linked with a move to Arsenal this summer as he looks to re-establish himself as a first choice goalkeeper in Europe.

As starts go, it doesn't get any better for Louis van Gaal. The Dutchman will want to hit the ground running next season and the fixture list has provided him with the best possible opportunity to do that. United do not face any of their expected title or Champions League qualification rivals until they welcome Everton on October 4. However, a sequence of games that will see them face Tottenham, Liverpool, Aston Villa, Manchester City, Chelsea and Everton from March 14 will surely determine their destiny. As will their clash against Arsenal on the penultimate weekend of the season. Verdict: Winners . Easy going: Manchester United's start to next season is a lot kinder than 'noisy neighbours' City .

Burnley (a) - 16 August . Leicester City (h) - 23 August . Everton (a) - 30 August . Swansea (h) - 13 September . Manchester City (a) - 20 September . Jose Mourinho would certainly have settled for this opening. A trip to newly-promoted Burnley awaits them on the opening day before the welcome fellow new-boys Leicester City to Stamford Bridge. Away games against Everton and champions Manchester City will provide the West London club with a much sterner test during their first six fixtures - but on the whole Mourinho will be rubbing his hands together. Their run-in, however, isn't as kind as Chelsea face potential title clashes against Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United in their during their final six games. Verdict: Winners .

It doesn't look likely that the Gunners will replicate last season's blistering start that saw them win five of their first six games. Their opening day clash against Crystal Palace should herald three points - but a trip to Goodison Park follows while clashes against champions Manchester City and north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur will test their early season title credentials by the time October comes around. Their run-in isn't entirely kind either, with games against Manchester United and Chelsea among their final five fixtures. Verdict: Winners .

Five of their first six fixtures are in London - including the mouth watering north London derby against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on September 27. On the whole, Pochettino will be satisfied with his side's start to the season, with the clash against Arsene Wenger's side, perhaps, the only daunting fixture during the first two months of the season. Their final day encounter against Everton could have a lot riding on it, though. Verdict: Winners .

It could have been better for Roberto Martinez, but it could certainly have been a lot worse. An away trip to Premier League new-boys Leicester City awaits them on the opening day, while early games against West Brom and Crystal Palace shouldn't fill the Toffees with too much dread. But games against Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool during their first six fixtures isn't ideal for the Goodison Park club.

Real Madrid frontman Ronaldo is still modelling but has this time been relegated to the role of a mannequin in a shop window while Rooney has become a fisherman working on the docks. Ibrahimovic, meanwhile struggles to sell old copies of his autobiography and moans: 'I am Zlatan, or I used to be.' However, Brazil legend Ronaldo - the all-time leading World Cup goalscorer with 15 goals - decides he must save the game by rescuing the players for a winner-takes-all clash against the clones. Gathering the players in a secret hideout, the former Inter Milan and Real Madrid striker has a job on his hands convincing the eight players that they are capable of beating the clones. 'We all want to beat the clones but they're unbeatable,' stressed Rooney and Zlatan agrees. Ronaldo insists the players must 'risk everything' to reclaim the game with a passionate battle cry and gets the players on board - despite the fact the players will never play football again should the lose.

"The Deputy Prime Minister shares the use of Chevening House with Foreign Secretary William Hague as a perk of his Cabinet position . Nick Clegg's plan to introduce a mansion tax on expensive properties would mean a charge of £150,000 a year on his country retreat Chevening House, it was revealed last night. The Deputy Prime Minister is entitled to use Chevening, which has 115 rooms and is set in 3,500 acres of Kent countryside, as a perk of his Cabinet position. Under the Liberal Democrats’ policy, which will be reaffirmed at the party’s spring conference next weekend, the owners of properties worth more than £2 million would have to pay an annual tax equivalent to one per cent of the value, an idea the Tories have condemned as a ‘tax on aspiration’. Chevening, built in 1615, has an estimated market value of £15 million and Government sources have confirmed that other grace-and-favour homes used by senior Cabinet Ministers, including the Prime Minister’s country residence Chequers and the Chancellor’s weekend retreat Dorneywood, would also be hit by the charge. Ministers could make special provision to exempt the homes from the charge, but would leave themselves open to accusations of hypocrisy. According to the House of Commons Library, council tax at Chevening is the responsibility of the Chevening Trust, which has run the stately home since 1967 when it was left to the nation by Lord Stanhope. However, last night a spokesman for Mr Clegg said: ‘Council tax is currently paid at Chevening House but it is met by the Government, rather than the trustees. 'Given the current arrangements, if a mansion tax was introduced, it is highly likely there would be no loss of revenue – as it would be paid by the Government to the Government, as is already the case for many other taxes.’ Chevening House, built in 1615, has an estimated market value of £15 million .","The Deputy Prime Minister is entitled to use Chevening House - worth £15m .

"Authorities say a Pennsylvania man provided bad information to police about the suspect accused of killing a state trooper. Michael Abuiso was charged Friday in Monroe County with making false reports and related counts. According to a complaint, Abuiso lied to police by saying suspect Eric Frein asked him in August for a forged identity in order to enter Canada. But the entire account was made up, Abuiso later admitted, and he had never even met Frein and may have been trying to buy leverage on previous charges he faced, according to authorities. Michael Abuiso allegedly lied to police by saying suspect Eric Frein asked him in August for a forged identity in order to enter Canada . Frein has been on the run from authorities since a trooper was fatally ambushed Sept. 12 outside his Pocono Mountains barracks. Another officer was injured. Authorities say Abuiso first lied to Barrett Township police, then repeated the claim to troopers Sept. 18 before acknowledging it wasn't true. A message left for the 48-year-old Canadensis resident wasn't immediately returned. It's not clear if he has a lawyer. Police are still searching for him more than a month after he shot dead a trooper and seriously injured another. The post office is near Pocono Mountain East High School, Frein's old school. A woman out for a walk on Friday night spotted a rifle-toting man with a mud-covered face at the school. Wanted: Eric Frein might have been spotted on Monday, just days after he was seen near his old school Friday. Police released these images showing what Frein could look like after weeks of eluding authorities . On Tuesday morning, police swarmed around a clothing bin, which is used to collect clothing donations, in Swiftwater before moving on. The Pocono Mountain School District also decided to cancel classes for Tuesday - even though officials said on Monday they would remain open. State Police Trooper Tom Kelly explained classes were called off 'as a result of the police activity in the area of the school'. Authorities had been searching for him in the woods around his parents' home in Canadensis but shifted their primary search area five or six miles to the southwest after Friday night's sighting. Lt. Col. George Bivens said over the weekend that police have put a 'tremendous amount of pressure on him' and likely forced him to move.","Michael Abuiso was charged Friday in Monroe County with making false reports and related counts .

"James Der Derian, Director of the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney, said the website 'alert people to the dark side of the internet' A top security expert says a website exposing CCTV footage from hundreds of Australian businesses and homes is a good thing 'to alert people to the dark side of the internet'. James Der Derian, Director of the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney, made the comments after website insecam.com was launched revealing 924 CCTV camera streams across the country. The website is running more than 70,000 streams from security cameras monitoring businesses, building sites, factories and homes and is available for anyone on the internet to view. The site is running 924 Australian feeds from cameras which have not had their password changed from factory settings without the knowledge of the owners of the cameras. Mr Der Derian said this sort of website was always going to be 'inevitable'. The security expert told Daily Mail Australia: 'Everyone thinks the internet is this perfect way of communicating. 'The whole idea of the internet is a way of access and unless you have very strong password protection and encryption then this kind of exposure is inevitable. The website insecam.com is running footage from more than 73,000 cameras round the world . Security experts say members of the internet need to beware of the pitfalls of the internet . Owners of the cameras have no idea that their footage is being streamed for the whole world to see online . 'This was always going to be likely.Everyone relies on the internet for security, communications, and protection. 'This shows that it has got a flip side and people uploading personal details need to be careful, this website is an example of that. 'It does not surprise me and it is a good thing to alert people to the darker side of the internet. People are so willing to give up personal information.' Internet protocol cameras, or IP cameras, are the ones being streamed on the website and they are seen as a cheaper option than CCTV camera systems, reports ABC. The site is streaming cameras which have not had their factory passwords changed . The cameras are located in businesses, factories, building sites and private homes . The website is running footage from CCTV from seven Domino's Pizza restaurants in Queensland and 'immediate action' has been taken. Domino's chief operations officer Andrew Megson told ABC: 'Domino's has been alerted to the CCTV footage from one of its stores viewable online and moved to change the passwords and shut down the live footage immediately.' Staff were seen making pizzas and conversing with customers in the footage.","The website insecam.com is running footage from more than 73,000 cameras round the world .

"When: Saturday November 8, 2.30pm . Where: Twickenham Stadium, London . What: QBE Series opener . Semesa Rokoduguni trained with his England team-mates on Thursday morning as Stuart Lancaster put his players through their paces ahead of Saturday's QBE Series opener against New Zealand. Stuart Lancaster is backing the uncapped wing and new father Dave Attwood to rise to the challenge of tackling world champions New Zealand at Twickenham on Saturday. England have named Rokoduguni on the right wing for the QBE Series opener and his Bath team-mate Attwood takes his place at lock after his fiancee gave birth to their first child on Tuesday. Semesa Rokoduguni breaks with the ball during the England training session held at Pennyhill Park on Thursday . Rokoduguni will make his England debut as England face New Zealand in the QBE Series opener on Saturday . Kyle Eastmond, wearing a pair of black running tights, runs with the ball during England's Thursday morning training session . England: M Brown (Harlequins); S Rokoduguni (Bath), B Barritt (Saracens), K Eastmond (Bath), J May (Gloucester); O Farrell (Saracens) , D Care (Harlequins); J Marler (Harlequins), D Hartley (Northampton), D Wilson (Bath), D Attwood (Bath), C Lawes (Northampton), T Wood (Northampton), C Robshaw (Harlequins, capt), B Vunipola (Saracens). Replacements: R Webber (Bath), M Mullan (Wasps), K Brookes (Newcastle), G Kruis (Saracens), B Morgan (Gloucester), B Youngs (Leicester), G Ford (Bath), A Watson (Bath). New Zealand: I Dagg; B Smith, C Smith, S B Williams, J Savea; A Cruden, A Smith; W Crockett, D Coles, O Franks, B Retallick, S Whitelock, J Kaino, R McCaw (capt), K Read. Replacements: K Mealamu, B Franks, C Faumuina, P Tuiipulotu, L Messam, T J Perenara, B Barrett, R Crotty . Fiji-born Rokoduguni, a serving soldier in the British Army with the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards who has seen action in Afghanistan, has been rewarded for an outstanding start to the season at Bath. And Lancaster expects the 27-year-old to take his chance in the injury-enforced absence of Manu Tuilagi. 'He is very composed and calm,' said Lancaster. 'He's dilligent, he's done his preparation. 'He has been on our radar for a while and there are a lot of stats that say he is topping every category. 'I'm delighted for Roko. Wing is an extremely competitive position, but he has pushed himself forward with his form this season and it's great to be able to give him this opportunity.' Rokoduguni is one of three uncapped players in the 23 with Bath team-mate Anthony Watson offering back-three cover from the bench and George Kruis of Saracens the second-row replacement. Lancaster has no qualms about the inclusion of Attwood, one of seven Bath players in the matchday squad, so soon after becoming a dad. 'He's got even more to play for this weekend now,' said Lancaster. 'He's absolutely fine. In fact the biggest worry would be if the baby hadn't arrived yet and if that would have played on his mind. 'He's had an eventful week. He's back with us now and will be ready to go for Saturday.' Danny Care and Owen Farrell form the half-backs with Farrell chosen despite being restricted to only two starts for Saracens this season because of a thigh strain. Lancaster said Farrell's performance in training had earned him his place ahead of George Ford. 'George has had a great season as well but Owen has been excellent in training. George will continue to push him and his opportunity will come at some point.' England coach Stuart Lancaster addresses the media following the training session with his players .

Lancaster is upbeat about England's prospects against an All Blacks side missing Dan Carter and with Sonny Bill Williams playing at inside centre. 'We are at home against a very high-quality team but we've got belief in our team as well. 'They are strong across the board, very experienced and with world-class players in a lot of positions. 'But it's not dissimilar to the side we played in the summer, the side we played this time last year or two years ago and, on each occasion, we either won or pushed them close.' England have selected a previously untried centre pairing of Kyle Eastmond - the Aviva Premiership's form player - and Brad Barritt.

Brad Barritt (above) will complete a new-look centre partnership with Eastmond on Saturday . Eastmond experienced mixed fortunes during the summer tour to New Zealand, excelling in the first Test only to be replaced at half-time of the third when his defensive frailties were exposed. Barritt's inclusion at outside centre provides England with an insurance policy as Lancaster views the Saracens midfielder as the best defensive back in the Premiership. Jonny May of Gloucester fills the left-wing slot despite a disappointing tour of New Zealand which placed his international future in doubt. Billy Vunipola (above) will be hoping to make an impact against the All Blacks on Saturday . England coach Stuart Lancaster looks on a he prepares his team for Saturday's QBE Series opener . England's pack, which has been decimated by injuries to the tight five, picked itself once the respective calf and thigh injuries carried by props David Wilson and Joe Marler cleared up. Attwood was the next in line to partner Courtney Lawes in the second row after Joe Launchbury was ruled out of the entire autumn schedule with a neck problem. Billy Vunipola has held off the number eight challenge from Ben Morgan to start in the back row with Chris Robshaw leading the team. After tackling the All Blacks, England face further autumn appointments with South Africa, Samoa and Australia.","Semesa Rokoduguni trains with England squad ahead of Saturday's clash against New Zealand .

"A Washington state man lashed out at police officers for their poor aim after he was allegedly involved in multiple shootings Wednesday. 'I wish I was dead; your guys aren't very good shots,' Hans Hansen said, according to court documents obtained by KCPQ. Hansen is accused of shooting at patrol vehicles and officers from Granite Falls, Lake Stevens, and Marysville. Scroll down for video . Suspect: Hans Hansen, seen in court, was reportedly suicidal on Wednesday when he fired at cops from three different police departments . Armed and dangerous? Authorities have said Hansen had eight guns on Wednesday, including two AK-47s and an AR-15 . Hansen's motive is believed by police to have been suicide, the affiliate station reported. The 43-year-old's potential leg amputation, a suicidal son, as well as a cabinet business going under were also reportedly revealed in the documents. In a Monday court appearance filmed by KCPQ, prosector Ed Stemler said 'The defendant indicated he was suicidal and wanted to die.' KCPQ reported the documents alleged that if Hansen wasn't prevented by police, he would have shot up Marysville Navy Support Complex. Stemler also said 'This was a very dangerous and violent outburst directed at police officers at multiple departments.' Authorities have said Hansen had eight guns on Wednesday, including two AK-47s and an AR-15, the affiliate station reported. According to The Daily Herald, an affidavit shows that Hansen claimed he faced a foreclosure on his home and fought with his wife on Wednesday before he drank alcohol - and that he admitted to the various shootings. Hansen is accused of shooting at multiple targets: first a building he was evicted from, then  at a Granite Falls patrol vehicle with no one inside, followed by the Lake Stevens police station and patrol vehicles for the department with no one inside, and later Marysville officers, the newspaper reported. Police arrested him for first-degree assault charges and drive-by shooting charges, though they have not yet been filed, the newspaper said.

"England's suspect defensive line was always going to be 'found out' and ultimately prove their undoing at the World Cup, according to former midfielder Paul Scholes. The Three Lions were put on the brink of an early plane back from Brazil following a 2-1 defeat to Uruguay in Sao Paulo on Thursday night, where Liverpool striker Luis Suarez netted a late winner after Wayne Rooney's equaliser. It was a second Group D loss and England's exit will be confirmed should Italy fail to beat Costa Rica on Friday. Scroll down for video... Weak link: England's defence got found out at the 2014 World Cup, according to Paul Scholes . Not guilty: Steven Gerrard should not be blamed for the backward header that allowed Luis Suarez to score . Scholes - capped 66 times for England and whom Fabio Capello tried to bring out of retirement ahead of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa - is in no doubt of the main reason why Roy Hodgson's squad could not deliver when it mattered. Writing in his blog for www.paddypower.com, former Manchester United star Scholes said: 'Going into the tournament we all feared the back four were never not going to concede goals - and now it has been proven. 'There is no way you can blame Steven Gerrard for not getting more on the ball from a header in the middle of the park for Luis Suarez's second goal. The defenders didn't sense the danger. 'Roy is close to finding something - but he needs two young centre-halves that have the balls to play, the balls to step into midfield now and again and full-backs who can defend. 'We have got two full-backs now in Leighton Baines and Glen Johnson who are great going forward - but we've got great forwards already. We need solid defenders and we're not blessed with great talent in this area. 'Not bringing Ashley Cole was probably a mistake - not so much for his attacking qualities - but more his defensive ones. Wrong choice? Would Ashley Cole (R) have provided better defensive cover than Leighton Baines? 'I think Baines and the whole of the back four have been found out a bit. It has been argued that John Terry could have steadied the ship and taken command - but he's not getting any younger either. 'Ideally what was needed was a young John Terry and a Rio Ferdinand in his prime to marshal the defence.' Scholes, 39, feels Everton starlet Ross Barkley, who impressed again when coming off the bench against Uruguay, should start against Costa Rica, in what could well be a dead rubber. 'I have said before that he'd be in my team but play him in the centre like he does for Everton - not out wide as a replacement for Raheem Sterling,"" Scholes added. Boy wonder: Paul Scholes has backed Ross Barkley (R) to start England's next game against Costa Rica . 'He'd be a direct replacement for Jordan Henderson. He's a good lad and has done okay, but has nowhere near the quality that Ross Barkley has. 'The Everton man would be a perfect fit for that central midfield role and would take a lot of the heavy lifting off Gerrard's shoulders. 'He can play off Gerrard, bomb forward, beat a man - give and take a pass. He'd be ideal for Wayne Rooney too and they could strike up a good partnership.' 'There's also Luke Shaw. Let's see how he handles the big occasion. The sad thing is it may be too little too late now to make these changes.'","England defence to blame for losing to Uruguay, claims Paul Scholes .

"England were condemned to a Black-wash at the end of a shattering season as a searing first-half blitz from New Zealand left them in a state of disarray and there was no way back. Julian Savea was the executioner-in-chief with a glorious hat-trick of tries, but his exploits were aided by the visitors’ failings. This was a game too far. This was the occasion when the wheels came off for an extended spell and a tour that had given such cause for long-term optimism appeared in danger of ending in humiliation. Ultimately, their fate was not as grisly as it may have been, but it was a miserable occasion nonetheless. At half-time, England were 23 points adrift on the scoreboard. They had conceded four tries as their defence was systematically dismantled by the rampant world champions. Such was the extent of the carnage; it looked as if the tourists’ fabled collective spirit had been left utterly broken. VIDEO New Zealand complete series whitewash . Hat-trick hero: Julian Savea races through to complete a 36-13 victory for New Zealand in third test . Different class: Aaron Smith, Ma'a Nonu and Aaron Cruden celebrate during New Zealand's third victory . Marched: Billy Vunipola walks off the field after being shown a yellow card in England's 36-13 third Test lost . That notion was dispelled by a . determined revival after half-time, but the improvement in the . performance did not equate to enough points to turn the contest on its . head. The All Blacks were not able to maintain their imperious . standards, but they had already re-asserted their supremacy en route to . claiming a 3-0 series win. England . will point to the close results in Auckland and Dunedin as evidence . that they have made strides on this trip, but in truth they will fly . home with more confusion than clarity. There is still no sign of the . coaches being absolutely certain about their best line-up – with . particular doubts about the midfield and wing selections. The . first half was arguably the worst 40-minute period of Stuart . Lancaster’s tenure – perhaps even more abject than the second-half . collapse in Cardiff last year. Rarely have his England team so meekly . succumbed to an avalanche of pressure. Even when they were pounded by . the Springboks in Johannesburg two years ago, the brutal mis-match . didn’t last so long. Four tries before the break wasn’t even a . sufficient illustration of New Zealand’s utter dominance. Questions: Chris Robshaw is helpless as Julian Savea scores a try during the tour that disappointed . Brace:  Julian Savea scored two tries as New Zrealand raced to a 29-6 half-time lead . Whiteash: New Zealand completed a Test whitewash and equalled their record of 17 consecutive Test wins . Savea . is becoming the man focal point for English nightmares with his scoring . feats in this fixture. The All Black wing had touched down five times . in three previous matches against Lancaster’s side and he continued his . solo onslaught within four minutes here. From . a lineout on the right, the hosts sent the ball in-field at pace to . Cruden, who passed on to Ben Smith – the hero of the victory in Dunedin . last weekend. The full back twisted past an isolated Chris Ashton and . released Savea, who charged over in the corner. A . Freddie Burns penalty reduced the arrears, but it was fleeting respite. New Zealand’s second try was a near-replica of the first, as they . circumvented the visitors’ narrow defence with alarming ease. Again it . came from a lineout on their right flank and when Cruden received the . ball from Richie McCaw he burst between Kyle Eastmond and Manu Tuilagi . to go clear in midfield. His . long pass fell in front of Savea but, despite the wet conditions, he . picked it up on the bounce and carved inside to score. That act of . individual brilliance was another stark indication of the continued gap . between these nations – these are the moments of ball-playing Kiwi . quality which their English rivals are simply unable to match at . present. Black-wash! Try heroes Julian Savea and Aaron Smith embrace Ben Smith after victory is won . Catch me if you can: Aaron Smith race to score a try during an awesome first-half for New Zealand . Touchdown! Aaron Smith scored two tries in the first half as the All Blacks dominated the visitors . You beauty! Aaron Smith of the All Blacks celebrates with Ben Smith and Richie McCaw after scoring a try . Astonishingly, . Savea should have had a hat-trick within 14 minutes when he took a pass . on the overlap to cross the line again, but the ball had travelled . forward. It was a fortunate let-off for England as the chance should . have been taken, but there were plenty more such openings to come. After . a penalty by Cruden, Billy Vunipola was sin-binned – somewhat dubiously . – for a high tackle on the home No 10 and the All Blacks made hay . against their depleted opponents. Dane Coles went close on the left, . then Malakai Fekitoa’s midfield break created mayhem, Cory Jane swerved . around Marland Yarde on the right and sent Aaron Smith in from close . range. The fourth Kiwi try . came five minutes before the break as Ma’a Nonu fed the ball to Ben . Smith and he left Burns and Yarde trailing in his wake before . off-loading for Aaron Smith to score his second try. Cruden’s conversion . made it 29-6 – and game, set and match – at half-time. When . England re-emerged for the second half, there was a change in . personnel, with Luther Burrell on for Eastmond, and a change in . intensity levels too. The interval had evidently led to the dishing out . of a few home truths and the tourists suddenly dredged up the will for . the fight. Sparks: There were flashes of brilliance from some players but England lost the series 3-0 . Consolation: Marland Yarde scores a try for England at the start of the second half . Powerhouse:  Malakai Fekitoa of New Zealand charges at Manu Tuilagi of England in his first Test start . Whitewash: Malakai Fekitoa helped New Zealand to a 3-0 Test whitewash against England . In the 43rd . minute, the wounded defiance led to a try. Joe Launchbury rampaged into . space in midfield and from his off-load, Ben Youngs scorched away before . passing on to Tuilagi. The Leicester centre drove strongly towards the . line, despite three defenders attempting to bring him down and from the . ruck, Yarde darted over to score for the second successive week. The . wing so nearly struck again two minutes later, when he exploded through . from the back of a lineout, but he was well held up over the line by . Jane. England’s spirited . rally stalled and they were forced to absorb a sustained period of New . Zealand pressure, but they did so with far greater conviction than in . the disastrous first half. When they re-emerged into enemy territory, . Yarde was once again the primary threat as his arcing run took him past . Nonu and into the home 22, before Burrell knocked on to squander a . scoring position. The . visitors continued to strive for a grandstand finish, but there was one . more indignity to come. The clock had reached 80 minutes when one last . All Black assault saw Jane audaciously off-load from the right to send . Savea clear to gleefully notch his third try of the night. It was . fitting that he was the one to have the last word. Piledriver!  Kieran Read of the All Blacks charges forward during the match in Hamilton .

"It’s been a busy old month for Thibaut Courtois. From playing a pivotal role for Atletico Madrid as they won La Liga for the first time in nearly two decades, and then finished runners-up in the Champions League to Real Madrid, to trying to decide where his club future lies. Jose Mourinho is beckoning for him to return to his parent club Chelsea ahead of next season, but first there is the small matter of a World Cup campaign with Belgium. His clean sheet in Belgium's 1-0 win against Russia was the 100th of his career – a remarkable achievement when you consider he has only just turned 22. Milestone: Thibaut Courtois makes a strong stop in the first half of Belgium's World Cup win against Russia . Safe hands: The Belgian commands his area well to punch a corner clear against Fabio Capello's men . The flamboyant Eden Hazard might be the standout 24-carat piece in Belgium’s ‘golden generation’, but Courtois is arguably just as valuable. The 6ft 6in shotstopper has reached the milestone in 218 games for club and country, meaning he has kept clean sheets in 45.87% of the games he has played in since making his debut for Genk in the Belgian Jupiler Pro League in 2009. Safe hands: Courtois, pictured with Toby Alderweireld and Vincent Kompany, before the Russia match . In comparison, Iker Casillas, considered one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time (regardless of his recent blip in form), had kept 73 clean sheets when he turned 22 in the summer of 2003. Benchmark: Iker Casillas in training ahead of Spain's final World Cup group stage match against Australia . Belgium have still never lost when Courtois has been in the side. That’s 19 games now.

"She will probably always be known as the half-naked cavorting star of Robin Thicke's steamy Blurred Lines video. But as she takes on a role in Gone Girl, one of the year's most hotly anticipated movies alongside industry heavyweights Ben Affleck and Rosamind Pike, Emily Ratajkowski is trying to make a new name for herself - as a Hollywood actress. The American model, who saw  her star rocket since being cast in the video for the controversial song featuring  T.I. and Pharrell last year, stars in Gone Girl - an adaptation of the 2012 novel by Gillian Flynn with a storyline that follows a husband (Ben Affleck) who is suspected of being involved in the disappearance of his wife. Scroll down for video . From model to Hollywood actress: Emily Ratajkowski has taken on a role in Gone Girl, one of the year's most hotly anticipated movies, alongside industry heavyweights Ben Affleck and Rosamind Pike . It was Hollywood star Affleck who suggested Emily for the role of Andie, a student who finds herself caught up in the investigation. 'It was amazing [working with Affleck],' Emily told Stylist magazine. 'He has so much patience for young people and it was a really good acting lesson for me.' The 23-year-old, who we are more accustomed to seeing undressed than dressed, says that her mother taught her that sexuality is a 'beautiful thing' and not to apologise for it. Remember this? Emily shot to  fame as the half-naked cavorting star of Robin Thicke's steamy Blurred Lines video last summer . Life lessons: The model says that her mother taught her that sexuality is a 'beautiful thing' and not to apologise for it . Her father, meanwhile, text her after her first ever nude shoot saying: ""I just saw the photos and you're as beautiful a model as you were as a five-year-old"".' And it seems that the model's parental support system has instilled great confidence in her. In the November issue of Cosmopolitan, which sees her pose on the cover, she claimed she can wear what she wants, sleep with whom she wants, and dance how she wants, while 'still being a feminist.' The 5ft 7in star has also recently been seen filming We Are Your Friends in Los Angeles alongside Zac Efron. The drama centres around a DJ trying to make the big time with his first hit track.

"Johanna Konta was the first British player to complete a match at Wimbledon this year - and the first to crash out, losing in three sets to Shuai Peng of China. Peng’s victory, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, took two hours and 15 minutes, sparking the start of a spate of early expected British exits at precisely 2pm. Konta, 23, is an Australian-born player of Hungarian descent who became a British citizen two years ago. She is ranked No 96 in the world and was expected to lose to a player ranked 35 places higher - although put up a fight on her way out. Out: Johanna Konta lost in three sets to Shuai Peng on the opening day . Almost: Konta chasing down a ball against Peng in their first round match . Playing out on Court No 12 in opening-day sunshine, Konta took the initiative early to break her opponent to love in the opening game. But she was immediately broken back, and by the end of the first set was nervous and over-cautious. A double-fault at game point, 40-30 up and serving to save the set highlighted that, and then Konta received a time violation warning for slow play. That marathon game included eight deuces but Peng prevailed when Konta netted a forehand. Konta started brightly again in the second set, again breaking Peng to love in the opener. This time she capitalised, breaking again for 3-1 before taking the set. But Peng was steadier and on the big points, more clinical. Konta goes home with a first-round loser’s cheque of £27,000. This is her third straight first-round defeat here following losses in 2012 and 2013. At full stretch: Peng had to work hard but eventually prevailed against the plucky Brit . Despite working closely with a sports psychologist, Konta admitted she failed to fend off the Wimbledon jitters. 'In the first set she handled the occasion much better than I did,' she said. 'I was playing with a little nerves, a lot of tension, I felt. Obviously when you play like that, you can't play at your best level.' Konta added: 'Obviously this game is very much mental. 'I am working with a sports psychologist, she's helping me a lot with how to handle situations, and that's obviously a work in progress.' Konta said it was tough to keep the positive aspect of breaking into the top 100 world rankings in mind in defeat. 'I'm not sure if it's consolation,' she said. 'Obviously it's a small milestone for me, so obviously I take a lot of pride in that, am very happy about that. 'But obviously that's not my main goal, I'm very much looking forward, wanting to keep moving forward.'","Johanna Konta battled hard but lost in three sets to China's Shuai Peng .

"A married couple in their 60s were found shot dead in their Orlando, Florida home and now local authorities are searching for their 30-year-old quadruple amputee son as a person of interest in their 'suspicious' deaths. The bodies of Michael and Nancy Petrozzino, 63 and 64, were discovered Tuesday morning, after the principal at the elementary school where Mrs Petrozzino taught second grade called 911 when she didn't show up for work. Soon after making the gruesome discovery, the Orange County Sheriff's Office held a press conference, asking about the whereabouts of the couple's son Sean Petrozzino, 30. Recent photo: Police on Wednesday released this surveillance shot of Petrozzino from when he withdrew cash at an ATM on Tuesday . Drove off? Police say Sean may be driving this red Toyota with a license plate number of 112VZY. Neighbors say it was Sean's father's car . Michael (left) and Nancy Petrozzino (right) were found dead in their Orange County, Florida home Tuesday morning . They say he may be driving a red Toyota with a license plate number of 112VZY, which neighbors say is his father's car. Sean Petrozzino has not yet been named as a suspect in the case, but police have named him a person of interest and believe he is armed and dangerous and possibly headed to south Florida. Sean (right) reportedly moved back home with his parents last week after breaking up with his wife Cynthia (left) Sean and his great Dane moved back in with his parents last week after separating from his wife. The former couple's home in Georgia is allegedly in foreclosure. Sean is also a quadruple amputee after a teenage bout with bacterial meningitis. In 2000, he underwent 13 surgeries to remove the infection which resulted in the loss of both his legs and he only has part of one hand left.  He is able to walk with the use of prosthetic limbs. 'I've known Sean since he was 16 years old,' mother in law Cathleen Horne told the Sentinel. 'This just seems bizarre. It seems like a bad dream.' 'We met Sean about a week-and-a-half ago,' neighbor Richard Ellwood told My Fox Orlando. 'He was introduced to me by Nancy as their son.' Mr Ellwood went on to describe the couple as nice people who had lived in the neighborhood for several years. 'It's difficult to imagine someone who would have that much rage, whoever did this,' he told WKMG. Before their deaths, Mr Petrozzino worked at Walt Disney World and his wife worked as a teacher at Andover Elementary School. Anyone with information about the son's whereabouts are being asked to call a Crimeline at 800-423-TIPS. The Orlando Sentinel spoke to Jerry L. Saunders of ABC Prosthetics and Orthotics, who verified that handless people indeed have the ability to fire a weapon. It's also known that Sean Petrozzino is able to manage other finer tasks such as using an ATM. Police verified this late Wednesday when they released surveillance footage of Petrozzino as he used an Orlando cash machine on Tuesday, most likely after his parents were slain. What's more, police are searching for Petrozzino as he's thought to potentially be on his way to South Florida and behind the wheel of his father's red Toyota.

"Marriott International will pay a $600,000 fine for jamming conference attendees' own Wi-Fi networks at its Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention Center, forcing them to pay hefty prices to use the hotel's own connection. Frequent travelers often carry personal Wi-Fi hotspots — tiny devices that can connect to the Internet via cell phone towers. For $50 a month, they can connect to the Internet on the move, often avoiding hefty fees charged by hotels, airports and conference facilities. Some people upgrade their wireless data plans to make their smartphones into hotspots. Scandal: Last year, a conference attendee at th eGaylord Opryland Resort and Convention Center, pictured, and found the hotel was jamming devices in its ballrooms . Last year, a conference attendee at the Opryland hotel in Nashville, Tennessee — which is managed by Marriott — found that the hotel was jamming devices in its ballrooms and complained to the Federal Communications Commission. In the complaint, the guest noted that the same thing happened previously at another Gaylord property. The block didn't affect Wi-Fi access in guest rooms. While jamming personal Wi-Fi connections, Marriott was charging conference organizers and exhibitors between $250 and $1,000, per access point, to use the Gaylord's Wi-Fi connection. The FCC declined to release the initial guest complaint except if requested under the Freedom of Information Act, a process that can often take weeks. Marriott agreed to the fine and has instructed its hotels not to use the jamming technology in the way it was used at Opryland, according to the FCC. But the company on Friday defended the blocking of guests' own Wi-Fi networks in the interest of network security. The company said it is legal to use FCC-approved technology to protect its Wi-Fi service against 'rogue wireless hotspots that can cause degraded service, insidious cyber-attacks and identity theft,' adding that hospitals and universities employee similar jamming practices. Marriott agreed to the fine and has instructed its hotels not to use the jamming technology in the way it was used at Opryland, according to the FCC . At the four Gaylord hotels in the U.S., Marriott today monitors for hotspots causing interference but does not automatically block such connections, said Harvey Kellman, a lawyer for the hotel company.  Only a handful of Marriott's 4,000 other hotels worldwide currently screen for hotspot interference. Marriott said it encourages the FCC to change its rules 'to eliminate the ongoing confusion' and 'to assess the merits of its underlying policy.' The government said people who purchase cellular data plans should be able to use them without fear that their personal connection will be blocked. 'It is unacceptable for any hotel to intentionally disable personal hotspots while also charging consumers and small businesses high fees to use the hotel's own Wi-Fi network,' Travis LeBlanc, chief of the FCC's enforcement bureau said in a statement. 'This practice puts consumers in the untenable position of either paying twice for the same service or forgoing Internet access altogether.'","Marriott International will pay a $600,000 fine for jamming conference attendees' own Wi-Fi networks at a Tennessee convention center .

"Amateur singers and community choirs are being asked to donate their voices to a charity single that will feature in the Christmas TV commercial for Waitrose. Thousands of voices will be overlaid on the song, which will be released for purchase on the basis that the profits will be split between three UK charities helping the elderly, children and those struggling to buy food. The song chosen for the TV first is the Dolly Parton track 'Try' and it will be produced David Kosten, who uses the name Faultline and has worked with the likes of Coldplay's Chris Martin, The Flaming Lips, and R.E.M's Michael Stipe. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Amateur singers can 'donate' their voices to Waitrose to be used in a new charity single . It will be heard hundreds of times as the backing track to the Waitrose Christmas commercial in the run up to December 25. The pressure is on retailers to come up with something different and memorable for their festive campaigns and Waitrose, which is part of the John Lewis group, hopes this will draw shoppers in. The initiative taps into the extraordinary resurgence of community and workplace choirs that has been led by choirmaster Gareth Malone. The supermarket will donate profits from the single to three UK charities . The champion of choral singing has inspired millions with TV series revealing how he has taught everyone from troubled schoolchildren to military wives to deliver magnificent performances. The Military Wives achieved the remarkable feat of having a Christmas number one in 2011 with the song Wherever You Are, which helped raise fund for Forces charities. The supermarket has written to choirs around the country and it will run an online campaign from Saturday (Oct 18) urging shoppers to form a virtual choir and sing the soundtrack for its Christmas advert. People are being asked to visit the Waitrose 'Donate Your Voice' website between Oct 18-28 to record and upload their own rendition of the Dolly Parton song. When members of the public donate their voice online, they will be also asked to put a virtual green token in a box to support one of the three charities involved, Age UK, Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity and The Trussell Trust, which supports food banks. Waitrose marketing director, Rupert Thomas: 'We really hope 'Donate Your Voice' will put the fun into fundraising for the festive season, especially with the growing popularity of people joining a choir. The charity single will be a cover of Dolly Parton's 'Try', a song originally released earlier this summer . 'Not only will we be able to create a totally unique soundtrack which has never been produced for advertising in this way before, but the public will be raising much needed funds for three fantastic causes.' Dolly Parton, who gave a stand-out performance at this year's Glastonbury Festival, released the song in the summer and she has used it as the theme for her own campaigning work on improving literacy. The programme, 'The Imagination Library', has so far seen her give away over 60 million books across the US, Canada, Australia and the UK. The song does not have a Christmas theme, however the lyrics talk about striving to overcome difficulties in life. Describing the song, she said: 'It's based on the fact a lot of my relatives couldn't read and write and I saw how crippling that was, but also the struggles I've gone through as an artist and in my life. 'It's about saying you've just gotta get out there and try. It's an uplifting encouraging song. You're not going to amount to anything unless you try.'","Have-a-go singers can 'donate' their voices online .

"With his ID in hand, the cherub-faced Matt Fitzpatrick will bid farewell to the amateur ranks at the 114th United States Open at Pinehurst this week and join the hard-nosed world of the professional game. No wonder they say looks can deceive. Standing next to the defending champion Justin Rose and the much-decorated Phil Mickelson on Thursday, it would be easy to think he is about to get eaten alive. But it’s less than two months since the Sheffield teenager finished in the top 25 at a PGA Tour event and that’s more than Tiger Woods managed at the same age. At the season’s first major, he sucked up a chastening double bogey at the first hole and missed out on the weekend at the Masters by a single stroke. Moving on up: Matt Fitzpatrick will compete as a professional at the US Open next week . All smiles: Fitzpatrick poses with his silver medal and Open champion Phil Mickelson at Muirfield last July . It was after those events that Fitzpatrick, 19, came to his life-changing decision. ‘At the Heritage tournament on Hilton Head Island I should have been at least six shots lower and that was down to experience,’ he said. ‘I know every player thinks they should score better but  everyone around me watching was thinking the same thing, that I really should have been a lot closer to the lead.’ Six shots lower and Fitzpatrick would have been joint second alongside Luke Donald. ‘That  experience and the Masters told me what many of the pros had been telling me — that I was ready to join them,’ he said. ‘Until then I wasn’t sure. But, without sounding big-headed, what’s left for me to achieve in the amateur world? My game is ready. I just need that experience.’ So to Pinehurst and Fitzpatrick knows the words that will greet him as he prepares to enter the locker room: ‘ID, please.’ It was that way at The Open at Muirfield last year when he won the silver medal for low amateur and has remained that way since. ‘I’ve just got used to showing my ID every time I turn up for a tournament,’ he says, smiling. ‘You watch Rory (McIlroy) head towards the locker room and the other players and they have that presence and get waved through without any questions asked. But I definitely don’t have that.’ He will acquire it quickly enough, of course, if all goes to plan following his professional debut at the Irish Open next week. Staying grounded: Fitzpatrick insists his the money and fame which comes with turning professional will not change him . Bright future: Fitzpatrick shows off the Havemeyer trophy after winning the 2013 US Amateur Championship . Not that his friends would ever allow him to get carried away. ‘They start yelling BBT (Becoming Big Time) if someone asks for an autograph,’ he said. ‘How would I cope with fame? I’d definitely stay grounded with the mates I’ve got, and my dad in particular. If you look at the likes of Adam Scott, who is probably the nicest golfer I’ve met at any level of the game and he’s the world No 1, it shows it can be done.’ Scott showed his class at Augusta when he walked from the first green to the second tee with  Fitzpatrick after that ugly six for openers.  ‘He was a big help and so were other players like G-Mac (Graeme McDowell) and Lee (Westwood),’ says Fitzpatrick. ‘I’m excited about what lies ahead. It’s my first proper job and it’s a massive step up from babysitting my brother and getting £20!’ Fitzpatrick need only look over at one of his playing partners at Pinehurst to know there are no guarantees. Rose, of course, went from finishing fourth at The Open as a 17-year-old amateur to missing 21 halfway cuts in a row. All change: Fitzpatrick's only previous job was as a babysitter for his younger brother . ‘I played a practice round with him at Augusta and we talked about that,’ said Fitzpatrick. ‘It just shows it’s a big jump from the amateur game and the standard is dauntingly high. So my goal is just to try to make the cut in each event I’m playing and take it from there.’ ‘If I wasn’t excited I should be thinking about another career. I want to play in majors and in front of big crowds. The Open last year and the Masters were fantastic experiences and I think I showed I can play.’ Making the cut and earning one final silver medal for low amateur would wrap up the first phase of his career nicely. Then it’s on to the real world, where Fitzpatrick is ready to grow up quickly. Even if he does look like he should still be babysitting.","Fitzpatrick will turn professional after the US Open .

"Arjen Robben was the star of the show and here is his heat map . Three days in to this World Cup and already the champions have a weaker grip on their trophy. Spain lost the first game four years ago, too, but defeat by Switzerland in South Africa cannot compare psychologically to these stunning events in north-east Brazil. Spain’s worst defeat since a 1963 reverse to Scotland, this was more than a setback. This was a humiliating, humbling capitulation, a defeat that asks as much about the mental fortitude of Vicente del Bosque’s team as it does their hapless defending. Some defeats in sport represent more than the loss of a solitary contest and this was one of them. This was a 7&6 in Ryder Cup singles, an Ashes defeat by an innings, a round one knockout in Vegas. Some teams would not recover from this. It remains to be seen if Spain can. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ecstatic Dutch fans flood out of the Emirates .

Ratings by JOE CALLAGHAN in Sao Paulo . Click here to view our brilliant World Cup Match Zone . Holland were brilliant. So hungry as to be ravenous and driven relentlessly forwards by the mesmeric talents of Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben. The upshot was one of the World Cup’s most startling results. We all remember Argentina’s loss to Cameroon in 1990, France succumbing to Senegal in Seoul 12 years later. In the very same way, we will remember this. Taken in isolation, the result was staggering enough. Spain 1 Holland 5. Say it slowly to make sure it’s real. What made this even more remarkable, though, was the way that it happened. Moments before half-time, Spain were a goal ahead and cruising. Had David Silva scored when played clear at this time the champions probably would have won. Fast forward an hour, though, and Spain were on their knees. In their eyes they had the shocked look of street mugging victims. Holland scored five and could have scored eight. Iker Casillas – who had a dreadful night – produced a stunning double save late on, while Wesley Sneijder fell over when it looked easier to score. 'In the end, it could have been six, seven or eight,' said Van Persie. 'But, really, it couldn’t be better.' Ultimately, the only thing that saved Spain was the full-time whistle. Back in the quiet of the dressing room, they will have looked at each other and seen faces they did not recognise staring back. The highlights reel will, of course, show them scoring first. Once again there was controversy about it but few will care now. Bunch of fives: Robben (left) slams home Holland's fifth goal in their stunning victory over Spain .

Net gain: Iker Casillas (right) is sent the wrong way as the ball goes into the goal . The best 11: Holland's Arjen Robben is arguably the player of the tournament so far . Pointing the finger: Nigel de Jong tells Fernando Torres to get up . Forward Diego Costa turned in the penalty area, placed his foot on a defender’s leg and was given a penalty. It was a poor decision but Xabi Alonso struck the kick to the right and Spain had a deserved lead. For a while, all was normal. Costa was struggling but it didn’t seem to matter. Xavi and Silva enjoyed a good 15 minutes and Spain looked likely to score again. Had they done so, Holland couldn’t have complained and Silva’s miss – trying to chip the goalkeeper – was certainly pivotal as within a minute or two the Dutch were level. Dutch left back Daley Blind’s pass from deep across field to Van Persie was certainly a good one. Spain failed to move out as one and the Manchester United forward was onside. Briefly he looked as though he may control the ball but ultimately he threw himself forwards and the header that arched above and beyond Casillas was as good as you will see. On terms at half-time, Holland would have taken a draw.  As it transpired they emerged to humiliate Spain. The Dutch simply can’t have had a better 45 minutes of football. The second goal, in the 53rd minute, started with Blind once again. This time his target was Robben and the manner in which the Bayern Munich star controlled the ball to turn back inside Gerard Pique and score was wonderful.

It was Spain’s heaviest defeat since Scotland beat them 6-2 in 1963. Portugal beat them 4-0 in 2010. Spain last conceded three in Brazil in the Confederations Cup final last June (lost 3-0 to Brazil (Fred 2, Neymar). They last conceded two to Group B rivals Chile in a friendly in September. They lost WC opener to Switzerland in 2010 (0-1, Gelson Fernandes). The Dutch have scored as many goals against the World Champions as they did in both their qualifying games against Andorra combined (5) As the rain fell hard, Spain sought answers. Del Bosque appeared briefly to urge them to lift their heads but they couldn’t. He made substitutions but they didn’t work. The direction of the game was set, the die cast. Goal three was a tough one. Casillas’ attempt to gather a corner was impeded by Van Persie but he simply needed to be stronger and as the ball disappeared over his head, Stefan de Vrij bundled it in on the goal line. Here on Friday night, Casillas looked like a goalkeeper in need. He looks not to have recovered from his poor showing in last month’s Champions League final and it will be interesting to see if Del Bosque drops him next week and, if so, who out of David de Gea or Pepe Reina comes in. 'I won’t blame individuals,' said Del Bosque. 'But we must improve. We cannot go under.' Certainly what happened in the 72nd minute wouldn’t have helped Casillas’ cause. Trying to control a simple back pass, the goalkeeper only managed to present the ball to Van Persie and goal No 4 was poked in to the empty goal as Holland took events from the surprising to the simply unforgettable.

Stop right there: Holland defender Bruno Martins Indi (left) grabs hold of Spain midfielder David Silva . Still there was time for a fifth. More mistakes from Spain, a gallop forward by Robben past Sergio Ramos and another devastating finish. On the Dutch bench, coach Louis van Gaal smiled and tried to look phlegmatic. 'We can get better, without a shadow of a doubt,' he said later. Del Bosque, meanwhile, placed a towel across his knee as the rain fell. He may well have placed it over his head.","Xabi Alonso gave Spain the lead from penalty spot in World Cup Group B .

"England captain Chris Robshaw has been challenged to raise his game to even greater heights on Saturday – to set the tone for a famous victory over the All Blacks. The 28-year-old Harlequins flanker delivered a superb individual performance last Saturday at Eden Park, emphatically out-playing his iconic opposite number, Richie McCaw, as the tourists dominated the first Test for long periods before subsiding to a 20-15 defeat. Yet, while Robshaw was a massive influence around the field, particularly with his ball-carrying and astute work as a link-man in attack, McCaw had a greater impact in terms of claiming turn-overs. Raise your game: Chris Robshaw has been challenged to perform even better in the second Test . Missing link: While Robshaw's ball-carrying was good, he was beaten at the breakdown by Richie McCaw . Poacher: The England skipper has a long way to go to match the All Blacks' leader in forcing turnovers . Given the crucial importance of breakdown poaching in a No 7’s repertoire, the England management have re-emphasised to their skipper the need to compete over the ball. Their demand for a greater ruck return is in keeping with the overall quest for a leap in standards this weekend, from an already impressive base. Asked to reflect on Robshaw’s exploits in Auckland and what was expected of him in the second Test, forwards coach Graham Rowntree said: ‘He was industrious last week. I thought he had a good game. We have been through his game and there are things he has to be better at, but he knows that. He will be the last one off the training field, doing his extras. ‘I’m delighted with how he is going but he knows he’s going to have to come up another level tomorrow. For Chris, that means finding another level in everything he does, but there are more breakdowns than anything else in the game and that is one area we coach daily.’ Wde role: Manu Tuilagi (centre) moves to the wing on Saturday as the back line in reshuffled . Straight back in: Owen Farrell takes his place at fy-half having joined the camp after the Premiership rugby final . Brothers in arms: The now full-strength England squad listens to Robshaw during the captain's run in Dunedin . On a high: Billy Twelvetrees has recovered from an ankle injury and will partner Luther Burrell in the centres . England have recalled Tom Wood at blindside flanker in place of James Haskell, who was arguably their most effective breakdown asset at Eden Park. But Wood and Robshaw – aided and abetted by the likes of lock pair Joe Launchbury and Geoff Parling – led a ferocious rucking onslaught 18 months which was at the heart of a record victory over New Zealand at Twickenham. That same raging intensity at the collision areas will be vital this time, if England are to disrupt the hosts’ possession and ensure their backs have quick ball to work with. That would allow them to set about dispelling the local perception that they want to play a slow, turgid game; a view which Rowntree took his turn to dismiss out of hand. Recalled: Tom Wood will play at blindside flanker in the only change to the starting forward pack . On a high: Wood comes in for James Haskell after captaining Northampton to victory over Saracens . Firepower: Stuart Lancaster will call on the likes of Courtney Lawes from the bench at Forsyth Barr Stadium . Perfect conditions: England and the All Blacks will go into battle under the roof at the Highlanders' home ground . ‘We want to play quick,’ said the former prop. ‘I was alarmed by some of the comments in the press this week saying we want to slow the game down. We want to play quick because we have a lightning-fast backline and a dynamic group of forwards, and that stadium will suit us. ‘In my opinion, the squad is a lot fitter – and I’m sure the data would back that up as well – than it ever has been. That is certainly helping the way we want to play. We want to play a challenging game and we want every tool available for a driving game or a quick game. We want everything.’ There was a degree of doubt about whether or not Forsyth Barr Stadium – with its roof-covered surface – would suit England’s kickers, after Jonny Wilkinson had some trouble shooting at goal there during the last World Cup. But the indications from training there this morning are that Owen Farrell and Freddie Burns endured no such problems. Kicking game: Owen Farrell will be playing under a roof in the second Test . Waiting game: Saints hooker Dylan Hartley will be back-up for Rob Webber, who impressed in the first Test to keep his starting spot . Quick recovery: Scrum-half Danny Care starts after missing the first Test with a shoulder injury . Warming up: England ease into their session in the stadium nicknamed the Glasshouse . Warming up: England ease into their session in the stadium nicknamed the Glasshouse . Testing time: While Mike Brown (left) is rock solid under the high ball, Tuilagi (right) will be peppered on the wing . ‘Owen’s not missed a shot this morning,’ said Rowntree. ‘I was marvelling at how easy he makes it. Crikey, I’m glad I never had to do that for a living, under that pressure, but they both (Farrell and Burns) kicked well this morning.’ England have stocked their bench with high-calibre, heavyweight replacements, in the hope of blasting to victory in the final quarter against a tiring All Blacks defence. There will be a major onus on the visitors to maintain their intensity levels for the entire match, which they were unable to do last weekend. ‘You have to be able to play until the last 10 seconds,’ said Rowntree. ‘New Zealand have shown that, particularly in their victory in Ireland last autumn. We have to be pounding away at the end there. That's something we are constantly speaking about; being there and accurate in the last few seconds of the game. It's certainly a work-on for us.’ So near, yet so far: Robshaw saw England concede a late try against New Zealand in the first Test .

"New dad Craig Mahon capped the most unforgettable week of his life by scoring the goal that earned Conference side Chester a shock 2-1 win at League Two high-fliers Southend. Mahon, whose partner had given birth to twins on Friday, provided a moment of Cup magic with the winner at Roots Hall. The Chester winger rifled a low 25-yard shot in the 51st minute past home keeper Daniel Bentley to book the Blues their place in the second round draw tomorrow. Stefan Payne celebrates scoring Dover's winner against Morecambe in the first round of the FA Cup . Delighted Chester boss Steve Burr, who has previously guided Northwich and Kidderminster to the third round, said: ‘I said to the lads they could be heroes.’ Dover, also from the Conference, also beat League Two opponents, pipping Morecambe 1-0 at The Crabble. Former Fulham youngster Stefan Payne’s fifth goal of the season separated the sides. But Dover boss Chris Kinnear was not surprised. He said: ‘There’s not much of a gap between our division and League Two and this place is a fortress.’ Southport, another Conference outfit, will also be optimistic of springing a replay surprise after their 0-0 draw at Dagenham. Dartford advanced into the second round for the first time in 30 years after winning a thriller 4-3 at neighbours Bromley. Bromley, of the Conference South, had twice come from behind to draw level but Tom Bradbrook followed his brother Elliot on to the scoresheet with an 81st-minute winner. Ben Strevens was Eastleigh’s hero as The Spitfires moved into the second round for the first time with a 2-1 win against Conference rivals Lincoln. Bury's Nathan Cameron (right) celebrates scoring  against Hemel Hempstead in the first round of the FA Cup . Hemel Hempstead of the Conference South were dreaming of bridging a 61-step gulf in the pyramid when they took a 10th-minute lead at Bury through James Potton. But Bury hit back to win 3-1 though impressed boss David Flitcroft said: ‘I thought they were inspirational. A credit to themselves and their manager.’ Barnet’s hopes of a shock against Wycombe were undone when midfielder Sam Togwell, who was on loan at Wycombe last season, was sent off in the first half. Aaron Pierre and Sam Wood went on to score for Wycombe who came from behind to win 3-1, while Barnet finished the game with nine men after Andy Yiadom was also dismissed. Tranmere must have feared they would be on the wrong end of an upset when George Donnelly was sent off at home to Bristol Rovers, but Micky Adams’ men held on for a 1-0 victory. Basingstoke boss Jason Bristow says his side can go to AFC Telford and win after fighting back to claim a 1-1 draw at home. A general view of Gigg Lane as Bury take on Hemel Hemsptead in the first round of the FA Cup . Chris Flood earned the Conference South outfit a replay five minutes into the second half after Rod McDonald’s free-kick had put the Conference’s bottom side ahead in the 18th minute. Bristow said: ‘There is a lot of belief in the side and good characters and the only disappointment is that we didn’t win but we will be in a confident mood heading into the replay.’ Byron Harrison scored a hat-trick as League Two side Cheltenham thrashed 10-man Swindon 5-0. It was the third season running that Leag ue One Swindon have lost to lower-League opposition, though they were fuming over the dismissal of Nathan Thompson which turned the tie. Swindon were trailing to Harrison’s opener when Thompson was sent off for the third time this season for what referee Carl Boyeson decided was a professional foul on Terry Gornell. ‘It was comical and I thought it was a joke at first when I saw the red card come out,’ said Swindon boss Mark Cooper. ‘For me it wasn’t even a foul.’ Gornell then added a second before Harrison struck twice more, either side of a 20-yarder from Matt Richards, to send Cheltenham into round two. East Thurrock travelled north to Hartlepool in style — the Essex minnows were loaned the use of the West Ham team bus for the day — but their Cup run is over courtesy of a 2-0 defeat. A Jonathan Franks double ensured a first win for new Hartlepool manager Paul Murray. ‘We have played five or six games to get here and it is a great achievement for the club,’ said proud Thurrock boss John Coventry. Conference North side Fylde’s long trip south to Plymouth also failed to produce a fairytale ending as they lost 2-0. A late substitution proved costly for League One side Fleetwood as they crashed 1-0 at their League Two hosts Cambridge. Fleetwood boss Graham Alexander’s decision to bring on Jamie Proctor backfired as he was sent off 11 minutes later for violent conduct. Kwesi Appiah punished them by scoring Cambridge’s winner.","Conference side Dover beat Morecambe 1-0 in the first round of the FA Cup .

"With her perfectly tousled blonde hair, demure smile and outgoing personality, Lady Kitty Spencer bears more than a passing resemblance to her late aunt, Princess Diana. And last night Earl Spencer's daughter  followed in her relative's charitable footsteps by supporting a high-profile event in London in aid of servicemen. Dressed in an eye-catching floor-length red gown, Lady Kitty arrived at the Corinthia Hotel London for the Give Us Time Gala with her mother, Victoria Aitken. Glamorous: Lady Kitty Spencer, niece of Diana Princess of Wales and cousin of Prince William and Prince Harry, arrived at the Corinthia Hotel London for the Give Us Time Gala last night in a dazzling red evening gown . Give Us Time is a small charity founded by Dr Liam Fox MP that takes one-week holidays donated by owners of holiday homes and timeshares and matches them with British soldiers in need of rest rehabilitation and reconnection with their families. Lady Kitty, who works for the charity, made a speech to guests including Chancellor George Osborne. The charity launched in 2012 with the help of a close-knit team of volunteers. A few months later, Kitty met one of them through a mutual friend. She offered to help out doing administrative tasks and liaising with families and it wasn’t long before everybody recognised the profile-raising potential of having her on board. Still looking glamorous: Her mother Victoria Aitken, nee Lockwood, joined her on crutches at the Give Us Time event, which is a small charity founded by Dr Liam Fox MP that takes one-week holidays donated by owners of holiday homes and timeshares and matches them with British soldiers in need of rest rehabilitation and reconnection with their families . Charitable: Lady Kitty, who works for the charity, made a speech to guests including Chancellor George Osborne . Helping hand: The 23-year-old helped her mother hobble into the event on crutches . Kitty’s role with the charity, for which she takes no salary, involves marketing and matching service personnel with suitable holiday homes. Much of the work is done via email and over the phone, but she also meets soldiers at fundraising events . She was joined by her mother, Victoria Aitken, née Lockwood, who was a fashion model and the first wife of Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer, the younger brother of Diana. Victoria, who  married ex-model Jonathan Aitken in 2005 and divorced him in 2009, appeared to have broken her leg and was using crutches. Kitty was styled for last night's event by Micheljohn's Nariman Pouranpir (Anna Wintour's make-up artists) and her hair was coiffed to perfection by Jay Rapata. Kitty, the 23-year-old who boasts a lineage dating from pre-Tudor times and a family fortune of more than £100million, was named the most eligible girl in Britain by Tatler magazine in 2007. Kitty grew up away from the media spotlight in South Africa with her mother. She also attended William and Kate's wedding in 2011 but her parents have deliberately tried to keep her out of the media spotlight. Famed guests: Kitty's role with the charity, for which she takes no salary, involves marketing and matching service personnel with suitable holiday homes. George Osborne showed his support at the event last night . Support: Her mother, Victoria Aitken, née Lockwood, who was model and the first wife of Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer, the younger brother of Diana, joined her, left, as did George Osborne . Rarely seen out on the party scene, Kitty was a straight-A student at Reddam House, a private school for South Africa's elite.

"Still the shock waves from Salvador are shimmering through this World Cup. Holland 5, Spain 1: no matter how many times you read the statistic, it never makes a scrap of sense. The finest team the modern game has seen were systematically dismantled by a Holland side whose best days had seemed behind them. ‘The end of an era’ was the instant critical reaction. A cliche, certainly, yet it may well be true. VIDEO Scroll down for Spain striker Diego Costa demands all in or nothing . End of an era? Spain's period of dominance has been questioned following Friday's 5-1 loss to Holland . Football teams are like fighters; the more savage the beating, the more likely are they to lose their appetite for the fray. And beatings rarely come more savage than that which the Dutch handed out in the Arena Fonte Nova. The search for scapegoats began with the final whistle. England followers will readily recognise the process. The manager, Vicente del Bosque, has to go; immediately if not sooner. True, his team had lost just eight of 85 matches before Friday but that will not save him. And he can take with him his hapless goalkeeper Iker Casillas, the ancient midfielders Xavi and Andres Iniesta and the entire back four. As for Fernando Torres, how did he get here anyway? Time to go? Vicente del Bosque has only lost just nine of 86 matches as Spain coach . Carnage reigns. It appears that King Juan Carlos had a feeling that something like this might happen, which is why he abdicated the other day. Had he opted to hang around, he would surely have become another casualty. But before axes flash and blood is spilled, we might remember just what Spain have meant to the game. Between 2008-2012, they became champions of Europe, world champions and European champions once again, when they scored four unanswered goals against Italy in one of the most accomplished performances a major final has ever produced. Yet recitation of the bald facts cannot convey the poise, the daring, the imagination, the sheer beauty of this extraordinary football team. When they were at their best they expanded our notions of how the game might be played. They were wonderfully audacious. Running riot: Holland forward Arjen Robben (left) scored twice in their Group B drubbing of Spain on Friday . They took chances and accepted the consequences when their plans proved unfruitful. They knew that the game is infinitely better than bloodless pragmatists would have us believe and they clung to their expansive creed. They never could understand the English obsession with physical contact. Xabi Alonso, once of Liverpool and now of Real Madrid, expressed his feelings succinctly: ‘I just don’t understand football in those terms. Tackling is a last resort and you will need it, but it isn’t a quality to aspire to. It’s more important to construct a good team, to know how you are going to play, how to read the match. You have to truly understand the game. Past it? Spain captain Iker Casillas' place in the team is under review after conceding five vs Holland . ‘From a Spanish perspective, what matters is the ball; possession of it, knowing what to do with it and when. Technique is vital and intelligence is fundamental.’ There are tactical minds in England who will suggest that Alonso might have flung a tackle or two at Holland in Salvador. Why, there are pundits in Spain who are probably calling for his head at this very moment. But his argument is a lucid exposition of a philosophy which brought his country so many prizes and so many more admirers. False hope: Xabi Alonso put Spain ahead with a first-half penalty against Holland at Arena Fonte Nova . Of course, the Dutch can boast a similarly excellent tradition of producing thinking footballers. Certainly this World Cup will be enhanced by their extended presence. Yet the thoughts of many will be with the team that imploded so dramatically on Friday. They lost their opening World Cup match last time, before twinkling through to the trophy, but that was quite different; a defeat rather than a disaster. Best: Spain are the defending World Cup champions (pictured) and double European Championship holders . If they discover even a smidgeon of their old form, they can surely qualify second in their group. But they must be feeling like the golfer who shoots 90 in the first round of an Open; his task is not impossible but nobody is backing his chances. For this generation of Spanish footballers, it may never be a glad, confident morning again. If so, there must be consolation in the memories. For they endowed their sport with grace and style and, that inescapable word, beauty. They did the game some service and for that we should all be thankful.","Spain lost 5-1 to Holland in their Group B World Cup opener on Friday .

"Italy's Daniele De Rossi has a leg injury and is highly unlikely to play in the World Cup Group D showdown against Uruguay on Tuesday, the Azzurri's team doctor said on Saturday. The 30-year-old midfielder played the full 90 minutes in both of Italy's games in the tournament, a 2-1 victory over England and a 1-0 loss to Costa Rica. 'He has a muscle problem in his leg,' Enrico Castellacci told a news conference on Saturday. 'It is highly unlikely that he will be able to play on Tuesday. VIDEO Scroll down for Is Daniele De Rossi an injury concern for Italy? Doubt: Daniele De Rossi is likely to miss Tuesday's game with Uruguay because of a leg injury . 'If I was being positive I would say that it is possible the injury to the muscle would improve but it is highly improbable he will play.' De Rossi is likely to replaced by Brazilian-born Thiago Motta alongside the influential Andrea Pirlo in midfield. A point against Uruguay would send the Italians through to the knockout stage with Costa Rica. Castellacci said De Rossi would probably need a week to 10 days to recover completely, making him also a doubt for Italy's potential last-16 clash, should they get the result they need on Tuesday. Brink: Italy were beaten 1-0 by Costa Rica and another defeat would send them home . Central defender Andrea Barzagli, who was an injury doubt before the England and Costa Rica matches because of a long-term tendonitis problem, is recuperating well and will be up to playing a third match in 10 days, Castellacci said. There was also good news about fullback Mattia De Scoglio, who missed the first two games of the tournament with a calf strain but is back in training and will be available. There had been a couple of minor knocks for other members of the squad in the Costa Rica match, Castellacci said, but none that would prevent anybody from playing. Tuesday's match is again an early kick-off with the Italians taking on Uruguay in the full heat of the day as they did in the match against Costa Rica. Castellacci said the heat had caused the Italians problems in Recife but at least the Uruguayans would be equally unaccustomed to it. 'For the Costa Ricans, the temperature was routine but for us it was tough,' he said. 'The players felt it. Against Uruguay, it will impact both sides in the same way.'","Roma midfielder struggling to be fit for Tuesday's game which will determine Italy's World Cup fate .

"A teacher who has not taught any pupils for 14 years despite being on full pay is disrupting the education of thousands of children after her suspension provoked a series of strikes. National Union of Teachers official Julie Davies, 58 – who describes herself bizarrely as a ‘psycho killer’ on social media, was suspended after head teachers accused her of ‘confrontation’, ‘obfuscation’ and encouraging ‘a climate of mistrust’. In return, she launched a legal case claiming council bosses had no right to suspend her because her employment had wrongly been transferred from a school to the local authority. After that failed, the NUT branch where she is secretary responded with walkouts at two schools, disrupting classes for around 3,000 pupils, with further strikes planned. One out, all out: NUT official Julie Davies, pictured centre, with teachers who walked out over her suspension . The news comes in a week when Communities Secretary Eric Pickles attacked taxpayer funding for union officials, insisting they should be paid for by union fees. Mrs Davies, whose Twitter account describes her as a ‘teacher, union rep, psycho killer, obviously’, has not stood in front of a class since 2000, despite continuing to earn £35,000-plus a year as an English teacher. She was released from teaching English at Northumberland Park community school in North London to carry out ‘staff representation’ full time, while still picking up her annual pay from the public purse. She has been paid almost £500,000 despite not doing any teaching. One parent said: ‘It is completely unacceptable. We are paying this woman to disrupt our children’s schooling and the lives of their hard-working parents. On Twitter, Mrs Davies describes herself as a 'teacher, union rep, Psychokiller, obviously' ‘She is using these strikes to pursue her own personal agenda, having been outed by head teachers for the disruptive influence that she is.’ The High Court last month threw out her claim that Haringey Council in North London did not have the power to suspend her. It heard Mrs Davies was employed as a teacher in 1992. She was elected deputy divisional secretary of the NUT for Haringey in 1997 and released from her teaching duties three days a week for union work. Her request to be released from her duties full time was granted in 2000, and she has been elected branch secretary every year since. In July this year, however, the council suspended her as it investigated letters received from local primary and secondary head teachers refusing to fund her union work. Mrs Davies was released from teaching English at Northumberland Park community school in North London, pictured, to carry out ‘staff representation’ full time, while still picking up her annual pay . One from secondary heads said: ‘Ms Davies’ preferred approach is one of confrontation and obfuscation. She seeks to encourage a climate of mistrust, often involving the airing of her personal critiques of head teachers, rather than seeking to develop effective communication or relationships based on trust and openness.’ After her court action failed, her NUT branch organised strikes at Highgate Wood and Fortismere schools in North London, where nearly all lessons were cancelled on Thursday. More walkouts are planned at the schools on Wednesday and Thursday next week. JulieDavies.org.uk, a website supporting the union rep, claims Haringey has ‘behaved disgracefully’, adding: ‘Julie’s suspension is not related to any real disciplinary offences but is actually a device to discredit her and force her out of her job.’ Mrs Davies, who lives in a £500,000 house with her husband David, 65, has previously insisted: ‘I work really hard. My substantive position is English teacher. If I stopped doing this I could return tomorrow.’ Last night, she told the Mail she was forbidden from talking to the Press. Haringey also declined to comment during her disciplinary procedure.","Julie Davies was suspended after teachers accused her of 'confrontation'

"Gary Cahill will be taking Italy’s winner in Saturday’s World Cup opener personally. When you’re a top defender, that is how you feel. To be fair to the Chelsea defender, he was taken out of the game by Antonio Candreva’s pinpoint cross. The ball was played into the most difficult area for Cahill to deal with it — the back post. If Candreva had played the ball anywhere else in the penalty area, Cahill would have dealt with it. VIDEO Scroll down to brush up on your Portuguese with Gary Cahill . Disappointed: Gary Cahill sits dejected at the final whistle as England were beaten 2-1 by Italy in the World Cup opener . Beaten: Cahill allowed Mario Balotelli to out-jump him for Italy's winner early in the second half . Anticipation: Cahill was a fraction too late in reading Antonio Candreva's cross from the right, allowing the Milan striker to get the better of him . Floored: Balotelli runs off to celebrate as Cahill ends up with his face in the dirt . Unfortunately, Cahill got caught under the ball and Mario Balotelli scored with an easy header. As a defender, I know how hard it is to deal with that sort of ball, but by the same token you have to find a way of stopping crosses like Candreva’s. In international football, particularly as a defender, you have to be in a state of total concentration. One lapse, just for a split-second, can cost you. In the lead-up to Italy’s winner Balotelli was pulling off Cahill’s shoulder, sensing where his team-mate was going to put the ball. As a defender, you need to sense that run really early and get the necessary steps in to ensure you are in the best position to deal with the cross. If you don’t, you are left just flinging yourself in the air because the striker can see you, but you can’t see him and you are just hoping you can get yourself in the way. If you sense the danger early, you will be better prepared to drop off quicker and get those important steps in to help you deal with the situation. Committed: Cahill slides in on Balotelli during the match in Manaus . Shield: Cahill sweeps the ball away from Italian substitute striker Ciro Immobile . It is important to stress that Cahill is playing in a World Cup against the planet’s most dangerous strikers. Even if you do drop off and get yourself into a good position, moments like Balotelli’s goal can happen. Cahill and England’s defence must now forget about the Italy game and focus on Uruguay — and possibly Luis Suarez  — on Thursday. We all know Suarez is a match-winner, as is Edinson Cavani, and Diego Forlan can be. Defensively,  Uruguay didn’t look particularly good against Costa Rica on Saturday, so England certainly have enough going forward to come away with the result needed. Next up: Cahill faces the challenge of containing Uruguay's Edinson Cavani on Thursday . But what is important is that England are harder to break down. It could help if Steven Gerrard plays in a deeper role. He played that deep-lying central midfield role for Liverpool last season and it could help England get the result they need. England’s centre-halves will need all the help they can get against  Uruguay, and Gerrard can be the one to provide that protection — particularly if Suarez plays.","England defender allowed Mario Balotelli to get above him for Italy's winner .

"A 13-year-old girl has been arrested over claims she 'drop-kicked' and punched a three-year-old boy in the toilets of a Nando's restaurant. Mother Jade Scott, 25, said she has been left 'absolutely devastated' by the alleged attack on her young son, Ralph Cavalli, which occurred in the Rushey Green restaurant in Catford, south east London. She claims the youngster went to the toilet with his older sister Lily but returned crying and 'with marks on his face' after being attacked by the unnamed teenager. Jade Scott, 25, said she has been left 'absolutely devastated' by the alleged attack on her young son, Ralph Cavalli (together above), which occurred in the Rushey Green Nando's restaurant in Catford, south east London . She said she asked her two children what had happened and was told by the youngsters that Ralph was 'drop-kicked' – a wrestling move which sees one fighter leap off the floor and kick the other in the chest with both feet. The children also reported that the youngster was punched in the face by the teenage girl. Ms Scott, of Rushey Green, Catford, said she reported the incident to police and the girl was arrested. She has since been released on police bail until December pending further enquiries. Ms Scott said: 'I just could not believe it. 'I was so angry at first, then I began to cry because I just couldn't understand why someone would do that to my little boy. 'It made me feel degraded to be honest and that I failed him as a mum and let someone violently abuse him. I'm absolutely devastated.'

"The Prime Minister says rural voters opposed to new planning rules are killing off the dream of home ownership . Rural voters opposed to new planning rules are killing off the chances of young people achieving the ‘dream of home ownership’, insists David Cameron. The Prime Minister accused grassroots Conservatives and countryside groups that oppose building on greenfield land of putting their own interests before the country’s. Echoing Sir John Major’s calls for the Coalition to do more to boost social mobility, Mr Cameron insisted the plans should be viewed ‘in the round’ because more houses have to be built. Asked what he would say to Conservatives in the countryside who claim they cannot vote Tory because of the Government’s liberalisation of planning rules, Mr Cameron insisted he would not give ground. He said: ‘Planning reform is important. It’s important that we build more houses because the average age of the first-time buyer has crept into the 30s, and I believe in a socially mobile society where people can achieve their dream of home ownership.’ However, campaigners say local people are now unable to block new building on greenfield land – undeveloped areas of agricultural or forest land – after the Coalition introduced an assumption in favour of ‘sustainable development’, which moved away from the notion that developers had to first look for brownfield sites – areas that had been previously developed. Mr Cameron spoke out as a report published by 41 environmental organisations, including the Campaign to Protect Rural England and RSPB, found that the Government is failing to deliver nearly a third of its natural environment commitments, including protection of the green belt, farm animal welfare and reversing the decline in wildlife. Alongside the report, the organisations published a poll of more than 2,000 people which found that 83 per cent believe the natural environment should be protected at all costs. Shaun Spiers, chief executive of the CPRE, said: ‘We need to build many more houses, including affordable homes in villages and market towns, but all that the Government’s planning reforms are delivering is more strife. The only difference planning liberalisation has made is that houses that would have been built in towns and cities, aiding urban regeneration, are now sprawling into the countryside instead. ‘David Cameron needs to take off his rose-tinted spectacles and see what is really happening to it – not local choice and discretion but far too many poor-quality developments plonked down on green fields in the teeth of opposition from local people.’ Campaigners say local people are now unable to block new building on greenfield land after the Coalition introduced an assumption in favour of 'sustainable development' Demand: David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg have both said Britain must build new homes . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, whose Sheffield Hallam seat borders the Peak District National Park, admitted that discontent over planning reforms ‘is a very sensitive issue’. He added: ‘We have to build more homes but we mustn’t throw the baby out with the bath water as far as the green belt is concerned.’ But Mr Clegg insisted ministers needed to act because while not enough homes are being built, local opposition means developers often cannot work on sites despite planning permission being granted. He said: ‘It needs to be more efficient, where developers are not held up year after year when we need people employed on building sites [and] we need more homes built across the country. ‘We have a problem, which is that we have built far too few new homes for far too long.’","Echoes Sir John Major's calls for Coalition to do more for social mobility .

"A 58-year-old teacher  was found with 5,000 photos of teenage boys at his school, in a cache of 60,000 indecent images of other children stored on his computer. Timothy Arthur, who claims he has never had a sexual relationship, was caught as part of an international investigation into the sale of child abuse materials by a Canadian company. As well as 86 extreme images of children being raped, tortured or abused with animals, he had a further 59,477 indecent images and two movies. Timothy Arthur claims he did not know the images he had stored of teenage boys at his school were illegal . Timothy Arthur, 58, was found with 5,000 images he had taken of teenage boys at the Grange School, Bristol . Among these were 5,000 photos of boys aged 14 to 16 at the Grange School in Warmley, Bristol, where he worked part time. Bristol Crown Court heard all the schoolboys he photographed were clothed and had been aware of the pictures being taken by him. Arthur admitted 11 counts of making indecent images of children but escaped prison with a suspended sentence. The court heard that during the investigation into the sale of child abuse material Arthur was identified as a customer of the firm by police in Toronto who handed his details to the UK National Crime Agency via Interpol. Arthur bought DVDs, CDs and downloads between December 2007 and December 2010 with over 70 containing indecent images of children. David Scutt, defending Arthur, said the teacher accepted he had an 'unhealthy obsession' with the material and claimed he had bought it without realising it was illegal. Timothy Arthur hoarded 5,000 photos of teenage boys alongside 60,000 indecent images of other children . Arthur had the images of the boys in a file of 60,000 indecent images of children - some of them being raped . He said: 'He is a 58-year-old man. He has never had a sexual relationship. He is particularly naive.' Mr Scutt added that Arthur had been working only part time at the school and resigned as soon as he was arrested in February. Recorder David Bartlett said some of the images would not on their own be classed as indecent but he could not ignore the higher level images and the sheer number involved. He said: 'If you take the unhealthy obsession with this material then it shows that the relatively innocent stuff can't have been obtained innocently.' Arthur, of Bristol, was given a one-year suspended jail sentence for his crimes, which are thought to have spanned over a three year period. He was also given a 24-month community order, supervision and a 15-year Sexual Offences Prevention Order banning him from working with children.","Timothy Arthur was found with 5,000 pictures of boys at the Grange School .

"Christian Benteke is likely to avoid a club fine for his red card against Tottenham after Aston Villa failed in a bid to reduce his three-game ban. Villa’s Belgian striker was sent off for retaliation against Ryan Mason of Spurs on Sunday and manager Paul Lambert admits he will be speaking to the player about the incident. But the Villa boss remains adamant that the punishment does not fit the crime, even though the FA disagreed. Christian Benteke raises his hand towards the face of Tottenham midfielder Ryan Mason . Benteke was sent off by referee Neil Swarbrick during Tottenham's 2-1 win against Aston Villa . Lambert said: ‘I haven’t really had a chat with him about it as there was so much going on but I will speak to him. If I really thought it was a right hook then... but the provoking was definitely there. ‘It’s unfair to say whether I will fine him until I speak to him but it’s very unlikely. I said after the game that I don’t condone what he did but I can understand why he did it. That incident, he got hit twice with it. ‘I think he will learn from it, that you can’t put your hands in anybody’s face. He’s been disappointed. We asked the FA to look at it and it was dismissed. ‘We thought three games was excessive. It was commentated on the television that if Christian has to go then there were other things. We weren’t contesting the sending off but the three games. They (the FA) threw it out.’ Benteke gets involved in a melee near the dugout as players from both Villa and Spurs get involved . Benteke walks down the tunnel at Villa Park after being shown his marching orders for a petulant incident . Villa boss Paul Lambert remains adamant that Benteke's punishment is 'excessive' Benteke has just returned to the side after recovering from a ruptured Achilles heel. He was called up for the Belgian national squad on Thursday and Lambert is delighted his player will be getting more game time. ‘It’s good he’s picked for the national team to keep up his level of fitness,’ added Lambert.

"The World Cup is rapidly becoming a celebration of South and Central America. Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica and Mexico are all exceeding expectations and exciting the world with their style of play. Argentina are comfortably placed and after Thursday even Uruguay have a performance of which they can be proud. But one nation from the region stands apart, unimpressive and uninspiring —and that is the most important one of all: Brazil. The hosts, synonymous with the idea that football should be joyful, stand apart from the Carnival at present after two quite drab displays. VIDEO Scroll down for 'Neymar: I hope to fulfill the dreams of all Brazilians' Shooting practice: Neymar aims for goal as team-mate Dani Alves watches on during training on Saturday . All smiles: Neymar and Dani Alves (left) were relaxed during training as they geared up to face Cameroon . Show of strength: Neymar holds off team-mate Fernandinho during Brazil training . The laboured performance against Croatia, where a contentious penalty helped them nudge ahead, and the scoreless draw with Mexico, albeit after heroics from Mexican keeper Guillermo Ochoa, has many Brazilians worrying if their team will rise to challenge of hosting the tournament and win a sixth World Cup. The pressure is immense. Brazilians regard World Cup wins as a birth-right and hosting the tournament has intensified that expectation, especially amid social unrest and protest, when many look to the team to be a unifying force for the nation. There is a very real fear among the authorities that an early exit will cause the daily protests against the cost and corruption of this tournament to escalate into a mass movement. So this side carries an even heavier load than most Brazil teams. And it is clear much of the burden is falling upon 22-year-old Neymar. Going down: Fred wins a controversial penalty against Croatia after slight contact from Dejan Lovren . Spot on: Neymar scores a penalty against Croatia to put Brazil 2-1 ahead on June 12 . No chance: Croatia keeper Stipe Pletikosa is helpless to stop Neymar scoring from the penalty spot . Tostao, a member of the great 1970 Brazil side and now a respected newspaper commentator, wrote: ‘The major problem is the team’s reliance on Neymar. If he plays well, then they are ok; if not, it’s a disaster. After the first match, I though Brazil would be better against Mexico but it was as though they were letting the game pass them by, waiting for good luck.’ Emerson Leao, the goalkeeper from the 1974 and 1978 World Cup teams who captained his country and is now a renowned manager, has been a prominent critic. ‘The national team have been shocking,’ he said. ‘Against Mexico they started too slowly, as they had done against Croatia, and they didn’t get the luck. Nobody did anything special: the defenders were lost; Oscar and Ramires were lost in midfield; and Neymar was lost. I don’t know what was happening. Inspired: Mexico keeper Guillermo Ochoa saves from Thiago Silva to deny Brazil victory last week . At full stretch: Guillermo Ochoa dives to make a save during Mexico's 0-0 draw with Brazil in Fortaleza . ‘Against Cameroon on Monday all the players need to be pressing more and better focused. Neymar is a very good player but he is not alone on the pitch. All the players have to support him. In my opinion, at this moment the national team is not a united group.’ A feature of their games has been the stirring renditions of the national anthem, which has reduced some players, including Neymar, to tears. Zico, a Brazilian great from the 1982 side who also played in the 1978 and 1986 World Cups, said: . ‘All the players have to take care during the national anthem, because they need to have focus on the match. In the first game, I understood because the World Cup was here and the game meant a lot to Brazilian people. Breaking down: Neymar was reduced to tears during Brazil's national anthem before the Mexico game . Work to do: Luis Felipe Scolari and his Brazil players have yet to live up to expectations . 'But they need to control themselves.  I don’t understand why the players were crying against Mexico. Those kind of feelings can mean that you lose focus on the other team. If they want to become champions, they will need to concentrate on football.’ The question is what can Luiz Felipe Scolari, the former Chelsea manager and 2002 World Cup winner, do about the sluggish start? The attacking options of Fred, Hulk and Jo, who had inglorious spells at Manchester City and Everton, are hardly inspiring. Chelsea’s Willian is yet to start, which is surprising. Scolari is an old hand, having overseen the 2002 Brazilian triumph and taken Portugal to the Euro 2004 final and 2006 World Cup semi-final. But criticism will be intense if the display against Cameroon is again mediocre. Stunned: Brazil fans react after Marcelo's own goal gave Croatia a 1-0 lead on June 12 . Zico said: ‘I don’t know why Scolari starts with Ramires on the right. Mexico played like champions and had perfect tactics to stop midfielders. And Brazil did not react, maybe because they only played smaller teams during the preparations.’ Tostao said: ‘Against Mexico, Scolari had better options like Willian,  Hernanes or Fernandinho, to try to get closer to Neymar, but he chose Bernard. It’s clear the national team depends a lot on the talent of Neymar, talent to create any offensive play. ‘In the last game, Paulinho, Oscar, Fred, Ramires and Bernard did not have a good time. Jo moved a lot. Dani Alves was slow and Thiago Silva, David Luiz, Luiz Gustavo, Marcelo and Neymar, played well, but some way from their best. They need to show more beauty in their play, to play like champions.’ Brazil are a long way from that. The next few weeks could be very difficult if they cannot fulfil expectations.","Brazil's performances against Croatia and Mexico have been uninspiring .

"How do you make a newborn baby even more adorable? Dress him/her as an angel, cupid or a superbaby of course. Photographer Neil Prahova has created a stunning range of portraits of infants in elaborate fancy dress. The 34-year-old places her tiny subjects in the middle of fantastical scenes depicting Mexican deserts, starry skies and sparkling seas. Olé: Neil Prahova captures images of newborns positioned in colourful scenes . Neil originally came to live in London after moving from Moscow in 1998 when she took up photography. Each of the photographs require the babies to lie incredibly still in order for them to blend into their backgrounds. To avoid any unwanted wriggling Neil photographs the tots when they are three to ten days old which is the time when they tend to sleep the most and therefore move the least. It also means that their limbs can be easily be positioned in the complicated poses while maintaining the comfort of the sleeping baby. When Neil originally started taking her photographs she says the scale was a lot smaller with less ambitious props. Bobbing along: Neil takes her pictures when the babies are between 3-10 days old when they are at their most sleepy . Petite Prince: By photographing them at such a young age Neil is able to pose the baby's limbs more easily . Creative crab: It was after having her own children that Neil decided to get more inventive with her photographs . 'I commissioned a lady who does professional knitting to knit a lot of baby hats, blankets and I also bought various other accessories, so now I have a whole collection for newborn and baby photography shoots.' Neil, who describes herself as a mumtrepreneaur and is a mother herself meaning that she is incredibly engaged in her work . 'Babies are so unbelievably cute especially in those first days after being born' says Neil. She says it was when she finally had her own children that she began attempted far more inventive photographs. 'When I became a mother myself three years ago, I could feel my creative desires changing, urging me to use my new skills as a parent to create wonderful images that other new parents would treasure forever. Hanging around: Despite the serene appearance of her images Neil says that babies can be very uncooperative . Little angel: Many of Neil's photographs picture babies who have nodded off to sleep . Super baby! Neil first began photographing babies when she moved to London in 1998 . 'There is something magical about capturing an image, a small piece of reality, and turning it into an artifact of that moment in time.' Despite the serene look of the images the photographer says that creating the images isn't always a peaceful process. 'In order to make the photo good enough to honour that moment in time, some knowledge and practice is needed, and a lot of patience. 'The more you learn, the more you practice, the more natural it becomes. There's always something more to learn. Sweet dreams: The sets for the images are created using fabrics and often a fleece background . Little cherub: Neil combines her experience as a photographer with her experience as a mother to create the perfect photograph . Flying high: Neil says that her photographs are a great way of capturing a baby's first days on the earth . 'Kids never do what you want them to do – ask them to stand still and smile nicely and you'll invariably get scowls, creepy grins, and silly faces. 'I quickly discovered the best way to really capture your child is to photograph them in action.' Neil is not unaware of the fact that many people are capable of photographing their own babies however, she says that the service she provides is far more sentimental. 'Many people have access to specialist cameras and photography equipment nowadays, but my shoots are as much about the experience as the end product. Out of this world: In this inventive image Neil has used a paper plate to recreate a space helmet . Having a whale of a time: When she first started out Neil's photographs were far more humble with babies posing in knitted hats they have since got far more elaborate . 'For many parents the shoots are the first time they've shown off their newborn to the world, and they want to capture such a special moment with a professional photo, captured by someone with a trained eye and plenty of experience.' Neil says that it is her combination of personal experience and professionalism makes her photos so special. 'Luckily, my lifetime spent as a photographer and my role as a loving mother puts me in a unique position to offer an unforgettable experience for parents – with a beautiful collection of photos they can take away.' Out and about: Neil says that the babies are completely comfortable in her photographs . Festive fun: One baby poses as part of Santa Claus's washing line in this Christmas-themed shoot . Doting mother: Neil is pictured here with her son Leonardo .","Neil Prahova takes pictures of new babies set in elaborate scenes .

"The world's largest union for flight attendants says passengers should be forced to stow their mobile phones during take-off and landing. The Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) is suing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), arguing that the reversal on a long-standing ban is causing passengers to ignore safety announcements and could turn smartphones into dangerous projectiles if not stowed properly. Laws have been passed that allow the use of mobile devices during flights, but the AFA believes they are inadmissible due to insufficient debate and lack of clarity of what training would be provided. The European Aviation Safety Agency in Germany has issued new guidelines. They state that passengers can use portable electronics, including phones and tablets, at any time during flights . And, while acknowledging that testing of devices on board is important for navigation purposes, the union's main focus is on the stowage of electronic devices. A spokesman for the union told MailOnline: 'AFA is only concerned about the stowage issue. 'If portable electronic devices can be safely left on during take-off and landing, they must still be properly stowed during take-off and landing so that in a sudden stop or deceleration, they won’t fly out of passengers' hands and injure others in the cabin, including the first responder flight attendants who are needed to conduct the evacuation, or impede and hinder emergency evacuation through the aisles. 'We have significant concerns on this particular topic for crew and passenger safety in the cabin, but it's also a matter of protecting the rulemaking process when considering any future changes to regulations.' A spokesman for the flight attendants' union says it is only concerned about the stowage issue . British Airways has already decided to let passengers use wifi and send texts . The union highlighted that devices can distract passengers from safety announcements and become dangerous projectiles. The AFA also says that in letting passengers keep the devices out, the Federal Aviation Administration changed an agency regulation without steps required by law. 'Any time there is a change in aviation safety regulations, the law requires a notice of proposed rulemaking and opportunity for public comment. 'The FAA announcement that some portable electronic devices no longer need to be safely stowed during take-off and landing changed the existing stowage rule without following a formal rule making process. 'This announcement, which changed existing practice overnight, failed to consider training for flight crews who would be charged with implementing the new rule and increases the risks of injury to crew and passengers when evacuating an airplane in an emergency.' A case brought by the Association of Flight Attendants to ban the use of electronic devices on take-off and landing looks to have failed . But the judges hearing the case suggested they won't be prying portable electronics out of passengers' hands. 'Airlines have always had discretion on how to handle this,' Judge Harry T. Edwards told a lawyer for the 60,000-member union. Judge Janice Rogers Brown asked about the flight attendants' concern that allowing passengers to keep out electronics leaves 'more things to fly around' the airplane cabin during turbulence. But a lawyer for the government, Jeffrey Sandberg, told the judges that cellphones and other small devices are no more dangerous than books that passengers have been allowed to keep out. British Airways, who have pushed on with mobile allowances on their flights, have already allow the use of voice calls after landing. They have no plans to permit the use of mobile phones for voice calls during flights as  feedback from customers has shown the majority of them find them an intrusion and disruptive. But customers can use their mobile phones and other handheld devices, to send and receive texts, emails and data on their Club World London City service, which also offers internet access between London and New York. BA are in discussions with Inmarsat about leading Europe in a new era of broadband in the air. Starting with UK domestic routes we intend to roll-out Europe’s first ground-based 4G broadband network giving customers the internet access they expect on the ground while in the air. The FAA does insist that mobiles are put into airplane mode for flights however, but passengers can still listen to music and watch downloaded movies or television programmes. The court will issue a written ruling at a later date. The case will have provoked interest from Europe after the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) last month relaxed the rules on electronic devices on flights. Passengers flying into or out of Europe will now be able to use portable electronics including phones and tablets at any time during their flights. Starting immediately, European-based airlines can, at their own discretion, allow passengers to leave electronics on throughout the entire flight, without putting them into airplane mode. But airlines will need to certify their planes aren't affected by transmission signals before allowing devices to be used. Spokesman Ilias Maragakis for the EASA said the plans are a step beyond what's allowed by the US FAA. ‘We're basically opening the door where, in theory, you'll be able to continue making your phone call through the gate throughout the flight, like you would on a train.’ British Airways already lets passengers on its business class flights from London to New York to use wifi and send texts, and is starting to relax the regulations on other flights as well. A spokesman for the UK's Civil Aviation Authority said: 'The ruling means it's now up to the airlines to what they allow, but obviously they have to go through certain tests and procedures. 'But it could be that you can use your mobile and other devices just like you would in a car, train or other form of transport. 'The ruling is a legally binding document, so it's something that has to be accepted.'","Last month rules changed in Europe regarding use of mobiles on planes .

"You have reluctantly dragged yourself out of bed, avoided rush hour traffic and made it into work on time. Just as it seems as if you are on to a rare, not-so-bad Monday morning, a colleague turns to you and asks: 'So, what did you get up to this weekend?' When asked this question, one in three British workers feel compelled to lie to make themselves seem more interesting, a new study has revealed. Don't even ask: One in three workers suffer from 'weekendvy', compelling them to lie to colleagues about what they got up to at the weekend (picture posed by model) A third of workers suffer from 'weekendvy' - where they are economical with the truth so they appear as adventurous as their colleagues. The study, commissioned by Travelodge, asked 3,000 adults across the UK what they told workmates when they were asked how their weekend was. The pressure of seeming like a fun-loving person leads thousands to lie about what they did, with the most popular mistruth being that they went out on the town on a Saturday night. Other top lies include dining at a top restaurant, going on a romantic holiday in the UK, or going on a training course. The secret competition between colleagues appears to be a vicious circle, however, with almost three-quarters of adults believing that they are having less weekend fun than others. Psychologist Corinne Sweet  said: 'The psychological condition, ‘Weekendvy’ that’s currently hitting Britain is to do with needing to feel like an alpha male or female with high status. 'We don’t want to admit that most of our weekend time is spent trying to catch up with housework, paperwork and endless chores. 'It’s the horrible feeling that everyone else is having a better time than us, going away, partying or having fun.' I'm fun really: Workers tell the lies so they appear more interesting in the eyes of their colleagues, the most popular lie being that they went out on the town on Saturday night (picture posed by model) 1) Painted the town red on Saturday night with their partner or friends. 2) Took part in an adventurous activity. 3) Went on a course or training programme. 4) Went out for a fancy dinner at a top restaurant. 5) Took a romantic break in the UK (but actually just re-told a story of a previous holiday.","A third of workers lie about their weekend to impress colleagues, study says .

"With smartwatches  rising in popularity, figuring out how best to input text onto them has become a bit of an issue. But Microsoft thinks they've got part of an answer with their handwriting tool. Called the Analog Keyboard Project, it lets a user draw letters, numbers and even symbols in the middle of watch, which are then registered by the device. Scroll down for video . Researchers at Microsoft's Redmond base in Washington have developed a writing tool for Android smart watches. The Analog Keyboard Project lets users write on the middle of the watch (shown). It can recognise letters, numbers and also some symbols . The prototype reported by Gizmodo is compatible both with square Android watches and the circular Moto 360 so far. Most smartwatches currently employ some form of speech recognition to carry out most tasks. Write lowercase - You can enter lowercase English letters (print), numbers, and basic punctuation symbols. Uppercase letters are not supported. Start slowly and neatly - When using the prototype for the first time, watch the fading strokes on the writing panel and make sure they are legible and properly separated from one another. The recognition accuracy should be fairly high that way. Then try to develop a sense for how sloppy you can write while still getting good accuracy. Frequent words like 'this', 'and', 'is' and so on will often be auto-corrected by the system once all characters have been entered, so it's generally faster to finish writing these words even if there are wrong letters along the way. Rare words on the other hand, like names or hashtags, should be written slowly and verified character by character (auto-correct is suppressed if you pause a little after each character). The backspace key has a repeat function when you hold it down. But, as the Microsoft Research team points out, there are some situations where speaking to your watch is either not appropriate or possible. 'With the Analog Keyboard Project we are exploring handwriting recognition for text input on small touch screens,' the team writes on their site. 'Handwriting, unlike speech, is discreet and not prone to background noise.' They also add that a handwriting method allows the whole screen to be used for each character, rather than classic typing methods where part of the screen must be obscured. This leaves room on the left for a large backspace button, and on the right for a space bar button. For now only lowercase English letters, numbers and basic punctuation symbols can be used. The team advises that you should write slowly and neatly at first in order for the recognition software to get to grips with your writing style. In addition words will be auto-corrected so, they note, it is often quicker to finish a word if an error is made rather than going back to fix something. While it is available for download now, the team notes that it should be for research purposes only as it is still in a very early stage.

"A gold ring engraved with a romantic message has been unearthed centuries after it was last seen. Amateur treasure hunter Morley Howard was metal detecting in a newly ploughed field in Highbridge, Somerset, when he made his discovery. The ring, with a Lord of the Rings-style inscription reading 'In thee my choys I do rejoys' is thought to be a 300-year-old posy ring, traditionally given by lovers in Elizabethan times. Mr Howard, from Burnham-on-Sea, is now waiting for the ring to be dated by the British Museum. Scroll down for video . Amateur treasure hunter Morley Howard found this inscribed ring in a field in Highbridge, Somerset . Mr Howard, of Burnham-on-Sea, said the ring is the most exciting find he's had in four years of treasure hunting . He said: 'When previously metal detecting on this land I'd only unearthed pre-decimal and modern items, but when the farmer recently ploughed the land, I thought I'd give it a couple of hours again.' 'My metal detector was quiet initially, but just as I was about to turn around, my machine gave a good strong signal and I dug a small plug and lifted the soil to reveal a small band of yellow. 'It was a marvellous moment - I thought what a loss it must have been for the owner at the time, but it was also a joy for me to get a treasure find.' He took the ring to the Somerset Heritage Centre before sending it on to the British Museum where it will be verified by jewellery experts. But Mr Howard believes it is an Elizabethan posy ring, which were traditionally given by lovers with romantic messages engraved on the inside in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. He said: ''Many posy rings were made for women and are smaller, but this one is a male ring and weighs 6.8 grams.  It's hard to date as there are no maker's initials or hallmarks. In Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, the ring, pictured left, and right with Gollum, is inscribed in Elvish . Mr Howard said he'd searched the field before but decided to have another go after it was ploughed . The inscription reads: 'In thee my choys I do rejoys', which is a typical message found in gold posy rings . 'These posy rings can have a value of between £1,500-£4,000, and if it's proven to be more than 300 years old it will be offered to a local museum to acquire. 'If a museum wants it, they'll have to pay the land owner 50 per cent and myself 50 per cent once it's been valued. 'If the ring is not acquired by a museum, then it's returned to me and the land owner and we'll decide what to do with it.' The inscription is typical for a ring of the period. Burnham-on-Sea dates back to Roman times, making it a favourite with treasure hunters.  In 1607 the Bristol Channel flooded, swamping Burnham and leaving many treasures buried under the mud the water brought.","Amateur treasure hunter Morley Howard found ring in newly ploughed field .

"Plan: Tory MPs will challenge David Cameron over migrants from Eastern Europe, telling him not to open Britain's borders on January 1 . Tory MPs will challenge  David Cameron over Romanian and Bulgarian migrants today – urging him not to  throw open Britain’s borders from next year. Backbench support is coalescing around a plan to extend restrictions on new arrivals from the two eastern European countries, due to expire on January 1, for a further five years. Dozens of Tory MPs are likely to back the measure and put huge pressure on the Prime Minister to defy the European Union over its cherished free movement rules. The proposal will be heard by a committee of MPs today and could come before a full vote in the House of Commons within weeks. Nigel Mills, the MP for Amber Valley in Derbyshire, is spearheading the campaign. His proposed changes to the Government’s Immigration Bill currently passing through the House of Commons would extend restrictions until the end of December 2018. Extending restrictions on migrant workers would provoke squeals of outrage – and likely legal challenge – from Brussels. But supporters say it would prevent huge pressure being placed on public services, including the NHS, and on jobs at a time when many British workers are struggling to find employment. It would also allow Mr Cameron to make a defiant stand over two crucial issues for his supporters – Europe and immigration – where he is seen to be leaking support to Ukip. Last night Mr Mills warned the economy ‘cannot cope’ with another large influx of migrants. He said: ‘The Government is putting through a very worthwhile Immigration Bill which introduces a number of measures most people concerned about immigration will welcome. Controls: Border Agency officials evict Romanian migrants. In 2007, when the country joined the EU, 'transitional controls' were applied which meant migrants must have a job offer in order to cross the border . Plan: Nigel Mills MP, pictured, proposes that restrictions are extended for five more years - until 2018. His plan will be heard by a committee of MPs today . ‘But what we don’t have are any measures on Romanian and Bulgarian migrants, which is what people mention if you ask them about immigration. ‘Quite rightly, people want to know what will happen from January. The unofficial forecast would mean a quarter of a million people coming here over the next five years. ‘People are quite rightly concerned about whether public services can cope, about what benefits they will claim and about the number of jobs they will take.’ There is no official estimate of possible new arrivals in the UK when working restrictions are dropped for 29million Romanian and Bulgarian nationals, but migration campaigners predict it could be 50,000 a year. Any movement of this order would decimate Mr Cameron’s pledge to cut yearly net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ by 2015. Currently that figure stands at 176,000 which is down from more than a quarter of a million in 2010 but still short of Mr Cameron’s target. Mr Mills pointed to 2004 when Labour ministers did not adopt temporary restrictions on migrant workers from Poland and seven other new EU countries. More than a million migrants  arrived in Britain  despite official predictions that just 13,000 would come. A Home Office spokesman said last night: ‘This government has extended transitional controls to the maximum period of December 31. There is no power to extend them further as we are bound by the terms of the Accession Treaties negotiated by the previous Government. ‘We are focusing on cutting out the abuse of free movement between EU member states and addressing the factors that drive European immigration to Britain. ‘We are working to ensure our controls on accessing benefits and services are among the tightest in Europe to protect the UK from abuse.’ Eight out of ten newly qualified Bulgarian doctors are planning to work abroad, a study has shown. In a questionnaire put to graduates from Bulgaria’s largest medical school in Sofia, the majority said they planned to leave their country, with preferences for working in Britain and Germany. One vascular surgeon told the BBC he could earn seven times more in the UK. But most Bulgarian doctors cite their reason for wanting to move as being due to corruption concerns within their own health service.","Restrictions on arrivals from Romania and Bulgaria to expire on January 1 .

"If eating bacteria-laden meat doesn’t sound appetising, then how about eating meat wrapped in a bug-killing film? That’s the idea behind a bizarre material developed by U.S. researchers that could help prevent meat from spoiling. As well as killing harmful bacteria, the film is edible and the researchers hope the product will some day be used in a similar way to a sausage casing. A bizarre material developed by U.S. researchers could help prevent meat from spoiling by using essential oils and nanoparticles. Scientists at Pennsylvania State University hope the edible material will some day be used to wrap meat products, in a similar way to a sausage casing . So far, four different versions of the material have been developed by a team at Pennsylvania State University, led by Professor Catherine Cutter. The antibacterial ingredients in the materials are made up of either rosemary oil, oregano essential oil, zinc oxide or silver nanoparticles. Those ingredients are combined within a layer of pullulan, which is a tasteless edible plastic created by the Aureobasidium pulluns fungus. Pullulan is used as a film in breath freshening tabs that disintegrate on the tongue and capsules that disintegrate in the stomach. The antibacterial ingredients in the materials are made up of a mixture of rosemary or oregano essential oils, or zinc oxide or silver nanoparticles. Those ingredients are combined within a layer of pullulan, which is a tasteless edible polymer created by the Aureobasidium pulluns fungus (pictured) Everyone's done it - dropped food on the floor but still eaten it because of the so-called ‘five second’ rule. A team of microbiologists has now put this theory to the test to prove once and for all whether this rule does apply. The research was carried out by final year Biology students from Aston University. The food included toast, pasta, biscuits and sticky sweets and they were timed from three to 30 seconds. The findings confirmed that time is significant in the transfer of bacteria, but the type of flooring is the deciding factor. Carpeted surfaces were least likely to transfer bacteria, over any period of time - and this was the case for all four food types. Across the board, toast was the food least likely to pick up bacteria from any of the flooring types but only if it was dry. Toast with butter or jam increased the likelihood of picking up germs. Moist foods, including pasta and sweets could be picked up within the five-second window and not pick up bacteria – but after five seconds, the risk of infection jumped. Once meat is wrapped in the film, the pullulan sticks to its surface, gradually dissolving and slowly releasing its anti-bacterial cocktail into the meat. During the study, meat products were first injected with bacterial pathogens, then vacuum-packed in the film and stored in a fridge for up to three weeks. When they were analysed, the four different types of edible film were found to be fresher than samples that had been packed in conventional polyethylene film. ‘The results from this study demonstrated that edible films made from pullulan and incorporated with essential oils or nanoparticles have the potential to improve the safety of refrigerated, fresh or further-processed meat and poultry products,’ said Professor Cutter. ‘The research shows that we can apply these food-grade films and have them do double duty -- releasing antimicrobials and imparting characteristics to protect and improve food we eat.’ The safety of eating such a film, however, is still under question.  The researchers claim that regulators still require evidence that nanoparticles are not harmful to the human body when eaten. ‘The meat industry likes the properties of the polyethylene vacuum packaging materials that they are using now,’ she said. Knowing that edible films can release antimicrobials slowly over time and keep bacteria in meat at bay, further research will be aimed at creating what Cutter referred to as ‘active packaging’ - polyethylene film with antimicrobial properties. ‘Right now, we have two different packaging materials that are not necessarily compatible, leading to a two-step process,’ said Professor Cutter. ‘I keep thinking there's a way to extrude edible, antimicrobial film in one layer with polyethylene, creating all-in-one packaging. ‘The chemistry of binding the two together is the challenge, but we need to find a way to do it because marrying the two materials together in packaging would make foods - especially meat and poultry - safer to eat.’","Anti-bacterial ingredients are combined in layer of tasteless edible plastic .

"When the first screenshots of Infinity Blade appeared for iPhone, gamers were quick to dimiss them as fakes. But not only was the swords-and-sorcery game real, it went on to become a $10 million-selling hit - the fastest-selling iPhone game ever. The sequel, Infinity Blade 2, comes out today for both iPhone and iPad - and looks set to accelerate a trend that has seen Sony and Nintendo's portable-gaming market share plunge from 91 per cent two years ago to just 42 per cent now. The game will only run on phones with Apple's new fast A5 processors - found in iPhone 4S and iPad 2 . The original Infinity Blade was the fastest-selling game ever on Apple's IPhone. The sequel adds faster-paced, more complex combat . Magic spells are created by 'drawing' a rune on screen: The game's success was at least partially due to the fact it was BUILT for touchscreens, rather than a normal game . The game only works on handsets with the fast A5 processor - the iPhone 4S and iPad 2 - hence the top-end 3D graphics, created by Epic Games, also behind console hits such as Gears of War 3. On review-aggregator site Metacritic, its average score is 95 per cent. TouchArcade said, 'We put incredibly powerful devices in our pockets and on our laps daily, but rarely do we see games that utterly embrace this like Infinity Blade has. It's a showcase piece; a technically and visually gifted game that consistently delivers eye-popping stuff.' Like the first game, it's built to be controlled by touchscreen - you swipe and parry across the screen, and unleash magical spells by drawing runes. It's also almost certain to be followed by money-spinning expansions: the last game had four. The game is accompanied by a book by fantasy author Brandon Sanderson. The range of beasts to battle has expanded - but the basic combat system is still a simple matter of hitting buttons in time . The game will expand on the plot of the first one - which had a rather cryptic ending revealing that the God-King who you battled may not be a villain at alll... The game now features a crossbow-wielding heroine, Asian locations - and an even more cryptic plot. 'The continuing journey of young Siris unfolds as you delve deeper into the world of the Deathless tyrants and their legion of Titans,' say the game's markers. 'Can you unlock all the mysteries and successfully wield the power of the Infinity Blade in this timeless adventure of champions and villains?'","Sequel to fastest-selling iPhone game ever .

"Several passengers became ill when a commercial jet carrying more than 200 people was rocked by strong winds during a ‘horror flight’ in Australia. The turbulent conditions prevented the Cathay Pacific flight from landing at Melbourne Airport, so it was forced to divert to Avalon Airport, southwest of Australia’s second largest city. But passengers who went through the unsettling experience were stranded on the plane for several hours after the aircraft made a safe landing. Bumpy ride: Several passengers became ill after a Cathay Pacific flight was rocked by strong winds . Passengers said the Airbus A330, flying from Hong Kong to Melbourne, diverted after two aborted landings at Melbourne Airport late Saturday night. Ted Szkuta told radio station 3AW that the plane was ‘rocking severely’ as it attempted to land. He said: ‘I started feeling a bit seasick. It was very uncomfortable.’ After the plane made a smooth landing in Avalon, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection did not allow passengers to disembark, Mr Szkuta told the radio station. Rattled passengers remained on the aircraft for over four hours – they lost an hour to daylight saving time – but two were allowed to leave with paramedics due to medical conditions. Mr Szkuta said: ‘One person had a bit of an issue of, I think, claustrophobia or something because they gave the woman oxygen.’ Stranded: The passengers were stuck on the plane for over four hours before it returned to Melbourne Airport . The plane refuelled and was inspected by technicians before it flew back to Melbourne Airport, where it landed around 6am on Sunday – nearly seven hours behind schedule. Passenger Simon O’Dea saluted Cathay Pacific staff for the way they handled the situation. He said on Twitter: ‘@cathaypacificAU want to commend your staff at Melbourne check in for today's HK flight, so professional and helpful in difficult situation.’ Airservices Australia spokeswoman Vicki Huggins told the Herald Sun that two other planes were affected by severe winds and had to circle Melbourne Airport before landing.","Flight from Hong Kong had two aborted landings at Melbourne Airport .

"A third grader who was giving an anti-violence speech in New Jersey on Saturday was left stunned when the sound of gunshots rang out in the middle of his message. Nyeeam Hudson, 8, was speaking to a crowd of people in a basement on Prince Street, New Jersey when a loud popping sound of gunshots occurred behind him. His speech was dedicated to ways that ongoing violence in New Jersey could be stamped out and he urged the crowd to remain ‘thankful’ despite a spate of murders in the area. Scroll down for video . Speech: Nyeeam Hudson, 8, was speaking to a crowd of people in a basement on Prince Street, New Jersey . Shock: The third grader stopped his speech to look behind him after the noise startled everyone in the room . But as the sound of gunshots rattled off loudly, the youth, who appears to be wise beyond his years, immediately spun around to try and identify what exactly had taken place outside. Police later confirmed that a man had been shot multiple times on the 100th block of Prince Street. The 23-year-old man, was found alive, clinging to life, but was pronounced dead at University Hospital nearby  shortly after. Anthony Ambrose, chief of detectives for the Essex County Prosecutor's Office said in a statement that no arrests had been made in the shooting, and an investigation is ongoing. He also confirmed that detectives recovered seven 7.62-millimeter shell casings at the scene. Location: Police later confirmed that a man had been shot multiple times on the 100th block of Prince Street. The third-grader was one of several poets and artists speaking at ‘Poetry on the Move’ a program put on by non-profit organization FP YouthOutCry Foundation, Inc. and local Mayor Ras Baraka. The organization is dedicated to empowering youth to stay away from violence and aims to provide a safe haven for children and teens in New Jersey through arts classes and other activities. Susan Schessler, Director of Development for the foundation told NJ.com: 'It wasn’t what people describe as firecracker, ‘pop pop pop.’ 'It sounded like a fence falling. It was a loud sustained noise, and then it was over.’ The timing of the shooting was particularly poignant for everyone who had gathered in the  organization’s clubhouse known as the HUBB. The murder marks the city's 70th so far this year and the third of the week, according to authorities. Others present included representatives from Baraka’s Division of Arts, Cultural Development and Tourism. Al-Tariq Best, founder of FP YouthOutCry posted a video of the incident on the organization’s Facebook page. Organizer: Al-Tariq Best bemoaned the lack of media presence for the initial poetry event . The video included a message bemoaning the media presence for the initial poetry event which had gone unnoticed until there was a shooting. He said: ‘Guess what? They came out today, because a young boy’s life was ended, on Prince Street.' Future leader: ‘As I was speaking about violence, violence happened, and I think as a people we can do better' Hudson said . ‘While the youth was expressing itself, we heard the shots of a youth taken away.’ Schessler added: ‘It was very powerful, because the kid was really talking about the simplicity of life and being happy with what we have, and that violence is turning people’s heads and destroying lives. 'And then we hear this barrage of gunshots. It was such a stark contrast.’ The group decided to soldier on with their anti violence message, despite the murder taking place. Schessler said: ‘It would be contrary to the spirit of the HUBB, because that’s the whole purpose, is to bring kids into another world, right in the midst of their violent world.' Hudson said he did not initially realize the loud sounds that interrupted him were gunshots. ‘As I was speaking about violence, violence happened, and I think as a people we can do better,’ he said.","Nyeeam Hudson, 8, was giving a speech to an audience in New Jersey .

"4: Neymar (Brazil) 3: Thomas Muller (Germany), Arjen Robben (Holland), Robin van Persie (Holland), Enner Valencia (Ecuador), Karim Benzema (France) 2: Mario Mandzukic (Croatia), Lionel Messi (Argentina), Andre Ayew (Ghana), Gervinho (Ivory Coast), James Rodriguez (Colombia), Clint Dempsey (USA), Tim Cahill (Australia), Luis Suarez (Uruguay), Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Memphis Depay (Holland) The 2014 version of the Brazil national football team is so full of holes it remains distinctly possible that somebody could yet give them a rather embarrassing hiding over the next fortnight. Nevertheless, in the shape of their remarkable forward Neymar they boast a young footballer who seems determined to make this World Cup his own. Can one player drive a nation to the ultimate glory all by himself? Maybe not but he can make a heck of a difference and in the capital of his country last night, Neymar ensured his team ended the group stages on a rapturous high. Certainly the Barcelona forward has tapped in to the emotion and warmth of this tournament. On Monday night he got pushed in to the photographers by one Cameroon player and slapped in the face by another. He responded with goals, though, beautiful goals, and after each he was waving his arms at the crowd, imploring them to offer more from the towering stands of the magnificent Estadio Nacional.

Referee: Jonas Eriksson (Sweden) 6.5 . It was a terrific sight, even if it didn’t completely mask Brazil’s frailties. There are simply too many of those to ignore but – after the lumbering Fred added a third goal in the second half and Manchester City’s Fernandinho came on to score a fantastic fourth  - it ensured that 70,000 people went home optimistic rather than concerned for the durability of Luiz Felipe Scolari’s side. As the dust settled, it was hard to ignore Fernandinho’s impact. It is rather mysterious why Scolari doesn’t start with him. He is exactly the kind of pragmatic, intuitive holding player that this team needs. The goal he scored was lovely, too. By the end, as Cameroon tired and ragged, Brazil had begun to knock the ball around with confidence and played their best football of the night and perhaps even the tournament so far. Fernandinho’s goal came on the back of that football as four passes were exchanged to allow him to advance and poke a perfect shot across goalkeeper Charles Itandje and in to the far corner. As auditions for a place in the last sixteen tie against Chile go, it was pretty convincing stuff from a player who did so much to assist City’s reclaiming of the Barclays Premier League trophy. It is hard, though, to watch this Brazil team without being drawn to the sight of Neymar’s imperious play. A footballer with perfect balance, dextrous feet and a scrapper’s heart, he is a middleweight who punching ferociously at the highest level. On Monday night Brazil did what Brazil do, which is to look capable and completely incapable at the same time, depending on which half of the field you were looking at. This is a team that often looks lost when it doesn’t have the ball, a team through which panic spreads when even the most basic set-piece is delivered in to their penalty area. Follow my lead: Neymar scored again in the 34th minute as he strike got the better of Charles Itandje .

Click here to see more from our brilliant Match Zone - including this touch map of Neymar's second goal of the game . But when he needed them to calm their nerves, Neymar did not fail them. That is why he is the talisman of Scolari’s team. Shoved in to the hoardings by Allan Nyom early on here, Brazil’s golden child ignored the offer of a handshake and exacted perfect retribution by scoring the opening goal. Luiz Gustavo hussled for – and won – the ball down the left and advanced to cross low towards Neymar who opened his body and side-footed the ball left to right across Itandje and in to the corner. It was a super goal. Moments later Neymar crashed a volley goalwards from 18 yards and though Itandje saved it looked as though Brazil would run riot. Instead their own defensive frailties allowed Cameroon back in to the contest and for 15 minutes we saw the very worst of the hosts. Gap: The Brazilian forward wheels away to celebrate giving the Selecao a 3-1 lead . Royalty: Prince Harry (centre) applauds after Brazil's second goal of the game . Dani Alves sliced one cross over his own bar in the 25th minute and then headed a corner against his own post and over. From the next set piece Cameroon scored. The ball was cleared to the left side and when Nyom picked it up, beat the flat-footed Alves at the second attempt and crossed low to the far post, David Luiz was caught on his heels as Joel Matip ambled in to score. It was an equaliser that Cameroon deserved. They had shown some spirit and some ambition. Pain: Neymar was substituted in the 71st minute after jarring his knee but it was though to be a precaution . Jubilant: David Luiz (left) roars with delight as his team all but secure a place in the last 16 . Complaining: Marcelo shouts after being fouled in the first half . Soon, though, Neymar arrived to hurt them again, running on to a Marcelo header, cutting inside on to his right foot to shoot low to the goalkeeper’s left from 18 yards. That rather discouraged Cameroon and thereafter there was just one winner. Fred looked offside when he headed in Luiz’s cross in the 50th minute but as Brazil flourished late on there was no disputing the quality of Fernandinho’s goal. By then Neymar had departed after one heavy tackle too many. A nation will pray for his recovery. In the air: The Barcelona star falls during the Group A World Cup clash .

"Harry Redknapp insists reviving the wing-back formation could hold the key to QPR's chances of Barclays Premier League survival. The former Tottenham boss admitted surprise at the number of national sides favouring a return to 3-5-2 in Brazil's summer World Cup. Redknapp delayed Rangers' move to three at the back last term, but now feels confident he has the personnel to pull off the notoriously tricky set-up. Scroll down for videos... Tinker man: Harry Redknapp believes wing-back formation will help QPR stay up this season . Wide boys: Armand Traore (L) and Jordan Mutch are tailormade for the wing back roles . The QPR manager believes Armand Traore and Jordon Mutch can operate as natural left wing-backs, with Danny Simpson and Mauricio Isla slotting in on the right. 'Traore should be perfect, that's what he is, a wing-back, he's not a left-back really,' said Redknapp, ahead of Saturday's league opener against Hull at Loftus Road. 'He's half a left-back and half a left winger really. 'So really he's a wing-back, that's what he does, so it's perfect for him. 'And Jordon should be the same on the left side, he's an attacking player who can run all day. 'So I've got two people on the left side, and I've got Danny Simpson and Isla on the right. 'Isla can play three or four positions, because he can play anywhere in midfield. 'So he's a good acquisition.' Manchester United boss Louis Van Gaal has ushered in a back-three system at Old Trafford, with the long-defunct formation making an unlikely comeback. Redknapp does not expect the Premier League to be awash with wing-backs as in the mid-nineties, but admitted it remains a formation he favours. The 67-year-old pledged to dispense with his plan if the changes fail to bear fruit, but warned his squad to cope with the new tactical blueprint. 'The players will just be pleased to be playing, they shouldn't worry too much about the formation,' said Redknapp, keen to field two strikers without sacrificing midfield bite. 'At the end of the day, whatever the system, they get on with it. 'They've got to play and get on with it: if they don't, then unlucky really. 'It was difficult to do it last year as we didn't quite have the players. Dutch of class: United boss Louis van Gaal is expected to use the 3-5-2 sytem that he served him well in Brazil . 'It was a surprise to see so many teams playing that way at the World Cup, but it was in my mind long, long before the World Cup to play that way. 'It's a system I've always liked. 'Hopefully it's something that can work for us, and certainly our first objective of course is to try to stay in the league. 'There will probably only be two or three teams playing that way in the league. 'It enables you to get two strikers in the team. 'People have had problems getting two strikers in because unless you play 4-4-2 you're getting overrun with two midfield players. 'So that is a problem if the other team play with three in there, and that's why most teams play with one striker these days. 'This way it enables you to get three midfielders and two strikers.' Meeting of minds: The QPR boss has hailed new coach Glenn Hoddle's impact at Loftus Road . Redknapp hailed new first team coach Glenn Hoddle's immediate impact - but rejected suggestions the former Tottenham midfielder is his long-term managerial successor at the west London club. Hoddle is the second former England manager to work in Redknapp's Rangers backroom staff after Steve McClaren. The ex-West Ham boss said he does not envisage stepping out of frontline management in the near future. 'For years I've felt it was an absolute waste, for someone of Glenn's knowledge and ability not to be working out on the training ground with players every day. 'So when the opportunity came I rung him up, and asked him if he'd be interested. 'We had a couple of meetings and he said he was well up for it, so I couldn't be more pleased. 'I had Steven McClaren previously, so I've had two former England managers now - and they are one million per cent my appointments. Getting ready: Rio Ferdinand (C) trains ahead of QPR's opening Premier League game against Hull . 'No-one at the club suggested Glenn to me, it was totally my call. 'Obviously when I went to speak to Steve I had the same problem as with Glenn - would they fancy it having been England manager? 'Steve did it and he was great while he was here, before going off to manage Derby, and now Glenn's come in and I couldn't be more pleased. 'I've not had enough, that's way down the line and it wouldn't be my decision as to when I finish anyway. 'Glenn's here to get out on the training pitch and work with the players.'

"A man has been stung multiple times while paddle boarding at a popular water activity spot in Rose Bay, in Sydney's east. The man, believed to be in his 50s, was heard screaming for help after he fell feet first into the ocean and landed directly on a stingray. At the time of the incident, the man and his son-in-law were the only ones paddle-boarding in the area on Friday morning. Scroll down for video . An elderly man has been stung multiple times while paddle boarding at a popular water activity spot in Rose Bay, in Sydney's east . The man, believed to be in his 50s, was heard screaming for help after his foot was stabbed by a stingray . Tommy Woodruff, part owner of Rose Bay Aquatic Hire told Daily Mail Australia that he had hired two paddle-boards at around 11.00am. 'He happened to fall off the board and fell directly on the stingray, which is really, really unlucky,' Mr Woodruff said. 'He was in a lot of pain and it took a bit to reassure him. Steve Irwin 'The Crocodile Hunter', who was famed for his daring stunts with dangerous animals, died in 2006 after he was stabbed by a giant stingray as he made a documentary on the Great Barrier Reef. The larger-than-life TV personality was 44-years-old when the stingray stabbed him hundreds of times, with one of the blows fatally piercing his heart. A cameraman who witnessed Irwin's death said he got into the water and approached the huge ray from behind before it lashed out, apparently believing the shadow was a shark. Mr Woodruff said stingray injuries occur quite frequently, but this time of the year it is uncommon. 'If it does happen it is on a low tide - it was mid tide coming in and he was right out on the sand bay. 'If it is low tide we always reassure people and get them to shackle their feet. 'People need to know they are not going to die from it - I've been through it - it is very common. 'Steve Irwin died from a massive one and it went directly through his heart - we don’t have those big ones down here' Rose Bay Aquatic Hire had paddle-boarders go back to the sand board, where they spotted the stingray. Mr Woodruff said his biggest concern was to prevent the man from going into shock. 'We were straight onto it - we poured hot to boiling water, whatever he could withstand, to submerge the sting. 'That is all that we could do until paramedics could give him something for the pain.' Passer-bys rushed to the man's aid and called triple 000 at around 11.18am on Friday . Paramedics treated the injured man on the scene, after suffering a severe reaction to the sting . Mr Woodruff called triple 000 at around 11.18am on Friday.

Jabbari was sentenced to death in 2009 for stabbing to death a former employee of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence, Morteza Abdolali Sarbandi. The incident - which took place two years earlier in 2007, when Jabbari was just 19-years-old - occurred when Sarbandi met the former decorator in a cafe and convinced her to visit his office to discuss a business deal. While there Sarbandi allegedly drugged and attempted to rape Jabbari, who grabbed a pocket knife and stabbed the civil servant - fleeing the scene as he bled to death. Jabbari's execution was first postponed in April after a global petition to spare her life attracted 20,000 signatures. The punishment was rescheduled for this week, but on Monday it was deferred once again - apparently after Jabbari had said her final goodbyes to her family, while a government car waited outside Rajai Shahr Prison, near Tehran, to transport her to the execution site. Reyhaneh Jabbari handcuffed at police headquarters in Tehran after she was arrested for the murder of a former intelligence official in 2007. Amnesty International called the investigation and trial 'deeply flawed' Jabbari's friends and relatives, including Pakravan, are a regular sight outside the prison, staging regular protests asking for the 26-year-old to be released. The only thing I want in this universe is for Rayhaneh to be released. I have done everything I can think of,' Pakravan said. 'I am a mother. No mother can accept the death of her child, she added.' On Monday Amnesty International said the execution has only been delayed for 10 days - meaning Jabbari is likely to be killed next Friday. At the time of the postponement, her mother spoke about the heart-breaking farewell phone call she received from her daughter. 'I am currently handcuffed and there is a car waiting outside to take me for the execution of the sentence... Goodbye, dear Mum. All of my pains will finish early tomorrow morning,' Jabbari said. 'I'll see you in the next world and I will never leave you again because being separated from you is the most difficult thing to do in the world,' she added. A man who killed an Iranian youth  in a street fight with a knife in 2007, is brought to the gallows during his execution ceremony in the northern Iran city of Nowshahr. The mother of the victim spared his life soon after . There are numerous concerns over the way the case was handled by Iranian authorities. Amnesty reports she was placed in solitary confinement for two months, where she did not have access to a lawyer or her family. Last week Jabbari's mother said in a Facebook post that prison authorities told her she would have to go to the facility to 'collect the body' tomorrow. Raha Bahreini, rersearcher on Iran, told MailOnline that the threat of execution still looms, as under the Iranian law 'qesas' - or 'retribution-in-kind' - the family of the dead man can still demand she die. 'Instead of continuing to execute people, authorities in Iran should reform their judicial system, which dangerously relies on processes which fail to meet international law and standards for fair trial,' added Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Middle East and North Africa Deputy Director at Amnesty International. 'Under international human rights standards people charged with crimes punishable by death are entitled to the strictest observance of all fair trial guarantees.' The Secretariat of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, which opposes the nation's leadership, said Jabbari was secretly transferred between prisons in a bid to prevent protests by other inmates who are sympathetic to her plight. Revolutionary justice: Iranians watch the execution of two convicted gang rapists in 2002 . The organisation also claims that Jabbari underwent 'savage tortures' to extract a confession. A statement said: 'The misogynic regime of the mullahs is attempting to intensify the atmosphere of terror in the society and to terrorise all women and youth who have not succumbed to the oppression and vulgarly of regime's elements.' MEP Gérard Deprez, the chair of Friends of a Free Iran, a pressure group in the European Parliament, earlier called on Iran to halt the execution. He said: 'Hassan Rouhani's government has hanged more than 1,000 people, many of them in public squares in Iranian cities. This is the worst record by any Iranian president for the past 25 years. 'If human rights are not improving in Iran, continued talks will only be seen as a green light for further aggression by the regime against its people as well as spreading its terror to other countries of the region. 'It is time the west imposes sanctions on Iran's human rights violations with no further delay.'","Reyhaneh Jabbari, 26, was due to be hanged this week at an Iranian prison .

"Creaking floorboards, taps at the window and bumps in the night. At this time of year, it's less about home comforts and more about unwanted visitors of the supernatural variety. These are some of the world's most haunted hotels, and for the brave there's still time to book themselves in for a ghoulish Halloween night. Haunted: The Langham Hotel in Westminster is said to have been visited by the ghost of a German prince . The Langham Hotel, London . London's elegant Langham Hotel opened in 1865 and has accommodated royalty and literary greats including Mark Twain and Oscar Wilde. The grand Victorian hotel - home to the original afternoon tea - prides itself on 'service with poise', but some say it is frequented by a host of spectres. It is claimed several ghosts have been seen stalking the corridors and bedrooms - including a German doctor who reportedly murdered his wife before committing suicide while on honeymoon at the hotel, and a soldier who committed suicide by throwing himself off a balcony. The hotel's website says: 'In 1973 a BBC radio announcer James Alexander-Gordon awoke suddenly in the night to see a fluorescent ball which slowly took on the shape of a man wearing Victorian evening wear.' Luxury - and allegedly haunted - liner, The Queen Mary, is now permanently docked in Long Beach, California . The engine room  in the Queen Mary ocean liner, haunted by an engineer killed in a watertight door in 1967 . The Queen Mary, Long Beach, California . The stately Queen Mary was once the largest passenger ship in the world. Now a permanently docked hotel on Long Beach, California, since being retired in 1967, the vessel has been renovated to restore its authentic 1930s Art Deco style. The ghosts of two passengers who drowned are said to haunt the first class swimming pool, and a man in a 1930s suit has been spotted in the first class suites. During World War II,  300 of the ship's men drowned, and it is said that they can sometimes be heard pounding on the exterior walls, crying out for help. Cabin B340 has had so many disturbances that it's no longer rented. Ghost town hotel: The Jerome Grand Hotel in Arizona is said to be home to some very noisy spirits . Jerome Grand Hotel, Arizona . Jerome is Arizona's largest ghost town - in all senses of the word. By the 1950s the town's population had dwindled to just 100 and its reputation for haunted houses had become renowned in the area and across America. The Jerome Grand Hotel was built in 1926 as the United Verde Hospital. After it closed in 1950, the building remained unused for the next 44 years. The hotel website claims the area is one of the ten most haunted places in the whole of America. Some guests at the hotel have complained of laboured breathing and coughing noises coming from the corners of their rooms, others say they have felt physically touched by spirits while they slept - or at least tried to. Even supernatural guests enjoy the luxury offered at The Banff Springs Hotel in Alberta, Canada . The Banff Springs Hotel, Alberta, Canada . Canada's 'Castle in the Rockies' in the heart of Banff National Park, a Unesco World Heritage Site, has been providing luxurious hospitality to our guests for more than 125 years. The Fairmont Banff Springs is a year-round mountain resort with a golf course during the summer,  skiing in the winter and a year-round spa. But according to legend, many years ago a bride accidentally touched her dress to a candle on a flight of stairs. Her dress went up in flames and she fell down the stairs to her death. Guests report seeing her frequently roaming the halls of the hotel. The Stanley Hotel, in Estes Park, Colorado, was the inspiration for Stephen King's novel The Shining . Make yourself at home: The front lobby sitting area at the Stanley Hotel, where staff have seen several ghosts . The Stanley Hotel, Estes Park, Colorado . As well as hosting a variety of rich and famous guests, including RMS Titanic survivor Margaret Brown and Theodore Roosevelt, since its opening in 1909, The Stanley Hotel was the inspiration for Stephen King's The Shining. Within sight of the Rocky Mountain National Park, the Stanley offers panoramic views of the Rocky Mountains and its surrounding lands are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Ghosts of children have been spotted here, and their impressions left behind in mattresses. King himself reported that he saw a ghost of a small child on the second floor. Every year The Stanley celebrates the presence of the hotel's supernatural guests with its annual Shining Ball, a Halloween masquerade party, murder mystery dinners and a ghost adventure package, which includes a room on the haunted fourth floor.

"England are left clinging to the hope that Italy will beat Costa Rica on Friday night and then overcome Uruguay. That way the Three Lions could hatch a ‘Great Escape’ with a 2-0 win over Costa Rica next week providing Italy then beat Uruguay. Stranger things have happened. But of course should Roy Hodgson’s men lose to Costa Rica then this would rank as the country’s worst-ever World Cup finals. Down and (all-but) out: Steven Gerrard and Phil Jagielka reflect after England's defeat against Uruguay . Match winner: Luis Suarez is ecstatic after scoring Uruguay's crucial second goal against England in Sao Paolo . England have not lost all three group games at a World Cup since first entering in 1950; although England did lose their three group games at the 1988 European Championships. ........................................................................................................ Roy Hodgson has already batted off the ‘Will you resign?’ questions with a ‘No’. Publicly the FA stand firm behind the manager. Not least because chairman Greg Dyke suggested when he took over that a bloody nose was expected in Brazil but with a long term aim of a young side developing at Euro 2016. Hodgson is seen as the right man not least because there are no obvious or wiling replacements. But there are some around the FA who are not convinced and there is a growing feeling that despite no experience at club level Gary Neville could fit the bill. Successor? Some in the FA believe Gary Neville could fit the bill to replace Roy Hodgson as England manager . Just to confirm that while many Scottish football fans are revelling in England trouble's a pal from Glasgow rang me on Thursday to gloat about Uruguay's 2-1 win. He couldn't resist reading out the back page headline from one of the Scottish editions of the papers. It screamed: Eureka. As schadenfreude goes that's quality. Delighted: One Scottish football fan sat among the Uruguay supporters  during England's defeat . Keep out for left-footed players in today's games. Of the 47 World Cup goals scored with feet this summer, left-pegged efforts trail right-footed finishes by just one at 23-24. Spain are the fifth World Cup holders to have been deposed at the first hurdle on their defence. The previous four were Italy in 1950 (they had won in 1938 then WWII intervened), Brazil in 1966, France in 2002 and Italy again in 2010. Four years in football is a very long time to fade. Now that Spain are out Chelsea should at last complete the £32 million capture of striker Diego Costa from Atletico Madrid next week. Blues fans will be hoping he doesn't go a bit ‘Torres’ on them and become known as Diego ‘Costa-lot’After all the frontman failed to register a single shot on target during 126 minutes of action in Brazil. Poor: Brazilian-born Diego Costa was a huge disappointment for Spain during their first two World Cup games . For many it would seem France, after their impressive 3-0 win over Honduras, should ease towards the knockout stages against Switzerland. But the Swiss, despite the small size of their nation, should never be underestimated and they have a good record against the French. In previous meetings between the two sides, the Swiss have won 12, France have been victorious in 15 and there have been nine draws. For those not utterly obsessed with football who have a social conscience and concerns about the environment, 16 per cent of the Amazon rainforest, an area larger than Cameroon, has been cut down since Brazil lost a competitive home match. That was a 3-1 defeat to Peru in the Copa America in 1975. Look out for: Cristian Gamboa . Costa Rica's Arsenal striker caught the eye in their opening win over Uruguay and could well be the player to probe the Italian defence on Friday evening. However, the player that could undermine the Italians and stick a knife into England is Cristian Gamboa. Currently with Norwegian club Rosenborg, the right back will no doubt be attracting the attention of La Liga and Premier League clubs. One to watch: Costa Rica right-back Cristian Gamboa will no doubt attract attention from Premier League clubs . World Cup Bet . The battle of the rainforests between Honduras and Ecuador could well be a nervy and perhaps feisty affair. So 3/1 for the draw looks a decent shout. World Cup Moment . Italy have a fantastic World Cup pedigree even if many matches have been tough on the eye. But in 1982 they were involved in one of the all-time greatest games when they overcome a brilliant Brazil side winning late on as Paolo Rossi stabbed home to complete a hat-trick.","World Cup 2014 could be England's worst ever should they lose to Costa Rica .
Three Lions needs Italy to win remaining games and need to defeat Costa Ricans themselves .

"The alleged killers of two British backpackers have been paraded by police and used in a bizarre re-enactment of the crime on a Thai beach. Crowds of onlookers watched as the two Burmese labourers replayed the murders, one holding a dustpan in place of the alleged weapon – a garden hoe. The accused, who have allegedly confessed to the crime, wore white motorcycle helmets and handcuffs for the reconstruction – a common practice in Thai murder cases – on the beach where Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were found bludgeoned to death on September 15. Scroll down for video . Replaying horror: Burmese barman 'Win' (kneeling over actor) shows officers how he and his friend 'Saw' (left in white helmet) beat British backpackers Hannah Witheridge and David Miller to death on the Thai beach . Explain: Displaying little emotion as they stood on the Koh Tao beach where Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were found bludgeoned to death, the men gave officers detailed information of the killings . Identified only by the names ‘Win’ and ‘Saw’, the men were held after it was revealed that their DNA matched samples collected from the victims’ bodies. Members of the British media were also asked to take part in the operation to recreate the scene of the killings on Sairee beach. BBC correspondent Jonah Fisher refused. He tweeted: ‘Bizarrely asked to be David Miller in Thai reconstruction on Koh Tao. Sky News lady took Hannah role.’ The labourers are alleged to have raped Miss Witheridge before killing her. Police chief Somyot Poompanmoung told reporters in Koh Tao that the DNA of the men matched samples found on the deceased. Emotionless: The men (wearing white helmets, left and right) were seen giving officers detailed information of their movements while an actor (pictured on the floor) replayed the events . Grisly: Thai police carry out a 'reconstruction' of the brutal murder, with an actor (pictured lying on sand) playing one of the victims. Win - one of the two men who has reportedly confessed to bludgeoning Hannah Witheridge and David Miller to death - looks on in the background (pictured wearing a white helmet) The authorities also said they had CCTV footage to support their case and Miss Witheridge’s mobile phone was found in the men’s bungalow. DNA taken from cigarette butts of the same L&M brand which were found near the crime scene matched samples found on Miss Witheridge, police added, and Win was caught on CCTV footage buying L&M cigarettes. A third man who was arrested with Win and Saw has been discounted. The police chief said: ‘Tests show that DNA samples of the two Burmese matched the DNA [traces] collected by the police.’ On the night of the murder, the two men were drinking, playing a guitar, smoking and singing on the beach when they saw the two victims kissing, were aroused and decided to get rid of Mr Miller by drowning and beating him before attacking Miss Witheridge, it was reported. Pictured: The two Burmese workers, Saw (left in both images) and Win (right in both images), sit and pray together escroted by a police officer during a press conference on Koh Tao island this morning . Method: Win and Saw (both wearing white helmets) pose for photographs as they show police officers how their victims were struck over the head with a garden hoe . Gathering: The suspects (Win, right and Saw, left - both in white helmets) sit either side of a police officer explaining how the murders were carried out. Win is pictured holding an acoustic guitar . Murdered: The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on Koh Tao on September 15. Autopsies showed that Miss Witheridge died from head wounds while Mr Miller suffered severe blows to the head and drowned in the surf . The pair face allegations of murder, rape and theft, but have not yet been formally charged, the police chief said. The two migrant workers are expected to remain in custody until they are brought to court. Police lieutenant general Decha Butrnamphech said: ‘I am very satisfied with the investigation.’ Two years ago Thai police said they would stop public reconstructions of crimes using alleged perpetrators after complaints that they prejudiced trials – but they resumed after a few months. The reconstruction follows weeks of pressure on police to find the murderers of the British backpackers. There has also been growing criticism over the standard of the investigation, from not sealing off the crime scene quickly enough to letting potential suspects leave the island. Migrant workers, particularly from neighbouring Myanmar, have been used as scapegoats for crimes in Thailand. The rape and murder of 23-year-old Welsh backpacker Kirsty Jones in 2000 was blamed on an ethnic guide from Myanmar who was beaten by police in an attempt to coerce a confession. Despite a number of arrests, no charges have ever been brought over her death. Displayed: The DNA from Saw (left) and Win (right) - who are said to have confessed to murdering two British backpackers in Thailand - matches that collected from the victims' bodies, local police said .

"In the end they only won by two, but the way Chelsea were playing it could have been much worse for West Bromwich Albion. A scintillating opening 30 minutes, during which Diego Costa and Eden Hazard found the net, was all it took for Jose Mourinho’s men to dispatch the visitors. When West Brom midfielder Claudio Yacob saw red shortly after, Chelsea were home and dry. The Portuguese’s attacking blueprint was obvious from the off, but the visitors were powerless to do anything about it. In theory it was a simple exercise — win possession from a West Brom goal-kick, drive forward and pick out Costa, Hazard, Oscar or Willian. Cesc Fabregas was in sublime form at Stamford Bridge recording his 10th league assist of the season . Costa runs away in celebration as Stamford Bridge erupts after his opening strike . Costa got Chelsea on their way to a comfortable three points against West Brom in the Premier League match . Hazard shoots and scores to make it 2-0 at Stamford Bridge against West Brom on Saturday . Mourinho was clearly impressed with his side’s display, but refused to address talk of the Barclays Premier League title already being in the bag. ‘We are playing fantastically but if you don’t get silverware, it is a frustration,’ he said. ‘Do you remember a team that played fantastic football and won nothing? You remember ones that won.’ Chelsea’s first-half performance showed flashes of Pep Guardiola’s all-conquering Barcelona side, and fittingly, it was a former Barca man who made them tick. Cesc Fabregas, who recorded his 10th league assist of the season, was the brains behind the operation. The £30million summer signing pulled the proverbial strings from deep, and with such attacking talent in front of him, he was obviously enjoying himself. Fabregas and Costa were criticised by Sergio Ramos (above) for a lack of commitment to the Spanish side . ‘I don’t think I’m exaggerating if I don’t remember playing and enjoying a match as much as I did in the first half,’ Fabregas said. ‘It was a beautiful performance. We created plenty of chances and had control,’ the Spaniard told Match of the Day. ‘It is difficult after internationals because the team doesn’t have time to work on things but I enjoyed it a lot, particularly the first 45 minutes.’ It was apt that Fabregas mentioned the international break as the club versus country issue again dominated the build-up to a Chelsea fixture. He and Costa withdrew from Spain’s squad for a European Championship qualifier with Belarus and a friendly against Germany, citing hamstring and groin injuries. Jose Mourinho kept Chelsea's unbeaten start to the season intact against West Brom with a 2-0 victory . It prompted Spain defender Sergio Ramos to say he would like players to show the same commitment to the national side as they do their clubs. But Mourinho, Ramos’s old manager at Real Madrid, dismissed the comments. ‘Ramos is a fantastic player, but he is not a doctor,’ said Mourinho. ‘He is not a doctor and I am the same. My doctor and the Spanish national team doctor, they had the scans and decided the player was not in a fit condition to play. I don’t think Sergio did a medicine masters in the last couple of years to understand it.’","Diego Costa and Eden Hazard netted in Chelsea's 2-0 over the Baggies .

"‘When the ball goes into control zone – team must make at least three passes before hitting the CF [centre forward]. ‘Once the ball is played into the end zone – 2 MFs [midfielders] try to get in and support for a 3v2. ‘However, if the defending team win the ball back they counter straight away.’ *This is clearly Gary Neville's training notes and not secret tactical information for the big match against Italy. As big supporters of the England team, there's no way MailOnline Sport would publish details that would harm Roy Hodgson's pursuit of World Cup glory. Gary Neville revealed his coaching crib sheet to photographers in Rio on Wednesday. On one side of the England coach’s notes, you can make out the instructions from a training session. ‘When the ball goes into control zone — team must make at least 3 passes before hitting the CF [centre forward]. ‘Once the ball is played into the end zone — 2 MFs [midfielders] try to get in and support for a 3v2. ‘However, if the defending team win the ball back they counter straight away.’ The scribbles in no way gave away Roy Hodgson’s game plan for the Italy clash. However, they did suggest England are attempting to be primed to protect the ball and value possession in a crowded midfield in the heat of the Amazon.

Quick penetration is very much the style in the Barclays Premier League but it comes with risk. Italy will protect the ball and the last thing Roy Hodgson will want is for his players to spend 90 minutes chasing the ball in Manaus, where the humidity will be crippling. ‘Two midfielders in support’ hints at an England midfield three, which would match Italy’s central trio of Pirlo, Verratti and De Rossi, because Hodgson would not encourage two to chase on and support in attack if they were  only a midfield pair. That would leave no anchorman. ‘Counter attack’ will be the order to drop in and regroup quickly, because almost every team will seek to destroy with a swift break at the turnover of possession. Neville later tweeted: 'My curtains have been closed permanently for the duration of this tournament!

"The sighting of a Syrian opposition flag in a 2001 episode of The Simpsons is proof the United States is behind the country's civil war, an Egyptian television channel has claimed. A report on Al-Tahrir TV featured an episode of the Fox show called New Kids On The Blecch which originally aired more than 13 years ago. It shows a boy band that includes Bart Simpson and his friends dropping bombs on men in Arabic attire in a music video. One of the trucks blown up has an image of the Syrian revolutionary flag on the side. Conspiracy? An Egyptian TV channel claims the presence of this Syrian opposition flag (circled) in a 2001 episode of The Simpsons proves the United States is behind the uprising in the country . 'Arousing a debate': The anchor for Al-Tahrir TV claims the flag proves there is a conspiracy because it appeared some nine years before 'there was such a thing called the Syrian opposition' Before showing the video, Al-Tahrir's anchor says the flag's depiction was proof that the Arab Spring revolutions - which has seen uprisings in countries such as Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen as well as Syria - was part of a global conspiracy by America. She claims: 'The video you are about to see shows animated figures dancing, flying airplanes and dropping bombs on what must be Syria because there are other animated figures below in Arab garb and the Syrian [opposition] flag appears on one of the vehicles. 'Let's take a look at the video, which suggests that what is happening in Syria today was premeditated. She says it was not known how the flag made it into the episode, adding that it had 'aroused a debate' on social media, it was reported by Israel National News.

After showing the clip, the anchor says: 'The flag appeared... before there was such a thing called the 'Syrian opposition'. 'That’s why people are saying on Facebook that this is a conspiracy.' The report, which aired on Al-Tahrir TV on Sunday, was posted to the internet by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI).

"Roger Federer finally appeared on court in Lille  in a major boost for Switzerland ahead of their Davis Cup final against France starting Friday. Federer hadn't trained since his withdraw from Sunday's ATP World Tour Finals in London, where he told the crowd he wasn't 'match fit' to take on Novak Djokovic. The world No 2 was unable to recover from his epic three-set semi-final win against his Swiss team-mate Stanislas Wawrinka the night before in which he saved four match points before claiming victory in a tie-break. Roger Federer hits the court in Lille where Switzerland will take on France in the Davis Cup final . Federer hadn't hit a ball since his semi-final victory over fellow Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka in London . But the 17-time major winner, for whom the Davis Cup title is a notable absentee on his long list of achievements, was well enough to hit-up for  the first time since then on the clay courts of the Pierre-Mauroy de Villeneuve-d'Ascq stadium. Federer appeared in good spirits, smiling throughout a hit-up which lasted about 30 minutes with the Swiss No 4 Michael Lammer after forgoing an earlier designated slot in the early afternoon. Wawrinka and the remainder of the Swiss team trained for about two hours in the afternoon with team coach Ivo Warner and captain Severin Luthi.

"A megachurch pastor who called women 'penis homes' has resigned amid allegations of bullying and corruption. Mark Driscoll, stepped down from his position as elder and lead pastor at Mars Hill, Seattle, after a group of church elders recently ended an investigation into a series of formal charges brought against him. Announcing the decision on the church's website on Wednesday, he said: 'It would be best for the health of our family, and for the Mars Hill family, that we step aside from further ministry at the church.' Mark Driscoll, pictured in 2007, resigned from his position as lead pastor after allegations of bullying . Driscoll, whose church grew to attract more than 12,000 at branches across five states, took a leave of absence in August so church leaders could investigate whether he was fit to lead after accusations that he bullied members, threatened opponents, lied and oversaw mismanagement of church funds, the Seattle Times reported. But the church's board said on its website that Driscoll was not asked to resign, and they were surprised to receive his resignation. His resignation letter, which was obtained by Religion News Service, said: 'Recent months have proven unhealthy for our family -- even physically unsafe at times -- and we believe the time has now come for the elders to choose new pastoral leadership for Mars Hill. 'There are many things I have confessed and repented of, privately and publicly, as you are well aware. Specifically, I have confessed to past pride, anger and a domineering spirit.' Domineering spirit: Pastor Mark Driscoll wrote that women were created to give homes to men's penises . The board Driscoll has been 'guilty of arrogance, responding to conflict with a quick temper and harsh speech, and leading the staff and elders in a domineering manner.' The board said that while it believes Driscoll needs to address those areas in his life, 'we do not believe him to be disqualified from pastoral ministry.' The church noted that Driscoll, the only pastor it has known since it was founded 18 years ago, was never charged with immorality, illegality or heresy. It said most of the charges involved the domineering style of leadership, and that they found some accusations 'unfair or untrue.' Driscoll founded his megachurch, 18 years ago. It has branches across five states but some have been forced to close last month . A phone and email message left with the church was not immediately returned Wednesday afternoon. Other charges had previously been addressed by Driscoll, the church noted. In 2001, under a pseudonym, William Wallace II, Mark Driscoll wrote: . 'The first thing to know about your penis is, that despite the way it may see, it is not your penis. Ultimately, God created you and it is his penis. You are simply borrowing it for a while. 'While His penis is on loan you must admit that it is sort of just hanging out there very lonely as if it needed a home, sort of like a man wondering the streets looking for a house to live in. 'Knowing that His penis would need a home, God created a woman to be your wife and when you marry her and look down you will notice that your wife is shaped differently than you and makes a very nice home. 'Therefore, if you are single you must remember that your penis is homeless and needs a home. Though you may believe your hand is shaped like a home, it is not,' he wrote. 'And, though women other than your wife may look like a home, to rest there would be breaking into another man's home.' The best-selling author has been accused of plagiarism and criticized for his stance against homosexuality and female preachers. In July, Driscoll apologized for crude comments he made posting under an alias in an online discussion forum in 2000. And last month, his church was forced to close several of its branches after comments Driscoll made calling women 'penis homes' emerged online. Since 1996, the church has grown quickly to attract thousands of followers in 15 branches in five states. Last month, the church announced it was closing some of its branches and making plans to lay off dozens of employees. The Seattle Times reported that financial problems in the wake of falling attendance forced the cutbacks. Combined attendance at all Mars Hill branches had dropped from more than 12,000 a week at the start of the year to less than 9,000, a church spokesman said last month. The board now is planning for the future. 'We would ask for patience as we now make plans for the first transition of pastoral leadership in the history of Mars Hill Church,' the church's board said on its website.","Mark Driscoll, 43, is the founder of Mars Hill, an evangelical megachurch with branches across five states .

"Brain dead: Jahi McMath was declared brain dead on Dec. 12 after she went into cardiac arrest following surgery to treat sleep apnea . The case of the 13-year-old girl declared brain dead does not seem to be coming to a close any time soon, with experts still disagreeing nearly 10 months after a coroner declared her dead. Paul Fisher, a Stanford University pediatric neurologist, told a California judge Monday that he sees no evidence that Jahi McMath is alive 10 months after a coroner signed her death certificate. Jahi was declared brain dead on Dec. 12 after she went into cardiac arrest following surgery to treat sleep apnea. Fisher dismissed videos showing the girl moving her hands and feet at her mother's command. Her family wants Alameda County Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo to issue what would be an unprecedented order declaring her to be alive after being declared brain dead. A hearing had been scheduled for Thursday, but it has been postponed as the attorney representing McMath's mother seeks time to respond to Fisher's finding. 'There wasn't time to react to this letter,' attorney Chris Dolan said Wednesday night. 'Given the fact that we were up against the time crunch ... I thought that we were going to be in essence sandbagged.' Dolan objected to Fisher's appointment as an independent expert, arguing that the doctor has a conflict of interest because he was one of the physicians who agreed with the brain-death diagnosis in December. Thursday's hearing wasn't immediately rescheduled, and Dolan has asked for a four-week delay so his experts and Fisher can discuss the results and come up with a plan for more tests that would satisfy them all. Scroll down for video . No evidence: Paul Fisher, a Stanford University pediatric neurologist, told a California judge Monday that he sees no evidence that Jahi McMath is alive 10 months after a coroner signed her death certificate . 'I just wanted to give these doctors a chance to talk,' Dolan said. Five other medical professionals who performed new tests on the teenager in New Jersey last month said the girl showed signs of brain function. In his letter to the judge, Fisher replied that the tests either were irrelevant to determining brain death in a child or not carried out in accordance with accepted medical standards. 'None of the declarations provide evidence that Jahi McMath is not brain dead,' he wrote. Jahi has been kept on a ventilator and feeding tubes since she suffered severe complications from the surgery. Fisher examined her then at the request of the judge while her family fought a hospital's decision to remove the equipment. Fisher was one of three doctors who declared her brain-dead after finding no neurological activity. Mother: Jahi's mother, Latasha Winkfield, has worked to keep her daughter's organs functioning on life support, first at Children's Hospital in Oakland and later at an undisclosed medical facility, and now a house in New Jersey . Dismissed: Fisher dismissed videos showing the girl moving her hands and feet at her mother's command . Dolan has given the judge the results of a Sept. 1 electroencephalogram that a researcher at a medical school in Cuba said showed electrical activity in Jahi's brain. Fisher, in his letter to the judge, said the new test was performed in an apartment, not a health care setting, and the recorded activity could have come from elsewhere in the girl's body or even the environment. Regardless, he said, a flat reading on the exam is not a prerequisite for brain death. Fisher similarly took issue with the brain scan that allegedly showed blood flowing to Jahi's brain. He said the test doctors and researchers from the nonprofit International Brain Research Foundation used was incorrect and would not have demonstrated such blood flow. Tests: Five medical professionals who performed new tests on the teenager in New Jersey last month said the girl showed signs of brain function . Jahi's mother, Latasha Winkfield, has worked to keep her daughter's organs functioning on life support, first at Children's Hospital in Oakland and later at an undisclosed medical facility, and now a house in New Jersey. Unlike California, New Jersey law allows families to reject a declaration of brain death on religious grounds and allows brain-dead patients to remain connected to ventilators.","Paul Fisher, a Stanford University pediatric neurologist, told a California judge Monday that he sees no evidence that Jahi McMath is alive .

"If Liverpool were to continue in their current vein of form for the remainder of the season, they might only just avoid relegation. Brendan Rodgers' side have averaged just 1.16 points per game in the 2014-15 Premier League, which puts them on course to earn 44 points. That kind of tally would have put them just 11 points outside the drop zone last season, and eight outside it the year before. Steven Gerrard and Liverpool have averaged just 1.16 points per game in the current Premier League season . Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool side have lost their last four games in all competitions . However, given that 40 points is seen as the 'magic' marker for team down the bottom, it could be more uncomfortable for Rodgers' men if they don't buck up their ideas.Â . If Liverpool are hoping to make the top four again this campaign, they need to win roughly 2.5 points per game for the rest of the season - a feat they didn't even manage last year when they had the free-scoring Luis Suarez. Similarly, Arsenal could be set for their first mid-table finish since 1995 if performances don't improve. The Gunners' current points per game rate is 1.41, which would give them a total of 53.5. That figure would have earned them ninth place last season. If Arsenal's form were to continue as it was they would finish ninth based on last season's points totals . Arsenal have had some reasonable patches this season but have failed to turn that into points . Arsene Wenger's side might need to win roughly 2.3 points per game if they want their customary Champions League spot. One team that can afford to be pleased with their performances, though, is Chelsea. Jose Mourinho's side are currently picking up a staggering 2.6 points per game.Â . If they carry on at that rate they will end the season on 98.8 points, which would break the current Premier League record. Even if Manchester City were to win as many points as they did last year (86), at this rate Chelsea would still be champions by Easter.

"Harry Redknapp is still searching for a number of players to improve QPR's chances of Premier League survival but insists keeping Loic Remy would feel like a new signing. Signed from Marseille in January 2013, Remy proved an instant hit with the club's fans but could not prevent the Hoops from slipping to relegation. Having spent last season on loan at Newcastle while QPR battled back into the top flight through the play-offs, Remy's long-term future appeared to be away from Loftus Road, but a summer move to Liverpool collapsed. Now the France forward is preparing to start the new campaign at Rangers, with Redknapp impressed by his application since rejoining his team-mates. Transfer: Harry Redknapp said persuading Loic Remy to stay at QPR would be like a new signing . Second spell: Loic Remy was a hit at QPR when he first signed for the club, but couldn't stop them going down . 'I'm hoping Loic Remy stays,' the 67-year-old said in his 666Bet blog. 'It will be like a new signing if he does. His attitude has been fantastic since he has come back, so we will have no problem welcoming him back into the side. 'If he is going to go, we need to know as soon as we can so we can get a replacement in.' So far Redknapp has looked to add experience and competition to his defensive ranks with Rio Ferdinand, Steven Caulker and Mauricio Isla all coming in, the latter on loan from Juventus, with midfielder Jordon Mutch also signed from Cardiff. Although the former West Ham, Tottenham and Portsmouth boss is keen to add numbers to his squad before the transfer window closes, Redknapp knows there are limitations on what the club can spend. Money: The QPR manager said he wants to sing more players but understands the financial contraints . 'We're still short, certainly need another three or four players,' he said. 'The chairman (Tony Fernandes) is working hard at getting the right players in, but these things take time. We can only spend what we can spend, so it's certainly not easy.' Redknapp confirmed Adel Taarabt is likely to depart in the coming weeks, with Holland international midfied duo Leroy Fer and Jonathan De Guzman linked with moves to the west London club. After replacing Mark Hughes at QPR in November 2012, Redknapp was unable to keep the R's in the Premier League but, with a much-changed squad, that is his main goal this time around. Signing: Rio Ferdinand has joined QPR from Manchester United and could partner Steven Caulker in defence . 'If we can stay-up I'd be delighted,' he added. 'If you offered me fourth from bottom now, I'd bite your hand off. I could talk cobblers and say we want to finish in the top half. 'But just to stay in the Premier League would be great for us - consolidate and keep building. We have been a yo-yo club for too long, we just need to become an established Premier League club.'

"They bossed England at Wembley and finished just four points behind Argentina in qualifying, yet still Chile rank as World Cup outsiders ahead of their opener with Australia. It is, no doubt, their Group B residence alongside champions Spain and 2010 runners-up Holland – not to mention a probable second-round meeting with Brazil – which sees the South Americans installed as 40/1 shots. But Chile could yet prove the brightest of all the dark horses at the tournament and a convincing victory against a weak Australia could well see those odds slashed. Centre of attention: Alexis Sanchez is the star man for Chile... and he has a superb supporting cast . It was back in November that Jorge Sampaoli’s side were 2-0 victors over England as they put on a performance which married style, strength and, admirably, a cunning cynicism. They have since held Spain to a 2-2 draw and won plaudits following a 1-0 defeat to Germany and the feeling is they boast all of the ingredients to emerge as the sexy second team of World Cup followers. Here, Sportsmail runs you through the five Chileans who could star over the next four weeks… . Alexis Sanchez (25 years old, 67 caps/22 goals) He was a 21-year-old wonderkid in South Africa who dazzled with his quick feet and even quicker turn of toe. Four years on he has matured into a goalscoring talisman, evidenced by his 19 La Liga strikes for Barcelona last season and his brace in that win at Wembley. Now deployed in a central role rather than out wide, the pressure will be on Sanchez to add to his 22 international goals over the course of the next fortnight – we’re confident he can shoulder such burden. Two good: Sanchez scored both goals when Chile beat England at Wembley last November . Arturo Vidal (27 years old, 54 caps/8 goals) The Juventus schemer is one of the most respected midfielders in European football at present, a player whose game knows no weakness and one who can score goals as well as defend them. Vidal has the potential to emerge as one of the stars of the tournament and will no doubt be the subject of renewed interest from the Premier League and La Liga. He could, however, miss the opener against Australia because of a knee injury. Middle man: Arturo Vidal pulls the strings for Chile and is a set-piece specialist . Stylish: Vidal has one of the more interesting haircuts on display at the World Cup . Eduardo Vargas (24 years old, 30 caps/14 goals) His European club career is yet to truly ignite following an £11.5million move to Napoli in 2012 – he spent the second half of last season on loan at Valencia – but on the international stage Vargas is right at home. His return of 14 goals from 30 outings speaks for itself and the pacey, skilful frontman could capitalise if opposition defences become preoccupied by comrade Sanchez. Game for a laugh: Eduardo Vargas (left), Mauricio Pinilla and Carlos Carmona (right) joke around in training . Charles Aranguiz (25 years old, 21 caps/2 goals) The midfielder is likely to raid the penalty area in search of goals but is equally adept at laying them on for team-mates. Sampaoli knows him well from the Chilean youth ranks and the Udinese man is one of the coach’s most trusted lieutenants. Big-time Charlie? Chile midfielder Charles Aranguiz trains ahead of his side's opener against Australia . Felipe Gutierrez (23 years old, 18 caps/1 goal) The injury to Vidal should see the FC Twente midfielder handed his chance to shine. He is slight of build but laden with skill and has the experience of two years in the Eredivisie. Gutierrez was praised by team-mate Marcelo Diaz this week and there is a feeling he could be the wildcard in Chile’s pack. Thrown in at the deep end: Felipe Gutierrez and his Chile team-mates face the mighty Spain and Holland . The man in charge: Chile boss Jorge Sampaoli will attempt to steer his side out of the tricky Group B .","Chile start their campaign against Australia on Friday night .

"Two soldiers who were wounded in Afghanistan are retracing Ernest Shackleton's Antarctic rescue mission after almost 100 years. They are part of a four-man team who are flying out to Argentina today to begin what promises to be a gruelling five-week trek across one of the most inhospitable wildernesses in the world. The mission was inspired by Shackleton, who famously saved the crew of his ship Endurance more than a year after it became trapped in pack ice and sank. Big shoes to fill: From left, David Hempleman-Adams, Ollie Bainbridge, Keith Harbridge and Justin Packshaw fly out today to re-enact Ernest Shackleton's  Antarctic rescue mission - 98 years after the famous explorer . Following in his footsteps: The Endurance mission (left) led by Ernest Shackleton (right) ended in a long rescue . The men, who are fundraising for a £300million military rehabilitation centre, will retrace the famous  mission Shackleton made from Elephant Island to South Georgia in a 22ft boat and back again in a rescue ship. Led by David Hempleman-Adams, one of the world's most experienced explorers, and former Captain in the Royal Dragoon Guards Justin Packshaw, the team will spend five weeks on the mission. Enduring freezing temperatures, they will first retrace Shackleton's journey from Elephant Island to South Georgia, before trekking across mountains to the former Grytviken whaling station where he found help - a journey of almost 1,000 miles in total. Thankfully they will have many more modern conveniences than Shackleton and his men - including crampons and the latest in exploring technology - but the trip is not without its dangers. One of the explorers is 26-year-old Corporal Ollie Bainbridge, who was awarded the Military Cross for 'a display of personal courage, selfless commitment and inspired leadership' in Afghanistan. The soldier was driving an armoured Jackal vehicle on his second tour of duty to the country when it hit a roadside bomb, leading to a fierce firefight. He stayed cool under pressure, dragging a colleague to safety and making sure the injured were evacuated. Ready to go: The team make the final preparations at London's Hyde Park Barracks with their equipment . Trapped: The Endurance was stuck in pack ice for months before it sank, leaving its crew to fight for survival . But the next month, he was fighting insurgents when he was blown up by a grenade, shattering his elbow and hitting his leg with shrapnel. Joining the serving soldier is Lance Corporal Keith Harbridge, whose ear was injured in a grenade attack in Afghanistan in 2010. Despite having long-term problems he has returned to the Royal Dragoon Guards and is still playing an active part in the Army - managing to go skydiving and caving in his spare time. He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I get vertigo when I’m climbing now and I can’t run as fast as I used to. 'I’m sure those things will slow me down. My main worry is that I will become a burden.' Just as the First World War was breaking out in August 1914, the Endurance's crew set out from London with the lofty ambition of becoming the first to cross the Antarctic continent. In January 1915 the ship became trapped in pack ice and began drifting, its crew unable to do anything except hope it would become unstuck. Once the ship (left) went down, Shackleton travelled almost 1,000 miles to the Grytviken whaling station (right) Hard graft: The men pulled their remaining 22ft boat - fortunately the new expedition will have better equipment . They remained by the ship for most of the year until finally, in November 1915, it sank beneath the ice. That left the exposed crew to march across the inhospitable Antarctic ice, setting up camps in freezing conditions in their bid to be rescued. By March 1916, the crew had shot the last of their original team of 69 dogs and eaten the youngest ones. The next month, when the crew were camped on Elephant Island, Shackleton announced he was doing what most would have thought impossible - vowing to sail a boat just 22ft long more than 800 miles to South Georgia. Once he arrived he and two others trekked over glacier-covered mountains to fetch help from the whaling station, which sparked the eventual rescue mission. All the crew survived. The re-enactment is in aid of the Duke of Westminster's Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre (DNRC) at Stanford Hall, near Loughborough, which is due to open in 2018 and cost £300million. Poignant: The images of the Endurance stuck in Antarctic ice have become a symbol of perseverence . It will replace the current national centre in Headley Court in Surrey, which the Ministry of Defence says is out of date. It is backed by Prince William, who said: 'It is very inspiring that 100 years on wounded soldiers are following in the footsteps of Sir Ernest Shackleton's daring rescue from Elephant Island to South Georgia. 'In doing so they will be displaying the same perseverance in adversity that characterised Shackleton's 1914 Endurance expedition and which we see today in those members of the armed forces who are fighting their way back from serious injury.'

"Colin Scotts was the biggest Australian name in NFL for many years and says rugby league star Jarryd Hayne has 'zero point one chance of making it but yes he can make it'. And if he does, the former Arizona Cardinals defensive end believes Hayne can look forward to a $US3million annual salary. 'Are the odds against him, yes they are. Is it going to be difficult, yes, but if anyone can a super athlete like him can,' Scotts said. Scroll down for video . Colin Scotts is the first ever Australian to find great success in American Football ranks. Opportunity came knocking when he was spotted by NFL scouts playing rugby for the Australian Schoolboys side in 1981 . 'He (Jarryd Hayne) is an inspiration, we should support him because what he's trying to do takes big balls,' says Colin Scotts . 'He's walking into the most intense complex explosive game anywhere in the world at the age of 27 but I just think this country needs more people that decide life starts when you get out of your comfort zone,' the former NFL star added. 'He's an inspiration, we should support him because what he's trying to do takes big balls. 'Can he do it? Yes he can, you gotta believe, you know.' Australian athletes have transitioned from AFL to American Football, from soccer and rugby union to NFL and even track and field - but never from rugby league to NFL. Hayne would be blazing a trail not unlike Scotts, who became the first local rugby union player to make the transition. Scotts now spends much of his time on the public speaking circuit - but still has personal and business interests in American Football -  he says special teams would suit the former Parramatta player. Colin Scotts was offered a scholarship to play college football and would go onto the NFL with the Arizona Cardinals. Scotts played five years of college football and five years as a professional . Colin Scotts says Jarryd Hayne faces two big challenges. Firstly, dealing with the American psyche who will see him as potentially taking a position away from one of the locals and secondly, being able to play on synthetic surfaces . 'They would have him straight away, like punt return, keep it simple for him,' he said. 'And he'd be great at it and then possibly a fullback position that blocks for the running back or even a running back, but he's gonna have to be quick because they're all like him over there.' Scotts has urged Hayne to find out everything he can and learn from those who have blazed the trail before him. His two biggest challenges, he insists, are dealing with the American psyche who will see him as potentially taking a position away from one of the locals and training on synthetic grass. 'As an outsider, I had to earn it and fight for acceptance by some who thought I'd stolen a place meant for an American,' he said. 'That's always going to be there, at the end of the day if he earns that respect as I did, it's a long road with that respect. 'And preparing himself for the different surface of synthetic grass, he should be talking to me number one, I know a lot about both issues and I'm here to help. 'He (Jarryd Hayne) can earn 2 to 3 million a year American, easily. Yes it's zero point 1 chance of happening, the guy's nearly 27 but I think the guy is the most humble bloke, has a good head on his shoulders and a lot of things going for him' says Colin Scotts . Scotts, pictured with the Cardinals in 1987. The Australian is wearing a number 69 jersey (third from the right in the second last row) 'He's got to get as much knowledge about what he is trying to do and that's about the athletic application and study of the game, he needs leads for the teams, has he got somewhere to go. 'This is a superstar of Australian sport migrating over to my sport, if I can help I will be happy to. I will enjoy watching this. 'Life starts at the end of your comfort zone and being afraid of not having a go and Australia needs to get behind him and it's inspirational for all of us to hear this. 'He can earn 2 to 3 million a year American, easily. Yes it's zero point 1 chance of happening, the guy's nearly 27 but I think the guy is the most humble bloke, has a good head on his shoulders and a lot of things going for him. 'He's certainly got a beautiful confidence, he's a beautiful athlete and he's one of our greatest athletes, has beautiful balance, good hands and stocky legs and calmness when he does his stuff. 'Put it this way, he is playing a level above everybody else here so why not go and chase it?' Scotts, was the first Australian to win an American Football scholarship to play the game in the US with the Arizona Cardinals. He was spotted playing rugby for the Australian Schoolboys side in 1981 and his life changed forever. He went on to success as defensive end for the University of Hawaii, the St Louis Cardinals, the Arizona Cardinals and the Houston Oilers. He played five years of college football and five years as a professional. Colin Ridgeway (Dallas) 1965 . Colin Scotts (Arizona Cardinals) 1987 . Darren Bennett (San Diego) 1995 .

On the Celebrity Speakers website they describe his breakthrough as an achievement which 'catapulted him into the world of professional American sport where he thrived for the next four years until, playing for the Houston Oilers, a freak injury taught him why the NFL is known as the Not For Long League'. 'Colin stayed on in the States, living the high life, taking on the world as a pro-wrestler, becoming a successful businessman in the area of natural gas, telecommunications, and home health care, before returning to Sydney for the Olympics.' While Colin Scotts and the likes of Jesse Williams (Australia's first ever Super Bowl winner) of the Seattle Seahawks have battled through the college system and in the line of scrimmage, most success for Australians making the transition has been via AFL and into a punting role. Darren Bennett played 159 games and can also lay claim to being among the most successful of the Aussies, having enjoyed a decorated career in San Diego Chargers colours. The Rocca brothers, Sav and Anthony both followed him into roles as a kicker, Sav making a mark as the oldest rookie to play the game professionally in the US. 'Strong minds and brave hearts, let's not just sit around and not have a go or knock people who are having a go,' Colin Scotts said. 'If Jarryd was to make it, whether on special teams or otherwise, wow it'd be some achievement.' Jesse Williams is the only Australian to ever win a Super Bowl ring after success last season with the Seattle Seahawks. He's currently on the sidelines with a knee injury .

"Succumbing in agony to a deadly toxin coursing through its veins, a bull elephant falls to its knees after being shot by a poacher's poisoned arrow. The bull was attacked  as he roamed the savannah of Tsavo National Park in Kenya by ruthless hunters hoping to tear out his tusks and sell them on the lucrative ivory black market. But happily his life was spared after a team of heroic vets flew in just in time to remove the arrow and administer vital drugs to counter the poison after he was spotted writhing on the ground. Had the team of medics not arrived when they did, the majestic beast would have died a long and painful death, becoming yet another victim of an illegal trade that is responsible for the death of one elephant every 15 minutes in Africa. Scroll down for video . Brought to his knees: The elephant had succumbed to the poison arrow which poachers had fired into his hind leg . To the rescue: But medics from the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust and the Kenya Wildlife Service found the stricken  bull, Tsavo National Park, just in time . Race against time: It was a race against time for the medics as they battled to remove the arrow and clean the wound before it was too late . Vets from the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust  and the Kenya Wildlife Service treated the bull quickly giving him long acting antibiotics to ensure that the elephant would make a full recovery. Rob Brandford, director of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, said that the animal would certainly have died were it not for the amazing efforts of the emergency team. He said: 'In this case the tusker has a clearly visible wound on his back leg and the vets needed to ensure they acted quickly before the poison spread. Huge efforts: Rob Brandford (not pictured), director of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, said that the animal would certainly have died were it not for the amazing efforts of the emergency team . Steady hand: Once the deadly arrow was removed and the wound was cleaned, the team administered long acting antibiotics to ensure that the elephant would make a full recovery . 'For other elephants however that aren't treated in time, death by poisoned arrow can be horrendous and extremely painful. Poachers in Africa are killing elephants at a rate of one every 15 minutes, say experts, fuelling the ruthless illegal ivory trade that is threatening to wipe out the species from the face of the Earth. Up to 35,000 of the estimated 500,000 African elephants are slaughtered every year for their tusks, their carcasses discarded like hair clippings on a barbershop floor. A single male elephant's two tusks can weigh more than 250 pounds, with a pound of ivory fetching as much as $1,500 on the black market. It means this elephant's tusks could have fetched up to $400,000. Poachers traditionally target  the largest breeding males and the oldest females, who lead the elephant troops, reducing elephant populations to leaderless groups of traumatized orphans huddling together. But as populations diminish, poachers are turning on the youngsters too, even poisoning watering holes with cyanide to save time and energy. Poachers usually come from criminal gangs or terror groups such as Al-Shabab, the Somalia-based wing of al Qaida, which raises $600,000 a month from poaching to fund its activities. The ivory is so valuable because all across Asia — particularly in China — ivory figurines are given as traditional gifts, and ivory chopsticks, hair ornaments, and jewelry are highly prized luxuries. In some areas, people even believe ivory has magical healing powers and is ground down into a powder and used to treat a range of ailments - at a very high cost. Poachers traditionally target  the largest breeding males and the oldest females, who lead the elephant troops and have the largest tusks, reducing elephant populations to leaderless groups of traumatized orphans huddling together.

In some areas, people even believe ivory has magical healing powers and is ground down into a powder and used to treat a range of ailments - at a very high cost. But while this elephant survived the horrific attack, which happened on September 15, Brandford admits that poaching remains a huge issue in Africa with poachers using a variety of methods to slaughter one of the planet's most iconic beasts. He said: 'Across Africa, poaching is an extremely worrying problem that is threatening wild populations, and killing one elephant every 15 minutes for its tusks. 'Sadly the use of poisoned arrows is just one cruel means of death favoured by poachers - snares, automatic weapons and spears are also used. Demand from Far Eastern countries, including China, is driving this slaughter which could see Africa's elephants wiped out within our lifetime.' However, he says that The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust is making a significant difference in the fight against the illegal ivory trade. He said: 'To date, the [our] Anti-Poaching Teams have made over 2,000 arrests and recovered over 130,000 snares, and are aided in the air by our Aerial Surveillance. 'Together with our Mobile Vet Teams (in partnership with Kenya Wildlife Service), it means we can act quickly to any illegal activity and come to the aid of targeted elephants.' Poachers are now slaughtering up to 35,000 of the estimated 500,000 African elephants every year for their tusks. A single male elephant's two tusks can weigh more than 250 pounds, with a pound of ivory fetching as much as $1,500 on the black market. It means this elephant's tusks could have fetched up to $400,000. On his feet: Thankfully, their treatment worked and, after a while, the elephant managed to get to his feet .

"America is known as having one of the strongest economies in the world but that doesn't necessarily mean that quality of life of its citizens is also superior. A study recently published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) measures well-being in the U.S. based on nine different factors. Based on the OECD’s study, how’s Life in Your Region? Measuring Regional and Local Well-being for Policy Making,' 24/7 Wall St. identified the 10 states with the worst quality of life and Mississippi and Alabama were among them. Mississippi: Mississippi is the state with the worst quality of life rating according to a study measuring nine different standards such as employment rates and education . Alabama: Alabama has a high poverty rate with 19 per cent of the population living below the poverty line . 1. Mississippi .

The data isn't based on residents' opinion of well-being or being safe rather it's based on numbers. Yahoo reports that in order to calculate health, the OECD measured mortality rates as opposed to asking them if they felt well. Safety was measured on homicide rates as opposed to asking people whether or not they felt safe. Additional data on state GDP comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) as measured in 2013. The state with the worst quality of life according to the data is Mississippi. Arkansas: Per capita household disposable income was less than $25,000 last year, nearly the lowest in the nation in the state of Arkansas . West Virginia: The mortality rate was 10.5 deaths per 1,000 people, a higher rate than in all but two other states . Despite having a large state voting rate Mississippi ranks poorly in the defining factors for quality of life. Yahoo reports that less than 82 per cent of workers from Mississippi completed high school in 2013. Mississippi also has some of the highest unemployment rates in the country due to the lack of education. Unemployment leads to poverty and 24 per cent of people from Mississippi suffered from poverty in 2013 which is the highest nationwide. Crime is also a problem in the state with 7.3 murders per 100,000 residents giving them the second highest homicide rate in the county. Alabama is the second state rated as having the worst quality of life. Tennessee: Just 85% of Tennessee workers had completed at least high school as of last year, worse than in many states and residents also had poor access to high speed internet . According to the study's data only 56 per cent of their population had access to services like broadband internet last year. Alabama residents also suffered from one of the highest poverty rates with 19 per cent of their population living in poverty in 2013. Arkansas is the third state on the list, and like the others has extraordinarily high poverty rates. The household income per capita was just $25,000 per year making it one of the lowest in the nation. West Virginia is ranked number four among the states with the worst quality of life. The health rate is very poor with a mortality rate of 10.5 deaths per 1,000 people . Also 19 per cent of their population lived in poverty last year above the national average of 15.8 per cent. Oklahoma: Less than 53% of eligible Oklahomans voted last year, worse than in all but two other states . Tennessee ranks number five for states with the worst quality of life. They had one of the lowest voter turnouts in the nation with just 55.7 per cent. They also had low access to services like broadband internet and only 85 per cent of Tennessee workers completed high school. Oklahoma is number six on the list of American states with the worst quality of life. Only 60 per cent of the state has access to high speed internet and less than 53 per cent of residents voted last year making them one of the states with the lowest level of single engagement. South Carolina is the seventh worst state on the list for poor quality of life. They are one of the poorest states with households just making $25,000 per year. South Carolina: Households had $25,055 in disposable income per capita last year, among the lowest income levels nationwide . Louisiana: There were nearly 11 murders per 100,000 people in the state in 2013, the highest homicide rate nationwide and in the worst 10% of all OECD regions . There are also high unemployment rates with an unemployment rate greater than 9 per cent. Louisiana is the eight worst state to live in according to Wall St. 24/7. A resident in Louisiana is not expected to live past 76-years-old. Louisiana also has some dangerous communities. There were 11 murders per 100,000 people in 2013 making it the highest homicide rate nationwide. New Mexico has the ninth worst quality of life compared to the other U.S. states. The population is a low 2 million people because much of the land is uninhabitable. The residents also have low access to services. Only 54 per cent of households had broadband internet last year. Nearly 21 per cent of the state lives in poverty with households making just $25,000 per year. Georgia was ranked the tenth worst state for quality of life. More than 9 per cent of adults were unemployed last year due to their poor educational attainment rates. Less than 85 per cent of their work force had a high school diploma in 2013. Also 19 per cent of the state's population lives below the poverty line. New Mexico: Nearly 21% of the population lived in poverty that year, second only to Mississippi . Georgia: Less than 85% of Georgia's workforce had at least a high school diploma in 2013, among the lowest rates in the country .","A study recently published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) measures well-being in the U.S.

The move, by VisitBritain, will see famous sites such as Buckingham Palace and Big Ben, in London, Chatsworth House, in Derbyshire, and Stonehenge, in Wiltshire, adopting Mandarin titles. The national tourism agency, which will carry out the marketing push in Asia, believes the initiative will give Chinese greater affinity with Britain and encourage them to pick the UK as a holiday destination. In a bid to attract more tourists from Asia, British landmarks such as Buckingham Palace could be renamed . Stonehenge in Wilsthire could have a Chinese name under the move by VisitBritain . The agency will carry out the drive on social media. It comes as VisitBritain's annual report reveals 20 million people visited the UK between January and July - a seven per cent increase on last year, and a new record - and spent £11.3bn, according to the Telegraph. Christopher Rodrigues, chairman of VisitBritain, said the record figures were 'a tribute to the industry', and forecast tourism to grow six per cent a year until 2020. Their research showed the country's heritage is a key selling point in the Chinese market. Visitors from China have doubled in the last five years and tourism bosses hope they will treble again by 2020 . From a list of 18 iconic tourism attractions or experiences available around the country, the top-three among Chinese respondents were visiting Buckingham Palace, touring the 16th-century historic Chatsworth House and gardens, and visiting Edinburgh Castle, which was joint third with viewing London from the Shard or London Eye. The agency's GREAT China Welcome programme aims to make Britain the destination of choice for the rapidly-growing Chinese market. Visitors from China have doubled in the last five years and tourism bosses hope they will treble again by 2020. Edinburgh Castle: Research showed that the country's heritage is a key selling point in the Chinese market . Touring 16th-century historic Chatsworth House is on the list for Chinese tourists . At the centre of the programme is a new GREAT China Welcome Charter to help Chinese visitors easily identify hotels, attractions, retailers and tour operators that are making themselves ‘China-ready’ by providing information in Mandarin or Cantonese and adapting their products for the Chinese market and culture. VisitBritain's tourism campaign, which began with the Olympics in 2012, has since generated an extra £1.8bn for the economy. Alongside targeting Asia, the agency is also preparing a three-year £3m 'Countryside is GREAT' campaign to showcase British regions.","Government says Mandarin names give Chinese greater affinity to the UK .

"Spanish newspaper Marca has torn into the national side following their 5-1 defeat to Holland, running a predominantly black front page with the blunt headline: ‘FIX THIS’. The paper also highlights the role Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie played in Holland’s brilliant dismantling of the reigning world and European champions, as future Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal’s side struck four times after the break. But below the picture of Iker Casillas looking distraught, the paper does offer some hope, saying: 'Chile and Australia, two games to demonstrate the talent and football that made us champions. Believe.' Not impressed: Spanish paper Marca hit out at Spain's defeat to Holland . Night to forget: Spain's goalkeeper Iker Casillas reacts after Robin van Persie scores his team's fourth goal . It also mentioned how Spain conceded more . goals in the match against Holland than they did in the whole of their . successful 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 campaigns. Marca say Casillas had a night to forget as Holland ‘dominated’ Spain in Salvador. AS report that Van Persie and Robben 'destroyed' the Spanish defence, el Periodico's headline reads 'red with shame' and Mundo Deportivo runs with 'Friday 13' with a picture of a forlorn Casillas. Spain coach Vicente del Bosque admitted to feeling physically sick by the nature of the defeat. Switzerland upset the eventual winners in the opening game four years ago but the manner of this humbling could be harder to bounce back from. ‘I feel sick, ill at ease, but with the courage a defeat must not sink us,’ he said. ‘It is not a happy moment, but first of all I want to congratulate the Dutch team, who were superior to us. We have been overwhelmed in the second half. End of the world: Spain's night went from bad to worse as they conceded five goals to Holland . Poor day: Diego Costa could not help Spain win their opening game . ‘We are a team of good professionals and good lads, everyone hurts, so there was no accusatory glances and that's good for the team. There will be time to talk.’ The veteran coach also declined to zero in on the performance of Casillas, who was to blame for two of Holland's goals in a shaky performance. Asked directly about his goalkeeper's display, Del Bosque said: ‘I insist that it is not the time to blame. The defeats do not come through the performance of a player, but by the weakness of the team. We cannot blame anyone, least of all Iker.’ Spain’s next group game is against Chile on Wednesday.","Spain beaten 5-1 by Holland in opening game of the defence of the World Cup .

"More than 30,000 spiders have battled it out for the ‘Best in Show' honour at what has become known as ‘Crufts for tarantulas’. While many people might find the spectacle of thousands of spiders terrifying, over 2,000 visitors gathered in Coventry to watch judges rank spiders according to the glossiness of their coats and their ‘alert’ demeanours. A Socotra Island Blue Baboon (Monocentropus balfouri) was awarded the top honour at the 29th annual British Tarantula Society exhibition at the Ricoh Arena in the city. Winner! This Socotra Island Blue Baboon (Monocentropus balfouri) was awarded the top honour at the 29th annual British Tarantula Society exhibition at the Ricoh Arena and beat around 30,000 other tarantulas to the coveted title that was awarded in Coventry . A Socotra Island Blue Baboon (Monocentropus balfouri) was awarded the top honour at the 29th annual British Tarantula Society exhibition at the Ricoh Arena. Judges looked at the glossiness of the creatures' coats, their proportions, the shape of the legs, colouring and the shape of the abdomen. One expert said: ‘The abdomen shouldn't show signs of overfeeding but be lean and rounded.’ The judges also looked for an 'alert' demeanour. Breeders had to pose the spiders correctly - including all eight legs - to show off their animal's anatomy. The spiders were judged according to their proportions, shape of legs and colouring, among other criteria. Owners of the arachnids had the tricky task of posing them correctly, as the judges expected all eight of the spiders’ legs to be perfectly positioned. It was the owner of the winning tarantula’s first time at the gathering, held on May 18 and he told National Geographic he is delighted with the win. Scary and stripy?

One spider breeder called Pete Lacey said that a freshly moulted adult stands the best chance of winning as its colours are at its brightest. Smitten or bitten? While they may be beautiful, some larger species of tarantula have large fangs capable of administering an unpleasant bite (pictured) even if their venom is not lethal to humans . The heat is on: The spider competitors were in with a chance of winning a number of categories (pictured). One spider breeder called Pete Lacey said that a freshly moulted adult stands the best chance of winning as its colours are at its brightest . The model specimen: As well as posing and having perfect markings, the spider's 'abdomen shouldn't show signs of overfeeding but be lean and rounded,' one expert said . Tarantulas are part of a group of very large arachnids that are often hairy, which belong to the Theraphosidae family of spiders. Approximately 900 species have been identified. Like all arthropods, tarantulas are invertebrates that rely on their exoskeleton for muscular support. They can be as small as a fingernail to as large as a dinner plate with legs spans of up to 12inches (30cm). The goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi) from Venezuela and Brazil is the largest variety. Tarantulas can be found in western states in the U.S. central and South America, Africa, Australia and in Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Italy and Cyprus in Europe. They have eight legs and two double-segment chelicerae that house the fangs which are located just below their eyes, near their mouth. They also contain the venom glands for the fangs, which are used to bite in defence and chew. A tarantula perceives its surroundings primarily via sensory organs called setae (hairs or spines). Although a tarantula has eyes, touch is its keenest sense, and in hunting it primarily depends on vibrations given off by the movements of its prey. However, they are also prey themselves and animals including the giant centipedes. He won Best Old World Arboreal at the . competition and said: ‘The abdomen shouldn't show signs of overfeeding . but be lean and rounded.’ Unlike Crufts, where winning pedigree dogs and their offspring can fetch thousands of pounds, winning the tarantula contest does not make owners rich. Mr Lacey said: ‘The value is in kudos, respect and pleasure in showing off a certain species in its prime.’ People fly in from the U.S. and Hong Kong to compete in the contest, which has grown from its old home in a village hall to the conference centre. The spider enthusiasts claim that the Theraphosidae family of tarantulas make great pets as they are clean and communicative, carry no diseases and can live for up to 30 years.

"Argentina left for Brazil on Monday trying to temper the sky-high expectations that have taken hold among some media, fans and even national football officials. The hundreds of Argentine fans who cheered the team on as it left Buenos Aires in a chartered jet have good reason to be confident. Argentina has a more close-knit team than when it got crushed by Germany in the quarterfinals four years ago, and 10 goals in qualifying helped star forward Lionel Messi shake off his reputation of underachieving for the national team.Â .

Send off: Argentina supporters follow the team bus as it takes the players to the airport in Buenos Aries . High fliers: Even the airplane transporting the players to Brazil is decorated with triumphant images . But the country's full potential is hard to assess because they haven't played a major football power since losing to Uruguay in their final World Cup qualifier in October. 'It's great that people are excited, but we're taking it step by step. We know the World Cup is difficult and anything can happen,' Messi said after Argentina beat Slovenia 2-0 in its last warm-up game. Ahead of the team's arrival, an Argentine federation official had a greeting put up on the gate of the team base in Belo Horizonte saying 'Welcome future champions.' He acknowledged that some players, including Messi, weren't thrilled by the triumphalism, and the sign was quickly removed. Clowning about: Argentina fans wearing jester hats vie for a position to see off their heroes . Hair raising! A young Argentina fan waits to say goodbye to the bus taking the players to the airport . After the Slovenia match Messi brushed off a TV reporter who asked whether he should bring a flag saying 'Argentina campeon' to Brazil. 'You bring what you want, we're taking it easy,' Messi said. Among the other title favorites, Germany have tested their strength in friendlies against England, Chile and Cameroon - all World Cup teams - and defending champion Spain took on three-time world champions Italy in March. Meanwhile, Argentina booked dress rehearsals this year against Romania, Trinidad and Tobago and Slovenia, none of which made it to the World Cup.

Argentina didn't concede a goal in those games, easing some concerns about their defence, but they don't say much about how the team will measure up against stronger adversaries. Argentina were drawn in what looks like one of the least competitive groups, with Nigeria, Iran and World Cup debutant Bosnia-Herzegovina. It's widely assumed that the Albiceleste will breeze through the group, though coach Alejandro Sabella won't be drawn into speculating about potential opponents in the next phase. 'I can't do futurology. We didn't end up in the most difficult group. But we're playing against physically strong teams,' Sabella said Saturday. 'We'll try to advance from the group phase, and if we do, get there with our players in good condition.'Â .","Lionel Messi has attempted to cool Argentina expectations of wining the World Cup in Brazil .

"Harassed? 90s Playgirl model Daniel Sawka is suing his former employer ADP after he says he suffered years of ridicule from employees because of his nude photos . A company that helps businesses handle personnel issues denies it forced one if its employees out of his job after it was discovered he had posed nude in Playgirl magazine. Daniel Sawka filed a federal civil rights lawsuit in May 2013 against Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Inc. alleging sexual harassment. The company responded in a court filing Monday. Sawka worked as a regional sales manager for ADP, which offers workforce management services, including payroll services and human resources management, for other companies and says it has more than 610,000 clients around the world. Sawka, who worked for ADP in Windsor and later in Milford, alleges he was subjected to constant jokes and ridicule at work after a woman in his office discovered he had posed nude in the early 1990s in a lumberjack-themed spread for Playgirl and found the photos online. Jokes included 'a comment about homosexual men viewing the photos and what they would be doing while viewing the photos,' according to the lawsuit. '(ADP) employees would say 'timber' or 'lumberjack' in reference to the plaintiff and the plaintiff's photos.' Sawka, 49, said his co-workers continued to download the pictures at work even after he implored them not to and to 'leave me alone.' He said company employees brought the issue up during a dinner in New York honoring Sawka for his job performance and during a company outing to a New York Yankees baseball game. He said he went to the company's personnel department in February 2011 and was promised the company would take appropriate actions. His body was joked about, reports ABC News, including his genitals' and one comment was made about 'what homosexual men viewing the photos would be doing while viewing the photos.' He alleges the company failed to end the ongoing sexual harassment and he was 'constructively discharged,' a legal term meaning the conditions were so intolerable he was forced to leave the job in March 2011. 'The sexual harassment ... that included managers participating in the sexual harassment, condoning it, and failing to stop it caused (Sawka) to be treated unequally when compared to similarly situated sales managers,' the lawsuit says. The company, in its response, denies there was a 'pattern and practice' of jokes, sexually charged comments and ridicule. It also says it 'exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any alleged harassing behavior.' Sawka, who lives in Durham, is seeking damages for lost pay and benefits and emotional distress. A telephone call seeking comment from his attorney on Monday was not immediately returned. Sawka is suing ADP for 'sexual harassment ... that included managers participating in the sexual harassment, condoning it, and failing to stop it' and wants back and front pay, bonuses, personal days, lost pension/retirement benefits, and emotional distress .","Daniel Sawka says he was subjected to constant jokes and ridicule at work after a woman at ADP discovered he had posed nude in the early 1990s .
