"A 21-year-old man was arrested today on suspicion of manslaughter after a pedestrian was killed by a lorry just moments after being involved in a dispute near a car wash. The victim, aged 26, was struck yesterday by the HGV in Quarry Bank, West Midlands, just seconds after he was involved in an argument with a man at the Formula 1 Hand Car Wash, police said. Eyewitnesses revealed that the man, who has not yet been named, had been fleeing an attacker wielding a hammer before being struck by the seven-ton vehicle at around 3.30pm. Aftermath: The 26 year old was struck yesterday by the HGV in Quarry Bank, West Midlands, just seconds after he was involved in an argument with a man at the Formula 1 Hand Car Wash, police said . Paramedics were called to the scene but despite their best efforts the man was pronounced dead at the scene. Det Sgt Jim Munro of West Midlands Police, said: ‘This collision happened at a busy time in the afternoon and I know there would have been a number of people in the area that witnessed it. ‘I’m also keen to hear from anyone who has any information about the dispute the man was involved in just before the collision.’ A neighbour who lives next door to the car wash said he saw a pick-up truck revving his engine before driving at the victim down an alleyway, which caused him to run out into the road. The man, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I saw a man in a Ford Ranger pick-up truck chasing the man who died at about 3.20pm yesterday. ‘The Ranger chased him and I saw the man run - then I heard a loud thud. It then reversed away like a bat out of hell on the dual carriageway. He was angry, he wanted to get hold of that man. ‘As soon as I heard the thud I ran . out, my partner ran over to the man to check his pulse but he was dead. It was a steel lorry - he had no chance, even though he was only going . at about 30mph.’ Investigation: Eyewitnesses revealed that the man, who has not yet been named, had been fleeing an attacker wielding a hammer before being struck by the seven-ton vehicle at around 3.30pm . Mother-of-two . Samantha Bowskill, who lives nearby, said: ‘The first we knew about it . was when we heard the sirens. We came out about 3.30pm when they were . putting the police ribbons up. ‘I thought it wasn’t a normal accident because they were closing the whole road.’ A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman added: ‘Crews arrived to find a pedestrian in a collision with a lorry. 'This collision happened at a busy time in the afternoon and I know there would have been a number of people in the area that witnessed it' Det Sgt Jim Munro, West Midlands Police . ‘Despite the efforts of ambulance staff at the scene, it quickly became apparent that nothing could be done to save the man and he was confirmed dead at the scene.’ The busy dual carriageway was closed for more than four hours in both directions while police carried out investigations. Another local resident, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘Apparently there was one bloke running after another man with a hammer in his hand. ‘We don’t know what was said between the pair but it’s certainly ended in real tragedy.’","Victim aged 26 struck yesterday by HGV in Quarry Bank, West Midlands .

"Calvin Connah has been jailed for killing a mother-to-be and her unborn baby daughter while driving 'aggressively and intimidatingly' in his father's BMW . It was supposed to be the most exciting time of Graham Clarke’s life. His pregnant girlfriend was just one day away from starting maternity leave and the couple were about to move into their first home after spending months lovingly renovating it. Instead the self-employed builder found himself surveying the devastating scene of his girlfriend and baby daughter lying side by side in hospital, after they were killed by a speeding driver. ‘My future was taken away in an instant,’ said Mr Clarke, 38. ‘Nothing will ever be the same again.’ Yesterday Calvin Connah, 22, was jailed for just five years, and could be freed in half that time. Christina Barchetti, who was 35 weeks pregnant, died along with her unborn child after Connah, speeding at 85mph, lost control of his high-powered car and crashed head-on into hers. The hospital administration assistant, 35, suffered terrible injuries when her Ford Ka was pushed through a wall and into woodland. She was taken to hospital and her daughter, whom the couple had already named Bella, was delivered by Caesarean, but neither could be saved. ‘Christina was a young, beautiful girl with her whole life ahead of her,’ Mr Clarke said. ‘We had talked about getting married. I knew she was the one. ‘But seeing her in hospital with Bella next to her after they had gone was heartbreaking. ‘It felt unreal, like a bad dream. Bella looked just perfect and I was able to hold her in my arms and cuddle her, but never bring her home. ‘He’s [Connah] taken two lives  and he’ll serve just two and a half years. For us, no sentence will ever  be enough. He has given us a life sentence. ‘The pain of losing Christina and baby Bella will always be with us, the devastation this person has caused is unbearable.’ Connah killed hospital worker Christina Barchetti (pictured with her partner Graham Clarke) who was eight months pregnant, while driving on the A541 road at Pontblyddyn, Wales, on October 22 last year. The 35-year-old died at Wrexham Maelor Hospital where she worked and her baby daughter - whom she had named Bella  - was still-born during an emergency Caesarian operation . Connah (pictured at court), 22, of Leeswood near Mold, admitted causing death by careless driving, but denied causing death by driving dangerously on the A541 road at Pontblyddyn, on October 22 last year . Miss Barchetti, who worked at Wrexham . Maelor Hospital’s medical engineering department, was on her way to her . parents’ home in the North Wales town when the accident happened in . October. But as she drove . along the A541, at Pontblyddyn, near Mold, her car was hit head-on by . Connah, who was driving his father’s BMW 318i in the opposite direction. During . a three-day trial, Mold Crown Court heard that Connah had braked . suddenly after overtaking a car at the end of a 70mph dual carriageway. He denied speeding and claimed that he had lost control on the bend because it had been raining. But . witnesses told how he was driving dangerously at speeds of up to 90mph . before the crash occurred at the start of the 50mph zone. Mold Crown Court head that Connah was driving his father¿s BMW 318 Ti and decided to over-take another car at the end of a 70 mph dual-carriageway, the prosecution said .

Clarke, also of Leeswood, said he would be lobbying Parliament to try to . change the law with regard to the unborn victims of road smashes. ‘Connah was charged with the death of Christina, but not baby Bella,’ Mr Clarke said. ‘Because she didn’t get chance to take a breath in the outside world her death didn’t count.’","Calvin Craig Connah killed eight months pregnant Christina Barchetti .

"Luke McCormick, 30, who was jailed in 2008 for killing two brothers while twice over the legal drink-drive limit, has been made captain at Plymouth Argyle . A disgraced goalkeeper who killed two brothers while twice over the legal drink-drive limit has been appointed as the new captain of his football club. Plymouth Argyle is facing criticism after making Luke McCormick the club skipper, one year after he returned to the League Two side following a spell in prison for the fatal crash. The 30-year-old was jailed for seven years and four months in 2008 after killing Aaron Peak, ten, and his brother Ben, eight, both from Partington, Greater Manchester, on the M6 motorway near Keele. The goalkeeper, who was driving at 97mph, had downed beer and Sambuca shots at a former team-mate's wedding before driving his car. He was jailed after pleading guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, as well as charge of drink-driving. But now officials at the club have given the goalkeeper a second chance, by offering him the prestigious captaincy of the club. The goalkeeper has been publicly backed by the club and its manager, despite fans taking to Twitter to vent their anger. Former teammate Guy Branston said: 'I think Luke McCormick will be a . fantastic club captain, and shouldn’t be disregarded just because of a . mistake he made in his past. 'Take . away what he did - and served time for - and bring it back to the here . and now, and he deserves the accolade of being club captain. 'I spoke to Luke in detail about what happened and about being in prison, and I think he is an asset to the football club. 'I . obviously don’t agree with what he did as drinking and driving is . disgusting, but he has served his time and is trying to move on with his . life.' McCormick, who was released from prison in 2012, played for Plymouth Argyle for eight years before his contract was terminated due to the crash. He returned to the club this summer, saying he had 'a point to prove' in the wake of the incident. He said: 'I’m hungrier than I’ve ever been. I feel like I have got a point to prove, which I didn’t necessarily have as much last time I was here. The footballer, pictured here at his court case, said he had 'a point to prove' following his return to the League Two club this summer . 'I owe this club for giving me the chance and I’ve got a lot to repay the fans for, and I’m determined to make this a success.' But although have backed McCormick, some fans criticised the move on social networking sites. Jamie Hawkins commented: 'Plymouth Argyle remaining classy as ever' and Jamie Chown said: 'Luke McCormick backed as Plymouth Argyle club captain... JOKE!!!!!!"". The crash, which took place on the M6 near Keele services, killed Aaron Peak, 10, pictured left and his brother Ben, 8, second from right. Their father Philip, now 43, also pictured with the boys' mother Amanda, was injured in the incident . Another . using the handle @NorthernMisery said: 'Plays for Plymouth. After . killing two kids. ******* disgraceful.' The . fatal incident took place in June 2008 when McCormick, who had slept . for just two hours before driving, fell asleep at the wheel of his Range . Rover. His car - which was travelling at 97mph on the 70mph motorway - hit the Peak family's Toyota and killed the two boys. Their father Philip, now 43, who was taking his family to Silverstone when the crash took place, suffered 'horrific' injuries. After the player was jailed, mother Amanda Peak said: 'Our sons will never experience the things Luke has had. 'Phil will carry the scars of the incident for life. We will both carry the emotional scars forever.'","Luke McCormick jailed in 2008 after killing Aaron Peak, 10 and brother Ben, 8 .

The driver, Lee Dong, 28, lost control of his car and killed a pedestrian before leaving the scene at high speed. A nearby patrol car gave chase and the driver pulled alongside Dong, in a bid to get him to pull over. Lee Dong rammed a police car off the road with his car, pictured, during a high-speed chase in which three people died . The police car, pictured, careered into a group of pedestrians including a girl in a push-chair after Dong forced it off the road .

"This horrific picture shows the appalling injuries suffered by a cyclist when he was thrown from his bike on his way to work after hitting a giant pothole. Richard Gummery, 45, was pedalling downhill at 30mph but didn’t spot the massive crater - which was 18 inches long and 5inches deep. The father-of-one - who cycles 70 miles a week - was catapulted off his bike and suffered a broken elbow as well as multiple cuts to his face and head. He was taken to hospital by his brother where doctors discovered he had shattered a bone in his elbow. Horrific: Richard Gummery at hospital after he broke his arm and gashed his face after crashing into a pothole on his bicycle. Shocking pictures taken at Hereford County Hospital’s A&E show Mr Gummery's face caked in blood following the painful fall. He needed an emergency three-hour operation and spent two nights in hospital before being sent home in a plaster cast to recover. Today, Mr Gummery, who lives in Much Dewchurch, Herefordshire, blasted his local council for not doing more to keep the roads safe. He said: 'You often have people like me who work early hours and when you cannot see the potholes it becomes particularly difficult. He needed an emergency three-hour operation and spent two nights in hospital before being sent home in a plaster cast to recover . 'The main roads are okay, but the side roads are appalling. Tidying up the roads must be one of Herefordshire Council’s top priorities. 'I’ve been cycling for 20 years and on the side roads it has definitely got worse. Once they are there and reported, they should be filled in. 'People pay their council taxes and all you ask is they collect the bins on time and keep the roads tidy. 'But it has obviously not been happening.' He was on his way to work at Boots in Hereford at 5.15am on March 19 when he hit the pothole. He was taken to hospital and had the operation on his elbow the next day before being sent home on March 21. Mr Gummery said he had cycled the seven-and-a-half mile journey five days a week for the last 20 years but this is the first time he has had a serious accident. He added: 'I had my lights on but I didn’t see the pothole. 'I cycle every day to work at Boots and normally I go straight down and stick to the A and B roads.'But I decided to go down Knocker Hill Lane which is a country road and was going downhill so probably going at 30mph when I hit the pothole. 'I didn’t quite go over the handlebars but went down and made sure my body took the impact. 'I landed on my elbow, which ended up broken and also had lots of grazes on the side of my face. 'I shattered a bone in my elbow which required a plate and screws and was operated on the next day. 'It’s not too painful now but there’s a huge cast on it and it’s restrictive but hopefully I’ll be more mobile in a few weeks time.' Transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin confirmed this week that Herefordshire Council will get £3,538,803 for road repairs following the wet winter and North Herefordshire’s Tory MP Bill Wiggin has urged the council to use the money to make the roads safe. He said: 'We desperately need to act to fix the potholes on our roads to make the county safe again for cyclists and motorists.'","Richard Gummery, 45, was flung from bike by large hole .

"Created: . 12:14 GMT, 10 June 2014 . When Janina Wasiuta was unable to use her normal parking space, she left her car on a slip road at a supermarket yards from the beauty salon where she works. But she returned to find to her horror that staff at the Aldi store had smashed a window to get in, then pushed the Ford Fiesta into a bush, scratching the body. They claimed the ten-year-old vehicle had been obstructing a delivery lorry trying to use the private access road. Dumped: Janina Wasiuta finished work to discover . her red £4,000 Ford Fiesta pushed off the road with the driver’s window . in pieces and glass over the seat . In a bush: The beauty therapist, who works just a . hundred yards away, had moved from her regular parking spot which was . closed due to maintenance work . Angry: Miss Wasiuta said there were no double yellow lines or signs telling her she couldn't park in the road . Yesterday beauty therapist Miss . Wasiuta, 29, accused Aldi of vandalising her car, which was towed to a . garage for repairs. She has reported staff to police. ‘It’s . unbelievable – I’ve basically had my car vandalised by a big . supermarket chain,’ she said yesterday. ‘I’ve been told it will take two . weeks to repair it, which means I’m paying £8 a day in taxi fares – on . top of my £95 insurance excess. ‘If . someone blocked my drive and I damaged their car trying to move it, I’d . have the police round. Why should Aldi be any different? The store’s . attitude was disgusting – they didn’t even put a note on my window, they . just left the car in a bush. There are no double yellow lines or signs. There were cars parked behind me and I don’t see how my car was causing . an obstruction. ‘The . salon’s only a moment away – why did no one come in to see if it . belonged to an employee or a customer before smashing their way in?’ Yesterday three plastic barriers had been put up in an effort to stop people parking on the access road in Chorley, Lancashire. Janina Wasiuta finished work to discover her red £4,000 Ford Fiesta pushed off the road and in a bush . When Miss Wasiuta returned to her car she found it in bushes with the windows smashed in . Aldi . said: ‘We have apologised to Miss Wasiuta and are covering all costs of . the damage to her vehicle and all the associated expenses. ‘As a very last resort we had to move a vehicle that was preventing an Aldi delivery truck from reversing into the loading bay. 'Our . store staff had searched for the owner for more than four hours. They . also contacted the local police to try and obtain the registered owner’s . details. 'Unfortunately these were not available. 'After every other option was taken into consideration, the car was then moved by Aldi staff. 'The owner of the car returned at approximately 9pm, three hours after we moved it. Staff at the Aldi say they were forced to break into the car so a delivery driver could access the store . Picture shows where Janina's car was parked before members of staff broke in and pushed it out of the way . The Aldi in Chorly, Lancashire, where staff broke in to a customer's car to move it out of the way . 'We . are in communication with the car owner to rectify the damage caused, . have offered to pay for all repairs and have apologised for any . inconvenience.' Lancashire County Council said: 'It’s not an LCC highway. It’s a private road.' While police can . tow away a vehicle causing an obstruction on a public road, rules of . trespass apply to a car parked on private land, legal experts say. The . landowner could claim for trespass but any award would be likely to be . as low as £20. And anyone damaging a car while trying to move it could . be sued in the small claims court and face prosecution for criminal . damage. Paul Watters, from . the AA, said: ‘Motorists who cause an obstruction are a source of great . frustration, but taking direct action in the knowledge it will cause . damage to the car is completely unacceptable.’ Police are investigating last Friday’s incident as possible criminal damage. The red £4,000 Ford Fiesta (pictured in the background) was pushed off the road and left with the driver¿s window in pieces and glass over the seat .

"A young driver who crashed her car into a rail and killed her friend after he pulled her bikini top string as she drove at 65mph has been cleared. Brittany Lahm, 24, from Manhattan, crashed on the Thruway, New York, in July 2008, killing Brandon Berman, 19, and injuring several other passengers. Moments before Mr Berman had playfully untied her bathing suit top as they returned home from a day at Jersey Shore to celebrate Mr Berman's 19th birthday. Ruling: Brittany Lahm, 24, from Manhattan, crashed on the Thruway, New York, in July 2008, killing Brandon Berman, 19 and injuring several other passengers . Miss Lahm took her hands off the wheel to cover up and the Lexus veered off course and struck the guardrail, flipped multiple times in the air, before coming to rest on its roof in the middle of the southbound lanes. Mr Berman of New City was a rear seat passenger - he was partially ejected and suffered massive head trauma. He was pronounced dead at Nyack Hospital. The Brooklyn Appellate Division upheld the conclusion of a Rockland jury, which found Miss Lahm's bikini top problem constituted 'a sudden and unforeseen emergency not of her own making' reported the New York Daily News. It was decided that even though Mr Berman had acted disruptively throughout car ride, 'Brittany did not anticipate that he would suddenly pull the strings on her bikini top, thereby causing the top to fall and her breasts to be exposed.' Day out: Mr Berman playfully untied Miss Lahm's bathing suit top as they returned home from a day at Jersey Shore (pictured) The decision was taken following a civil trial brought by Jason Pelletier of Suffern. He sued Miss Lahm for damages after his promising football career at Yale University was cut short due to his injuries. He was in the rear seat of the car and testified at the 2011 trial that Miss Lahm had leaned forward for up to 20 seconds as she tried to retie her bikini top. His lawyers argued she should have pulled over saying 'the plaintiff argues that Defendant Brittany Lahm should have slowed her vehicle down, kept both hands on the wheel, and pulled off of the highway, before attempting to re-tie her bathing suit, and the mere fact that she may have been embarrassed by the exposure of her breasts to the passengers in the car does not excuse her failure to do so.' But Miss Lahm testified that her hands were off the steering wheel for only a split second and the jury absolved her of any liability. The dissenting appellate judge, Justice Sheri Roman, said that Mr Berman’s behavior was disruptive before the bikini top prank - he had opened an umbrella inside the car and stuck his feet in the driver’s face. 'That Brandon would ultimately commit an act which would cause Brittany to lose control of the vehicle, under the circumstances of this case, cannot be deemed sudden or unexpected,' Ms Roman wrote. Miss Lahm now works as an 'Assistant to GM of WWE Music Group' according to her LinkedIn page. In 2011 she graduated from Syracuse University following a four year degree in Music & Entertainment Industries. Before the crash Miss Lahm was a member of pop music girl band Huckapoo - each member portrayed a character from a different social group typically found on any high school campus and Miss Lahm was a cheerleader. After the ruling Miss Lahm declined to comment.","Brittany Lahm, 24, .

"A hitch-hiker is 'lucky to be alive' after a van driver who picked her up sped straight into a train on a level crossing. Martina Jankowska, 26, got the lift in Radom, Poland, but within minutes the driver accelerated towards the tracks where the van was hit by a freight train. Police in the city in the centre of Poland are now searching for the driver, who fled after the crash. Police said Martina Jankowska is 'lucky to be alive' after a driver who picked her up drove straight into an oncoming train . The driver in Radom, Poland, fled after the crash and is now being hunted by police . Investigators said they were amazed to find Ms Jankowska conscious in the passenger seat of the damaged van. She told police afterwards: 'I saw the train coming and thought he'd stop any minute. But he didn't - he just kept going.' Ms Jankowska told investigators she did not think the driver had been drinking. The vehicle was shunted off the tracks by the oncoming train. The van's hood was completely crushed and the windscreen was smashed. Ms Jankowska was taken to hospital with a broken leg, bruising and suffering from shock. One of the witnesses at the scene said: 'We had been driving behind the . van and the crossing was clearly signposted stating that there were no . barriers and that drivers should be careful. 'But instead of slowing down to check if it was safe to cross, this driver seemed to speed up. 'Luckily the train was a cargo train and going at a fairly slow speed, . otherwise I dread to think what would have happened.' Rescuers found Ms Jankowska conscious in the passenger seat of the van after it was hit by the freight train . Another witness said: 'We saw the car two ahead of us hit by the train. It was terrifying. 'We jumped out to go and help when the driver leapt out and sprinted off across a field. 'We found a passenger inside who was in shock. 'We phoned the police and an ambulance straight away.' Police are now trying to trace the driver through the van’s number plate or forensic clues left by the motorist. Police spokesman Andrzej Lewicki said: 'The driver had fled on foot. His passenger was taken to hospital and is lucky to be alive. 'We don’t know why he drove onto the tracks nor why he then ran off, but according to the passenger he was sober. 'We didn’t find any documents in the vehicle but hopefully something will turn up on our database. 'Failing that, the van will be examined for fingerprints and other bits . of evidence that can help identify the man.'","Police said Martina Jankowska was 'lucky to be alive' after the crash .

"Putting his foot down: Ferguson immediately decreed that no player under the age of 23 - no matter their standing in the team - should be allowed to order a sporty model . Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has banned the club's young stars from driving flashy sports cars from new sponsors Chevrolet. The club recently signed a multi-million-pound deal with the American car giant, who will become  the name on the club's shirts from the start of the 2014-15 season. As a gesture of goodwill, Chevrolet . immediately offered United's first-team stars a choice of luxury cars. And unsurprisingly, many of the club's big names plumped for the 198mph Corvette supercar. However, Ferguson . immediately intervened and decreed that no player under the age of 23 - . no matter their standing in the team - should be allowed to order a . sporty model. This . means players such as young striker Danny Welbeck, 21, and defenders . Phil Jones, 20, Chris Smalling, 22, and Rafael da Silva, 22, will be . banned from driving anything not approved by Ferguson. Instead only the more experienced . drivers, such as Rio Ferdinand, 33, and Ryan Giggs, 38, will be allowed . behind the wheel of the £32,000 sports car. In . 2009, United midfielder Christiano Ronaldo wrote off his £200,000 . Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano  into a tunnel wall as he drove to United's . training complex in Manchester. And . in 2003 reserve striker Jimmy Davis died in a collision with a lorry as . he drove his grey 3-series BMW in the early hours of the morning on the . M40. The move is a classic case of . Ferguson - a known micro-manager of his players - ensuring his young . stars don't get too big for their boots. Ferguson is acutely aware of how times have changed since taking over in . 1986 and has accepted that he cannot control every facet of his . players' lives the way he used to. Stalled: United's youngsters won't be driving one of these iconic Chevrolet Corvettes . Banned: It means players such as defender Phil Jones, 20, left, and . young striker Danny Welbeck, 21, right, will be banned from driving . anything not approved by Ferguson . But the 68-year-old manager still becomes irritated by the manner in . which young players are given too much too soon. Two years ago, for example, it emerged . he told players in the club's youth squads they were not allowed to wear . coloured football boots. While . first-team stars such as Wayne Rooney, Dimitar Berbatov and Ryan Giggs . are free to wear what they like in order to keep up with the demands of . their sponsors, Ferguson decreed that youth team and academy players . must wear black. Wrecked: In 2009, United midfielder Christiano Ronaldo wrote off his £200,000 Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano into a tunnel wall as he drove to United's training complex in Manchester . An Old Trafford source said: 'Sir Alex doesn't . like young players to get ahead of themselves. He thinks their feet . should be on the ground.' Last night a United spokesperson confirmed: 'As with most automotive partnerships, Chevrolet will be offering players a car. The model will be dependent on their time at the club and driving experience.'","Chevrolet will become the name on the .

"Millions of drivers have been warned about higher fuel costs and even engine damage if they use a new ‘green’ petrol. Britain has signed up to an EU directive which says suppliers must dilute petrol with environmentally-friendly alternatives such as ethanol made from corn. The new petrol is called E10 and is 10 per cent ethanol. It is due to be launched in the UK later this year, alongside standard petrol and other green fuels. Paying extra at the pump: The new biofuel gives fewer miles to the gallon . However, a study today warns E10 gives fewer miles to the gallon, so a typical family will pay around £80 a year extra to travel the same distance. There are also fears that the high ethanol content can effectively melt components of some engines in older cars and motorbikes. Up to 8.6million vehicles may not be compatible with E10 fuel, according to estimates by the Department for Transport. Its arrival on forecourts will be confusing for drivers unless pumps are clearly labelled and they know whether it is safe for their car. Possible inclusion in the Budget: David Cameron has hinted at a cut or freeze in fuel duty to help drivers struggling with his prices . The move to E10 is part of a wider policy to cut the use of fossil fuels and so reduce their contribution to the creation of greenhouse gases and global warming. A study by respected think-tank Chatham House warns: ‘The increased use of ethanol in petrol to meet EU sustainability targets is resulting in drivers paying extra at the pump.’ The EU’s Renewable Fuel Transport Obligation requires 5 per cent of the fuel supply of member states to be renewable by 2014. This is due to increase in the next seven years under the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive, which requires 10 per cent of transport energy from renewable sources by 2020. Oil companies have decided to use ethanol as this renewable source. Most comes from the US, where it is made from corn, while some comes from Brazil’s sugar cane and a small amount from British sugar beet. However, using petrol diluted with ethanol generally cuts a vehicle’s fuel efficiency. The report calculates that if the EU policy of supplying 10 per cent of transport energy from renewable sources had been applied in the UK in 2011-12, it would have cost motorists some £1.5billion, or around £80 a year more per family. Biofuel: A fuel nozzle serving E10 at a petrol station in Berlin . Author Rob Bailey, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, warned E10 petrol is not compatible with millions of older vehicles. ‘Based on case studies in other countries that have introduced E10, field trials and laboratory tests, the research found issues of material incompatibility, corrosion and drivability problems for vehicles of ten years or older,’ he said. E10 was introduced in Germany two years ago. Many drivers have decided not to use it in case it damages their engines. ‘German motorists are also thought to be suspicious of the wider environmental and social impacts of ethanol,’ said Mr Bailey. The Government has asked suppliers to delay introducing E10 to allow time for an information campaign and to compile a list of incompatible vehicles for drivers. Mr Bailey, a former top official with Oxfam, added that taking farmland out of food production to grow fuel crops also threatens to put up food prices. He said: ‘Biofuels increase the level and volatility of food prices, generating social impacts in low income food importing countries.’ The study was funded by Olleco, a business which collects and refines waste cooking oil to be used as biodiesel in vehicles. Mr Bailey and Olleco argue this is a better option than ethanol.","E10 means a typical family will pay around £80 a year extra for petrol .

"If the driver of this Land Rover was looking for a good parking spot on the way to work this morning, this is probably the last thing she had in mind. And the cost of repairing the smashed up vehicle will cost a lot more than your average parking ticket. Fortunately the woman driver of the Discovery escaped this nasty looking incident relatively unscathed but her car came off considerably the worse for wear. Wrong turning: Fortunately the driver of this Land Rover Discovery escaped serious injury when her car careered into a subway in Chelmsford, Essex, this morning . Smash: Police cordoned off part of the road after the car collided with a bus and crashed through the subway railings . It landed flat on its front and was left . perched precariously against the wall of a subway in Chelmsford, Essex, . at around 9.30am this morning. The car had collided with a bus on Parkway before careering through the metal crash barriers and down into the underpass. Luckily, there were no pedestrians walking down the path at the time of the crash. The smash happened on a busy stretch of road close to the town centre and a number of shops and businesses. Stuck: Police officers look on as the back end of the black Land Rover can be seen above a line of traffic on the busy Essex road . One witness said that the subway is often used by children heading to a nearby school. A section of the road was closed off and eventually the car was lifted out of the subway using a small crane. Onlookers gathered to take pictures of the unusual sight while police cordoned off the walkway. The driver of the car was taken to hospital but received only minor injuries. No one was arrested following the crash and the road was reopened shortly afterwards. Wrecked: The car had to be pulled from the underpass using a crane while dozens of people looked on and took pictures .","A Land Rover Discovery crashed after hitting a bus in Chelmsford, Essex .

"A driver has racked up Britain's biggest ever parking fine after being slapped with a £14,000 bill for leaving his car in disabled bays with abusive messages on the windscreen. David Lee, 37, ignored 140 tickets in one year after parking his Ford Mondeo across disabled bays in dozens of private car parks across Lincoln. He has already been served with four county court judgements totalling more than £3,000 by Leeds-based firm UK Car Parking Solutions (UKCPS). Scroll down for video . David Lee, 37, from Lincolnshire,  ignored more than 140 parking tickets in one year and faces a £14,000 fine . And the firm intends to issue a further £10,000 worth of charges before the courts, as well as an estimated £1,000 in costs. His total bill is higher than that racked up by footballer Mario Balotelli, who was hit with nearly £10,000 in parking fines when he played for Manchester City in 2011. Mr Lee's Ford Mondeo was often ticketed for being parked across disabled bays as well as being carelessly left across multiple spots. He  left unpaid and damaged parking tickets on the car's dashboard - with a notice labelling the Leeds firm 'UK Car Park Scammers'. His Ford Mondeo was often  left across disabled spots, pictured with an Audi not believed to belong to him . Mr Lee carelessly left his car across multiple disabled bays in private car parks across Lincoln . He also wrote a note claiming the charges were unenforceable. Speaking outside his £100,000 semi-detached house in Scampton, near Lincoln, Mr Lee said: 'I am very embarrassed about all this.' Steve Hall, UKCPS legal manager, said: 'This is one of the highest parking charge debts to be served on a single motorist in the UK for parking on private land. 'Four of the undefended county court judgements amount to £3,265, with an additional £10,000 still to be issued. 'The vehicle was often parked across more than one bay. On many occasions, the charges were for parking out of marked bays and without authority. 'The vehicle dashboard was clearly visible for all passing people to see, scattered with unpaid parking tickets. He left unpaid and damaged parking tickets on the car's dashboard and left abusive messages . 'UKCPS have had letters returned to us by Mr Lee after being cut up into small pieces. 'Staff have reconstructed the relevant section of the pages to discover the parking charge numbers referred back to the vehicle.' Mr Lee, who lives in Scampton, Lincolnshire, attended Lincoln County Court earlier this month. But UKCPS said they have not received any money from the driver. A spokeswoman for the British Parking Association said: 'UKCPS are a member of our organisation and operate under our code of practice. 'They have every right to take people to court.'","David Lee, 37, from Lincolnshire has racked up £14,000 in parking fines .

"Supercars are normally hard to miss on the high street, particularly when they're bright yellow, but a police officer was unable to avoid crashing into a Ferrari after an unsuccessful attempt at a u-turn. Onlookers were stunned as they watched the silver BMW police car scrunch into the back of the Ferrari 458 Spider, which is worth around £250,000. While a Metropolitan Police spokesman . said it was too early to say who was at fault, witnesses who saw the incident on Sunday night report seeing . the squad car attempting a three-point turn on the Edgware Road in London. A police BMW has apparently crashed into the back of a £250,000 Ferrari 458 Spider causing £2,500 of damage . A witness said that the Ferrari driver was reversing in order to pick up a friend when the squad car tried to make a three-point turn before the two vehicles locked bumpers . They said it failed to notice the supercar reversing before it smashed into the supercar. The two vehicles then locked bumpers, with the Ferrari faring considerably worse with a large chunk of bodywork left hanging off. The owner of the Ferrari, who wanted to remain anonymous, said the police car did not do a three-point turn but just attempted a u-turn. 'I was slowly reversing at 4mph and the police car was on the other side of the road. Instead of doing a three-point turn he just drove round and hit me.' He said the police car's lights went on after the incident and that he was then breathalysed at the scene. 'It . was quite a shunt and I had to stand outside in the cold for two hours . while they were wearing warm jackets. They didn't let me sit inside a . car.' He said repairs to the Ferrari would cost up to £30,000 to repair.

"The angry mother of a victim of the Oxford sex grooming gang last night demanded: ‘Someone needs to take the blame.’ Catastrophic failings by police and social services enabled the sadistic group to drug, rape and traffic girls as young as 11 for eight years. Victims repeatedly told police they had been abused and sexually tortured and care-home staff just watched as the men collected the under-age girls at night. But despite the catalogue of appalling blunders and missed opportunities – and David Cameron warning police and council chiefs they faced ‘very searching questions’ – nobody is  prepared to take the blame. Scroll down for video . Oxfordshire County Council's chief executive Joanna Simons, left, and Thames Valley Police chief constable Sara Thornton, right, have both refused to resign despite their organisations' failure to stop the abuse sooner . Seven members of a paedophile ring were found guilty at the Old Bailey of a catalogue of child sex abuse charges . Both Thames  Valley Police Chief . Constable Sara Thornton and Joanna Simons, head of Oxfordshire County . Council, say they will not resign. Their defiance, a day after the seven . vicious and ‘medieval’ predators were convicted at the Old Bailey, came . as: . Most of the eight-year campaign of . abuse by the gang took place after Miss Thornton was appointed head of . the Thames Valley force in 2007. Brothers Bassam Karrar (left) and Mohammed Karrar (right) were found guilty at the Old Bailey yesterday . Assad Hussain was cleared of raping Child A but convicted of having sex with a child . She yesterday apologised for not . acting sooner, but when asked if she had considered resigning from her . £160,000-a-year post, she said: ‘The focus has got to be moving forward. I think the focus for me is on driving improvements in the future.’ Five of the six girls were abused . while in the care of Oxfordshire County Council’s social services . department. But Miss Simons also said she was not quitting her . £182,000-a-year job as chief executive. She said: ‘My gut feeling is that I am . not going to resign because my determination is that we need to do all . that we can to take action to stamp this out. ‘[We are] incredibly sorry that we . weren’t able to stop this abuse any sooner . . . what we understand now . is much more about the grooming process. 'We didn’t understand that going . back seven or eight years ago. ‘All I can do is apologise if we didn’t listen enough, if we didn’t do enough.’ The mother of one of the victims, only . 14 when the gang began plying her with drink and drugs before . exploiting her for sex, said: ‘Oxford Social Services has failed our . children and someone has to pay for it. ‘They were supposed to be looking . after my child, yet the social workers went home at night knowing that . she was being abused and did nothing. Brothers Anjum Dogar (left) and Akhtar Dogar (right) have been convicted of offences involving underage girls . Zeeshan Ahmed (left) and Kamar Jamil (right) were among those who were convicted today at the Old Bailey . ‘The police are talking about there . being more victims, something like 50 more girls, who they want to come . forward. But how can they expect them to have the courage to come . forward when these six girls have been failed so badly.’ Speaking in New York, the Prime . Minister refused to defend the Chief Constable and county council chief, . saying the authorities would have to ‘respond for themselves in terms . of what happened’. Mr Cameron, an Oxfordshire MP, said: . ‘It really is just appalling, absolutely appalling – it’s shocking what . took place. Everyone’s going to have to ask some very searching . questions about how this was allowed to continue for so long.’ Abuse was carried out at the Nanford Guest House in Oxford. Pictured is a room at the guest house . CCTV issued by Thames Valley Police of Mohammed Karrar, who was convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child, during an interview with the police . As with similar outrages in Rochdale . and Rotherham, police officers, social workers and staff in residential . homes knew or suspected that children were being used and sold for sex . by large numbers of men. But a catalogue of opportunities to stop the abuse were missed from as early as May 2005. Two of the three care homes where victims of the Oxford gang lived have been closed down. But only one person has been sacked – a . manager at Dell Quay, a privately run care home in Henley-on-Thames . where the council placed girls, was dismissed after refusing to pay a . victim’s taxi fare when she returned after running away. The 14-year-old was driven back to Oxford where she was raped. Steve Heywood, assistant chief . constable of Greater Manchester Police, said yesterday: ‘Our No 1 . priority at the moment is child sexual exploitation. It is now ahead of . gun crime. Expect a lot more convictions.’ Kamar Jamil, 27, who was convicted of rape, facilitating child prostitution and trafficking, during an interview with the police . Prosecutors . have pledged to 're-review' three historic cases involving victims of . the Oxford sex ring after admitting more could have been done to . investigate their claims. The . Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it would look again at the . decision to take no further action over the allegations of abuse . involving the girls from 2005 to 2006. In one case, the CPS said information was requested from Thames Valley Police but the force did not respond. Baljit . Ubhey, chief crown prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern, said the CPS . would now be more 'proactive' when dealing with sex abuse allegations. She said: 'We want to encourage people who have experienced something similar to have the courage to come forward. 'What . we shouldn't do is as soon as we see a weakness - the girls had taken . drugs or alcohol or they lied about something in the past - that means, . ""this case is hopeless and we can't go ahead with it"". 'Rather . than be fatalistic and negative, it's about being really positive and . saying, ""how can we really get to the truth here?""' Ms Ubhey admitted the CPS should have pursued Thames Valley Police when information was first requested about one of the claims. The further allegations do not involve any of the defendants involved in the Old Bailey trial, she added. 'I think we could have been more proactive,' Ms Ubhey said. 'Of four cases we looked at, in three of those it's arguable we might have been able to do more. 'What . I can't say is that we will change our decision. What I can say is . perhaps we could have taken a more proactive approach in making further . enquiries.' Ms Ubhey confirmed a serious case review would be conducted following the conclusion of the trial.She . said she expected more cases of a similar nature to come to light as . new guidance is issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in . the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Ms . Ubhey added: 'I think what these cases have highlighted is that they're . probably not isolated incidents and there's probably more of this . activity going on.'","Sara Thornton, who has been chief constable of Thames Valley Police since 2007, rejects suggestions she should resign .

"This is the criminal family at the centre of a huge 'cash for crash' fraud which led to drivers in the county paying £100 extra for their car insurance. Police and fraud investigators uncovered . the scam while monitoring the Wright family, from . Burnhope, as part of an investigation into organised crime in County Durham. Sixty people have now been convicted for their part in the fraud which involved hundreds of faked, fictitious or exaggerated crashes. Alan Wright, left, is said to be head of the family and faked four crashes in just 10 months. Jonathan Wright, right, was jailed for 30 months for his part in the scam . Joseph Wright, left, and Joseph Anthony Wright, right, are among 60 people convicted for their part in the fraud . Robert Wright, left, was jailed for nine months while Paul Jonathon Wright, right, is awaiting sentencing for running an auto shop where he made false claims for storing damaged cars and hiring out replacements . They include seven members of the Wright family, including head of the clan Alan Wright. The 49-year-old was jailed for four years after a trial at Newcastle Crown Court last year. A joint operation, codenamed Operation Nacho, between Durham police and the Insurance Fraud Bureau focused on 1,800 accidents handled by two particular firms. They quickly identified 261 as appearing suspicious. Investigators suspected some were entirely fictitious, some staged and some vastly exaggerated. They identified 25 accidents which were considered to have the highest impact on the public, both financially and in terms of suspected organised crime involvement, and these were selected for detailed investigation. Those 25 accidents alone resulted in more than £514,000 being obtained for the claimants. A series of trials involving 70 defendants began last year at Newcastle Crown Court, with 60 people convicted or pleading guilty to being involved. Andrew Piggford was jailed for two years for his part in the fraud . Judge Roger Thorn today lifted an order which prevented the media from reporting any of the proceedings. Key players included 40-year-old Paul Jonathon Wright, known as Jonty, who ran PJ Autos, a recovery, storage and vehicle hire business. He is yet to be sentenced for his part in the scam which involved making false claims for storing damaged cars and hiring out replacement vehicles at up to £200 a day. Also involved was his older brother Alan, 49, who was jailed for four years after a trial last year. A police source described Alan Wright as the head of the family, and he was found to have had four fake crashes within just 10 months. Another family member bought an Audi with 112,000 miles on the clock, staged an accident in it near his home in Burnhope, and when he made a claim after apparently writing it off, its mileage had dropped to 37,000, making it much more valuable. The claimant also falsely claimed to have suffered whiplash, the source said. Investigators used a forensic engineer to prove another crash between a lorry and a car in Burnhope could not have happened as was fraudulently claimed. 'We didn't just come across this activity. It was as a result of our communities telling us that organised crime groups were making their lives difficult,' said Chief Supt Rob Coulson. 'We acted on their information and used intelligence-led policing to take appropriate action as part of a larger operation against organised crime. 'This fraud is affecting every honest law-abiding car insurance holder. It's not just a local issue. We believe this to be a nationwide issue which needs to be tackled robustly. 'In Derwentside car insurance premiums have increased well in excess of the national average, with motorists typically paying an extra £100 a year. Police and fraud investigators identified 261 suspicious accidents handled by two firms (file photo) 'This is an area with limited employment opportunities where many people have to travel out of the area to find work. 'They need their cars, yet they are hit with higher than average car insurance premiums. This is how criminal activity has a real impact on the well-being of a community.' Ben Fletcher, Director of the Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB), said: 'This was part of a major joint investigation by Durham Police and the IFB into an organised scam which could have cost the insurance industry millions of pounds. 'Convictions send a clear message - insurance fraud is not a victimless crime, and the industry, police and justice system will vigorously pursue convictions against those involved. 'Insurance fraud, particularly the 'crash for cash' phenomenon, is anti-social. The criminal gangs organising these scams use the proceeds of insurance fraud to fund other forms of serious crime. By locking the perpetrators up, we minimise genuine threats to our society.'","Wright family from Burnhope, County Durham, at centre of huge fraud .

"A campervan driver said he planned to boycott a court hearing where he was due to fight a speeding ticket - because it would be against his religion. Charles Lawson, 60, was fined £60 by authorities who said he drove at 37mph in a 30mph zone. He was due before magistrates to defend himself today, Christmas Eve, but said he could not because it was the Sabbath of the Ecclesia Bible Church. A major church called Ecclesia was founded in 1949 in Texas, but its leader told MailOnline Mr Lawson is not a member and it does not have holy days at all, let alone on Tuesdays. Unholy row: Charles Lawson insists he cannot attend court to contest a speeding fine because the hearing falls on the Sabbath day of his non-denominational Ecclesia Bible Church, based in Texas . Mr Lawson, from Telford, Shropshire, said he was about 70 miles away when the alleged offence happened in Bontddu, west Wales. He added: 'I was sent photographs supposedly speeding in Bontddu, in the direction of Barmouth. 'According . to them I was travelling at 37mph in a 30mph zone but I can’t agree to . that because my campervan’s speedometer is in kilometres but I’ve been . told that’s no excuse in the eyes of the law. 'I was on the road at that time, yes, but it says I was going in direction of Barmouth. 'At the first court hearing I said I couldn’t admit to have been speeding in the direction of Barmouth as it was a lie.' Heavens above! Mr Lawson with his court summons and a calendar with which he keeps track of the Sabbath . Lead pastor of Ecclesia: Church Without Religion Andrew Farley said Mr Lawson was not a member, adding: 'We have no holy days of any kind. We hold our services on Sundays like nearly any other Christian church' Billed as 'church without religion', a church named Ecclesia was founded in 1949 as is based on the high plains of west Texas, part of America's firmly religious Deep South. Followers believe in a seven-point . 'statement of faith', including the total perfection of the Bible as the . 'verbally inspired word of God and without mistakes as originally . written'. But its lead pastor Dr Andrew Farley, who hosts a nationwide radio show and has written several books about his strand of Christianity, said it could not possibly have been his church. 'Charles Lawson is not a member of Ecclesia: Church Without Religion,' he said. 'The calendar he holds in his hand, in the photo, is not anything that we recognise. 'We have no holy days of any kind, and we hold our services on Sundays like nearly any other Christian church. 'Tuesdays are not special in any way, ever.' Mr Lawson was due today before Mold Magistrates' Court, north Wales, for a date to be fixed for his trial.","Charles Lawson, 60, 'caught doing 37mph in a 30mph zone' in west Wales .

"This is the incredible moment a businesswoman was frantically treated by medics after an out-of-control car ploughed through her garden wall and crushed her. Elena Berek, 46, was cleaning her £10,000 Chrysler Crossfire convertible in her driveway when she was rammed between her two cars after a Volkswagen Golf came off the road at 70mph. The runaway vehicle rammed Miss Berek’s second Chrysler, leaving her wedged between two vehicles in the drive. Rescue: Elena Berek was given a breathing tube as emergency workers desperately tried to save her outside her Coventry home . Crushed: Fireman attached a rope to the wheel of one of Miss Berek's Chryslers to try and pull the cars apart . Miss Berek, who runs a green energy company with her partner Maggie Wilshire, was trapped for an hour while rescue teams battled to free her from the wreckage. Astonishing pictures show medics desperately treating Miss Berek for her injuries following the horror crash which happened outside her Coventry home on Sunday morning. Injured: Miss Berek, who suffered a shattered pelvis and three broken bones in her left leg, runs a green energy business with her partner, Maggie . Police are hunting the driver of the black VW Golf who fled the scene on foot. Miss Berek's partner, 59, who was inside their home at the time of the crash, said: 'I was doing the ironing when I heard this almighty explosion. 'Then all I could hear was Elena screaming my name and then there were bricks flying across the front of the window. 'At first I thought a bomb had gone off, it was terrifying but my only thought was to go to Elena. 'I ran outside and it was carnage - she was pinned between the two cars. 'I ran straight back inside to call 999 and then there were just people everywhere and they were all amazing. 'The police and ambulance arrived within minutes and it was such a fantastic response. 'It must have taken an hour before they managed to free Elena. 'Someone . was saying that a neighbour further down the road heard her scream, so . the driver must have heard it as well. He tried to drive off and to do . that is just shocking.

Operation: Police are searching for the driver after Miss Berek was left with severe injuries . Elena has rushed to Coventry’s University Hospital with three broken bones in her left leg and a shattered pelvis. Yesterday she was undergoing surgery to have pins inserted into her leg. Maggie added: 'She was in a lot of pain, but her spirit is good. It’s a miracle she is alive. 'Seconds before the crash she was at the other side of the car next to the wall. If the car had hit her then she wouldn’t have stood a chance. She’s very lucky.' Miss Berek's brother Tony, 40, was on the phone to her when the crash happened. He said: 'She was on the phone to me and I heard her screams. The Volkswagen veered off the road and knocked over the street sign before it sped towards the garden wall . Debris: The brick wall, which was demolished by the black Golf, lies in the street next to the dented Chrysler . Luxury car: The Chrysler Crossfire owned by Elena Berek which was badly damaged in the crash . 'The Golf had come up Purcell Road at high speed - it must have been about 70mph for the sort of damage it has done. 'My sister was just getting in to her car when the Golf came up on to the grass verge, through the brick wall and smashed in to her car. 'She was stuck in the middle of the two cars. 'The lad in the Golf reversed and tried to drive off, but it was that badly damaged he couldn’t so he just ran off. 'I don’t think it’s hit yet how serious it is or how more serious it could have been. If it wasn’t for the brick wall she could be dead.' West Midlands Police confirmed they were searching for the driver who was described as a white man with black hair in his early 20s.

"Little chef, big price: Kuwati bought the chain for £15million . Little Chef has been gobbled up by Arab investors. The British chain has been sold to Kuwaiti-based Kout Food Group for . around £15million by private equity firm Rcapital, saving 1,000 jobs in . its 81 outlets. The 55-year-old chain was put up for sale in May when Rcapital said it . was ‘resigned’ to losing the name as most bidders would want to rebrand . the chain. Now the London-based firm can afford almost two million of the café’s £7.69 ‘Olympic’ fry ups. Describing its ‘deep affection’ for the chain, Rcapital said it had . managed to secure a future for the brand, whose mascot Fat Charlie . became a popular image on the nation’s A-roads. Little Chef was bought by Rcapital in 2007 after going into administration. Jamie Constable, chief executive of Rcapital, said: ‘Having owned Little . Chef for a long time it feels like we are selling part of ourselves. ‘But we take comfort that the new owners will take the brand to the next . stage.’ It is understood several firms, including British coffee chain . Costa as well as American fast food giants McDonalds and KFC, also bid . for the troubled firm. Rcapital cut about 500 jobs and reduced the number of outlets from 234 to 83. All but two have been sold in the deal. Top chef Heston Blumenthal was also brought in to spice up the menu in 2009, accompanied by a Channel 4 TV documentary. But the three Michelin starred chef was later dropped because some of . his dishes, including braised ox cheek and healthy strawberry, yoghurt . and granola breakfasts, proved unpopular. Managers were also annoyed by . demands such as talking toilets. Saved: The deal means 1,000 jobs in 81 branches across the country could be save- along with the brand's well-known mascot . Kout Foods Group said it ‘had exciting plans to revitalise the Little Chef brand’. Fadwa al-Homaizi, chairman of Kout’s UK arm, said: ‘Little Chef will . benefit from a process of brand renewal in keeping with current trends, . supported by traditional British values.’ Kout owns franchises for Burger King, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell in Kuwait, and has been expanding in the UK. It owns Maison Blanc, the patisserie chain founded by celebrity chef . Raymond Blanc, as well as more than 30 Burger King and eight KFC . franchises. Quintessentially British: The roadside restaurant are best known for their English breakfasts. Customers complained when top chef Heston Blumenthal added granola to the breakfast menu . The Little Chef chain started out as an 11-seat restaurant in Reading in 1958, set up by entrepreneur Sam Alper. Modelled on American diners, it expanded rapidly through the 1970s and 1980s, boasting more than 400 branches at its peak. But it suffered from the rise in motorways, service station food courts and a tired menu.","Deal with Kout food group could save 1,000 jobs across 81 outlets .

"Mrs May gets out of a BMW, one of the cars targeted by high-tech thieves . One in three cars are stolen by high-tech hackers who do not even need the owner’s keys, the Home Secretary will warn today. The sophisticated thieves are an example of the changing threats faced by police in 21st Century Britain, Theresa May will say. She will highlight how gangs can break into a car and programme a new electronic key or use devices to ‘grab’ security coding when the owner uses their fob. Experts are concerned that thieves may even be using computer malware to take over vehicle systems via satellite, issuing remote commands for them to unlock and start up. The latest figures from the Met, Britain’s largest police force, indicate that more than a third of vehicles stolen in the capital are not driven away using a key. Many thefts do not involve any force with thieves instead driving away vehicles in as little as 10 seconds without causing any damage. Mrs May will tell the independent Reform think tank that changing the way police tackle crime will not end at next year’s general election. She will say that the three emergency services are likely to work ever more closely and that further cost cutting is inevitable. Addressing the rise of high-tech car theft gangs, she will say that car manufacturers must work with police to understand the problem. ‘Car thieves might break into a car and programme a new electronic key. They might use sophisticated devices to ‘grab’ the security coding when the owner uses the key so they can use it themselves. ‘And there have been reports that they would even use malware to commandeer vehicle systems via satellites and issue remote demands to unlock doors, disable alarms and start car engines. ‘Because we have this understanding, we can now work with industry to improve electronic resilience … and work out the extent to which the same threat applies to other physical assets such as building security systems.’ Addressing the rise of high-tech car theft gangs, she will say that car manufacturers must work with police to understand the problem . Police suspect tens of thousands of cars are being stolen or broken into every year by thieves using electronic hacking equipment. The trend threatens to destroy years of falling car crime figures as manufacturers create more secure vehicles. Criminals are believed to have used high-tech gadgets originally designed for locksmiths to gain access to vehicles. The most common ruse involves thieves intercepting the signals from key fobs to get into cars or plugging into a car's on-board computer. Modern cars contain about 50 low-powered computers which criminals have learnt to take advantage of to steal vehicles in as little as 10 seconds. Many devices can be bought cheaply online, often from websites based in Bulgaria. They are accompanied by video tutorials posted online. The problem was first exposed several years ago in certain models, but police now suspect that all modern makes are potentially vulnerable. The Met advises car owners to leave their cars in well-lit areas, to consider using steering, gear shift and pedal locks, as well as tracking devices.","Theresa May will highlight how gangs can break into a car and programme a new electronic key .

"A thief jailed for speeding away from a petrol station with the manager clinging onto his bonnet for half a mile has had his driving ban cut in half. Joshua Charnley, 20, put black tape on his number plates and used his Hyundai car 'like a weapon' as he fled the Texaco garage in West Kingsdown, Kent. Lekshmanan Asokkumar confronted the thief and tried to stop him leaving but ended up stuck on his bonnet at he sped away. Scroll down for video . Lekshmanan Asokkumar can be seen clinging to the bonnet of Joshua Charnley's car after he speeds away from the garage in Kent without paying for his petrol . Mr Asokkumar, circled, can be seen approaching Charnley whose car is on the far side of the forecourt . When Mr Asokkumar didn't get out of the way Charnley drove straight at him, lifting him on to the bonnet of his car, before driving off; Mr Asokkumar was eventually flung off on a corner . Charnley repeatedly swerved across the road and tried to punch Mr Asokkumar's hands to get him off his bonnet, before flinging him to the ground as he rounded a corner. Mr Asokkumar, 59, suffered a fractured skull and liver damage during the incident last July and is still recovering. Charnley was jailed for 11 years at Canterbury Crown Court in January and given a 15-year driving ban. But London's Court of Appeal cut the driving ban in half after Charnley claimed the original sentence was 'too harsh'. Judge Deborah Taylor, sitting with Lady Justice Rafferty and Justice William Davis, said Charnley had caused Mr Asokkumar 'severe and traumatic brain injuries'. Joshua Charnley was jailed for 11 years and banned from driving for 15 years, but after an appeal his driving ban has been reduced to eight years . She said his jail term wasn't 'manifestly excessive given the circumstances of the case', but reduced his driving ban to eight years because of his age. Mr Asokkumar's wife Judie, 61, said she thought the original sentence had been appropriate and the reduction was 'ridiculous and disgusting'. She said: 'The whole ordeal has totally destroyed our lives. Lekshmanan is never going to be the same again. 'He only came out of hospital three weeks ago and still needs to have a titanium plate put into his skull at some point to ease some of his pain. 'He has no interest in anything and will never work again. I'm going to be his carer for the rest of his or my life.' Charnley, of Hartley, Kent, a part-time painter and decorator, claimed he 'panicked' and had not intended to drive at his victim as he fled without paying for £37 worth of petrol. He admitted causing serious injury by driving dangerously.","Joshua Charnley left his victim with a head injury over £37 of petrol .

"Cyclists have criticised a new bike lane - for being just 13 feet long. The cycle lane was painted in Beetwell Street in Chesterfield earlier this month. But it has already been slammed by the town's cycling community, some of whom have branded it an 'embarrassment'. Cycle path: Residents have slammed a new cycle path which they say is far too small. They claim the cycle path measures just 13 feet . A bit short! The cycle path in Chesterfield covers just 13 feet, meaning the cyclist has to cycle off the path almost as soon as they have cycled on . Measuring 13 feet, it means the cyclist has to cycle off the path almost immediately after they have got on. Bike commuter Will Jones, 22, said: 'It makes the council a laughing stock really. 'Why on earth would anybody need a cycle lane so short? It's stupid.' Derbyshire County Council, which is in charge of highways for the area, has defended the path. It says the section photographed is part of a larger cycle lane, separated by junctions. But cyclist Lisa Jennings, 36, said: 'It's an embarrassment to the town. The cycle lane was painted in Beetwell Street, Chesterfield, by Derbyshire County Council earlier this month. Many cyclists in the town have criticised the new path, saying there are plenty of other places where paths could have been created . One bike commuter Will Jones, 22, said it made the council look like a 'laughing stock' while another said the council needed to get its priorities straight . 'There are so many dangerous roads which really do need a cycle lane, but don't. 'So to paint this pathetic little lane is just an insult to cyclist who are forced to use genuinely dangerous roads which still don't have a cycle lane. 'The council needs to get its priorities straight.' A spokesman for Derbyshire County Council told MailOnline: 'This is not a four-metre long cycle path - it is part of our Chesterfield town-wide network. 'The photograph makes it look odd because it is a busy part of town and it is intersected by two road junctions. 'We’re keen to promote cycling and make our towns accessible to cyclists. This cycle path is a continuation of a longer cycle path from the A61 Derby Road, through the picturesque Queen’s Park into the town centre.'

"Ann Pewter, 74, was killed alongside her two dogs . A wife and her two dogs drowned in their car after her husband got out to take a photo but hadn't put the handbrake on properly. The car, containing Ann Pewter, 74, and her pets rolled down a slipway into the river Fal in Cornwall. It floated for several minutes, but Mrs Pewter tried to save the dogs rather than leave immediately. David Pewter, 76, who had used the handbrake but only moved it up to the second of six notches, was left watching in horror as the car sank into the river with his wife and the animals inside. The accident took place at the King Harry Ferry crossing, near Trelissick, on March 20 last year. Mr Pewter, a retired electrical engineer, and other bystanders tried to help, but were unable to reach Mrs Pewter. The couple, of Tavistock, Devon had visited St Just in Roseland Church near Truro before the tragic accident, the inquest in Truro, Cornwall, was told. Deputy coroner for Cornwall Mr Barrie van den Berg, recorded a verdict of accidental death, and said that Mrs Pewter died from drowning. Mr Pewter told the hearing: 'We left the church before 4pm and made and began making our way back and drove along the hill and down to the ferry and for some stupid reason I got out of the car. 'I was about to take a picture and to my amazement the car started moving slowly forward and I couldn't catch it. 'The handbrake was on. I put it into gear and I can't think what happened. The next thing I know it rolled slowly down into the water. It kept on rolling. It just floated and then it disappeared.' The inquest heard rescuers dived in to help but could not save Mrs Pewter or the couple's dogs, described by Mr Pewter as 'members of the family'. Garrick Royle, operations manager of the King Harry Ferry, heard the car hit the water from the opposite bank. Rescue attempt: The Mazda Estate can be seen here covered in tarpaulin after it was hoisted up from the bottom of the river . Slipway: The car had slid down as the handbrake had not been applied strongly . He rushed over in a small boat to help, along with mussel diver Matt Vernon. Mr Vernon dived 12 times into the murky water, but was unable to help. Mr Royle said: 'I heard a crash and looked behind me and saw the car I saw it splash, it was quite a big splash. 'I could see the passenger window open and it was floating still quite high. There was a lady in an orange jumper who had climbed back onto the seats. 'I shouted and there was no response. It floated for four minutes before it went down. Operation: Rescue boats and the fire service were dispatched to try and save Mrs Pewter, but they unable to reach her in time . 'The window was open and I was really . confused why she wasn't getting out but it turns out the dogs were in . the back and she was probably trying to get to them.' Selfless: The inquest heard that Mrs Pewter climbed onto the back seat of the car to save her dogs rather than attempting to leave . Craig Jenkins, who was also waiting for the ferry, had parked in front of the couple's car and watched it roll past. He said: 'I saw something in my rear view mirror and I moved forward a few feet. I saw the car go past me and Mr Pewter chasing the car. It then landed in the water. 'I could see the silhouette of a person through the back window leaning towards the back.' Rescue teams from the Navy, coastguard, RNLI, police, fire and ambulance personnel arrived soon after but Mrs Pewter died along with her two dogs. The car was winched back on to the . slipway and rescue workers immediately draped a green tarpaulin over the . vehicle while Mrs Pewter and her pets were recovered. She was later declared dead at Royal Cornwall Hospital at Truro. Mark Richards, a forensic vehicle examiner for Devon and Cornwall Police, inspected the vehicle after it was recovered. He said the car was found turned off with the handbrake applied two out of six notches - not hard enough to hold the vehicle on the sloping slipway. He said: 'The ignition was on the off position and the parking brake was applied two out of six notches. The transmission was in neutral.' Attempts to help: Garrick Royle, left, piloted a boat over to the scene from the opposite bank, while Matt Vernon, right, dived repeatedly into the murky waters in an attempt to save Mrs Pewter . Recording an accidental death deputy coroner for Cornwall Mr Barrie van den Berg, said Mrs Pewter had died from drowning. He said: 'It's clear that what's happened is tragic accident. It rolled into the river and it's understandably affected everyone that was there.' The King Harry Ferry connects St Mawes and the Roseland Peninsula with Feock, Truro and Falmouth and is one of only five chain ferries in England.","Car carrying Ann Pewter, 74, and pets rolled into the river Fal in Cornwall .

"White has overtaken silver as the most popular colour choice of car buyers, sales figures reveal. After more than a decade at the top, prestigious and upwardly mobile silver has given way to cool, classless white. One explanation for the colour’s resurgence has been dubbed the ‘Apple effect’ – referring to iPhones and other gadgets which come in the minimalist colour. Popular: White has overtaken silver as the most popular colour choice of car buyers, new sales figures reveal . The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said that a decade ago, more than a third of new cars (36 per cent) were silver. Last month, however, white was the biggest selling colour – accounting for 22 per cent of new cars – while silver was down the list at 13 per cent, in a tie with blue. Black (19 per cent) was the second most popular colour, followed by grey at 14  per cent. Red – once favoured by boy racers – fails to register in the new figures, despite accounting for 9 per cent of sales in March 2004. Inspirational: One explanation for the colour's resurgence has been dubbed the 'Apple Effect' - referring to iPhones and other gadgets which come in the minimalist colour . Buyers may be considering the resale value of their purchase. Research by car pricing experts CAP Automotive found that white cars typically hold about 5 per cent more of their value than the market average for a typical used car. Sales of new cars accelerated to their highest monthly level for a decade in March, giving Chancellor George Osborne another high-octane reason to smile. Sales were 18 per cent higher than in March last year. Sales were also boosted by demand for the new ‘14’ plate, low interest  rates, competitive finance deals, and windfall PPI payouts to householders who were victims of the banks’ mis- selling scandal. Sales of commercial  vehicles to ‘white van man’ – the small-trader backbone of the economy – are also soaring. The Treasury said the figures were ‘further evidence that the Government’s long-term economic plan is working’. A total of 464,824 new cars were registered last month – the best return since March 2004, when 466,954 sales were  registered. An SMMT spokesman said: ‘People are feeling more confident and deciding to splash out on a new car.’ The top-selling models last month included the Ford Fiesta, Ford Focus, Vauxhall Corsa, Volkswagen Golf, Vauxhall Astra, Nissan Qashqai, Volkswagen Polo, Fiat 500, BMW 3 Series and Toyota Yaris. Market leader Ford said it had chalked up its highest monthly sales since 2008. Decline: A decade ago, more than a third of new cars (36 per cent) were silver.

"When Gary James went to see his Jack Russell in the front garden, he panicked after realising it had escaped through an open gate. The father-of-three frantically searched for his beloved dog, but his neighbour, Gavin Juliette, quickly informed them the pet already been found - trapped in the engine of his car. The 42-year-old had driven 12 miles in his Audi A4 from Ordsall to Swinton in Greater Manchester to pick up his mother-in-law while the dog, called Betty Boop, was stuck under the bonnet. Stuck: The Jack Russell, called Betty Boop, was wedged between the pipework under the bonnet of the Audi A4 . Panic: Gary James, 33, went to search for the dog when he realised he had left the garden gate open . It had managed to find a plastic shelf to sit on for the duration of the journey, but became wedged in the pipework. After Mr Juliette heard barking coming from his car, he called over Mr James for help. The pair took apart the engine as the cowering dog stared back at them, and they managed to rescue it virtually unscathed. Mr James said: 'We just couldn’t believe what had happened and it was even harder to believe how she'd survived. 'It’s a good job Gavin wasn’t going to Blackpool or he’d have probably ended up with a hot dog. 'When I first saw her in there I thought she was bound to be injured or badly burned - but, apart from being covered in oil and a bit shaky, she was fine. 'Now she’s completely back to normal and playing with the children as if nothing happened. I’ll definitely be keeping the front gate locked from now on.'

'It’s not the smallest dog and I still can’t quite work out how it managed to get itself there. It’s absolutely bizarre.

Scroll down for interactive map and video . The interactive map, by Hertfordshire- based Driving Experiences is based upon the World Health Organisation's (WHO) global status report of 2013 on road safety and users can click on 22 locations to view the most dangerous roads. The popularity of the map inspired the adventurous £200,000 mini break . The North Yungas road in Bolivia is widely considered to be the world’s most dangerous route and has even earned the nickname of ‘death road’. The 40-mile stretch of single-track road meanders round cliffs and there are no barriers to protect drivers going in opposite directions from deadly drops. The interactive map, by Hertfordshire- based Driving Experiences is based upon the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) global status report of 2013 on road safety as well as other data sets. Scotland's A726, otherwise known as the old A74 has a fear factor of four out of 10 n the map, which explains that the seven kilometre stretch of road is renowned for head-on collisions. Buyagift.com said that is a UK customer chose the route for their 2-day holiday, it would not cost £200,000 . Each road is rated according to its ‘fear factor’ with the North Yungas scoring 10 out of 10, while Pakistan’s picturesque-sounding Fairy Meadows Road was rated the second scariest because of its ‘treacherous high altitude, unstable and narrow mountain roads.’ Factors such as altitude, safety precautions in place including barriers, local driving techniques, the condition of vehicles, road surfaces, annual road deaths per country and weather conditions were all taken into account when producing the map. Users can click on red explanation marks on the map to explore different deadly routes, where there are also facts about countries’ road rules and scary statistics. From cliff-top single track roads with deadly drops to highways rebound for their bandits, drivers could choose to take on the North Yungas road in Bolivia (pictured) which is widely considered to be the world's most dangerous route . If a driver chose the Trans Siberian Highway, pictured, they could potentially face the rain and uneven surfaces in a sports car - but the company offering the holiday warned that they would have to drive slowly and a vehicle with chunkier tyres would offer a more comfortable ride . The world’s longest road – the Pan-American Highway, which begins in Alaska and passes through countries in South America - is included on the map because of its high temperatures, landslides, impassable sections in wet weather and even livestock in the road. But closer to home, Scotland’s A726, otherwise known as the old A74, has a fear factor of four out of 10. The map explains that the seven kilometre stretch of road is renowned for head-on collisions and has racked up nearly 40 fatalities between 2000 and 2005. A high proportion of the accidents involved pedestrians or cyclists, while one fifth saw vehicles leave the road, which is exceptionally twisty for a dual carriageway and is also busy. Norway’s Trollstigen or ‘troll ladder’ comprises many hairpin bends and sheer drops which get particularly perilous in icy conditions, while Brazil’s Rodovia da Morte puts drivers at risk in a very different way. The ‘highway of death’ is responsible for thousands of deaths every year and is poorly maintained, with gangs and bandits along its long stretch. The map, which lists roads all over the world, was created to highlight the dangers of driving, as although road safety is improving, over 1.2million people are killed in road accidents each year and a further 20 to 50million are injured. It would be impossible to drive the length of the world's longest road - the Pan-American Highway, which begins in Alaska and passes through countries in South America - even in a Bugatti.

"A seatbelt that wakes you up if you are in danger of falling asleep at the wheel is being developed by scientists. The device measures the driver’s heart rate and breathing via a sensor system knitted into the seatbelt and seat cover. If the rates drop too much, a warning alarm goes off. Scroll down for video . If a driver is to feel tired at the wheel, meaning their heart and breathing rate drops, the seatbelt would sound a warning . Jose Solaz of the Biomechanics Institute in Valencia, Spain, where the HARKEN device is being developed, said: ‘The variation in heart and respiratory rate are good indicators of the state of the driver as they are related to fatigue. HARKEN can monitor those variables and therefore warn the driver before the symptoms appear.’ The designers say the system is innovative because it can cancel out the motion of the car and only pick up heart and respiratory rate thanks to the ‘smart textile materials’ embedded in the seat cover and seatbelt. These materials are composed of a combination of fibres and yarns with electrical properties which are mixed with the standard material of the seat and belt. The team say it is a ‘state of the art unobtrusive testing’ and the testing device will be ‘invisible to the user’. According to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, crashes involving driver fatigue are about 50 per cent more likely to result in death or serious injury as they tend to be high speed impacts because a driver who has fallen asleep cannot brake or swerve to avoid or reduce the impact. A ROSPA spokesman said: ‘Sleepiness reduces reaction time, a critical element of safe driving. It also reduces vigilance, alertness and concentration so that the ability to perform attention-based activities, such as driving, is impaired. ‘The speed at which information is processed is also reduced by sleepiness. The quality of decision-making may also be affected.’ Crashes caused by tired drivers are most likely to happen on long journeys on monotonous roads, such as motorways, according to research. Young male drivers, lorry drivers, employees in company cars and shift workers have been found to be most at risk of falling asleep at the wheel. Research shows tiredness among drivers accounts for 20 to 35 per cent of serious accidents and suggests there are more than 6,000 fatalities a year in Europe because of driver fatigue.","Belt can tell if a driver's heart rate or breathing rate drops too much .

"Rhian Jeremiah, 26 of Cardigan, west Wales, who caused £220 of criminal damage on a car by biting it outside a takeaway in Aberystwyth . A woman bit into a car roof after a roadside argument with three strangers on a night out. Rhian Jeremiah, 26, from Cardigan in west Wales, left teethmarks in the bodywork of the white Fiat 500 - and was likened in court to villain Jaws from the James Bond movies. The victims heard a 'crunching sound' when Jeremiah bit the metal of the car, which caused £220 worth of damage. Car owner Selina Day, 23, and her two friends were parked outside of a takeaway restaurant called Lip Licking Chicken at 2am when Jeremiah, who had been drinking, approached. She became aggressive, shouting unintelligibly, and tried to wrench open the passenger door. The occupants then then looked up through the sun roof to see Jeremiah biting the frame above the door. She sank her teeth into the car's frame between the roof and the door and the occupants heard a 'loud metal screeching'. Jeremiah had been drinking at a memorial night for her late boyfriend Simon Jones who drowned off the coast of Aberystwyth, west Wales. Aberystwyth magistrates court heard . that she bit the car she had been retracing his last known movements in . Aberystwyth on what would have been his birthday. Car owner Miss Day told the court: 'She came up to the car and tried to rip the door open. 'I couldn't understand what she was saying - she was very drunk and was abusive.

"Spanish priest: Miguel Pajares died in a Madrid hospital after contracting the Ebola virus in Liberia . The Ebola outbreak ravaging West Africa claimed its first European life yesterday. Spanish priest Miguel Pajares died five days after being airlifted from Liberia to Madrid for expert care. With the death toll climbing above 1,000 and the outbreak showing no signs of slowing, the World Health Organisation declared it ethical to use untested drugs to attempt to control the virus. Mr Pajares, a 75-year-old missionary, caught Ebola – one of the deadliest diseases known to man – while treating patients in Liberia. His condition was described as stable on arrival in Spain and it is thought he was given ZMapp, an experimental drug credited with the ‘miraculous’ recovery of two American aid workers. His body will be cremated today to prevent the virus spreading. Last night, two doses of ZMapp were on their way to Liberia to treat two doctors – the first Africans to receive the drug. The development follows concern that the antibody medicine, which is grown in tobacco plants and has not been formally tested on humans, was being reserved for use on Westerners. The Liberian government said it was aware that the drug’s safety had not been established but that it had no option but to try using it. Scroll down for video . Mr Pajares was working at a hospital in Liberia, which is run by a Catholic humanitarian group he was involved in . The missionary was flown back to Spain for treatment after he tested positive for the deadly virus, which is sweeping West Africa . Information Minister Lewis Brown told the BBC: ‘The alternative to not testing this is death, a certain death. ‘This . is not even the rock and the hard place for us. We think those who have . been infected should be given the chance to have that tested on them if . they give their consent to do so.’ With . no conventional treatment or vaccine available for Ebola, and this . outbreak being the worst ever, interest in ZMapp is high. But production is slow and with only 12 doses made, its US manufacturer says the supply is now exhausted. When the priest first arrived in Madrid,  there were claims he was on a drip and was unable to walk unaided with his condition being described as stable . Speaking before he was flown back he said: 'I'd like to return because we have a very bad experience of what's happened here . A 20-year-old man has made a full recovery after contracting Ebola. Sulaiman Kemokai, from Kenema in Sierra Leone, spent 25 days in a ward. Despite still feeling stiffness in his joints, he claims he is gaining strength every day. Lucky to be alive: Sulaiman Kemokai, 20, has been released from an Ebola treatment centre after recovering . Gaining strength: Sulaiman, from Kenema, Sierra Leone, claims he is getting stronger every day . When he was brought back to Spain last week, a convoy of vehicles escorted him to the King Carlos III hospital for treatment . He was flown back to Europe on a specially adapted plane provided by the Spanish Defence Ministry . Spain's Health Ministry said that it had obtained a course of the U.S.-made drug ZMapp over the weekend to treat the priest . There is anger in Guinea that neighbouring Liberia has managed to secure some of the scarce stock. 'The alternative to not testing this is death, a certain death. This is not even the rock and the hard place for us' Lewis Brown, Liberian Information Minister . Assiatou . Diallo, a nurse in the Guinean capital Conakry, said: ‘The Liberians . can count on their government but Guineans can only count on God in the . face of Ebola.’ Yesterday, . an ethics panel hastily convened by the World Health Organisation said . that the size of the outbreak made the use of untested, and so . potentially dangerous drugs ethical, provided certain conditions are . met. The organisation previously admitted that the disease, which causes internal and external bleeding, is out of control. Health workers carry the body of a man suspected of dying from Ebola and left in the street in Liberia . David Writebol, with his wife Nancy, who has been infected with the Ebola virus. Mr Writebol himself has now been quarantined . In Sierra Leone, patients are staying away from hospital wards, gripped with fear that they will contract the Ebola virus .

"A traffic warden was slammed today for slapping a £70 ticket on a council buggy while it was parked on a roadside verge. Council maintenance worker David Bourner left the two-seater machine beside a flower bed in Tenterden High Street in Kent as he cleaned up leaves. He was stunned when he returned to find a parking fine from Ashford Borough Council on the machine despite it being parked on grass at the side of the road. Crazy: This council buggy was slapped with a £70 parking ticket even though it was parked on the grass . Tenterden Town Council have now written to Ashford Borough Council to contest the decision. Town clerk Hester Deackes said: 'It was rather a shock. The buggy wasn't even on the road. 'It was on the grass verge, but had crossed yellow lines to get there, which was deemed to have been the crime. 'David had temporarily left it to work elsewhere in the High Street and when he came back he found the ticket. He was pretty cross.' Businessman Guy Day, 42, who photographed the ticket on the machine, said: 'What are the traffic wardens thinking about? 'They're giving tickets to each other now. We'd be much better off without them.' His picture sparked a debate on the Tenterden Forum, with people expressing their disbelief. One person said: 'You couldn't make it up'. 'Shock': Council worker David Bourner was stunned when he returned from collecting leaves in Tenterden High Street (pictured) in Kent to find the ticket on the buggy . Another posted: 'I drove past and could not believe what I was seeing. Our local elected borough councillors should without any doubt sort this situation out before Tenterden loses all its trade due to its stupid wardens.' The buggy, used for maintenance work and gardening, is taxed and insured for road use. The £70 fine will be reduced to £35 if it is paid within 14 days. Ashford Borough Council said the buggy broke parking rules because it was driven over yellow lines and left on the verge, but has now agreed to cancel the ticket. A spokesman said: 'We can confirm a penalty charge notice was issued to the vehicle, as it appeared, following a period of observation, that a contravention had occurred. 'We received a representation on this matter from Tenterden Town Council which wehave considered and the notice has now been cancelled.'","Council worker 'shocked' to find £70 penalty on machine he left on grass .

"A brave truck driver saved a diabetic man's life by swerving in front of his runaway car after he had a seizure at the wheel. Father-of-four Bob Rennie, 46, overtook the out of control Peugeot and braked slowly to bring the car to a safe stop. The trucker had followed the car for four minutes before deciding he had to take action to save the elderly motorist. Scroll down for video . Hero truck driver: Bob Rennie, 46, who saved a diabetic driver by overtaking an out of control Peugeot and braking sharply to bring the vehicle to a standstill . As he pursued the runaway driver, Bob shouted down his radio: 'He's all over the road. He's going to kill somebody.' The whole incident was caught on camera by a mobile phone mounted to his lorry's dashboard. Bob, who works for Hebrides Haulage, was . driving south on the A82 near Luss, Dunbartonshire, when the car suddenly began weaving across the road. Footage shows the runaway car weave right then left before hurtling along the verge inches from trees and skimming the safety barrier. It then drifts back towards the white lines before crossing on to the wrong side of the carriageway with cars heading towards it. Bob, from Glasgow, said: 'When I saw someone was in trouble, I just used what means I had to help them,' he said. 'I'm just grateful that the man and his wife went home to their family and nobody was hurt.' Swerve: After driving safely for miles, the motorist suddenly swerves off towards the grassy verge on the A82 in Scotland . Danger: The car heads straight towards bushes and trees by the side of the road as the driver suffers a seizure at the wheel . Accident: The car bumps along the hard shoulder before coming back onto the road in dramatic footage which was caught on camera . He added: 'A couple of miles down the road, I noticed a difference in his driving. Given how careful he had been before, I realised then that something was wrong. 'At first I wondered if he was drunk, but I would have noticed that sooner, so then I thought it must have been a health issue.' Bob said he tried to warn other drivers in an effort to avoid an accident. He said: 'My concern was to make sure no cars overtook and got between me and him and that everybody in the vicinity was safe. 'I was pumping my horn for two reasons, one was to try to get his attention and snap him out of whatever was wrong. 'The other was to warn oncoming drivers there was a problem. I had my hazards on and I was flashing my lights.' Bob finally veered in front of the car when all other efforts to stop it failed. Crash: Bob Rennie sounded his horn to warn other drivers before finally taking action and swerving in front of the out of control vehicle . Danger: With a car coming in the opposite direction, the out of control Peugeot swerves dangerously into the path of an oncoming car on the A82 . He said: 'I don't know if the driver was going in and out of consciousness, but he obviously became aware that something was in front of him and that made him slow down and stop at the side of the road. 'I jumped out and ran right over to him. He was just sitting there as if he was dazed. He wasn't aware of what was happening. 'I gave him some water and a couple of biscuits. Another lorry driver dialled 999 and the police and ambulance arrived.' Seizure: The car ends up on the hard shoulder of the A82 as Bob watches in horror from his truck's cab . Terrifying: Cars head into the path of the out of control vehicle which was swerving all over the A82 in Scotland . The elderly driver - on holiday from Reading, Berkshire, with his wife - was treated at the scene by paramedics. Bob said: 'The paramedics said he had low blood sugar. It was a very, very hot day, which didn't help. 'They were a lovely couple, so nice to speak to. I stayed with them for about an hour. He was still in the ambulance when I left.

"An estimated 290 people were killed in drink-drive accidents in 2012, up by more than a quarter – 26 per cent – compared with the 230 who died in 2011. Road-safety experts said the figures are alarming as they buck the trend of otherwise falling road casualties and point to a hard core of persistent drink-drivers. The figure for 2011 had been the lowest since records began in 1979. The number of deaths on Britain's roads as a result of drink-driving has increased by 25 per cent . The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents called for a lower drink-drive limit and tougher powers for police to carry out random breath tests, which the Government rejects. Critics also blamed cuts in budgets for road safety and anti drink-drive campaigns. Ministers denied accusations that they are complacent over the issue and admitted they are worried by the latest Department for Transport statistics. The 290 drink-drive deaths in 2012 represented around one in six (17 per cent) of all reported road fatalities in the year. Overall there were 250 fatal drink-drive accidents in 2012, compared with 220 in 2011. This is despite the number of accidents involving drink-driving last year falling slightly to 6,680 from the 2011 figure of 6,690. Of those killed in drink-drive accidents, two-thirds (68 per cent) were drivers and riders over the legal alcohol limit. Graph shows how the number of people seriously injured in drink-drive incidents has dropped from 2012 to 2011 . The remaining third (32 per cent) were other road users, involved in the accident but not necessarily over the legal limit themselves. The number seriously injured in drink-drive accidents was 1,210 in 2012, down from 1,270 in 2011. But slight injuries in drink-drive accidents rose to 8,500 last year from 8,420. The Department for Transport said that despite the big increase in deaths in 2012, the number of drink-drive fatalities was still around 25 per cent lower than in 2009 and almost 40 per cent lower than the 2005 to 2009 average. The annual fatality figure has come down considerably since the late 1970s and 1980s when 1,400 or more deaths a year were recorded, and is now around a fifth of that. Graph showing number of drink-drive accidents and casualties a month in 2010 . The figure hovered around the 530 to 580 mark in the first years of this century before dipping sharply over the period 2007 to 2011. Transport Minister Norman Baker said the figures were provisional, but accepted: ‘Any road death is one too many and we are absolutely not complacent when it comes to road safety. We are very concerned about it. We take it very seriously. ‘That is why we are taking forward a package of measures to streamline enforcement against drink-driving, including approving portable evidential breath-testing equipment which will allow for more effective and efficient enforcement.’ He added: ‘Road deaths are thankfully at their lowest since records began in 1926.’ Graph showing the percentage of people reported driving over the legal limit . AA president Edmund King said: ‘Drink-driving is a menace to everyone on our roads and it is very disappointing to see that the estimated number of fatalities as a result of drunk drivers has increased. Behind every statistic is a personal tragedy that could have been avoided for these 290 people. ‘We need to keep reinforcing the message that drinking and driving don’t mix. ‘All drivers need to take heed of this and ensure that if they are going to be driving, that they adopt a zero-tolerance approach and don’t drink anything alcoholic at all.’ The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents called on the Government to lower the drink-drive limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg per 100ml and follow the lead of ministers in Scotland and Northern Ireland, who are pursuing a change to the law which is being resisted in Whitehall.

"Prosecutors said Robbie Gemmell, 17, confessed to his father that he was driving the car when it crashed into a wall, killing his three friends . A teenager whose careless driving caused the deaths of three school friends claimed it was one of the victims who was behind the wheel, a court has heard. Robbie Gemmell,17, originally told police officers that he was a front seat passenger in a Peugeot 205 that crashed on a single track road in near Tyninghame, East Lothian, in November 2013. The accident claimed the lives of Dunbar Grammar School pupils Jenna Barbour,18, David Armstrong,15, and 16-year-old Joshua Stewart. Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard on Tuesday how the quartet were travelling in a Peugeot 206 when it struck a large wall support on a stretch of road known as Limetree near Dunbar. The court heard how accident investigators estimated the Peugeot was travelling at a minimum of 50 to 54 miles per hour in the moments before the collision. David Armstrong had been thrown from the car upon impact and that emergency service workers found his lifeless body 15 metres from the vehicle. Gemmell originally told officers that Jenna - who was due to go travelling in New Zealand in January 2014 - had been driving at the time of the fatal collision, it was said. Prosecution lawyer Graeme Jessop said that Gemmell - who was in hospital recovering from his injuries at the time of his confession - tearfully confessed to his father that he had been the driver. Mr Jessop added: 'The accused became upset and started to cry. His father, Mark Gemmell, asked him if he had something to say and he said ""Dad I was driving the car"". 'The accused and his parents were all in tears and and his father told him to tell them everything. 'He proceeded to do so. Robbie Gemmell told his father that he drove down the road, he didn't specify how far or for how long but that he thought that he was doing around 45mph. 'He remembers being on the road but Jenna having to grab the wheel to straighten them up. 'Robbie remembers pulling the steering wheel back the opposite direction from Jenna and then they suddenly struck a wall.' 18-year-old Jenna Barbour and David Armstrong, 15, both died of their injuries after the accident in East Lothian . He added: 'When he had finished his account, his father said that he would speak to the police about it and that Robbie Gemmell would have to tell them everything he had just told them.' The  story emerged after Gemmell, of  Dunbar, pleaded guilty before Sheriff Gordon Liddle to driving causing the deaths of David Armstrong, Jenna Barbour and Joshua Stewart on November 25 2013 by driving a car without due care and attention at Limetree Walk, near Tyninghame, East Lothian,. After hearing the circumstances of the case, Sheriff Liddle extended his sympathy to everybody who has been involved in the incident. Deferring sentence in order for the court to obtain reports, Sheriff Liddle added: 'I do not want to deal with this case but it is my duty.' Joshua Stewart, 16, died of severe head wounds . Gemmell - who has no previous convictions - wept uncontrollably as Mr Jessop read the circumstances surrounding the case in open court. Members of Gemmell's family and relatives of the deceased also wept as they heard about the causes of the offence from the public benches. Mr Jessop told the court that the car involved in the collision belonged to Jenna Barbour. At some point in the evening, Gemmell took over driving from Miss Barbour. The court heard that at 8.15pm, Gemmell made a 999 call to ambulance control. Mr Jessop said: 'Due to the caller being in a distressed and disorientated state, it took between 15 and 20 minutes to establish the caller's exact location. This caused difficulties and delay in the emergency services tracing the whereabouts of the collision. 'A transcript of the emergency call highlights the distressed state of the accused as he did everything he was asked to do by the emergency call handler in a futile attempt to provide assistance to the injured passengers.' The court heard that the police arrived at the collision scene at 8.55pm. Mr Jessop added: 'About 20.55 hours on the same date, police officers and paramedics arrived at Limetree Walk, Tyninghame, where they observed the accused waving at them. 'They immediately rendered assistance to the accused and checked on the conditions of the passengers. 'It was apparent that the three passengers had all succumbed to their injuries. 'There was only one vehicle involved, a Peugeot 206 registered number Y947 CSH which had struck a large wall support and spun coming to rest approximately 25 metres from the impact point. 'The deceased David Armstrong had been thrown from the vehicle on impact and was lying on a verge approximately 15 metres from the vehicle with severe head trauma. 'Lying parallel to the driver's side of the vehicle was the now deceased Jenna Barbour and the third deceased Joshua Stewart was lying parallel to the rear of the vehicle on the road way, again with severe head trauma. 'They had been removed by the accused under direction of the emergency call handler. 'The impact had caused the engine to detach from the Peugeot and was lying on the nearside verge. 'Various other engine and car parts were scattered over the road surface in an adjoining field. 'At that time Gemmell stated to a police officer and paramedics that he was the front seat passenger of the vehicle and had not been wearing a seat belt at the time of the collision. 'Gemmell was thereafter transferred to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary for treatment. Arrangements were thereafter made to have the families of all three deceased informed of the deaths of their children. Collision: The road to Tyninghame Beach where the car hit the wall. After the impact the car span around and came to rest approximately 25 metres away . 'About 2350 hours, same date police officers attended at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary where they spoke briefly with Gemmell. 'He again stated that he was the front seat passenger at the time of the collision and that David Armstrong and Joshua Stewart were within the rear of the vehicle.

'At round 0100 hours on Tuesday November 26 2013, the undertakers arrived at the locus and it was decided that Jenna Barbour's body would be removed first. 'At this time, it was observed that Jenna Barbour had injuries to the left side of her body and head which would be consistent to her possibly sitting in the passenger seat of the vehicle and not the driver's seat as stated by Gemmell. 'At this time a more detailed search was carried out of the Peugeot motor car which revealed Jenna Barbour's boots jammed within the front passenger foot well of the car while one of the accused's shoes was found jammed in the driver's foot well.' The court heard that in the days following the incident, Gemmell told family and friends that he had been driving the vehicle at the time of the collision. Police arrested him on November 29. He later appeared in court charged with driving offences. Defence solicitor advocate John Scott QC described the incident as an 'unspeakable tragedy.' However, he said he would reserve his mitigation for his client's sentencing hearing.

"Residents in a Devon village claim they have the biggest pothole in the country. They have dubbed the six foot wide pothole ‘the swimming pool’. Around a month ago storms caused the underlying hardcore to be forced up through the tarmac - but the unclassified road remained passable. This 6ft wide pothole in Devon opened after storms forced hardcore up through the surface, and was passable until the local council dug a larger hole to investigate . But then Devon County Council workmen dug a larger hole to investigate the problem - and the road had to be closed. And the council says it does not have the cash to repair the hole until the next financial year at the earliest. And until then the traffic that used the road is being diverted through what were tranquil villages. Central Devon MP Mel Stride has visited the pothole and said: 'This massive pothole is clearly a major problem for local residents as well as for those who are used to taking school buses along this route. Having closed the road the local council now say they don't have the funds to fix the problem . 'I am fully engaged in trying to resolve the situation as soon as possible.' The unclassified road between Crediton and New Buildings carries around 300 vehicles a day including milk tankers from local farms and these are now being diverted through nearby Sandford. Pat Yeo, chairman of Sandford Parish Council, said: “It is causing a lot of anguish in the village, the hole is so big people have started referring to it as ‘the swimming pool’. The county council have not come up with a date when the repairs may be carried out.","Small hole opened in this Devon road after recent storms .

"This picture shows the aftermath of a drink-driver who ploughed into the side of a police car and narrowly missed two officers while they were out on patrol. The two policemen had a lucky escape when a Volkswagen Golf crashed into their car in Dudley, West Midlands in the early hours of Saturday morning. The car was hit with such force the doors were wrenched off. Amazingly, one policeman managed to limp from the wreckage to arrest the suspect. A drink-driver smashed in this police car, causing both doors to be wrenched off. One officer was trapped inside the vehicle but the other managed to escape and arrest the 44-year-old male driver . The second policeman was trapped in the passenger seat at the scene  - but was later freed with the help of firefighters. Both officers were taken to hospital for treatment but neither man's injuries are believed to be serious. West Midlands Police confirmed the 44-year-old driver of the other vehicle was held on suspicion of drink driving. The suspect, from Dudley, has since been released on police bail pending further enquires. The force has also released a picture showing the mangled wreckage of the squad car in the aftermath of the crash - which happened at around 2.40am. The man was driving in a Volkswagen Golf (library image). Police confirmed the 44-year-old was held on suspicion of drink driving, but was released on police bail . Today, Chief Inspector Jack Hadley, West Midland Police's force incident manager, said: 'Both officers were extremely lucky not to suffer more serious injuries. 'They were on a routine patrol when the collision happened. The driver of the other car had lost control of his vehicle and the end result could have been far worse. 'I want to remind everyone to think carefully before getting behind the wheel this weekend - there is absolutely no excuse for driving while drunk. 'If you're planning a night out over the bank holiday weekend think about how you're going to get back and leave your car at home.'","Drink-driver ploughed into a police car in Dudley, West Midlands .

"Cyclists and motorists are well known for their mutual dislike of each other, with both parties accusing the other of hogging the road. And this unfortunate Jaguar driver certainly hasn't helped relations. Cyclists were stunned to see the motorist driving his car on a narrow cycle bridge over a railway line. Tight spot! The unfortunate driver kept apologising and telling cyclists he had made a terrible mistake . Cyclists watched in disbelief as the motorist drove his car over the £2m bridge reserved for pedestrians and cyclists in Cambridge . They heard the £2 million bridge 'creaking and cracking' as the driver squeezed onto the famous covered bike bridge in Cambridge city centre. The man, who was in his late 50s, eventually realised his mistake, profusely apologised, and reversed all the way back down the bridge at the north end of Cambridge station. Cyclist Ruth Platt, 43, did a double-take when she spotted the driver on the way home from her yoga class. She cycled past him, then went back and asked him if he knew what he was doing. 'A lot of cyclists were giving him a really hard time, but he kept saying he was really sorry and had made a terrible mistake,' said Mrs Platt, who photographed the car. 'I could hear a bit of creaking and cracking, so I hope the engineers made the bridge strong enough for a car, as it's much heavier than a bike. 'He wasn't trying to take a short cut, he really had made a big mistake and I actually felt quite sorry for him.' After realising his mistake, the motorist reversed - but not in time to stop the bridge groaning under the weight of the car . The bridge was built 23 years ago and has a red path for cyclists on the left and a slightly raised one for pedestrians on the right. It was designed to be a quick and safe off main-roads-route from the city centre to the south-eastern suburbs of the city for cyclists, so they could avoid cars. The bridge was given a £500,000 face lift seven years ago, when the floor was replaced. Councillor Kevin Blencowe, from the city council, said: 'I think he needs to get his eyes tested. 'How someone can mistake what is clearly a narrow cycle path and footbridge for a road bridge is beyond my imagination. 'I have never heard of this happening before and the bridge has been there for more than 20 years. 'If he had got to the end of the bridge he would have got stuck as the path gets even more narrow and there are bollards to stop cars.'

"When Frank Cattrall damaged his car driving over a pothole, he decided that the council should foot the repair bill. But rather than admit fault, officials said they knew nothing of the hole and said his poor driving must have been to blame. They dismissed the 62-year-old grandfather’s claim that they should pay the £500 bill to fix the wrecked suspension on his Renault Espace. Pothole: Frank Cattrall, 62, stands over the pothole in Colchester, which damaged the suspension on his car . But Mr Cattrall suspected he was being fobbed off and resolved to find out whether the council was telling him the truth. Using . a Freedom of Information request, he found out that a council worker . had reported the 18in by 6in hole during an inspection three months . earlier – but the council had ignored it. The hole was even recorded as a priority case that should be repaired within 28 days, but it was never fixed. He thought that this evidence should be enough to force the council to soften its stance. But . even after Mr Cattrall, a retired BT project manager, told Essex County . Council of his findings, it still refused to pay up – and the . disagreement went to the small claims court. At . a hearing at Colchester County Court, a judge ruled in favour of Mr . Cattrall and ordered the council to refund him £500, plus costs of £115. Victory: Mr Cattrall, pictured, won a £500 payout from Essex County Council after a judge ruled in his favour . Mr . Cattrall, who has been nicknamed ‘Mr Pothole’ by his friends, last . night told the Mail he hopes his win will inspire other drivers to make . claims. His ordeal began when he  struck the unfilled hole around a mile from his home in Colchester one rainy night last April. ‘I . think the council works on the basis that a lot of drivers will just . throw their hands up in despair at all the obstacles which are put in . their way and just forget about it as people just don’t want the . hassle,’ he said. ‘I have . had phone calls and texts saying “well done” since I won the court case . and hopefully more people will now do the same.’ He . said the council had claimed the road was in a ‘reasonable condition – . but I knew different and anybody who had driven on the road knew the . truth’. Mr Cattrall, who is . married to Yvonne, 62 and has three grown-up children, said he would now . try to find out how much money the council spent fighting the case . instead of just paying up. ‘On . the night it happened, it was pitch black and it was raining so the . potholes were full of water – I did not have a chance. I heard the bang . and realised there might be a problem as the car was not right,’ he . said. ‘My garage gave me the bad news that I had a broken suspension arm so it was a major repair job. ‘Had it been a cyclist or motorcyclist who went down into that pothole, they could have  been killed.’ An . Essex County Council spokesman said: ‘We felt we had a valid statutory . defence to the claim, but the court disagreed and found for the . claimant.’ In November last . year, the council faced embarrassment after the councillor responsible . for highways admitted he himself had applied for compensation three . years earlier from the authority after his car hit a pothole. Rodney . Bass, who took up his role in May last year, paid £250 for repairs . after the exhaust clamp broke off his Jaguar XK convertible, but his . claim for compensation was rejected. There . are currently thought to be around 200,000 potholes in need of . attention across British roads but the recent severe wet weather and . freezing conditions are expected to make the problem worse. Insurance . company Warranty Direct this week estimated that the annual repair bill . for damage caused by potholes has increased by 150 per cent in the past . three years to £730million. Damage: Mr Bass had damaged his Jaguar XK, similar to the one pictured . Essex County Council’s highways chief applied for compensation from his own authority after his Jaguar XK convertible hit a pothole - and was refused. Rodney Bass, 67, who took over responsibility for highways in May last year, asked the authority for compensation three years ago when the exhaust clamp broke off his Jaguar XK convertible. He . said: 'I submitted a claim to Essex County Council, but it was rebutted. 'I can empathise with those who do damage their cars, it is very irritating, but it is something we have to live with. 'These things happen and you have to grin and bear it. 'We have to have our eyes open all the time when we are driving.' Mr . Bass has since replaced the car, and said he does not interfere . with the claims procedure as a cabinet member for highways. Rules . state if a road defect has been drawn to the council’s attention, is . classed as severe and has not been repaired, a claim for compensation . can be made for any damage caused. In Mr Bass’s case, the problem had not been reported to County Hall. He . said last November: 'The council’s claims record is very good, or very bad if you are . a driver. Our ability to defend claims is very good, and this means we . are actually inspecting and taking remedial action on severe potholes . quickly. 'If someone has . damaged their vehicle they will know if we have inspected the defect and . how serious it is by whether it has orange paint, which is a priority . and should be dealt with within 28 days, or purple paint, which means it . is less serious.'","Frank Cattrall, 62, said hole in Colchester road broke Renault's suspension .

"The devastated husband of a mother-of-four, who was mowed down as she walked hand-in-hand with her youngest daughter, has slammed the judge who allowed his wife's killer driver to walk free from court. Judge Nicholas Woodward said driver Balbinder Dhillon, 39, was suffering from 'stress' when he ploughed into 42-year-old Donna Davies in Warrington, Cheshire. Dhillon, who has since suffered with 'post accident amnesia', faced 14 years in jail for the offence - but was handed just 300 hours of unpaid work. Guilty: Balbinder Dhillon, from Warrington, who was given a suspended . sentence and community service after pleading guilty to causing death by . dangerous driving. Despite being eligible for up to 14 years in prison, Balbinder walked free from court due to his 'post accident amnesia' After the sentencing today at Warrington Crown Court, Mrs Davies' husband Paul, 44, said he was furious with the sentence - and said he had no faith in the criminal justice system. He said: ‘This just shows how much the British justice system stinks and I have no faith in it whatsoever. 'It’s like giving him a licence to kill. I was half expecting this guy to be awarded a free ticket to Disneyland.’ Mrs Davies was walking with her child after morris dancing practice on April 25, 2013 when the car being driven by Dhillon veered towards them. Mrs Davies threw her child out of the way just in time - but took the full force of the crash. She was catapulted into a nearby garden and died instantly. Robbed: Paul Davies, whose wife Donna was hit by a car as she walked with their youngest daughter, said he feels robbed after her killer driver walked free from court with just 300 hours of community service . In the days before the crash, bankrupt businessman Dhillon had smoked cannabis, taken sleeping tablets and claimed he had blacked out at the wheel of his Audi A4. Mr Davies, from Warrington, said his ‘happy loving family had gone to nothing but a shell’ since the crash. He said: 'It’s a farce when someone who puts a nasty comment on Facebook or Twitter and gets years in jail - yet someone who actually takes somebody else’s life can walk free. There seems to be no logic in it. ‘In fact it sends out a message that people can go out and kill someone and then get away with it by saying they can’t remember doing it. ‘The judge seemed more bothered about the defendant’s life and the devastation it will have on him and his family. ‘Yet all the time I was thinking: ‘what about me?’.' Dhillon, a former director of a landlord and letting agency, was driving home after picking up his two children from kickboxing when the crash took place. The car, which was travelling between 31 and 34 mph, suddenly drifted across the road and hit Mrs Davies before ploughing into a stone wall. Mrs Davies’ daughter was uninjured in the collision. Dhillon, who was treated in hospital after the impact, later claimed he had been under stress due to his wife’s depression and his father’s terminal illness. Happier times: Paul Davies (left), Donna Davies (right) and their son Jonathan 17 years ago. The mother-of-four was mowed down and killed as she walked her youngest daughter home from a dance class . He also admitted to smoking cannabis on the Sunday and had swallowed some of his wife’s sleeping tablets on the Tuesday - two days before the crash on the Thursday. Dhillon of Great Sankey, Warrington, pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving. As well as unpaid work, the defendant was handed a two-year suspended jail term and disqualified from driving for five years. But voluntary worker Mr Davies, who was present in court, said: 'I thought he would go down for at least four years and I was very angry when the sentencing was passed. 'I could feel myself shaking and I had . to get out of the court room quickly. It seemed the judge couldn’t even . look me in the eye. Tributes: Flowers left at the scene of the crash in which Mrs Davies, 42, was killed. Mrs Davies was described as a family orientated-person who was excited about being a grandmother for the first time . 'I felt physically sick. The judge said that, if he committed this man to prison, it would be devastating to his family - but what about my family and the devastation it has caused? 'The legal system hasn’t served us - it appears to have served the offender more. On the night it happened, I was at home and I heard all the sirens going past. I even commented on it but at the time I didn’t think anything of it. 'But when Donna didn’t return home I knew something was wrong - I could feel it. Then I got the dreaded knock on the door and the policeman said my wife had been killed instantly. The news was devastating. Tragic: Scene of the crash where Mrs Davies was killed. The mother-of-four, described as a mother hen, loved baking, walking in the park and taking her children on picnics . 'Donna was about to become a grandmother and it would have been her first grandchild. She was a family-orientated person and like a mother hen. 'She loved the kids and did things like baking and walking in the park and picnics. She was a full-time mother. 'I thought this man’s sentencing would give me closure but it feels like I have been robbed of it instead. I made a promise to get justice for Donna and I’m fighting to get the suspended sentence overturned.' Passing sentence, Judge Woodward told Dhillon: 'You are suffering from post accident amnesia and you have no recollection of the accident itself. 'But, in my judgement, a major factor must have been the amount of stress you must have been under at that time. In particular, the news that you had just been given by your father and, in some way, that must have affected your driving. 'Her (Mrs Davies) family have been absolutely torn apart by what happened and no sentence I give can do anything to remedy that tragedy.'","Balbinder Dhillon, 39, ploughed into mother walking with daughter .

"David Beckham’s crashed £80,000 Audi RS6 which was written off in an accident seven weeks ago has been put on eBay for half the price the former footballer paid for it. The silver Audi was mangled when the former England captain was involved in a crash after picking up eldest son Brooklyn from Arsenal’s training ground at London Colney in Hertfordshire on November 29. Both David, 39, and his 15-year-old son walked away from the crash with minor injuries and were later driven away from the scene in another car. However, the former Manchester United midfielder’s crashed Audi has now appeared on eBay and is listed as an ‘ex-celebrity’ car for £42,995. David Beckham's crashed £80,000 Audi RS6 has appeared on eBay, described as a ‘highly desirable ex-celebrity’ car, for £42,995 (above) after being listed by a scrap dealer based in Halifax, West Yorkshire . The former England captain's silver Audi was deemed a write-off after suffering extensive damage to the driver's side following a crash near Arsenal’s training ground at London Colney, Hertfordshire, in November . The eBay listing, which appears to have been posted by a scrap dealer based in Halifax, West Yorkshire, describes the motor as a ‘highly desirable sports car’. Pictures on the auction-site listing show the dented panelling on the vehicle and the car is described as having ‘damage to the driver wing door and suspension sill’. The listing also claims the car has only covered 3,000 miles, boasts of it being ‘top spec with all the optional extras’ and claims it has ’21 alloys plus much, much more’. It also describes the vehicle as having a roof upgrade, a sound system, diamond cut leather interior and a sat nav. However, it also explains that the car is 'damaged salvage' and describes it as being 'category D repairable'. In insurance terms, a category D vehicle is one that has suffered damage that would cost less to repair than its value. It is thought Beckham's motor was deemed a category D write-off and sold on to the salvage market after suffering extensive damage to the driver’s side in the crash. Both David, 39, and his 15-year-old son Brooklyn (above) walked away from the crash with minor injuries . The car was involved in a collision with what is believed to be a Mitsubishi Colt Coupe Cabriolet. It came as Beckham drove away from Arsenal's training centre having watched his eldest son play for the Under-16s . Pictures on the eBay listing show the dented panelling on the vehicle and the car is described as having ‘damage to the driver wing door’. The listing also claims the car has only covered 3,000 miles and is 'top spec' The former Real Madrid star reportedly suffered a shoulder injury in the crash, which is also believed to have involved a Mitsubishi Colt Coupe Cabriolet, while his son escaped relatively unscathed. The crash came as Beckham drove away from Arsenal's training centre having watched his eldest son play for the club’s Under-16 side against Brighton. At the time, several people took to Twitter to report having witnessed the crash. One Brighton youngster, Archie Davies, wrote: ‘Just seen David Beckham looks like he got in a car crash and hurt his shoulder.’ The teenager later added: ‘Star struck by seeing David Beckham tbh.

"He may not look like your conventional hero. But when a huge traffic jam sent tempers fraying in the weekend heat, it was John Prescott to the rescue. The former deputy prime minister surprised fellow motorists when he jumped from his car and stood in the middle of the road to direct the traffic. Solemnly waving his hands left and right, Lord Prescott – nicknamed Two Jags while in office for having two Jaguars – made an unexpected sight for the drivers of Hull. Hitting the road: John Prescott stunned motorists as he directed traffic for an hour last weekend . Calm head: Despite his fiery temper, Lord Prescott was in good spirits as he helped clear a car park in Hull . Spot the difference: Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott walks around his ministerial Jaguar in 2004 and nine years later on the Tarmac on Humberside . The Labour politician, 75, who last . year lost out on the race to become Humberside’s police and crime . commissioner, joked: ‘I may not be commissioner, but I can be a traffic . cop!’ He had been attending Hull’s Veterans’ Weekend in a local park when he got caught in the jam while leaving a car park. ‘It was a mess,’ he said. ‘Kids were getting uptight in the back of cars and adults were getting angry. ‘So I thought, “There’s only one thing for it”. People were shouting at . me, “Good on you, John!” Within half an hour or so the build-up was . cleared.’ Stop! In the name of Prescott: The peer said people were yelling: 'Good on you John' as he helped deal with a traffic jam . Lord Prescott, 75, allowed half a dozen vehicles at a time to pass through the park gates, before signalling for oncoming traffic to make their way along the road. Honorary Alderman Brian Petch, organiser of the annual two-day event said: 'Every year he's there - he's like a big kid. 'He likes to have a go on all the rides and loves walking around taking everything in and chatting with people.' It was the ninth year Hull's East Park . had hosted Veterans' Weekend, which saw it transformed into a battle . camp, complete with military-themed displays. Directions: Lord Prescott waved to this car while holding back traffic further down this road . A collection of treats for soldiers currently deployed in Afghanistan was held. Captain Dave Mitchell, chairman of the Council of Ex-Servicemen's Association, helped organise the collection. He said: 'The amount donated was fantastic. I'll have enough items to fill 60 to 80 boxes for the lads and girls in Afghanistan'. Lord Prescott said: 'Hull Veterans' Weekend is a superb tribute from Brian and Hull City Council to the veterans.

"Ministers are expected to curb the use of CCTV cameras that 'raise money in industrial volumes' within months . Motorists are hit with £150,000 a day in spot fines from council CCTV cameras, a report reveals. Fixed and vehicle-mounted cameras, often justified on the grounds that they deter crime, are instead being used to fleece motorists, campaigners said. Some 400 town halls gave out £310million of traffic and parking fines in the last five years – equivalent to more than 6.5million tickets, said campaign group Big Brother Watch. It named Camden in North London the worst offender and said the number of councils using CCTV cars had now risen by 90 per cent. However, councils accused the group of 'peddling myths' and said cameras improve safety. Tony Porter, the Surveillance Camera Commissioner, said the use of traffic cameras should fall as councils have to comply with a new code of practice for CCTV. Ministers are expected to curb the use of CCTV cameras that 'raise money in industrial volumes' within months. There are at least 36 local authorities using static CCTV to capture traffic offences and at least 58 local authorities using CCTV cars, Big Brother Watch found. The number of local authorities using CCTV cars has increased by 87 per cent since 2009. MP Nick de Bois, who wrote the report's foreword, said: 'CCTV should only ever be used in exceptional circumstances, and therefore I agree with the Government that local authority use of CCTV for parking enforcement should be banned.' London boroughs accounted for around 90 per cent, or £285 million, of revenues raised through CCTV cameras, Big Brother Watch said. The top five highest revenue-raising councils were Camden, Ealing, Lambeth, Westminster and Harrow. A Surveillance Camera Code of Practice, published by the Government, highlights the need to use CCTV for traffic offences 'sparingly', the campaigners said. London boroughs accounted for around 90 per cent, or £285 million, of revenues raised through CCTV cameras, Big Brother Watch said . The report also highlights that some tickets may be potentially illegal, in circumstances where they have been issued by a traffic warden in a CCTV control room without the proper legal process being followed under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act for directed surveillance. Emma Carr, deputy director of Big Brother Watch, said: 'The Government rightly wants to reign in this unjustified surveillance, so councils are turning to desperate arguments about public safety to justify their cameras, despite having absolutely no evidence to back up their claims. 'The use of CCTV and spy cars for parking enforcement should be banned. The fact that no councils publish proper statistics about how these cameras are used highlights that many know that their CCTV operation is about raising money, not about public safety. A parking enforcement car at London's Kings Cross . 'The Government should urgently investigate whether or not the use of cameras to snoop on motorists breaches surveillance laws, particularly where a traffic warden sits in a control room looking for motorists to ticket.' Brandon Lewis, Minister for Local Government, said: 'It is clear that CCTV is being used to raise money in industrial volumes for town halls, breaking the constitutional principle that fines should not be used as a source of revenue. 'Unreasonable parking charges and fines push up hard-working people's cost of living. If parking is too expensive or difficult, shoppers will drive to out of town supermarkets or just shop online, undermining the vitality of town centres and leading to 'ghost town' high streets. Councillor Peter Box, chair of the Local Government Association's Economy and Transport Board, said: 'It is frustratingly familiar to hear Big Brother Watch again peddling the myth that councils are enforcing parking regulations just to raise money. 'However, it is wholly inaccurate and misleading for them to claim councils are alone in warning about the dangers of banning the use of CCTV for parking enforcement. 'Road safety campaigners, schools, disability and pedestrian charities and councils have all come together to warn the Government that banning CCTV parking enforcement will put school children and disabled pedestrians at risk and worsen road safety.'","Authorities gave out £310m in fines over last five years .

Coach operator owner John Henderson was amazed when one of his drivers was fined for driving a bus in a bus lane. Glasgow City Council has since realised the mistake and cancelled the charge . The number 329 bus was 'caught' on the morning of February 5 as it drove along Cathedral Street, when a council CCTV cameras snapped the registration plate. John, 57, from Blantyre, South Lanarkshire, said he and his wife Linda were 'speechless' at the fine. He said: 'It is sheer stupidity that a bus can be fined for driving in a bus lane. This was a proper bus. 'It's a small to medium sized bus with 27 seats - but it's still a bus. It's an over-zealous attack by the council.' Cathedral Street has been revealed as the second most prolific money-generating street in Glasgow after a council crackdown on the illegal use of bus lanes. More than £500,000 in fines has been made after almost 20,000 motorists were caught driving in the bus lane between April 23 - when the council launched its CCTV crackdown on bus lanes - and December 31 last year. The city's biggest cash generator is Glassford Street's bus lane, which has netted around 28,000 drivers, allowing the council to rake in nearly £700,000 from fines. Round the bend: The image (left) that was used as evidence by Glasgow City Council shows the bus in the bus lane. The bill for £60 (right) John, who has owned the company for 30 years, accused council bosses of using the lanes as a way of raking in cash. He said: 'This has reinforced to me that bus lanes are one big money-making exercise. 'This has nothing to do with trying to keep traffic running smoothly, which is what bus lanes are meant for.' A Glasgow City Council spokesman said the fine was sent out in error. He said: 'Another vehicle was in the lane behind the bus lane and it was included in the picture taken by the bus lane camera. 'A notice was sent out by mistake and it has now been cancelled.'","Bus company owner was 'speechless' when he saw the penalty charge .

"A radio presenter in New Zealand has landed in hot water after referring to women weighing 72kg (158 lbs) as ‘heifers’ and ‘a bunch of lardos’ on-air, when she thought her microphone was switched off. Rachel Smalley, 42, made the comments after discussing a story on-air that said a popular contraceptive pill was less effective when taken by women who weighed more than 70kg (154lbs). The breakfast radio programme reported on Wednesday that the average weight of New Zealand women was 72kg – though according to Bloomberg it is 74.6kg – and therefore the pill was ineffective for most of the female population. Scroll down for video . Radio host Rachel Smalley committed a huge on-air gaffe when she said that women weighing 72kg (158lbs) were 'heifers' and 'a bunch of lardos' The show then went to an ad break, but the presenters’ microphones were left on and Smalley could be heard over the top of the advertisement voicing her horror at the plumpness of her fellow countrywomen. ‘The average woman is 72kg?’ Smalley said incredulously. ‘Heifers! Considering the average height’s, what, 5’6? Lardos, bunch of lardos.’ The presenter later apologised for her on-air gaffe. ‘I deeply regret the comments. They were offensive,’ Ms Smalley said. ‘I left my microphone on and a conversation meant for off-air, went on-air and the audience only heard one side of that conversation. ‘That said, my comments were offensive. I'm sorry. It was a genuine mistake.’ Twitter was abuzz after the comments. ‘I'm a 'lardo' and Im owning it...’ tweeted ZM colleague Polly Gillespie. Jay-Jay Feeney, another radio presenter posted: ‘I weigh a bit over 72kgs.

"Computerised lorry convoys which are controlled by just one driver are set to be tested on British roads next year. The lorries would be  electronically linked together, meaning the driver of the front vehicle could control the acceleration, braking and steering of  the others. It would allow whole ‘road trains’ of lorries to travel long distances on motorways with only a few yards between  each vehicle. Scroll down for video . The Mercedes-Benz Future Truck 2025 prototype, pictured on a German Autobahn during a trial last month. It is a major step in an escalating race to develop self-driving vehicles, like those set to be introduced to Britain . During the trial, trucker Hans Luft was relaxing with his hands behind his head while at the wheel of his 40-tonne heavy goods vehicle. Similar technology is expected to be tested in Britain next year . While the other lorries in the line . would still have dedicated drivers, the automated system would allow . them to ‘switch off’ for most of the journey. In . an emergency, or at busy junctions, the drivers of  the follow-on . lorries would  be able to retake control of  their vehicles. Backers . of the proposal say the system would allow drivers to use their laptop, . read  a book or ‘sit back and enjoy a relaxed lunch’. They also say . platoons would cut down on road congestion and cut  fuel consumption by . about  10 per cent. The fuel . efficiency – and therefore lower running cost – of the lorry convoy is . due to the reduced aerodynamic drag caused by its streamlined formation. But . motoring organisations criticised the idea, warning the convoys may . intimidate other drivers and block cars from entering and exiting . motorways. Tests are due to be held on tracks in Britain, and if  successful could be extended to quieter motorways at  night time. The 'road trains' of lorries have been announced after it emerged last month that driverless cars, like the ones pictured, could be driving on British roads as of next year . Further . trials would then be carried out on motorways which are heavily . congested to test how well the automated system works in practice. The . vehicles would communicate via wi-fi, so that if the lead vehicle . changes speed, the others follow suit. In addition, the movements of the . entire convoy would be monitored by laser sensors and infrared cameras. News of the British tests . comes after Daimler announced last month that it had run an autonomously . driven truck on a closed section of the German autobahn. Swedish . lorry maker Scania has also been testing platoons on Swedish roads . since 2012. This latest plan, devised by the Department for Transport, . follows a trip by officials to Sweden to study the system. Their . report concluded that similar trials in Britain would be feasible and . ministers are expected to give the green light for them to start next . year. Earlier this month it was revealed that Google has begun lobbying the state of California to allow it to test driverless motorbikes, like the one pictured, and trucks on its roads . A government source . told the Sunday Times: ‘There are potential benefits, notably reduced . costs for haulage firms and reduced congestion for motorists, so there . is sense in looking into it. ‘Equally we have to be cautious and ensure that safety isn’t compromised in any way.’ Paul . Watters, head of roads and transport policy at the AA, said: ‘It’s a . complicated one and road users will naturally have concerns about it. ‘If the lorries are following each other closely, it might be hard to spot the road signs on the near side of the motorway. ‘Putting it into practice would mean a complete re-design of the signage system. ‘It would also make exit  and entry very difficult on motorways, so the convoys would have to separate at every junction. ‘These ideas always need to be looked at, but at this stage I can see some pitfalls. ‘Motorways are the safest roads we have, and we wouldn’t want to do anything to jeopardise that.’","Lead driver of the convoy would control braking, acceleration and steering .

"A car mechanic who posted videos online of himself driving erratically at terrifying speeds has been jailed for causing the death of a teenage girl and injuring four others. Martin Li, from Hexham, Northumberland, admitted killing 18-year-old Lucy Duggan in a head on crash as he raced his turbo charged Ford Focus while high on cannabis. The chilling series of dash-cam videos, filmed in the weeks leading up to the crash, show Li driving at terrifying speeds along country roads, some with accompanying messages that reveal a bitter contempt for other drivers, pedestrians and cyclists. In the hours before the accident, the 22-year-old collected Ms Duggan, along with friends Alex Crowe and Lauren Jewitt, after agreeing to give them a lift to nearby Corbridge on August 25. But he began to drive at excessive speeds, in a car he had only gained insurance for after lying about his age. Scroll down for video . Jailed: Martin Li (left), from Hexham, Northumberland, admitted killing 18-year-old Lucy Duggan (right) in a head on crash as he raced his turbo charged car while high on cannabis . 'New motor': Weeks before the accident, Li was handed the keys to his 150mph Ford Focus ST before posting a picture of himself with the car alongside the words: 'New motor :).' Newcastle Crown Court heard that before the crash, the girls in the car had begun to scream for him to stop as they said he reached speeds of 130mph. Paul Rowland, prosecuting, said he had floored the accelerator, at one point overtaking two vehicles in a single manoeuvre, and said the bends were his 'favourite bit'. Danger: Before the accident, Li posted a number of hair-raising dash-cam videos in which he is seen driving at excessive speeds and dangerously close to other cars on narrow country roads . Stupid: This still from one of his videos shows him speeding past a marked police car . He added: 'According to friends and witnesses he is a fast driver. He had in fact posted videos on You tube which does in fact demonstrate this. 'On the day of the accident the defendant was driving at greatly excessive speed. 'He paid no attention to the road markings and he had personal knowledge of the road so he should have been aware of the dangers.' As they approached a sharp left turn over a bridge, he crossed over to the other side of the road in an attempt to straighten out the bend. But on returning to the correct side of the road, the car began to skid across the carriageway and smashed into an oncoming vehicle. Li emerged from the car 'virtually unscathed' but Ms Duggan was left with fatal internal injuries. 'Be warned, cyclists!' One of his Facebook posts reveals a bitter contempt for cyclists . 'Guna go twice as fast tomorro!!' He also posted a string of Facebook messages boasting about his fast driving . The other two passengers and the mother and daughter in the other car were all seriously injured. Pleading guilty to a charge of causing death by dangerous driving in August, Li also admitted four counts of causing injury by dangerous driving as well as making false statements to obtain insurance. Mr Rowland said Li had smoked cannabis with Crowe, one of the passengers in the car, before the fatal crash. Mr Rowland said: 'They drove his vehicle into Hexham to pick up his mother before returning home. 'Mr Li and Alex Crowe both shared a joint of cannabis in his garage about 4.30pm. 'About 7pm they picked up Lauren and Lucy. They agreed to pay five pounds petrol money to Mr Li to take them through to Corbridge.' Carnage: As Li sped through the Northumberland countryside, the car began to skid across the carriageway and smashed into an oncoming vehicle . Robert Patton, defending, said: 'He has never tried to minimise the harm he has caused to the family. 'His mental health has deteriorated. He appears to be punishing himself mentally, he is unable to sleep. He is a quiet and extremely lonely person. He lives his life for his family.' Weeks before the accident, Li was handed the keys to his 150mph Ford Focus ST before posting a picture of himself with the car alongside the words: 'New motor :).' Thereafter, he posted a number of hair-raising dash-cam videos in which he is seen driving at excessive speeds and dangerously close to other cars, Sky Tyne and Wear reported. In one, he drives terrifyingly close to a motorbike carrying a pillion . passenger on a road just outside Alston, before overtaking on a hairpin . bend. Chillingly, his friends even warn him of the dangers of driving too fast, telling him to slow down to avoid a serious accident. 'No words': The judge told li he had 'blighted the lives' of Lucy's friends, especially her that of her father . Foreboding: Chillingly, his friends even warn him of the high speeds he reaches, telling him to slow down to avoid causing a serious accident . Concern: Another friend warns Li of the consequences of driving too fast . Four weeks before the fatal crash, he described on Facon Facebook: 'do 1 ya stupid old hag, guna go twice as fast tomorro!' And in another he revealed his contempt for cyclists sharing the road. 'F****** cyclists riding on the roads be warned, I will come passed you as close and as fast as I can,' he ranted. 'Don’t like it? Get on the f****** path!' Sentencing Li to eight years in jail, Judge John Evans said the speed he was doing and the nature of the road made a collision inevitable. He said the police had found videos online in which he had been driving extremely fast and that speeding was something he craved. 'You have blighted their lives and in particular that of Lucy’s father,' he said. 'No sentence I can possibly impose today can begin to compensate them for the loss of their loved one who will occupy their thoughts indefinitely. 'You killed someone needlessly and selfishly and if it haunts you for the rest of your life no one will shed a tear or deem it fitting.' Imposing a driving ban of ten years, Judge Evans said he had wrought appalling devastation on five families, including his own. A statement released today from Lucy Duggan's family - parents Ralph and Barbara and brother Jack - said: 'The devastating accident that took our wonderful daughter from us on Sunday, August 25, has rocked our world and shattered so many precious dreams. 'Lucy loved life and lived it to the full, her constant smile brought sunshine into the lives of all she met. 'She lived her life in full confidence that everything would be OK and we have tried to draw from her positive outlook to get us through. 'The support that our family, friends and the wonderful community we live in have shown us has been amazing and given us great strength. Lucy was always there when we needed support and we have been left feeling helpless without her. 'May the sunshine in her outlook of life give us all strength to carry on without her'.","Martin Li, 22, admitted killing 18-year-old Lucy Duggan in a head on crash .

"This is the astonishing moment a lorry driver overturned his vehicle on a busy roundabout spilling 20 tons of waste across the road before crashing the HGV into the side of a house just 90 minutes later. The driver's unfortunate morning began just after 9am on Saturday when his vehicle flipped onto its side on a roundabout in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, leaving tons of industrial waste strewn across the carriageway. Police and two fire engines attended the scene and the emergency services managed to get the vehicle back on its wheels – only for it to career out of control and smash into a house. Scroll down for video . The first crash saw the HGV overturn onto its side and spill 20 tons of waste across a roundabout in Cross Heath, Staffordshire. Police and fire crews were able to clear the waste before getting the vehicle back upright . The fire service had left the scene just after 10.30am following the first incident but within 30 minutes had been called out again after the same HGV ploughed into a house. A Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: 'The original call was at 9.09am to Liverpool Road in Cross Heath in Newcastle-under-Lyme for a road traffic collision where 20 tons of general waste had spilled from a HGV on its side. 'A large amount of fuel was also spilt. We sent two fire engines to the scene, each with a crew of five crew members. 'We left the scene at 10.32am with police still in attendance, but no one was trapped in the vehicle. 'Then we received another call at 10.58am. The vehicle from the previous incident had been righted and then careered into the front of a semi-detached property. 'The same two fire engines had to return to that scene. A building surveyor was also requested.' No one is thought to have been seriously injured in either incident and it is believed the house was empty at the time of the crash. Cliff Beeton, from Tunstall, in Stoke-on-Trent, spotted the lorry's cab embedded in the front of the property as he ventured out to get a fish and chips supper. The 58-year-old said: 'It must have happened when the recovery people lifted the lorry's cab back up. However, just 90 minutes after the first crash, the lorry ploughed into the front of a nearby house (above). No one was injured in the crash but emergency crews were called out again, having only just left the scene . 'I don't know if someone forgot to put the handbrake on but it seems it rolled off and hit the home while their backs were turned. 'I believe the house is empty at the moment, which is a relief, but the owner's going to be in for a shock when they find out. The cab is completely embedded in the wall. 'My wife had seen all the rubbish strewn across the road earlier in the day and she couldn't believe it when I told what had happened. 'I was only going to get a chippy dinner and you don't expect to see something like that.'

Fail: one determined Londoner still hasn't passed after flunking the test 107 times . Once you’ve passed both parts of the theory, there’s still the practical to overcome. One determined 40-year-old logged a record number of practical driving tests – passing on his 37th attempt. The unnamed man, from Stoke-on-Trent, forked out at least £2,294 trying to pass – which could have paid for a reasonable second-hand car. The practical test costs £62 to take on a weekday or £75 for a test on an evening, weekend or bank holiday. An AA Driving School spokesman said: ‘This is an unusually high number of test attempts, but it is important to remember that everyone learns at their own pace.

"Banned: Former BBC Radio 2 DJ Sarah Kennedy has been banned from getting behind the wheel after ploughing her Mercedes into a parked car while drink-driving . Former BBC Radio 2 DJ Sarah Kennedy has been banned from getting behind the wheel after ploughing her Mercedes into a parked car while drink-driving. Despite claiming she lost control of the car when she sneezed, the 63-year-old was more than . two-and-a-half times the legal limit when police tested her breath after she crashed her £50,000 luxury Mercedes Benz SLK. When police arrived at her Northamptonshire home and tested her breath following the incident, Kennedy’s breathalyser reading was 92 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath compared to the legal limit of 35mcg. Kennedy admitted a charge of driving with excess alcohol when she appeared at Northampton Magistrates’ Court yesterday. Bizarrely, she claimed she crashed because she suffered a sneezing fit at the wheel after driving past a field of rapeseed which had aggravated her hay fever prior to the collision on April 3. Prosecutor Vicki Walker told the court Kennedy was driving along the A361 near Byfield, Northamptonshire, when she crashed into a car which was parked on the verge with its hazard lights on. 'The road was fairly straight and had no obstructions,' Ms Walker said. 'The occupants of the parked vehicle reported the defendant was unsteady on her feet when she got out of her vehicle.' After the crash Kennedy offered to leave her telephone number but then drove off when the vehicle’s occupants told her they were going to call the police and she felt threatened, the court was told. Ms Walker said officers attended . Kennedy’s home shortly afterwards and she told them she had . drunk two glasses of wine since she had got home. Sarah Colby, defending, said Kennedy was 'extremely remorseful' for what had happened and said it was totally out of character. Crash: Kennedy had been driving her Mercedes Benz SLK, similar to this model, when she hit a car parked on the verge . Ms Colby said: 'My client has had a driving licence since she was 17 years old and has never had any issue like this before. 'My client had been suffering lower back pain earlier in the day before a flight and her friend had advised her to drink two glasses of wine to loosen up the muscles before she boarded the plane. 'She then had two more glasses of wine on the flight and had then taken a train to London.' Ms Colby said the drinks had been spaced out over a long period and her client had 'never dreamed' she would be over the limit. Career: DJ Kennedy started her career at the British Forces Broadcasting Service (pictured), before joining Radio 2 . She added: 'She decided to drive back to her home in Northants as she was missing her husband and wanted to get back home as she was worried her back would feel worse in the morning. “Mrs Kennedy, who suffers from hayfever, was driving with the windows open past a field full of rapeseed when she suffered a sneezing fit. 'She was reaching for a tissue but before she knew it she had crashed into the parked car. 'When she got out of the car her back was giving her pain. She was in shock, they were in shock. 'She apologised for what had happened and offered to hand over her telephone number.' Ms Colby said Kennedy decided to drive off because the victim’s partner had sworn at her. The . solicitor said her client had drunk three glasses of rose wine when she . had got home and could have used this as an excuse for being over the . limit but fully accepted that she would have been over the limit when . she was driving. Bench chairman Brenda Foster said: 'It was an unfortunate incident and the level of alcohol in breath was high. 'We . have dealt with it with a slightly lower penalty because we accept the . wine she drunk at home would have pushed the alcohol reading up.' Kennedy, . who was given an MBE in 2005 for services to broadcasting, described . herself in court as retired and able to pay a financial penalty. She was fined £400 and ordered to pay . costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £40. She was also banned from . driving for 22 months. The . former DJ quit the Radio 2 breakfast show in 2010 following a string of . on-air outbursts and slurring her words during her programme. She refused to comment outside court. Presenter: Kennedy was a regular on television screens and presented ITV show Busman's Holiday in 1990 . Radio and television presenter Sarah . Kennedy is best known for her stint on early morning BBC Radio 2 show . The Dawn Patrol, which she fronted from 1993 until September 2010. Nicknamed . Bunty Bagshawe, Kennedy began her career with British Forces . Broadcasting Service, before starting at Radio 2 in 1976. She also hosted ITV television show Game For A Laugh between 1981 and 1984, and Busman's Holiday. She was awarded an MBE for services to broadcasting in 2005, although her career has not been without controversy. While . standing in for Terry Wogan in May 1999, she drew attention for . calling fellow presenter Ken Bruce an 'old fool', and addressed a . reverend who was a guest on the show as 'an old prune'. She said her . behaviour . had been down to a lack of sleep the previous night. In . 2000, she had to apologise for suggesting that black people made good . athletes because they were used to running away from lions. During . a show in August 2007 concerns were raised over her slurred speech, . although she said this was down to a sore throat. Although she presented the following . day's show, she then took a month off work with pneumonia. In . October 2007 she was warned by bosses after during piece on wearing . visible clothing while on the roads in winter she joked she had almost . run over a black pedestrian because she could not see him in the dark. 'It’s lucky he opened his mouth to yawn or something and I saw him,' she . had said. The BBC apologised for the comment. Her . Dawn Patrol show had around 4.5million listeners but in September 2010, . after she was absent for several weeks, it was announced she was to . leave the programme, without saying goodbye to her listeners. Prior . to her departure her show start time was moved from 6am to 5am, and . listeners had raised concerns that her health was being affected by the . early starts, with allegations that she had appeared on air drunk. However, she has publicly denied these rumours – insisting she drank only orange juice or water before her early morning show. She also said she had come to the decision to leave her show while on holiday that August, following the departure of Terry Wogan earlier that year. ‘The rumours about me became self-perpetuating and built up into a ridiculous urban myth,' she told the Mail On Sunday in an interview published in October 2007, a month after her resignation. She added: 'Even if I was drinking, how could I go to bed at 7pm and then be drunk . on the radio the following morning? I have never been anything other . than sober at work and I can’t understand why people would tell such . hideous lies about me.’","Kennedy, 63, was more than two-and-a-half times the legal limit .

"It prides itself on being ‘the fourth emergency service’ – but the AA had to turn to arch rivals the RAC for a tow after one of its cars broke down. This AA Driving School car got a puncture during a driving lesson at Bonnyrigg, near Edinburgh, and was left stranded because it did not have a spare wheel. An appeal for help to the AA’s own breakdown service was rejected for an unknown reason, but the company that leased the Ford Focus to the AA was covered by the RAC and so the RAC’s breakdown staff were called in to tow it to a garage for a tyre change.

"A pensioner and his wife were both caught drink driving at the same time after he drove to her aid after she was involved in a minor car crash, a court heard. Charles Fitch, 75, got behind the wheel while over the limit after police phoned him and said his wife Kathryn Mason had been in a crash. As he made his way to the scene, officers breathalysed Mrs Mason and found she was twice the drink-drive limit after an evening at the social club. Drink drivers: Charles Fitch, 75, and his wife Kathryn Mason, 59, both admitted drink driving when they appeared before magistrates in Bournemouth . When Mr Fitch arrived police smelt alcohol on his breath - and they discovered he was also nearly twice the limit. The pensioner admitted he had drunk 'a couple of whiskies' at home that evening. They were both arrested and taken to the same police station. The couple appeared at the same magistrates’ court on the same day and both pleaded guilty to driving with excess alcohol. Mr Fitch, a retired director of an aerospace engineering company, was banned from driving for 12 months and his wife was disqualified for 17 months. The couple live in a £350,000 thatched cottage in Poulner, near Ringwood, Hampshire. After the case Mrs Mason, 59, said: 'I was in the car and I can’t really remember what happened but I had a blow-out or something like that. 'Charles got a crackly phone call saying I had been in an accident and he got in his car. 'I’m sure if he had stopped to think for a moment as he had had a few drinks he wouldn’t have done it. Drink drivers: Kathryn Mason (left) was involved in a minor crash on her way home from the social club while over the drink-drive limit. Her husband Charles Fitch (right) went out looking for her while he was also over the limit after having 'a couple of whiskies' at home . Home: The couple, who live in a thatched cottage, were both banned from driving after admitting being over the limit . 'But if I was able to make a phone call perhaps it wouldn’t have happened. Thankfully there wasn’t anybody else involved in the accident.' Magistrates in Bournemouth heard that Mrs Mason had spent the evening of December 14 last year at a social club. She got into her black Peugeot 207 to drive home but crashed in West Moors, Dorset, at about 9pm. Mr Fitch went to look for her ‘slowly and carefully’ in his Vauxhall Astra but was breathalysed by police when he found the scene. Mr Fitch’s breath test had a reading of 62 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - the legal limit is 35mg. His wife had a reading of 74mg which is just over twice the legal limit. He was fined £400 and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £40 victim surcharge. Mrs Mason was fined £350 pounds and told to pay costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £35. The couple were arrested as part of a pre-Christmas crackdown on drink drivers by Dorset Police.","Charles Fitch, 75, went looking for his wife after she had a crash .

"When a policeman noticed driver Sophie Vaughan sipping a Slush Puppie in a traffic jam, he could have let her off with a simple lecture on road safety. But instead he handed her a £100 fine and three penalty points – after calling three  colleagues on his radio for back-up. Account manager Miss Vaughan, 22, was on her way to lunch with a friend in Carshalton, South London, when she got stuck in a traffic jam. Pulled over: Ms Vaughan was driving her convertible Ford Ka at 11.30am last Friday when she sipped the drink . She took a sip of her raspberry Slush Puppie drink while she was waiting, and thought nothing of it. But a policeman passing on a bike spotted her and called in three more officers – one on a bike and two in a van. He then gave her a £100 fixed penalty fine for driving without due care and attention. Miss Vaughan, from Wallington, South London, said: ‘It’s so petty and ridiculous. It was only a tiny sip. I wasn’t even moving. ‘I’m outraged. And talk about overkill – to have four police officers dealing with such a petty thing is a joke.’ After having been a driver for four years without so much as a parking fine, Miss Vaughan was nabbed with the ice drink in her Ford Ka convertible at 11.30am last Friday. She vowed to appeal after also getting three penalty points on her previously clean licence. A . spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: ‘Any person who believes . they have been unjustly issued with a fixed penalty notice has the right . to appeal against this through the courts.’ The law does not specify whether eating or drinking while driving is illegal, and whether drivers have committed by doing so depends on how it affected their driving. According to advice from the RAC, drinking a soft drink while on the road is only an offence 'if you present a significant danger' and if the police think 'you are not in proper control of the vehicle. A study from Leeds University has shown that drivers consuming drinks at the wheel went 22 per cent more slowly than average, but were also 18 per cent more likely to show erratic lane control. Guidelines published by the CPS do not mention food or drink in relation to driving without due care and attention - but they mention that any act which causes a driver to be 'avoidably distracted' could constitute an offence. This is in contrast to more specific laws which exist around other potential distractions such as mobile phones - the use of which attracts an instant penalty.","Sophie Vaughan, 22, was still in South London traffic when she took a sip .

"A woman has been pictured apparently driving at more than 70mph on a motorway – while holding an iPad in front of the wheel.

It was put on as a personal joke.’ But another eagle-eyed user of the social networking site commented: ‘You can see the speedo in the pictures.’ The speedometer appears to be between 70mph and 80mph in the photograph, which has since been taken down from the site.

She said: ‘The iPad wasn’t in use, it was just being handed over. ‘If I was on my phone and you could see I was using it, it would be a bit different.’ Using hand-held phones and similar devices, such as tablets, while driving is illegal, even when stopped at traffic lights or stuck in traffic. Miss Flower, a carer from Trowbridge, Wiltshire, claimed she was not using the iPad but passing it to a passenger in the car . A Wiltshire Police spokesman said: ‘The use of any device which distracts a driver is illegal. ‘It can cause an accident and even loss of life. We will take action against any driver caught using any device.’ Yesterday Neil Greig, director of policy and research at the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said: ‘It is clearly so stupidly dangerous to use a tablet while driving and is the sort of thing that, for us, would merit a serious charge for those stopped by the police. A simulator study we carried out for research into the effect of using smartphones on drivers found their reactions were worse than those who had the legal limit of alcohol in them or had taken cannabis. ‘People think they can control a vehicle and interact with these devices, but in fact they are more distracted by them than they are by the things which people take more seriously, like drink and drugs.’ Other research has shown motorists are four times more likely to crash if using a mobile device while driving. Those caught using a device while driving or riding a motorcycle face an automatic fixed-penalty notice of three points on their licence and a fine of £100. They could also be taken to court where they face being banned from the road and a maximum fine of £1,000. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin is considering doubling the penalty for any driver caught using a mobile phone to six points.

"'Drink driving': Guy Pelly, pictured today outside court, denied driving his black Audi TT while over the legal limit . A close friend of Prince William has claimed a drink driving charge against him could be invalid because of malfunctions in a police breathalyser machine. Guy Pelly, 32, was pulled over in his £90,000 black Audio R8 last year, and tests found that he was significantly over the legal alcohol limit. He is currently standing trial in Westminster Magistrates' Court, which heard today that a reading showed the proportion of alcohol in Mr Pelly's . breath was 52 microgrammes in 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35. But, despite the reading, and the testimony of officers who say his breath smelled of strong liquor on the night, Mr Pelly's lawyer has argued that the reading could have been wrong. He said that signals given off by radios held by nearby police officers, as well as those produced by Pelly's own iPhone, could have interfered with the intoximeter machine used in the police station. However, he was later contradicted by experts, and told the machine had been recently serviced. Pelly had that night refused to give a breath sample at the side of the road after being pulled over near Tonteria, the Sloane Square night club he runs. He was instead arrested and taken to a police station in Belgravia instead to undergo the test. Giving evidence, PC Geoff Parker told the court he stopped Pelly at around 1am on May 28 last year. He said: I noticed a black Audi pull out of a side road and travel down Sloane Street towards Knightsbridge. 'The reason my attention was drawn to the vehicle was because in my opinion it seemed to accelerate at speed. 'I decided to turn around and stop the vehicle and speak to the driver.' 'As I was speaking to him I could smell intoxicating liquor on the male's breath. 'I made a request for Mr Pelly to take part in a roadside breath test. I showed Mr Pelly the device, Mr Pelly said ""I don't want to"". 'I said to My Pelly ""If you fail to provide a sample you'll be arrested, are you refusing to provide a sample?"" Supercar: Pelly was pulled over while driving is Audi R8 supercar. He is pictured above with the vehicle in 2013 . 'Mr Pelly replied: ""Yes"".' 'I asked: ""Have you had an alcoholic drink in the last 20 minutes?"" 'He replied no. 'I asked: ""Have you had a cigarette in the last five minutes?"" 'He replied no'. 'When I asked him to take the roadside breath test he replied: ""I don't want to"". Pelly was taken to Belgravia Police Station where he gave a sample over the legal drink drive limit, around an hour after his arrest. He insists he only drank two bottles of beer that night. Phillip Lucas, defending, said that Pelly could be innocent despite the reading, as the breathalyser machine could have suffered errors in the recording that went unseen by officers. He told the court: 'I'm going to suggest to you that there are certain error messages that can be produced on this device that only come up on the screen. Famous friends: Pelly poses at an upmarket book launch at London's Saatchi Gallery last April . Friends: Prince William, left and Pelly, right, watch a Six Nations rugby match together in 2002 . 'They will not come up on a print out. Is that news to you?' Jon Fairhurst, the custody sergeant who oversaw the two intoximeter tests, said 'yes', adding: 'I would only be guided by the print out. As the print out said no errors, I took that to mean no errors.' Sgt Fairhurst said he only knew of four error messages that suggested the breathalyser machine may have given a faulty reading. But Mr Lucas said there were 13 - some of which only show up on the machine's screen and are not contained in a printout. The officer said he knew 'how to log into it, work it and be guided by it' but he said he was 'no expert' on the number of error messages that exist. Mr Lucas also suggested that police radios and mobile phones were in use near the machine and may have interfered with the reading. He told the arresting officer PC Geoff Parker: 'I'm going to suggest that your police radio was on your person and switched on.' Royal favourite: Pelly is pictured here with Princess Eugenie inside Tonteria . But the officer insisted it wasn't, and told the court: 'My radio and phone are normally taken off me and placed on the custody desk before I approach the procedure. 'I removed them myself. I placed them on the desk myself.' He admitted that there were other police officers in the adjacent custody room who would have had their radios on, but said he wasn't sure what frequency they were tuned into. Mr Lucas also claimed that Pelly still had his iPhone in his pocket when the test was carried out. He said: 'His telephone wasn't taken from him. When he came back to the desk he had to surrender his telephone. 'I'm suggesting that the defendant had his mobile phone on him during the procedure.' But the officer insisted the . socialite had been searched, his pockets emptied and his mobile phone . removed when he first got to Belgravia police station and before he was . breathalysed. The coutr . also heard how the machine was serviced and found to be in working order . on March 4 2013 - just two and a half months before Pelly used it. But Phillip Lucas, defending, said he was 'challenging the reliability' of the device. Party pal: Prince William and Guy Pelly pictured leaving Boujis, in South Kensington, after a night out . He said he had no actual evidence to prove that the machine was working perfectly. He said: 'The furthest I can go is to accept that the engineer went to check the calibration and the device. But I have no actual documentation saying it was fully operational. I don't have any actual figures about how the machine was seen on that date.' Pressed by District Judge John Zani on what the thrust of the defence case is, he added: 'I'm challenging the reliability of the breath analysis on this occasion. That has always been our challenge.' Charlotte Dale, an independent forensic alcohol consultant called by the prosecution, said there was no reason to doubt the machine's findings - especially as a repeat reading had been taken. Club owner: Guy Pelly with Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy at the launch of Tonteria . Branding the idea that it had misread Pelly's alcohol levels twice as 'too incredible'. She said: 'For it to affect two independent specimens to the exact same extent is to be too incredible. 'They are completely independent because they are two separate breath specimens. 'These are two separate breath specimens being analysed by the same hardware and coming up with the same result.' CCTV . footage played to the court shows Pelly being taken the station where . he blew into an intoxicator machine, which measured the amount of . alcohol in his system. He sat . on a bench with his arms crossed after taking the test before being told . to removed the laces from his shoes as he was put into a cell. The . 32-year-old denies the allegation.

"With parking space at a premium in London here's one off-road challenge that proved too much for the driver of a brand new £80,000 Range Rover. The luxury 4x4 – with fewer than 500 miles on the clock – was written off when it left the road and became wedged on its side between a wall and a basement. Incredibly, witnesses said the woman driver and three female passengers escaped unscathed from the crash in Fitzrovia, north of Oxford Street in central London. Crash: A brand new Range Rover Sport worth £80,000 came off the road in central London at 5am on Sunday . The gleaming white Range Rover Sport left the road and smashed through metal railings the junction of Fitzroy Street and Fitzroy Square before becoming stuck at the bottom of a 14-feet drop. The car, which costs more than £80,000 before any optional extras, was salvaged a few hours after the crash at 5am on Sunday. But the roof was wrecked and the car appeared to be destined for the scrap yard. Passer-by Farook Rahman said: ""I noticed the railing was smashed and there were some skid marks on the pavement, so I went over for a look. Bang: Remarkably none of the four women in the car which plunged 14 feet were injured . Wallop: The female driver lost control of the expensive car and ended up in a basement in central London . ""I couldn't believe it when I saw this posh car stuck at the bottom. ""That would either take a lot of skill or bad luck to land a huge car down there. ""I spoke to one of the neighbours who said the car had four girls in it and they were all right, which in itself is a miracle. ""I've never seen anything like that before.."" The vehicle is fitted with a five-litre supercharged V8 engine which develops a whopping 510bhp. Near miss: The white vehicle had just 500 miles on the clock when it ended up underground . This gives the sporty off-roader a 0-62mph time of just five seconds and a top speed which is electronically limited to 155mph.

He got out of his car and waited near the central reservation when he was awoken by a concerned driver who stopped and called the police. Kumud Singh, prosecuting, told Sevenoaks Magistrates' Court: 'A member of the public contacted police saying a Mondeo was being driven on the approach to the Clacket Lane Services at 20mph on the outside lane and holding up traffic and weaving between lanes two and three. 'They thought the driver was ill or drunk.' Sentencing: Dance admitted drink driving. He will be sentenced next month at Sevenoaks Magistrate's Court . Police said in a report that Mr Dance was ‘unsteady on his feet’, and a breathalyser found him to be nearly four times over the drink drive limit with 139mcg of alcohol in 100ml breath. The legal limit is 35mcgs. Mr Dance pleaded guilty to drink driving, with his defence lawyer telling the court he had ‘struggled with alcohol’ for years, but had no previous convictions. The case has been adjourned so a psychiatric assessment could be made. He was given an interim ban on driving until December 20 when he will be sentenced.","James Dance, 59, from south London, was four times over the limit at 9am .

"From fizzy drinks to chocolate we all have our vices, but 19-year-old Allison has taken hers to another level - with cravings for rubber shavings. For the past six years Allison from Atlanta, Georgia, has chowed down on rubber car tires as her favourite daily snack. Allison explained it was the chewiness she finds so appealing: 'The texture of the rubber pieces is like beef jerky. It’s a work out for your jaw' Strange addiction: Allison, 19, from Atlanta, Georgia has been chowing down on tire shavings for the past six years . Her first love: Allison started chewing rubber as a child when she used to munch the feet of her dolls . Shaving craving: Allison admits that she often gets stomach issues but she cannot kick her habit . She keeps little shavings bowls around her house for snacking whenever she gets the urge. Although she is not worried about the chemicals in the rubber, she does make sure the tires have been washed. When she was a child she used to chew on the feet of her dolls, but when she tired of that she moved onto chewing gum. One day she tried tire shavings instead, attracted by their potential chewiness, and has never looked back. Now she consumes two feet of shavings a day, a total of 50 full tires since her addiction began. Allison said: 'It does taste chemically but it's amazing.' Like popcorn: Allison keeps the shavings in little bowls around the house so she can snack on them all day . Grub's up: Allison says that the tire shavings are a 'great workout' for her jaw . Back up snack: If Allison cannot find any tires to hand, she makes do with the rubber bands as a lighter option . If she cannot get her hands on tire shavings, . Allison eats rubber bands or rubber glue as a substitute. As much as she loves her rubber, she does admit that it gives her regular digestion trouble. Her fiance Sammy, who works in a tire factory, was so concerned about her addiction he pleaded with her to see a doctor. When Allison eventually underwent several . x-rays to make sure there was no permanent damage to her stomach, which were all clear. However, the doctor told . her that there is still a chance she could get cancer from all the chemicals she is ingesting every day. Since then Allison has cut down, but is . still struggling to quit her addiction completely. Harmful chemicals: Allison says she is not worried about the chemicals that she is ingesting in the rubber, but she does take the precaution of washing the tires before eating them . Worried fiance: Sammy, who works in a tire factory, sent her to see a doctor . Medical help: Allison, 19, from Atlanta, Georgia, seeing Dr Melvin Glover to check there is no permanent damage to her stomach . Checking for damage: Having eaten a total of 50 tires since her addiction began, Allison had to have an x-ray to check that her body could cope with her rubber habit . Allison features on an episode of TLC's My Strange Addiction, in which another women reveal their bizarre eating obsessions - including everything from tape to cat hair to vapor rub. Danielle, 33, from San Antonio, Texas told the programme about her vapor rub addiction. She uses inhalers, patches, candles and rubs to get her fix, and even adds the gel to her morning tea. 'I like to feel it melt in the back of my throat,' she explained.","Allison, 19, from Atlanta gorges on two feet of rubber a day .

"A tatty Mini, which spent 20 years languishing in a garage and doesn't even start, has set a new world record after it sold for £31,000. The dinky Austin Mini Cooper S's engine doesn't work, there are paint defects on the car's bodywork and it doesn't have an MOT or tax. But despite its shabby appearance the iconic British motor was snapped up by a keen collector for almost four times its pre-sale estimate of £8,000. Collector's car: This tatty Mini, which spent 20 years languishing in a garage and doesn't even start has set a new world record after it sold for almost four times its pre-sale estimate . Experts are thanking the entirely 'original features' of the almond green and white car for helping achieve the huge price - and say the result makes it the most expensive Mini Cooper S ever to sell at auction. Matt Whitney, head of classic cars at . Dorset-based auctioneers Charterhouse, said: 'The sheer originality of . this car is what makes it so unique and valuable. 'Minis like this simply don't come on to the market much any more - they are incredibly rare. I would think there are fewer than a dozen of these cars existing in the world today.' Shabby chic: despite its shabby appearance the iconic 1966 British motor broke the record when it went under the hammer for £31,000 in Dorset . Boys' toy: All the car's features are original from the 1275cc engine with twin carburettors to its two-tone interior trim and body panels. It has the ultimate spec for a Mini . The Mini was made in 1966, seven years after the model was launched by the British Motor Corporation. It had just three registered owners and 75,000 miles on the clock. Its last owner, a doctor from Leicester, bought the car in 1968 and drove it until 1993 when he covered it up and left it in his garage after replacing it with a Peugeot 205. Although it needs £2,000 spending on it . just to make it roadworthy, the Mini could be worth even more than its . enormous selling price once the work is complete. Car collectors showed great interest in the battered old Austin Cooper S - bidding went through the roof and set a world record . The . Cooper model, a collaboration with Formula One and rally car . manufacturer John Cooper Cars, debuted in 1961 as a performance version . of the popular car. Richard Bromell of Dorset auctioneers Charterhouse, who sold the Mini Cooper for a record-breaking £31,000 . The Mini Cooper S was an even more powerful model released in 1963 featuring a souped up 1275cc engine. As well as being sold to the public, it was popular on the race track and won the famous Monte Carlo Rally in 1964, 1965 and 1967. Mr Whitney adds: 'All of its features are original from the 1275cc engine with twin carburettors to its two-tone interior trim and body panels. It has the ultimate spec for a Mini. 'The last owner bought it in 1968 and stored it in a garage for 20 years. 'That said, it needs a complete recommission because currently the engine doesn't work, it needs new brakes and the bodywork needs attention. 'It would cost about £2,000 to get it back on the road, and the market for an iconic car like this is only going one way - and that's up. 'There was a fierce bidding war between collectors who were set on getting their hands on this car. We knew it was a special car but it wildly outsold our estimated price.' Auctioneer Richard Bromell added: 'This was not a mint condition car by any means - it has been used well. 'Lots of people were shocked when bidding went past the £16,000 mark. The final price is a world record for a Mini Cooper S sold at auction.'","It needs new brakes, it has paint defects and no MOT or tax .

"Under plans drawn up by Labour smoking would be banned in cars carrying children. The Department of Health has always preferred to use education campaigns to stop parents from smoking in private places. But Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, believes the ban must be introduced to 'protect children from preventable harm'. Under plans drawn up by Labour smoking would be banned in cars carrying children . Labour has tabled an amendment to the Children's and Families Bill that would make it an offence for a driver to fail to stop smoking in any vehicle when a child is on board, even if the windows are open. The move is due to be put to a vote in the House of Lords on Wednesday. Research has shown that the toxic fumes passengers breathe in are up to 11 times more concentrated than those in a pub full of smoke. Labour introduced the smoking ban in pubs in 2007. The Department of Health has always preferred to use education campaigns to stop parents from smoking in private places . According to The Sunday Times, Burnham said: 'Adults are free to make their own choices but that often does not apply to children and that's why society has an obligation to protect them from preventable harm. 'There is legislation banning the use of mobile phones when driving and requiring the wearing of seatbelts.' Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, believes the ban must be introduced to 'protect children from preventable harm' A YouGov poll in 2011 found that 78% of adults agreed that smoking should be banned in cars carrying children under 18, while 44% said smoking should be banned in all cars. It is already against the law to smoke in vehicles used for work, such as pool cars or lorries. If adults are caught buying cigarettes for children they could face a £50 fixed penalty notice or a fine of up to £2,500. According to a Department of Health survey in 2012, more than one in five smokers lit up in front of their children in the home or in the car. It is against the law to smoke in vehicles solely used for work, such as pool cars or lorries. Labour has tabled an amendment to the Children's and Families Bill that would make it an offence for a driver to fail to prevent smoking in any vehicle when a child is on board, even if the windows are open. If its attempt to change the law fails it will pledge to impose a ban if it wins next year's general election.","Shadow health secretary believes the ban must be introduced to 'protect children from preventable harm'

"It could be the punchline to an old joke, and yet this picture taken on a dual carriageway shows that it takes seven council road workers just to change one light bulb. The photograph shows six men in high-visibility jackets standing around with their arms crossed as one colleague scales a ladder to check a traffic light. The photo was taken at the junction of the A30 and the M5 in Somerset, near the new town of Cranbrook, Devon and featured men working for a firm carrying out contract work for Devon County Council.

"Caught 'em: Reverend Bev Mason, the vicar at Bingley All Saints Parish Church, photographer the parking violation . A vicar who claimed over-zealous traffic wardens were preying on her Sunday congregation was shocked to see the wardens’ van parked on double yellow lines. Reverend Bev Mason took a picture of  the council van’s parking violation as attendants patrolled outside her church on Sunday, just weeks after they had given her a ticket for the same offence. The incident has been reported to the council, who have reprimanded the offending wardens, and reiterated to others that they must practise what they preach. The vicar said: ‘They must be dreadfully embarrassed. 'They were going round giving more of our churchgoers’ tickets at the time. I couldn’t believe my eyes. 'The warden’s van was parked right on the bend, on double yellow lines. ‘I called out to the two men, ‘Is this your van?’ They were mortified.’ Reverend Mason, who has had four parking tickets since starting at All Saints Parish Church in Bingley, West Yorkshire, described the wardens as ‘merciless’ in targeting her congregation. ‘These people are committed members of our community, they’re so kind and live holy lives yet they feel they’re being penalised for it. ‘Every Sunday there’s someone in our church who gets a ticket.’ She added: ‘The council have restricted the parking in the marked bays to two hours, meaning people who turn up early and stay behind after to tidy up get fined. ‘They sometimes over-run on the parking by minutes and end up with tickets - which, as good Christians, they always pay. ‘For some people, this is the only time of fellowship and they are being penalised. It’s very unfair.’ Those who stay to help with baptisms after the normal Sunday service are also among those to be slapped with fines. No excuse: The picture taken by Reverend Mason shows the council parking wardens van parked on double yellow lines outside Bingley All Saints Parish Church . Ticket targets: Reverend Mason described the wardens as 'merciless' in targeting members of her congregation who parked their cars outside the church . No parking rule: Bradford Council have now reprimanded the traffic wardens over incident outside All Saints Parish Church, Bingley, West Yorkshire . Adding the restrictions were ‘curtailing the activities of the church’, she said: ‘What my people don’t do is park on double yellows on the bend.’ All Saints was hosting a light-hearted ‘Holy Hilarity’ service that morning and Rev’d Mason added: ‘People saw the funny side and were rolling around laughing.’ Shipley MP Philip Davies said: ‘I was very sorry to learn of the concern that traffic wardens in Bingley are targeting people going to church. ‘If that is the case it would be unacceptable. ‘I will pursue this matter on behalf of the Church with Bradford Council.’ A Bradford Council spokesman said: ‘It is clearly unacceptable for a Council  van to be parked on double yellow lines and all Council Wardens have been instructed they must adhere to parking restrictions at all times. ‘We need to look into this matter to see what has happened on this occasion and consider what action needs to be taken. ‘With regard to the other point raised about extending the limited waiting time in this particular street, it is likely that any changes could raise objections from local residents living there. ‘We will contact the Reverend Mason directly to discuss both matters in more detail.’","Reverend Bev Mason says parking wardens have 'targetet' her congregation .

"Scarred: Annabelle Cooper, 26, suffered a six-inch cut to her forehead in the crash in Fawley, Hampshire . A bride-to-be was forced to abandon her wedding plans after a drink-driver crashed into her car and left her with a six-inch scar on her forehead. Annabelle Cooper 26, said her confidence has been shattered following the crash which left her 'looking like a Chucky doll'. The mother, from Fawley, Hampshire, has called off her wedding to childhood sweetheart Michael Clarke, 26, because of the facial wound. She has suffered depression following the head-on accident with Jennifer Kemish's vehicle but is now trying to rebuild her confidence so she can walk down the aisle. The wedding was booked for April 6 to mark 10 years after she got together with her boyfriend Michael at school. However, her plans were shattered following the crash on February 15 this year. She had been due to get married at Southampton Registry Office with the reception at the nearby Royal British Legion. Kemish, 30, had drunk three pints of lager at a pub in Fawley before getting behind the wheel of her Ford Mondeo, a court heard. She lost control of her vehicle and drove on to a grass verge before swerving into the path of a Vauxhall Vectra driven by Mr Clarke. He was driving Miss Cooper and their three-year-old son Paul home from McDonald's along the A326, near Hardley, at the time of the crash. Damage: The wrecked car following the accident in Fawley, Hampshire, earlier this year . Scar: The wound has now healed but Miss Cooper has been left with a scar on her forehead . Miss Cooper had adjusted her seatbelt . to turn round to tend to Paul, when the impact threw her forward, . smashing her head on the windscreen. It knocked her unconscious, left Mr Clarke with whiplash and Paul with severe bruising. Prosecutor . Kelly Wickens told Southampton Magistrates' Court Kemish had 107mg of . alcohol per 100ml of blood, which is just over the legal limit of 80mg. She was banned from driving for 20 months, given eight penalty points and fined £600 after pleading guilty to driving without due care and attention while under the influence. Kemish, from Marchwood, Hampshire, was also given a community order, and told to pay £60 into a fund for victims of crime. Miss Cooper, from Fawley, said the pain and trauma of the accident will haunt her for the rest of her life. She blinked back tears as she said: 'I'm still so shocked that someone can get into a car and cause this amount of pain to someone. 'The judge thought the sentence was good enough for her and who am I to argue with that. But my wedding plans are shattered and I have got to live with it for the rest of my life.' Miss Cooper, who has no recollection of the impact but remembers waking up in hospital, said: 'I was really scared. Family: Annabelle, 26, with her partner of ten years Michael Clarke and their three-year-old son Paul . Devastated: Annabelle Cooper, 26 has had her confidence shattered following the accident . 'I didn't know what was going on and I . couldn't see anything out of my right eye. It was really shocking to . see my reflection in the bathroom mirror, I looked like a Chucky doll . and I just cried and cried. 'As . a girl I care a lot about my appearance. It's so upsetting and unfair . that we can't fulfill that special date, but after the crash it was the . last thing on our mind. 'It's been so much for us to go through so we are putting it off for at least a year or two. 'The scar has really hit my confidence, I don't go out and socialise as much - it feels like everybody's looking at me I need to build my confidence up. 'But we will love each other and will get married eventually no matter what.' Miss Cooper also suffers agonising headaches and abdominal pains and was forced to have her appendix removed. Paul is so traumatised he struggles to sleep at night. She added: 'I can never forgive her because my son was in the car and we were innocent people. There's no excuse to get in a car drunk, especially when you could get a taxi home. If it was me I would never get in a car again.' John Paul Jones, defending, said Kemish's partner suffered broken ribs in the accident and had to take three-and-a-half weeks off work to recover. Kemish admitted one charge of driving without due care and attention while under the influence, on February 15 this year. As she left court, she said: 'I am sorry for hurting them. I didn't mean for it to happen.' Magistrate Sue Williams described the crash as 'dreadful' and 'most upsetting'.","Annabelle Cooper, 26, has lost her confidence after the crash .

"Finding yourself stuck in traffic and needing a toilet break can be an unpleasant experience. But what if you could spend a penny while on the move?

There is also a clip so he can read the newspaper while he zooms along. The petrol-powered lavatory can almost reach the national speed limit and does 10 miles to the gallon. 'It is quite scary to drive as the water in the toilet makes it very top heavy and I get wet when I go over any bumps,' said Mr Furze, from Stamford, Lincolnshire.

'The toilet seat is also quite slippery so it's hard to stay on and stop myself from sliding off when I go fast. It's also pretty tricky to steer.' Mr Furze, who is often called out to fix and install toilets, decided to build the super loo as a bit of fun.He used a mobility scooter for the base and attached a steel frame with a wooden plinth before mounting the white toilet on top. He has fitted four electronic gears to the handlebars and built a manual override, disguised as a toilet brush in case they fail. Mr Furze has also added a towel rail to the back of the toilet, covered the base with black and white lino tiles and turned the exhaust into a toilet roll holder to make it look authentic. Don't forget to flush: The toilet has a powerful 140cc motorbike engine hidden under the seat . When nature calls: If you are someone with a poor bladder you might want to hop on Chris Furze's super loo . 'I'm a plumber and I'm used to putting toilets together so I thought I'd try the challenge of making the fastest,' said Mr Furze. 'I've seen people build them before using mopeds, but I've given mine a more powerful engine so it can go much faster.' Mr Furze has managed to get the toilet to travel at an amazing 55mph but believes it will be able to go even faster along a smooth track and may even reach 60mph. The previous fastest toilet was the Bog Standard, which could travel at 42.25mph and was presented on the set of Lo Show Dei Record in Milan, Italy in March 2011. A Canadian stunt woman Jolene Van Vugt recorded a speed of 46mph on a motorised toilet in Sydney last year, but this was not verified by Guinness. Mr Furze will be doing an official time trial at the Shakespeare County Raceway in Stratford upon Avon on Saturday and hopes to gain a place in the Guinness Book of Records.","Colin Furze, from Lincolnshire, spent a month building the breakneck bog .

"Council environmental health worker Stewart Rosoman, 51, was found guilty of causing death by careless driving while unfit through drink after killing David Waterland in a high-speed crash . A council environmental health worker drank six pints of lager before driving a sports car at 110mph and crashing into another vehicle, killing its driver. Stewart Rosoman, 51, was driving home his friend, Fred Gallow, after an evening in a pub in Milton Abbas, Dorset. Rosoman, who works for West Dorset District Council, boasted of 'hitting 110mph' before veering into the wrong lane and smashing into a Honda Jazz travelling in the opposite direction. Its driver, retired company director David Waterland, 68, was killed almost instantly. His wife, Margaret, 66, was seriously injured in the crash, as was Mr Gallow. Rosoman, whose work sees him instruct people on food hygiene, denied causing death by careless driving while unfit through drink, saying Mr Waterland was to blame after suffering a dizzy spell. The council worker was found guilty and was told to expect a prison sentence. Dorchester Crown Court heard that Rosoman and Mr Gallow spent the evening of May 15 last year drinking at the Hambro Arms pub in Milton Abbas, Dorset. Rosoman drove them home in his MG convertible sports car and boasted to Mr Gallow ‘we have just hit 110 miles an hour' as he sped along Milton Road, near the village of Milton St Andrew. Meanwhile Mr Waterland and his wife were returning home after spending the evening having dinner with friends in Wareham, Dorset. Because of Rosoman's not guilty plea, Mrs Waterland was forced to relive the moment her husband was killed. Mrs Waterland said her husband had been keeping to his side of the road with the lights on. David Waterland, 68, was killed almost instantly when Rosoman's MG convertible collided with his Honda Jazz, after the council worker had drunk six pints of lager . Rosoman boasted ‘we have just hit 110 miles an hour' to his friend Fred Gallow as he sped along Milton Road, near the village of Milton St Andrew, before the crash . Rosoman, pictured explaining how to barbecue safely, is still employed by West Dorset District Council, but this may change after his sentencing next month . She said: 'Out of nowhere lights came towards us, [David] had nowhere to go.' Patrick Mason, defending, suggested Mr Waterland might have had a dizzy spell or lost consciousness. Mrs Waterland denied this and said that her husband was in fine health at the time. Rosoman could not be breathalysed at the scene of the crash because he was injured, but a nurse who treated him in hospital said he gave off a ‘fairly overpowering’ smell of alcohol and that he told her he had drunk four pints, although the prosecution said it was six. Mr Gallow said that he regretted not trying to get Rosoman to slow down during the ill-fated journey. He is still employed by West Dorset District Council. Chief Executive Matt Prosser said: 'The council would like to pass on its sincere condolences to the family and friends of the gentleman who died in this tragic collision. 'Once sentencing has taken place the council will conclude its investigation into the matter of Mr Rosoman’s position.' Rosoman, a married father-of-two, was bailed until his sentencing on November 4.","Stewart Rosoman drunk six pints of lager before driving his friend home .

Leadbeater was pulled over by officers in a stolen Mini Cooper with false number plates in Southend, Essex last July . The court heard how officers pulled over 23-year-old Leadbeater in a stolen Mini Cooper with false number plates in Southend, Essex last July. When they searched his mobile phone they found a number of photos of him sitting in the stolen cars. Holmes was arrested after police found photos of him in a stolen Mini Cooper on his mobile phone. The court heard how both men had been disqualified from driving and that the majority of the cars stolen had now been recovered. The court was also shown a photo of the pair posing together in a stolen motor, with Leadbeater wearing a pair of sunglasses and Holmes in a hoodie. The pair initially denied all the offences, but faced with the overwhelming evidence against them - much of which they provided themselves through mobile phone potographs - they pleaded guilty to the burglaries last Friday. The pair stole luxury cars including Mini Coopers, Audis, Mercedes and BMWs. The court heard how both men had been disqualified from driving . The pair each pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit 43 burglaries and attempted burglaries and will be sentenced later this week. Investigating officer Detective Constable Adrian Grew said: 'Both Holmes and Leadbeater have shown no remorse for their crimes despite overwhelming evidence being found by police during this investigation. 'They may have seen themselves as successful criminals but they left an incredible trail of evidence and slipped up in every way possible - not only were they incompetent, but they have no morals either.'","Sam Holmes, 22, and David Leadbeater, 23, from Eltham, South London pleaded guilty to burglaries .

"Drivers who think their cunning short-cuts save time in the rush hour are kidding themselves, experts have revealed. In fact, using a so-called rat run to bypass gridlock on bigger roads is more likely to make a commute longer. Congestion at the busiest times on smaller roads is twice as bad as on main highways, according to research by satnav experts TomTom. Using a so-called rat run to bypass gridlock on bigger roads is more likely to make a commute longer, according to research by satnav experts TomTom . Its annual congestion report revealed that traffic jams in British cities have become worse, with average journeys in 2013 taking 27 per cent longer than they would in free-flowing traffic – up from 26 per cent in 2012. TomTom says British commuters spend the equivalent of ten working days a year stuck in traffic, up from nine a year ago. But those clever little escape routes on which millions of drivers pride themselves to escape the worst of the jams are most likely a false economy, say the experts. And the reluctance of motorists to believe that may be down to drivers preferring to ‘feel’ as if they are on the move and in control  – even if it takes longer in reality – to the helpless feeling of moving at snail’s pace in slow moving traffic. The TomTom research notes: ‘Drivers using rat runs may actually be making their journeys slower.  The data shows that local roads have twice as much lost travel time (32%) as main roads (15%).’ TomTom spokesman Julien Speed said: ‘Many motorists are very proud to tell others about their secret rat-run that helps them avoid the worst of the rush-hour gridlock. But the reality is that it probably takes them longer.’ TomTom says British commuters spend the equivalent of ten working days a year stuck in traffic, up from nine days one year ago . He said satnav systems update traffic information every two minutes and are more accurate measure of near real-time conditions. ‘It may be counter-intuitive, but the satnavs really are more accurate. But when you are sitting in a jam it may not feel that way at the time,' he said. ‘Psychologically,  people want to keep moving, or at least feel they are moving and in control. So  they will often use their favourite rat-run to ‘get around’ the problem, even if it takes longer or the traffic moves even slower on the local roads than on the major roads which they’ve just left. On average the local roads move at half the pace.’ Mr Speed said: ‘Pride and ego is also at stake. People do like to tell others about how they have beaten the traffic, even if in reality they haven’t. Some drivers do simply think they know best and won’t be convinced otherwise. But the satnav is a better predictor.’ AA president Edmund King agreed that rat-runs often do take longer – but feel better. He said: ‘It is largely psychological. People do like to feel they are moving. You see it on clogged and congested motorways like the M25. Some drivers divert off the motorway to find an alternative route along local roads. But often they’d get to their destination quicker if they just stayed on the  congested and slow-moving main route.’ Belfast was the most congested city, with the worst periods 36per cent more congested than the free-flowing ones. London and Edinburgh were the next worst-congested cities, followed by Bristol, Brighton, Manchester, Leeds-Bradford and Sheffield. Of the 17 biggest cities, only two were less jammed in 2013 than in 2012, with congestion worsening in 10 and staying the same in the other five. The biggest increases in congestion were in Sheffield and Leicester. The company also released world-city figures, which showed Moscow was the most-congested destination, followed by Istanbul and Rio de Janeiro, which will be one of the main football World Cup venues this summer. Traffic experts estimate that time lost as a result of traffic congestion costs the UK economy £2billion a year and warn that it is set to get worse despite a £28billion plan for road improvements in the UK. The Government has forecast four million more drivers on UK roads by 2030 and that, by 2040, the volume of traffic will have risen by 40per cent.","Short-cuts do not save time in rush hour, say satnav experts TomTom .

"It must have been like watching a driving stunt from an action film – only in slow motion. An elderly motorist managed to leap between the two sides of a lifting road bridge as it rose into the air – all at 20mph. Her car carried on up the sudden incline until she  plunged 7ft off the end of the carriageway on to the other side. It then overturned, trapping the shocked woman inside. Dramatic: Fire crews try to free the pensioner from her upturned Renault Clio in Poole, Dorset . Amazingly, she suffered only minor injuries following the incident at the Twin Sails bridge in Poole, Dorset. Witnesses said the unnamed 86-year-old seemed oblivious to the flashing red lights warning that the bridge was about to rise when she crashed through a safety barrier and continued up towards the growing gap. Staff operating the bridge watched in horror on CCTV but were unable to return it to a horizontal position before her silver Renault Clio made the jump. Staff operating the Twin Sails bridge in Poole, Dorset, watched the alarming incident on CCTV but were unable to return the bridge to the horizontal position . One witness said: ‘I thought it was a boy racer trying to jump across the bridge at first. It must have given the bridge operator one hell of a shock.’ Another eyewitness, Alex Evans, tweeted from the scene: ‘Woman carried on driving as bridge was lifting. Drove off edge and landed upside down.’ A spokesman for Dorset Police  said yesterday: ‘All the flashing lights were on and the barriers had come down. ‘Witnesses said she came right through the barrier at about 15 to 20mph as the bridge was opening. ‘They immediately stopped opening the bridge but she carried on driving up the ramp and that flipped her over on to her roof.’ He added: ‘Luckily she only sustained minor injuries.’ A Dorset Fire and Rescue Service spokesman described how the elderly woman was freed from the overturned car. ‘We secured the vehicle to stabilise it, to stop the casualty moving about,’ he said. ‘There was about seven foot between the car and the edge of the bridge.’ The driver was then taken by ambulance to Poole Hospital. Poole Borough Council closed the bridge for almost four hours after the accident, which happened at 11.30am on Friday. CCTV footage showed the lifting sequence operating normally, with the warning lights and barrier system all working. The £37million bridge, which opened last year, sustained only superficial damage. It has two distinctive 180ft long ‘arms’ that resemble sails when lifted, allowing boats in and out of Poole Harbour. Her silver Renault Clio smashed into the red and white gate and carried on along the road bridge as it was being raised .

"A disabled man crashed his car into a wall while twice the drink drive limit then left the scene in his wheelchair. Neil Pearce, 32, was caught by the tracks he left behind despite contacting police to tell them that his VW Golf had been stolen by a gang of youths. His DNA was discovered on the driver's airbag and was convicted along with Sam Marshall, 19, and Andrew Watts for perverting the course of justice. Pearce had been drinking in The Brush and Easel pub in Flanderwell, Rotherham, on the night of the collision in June last year . Prosecutor Carl Fitch told Sheffield Crown Court that the trio had been drinking in The Brush and Easel pub in Flanderwell, Rotherham, on the night of the collision in June last year. At 2.19am police received reports a black VW had crashed into a garden wall in Northfield Lane, Wickersley. Between 2.21am and 2.53am police received three calls from Pearce, of The Wellway, Rotherham, who said his car had been stolen. 'The car had collided with railings before colliding with a wall in the garden of a nearby house,' said Mr Fitch.

"Popular among first-time drivers and mothers on the school run, Volvo has long been a favourite among motorists. And while the Swedish brand may have a holding with the average driver, few would consider it a thrill-seeker's choice, much less the manufacturer of Britain's fastest car. But that is exactly how daredevil Guy Martin has described his speedy run-around, after modifying a 1967 Vox Volvo estate to make what he claims to be the fastest car in the country. Scroll down for video . The 1967 Volvo Amazon was modified by Swedish supercar engineers to reach speeds of more than 200mph . The car has been hailed by owner Guy Martin as 'the fastest in Britain' and can outrun a Ferrari on racetrack . The 45-year-old car was adapted in Sweden to include a 788 horsepower engine and specialised gearbox . Bought in 2012, the car has been adapted by supercar engineers who installed a 2.8-litre turbo charged engine and six-speed gearbox. With a 788 horsepower engine, it can reach 60mph in three seconds and has thrown dust on the bonnets of some of the world's flashiest vehicles. 'I reckon it is about the fastest car in Britain - quicker than any Ferrari, Porsche or even Bugatti,' wrote Mr Martin in a recent column for the Sunday Times. 'My GSXR Suzuki superbike is about 220bhp and probably a bit quicker to 100mph, but if you put them on the road together the Volvo would leave it for dust between 100mph and 200mph.' 'The truth is, this is the quickest machine I have ever driven or ridden.' After becoming disillusioned with his Aston Martin V12, ('What? You have to put the lights on manually? That seemed a bit... ostentatious'), the 32-year-old bought the car two years ago after being shown a photograph of it at a TT race. The car, originally made in Sweden in 1967, has had its  interior transformed and a six-speed gearbox installed . After being showcased at events around the world Mr Martin bought the car which he described as 'perfect' Motorcyclist Guy Martin said he felt the Volvo gathers speed more quickly between 100 and 200mph than his Suzuki motorvike . Engine: 6.2-litre supercharged . Horsepower: 1244 bhp . 0-60mph: 2.7 seconds . Top speed: 270.49mph . Price: $1.25mlilion . Engine: 2.8-litre turbocharged . Horsepower: 788 bhp . 0-60mph: 3.1 seconds . Top speed: 205mph . Price: £70,000 (As listed by engineers in 2012) Now, Mr Martin uses it on special occasions when his other car, a Ford van, isn't suitable. 'It is perfect — the best-built, most beautifully finished car in the world,' he added. The fastest car int he world is the Hennessy Venom GT which recorded 270mph earlier this year in America. A Bugatti Veyron Supersport with a top speed of 268mph was sold in London last year, though it is not known whether or not it is still in the UK. Gary Tolson, a sales manager at Tom Hartley in London, said to his knowledge it was the fastest car in the UK. 'We sold a Bugatti Veyron Supersport here around 18 months ago, which is a production car. 'Someone can put together a kit for a car that can reach 200mph though.' The Bugatti Veyron Supersport (pictured) has a top speed of an estimated 268mph.

"A Toyota dealer in Western Australia has faced serious backlash on social media after it printed an advertisement which made a joke about a convicted sex offender. 'There's more hope of Rolf Harris getting a babysitting gig than us finding a better example', the ad read, underneath an image of a white Toyota HiLux utility. The description then went on to boast features of the vehicle such as it being a 4x4 diesel engine with a steel tray with a price of $28,990. The ad originally appeared in local paper the Kalgoorlie Miner earlier this month, but got a second wind on social media over the weekend when the image resurfaced. This advertisement ran in the Kalgoorlie Miner, a local West Australian newspaper but resurfaced on social media at the weekend causing outrage . Earlier this month 84-year-old Harris was sentenced to five years and nine months behind bars in the UK for 12 sexual assaults. According to social media users on Facebook and Twitter the reference to the Australian entertainer, who abused his daughter's best friend from the age of 13, was in extremely poor taste. One person tweeted 'This is NOT ok', while another had nothing more to say than other than a simple 'Oh dear.' According to the NT News, the offending advertisement was for Goldfields Toyota in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. The joke referenced Rolf Harris, who has just been jailed in the UK on 12 sex offence charges . General sales manager of the dealership Darryl 'Shack' Evans told the publication the advertisement was not intended to offend anyone and was removed off their website soon after publication. 'We try to make our ads a little bit interesting and a little bit lighthearted but we blurred the lines of good taste and bad on this occasion,' Mr Evans said. But the advertisement took on a life of it's own despite only being printed in one edition of the newspaper, with people calling out Toyota Australia over the inappropriate reference. Toyota Australia responded to questions on Twitter saying 'We don't endorse the ad and requested for it to be removed. Now working with dealer to ensure it doesn’t happen again.'","Ad was for a car from Goldfields Toyota in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia .

"With the rain pouring and the wind howling, the conditions perhaps weren’t the best for cycling - even on an A or B road. But one cyclist was today labelled a ‘dummy’ by traffic police after officers had to escort him off the London-bound M1 motorway near Redbourn, Hertfordshire, next to cars travelling at 70mph. Cycling on motorways in Britain is illegal - but that didn't stop the unnamed rider trying his luck on a bicycle with no lights, wearing a green hooded jacket, black trousers and a dark backpack. Not the best idea: Officers had to escort the man off the London-bound M1 near Redbourn, Hertfordshire . Police officers spoke to the man, who was on his way to London, and he will now take a train instead. A Hertfordshire Constabulary spokesman told MailOnline today: 'We were alerted just before midday today of a man travelling southbound on the M1 on a pushbike. ‘We did a very slow escort off with him at the next junction, which was junction 9 at Redbourne. We gave him words and advice, and I believe he's now getting a train. He was planning to go to London.’ Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit said on Twitter: ‘Somebody thought it was ok to cycle to London on the M1, escorted safely off at Redbourn. #dontbeadummy.’ Unimpressed: Officers spoke to the man, who was on his way to London, and he will now get a train instead . In June police spoke to another cyclist after escorting her off the M1 near Milton Keynes to an overhead bridge. Cycling on motorways is banned under section 253 of the Highway Code. Other road users prohibited to travel on motorways include riders of motorcycles under 50cc, horse riders, certain slow-moving vehicles, agricultural vehicles and powered wheelchairs. One famous example of cyclists on UK motorways came during the 2002 Commonwealth Games, when two members of the Kenyan cycling team were stopped on the M61 near Bolton. Greater Manchester Police pulled over George Ochieng, 23, and Arthur Kamu, 27, who had spent 45 minutes cycling in full kit on the hard shoulder at up to 40mph, travelling more than 17 miles. Mr Ochieng said that he and his team-mate were unaware of British laws banning them from cycling on motorways. A police spokesman confirmed the force understood it was a ‘genuine mistake’.","Police label cyclist 'a dummy' after escorting him off London-bound M1 .

"It’s not quite a highway to heaven, but it’s as high as any traveller will be able to drive when Nepal constructs the first hard-surface road leading to Lukla, the gateway to Mount Everest. The Nepalese government has announced that it is planning to build a 65 miles (100km) highway linking the village of Jiri to Lukla which will cut out four days' walk for trekkers and mountaineers. To avoid this on-foot journey, most tourists opt to fly from Kathmandu to Lukla but bad weather can cause flight chaos. A road from Jiri will cut out flight schedule problems which can sometimes seriously interfere with adventure holidays. Nepal is building the first hard-surface road leading to Lukla, the gateway to Mount Everest . The Kathmandu Post said that travel organisations had been urging the government to build the road due to the unpredictability of flight services. Known locally as Khumbu, the Everest region is the most expensive area in the country because all supplies have to be flown in. Most tourists opt to fly from Kathmandu (above) to Lukla but often poor weather disrupts flights . A gas cylinder for cooking costs Rs10,000 (£60)and a cup of tea at least Rs250 (£1.50). Flying goods by air from Kathmandu to the airport at Lukla - known as the gateway to the Everest region - costs Rs50 (90 pence) a kilogram. The paper said that apart from flight costs, the unpredictable weather means that schedules ‘can go haywire.’ Each year hundreds of tourists find themselves stranded because planes are unable to land at Lukla airport in bad weather, high winds the most common problem. It means that many tourists are forced to return to Kathmandu by helicopter, paying up to $500 (£300) each. More than 3,000 tourists were stranded at Lukla in November 2011 due to the weather that stopped flights from Kathmandu for six days. ‘Tourism will increase enormously once the new road is built,’ said Ang Tshering Sherpa, president of the Nepal Mounteneering Association. Mount Everest: Soon to be even more accessible . ‘The road will also help to bring down market prices, as goods can be trucked in for around Rs10 (06p) per kg, which is a drastic change compared to the Rs150 per kg charged by airlines.’ The Jiri-Everest base camp route follows the footsteps of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa in their historic expedition to the peak of Everest in May 1953. Eleven years later, Lukla airport was built by the Himalayan Trust created by Hillary, its objective being to ease the transport of supplies to the region. Before the airport was built, the only way to reach base camp was to walk from Jiri to Lukla, along a difficult trail at that time that took up to nine days. At least 35,000 tourists visit the Everest national park each year, most of them enjoying treks along the lower slopes of the mountain.","Nepal  building the first hard-surface road leading to Lukla, gateway to Everest .

"A dramatic assassination attempt on a man sprayed with bullets by a machine gun hidden behind the rear license plate of a parked car yesterday was foiled by the target's bulletproof Mercedes. In scenes which could have been taken straight from James Bond, the vehicle where the weapon was hidden burst into flames straight after opening fire on Radovan Krejcir, a Czech fugitive living in Johannesburg. South African police say it was a possible attempt on the life of a man who has been linked to underworld figures in his adopted home. Rodovan Krejcir stands in front of the stolen red VW Polo which had been modified with a dozen gun barrels to pepper him with bullets as he got into his car outside his gold and diamonds pawn shop in Johannesburg . But Mr Krejcir emerged unscathed from yesterday's dramatic episode, which left his own armoured vehicle peppered with impact marks and shocked observers of South Africa's criminal underworld. Nevertheless, the fugitive seemed unperturbed. 'All my life is like James Bond stuff,' he said with a chuckle in an interview with Eyewitness News, a South African media outlet. 'That's how I live my life.' The episode is the one of the most outlandish chapters yet in the long saga of the underworld in Johannesburg, where turf battles over drugs, fraud schemes and other spoils often turn deadly. Lethal modifications to the empty parked car outside Mr Krejcir's gold and diamonds pawn shop evoked Goldfinger, the James Bond film in which OO7 drives an Aston Martin with gun barrels behind the front indicators. Photographs of the stolen red VW Polo in Johannesburg show a dozen gun barrels, some of them melted or contorted by the fire that followed the shooting. About 10 bullets hit the Mr Krejcir's driver-side window, but he was out of the vehicle at that point, talking on his phone. The remote-controlled guns had been hidden . behind the rear license plate of the empty, parked car, which burst into . flames as soon as running out of bullets in the attack yesterday, possibly destroying evidence . Fiction: The method of attack evoked the movie Goldfinger, when James Bond's Aston Martin was fitted with machine guns in its lights . Mr Krejcir, who was last year sentenced to 11 years in jail in his home country for tax fraud, told local media that he initially thought he was hearing fireworks. He speculated that someone knew he always parked in the same place, positioned the gun-fitted VW for the hit and then triggered it from a distance. Security consultant Rory Steyn said on Radio 702 that there could be 'any number of motives' for the incident, ranging from an attack on Mr Krejcir to even something he set up himself to appear like an attempt on his life. Sean Newman, co-author of a book about a murdered strip club owner, said he was in the area at the time and had a close look at the rigged vehicle. He suggested the skills and planning required for such a job may have come from abroad. 'It was definitely very sophisticated,' he said. 'My first impression was that this was not local.' A Johannesburg police forensic investigator marks up the damage caused by bullets on Mr Kerjcir's bulletproof Mercedes Benz as they comb the scene. About 10 bullets hit Mr Krejcir's driver-side window . Mr Newman's book, 'Lolly Jackson: When Fantasy Becomes Reality,' traces the turbulent career the owner of a chain of South African strip clubs called Teazers who was shot dead in a Johannesburg house near the international airport in 2010. Cyprus-born George Louca was named as a suspect in Mr Jackson's killing, and the Supreme Court in Cyprus last week turned down Louca's effort to avoid extradition to South Africa. No date has been set for his extradition. Mr Krejcir, an associate of Mr Jackson and Louca, eluded a police raid on his Czech villa in 2005 and turned up in South Africa in 2007, where he has fought extradition attempts. While in South Africa, Mr Krejcir was charged with robbery and insurance fraud in unrelated cases, but the charges were dropped. In Mr Newman's book, Mr Krejcir say he is a scapegoat for killings that police have been unable to solve. According to the book, he said he was one of the first people to see Mr Jackson's body, and described the scene in detail, even suggesting how the killing may have happened. 'He's always come across as very respectful and charming in my presence. He's never threatened me,' Mr Newman said of Mr Krejcir. 'I've never seen him lose his temper. I'm sure others have.'","'All my life is like James Bond stuff,' says target Radovan Krejcir .

"Road safety campaigners have criticised two drivers after one was filmed apparently asleep at the wheel while another was pictured driving with a burger in one hand and a drink in the other. Police are trying to identify the van driver who was filmed while appearing to be asleep at the wheel in a video which was posted on Facebook. The 12-second clip shows him sitting back with his eyes closed and arms folded as the van travels at speed. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Police are trying to identify this van driver (left) who was filmed apparently asleep at the wheel . Police are also investigating this motorist for driving while holding a burger in one hand and a drink in the other . A passenger can be seen holding the steering wheel with one hand as cars drive past on the opposite carriageway. Another motorist meanwhile has also been criticised after he was pictured driving while holding a burger in one hand and a cold drink in the other. An image of the driver travelling at speed - with neither hand on the wheel - was posted on to Facebook. The footage of the apparently sleeping driver - captioned 'I don't drive but I'm pretty certain this isn't legal or safe' - was also uploaded to the site, on Monday. The prank has been condemned by road safety campaigners. Speaking about the apparently sleeping driver, Neil Greig, of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said: 'This is of course illegal and is simply asking for trouble - both on the road and from the police who will also see this video. The footage - captioned 'I don't drive but I'm pretty certain this isn't legal or safe' - was uploaded to Facebook on Monday . 'The selfishness of these people . astounds me - how could they live with themselves if they killed an . innocent passerby, just for the sake of trending on social media for a . few hours?' A spokeswoman . for road safety charity Brake said: 'Falling asleep at the wheel is no . joking matter - at least 300 people die on our roads every year as a . result of tired driving, tearing apart families and communities across . the country. 'Drivers who . fail to stop when they're tired, or mess about at the wheel and don't . pay attention, are gambling with the lives of everyone on the road.' The footage of the driver who appears to be asleep was posted by a user from Carluke, South Lanarkshire, but it is unclear when or where it was taken. A . spokeswoman for Police Scotland said: 'This type of behaviour not only . puts these individuals at risk but also other road users. 'Whether it is a prank or not what they are doing is extremely dangerous. 'I would appeal for anyone who can identify them to contact police.' A 12-second clip of the driver, which shows him sitting back with his eyes closed and arms folded, has been posted on Facebook . The . picture of the driver eating a burger meanwhile shows him in his Peugeot car, drinking . juice through a straw and holding a half-eaten McDonald's burger in his . other hand. One person who saw the picture on the site commented: 'Now that's what I call multi-tasking. HaHaHa.' But stunned campaigners branded the man's actions 'shocking'. Mr . Greig, of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said: 'There is no way . you can be in proper control of a vehicle with a burger in one hand a . drink in the other - that is just plain stupidity.' A spokeswoman for Police Scotland said: 'The photograph has been passed on to the relevant department for further inquiry. 'Inquiries are ongoing and officers are following a possible line of inquiry.'","Police trying to identify van driver filmed apparently asleep at the wheel .

"With the Scottish independence referendum just five days away, one of the country's most famous citizens has finally had his say on the vote. Groundskeeper Willie, the beloved Simpsons character, has revealed that he supports a Yes vote in Thursday's poll - and has offered to become the first leader of an independent Scotland. The groundskeeper, who is portrayed as an exaggerated version of a stereotypical Scot, said in a campaign video that he intended to 'stand in the proud tradition of William Wallace and Andy Murray'. However, unfortunately for Willie, as a resident of the US he would be unable to vote in the referendum. Scroll down for video . He's a Yes: Groundskeeper Willie from The Simpsons has come out in support of Scottish independence . The last-minute intervention was posted on YouTube by an official Fox account, and features Willie dressed in a kilt standing in front of a saltire flag. In the satirical clip, he portrays the debate as being between 'the freedom-loving heirs of the Highland tradition, and those who enjoy crawling like worms beneath British boots'. Willie adds: 'I am hesitant to throw my support to either side - be it the right one, or the obviously wrong one.' He goes on to praise the merits of an independent Scotland, pointing out in particular its whisky industry and oil reserves in the North Sea. The video then takes a surreal turn as Willie ponders Scotland's future - and suggests that he is a better choice for the country's leader than the 'safe choice' Alex Salmond. Contest: Groundskeeper Willie offered to take on Alex Salmond in the race to become Scottish leader . He says: 'For a leader who can stand in the proud tradition of William Wallace and Andy Murray, won't you consider the return of Scotland's prodigal son - Groundskeeper Willie? 'Willie won't back down to world leaders, because I haven't a clue who they are and I'm not willing to learn. 'I've lived in America most of my life, so I've seen first hand how not to run a country.' He then rips off a shirt and reveals that 'Aye or die' is written on his chest, exclaiming: 'That's not a tattoo, it's a birthmark!' The video was released ahead of the forthcoming 26th episode of The Simpsons, which is broadcast on Sky 1 in the UK. Groundskeeper Willie is just the latest in a string of expat Scots to endorse independence - actor Alan Cumming, who lives in New York, and Caribbean-based Sean Connery are both keen advocates of a Yes vote, even though as foreign residents neither of them is eligible to cast a ballot. Other fictional characters to have spoken out have opposed independence - when asked about the referendum, Shrek star Mike Myers said 'Shrek wants what the will of the Scottish people want,' adding: 'I love Scotland. I hope they remain part of Britain.' And Kermit the Frog said earlier this year that he backed David Bowie's call for Scotland to remain the Union, but that Miss Piggy was keen on independence so she can make a bid to become Queen.","Stereotypical Scot says independence debate is between 'the right side and the obviously wrong one'

"The Duchess of York faces 22 years in jail after a Turkish court pressed charges against her for secretly filming in an orphanage. The charges relate to an undercover documentary Sarah Ferguson made with ITV in 2008 to expose 'appalling' conditions in state run institutions. A spokesman for the Duchess said: ‘The Duchess of York has fully co-operated with both the Turkish and British authorities at all times on this issue. Scroll down for video . Undercover: Sarah Ferguson pictured in Turkey for the controversial ITV documentary filmed in 2008 . Caring: Sarah Ferguson talks to a child at the orphanage in Ankara, where children with mental illness suffered horrific abuse . 'British ministers refused to accede . to the further requests for legal assistance from Turkey. From a UK . perspective, the Duchess has been told by the Home Office that the case . is closed. The action today reported by the Turkish authorities is news to all.’ Yesterday a court accused Prince Andrew's former wife in absentia of 'going against the law in acquiring footage and violating privacy' of five children. She faces a maximum term of 22 and-a-half years in prison if convicted. No trial date has been set. 'Anywhere else it would be the authorities running these homes who were in the dock,' a source close to the Duchess said. 'It was a humanitarian mission, there was no political aspect to it whatsoever. The Turkish Government has no jurisdiction here and the British Government has made clear that she cannot be extradited.' Horrifying: A teenage girl is shown chained to a bench in the shocking footage captured from inside the orphanage . Distressed: Princess Eugenie wipes tears from her eyes after witnessing what was happening in the orphanage when she went round with her mother . 'Sarah is saddened that the Turkish . Government's actions are being allowed to overshadow a legitimate . journalistic investigation into the appalling conditions in state-run . orphanages in Turkey.' During . the Tonight documentary, Duchess and Daughters: Their Secret Mission, . Sarah disguised herself with a black wig and a headscarf to visit an . orphanage near Ankara. Undercover . footage appeared to show a number of disabled inmates had been tied to . their beds by staff unable to cope with them. Others were fed lying down . or confined to cots without proper care. The . day after the broadcast, however, the Turkish authorities accused the . Duchess of taking part in a politically motivated campaign against their . country and of deliberately trying to derail their bid to join the EU. Documentary team: Chris Rogers with Sarah Ferguson and daughter Beatrice in Turkey during the filming . Warm embrace: The Duchess of York was filmed giving an orphaned child a cuddle during filming of the documentary . Nimet Cubukcu, Turkey's minister responsible for child protection, said: 'It was known that this Sarah was against Turkey's EU bid.' Foreign minister Ali Babacan also criticised the use of hidden cameras, claiming it was 'a breach of privacy'. The . following year, acting at the behest of Turkish authorities, officers . from Scotland Yard presented letters to the Duchess's lawyer and to two . ITV journalists demanding they co-operate with their enquiries into the . incident. At the time a . Home Office spokesman said: 'It is not our usual policy to comment on . individual cases. However, the Home Office can confirm it has received a . formal request for mutual legal assistance concerning Sarah, Duchess of . York.' Scotland Yard . said letters had been sent to the three 'in order to organise for the . collection of information sought by the Turkish authorities'.

Britain has an extradition deal with Turkey under the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition. A suspect can be extradited if accused of an offence which is punishable in both Turkey and Britain by at least one year in prison. But it is unlikely that any attempt to extradite the Duchess would succeed - encouraging news for her as Turkish jails are known for their harsh conditions. Last night a Home Office source said: 'As it stands, she will not be extradited. The Turkish authorities have no power to do so.' A spokesman for the department confirmed: 'A judge is required to refuse an extradition request if there is no equivalent offence in British law.'","They say she 'violated' children's privacy .

"Argument: Lauren Jones, 19, died shortly after sending her friend a text saying her boyfriend had the 'major hump' with her . A teenager burned to death in her car after crashing into a tree following a row with her boyfriend, an inquest has heard. Lauren Jones died on the A42 near Horsham, West Sussex, minutes after sending a text message to a friend saying her Gareth Standing had 'got the major hump' with her after she left his house early to get her nails manicured. A text message from Mr Standing saying 'hope your nails look nice', was found on the 19-year-old's phone just yards away from the car, the inquest heard. The inquest in Crawley, West Sussex, heard how Miss Jones had been at her boyfriend's family home for his mother’s birthday celebration and had been planning a holiday with him. However, the pair then allegedly had an argument after she told him about plans to meet up with friend Kayleigh Smith-Oakley, to get her nails done. When she left the house, Miss Jones then sent a text to her friend asked her to ignore any messages Mr Standing sent her. The crash happened a short time later after Miss Jones pulled away from a set of traffic lights. Her car veered off the road and hit a tree side-on with such force that the two sides of the vehicle were almost touching. The fuel lines then ruptured and the leaking petrol caught fire. Miss Smith-Oakley told the inquest she had arranged to meet Lauren in Godalming, Surrey, at 4pm on July 24 last year. She said: 'Then I spoke to her and she said she couldn’t because there was no point coming over because he was having a go at her about leaving so early. 'I’m not sure if it was about the holiday. I think it was about her not being at his house for a long period of time.' Miss Smith-Oakley said they could go for a drink later on but whenever she tried to call Lauren after that the phone would be put down. Relationship: Gareth Standing (left), Miss Jones' boyfriend, denied the pair had a row and had sent her a text message saying 'I hope the nails look nice' minutes before the crash . When asked by Coroner Michael Kendall if the pair had argued, Mr Standing denied the accusation. Mr Kendall said: 'You say you had a . lovely day together and had no arguments. 'The evidence we will hear of . phone calls and text messages was that you had a bit of a disagreement . about the holiday that day.' Miss Jones' boyfriend replied: 'Not that I know of. We joked about how many camels . we could sell each other for, just joking around.' The coroner asked again: 'But you don’t remember having an argument about her having her nails done that day?' 'No,' said the witness. Mr . Kendall then said: 'The police log shows a text message to . Kayleigh earlier in the day, at nearly 1pm, saying: ""Gareth has got the . major hump with me"", adding that just before her crash Lauren had . texted Kayleigh to say: ""If Gaz messages, you will ignore it"".' Safe driver: Mr Standing told the inquest he had never seen his girlfriend use her phone while she was behind the wheel before the incident . The last message was sent at 4.02pm. By 4.05pm her car was burning and other drivers were . calling the emergency services. Driver Angela Wells was driving on the road at the time and told the inquest that after leaving some traffic lights she had seen a . car some distance ahead, which she later discovered to be Miss Jones, and . that they had both, in turn, been overtaken by an Audi travelling at . speed. 'I remember it going past me quite fast. I saw it pass Lauren’s car way ahead,' she said. 'I must have looked away and the next thing I’m level with her car which is in the trees, on fire.' She dialled 999 to report the incident and was told not to approach the stricken vehicle. Ronald Tofts then arrived in his Jeep and together with a trucker and other drivers they tried to get into the Ford. He . said: 'Initially I couldn’t see fire underneath the car. The fire was . on the verge but certainly by the time I had got to it, it (the fire) had tracked to the car. 'I tried to hit the window. I couldn’t . really see if there was anybody in there or not. Somebody else came . round the bank and said yes, there’s somebody in it. He . said he realised he had to try to help but he was only dressed in a . tee-shirt and shorts and by that point the fire was 'too powerful, . unbelievable'. Support: Lauren's mother Kate Bolland and friends comfort each other outside the hearing today at Crawley, West Sussex . Both Mr Standing and Miss Smith-Oakley told the inquest they had never seen Miss Jones use her phone while driving, either for text messages or phone calls. Her friend described her as a 'very sensible' driver. Pc Christopher Harrison, a forensic collision investigator for Sussex Police, said the very heavy impact with the tree had led to a v-shape indentation in the passenger side, of 80 to 90 per cent of the body’s width. The only tyre to survive the crash and fire was just over half the recommended inflation pressure but the officer said he could not rule out if this was as a result of the force of the crash. He concluded Lauren had lost control exiting a sweeping right-hand bend while travelling at about the 70mph speed limit. She had attempted to correct the steering and spun off the road. A pathologist concluded the young driver, from Hascombe, Surrey, had died of extensive burn injuries. Mr Kendall, the assistant coroner for West Sussex, said at the hearing in Crawley, West Sussex: 'We cannot be absolutely sure of the precise reason why she left the road. 'I do accept the evidence given by Mr Standing and Miss Smith-Oakley that Lauren was a sensible driver and there’s no evidence to suggest that she texted or telephoned or answered a call on her phone while she was driving at speed. 'I think the inference was the text was sent while she was waiting at the traffic lights and didn’t contribute to her leaving the road.' He recorded a verdict of accidental death.","Lauren Jones crashed into a tree on the A24 near Horsham, West Sussex .

"Killed: An Audi driver, named locally as Delano Moore (pictured), died when his car hit a double-decker bus, injuring 13 people . An Audi driver who died when his car hit a double-decker bus, injuring 13 people was 'racing' another car at 110mph, according to the bus driver. The driver, named locally as father-of-three Delano Moore, 25, died when when his blue A4 was involved in an accident with a bus in Clapton, east London, at around 2.20am today. He was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash, while his front seat passenger was fighting for his life in hospital tonight, where doctors described his condition as 'critical'. Two other men in their twenties, who were in the back of the car, were also taken to hospital after they had to be cut free from the wreckage of the car by firefighters. They are both described as 'serious but stable'. Ten people on the N38 bus were treated as 'walking wounded', Scotland Yard . said, and some were taken to hospital, including a man in his 60s who had injured his back. Police are appealing for witnesses to the crash, and are particularly keen to trace the driver of the second car involved. A colleague of the bus driver, who suffered a suspected broken leg and a cut to the head in the collision, said two cars were racing down Lea Bridge Road when one collided head on with the oncoming bus. In a text to other bus drivers, the colleague said: 'The N38 was travelling towards Walthamstow at 20mph. 'Two cars were racing at between 90mph and 110mph as the N38 was approaching an island. 'The gap was closing in as one car tried to take over another car, where the car went head on with the bus. 'One passenger in the car flew through the windscreen, the driver died and the passenger survived. 'The bus driver was left with a bleeding head, the car was demolished.' Another bus driver added: 'The driver of the N38 is fine, though he’s had a broken leg and a few stitches. 'It was in no way his fault.' Shondi Davis, the mother of Mr Moore's three daughters arrived at the crash scene with friends to pay tribute to him, laying flowers at the roadside along with bottles of Guinness in his memory. 'I got the call at 5am, I was crying, I'm still in shock. No one believes this has happened to him,' she said. 'I spoke to him yesterday on the phone. 'But he's at peace now, and we're here to pay our respects. 'He worked at Morrisons in Chingford. 'He was a loving father who'll never be forgotten. His daughters are the spitting image of him. Crash: Mr Moore died when when his blue A4 was involved in an accident with a bus in Clapton, east London, at around 2.20am today . 'He was a partier, he was always out enjoying himself, he was very loud. 'It was an accident as far as I know, I don't know if he was racing.' A message attached to flowers at the scene read: 'Larn, Babe, I got ya and the girls. Always with me Babe, love xx' Another read: 'To my darlin baby dad, I love you so much, me and your angels. Gone but never forgotten RIP xxx' The Metropolitan police have not commented on the racing claims. A . Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Police were called at around 2.20am . today to reports of a car in collision with a Route N38 bus in Lea . Bridge Road with the junction of Essex Wharf. 'London Ambulance Service and London Fire Brigade were also called to the scene. 'The . male driver was pronounced dead at the scene of the collision. Another . man who was in the car was taken to an east London hospital where his . condition is described as critical. 'Two . further men who were in the back of the car suffered injuries. They are . in a serious but stable condition at an east London hospital. The four . men are believed to be in their early to mid-twenties. 'The bus was travelling toward Whipps Cross. Casualties: Three others in the car were also injured, one critically, while 10 people on the N38 bus were treated as 'walking wounded' 'Ambulance . crews also treated about 10 walking wounded who were passengers on the . bus. A number of those were taken to hospital by another bus supplied by . Transport for London. We await further details but it is thought they . all suffered minor injuries. 'It . is believed that the car was travelling with or closely behind another . vehicle along Lea Bridge Road. The driver of this second vehicle may be a . vital witness and is urged to contact police. 'The Serious Collision Investigation Unit at Chadwell Heath is investigating. There have been no arrests.' Witnesses . said they heard a 'loud bang', that 'sounded like an explosion' before . seeing the Audi, alleged to have been speeding on the wrong side of the . road, 'practically under the bus'. The . three others in the car were also injured, one critically, while 10 . people on the N38 bus were treated as 'walking wounded', Scotland Yard . said, and some were taken to hospital. Wreck: One man in the car died, another was critically injured and the two men in the back had to be cut free by fire crews . A security guard at the former Lea Bridge Depot opposite the scene of the crash dialled 999 after he saw the crash. 'I heard a loud bang at about 1.55am and came out to investigate,' said the witness, who asked not to be named. 'I . saw a car had collided with a night bus on the opposite side of the . road. The car was practically under the bus on the driver’s side. The . driver was dead. 'It was chaos. There were people standing around injured and climbing out of the bus. 'I called the police and the paramedics and they came to the scene quickly.' According to police sources, the car may have been speeding on the wrong side of the road, with the crash coming as the bus swerved to avoid it. 'When officers arrived at the scene the bus was . very close to the verge, suggesting it may have swerved to try and avoid . the car,' said the source. Crash: The accident took place in Lea Bridge Road, at the junction with Essex Wharf in Clapton, east London. The N38 night bus was travelling towards Walthamstow Central when the accident took place . Asked if the car may have been trying to overtake another vehicle at speed, he said: 'We are not ruling out that possibility.' He added: 'This is another tragedy of someone dying on the nation’s roads. 'This was a very serious accident so it is too soon to apportion blame. 'We will be going through the evidence with a fine tooth comb before we reach any conclusions.' He added the road would be re-opened later today, once the clean-up operation was finished. Fire . crews from Homerton and Bethnal Green were also called to the crash . site, and had to cut free the two passengers from the back of the car. Roads . from Chatsworth Road with the junction of Lea Bridge Road to Orient Way . with the junction with Lea Bridge Road were closed and motorists were . advised to avoid the area. Anyone with information or who witnessed the collision is asked to call police on 101. Damage: Rose Friggi, a mother-of-two who lives near the crash site said the collision 'sounded like an explosion' This morning a wrecked blue car thought to be an Audi lay across a central reservation next to traffic lights close to the Lee Valley Ice Centre. The N38, with destination of Walthamstow Central on the front, stood nearby, its left front corner crumpled and its right side angled into a grassy verge. Rose Friggi, 32, a mother-of-two from nearby Paradise Park, said she heard what sounded like an explosion during the night. 'I was up in the night because my baby was sick,' she said. 'I heard what sounded like an explosion. My husband went to work at about 3am and he said there were police cars and a helicopter at the scene.' Mike Weston, TfL’s Director of Buses, said: 'Our sympathies go out to the family and friends of the person who died after a car collided with a route N38 double deck bus at around 2.20 this morning on Lea Bridge Road at the junction of Essex Wharf, Clapton, E5. 'The emergency services attended the scene. TfL, the bus operator (Arriva) and the police will now undertake a full investigation into this incident.' The road remained closed in both directions this morning, and four bus routes were diverted as a result of the closure.","Audi driver killed in crash named locally as Delano Moore, 25 .

"Rescue efforts to retrieve the body of a Florida man sucked into a 100-ft-deep sinkhole that opened beneath his bedroom have stalled on Saturday for fear the entire home will collapse. Florida authorities described the sinkhole as 'seriously unstable' and said the massive opening will likely continue to grow. Feared dead: Jeff Bush was sucked into a 100-ft-wide sinkhole that opened under his bedroom . A terrifying scene unfolded at the home in Brandon, near Tampa, on Thursday night when Jeff Bush, 37, was swallowed into the massive opening and trapped beneath the rubble. He is presumed dead. The sinkhole swallowed part of the interior of the house and though the home's exterior appears to be intact, rescuers fear the ground is unstable. Tests have revealed a considerable amount of water accumulating beneath the structure, making efforts even more dangerous. Local engineers were expected to continue carrying out tests on Saturday to determine if rescuers could enter the home. Bill Bracken, an engineer with Hillsborough County Urban Search and Rescue team told ABC News the house 'should have collapsed by now, so it's amazing that it hasn't.' The search team expressed their frustration on Friday night as the sinkhole kept increasing in size, starting at 15 ft deep and growing to 100 ft deep, making it too perilous to continue. Speaking to ABC News, Hillsborough County Officials said it was too unstable to use the equipment needed to try and reach the man. 'Until we know where it's safe to bring the equipment, we really are just handicapped and paralyzed and can't really do a whole lot more than sit and wait,' Hillsborough County Fire Chief Ron Rogers said. 'It's a tough situation; it's even tougher for the family.' Crews have cautiously been using ground penetrating sonar equipment at the site to map the subsurface throughout the day.

Hillsborough County Fire Rescue . officials arrived at the home at 11 p.m. on Thursday and the first . officer on the scene rescued Jeremy Bush from the edge of the chasm. Lt. Donald Morris from Hillbosourgh County Sheriff's Department described the scene officers found. 'The mattress, the bed, everything . was actually going down in the hole where the first person had gone and . now the second person is in the hole trying to save the first,' he said. 'And they're not being successful so . [the rescuer is] just reacting and doing what they have to do to get . that person out. It was deep enough that the person he pulled out to . safety was not ale to fully extend their arms and even reach the top.' Hunt: Officials use ground penetrating sonar to map the subsurface around the home to determine the extent of the danger. Crews will take this information and create a plan of action to recover Bush . Recovery effort: Crews deploy a cable controlled robot into a storm drain to look for additional damage . Search: A technician views a live video feed from a robot sent into a storm drain underneath the property . Listening devices and cameras were placed in the hole but there had been no contact with the missing man by early Friday. 'We put engineering equipment into the sinkhole and didn't see anything compatible with life,' Fire rescue spokeswoman Jessica Damico said. She . said that the sinkhole was 30 feet across at the surface, but that . engineers have estimated that below the surface it could be as wide as . 100 feet and 50 feet deep. 'The entire house is on the sinkhole,' Damico said. Rescue attempt: His brother heard his screams for help and rushed to his room where he saw the huge hole . Mourning: Family members are seen comforting each other outside the Tampa area home on Friday morning . Engineers . said they may have to demolish the small, sky-blue house, even though . from the outside, there appeared to be nothing wrong with the . four-bedroom, concrete-wall structure, built in 1974. The sinkhole is not visible . above ground except from inside the house, and officials believe its . center is beneath the bedroom. From the outside, there are no cracks . visible. The Bush home in Brandon is located in Hillsborough County which has been dubbed 'Sinkhole Alley.' Florida's environmental agency estimates that more than 500 sinkholes have been reported in the area since 1954. Condemned: The home and other properties nearby have been evacuated in fear the hole could grow . Probe: Engineers work in front of a home as they try to determine the size of the sinkhole . Search: They believe the sinkhole could be 100ft wide and 50ft deep, but their investigations continue . Search: Officials arrived on the scene at 11.30 p.m. but have so far found no sign that the man is alive . Five adults and a two-year-old child were in the house at the time of the collapse, but no one else was injured. Janell Wheeler told the Tampa Bay Times she was inside the house when the sinkhole opened. 'It sounded like a car hit my house,' she said, adding that there were screams as one of her nephews rushed . to rescue his brother from the debris. The rest of the family went to a hotel but she stayed behind with her dog and slept in her car. 'I just want my nephew,' she said through tears. Officials evacuated neighbors living . on either side of the home, which they say could be swallowed into the . ground at any moment. The Bush home has been condemned so the family will not be able to retrieve their belongings. To  help the family, the Hillsborough County Fire Rescue has established a fund and is asking for donations. 'It's the only one we've seen that . opened up in this manner there is no evidence of the structure cracking . or anything like that on the outside of the house,' Dexter Barge with . Hillsborough County's Code Enforcement told WFLA. Anthony . Randazzo, an expert in sinkholes, said he knows of only two people, who . both lived in Florida, who have died because of a sinkhole in 40 years . of his studies. 'Usually, . you have some time,' Randazzo told USA Today. 'These catastrophic . sinkholes give you some warning over the course of hours. This is very . unusual and very tragic.' Bizarre: An aerial view of the home shows no sign of the sinkhole which claimed the man's life . Watch out: Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania are the states most affected by sinkholes, according to the U.S. Geological Survey . A sinkhole is a hole that opens up suddenly in the ground. They mostly occur because of erosion or underground water that gathers naturally or due to man-made activities. When this water dissolves the foundation beneath the surface layer, spaces and caverns develop underground. Limestone, carbonate rock, . and salt beds are particular vulnerable to this erosion. Meanwhile, the top layer of Earth usually stays intact. When the dissolving area beneath the surface becomes too large, the surface suddenly gives way. According . to the U.S. Geological Survey, Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, . Kentucky, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania are the states most affected by . sinkholes. While they often . occur from natural causes, sinkholes can be man-made and caused by . human activity. Groundwater pumping and construction are the most likely . culprits. They can also occur when water drainage systems are changed. Source: USGS .","Jeff Bush, 37, screamed for help as he was sucked into the hole in Florida .

"An obese dad who ballooned to almost 30 stone after being made redundant has lost half his weight after turning to Morris dancing. Richard Landon, 47, binged on beer, pies and takeaways after being laid off from his job with Barclays bank after 25 years. The dad-of-two, of Oldham, Lancs, tipped the scales at a hefty 28st 2lbs before deciding that something had to change. Richard Landon, 47, weighed 30 stone after he binged on pies, beer and takeaways after losing his job . After cutting the calories and joining his local Morris dancing troupe, Richard lost 15 stone. He now weighs a healthy 13st 10lb and his waist has shrunk from 60 inches to just 34 . Richard decided to rejoin Saddleworth Morris Men club after being forced to leave when he became too big to keep up. After overhauling his calorie-laden diet and turning to the tradition folk dance he lost 15 stone, bringing his weight down to a healthy 13st 10lbs. His waist has shrunk from 60 inches to just 34. He has even managed to find himself a new job as a call centre worker for a local council. Richard said: 'I was devastated when I had to leave the Morris dancing team, and getting back on it is what spurred me on to lose the weight. 'When I was big I never knew if I was going to make it to the end of the dance, and on the way to one event I even split my trousers. 'I wasn’t giving the team my all and didn’t want to let them down so I had to quit. 'Now I’ve been back as part of the team since last November and I’ve lost even more weight as a result. It’s such a fantastic part of local tradition and I’m proud to be a part of it.' Richard was a former member of the Morris dancing group, but had to quit after struggling to keep up. On one occasion he missed the start of a performance because his trousers split and his wife had to fix them . Richard originally joined his local team of Morris dancers in 2007 when his weight was around 19 stone. During the time he was made redundant from his job and turned to food as a comfort his weight peaked. He said: 'I’d had the same job since leaving school and it hit me very hard. The weight continued to pile on until I couldn’t even weigh myself on regular scales. 'On the journey to one Morris dancing event I split my breeches and missed the start because my wife Lesley had to go and sew them back up for me. 'I was ashamed to tell them why I’d missed the opening dance, but everyone was very supportive. 'But the weight continued to go on until I was forced to quit the team. I always missed dancing though and the drive to get back into it is what forced me to do something about my weight.' Making a New Year’s resolution in January 2012 Richard decided to join his local WeightWatchers and went along with his mother for support. He said: 'The hardest part was walking through the doors for that first meeting, but I knew if I didn’t go then I would never bite the bullet. Richard says he plans to keep the weight off by cutting back on beer, saving it for special occasions . 'I saw a couple there that I knew and they were a husband and wife team so I wasn’t the only man there and more importantly, everyone was so friendly and welcoming. 'I immediately felt at ease and a sense of relief washed over me knowing that now I have had the courage to take that first step, I could just be successful with this journey.' Now Richard is back in the Saddleworth Morris Men and looking forward to the new season. He said: 'I’m going to have to watch my alcohol consumption because the last thing I want is to put the weight back on. 'The plan is to drink a lot more soft drinks and save the drinking for special occasions.","Richard Landon, binged on alcohol and junk food after losing his job .

"Nigel Farage was described as a gift to Yes campaign after upsetting voters by describing Scotland as 'huge chunk of territory' Nigel Farage’s visit to Scotland yesterday to campaign for the Union will have persuaded voters to back independence, Alex Salmond claimed last night. The First Minister said the Ukip leader joining the campaign trail in Glasgow to ask Scots to vote No was a gift to the Yes campaign. Mr Farage said that he had gone there to win back Labour supporters who had decided to vote for independence. But before he had even arrived he had upset Scots by describing Scotland as ‘a large chunk of our territory’. Mr Salmond, who was campaigning in Aberdeen, said Mr Farage was as an asset to the Yes camp. The SNP leader said there is ‘huge disillusionment with the Westminster system’ and that extended to Ukip’s ‘negative, insular, anti-European brand of politics’. He added: ‘A lot of people in Scotland have no time for that and therefore Mr Farage is a rival to Scotland and will be an asset to the Yes campaign, and a huge embarrassment of course to the No campaign.’ At a Ukip rally in Glasgow last night, Mr Farage said the Prime Minister had been ‘moronic’ for not putting the option of maximum devolution on the ballot paper along with Yes and No. He said: ‘I was astonished that the Prime Minister allowed for the separatists to be given the “yes” side of the referendum question. Scroll down for video . ‘Far better from his point of view, you would have thought, would have been to have asked the question “Should Scotland remain part of the United Kingdom?”. ‘But no, on this he blundered and more fundamentally he blundered by not offering the Scottish people, the “devo max” option.’ Earlier, Mr Farage had suggested the Queen has a responsibility to speak out and tell Scots to vote against independence. The First Minister described the UKIP leader's visit as a gift to his campaign, describing Farage as a 'rival' of Scotland and therefore an 'asset' to his crusade . He told radio station LBC: ‘My understanding of the constitution is if the kingdom itself, if the United Kingdom itself is under threat, then in many ways you could argue she has a responsibility to say something. ‘Let’s say we got to this Sunday and let’s say it was still 50-50 in the polls, I personally think she should say something, yes.’ He said English people were feeling ‘ignored’ in the independence debate and argued that the strengthening of the devolution settlement offered by pro-Union parties in the event of a No vote should apply to other parts of the UK, as well as Scotland. Last night 60 demonstrators gathered outside the Ukip rally and Mr Farage was smuggled in a side door to avoid them. It overshadowed an event held by Labour last night, which saw party leader Ed Miliband share a platform with former prime minister Gordon Brown for the first time since he left Downing Street in 2010. Labour peer Lord Foulkes last night said: ‘Farage’s intervention is counter-productive. ‘As always, his ego comes before the cause.’ Friday night in a Glasgow distillery...were we in for a bit of a stooshie? ROBERT HARDMAN in Scotland . Glasgow city centre of a Friday night. Not exactly quiet pint territory at the best of times. So the arrival of Nigel Farage – that personification of cocky Englishness – with a blunt message for the Scots could reasonably be expected to generate more heat than light. We were probably in for what locals like to call a bit of a stooshie. A couple of van loads of police were not taking chances. One or two mouthier onlookers were carted off. When the Ukip leader came to Edinburgh on the European campaign trail, he was famously set upon by a mob who forced him to seek refuge in a pub. Last night, he had pre-empted a repeat by booking an entire distillery in advance. Arriving in a big, blacked-out limo, he stepped straight through a back door while a few dozen general-purpose ‘activists’ gathered at the front. For his trip to Scotland, the UKIP leader had dropped his fag-and-a-pint-of-your-finest routine . The Teacher building has not actually produced any whisky since becoming a chi-chi downtown conference centre in 1991. But it still boasts peaty old names like the Laphroaig Suite and the Ardmore Room. Of anything resembling a bar, though, there was no sign. But Mr Farage had dropped the fag-and-a-pint-of-your-finest routine for this trip. When it comes to his taste in drink and tobacco, he is much closer to Clydeside Man than any other party leader, but his cheeky City trader schtick has very limited appeal north of the Border. And he knows it. So, after a rumbustious tour of the London radio studios at breakfast time, he came to Glasgow last night with an uncharacteristically sombre speech. There were few of the usual barbs at Euro bogeymen like Herman van Rompuy. He wasn’t even particularly rude about Alex Salmond. He was selling a ‘pig in a poke’ and all that. David Cameron had been as ‘arrogant as Edward II at Bannockburn’ in letting Mr Salmond dictate the terms of this referendum. But his central message was that if Scots wanted to control their own destiny, then becoming a ‘small and pretty irrelevant province’ of a German-controlled EU was not the answer. This rally of 100 activists even heard a pat on the back for the IRA (in contrast to an earlier speaker’s fiery denunciation of the SNP as IRA-supporting ‘scum of the earth’). ‘I absolutely hold no brief for Gerry Adams but at least there is a consistency to his nationalism. He doesn’t want Northern Ireland to be part of the United Kingdom, but neither does he want the island of Ireland to be governed by the bureaucrats of Brussels,’ he said sternly. ‘What Alex Salmond is offering isn’t nationalism on a Scottish level, it is supra-nationalism on an EU level.’ Eh, pal? Deep waters for a Friday night. The Bank of England would never ever underwrite a Scottish currency, Mr Farage avowed. The English would never buy it. He finished not with a warning, though, but an outstretched hand: ‘It’s your Union, too.’ Outside, there was a weird absence of either Yes or No camps. The latter had wanted nothing to do with Mr Farage. On the basis of ‘my enemy’s enemy is my friend’, the Yes movement were happy to leave him to it. With 140,000 votes in the Euro elections, Ukip now has a Scottish MEP, a roly-poly, openly gay freight boss called David Coburn. He led the warm-up with a fabulously off-message press conference. By his own admission, his head was somewhat clogged by a streaming cold. Vladimir Putin? ‘He is doing a good job for his country.’ Ukraine was all the EU’s fault. Asked about Ukip’s appeal to women voters in this referendum campaign, Mr Coburn replied: ‘Speaking as a homosexual, I suppose I could give them fashion tips – or advice on their drapery.’ For all Ukip’s bluster about ‘Farage Friday’ as a ‘pivotal moment’ in this campaign, it was not. It will probably go down as a footnote. But it was different.","Salmond says UKIP leader was an asset to Yes campaign after blunder .

"Alex Salmond was a leading member of a Republican faction that was expelled from the Scottish National Party in the 1980s. The 79 Group – named after the year in which it was formed – wanted to set up a Scottish Socialist republic and spent several years fighting for more radical policies within the SNP. The removal of the Queen as Scotland’s head of state was one of its founding principles. Scroll down for video . The First Minister was once part of a Republican faction called the 79 Group which called for the removal of the Queen as Scotland's head of state . The group even had links with Irish republican party Sinn Fein at the height of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Mr Salmond was one of its three spokesmen and took responsibility for publicity. He argued for greater militancy among workers, and advocated direct action including civil disobedience, according to his biographer, David Torrance. But the group was eventually banned and its leading members – including Mr Salmond and Kenny MacAskill, now the Scottish justice minister, were expelled. The group’s fervent Republicanism contrasts to Mr Salmond’s current support for the Queen. He has pledged to keep the monarchy if there is a Yes vote for Scottish independence. Nine years after forming the 79 Group, Salmond attended the televised Chancellor's Budget at the House of Commons (pictured) ‘I think Her Majesty the Queen, who has seen so many events in the course of her long reign, will be proud to be Queen of Scots as indeed we have been proud to have her as the monarch,’ the SNP leader said this week. But earlier this year, Mr MacAskill suggested there could be a referendum on scrapping the monarchy if Scots vote Yes. He said in March: ‘We will inherit the situation we have with the Queen as head of state in the ceremonial capacity that she has. But it will be for the people of Scotland to decide. ‘If and when that would occur, if they wished to have a referendum, and we would hope we would become the government post-2016, it will be for whoever is in office then.’ The 79 Group, which was formally known as the ‘Interim Committee of the 79 Group Socialist Society’, was formed after the 1979 referendum asking Scots whether they wanted their own Scottish Assembly with devolved powers. Despite a narrow majority in favour of devolution, no parliament was set up at that time because there was not the minimum required turnout of 40 per cent. The Scottish parliament was eventually formed after another referendum in 1997. The 79 Group had called on the SNP to target urban working-class voters as a radical alternative to Labour. At one meeting the group discussed a request from Sinn Fein for a speaker from the Irish Republican party to attend its annual conference. According to minutes of the meeting, Mr Salmond argued for rejecting the request. Members of the 79 group were expelled from the SNP in 1982 but re-joined shortly afterwards. In 1985 Mr Salmond was elected to party office and began his rise up the SNP ranks to become its leader. Mr Salmond has sought to brush off his involvement with the 79 Group, describing his involvement as the result of being a ‘brash young man’.","Salmond part of Republican faction expelled from SNP in 1980s .

"Thomas Eric Duncan lied about his exposure to Ebola to hospital staff and to public health officials, even as he was suffering from projectile vomiting and other symptoms of the horrific disease at Texas Presbyterian, an emergency room nurse has revealed. Duncan initially claimed that he had not been around anyone who had died when he was in Liberia after he was admitted to the Dallas Hospital last month, Sidia Rose told '60 Minutes' on CBS. It has since been revealed that he helped care for a pregnant woman who is believed to have died of Ebola in his native Liberia. It is believed  he contracted the illness from her. Scroll down for video . Nurse Sidia Rose says Thomas Eric Duncan lied to her about his contact with Ebola victims - even as she cleaned up his infected bodily fluids . Authorities say that Duncan lied to airport screeners in Liberia in order to be allowed to fly from the Ebola-stricken West African nation to the United States. He died on October 8 . Officials have accused Duncan of lying about his contact with Ebola in order to fly out of Liberia and into the United States. He was in Dallas for several day before he began to show symptoms of the disease. Ms Rose said that when she first saw Duncan he has projectile vomited on the walls of his isolation room at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital and was suffering from explosive diarrhea - usually the second phase of the illness. The nurse, wearing rubber gloves and a face mask, cleaned up the bodily fluids, which contained the deadly virus. Still, when she asked him whether he had been in contact with anyone how had been sick when he was in Liberia, he responded: 'No. He said no,' Ms Rose told CBS. Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital has been widely criticized for its response to the Ebola outbreak in Dallas, though nurses who treated Duncan defended the hospital's actions . Nurses had drawn his blood and sent the samples to a lab to check for Ebola - but the results would not be due back for 48 hours. She followed up and asked him whether he had been in contact with anyone who had died. 'And that's when he said to me his family had suffered a loss. That he had buried his daughter who had died in childbirth,' she said. However, when Texas public health officials later interviewed him, he died in own story about coming into contact with anyone who had died in Liberia. Nearly 4,700 people have contracted the deadly disease in Liberia and 2,700 have died - overwhelming the very poor nation's meager public health system. Doctors have still not been able to control the spread of the infection in Liberia and the other West African nations of Sierra Leone and Guinea. Ms Rose says she had been reading about Ebola and efforts to contain the disease in Africa before Duncan was admitted. When she first went in to see Duncan, she says, she was 'very frightened.' 'I didn't allow fear to paralyze me. I got myself together. I'd done what I needed to get myself prepared mentally, emotionally, and physically, and went in there and did what I was supposed to,' she told CBS. Two Texas Presbyterian nurses contracted Ebola from 42-year-old Duncan while they were caring for him before his death on October 8. Nina Pham and Amber Vinson are both cured of the disease now, though their colleagues - including Ms Rose - are still nervously waiting out the 21-day incubation period. The nurses defended the actions of the hospital, which as been widely criticized for its response to the Ebola outbreak in Dallas. They said they believed they were properly protected - to the level CDC guidelines at the time suggested - when caring for Duncan.","Sidia Rose says Duncan lied to her about caring for a pregnant woman who later died of the disease when she first questioned about it .

"This £23million private jet flew Tesco executives around the world in luxury for years but is now up for sale after the supermarket giant's profits, sales and share price all dive-bombed. The Gulfstream G550 is one of four private planes now on the market as the grocer is facing the biggest crisis in its 95-year history. The decision to put them up for sale marks the end of excesses enjoyed by Tesco's bosses while sales and profits have tumbled in recent years. New chief executive Dave Lewis has called for austerity, which means selling off the jets that used to fly up to 14 executives at a time across the globe. Scroll down for video . High life: This seven-year-old Gulfstream G550 flew up to 14 Tesco executives around the world but is now up for sale for £23million . Change of direction: Tesco has a fleet of jets but amid falling sales and profits they are being sold as its new CEO demanded austerity . Jet-lagged: Executives could also retire for some sleep on the plane, which has full-length beds, TVs and other entertainment . This seven-year-old jet, with a 580mph top speed generated by two Rolls-Royce engines, flew management from Britain's biggest retailer on business trips. They would lounge in large leather armchairs while being served food and drink by cabin staff. On longer journeys to America and Asia they would be able to head off to cabins for some sleep in full sized beds. Max range: 7697 miles - London to Johannesburg . High speed: 560mph . Passenger capacity:14 . Interior seating length: 35.35ft . Overall cabin length: 50.1ft . Cabin height: 6.2ft . Cabin width: 7.3ft . Baggage Capacity: 226 cubic ft . For entertainment, the jet has DVD players, several widescreen TVs and a bar stocked with wine and spirits. It also has more than 226 cubic feet of luggage space, ample room for 20 suitcases and several sets of golf clubs. Gulfstream, which is based in the United States, said they may be close to finding a buyer. Tesco owns two Gulfstream G550s, the one pictured and another new £30million model, which was delivered this year but now also up for sale. It also has a Hawker and a Cessner worth up to £10million. The supermarket giant revealed last week that its half-year profits slumped by 91.9 per cent and its £263million accounting scandal was even worse than predicted. The bad news sent the markets into a panic and its shares plunged, dropping below £1.70 for the first time since 2003. On Friday they were available for £1.65 but a year ago they were worth £3.70, meaning Tesco has had £4billion wiped off its stock market value in just 12 months. Millions of customers have switched to budget rivals like Aldi and Lidl or high-end Waitrose and Marks and Spencer because Tesco has failed to deliver on price, service or quality, . But CEO Dave Lewis yesterday refused to be drawn on what he would do to win back shoppers. He said: 'Everybody's been saying to me, 'Dave, when are you going to reveal your strategy – when is there going to be an announcement about what you're going to do?' And I won't be doing that because strategies are constantly evolving. However, Mr Lewis has been clear on one thing, that executives should forget the past high life they enjoyed, and he is swapping his company car for the train. The former boss of consumer goods giant Unilever said he wanted all staff to examine whether a cost was absolutely necessary and something customers would think felt right. Top executives at Tesco have been forced to shop and cook like housewives as part of a plan to put them back in touch with their customers. The bosses were sent food shopping at Tesco and at all its main rivals then whisked away to a small, remote holiday cottage in Norfolk. Excesses: Executives would on long and short haul trips in the plane, and were served food and drink from this galley by a team of staff . Bathroom: Passengers had access to a wide range of products and facilities, including a shower and full-size toilet . For his part, in what most will see as a symbolic gesture, Lewis said wherever possible he would forgo his company Mercedes Viano people carrier and take the train to London from the head office in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. In particular he is seeking to unwind some of the largess of former boss Philip Clarke, who was sacked a month before the private jets went on sale. Philip Clarke still retains the use of a company chauffeur despite having not set foot in the firm’s head office since August. The Mail understands that Ferrari-driving Clarke is still entitled to all the trappings of his previous position as chief executive despite having stepped down in August ahead of the financial scandal. This includes a driver, membership to clubs, security, health insurance and even a staff discount. He gets this on top of a £1.1m salary which continues to be paid until January. Tesco operates a pool system of cars and drivers which include Mercedes saloons and mini vans. It is also thought Tesco is paying his membership of the exclusive private dining club 5 Hertford Street, based in Shepherd’s Market, London. The perks, sanctioned by chairman Sir Richard Broadbent will anger investors who have seen Tesco shares lose 53pc of their value over the past year. It also brings into question Broadbent’s judgement given the scandal that has since engulfed the grocer.

"A ‘tipsy’ Michael Gove has launched an extraordinary wine-fuelled attack on Boris Johnson, saying he ‘has no gravitas and is unfit to lead the nation’. The Education Secretary also claimed the London Mayor’s appeal would ‘wear thin’, Home Secretary Theresa May had ‘no appeal’, and George Osborne is the only man capable of succeeding David Cameron. Mr Gove’s remarks, made during a private dinner at Rupert Murdoch’s home in Mayfair, Central  London, come amid a bitter Tory leadership row that threatens to disrupt party unity in the run-up  to May’s European polls and next year’s General Election. Tipsy: Mr Gove, pictured with Boris Johnson after a dinner at the exclusive Mayfair restaurant Scotts last year, reportedly said the London mayor did not have enough gravitas to lead the Conservatives . He made his comments as he and fellow guests enjoyed several £100 bottles of red wine from Mr Murdoch’s Californian vineyard. Friends of Mr Gove confirmed he was ‘tipsy.’ The Education Secretary’s outburst shocked fellow guests – who repeated his comments to Mr Johnson when he dined with Mr Murdoch the following evening. The revelation threatens to intensify the bitter rift involving the four main contenders to succeed Mr Cameron: Mr Johnson, Mr Osborne, Mrs May and Mr Gove. Culprit: Several £100 bottles of Moraga Cabernet Sauvignon were circulating . Mr Gove told the dinner guests:  ‘There are only two people fit to be Prime Minister: George Osborne and William Hague. William has made it clear that he doesn’t want it so that leaves only one candidate – George. Boris is incapable of focusing on serious issues and has no gravitas. He isn’t a team player and plays to the gallery the whole time. ‘The whole Boris routine will wear thin with the electorate very quickly if he became PM. And he can’t make tough decisions. ‘George is a team player who is serious and substantial. Look at all the tough stuff he has done already in Downing Street. Theresa May has little chance of gaining the support of the electorate – she can’t even gain the support of her colleagues.’ One witness said: ‘It was an extraordinary and sustained onslaught by Gove. He fired an Exocet at Boris and had a go at Theresa May for good measure. ‘Like the rest of us, Michael enjoyed Mr Murdoch’s wine and tongues became looser as the evening progressed. Everyone was gobsmacked at what he said.’ The dinner took place on December 5 – the day Nelson Mandela died. Other guests, who included senior editors at Mr Murdoch’s News UK newspapers, including The Sun, left early to change their late editions. Mr Johnson had already been invited to dine the following evening, along with several of Mr Murdoch’s executives, many of whom had been there the previous day. By the time the London Mayor arrived, he had already got wind of Mr Gove’s attack. Guests immediately challenged him to rebut the Education Secretary’s criticisms. ‘We told him Gove had said he wasn’t up to the job and a lightweight compared to Osborne,’ one said. ‘Boris relished it and gave a robust reply. He gave a long list of his tough decisions in London – and his record as an election winner.’ Tory MPs have been taken aback by the outbreak of hostilities between Mr Gove and Mr Osborne on one side, and Mr Johnson on the other. Contenders? Gove is said to favour George Osborne but Theresa May could also be in the running . The Mail on Sunday revealed on February 2 how the Chancellor and Mr Gove have joined forces in an attempt to deny the Tory leadership crown to Mr Johnson. And on March 2, we revealed how a furious Mr Johnson called Mr Osborne a ‘liar’ for claiming he had urged him to return to the Commons as an MP in next year’s Election to ‘prove his loyalty’ to Mr Cameron. An ally of the London Mayor said: ‘Boris was puzzled and hurt by Michael’s unwarranted attack. He had thought of him as an ally. It seems he has thrown his lot in with Osborne instead. He will regret it. Osborne has zero support among the public; Boris has enormous appeal.’ Mr Gove sparked further controversy yesterday by claiming  there is a ‘ridiculous’ number of Old Etonians among the Prime Minister’s inner circle. The comment was seen as another sideswipe at Old Etonian Mr Johnson, rather than Mr Cameron, a close friend of Mr Gove. The adopted son of an Aberdeen fishmonger, Mr Gove issued a fresh denial yesterday that he has leadership ambitions, saying he lacked the ‘extra spark of charisma and star quality’. Influence: The high-profile figures were dining at the private Mayfair home of Rupert Murdoch . But some Tory MPs believe his increasingly high-profile political activities and pronouncements, in private and public, indicate he is preparing his own leadership campaign. One female Conservative MP said: ‘Michael is the perfect Tory role model. He won a scholarship to a fee-paying school on merit, not thanks to Mummy and Daddy’s cheque book. He’s a proper Tory who loathes Brussels and favours low taxes. He may be an ugly duckling but so is Boris, and he is every bit as witty. People could grow to like him.’ An ally of Mr Johnson said: ‘Gove and Osborne keep laying traps for Boris to fall into but he is too smart for them. He will return to the Commons at a time of his choosing – not theirs.’ The wine that loosened Mr Gove’s tongue was from Mr Murdoch’s 16-acre Moraga Canyon estate in Bel-Air.  The 2007 and 2008 Moraga Vineyard Bel-Air Cabernet Sauvignons sell for up to £100 a bottle. A friend of Mr Gove said: ‘Michael had several glasses of wine at the Murdoch dinner and was tipsy. Whatever else he said, the truth is he likes Boris.’","Revelation comes amid a bitter Tory leadership row between four figures .

"Apple has been left red-faced again after a fresh security breach was discovered in the iPhone's software the day after it released an update fixing the last one. The new vulnerability differs from the passcode bug fixed by the latest iOS update but it too gives unauthorised access to the phone's contacts and photos. It emerged after the Silicon Valley firm released iOS 6.1.3, which put a stop to hackers who discovered a simple combination of button presses to bypass the phone's lock screen. Hacked: A new flaw in iOS has been revealed which can allow hackers access to iPhone owners' pictures and contacts, just a day after Apple released a software update to fix a previously discovered vulnerability . The new lock screen bug is slightly less complicated and involves ejecting the iPhone's SIM card while using its built-in voice controls to make a phone call. It was revealed by YouTube user videosdebarraquito, who posted a video detailing the procedure. That's the same phone enthusiast who spread the word about the earlier exploit, again via YouTube. The latest video shows the exploit executed on an iPhone 4 but it seems the bug applies to most modern iPhones, ars technica reported. The hack involves activating voice dialling mode from the lock screen and instructing the phone to make a call, then ejecting the SIM card at just the right moment. That brings up the phone's dialling pad, from where the contacts list can be accessed and, via that list, the owner's photos. Insecure: The phone's contact list can be accessed and, via that, the photo gallery . Precaution: Turning off the 'Voice Dial' feature will keep personal information safe, but if Siri is enabled for lock screen use the exploit doesn't work either . Iphoneincanada replicated the hack on the same model phone, while TheNextWeb managed it on an iPhone 4S but not an iPhone 5. iPhone 5 users should still beware, however, since German site iPhoneblog.de claims to have carried out the hack on Apple's latest smartphone offering. Siri does not appear to be the culprit allowing unauthorised access to the phone, instead the exploit is carried out through Apple's Voice Control feature which predates the virtual assistant. Videosdebarraquito recommends turning off the 'Voice Dial' feature to keep personal information safe, but if Siri is enabled for lock screen functionality the exploit doesn't work either, according to ars technica. The video detailing the hack was published just yesterday but has already attracted more than 120,000 views. Apple has yet to comment.","New vulnerability gives unauthorised access to contacts and photos .

"Well-water contamination caused by controversial oil and gas drilling - known as fracking - has been confirmed in at least three U.S. states which have nurtured the nation's energy boom, according to a new review of industry data. New figures show that hundreds of complaints have been made about pollution in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and Texas, casting doubt on industry suggestions that such problems rarely happen. In Pennsylvania alone, at least 106 cases of water-well contamination have been confirmed in the last eight years. The data, requested by the Associated Press, also highlight a lack of transparency and major differences in the way these problems are reported. Anger: Anti-fracking protesters hold placards near the White House in September last year. New figures show that water-well contamination from oil and gas drilling has been confirmed in at least three states . Controversial: A rig drills for natural gas at a hydraulic fracturing site in Pennsylvania, a state where more than 100 cases of water-well contamination have been confirmed since 2005 (file picture) While the confirmed problems . represent only a tiny portion of the thousands of oil and gas wells . drilled each year in the U.S., the lack of detail in some state reports could help fuel public confusion and mistrust. Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia provided only general outlines, while Texas, which hasn't confirmed a single case of drilling-related water-well contamination in the past 10 years, released the most detail. The AP found that Pennsylvania received 398 complaints in 2013 alleging that oil or natural gas drilling polluted or otherwise affected private water wells, compared with 499 in 2012. The Pennsylvania complaints can include allegations of short-term diminished water flow, as well as pollution from stray gas or other substances. More than 100 cases of pollution were confirmed over the past five years. Just hearing the total number of complaints shocked Heather McMicken, an eastern Pennsylvania homeowner who complained about water-well contamination that state officials eventually confirmed. 'Wow, I'm very surprised,' said McMicken, recalling that she and her husband never knew how many other people made similar complaints, since the main source of information 'was just through the grapevine.' Confusion: A fracking site in South Montrose, Pennsylvania. The new data highlights a lack of detail in some state reports which could help fuel public mistrust in the industry (file picture) The McMickens were one of three families that eventually reached a $1.6 million settlement with a drilling company. Heather McMicken said the state should be forthcoming with details. Over the past 10 years, hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has led to a boom in oil and natural gas production around the nation. It has reduced imports and led to hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue for companies and landowners, but also created pollution fears. Extracting fuel from shale formations requires pumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of water, sand and chemicals into the ground to break apart rock and free the gas. Some of that water, along with large quantities of existing underground water, returns to the surface, and it can contain high levels of salt, drilling chemicals, heavy metals and naturally occurring low-level radiation. But some conventional oil and gas wells are still drilled, so the complaints about water contamination can come from them, too. Experts say the most common type of pollution involves methane, not chemicals from the drilling process. Fracking fame: The Manning family gained celebrity status last year after blaming the high level of methane in their well water in Franklin Forks, Pennsylvania, on a natural gas driller . Some people who rely on well water near drilling operations have complained about pollution, but there's been considerable confusion over how widespread such problems are. For example, starting in 2011, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection aggressively fought efforts by the AP and other news organisations to obtain information about complaints related to drilling. The department has argued in court filings that it does not count how many contamination 'determination letters' it issues or track where they are kept in its files. Steve Forde, spokesman for the Marcellus Shale Coalition . Steve Forde, a spokesman for the Marcellus Shale Coalition, the leading industry group in Pennsylvania, said in a statement that 'transparency and making data available to the public is critical to getting this historic opportunity right and maintaining the public's trust.' When the state Environmental Department determines natural gas development has caused problems, Forde said, 'our member companies work collaboratively with the homeowner and regulators to find a speedy resolution.' Among the findings in the AP's review: . — Pennsylvania has confirmed at least 106 water-well contamination cases since 2005, out of more than 5,000 new wells. There were five confirmed cases of water-well contamination in the first nine months of 2012, 18 in all of 2011 and 29 in 2010. The Environmental Department said more complete data may be available in several months. — Ohio had 37 complaints in 2010 and no confirmed contamination of water supplies; 54 complaints in 2011 and two confirmed cases of contamination; 59 complaints in 2012 and two confirmed contaminations. It had 40 complaints for the first 11 months of 2013, with two confirmed contaminations and 14 still under investigation, Department of Natural Resources spokesman Mark Bruce said in an email. Anti-fracker: Artist and musician Sean Lennon is pictured at a gas drilling site in Franklin Forks during an 'Artists Against Fracking' bus tour of gas drilling sites in upstate New York and Pennsylvania . None of the six confirmed cases of contamination was related to fracking, Bruce said. — West Virginia has had about 122 complaints that drilling contaminated water wells over the past four years, and in four cases the evidence was strong enough that the driller agreed to take corrective action, officials said. — A Texas spreadsheet contains more than 2,000 complaints, and 62 of those allege possible well-water contamination from oil and gas activity, said Ramona Nye, a spokeswoman for the Railroad Commission of Texas, which oversees drilling. Texas regulators haven't confirmed a single case of drilling-related water-well contamination in the past 10 years, she said. Up in arms: Anti-fracking activists demonstrate in New York in September last year over claims the industry is contributing to climate change and other environmental issues affecting communities . In Pennsylvania, the number of confirmed instances of water pollution in the eastern part of the state 'dropped quite substantially' in 2013, compared with previous years, Department of Environmental Protection spokeswoman Lisa Kasianowitz wrote in an email. Two instances of drilling affecting water wells were confirmed there last year, she said, and a final decision hasn't been made in three other cases. But she couldn't say how many of the other statewide complaints have been resolved or were found to be from natural causes. Releasing comprehensive information about gas drilling problems is important because the debate is no longer about just science but trust, said Irina Feygina, a social psychologist who studies environmental policy issues. Losing public trust is 'a surefire way to harm' the reputation of any business, Feygina said. Experts and regulators agree that investigating complaints of water-well contamination is particularly difficult, in part because some regions also have natural methane gas pollution or other problems unrelated to drilling. A 2011 Penn State study found that about 40 percent of water wells tested prior to gas drilling failed at least one federal drinking water standard. Pennsylvania is one of only a few states that don't have private water-well construction standards. Outrage: Anti-fracking activists protest in New York in September last year. Fracking has led to a boom in oil and natural gas production around the nation over the past ten years . But other experts say people who are trying to understand the benefits and harms from the drilling boom need comprehensive details about complaints, even if some cases are from natural causes. In Pennsylvania, the raw number of complaints 'doesn't tell you anything,' said Rob Jackson, a Duke University scientist who has studied gas drilling and water contamination issues. Jackson said he doesn't think providing more details is asking for too much. 'Right or wrong, many people in the public feel like DEP is stonewalling some of these investigations,' Jackson said of the situation in Pennsylvania. In contrast with the limited information provided by Pennsylvania, Texas officials supplied a detailed 94-page spreadsheet almost immediately, listing all types of oil and gas related complaints over much of the past two years. The Texas data include the date of the complaint, the landowner, the drilling company and a brief summary of the alleged problems. Many complaints involve other issues, such as odors or abandoned equipment. Scott Anderson, an expert on oil and gas drilling with the Environmental Defense Fund, a national nonprofit based in Austin, notes that Texas regulators started keeping more data on complaints in the 1980s. New legislation in 2011 and 2013 led to more detailed reports and provided funds for a new information technology system, he said. Anderson agreed that a lack of transparency fuels mistrust. 'If the industry has nothing to hide, then they should be willing to let the facts speaks for themselves,' he said. 'The same goes for regulatory agencies.'","Pollution has been confirmed in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia .

"Families taking to the road during the school half-term holidays are benefitting from a new price-war at supermarket petrol pumps. First, Asda announced that from today  it is reducing the price of their petrol and diesel by 2p a litre. Then Morrisons and Tesco announced they were following suit, also cutting petrol and diesel prices by up to 2p a litre from today. Scroll down for video . Price-war: Asda said its petrol would be going down to 120.7p a litre, with its diesel dipping to 124.7p a litre . Asda said its petrol would be going down to 120.7p a litre, with its diesel dipping to 124.7p a litre - its lowest prices since December 2010. Peter Cattell, fuel director for Tesco said: 'We'll be cutting the price of petrol and diesel by up to 2 pence per litre. As Britain's biggest fuel retailer, this means more motorists can make real savings.' Mark Todd, petrol director for Morrisons, said: 'Recent wholesale price drops have allowed us to pass these savings on to the customer.' AA head of roads policy Paul Watters said: 'These latest price moves are a timely boost for UK families as they see fuel consumption go up with the start of winter driving and the heating being switched on at home.' He added: 'Asda's latest price-drop follows a 5p-a-litre fall in wholesale petrol costs over the past fortnight. 'Average UK petrol prices last week were already mirroring a previous 5.5p-a-litre wholesale reduction since June. This cut the typical pump price from a summer high of around 131.5p a litre to below 126.0p last week.' 'Timely': The AA welcomed the price moves, saying that families will see fuel consumption go up with the start of winter driving and the heating being switched on at home. Above, file image . 'The big question is whether Sainsbury's, after its dramatic cut at the end of last month, follows suit. If so, this should help to drag down prices at other supermarkets and nearby retailers.' RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: 'This is not an unexpected cut as there is plenty of margin between wholesale and retail costs for prices to go lower still.

"President Barack Obama will embark on another fundraising trip today - his second since the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 - leading a top Democrat to join the chorus of lawmakers voicing concerns that the Commander in Chief's priorities are misplaced. Asked about Obama's three-day fundraising swing down the West Coast this week, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein said yesterday that the president ought to put more energy into working with the international community to tackle the conflicts in Syria and Iraq, the Ukraine and Gaza. 'This is a very hard time,' she told MSNBC. 'I’m not going to tell the president what to do, but I think the world would very much respect his increased attention on this matter, and I think there ought to be increased attention.' Campaigner in chief: President Barack Obama boards Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, just before flying off to Seattle, Washington, to fundraisers benefiting the Democratic Party . Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry is in Cairo, meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi trying to negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas . After learning of the Malaysia Airlines crash last week, the president grabbed a burger and gave two speeches to donors in New York. The White House said the president talked to the relevant world leaders on the phone during his trip to New York on Air Force One and spoke with Secretary of State John Kerry and his national security team on the ground before continuing on to the fundraisers. But that wasn't enough for Arizona Sen. John McCain, who sits on the Armed Services committee. 'I don't understand this president ... this is what we used to call in the military A-W-O-L,' McCain, a former military POW told Fox . News. 'There's a direct loss of American lives here . and the president goes to a fundraiser? Help me out.' It was later determined that only one American was among the 298 people killed with the plane that was shot down over the Ukraine but that information had not yet been disclosed at the time of McCain's remarks. President Obama will tie up rush hour traffic in Seattle, Washington, when he drops in today to raise money for the Democratic National Committee at former Costco CEO Jim Sinegal's water front home. Sinegal's home is the one in the middle . This afternoon President Obama will depart for Seattle, Washington, where he will stop by two events benefiting Democrats, then rush off to California for two more days of fundraising. The first fundraiser is being hosted by real estate mogul and former Obama campaign bundler Bruce Blume and his wife Ann. The White House repudiated a report yesterday from TMZ that President Obama would be appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Wednesday during his trip to Hollywood. White House press secretary Josh Earnest confirmed to the LA Times that Kimmel had invited Obama on the show but claimed the White House declined his offer. 'In advance of the trip, we've been in touch with Kimmel's folks about the president doing his show,' Earnest said. 'We elected not to do it this time, but hope we can arrange to do it in the near future.' The Democratic National Committee event will be held at their 10,000 square foot mansion in Seattle's Madrona neighborhood in the Puget Sound area. Roughly 250 guests will attend the event, with tickets costing $500 - $10,000 a person. The second Seattle event will take place at former Costco CEO Jim Sinegal's home at Hunt's Point and is co-hosted by Tom and Sonya Campion. Tom Campion is the founder of Zumiez, a clothing store for skaters. Sinegal spoke in favor of Obama's economic policies at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. The $25,0000 a head fundraiser is being held on behalf of Senate Majority PAC, a political action committee working to help Democrats keep control of the Senate. Obama will only be in Washington long enough to disrupt rush hour traffic before he flies off to San Francisco, where he plans to attend a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee event on Wednesday hosted by real estate developer George Marcus. Entry to the Los Altos Hills events ranges from $10,000 a person to $32,400 a couple. The following day he leaves the Bay Area for Hollywood. There, he'll attend two Democratic National Committee fundraisers - the first of which is at the Hancock Park home of Scandal creator Shonda Rhimes - and give a speech on the economy at the Los Angeles Trade-Technical College before retuning to Washington, D.C. on Thursday night. President Obama made an unscheduled stop at the Dutch embassy this morning to sign the country's condolence book. In his note Obama said: 'On behalf of the American people, I extend our deepest condolences to the people of the Netherlands as they mourn the loss of so many familyand friends. 'No words can adequately express the sorrow the world feels over this loss. It is made more acute by the deep ties of friendship between our two countries. 'Bound by that friendship, we will not rest until we are certain that justice is done.' Tickets to the Rhimes event, which is being co-hosted by Scandal star Kerry Washington, start at $1,000. Attendees who want to have their photo taken with Obama will have to pay the standard $10,000 a person fee. To be a host, one must max out to the DNC at $32,400. Obama is also slated to participate in a roundtable discussion with 30 Democratic donors at Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino's home before traveling he leaves Los Angeles. Tickets to the intimate event with the president are also $32,400. According to the Los Angeles Daily News, this week marks Obama's nineteenth trip to the L.A. area since he took office in 2009 and his third trip there in the last months. Before Obama's recent stretch of fundraisers, CBS News White House Correspondent Mark Knoller determined that Obama had attended 393 fundraisers from the time he took office through the beginning of July. At the same point in George W. Bush's presidency, Knoller says Bush had only appeared at 216. President Obama made an unscheduled stop at the Dutch embassy today to sign the book of condolence for the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 disaster . Typically, the president is greeted by Senator Diane Feinstein when he travels to California, as pictured here in November. Feinstein won't be on hand today when the president visits her home state, however. Feinstein said yesterday Obama ought to pay 'increased attention' to global conflicts . The White House pushed back on suggestions yesterday that the President Obama should consider cutting back on his fundraising schedule until conflicts abroad die down. 'As was demonstrated last week when the . President was on the road and two of these crises flared up, the . President was able to fulfill his responsibilities as Commander-in-Chief . and as the leader of this country from the road,' White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. 'The President’s top priority and the top priority of the staff here at the White House,' Earnest said, 'is making sure that the President is able to do his job in terms of managing the United States’ involvement in these crises. ' Earnest noted that Obama travels with staff and communications equipment and 'fulfill his responsibilities' from anywhere. 'And if it becomes clear that there’s a need for him to come back to the White House in order to fulfill those functions, then we’ll make a change in his schedule,' Earnest concluded. 'Right now it’s not apparent that that’s the case.' Likewise, White House Communications Director,Jennifer Palmieri the told The New York Times: 'It is rarely a good idea to return to the White House just for show when the situation can be handled from the road.' House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told MSNBC's Mike Barnicle yesterday that she doesn't think the president is 'kind of remote,' as he put it, but if others do, that signals a problem. 'While I disagree with the characterization, if that’s the impression people have, then communication has to be stepped up,' she said.","President Barack Obama will attend a string of events in Washington in California benefiting Democrats throughout the next three days .

"You might worry about being called Scrooge if you serve a 25p mince pie at a Christmas party. But it seems that the budget pastries from Iceland are the best money can buy this festive season – beating high street rivals and even luxury versions from Harrods and Fortnum & Mason in blind taste tests. Food experts voted Iceland’s pies the best in an annual review of Christmas food, praising their ‘crumbly buttery pastry’ that was ‘generously filled with sweet, fruity mincemeat’. And at just £1.50 for a pack of six, the store’s Deluxe Mince Pies cost a fraction of those sold by their more exclusive rivals. Scroll down for video . A pack from Fortnum & Mason in London, which came in fifth place, costs eight times more at £12.95, while Harrods’s Luxury Almond and Brandy Mince Pies at £9.50 were down in twelfth position. Iceland’s buying director Nigel Broadhurst said: ‘We are delighted but not surprised to have been awarded the accolade for Britain’s best mince pie. ‘Many families are mindful of their budget over the festive period, but still want to enjoy good food. This award demonstrates that you can achieve both when shopping with Iceland.’ The accolade, in this year’s Good Housekeeping Institute Tried And Tested Christmas special, revealed the success of the British grocer in fighting back against the success of German giants Aldi and Lidl. The discount stores, which usually dominate the Christmas competition, struggled this year: Aldi did not make the top three in any of the 12 festive food and drink categories assessed by the Institute, which included stuffing, smoked salmon and brandy butter. Lidl claimed only one top spot, in the Stilton category, with its £1.69 Valley Spire Mature Blue Stilton. First place: Food experts voted Iceland’s pies the best in an annual review of Christmas food, praising their ‘crumbly buttery pastry’ that was ‘generously filled with sweet, fruity mincemeat’ Sweet treats: Marks & Spencer was crowned the king of  Christmas Cake (left) while Tesco won the best pud award with its £5 nine-month matured cherry topped Christmas pudding (right) In a surprise victory, Tesco, which has recently suffered a sharp fall in sales, won the best pud award with its £5 nine-month matured cherry topped Christmas pudding – described by judges as ‘well spiced, moist and full of flavour’. It beat 34 other entries, including a £24.95 classic version from Harrods, which was in 13th place. And Tesco, which has spent millions of pounds on improving the quality of its goods, also came in second for its Christmas Cake, cranberry sauce and stilton, and third for its yule log, stuffing and own label mulled wine. Marks & Spencer was crowned the king of Christmas, winning three first place awards – a quarter of the categories – with its Christmas Cake, turkey and cranberry sauce. Caroline Bloor, of Good Housekeeping, said: ‘Our top scorers show that price is no indicator of deliciousness. By comparing a wide range of foods, we can really say which tastes best and pass that knowledge on to shoppers.’","Iceland's 'generously filled' mince pies praised for 'crumbly buttery pastry'

"They are Peppa Pig biscuits that should probably come with a XXX rating. A bakery obviously saw the chance to jump on the bandwagon and dished up the treats for sale on its shelves to catch the eye of passing kids. But the snacks that came out of the oven, complete with a drooping pink nose, beady eyes and a beaming smile, might be considered unsuitable for children.

"One of the twin schoolgirls who followed their jihadi brother from Manchester to Syria has revealed she still wants to be a doctor - but for Isis. The 16-year-old has tweeted a slew of fanatical messages, reportedly including: 'I will become a doctor for Isis not for these pagans'. Salma and Zahra Halane, who have 28 GCSEs between them fled Chorlton, Greater Manchester, a month ago and are now believed to be based in Raqqa, Syria - an Isis stronghold. Scroll down for video . Aims: Salma and Zahra Halane, who have 28 GCSEs between them, have vowed to use their skills for Isis . But despite widespread efforts to bring them back, social media updates suggest the pair are training to use grenades Kalashnikov rifles. On a Twitter account believed to be controlled by either Salma or Zahra, messages mock media reports of their stellar school records, according to The Sun. 'Training to be doctors to Training to be killers... I will become a doctor for Isis not for these pagans', she tweets. It comes just days after it emerged Salma and Zahra Halane have allegedly married Isis fighters since relocating to Raqqa, Syria. An expert in extremism has checked the social media accounts and they are thought to be genuine. Shiraz Maher, an expert on radicalisation, told Newsnight last week: 'These women are saying they have chosen to go because they want to support fighters. Mocking: The girls have mocked media reports of their disappearance in tweets sent from Raqqa, Syria . The sisters were hard-working students who hoped to train as doctors. The pair achieved 28 GCSEs between them, but last month they left their parents’ home in the middle of the night and caught a flight to Turkey, before crossing the border. Police said the pair are thought to have followed their elder brother, who ditched his own ‘excellent’ academic career to join the ISIS terror group around a year ago. Friends said the twins had appeared to be typical teenagers, pouting for selfies and shopping at Primark – but they are now feared to be training for battle. Family ordeal: Visitors are pictured arriving at the girls' home in Chorlton as the family try to persuade them to come home. Their father has flown out to Syria in a bid to find them but he has so far been unsuccessful . Last month a rebel fighter boasted that he was teaching girls as young as 16 how to fight. Yilmaz, a Dutch national who has been in Syria for two years said: ‘It’s extremely easy to get here. People go on holiday ... they end up in Syria.’ The twins’ parents raised the alarm after finding the girls’ beds empty and their passports and clothes missing. A former neighbour said the couple had been ‘quite strict’, and did not allow the girls to ‘mix with other children on the street’.","Fanatical tweets posted on account by either Salma or Zahra Halane .

"Gilberto Martinez was . almost penniless when he left Cuba in 2005  to start a new life . in the United States. Eight years later he returned a rich man and built a large . house in his dusty neighborhood on the outskirts of Havana. Flush with money, he drove an Audi and a Mercedes and . started a music career under the artistic name 'Gilbertman'. But . two weeks ago, his flash lifestyle caught up with him when a swarm of Cuban police descended on his home and . arrested him. Boastful: The accused credit card fraudster, Gilberto Martinez, found living in Cuba, poses on Facebook with wads of cash on his biceps . Taking advantage: Like American music producers the videos he appeared in includes guns, strobe lights and scantily clad women . No taste: In the Cuban fugitive's rich video he says 'I have a lot of money in the bank,' he croons while throwing piles of cash around . 'It was dramatic. There were dozens of cops, in cars, sirens . blaring. They blocked off the street,' said one neighbor who . asked not to be identified. It is not clear what charges the 28-year-old Martinez faces . in Cuba but, whatever they are, the U.S. government also wants . to bring him in. Florida court records show he is a fugitive and faces up to . 16 years in prison after he was indicted on Sept. 30 in a Secret . Service credit card fraud probe involving $150,000 of purchases . at stores including Toys'R'Us and Babies'R'Us. In recent years, dozens of Medicare, credit card and . mortgage fraudsters who came to the United States from Cuba have . avoided prosecution by jumping bail and fleeing to their . homeland. Under President Obama's new Cuba policy, the fraudsters, who . have cost U.S. tax payers hundreds of millions of dollars, could . finally come under the long arm of U.S. law. Talks aimed at restoring diplomatic relations after decades . of hostility began this week in Havana, and U.S. officials say . issues of legal cooperation will be raised in the months ahead. Show-off: The young music artist publicly flaunted his riches: a spacious new house, a fleet of motorcycles and luxury cars, designer clothes and stately furniture . Star status: He was wanted in the United States for stealing people's credit card numbers and ripping off stores across Florida . Caught: Cuban police earlier this month raided the gated home of a U.S. fugitive in the town of Guanabacoa, outside Havana . Justice: Cuban officials aren't talking, but pictures and video shot by neighbors show armed, SWAT-like teams standing guard outside Martinez's home . In the past there has been occasional cooperation regarding . low level fugitives, including a Florida couple repatriated in . 2013 after they kidnapped two small sons they had lost custody . of due to a drug arrest and fled to Cuba on a sailboat. 'We would hope to be able to expand some of that cooperation . in the future as more normal relations go forward, and to have, . frankly, a better relationship on that kind of issue,' a senior . State Department official said this week. 'We are starting to compile a list of those fugitives that . we believe may have flown back to their native country,' said . Barry Golden, spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service in Miami. 'But as you can imagine it's very hard to confirm if they . are there. It's not like we can call the U.S. embassy and ask . them - at least not yet.' Not so in the case of Martinez who posted dozens of photos . of himself in Cuba on social media. 'He's all over YouTube so we . can pretty much verify he is there,' said Golden, who confirmed . that Martinez has an outstanding federal warrant. For days after his arrest, Cuban police were stationed . outside his single story hacienda-style home occupying almost an . entire block, and several officers were seen inside apparently . conducting an inventory. It is not clear why Martinez was arrested or on what charges . and no mention was made of the raid in Cuban media. Cuba's . government does not usually comment on police actions. No tact: Martinez, 28, posted hundreds of pictures of himself on Facebook living in Cuba like a Hollywood celebrity . Arrogance: About a week ago, a Spanish-language station in Miami, featured news of Martinez's arrest, friends and fans on social media  began praising him . Their Cold War animosity means Cuba and the United States . have no extradition agreement or law enforcement cooperation . treaty, although that could change once diplomatic relations are . restored. Despite their differences, the two countries have for long . cooperated on immigration issues and drug trafficking. But . building closer law enforcement ties would still be a huge step . in Cuba's one-party system, where the police and the military . are under the control of the ruling Communist Party. The most prominent political fugitive in Cuba is Joanne . Chesimard who escaped a New Jersey state prison following her . life sentence conviction for killing a state trooper in 1973. But there are a host of others wanted for financial crimes. Since 2007, U.S. authorities have been cracking down on . Medicare fraud, arresting and charging about 2,000 people who . collectively have falsely billed more than $6 billion to the . government health program for the elderly and disabled. Most arrests were made in south Florida, often involving . Cuban immigrants. 'They have got it down to a science ... When they get caught . they know they can skip bail and get away to Cuba. It's their . business model,' said Carlos Fleites, the lawyer for Martinez's . girlfriend, Yuleidys Gonzalez Amaral, who is charged in the same . credit card fraud case. Fleites said the scale of the problem is hard for Cuba to . ignore. 'They have to cooperate somewhat if they want to have a . normal relationship. They know where everybody is on the island. They could round up everyone overnight and fill a plane and have . them in Miami in the morning. Hopefully judgment day is coming.' The FBI provided Reuters with a list of 64 south Florida . Medicare fugitives, all but six from Cuba, though the number . could be higher as some investigations may be under seal. Among them is Jorge Emilio Perez de Morales, wanted on . charges he laundered $238 million stolen from Medicare. Three brothers - Carlos, Jose and Luis Benitez - are accused . of running 11 Miami-Dade county clinics that swindled $110 . million from Medicare. South Florida judges are increasingly taking a harder line . on fraud involving recently arrived Cubans, refusing bond and . imposing tough jail sentences. Last week, federal Judge Federico Moreno ordered Gonzalez . Amaral jailed after she appeared in court on bond to change her . plea to guilty and offered to cooperate with prosecutors. 'There are too many people who have fled,' Moreno said. Lavish lifestyle: Martinez built a large, white house with pool and hot tub, marble floors, and wraparound porch — then walled it off from neighbors . Breaking the rules: Martinez's mistake is that he lived too openly and too ostentatiously for a communist state . Out of time: In the past, Cuban-born criminals escaped to the island with their riches, well out of reach of American authorities - but now the past is catching up to Martinez .","Gilberto Martinez Suarez is wanted on major credit card fraud charges .

"This is the older brother of the missing British twins who ran away from their Manchester council house to Syria to become 'jihadi brides'. Ahmed Halane, 21, is believed to have gone to the war-torn country last year to fight with terror group ISIS, and is now banned from returning to the UK. Two weeks ago his twin sisters Salma and Zhara, both 16, who have 28 GCSEs between them, sneaked out of their bedrooms during the night two weeks ago and boarded a flight to Turkey. They are then thought to have travelled overland to Syria and called their parents to say: 'We’re not coming back'. Scroll down for video . Champion: Ahmed Halane, 21, whose twin sisters have followed him to Syria, is an expert at memorising the Koran and has appeared in YouTube videos viewed by thousands online . On the run: Salma (left) and Zahra Halane (right), who last summer achieved 28 GCSEs between them, left their parents’ home in the middle of the night and caught a flight to Turkey, before crossing the border to Syria . New videos have revealed their brother Ahmed had achieved some  fame for his ability to memorise and sing the Koran, which started at the age of five. Some of the films, viewed by tens of thousands on YouTube, show him competing in contests across Britain and even in Dubai, where he has won prizes of around £500. In one film he describes how he had started memorising texts from the religious book from the age of five. In the video, Ahmed, who was born in Denmark but moved to England when he was aged nine, says: 'When I came here to the UK that's when things got a bit more intensive. 'My father opened a school in Bolton, it was quite intensive. Six days a week we used to go. Sometimes four hours a day. 'Friday used to be our day off.' He adds how he progressed from learning one page of the Koran a day 'to five or six pages', describing it as 'a journey'. And by the age of 13 he had memorised the whole book. Later he admits he got married at 18 which 'helped him very much' to 'get better' at it. MailOnline understands that he also has a child. But shortly after the video was filmed last summer he fled to Syria to fight with ISIS. Discussion: Ahmed Halane talks about his life in Denmark and then the UK, before revealing he married at 18 . Police probe: Officers were seen leaving the house. The large back and front gardens were strewn with discarded household items and children's plastic toys . Police have said the twins 'potentially pose a threat to themselves and the community'. Dr Abdelaziz Belattar, 53, who helped organise the competition for the Muslim Association of Britain, said their brother led prayers at the Al Furqan Mosque in Moss Side, where the twins’ father was said to teach the Koran. Dr Belattar, from Hulme, Manchester, said: ‘Ahmed had a good voice and used to lead prayers at a local mosque during Ramadan. I told him that he had the attributes of a good Islamic teacher, particularly as he could recite the Koran.’ Dr Belattar said Halane had told him he had been studying Islam in Denmark, and planned to complete his studies at a university in Egypt. But he said the student had disappeared since the video was filmed last summer. ‘I assumed he Ahmed had gone to Eygpt as I have not seen him since at the mosque or around Manchester’, he said. ‘He was not extremist at all in his manner. I can’t believe his family could be caught up in anything like this.’ In the video, Ahmed says his father and other family members can all recite the Koran. He said he started memorising it a page at a time when he was 5 and he could recite the whole book by age of 13 – learning at group sessions after school or mosque six days a week. He said he started teaching other children at the age of 16 and recites the Muslim holy book every 10 days to help it stay in his mind. Dr Bellatar did not know the rest of Ahmed’s family. It is not clear whether he is the brother said to have inspired the twins to become jihadist fighters.","Ahmed Halane, 21, is now banned from the UK for going to Syria to join ISIS .

"Ukip has surged into the lead in the European election contest despite a bruising week of controversies, a poll revealed today. Nigel Farage's party recorded 31 per cent support in YouGov research for a Sunday newspaper, three points ahead of Labour, with the Tories languishing in third on 19 per cent. It is the first time the company has given Ukip an outright advantage in the race, with ballots due to be cast in less than a month. Scroll down for video . Research: Nigel Farage's party recorded 31 per cent support in YouGov research for a Sunday newspaper . The results in the survey for the Sunday Times revealed today are in line with a ComRes poll for the Sunday Mirror and Independent on Sunday last month. That put Ukip on 30 per cent, Labour on 28 per cent, and the Conservatives on 21 per cent. The findings suggest Mr Farage has not sustained significant damage from furores over his expenses, ‘racist’ posters, criticism of misleading campaign literature and dubious comments from activists. Former Tory donor Paul Sykes, said to be worth £650million, has pledged to plough more money into Ukip after funding one poster campaign. He told the Sunday Times there would be ‘at least another two waves’ of adverts before the European elections. ‘I'm not giving up,’ he said. ‘That will warn the Conservatives what is going to happen. We will get more democracy in Britain if it skints me.’ Behind: Ukip are three points ahead of Ed Miliband's (left) Labour, with David Cameron's (right) Conservatives languishing in third on 19 per cent . The poll, which put the Liberal Democrats on 9 per cent and Greens on 8 per cent, came as another Ukip candidate was facing a backlash after suggesting comedian Lenny Henry should emigrate to a ‘black country’. 'I'm not giving up. That will warn the Conservatives what is going to happen. We will get more democracy in Britain if it skints me' Paul Sykes, Ukip donor . William Henwood, who is standing in a . council election, made the comment in response to a speech by Henry in . which he said ethnic minorities were under-represented on British . television. Separate ComRes . research for the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) has highlighted . disaffection among voters with European institutions. Some 59 per cent believe the European Parliament does not represent the views of voters, with the number rising to 68 per cent among those aged over 55. More than half of 18 to 24-year-olds are not planning to cast a ballot next month. Helping hand: Former Tory donor Paul Sykes (left, with Mr Farage), said to be worth £650million, has pledged to plough more money into Ukip after funding one poster campaign . ERS chief executive Katie Ghose said: ‘This year's European elections are receiving an unusual amount of attention. 'We already know that nearly three-quarters of Britons feel their voice doesn't count in the EU and it looks like the problem is getting worse' Katie Ghose, Electoral Reform Society . ‘With Ukip's rising popularity, the TV debates between Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage, and the Conservatives' promise of an in-out referendum, European politics has seldom been so prominent. ‘And yet these results show that people still feel alarmingly distant from European affairs. ‘We already know that nearly . three-quarters of Britons feel their voice doesn't count in the EU and . it looks like the problem is getting worse, not better.

Meanwhile, Ukip launched an investigation into another of its aspiring politicians last night after apparently homophobic and racist comments came to light. On March 29, the day gay marriage was made legal in the UK, Robert Bilcliff, who is standing to be a councillor in Tamworth, Staffordshire, took to Twitter to declare: ‘Sad day for all us straight people.’ A separate Facebook post in July 2012 allegedly made a joke against Muslims. Mr Bilcliff admitted he could see how his comments could be viewed as homophobic and racist, but said he was neither. A UKIP spokesman said the matter had been referred to the party’s national executive with a view to disciplinary action. Last week builder Andre Lampitt, seeking to become a councillor in Merton, south London, and who featured in a UKIP election broadcast, was suspended after making racist remarks on Twitter that the party said were ‘repellent’.","Ukip is three points ahead of Labour while Tories are in third on 19% .

"Africa Cup of Nations hosts Equatorial Guinea made it through to the semi-finals for the first time in their history but the game ended in carnage in Bata on Saturday night. The Equato-Guineans beat Tunisia thanks in part to a controversial stoppage-time penalty, which took the game to extra-time. Referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn was then chased from the pitch by the Tunisian players after Javier Balboa had won the game for the home side, with one player aiming a kick at the official. Scroll down for video . Referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn is shielded from angry Tunisia players by security personal . The Tunisia players continue to hassle referee Rajindraparsad following the full time whistle . Security guards escort Seechurnaway from the field of play following the full time whistle . Equatorial Guinea's coach Esteban Becker tries to stop an argument between players . Police officers detain a fan of Guinea on the pitch after Javier Balboa scored against Tunisia . Eventually riot police had to intervene to usher the hapless ref down the tunnel. As the teams left the field missiles were thrown from the crowd at the visiting players, one of whom picked up a bottle and hurled it back into the crowd. It had been a bad-tempered game from the start, with Tunisia’s play violent and Seechurn completely unable to manage the occasion. But for a game lacking in any flow or quality, it more than made up for it with late drama and a spine-tingling atmosphere. Guinea's defender Rui (C) argues with Tunisia's players at the end of the match . With seconds of stoppage time remaining and the hosts trailing 1-0, Ivan Bolado went down under a seemingly innocuous challenge in the box. But, inexplicably, a penalty was awarded to take the game to the additional half hour. The 40-000 fans packed into the Estadio de Bata were excitable and raucus long Seechurn pointed for the last-gasp spot kick, and when Javier Balboa stepped up to convert in from the spot it felt like they might bring the stadium down. But that was nothing compared to the noise when the same man, once a trainee at Real Madrid, curled in a beauty of a free kick from 25 yards in extra time. Despite the controversial decision, there was little sympathy for Tunisia, a side set up to contain rather than create, and whose energies were as much directed at kicking their opponents as the ball. Tunisia's defender Bilel Mohsni and Equatorial Guinea's defender Igor Engonga (right)come to blows . Indeed, had Seechurn not completely lost control of the game long before the equalizer, the Tunisians could have been reduced to 10 men, or even fewer. That the game ended with a brawl including both dugouts and several players was absolutely no surprise. Tunisia had gone ahead through Ahmed Akaichi, but the striker was one of those who was fortunate to be on the pitch when he converted Manza Mathlouthi’s cross in the 70th minute. Akaichi had lunged, dangerously and unnecessarily, at the Equato-Guinean keeper Felipe Ovono just minutes before scoring what had looked to be the winning goal. Aside from his goal Tunisia created next to nothing, Ovono making one serious save, and even then it was exaggerated, perhaps for the camera, or perhaps to life his own boredom. At the other end, for all their nice interplay, the home side didn’t make too many clear-cut chances. Guinea's midfielder Ivan Esono challenges Tunisia's midfielder Yassine Chikhaoui before things got heated . Middlesbrough’s Emilio Nsue might have scored when he went through on goal, only to be denied by Hamza Mathlouthi, but for the most part it was a game of high tempers rather than high-tempo football. That mattered very little though, after Balboa’s stunning double. Like the tournament itself – moved from Morocco at the last minute - we may not have arrived at the end point in an ideal manner, but few could deny it was the right one. But it will be overshadowed by the shameful scenes that followed, with Tunisia in particular unlikely to escape serious punishment.

"A lioness that had been found living in a mechanic's workshop in Mexico suffered such appalling treatment by her owner that she died from her injuries. Eitan Hernandez, 44, had pulled out the lioness' teeth and claws in order to keep her as a pet in his workshop in Tlaquepaque, in the central-western Mexican state of Jalisco. The lioness, christened Madonna by her cruel owner, weighed just 88lbs, less than a third of a normal adult lioness, and had open wounds on her back and legs. Cruel: Madonna the lioness was found malnourished and injured in a mechanic's workshop in central Mexico . Horrifying: The lioness, thought to be around 19 years old, weighed less than a third of a normal adult lioness, and had open wounds on her back and legs . A lion has an average lifespan of 29 in the wild, and around 13 in captivity. According to papers found in Mr Hernandez's home, Madonna was 19 when she was rescued . Madonna  was rescued along with a lynx by officials from local animal rights group, Federal Attorney for Environmental Protection (Profepa). Profepa had managed to find a new home for Madonna in the United States, but the lioness was unable to recover from her injuries and died . 'The animal was in an appalling condition and being kept in an entirely inappropriate location,' Profepa spokesman Eugen Lozada Zamudio said. 'It was not only suffering from malnutrition and severely underweight, but it also had open wounds on its back and on its legs. Named and shamed: Madonna's owner, 44-year-old Eitan Hernandez from Tlaquepaque in Jalisco, had pulled out her teeth and claws in order to keep her as a pet in his workshop . Heartbreaking: A local animal rescue group had found a new home for Madonna in the United States, but the lioness was unable to recover form her injuries and died . Some justice: Hernandez may face a fine over his cruel treatment of Madonna the lion and a lynx, which was also rescued from his workshop . 'In many places it had lost large patches of hair, and worst of all we found that at some stage its claws and its incisors had been pulled out presumably to make it less likely to harm its owners.' Mr Zamudio added: 'She had difficulty walking because she had been in a cramped space for so long. 'The lynx which we recovered was also having difficulty moving because in contrast to the lion it seemed to have eaten too much and was severely overweight.' Both animals had been transferred to the Biopark Rescue Unit Coexistence Pachuca where vets tried to bring them back to health. The lynx is reportedly doing better. The African lion is classified as an endangered species in Mexico for which paperwork is needed, and Eitan Hernandez may face a fine over his treatment of Madonna the lion and the lynx. It is not the first time Mexican authorities have recovered an animal without claws and teeth. Earlier in the year a bear named Invictus died after he was recovered from a circus cage and found to have lost his jaw through an infection caused by the fact his teeth had been pulled out.","WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES .

"Former mayor: Officers with search dogs swooped on the home of Cllr Jonathan Farmer (pictured) A Conservative former mayor and veteran army reservist has been dramatically arrested in an early-morning police raid and charged with owning a live 70-year-old Nazi wartime gun. Officers with search dogs swooped on the home of Councillor Jonathan Farmer, 56, of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, and seized a German Walther PPK pistol dating back to the Second World War. Police said they were acting on a tip-off and had a warrant to search his home for firearms. He will appear in court next Monday and could face a five-year jail sentence if found guilty. Farmer - whose wife Susanah is acting town clerk of Wisbech - has temporarily stepped down from helping to run the local army cadet force. He told the Fenland Citizen: ‘It was given to me by a friend, mainly because his wife wanted it out of the house. I just kept it in a cupboard. ‘When he gave it to me, he said not to fire it because it had been deactivated. He said it would blow my hand off, so I never did and I assumed it was pretty safe. ‘But I suppose I shouldn’t have kept it. It was a sentimental thing - and it’s a beautiful piece of engineering. My life as it was has been pretty much eviscerated.’ The Walther PPK handgun was a gift to the bomb disposal expert from a British veteran of the Battle of Monte Cassino in Italy in 1944. The soldier took the deadly weapon, a much-treasured war souvenir, from a captured German officer, and Farmer – the former mayor of Wisbech - has owned it for 30 years.

"Aussie sport stars spent their whopping pay cheques wisely last year by investing in multi-million dollar luxurious homes to comfortably live in with their families. Some of Australia's biggest male sportsmen splashed out on properties in Sydney's exclusive eastern suburbs with uninterrupted million-dollar ocean views. However, it wasn't all about buying property in 2014 with many sporting champions selling up before moving onto an even more extravagant place to call home. Proving that even A-listers are not immune from the unpredictable property market - not all of the sporting legends made a profit from their sales. Scroll down for video .

In a slightly more modest move, Sydney's glamorous power couple Anthony Minichiello and Terry Biviano bought a run-down  property for more than $3 million, also in Vaucluse. The new neighbours to The Clarke's sold their  waterfront Bondi Beach penthouse, also in Sydney's eastern suburbs, for nearly $2 million in July.

"In a picture that looks like it could have been lifted from a family photo album, mother Sally Jones and her partner cradle her new-born son. But ten years later the mother-of-two fled from Britain to Syria to join bloodthirsty ISIS militants. The new image shows Muslim convert Jones, 45 - who spent a lifetime on benefits - looking lovingly into the camera as she holds her baby boy, just hours after he was born on December 19, 2004. Scroll down for video . The new image shows Muslim convert Sally Jones, 45, looking lovingly into the camera as she holds her baby boy with her former partner, just hours after the baby was born on December 19, 2004 . A picture posted on Twitter appeared to show mother-of-two Jones wielding an AK-47 assault rifle . She is seen sitting next to former partner, believed to be the baby's father, as she tenderly clasps her bundle of joy at Medway Hospital in Kent. Three thousand miles away Sunni militants had just claimed responsibility for killing 22 people during the bombing of a US-base in the Iraqi city of Mosul. The troubles of the Middle East must have felt a world away from this touching family moment. Yet ten years on this Jones, who now calls herself Sakinah Hussain, is part of jihadist group ISIS - and is believed to have taken her son with her. Jones is thought to have sneaked into Syria at the end of last year after an online romance with Junaid Hussain, a 20-year-old hacker turned militant from Birmingham, and is believed to live in the city of Raqqa. Last month she ranted on Twitter about how she wanted to behead Christians with a 'blunt knife', and revealed that she had married  Hussain because Britain and America were 'terrorist' nations. She has posted a series of chilling threats on social networking sites and posed for photos wielding an AK-47 assault rifle while dressed in black with her face veiled. She warned on Twitter: ‘You Christians all need beheading with a nice blunt knife and stuck on the railings at Raqqa... Come here I’ll do it for you!’ Almost 10 years on, she now calls herself Sakinah Hussain, and is part of evil jihadist group ISIS . Jones has renamed her youngest son and taken him from Chatham, Kent, to Raqqa, Syria . She has renamed her youngest son, but her eldest son, now 18, has decided to remain in the UK. The militant claims her husband Junaid and friend Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary were not involved in the beheading of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. She added that her online threat to behead Christians was just a response to online abuse. Jones is an unlikely Islamic convert and even more unlikely member of the terrorist militia. In the early 1990s she was the lead guitarist in an all-girl rock band called Krunch who played a series of gigs in the South East. A clip of one of her performances posted online shows her with a shock of blonde hair and wearing a leather mini-skirt. In recent years she developed an interest in art, attempting to sell fantasy pictures as well as T-shirts, mugs and key rings through a niche website. She adopted several online personas such as Skya and Catgel, and contributed to forums on conspiracy theories, witchcraft and black magic.

Jones claims to have married Junaid Hussain, a computer hacker from Birmingham who has also joined ISIS militants in Syria . One bizarre picture showed her dressed as a nun while pointing a large handgun. She later forged an online romance with Hussain, who was the leader of a computer hacking group known as Team Poison. Last month her brother Patrick, 52, who runs his own paving company, said his family were deeply shocked by her conversion to radical Islam. Speaking at his £500,000 home in Oxted, Surrey, he said: ‘This is a very upsetting and distressing time for my family and I just don’t want them to be a part of it. She fell in love and went away.’ Earlier this month, David Cameron unveiled controversial new plans to crack down on jihadists bringing bloodshed to Britain’s streets. He vowed to introduce measures to bar home-grown fanatics fighting in the Middle East from re-entering the UK, either by stripping them of their passports or stopping them boarding flights back home. It has been reported that as many as 30 British jihadis are looking at ways of returning to the UK after losing faith with the brutal cause, but fear being imprisoned.","Image shows Jones lovingly cradling her son just hours after his birth .

"Gunned down with an AK47 as baying villagers cheer in delight, this is the shocking moment a burqa-clad woman was executed in Afghanistan for her part in a Taliban love triangle. The 22-year-old woman, said to have been married to a member of a hardline Taliban militant group, was shot dead after being accused of adultery with a Taliban commander. Horrific pictures show a crowd of bearded men gather to watch a rifle-wielding gunman shoot her in the head and back during the execution in Qimchok village, in Afghanistan's Parwan province. A woman, named as 22-year-old Najiba is shown sitting at the edge of a ditch wearing a grey veil, in the right hand corner a man seem to be filming something out of frame . A man wearing white clothes and an orange beret appears pointing an AK47 rifle at her . The man opens fire at Najiba at point blank range as she is sitting with her back towards him . Amateur footage of the brutal killing . shows the woman, known only as Najiba, slump to the floor, as dozens of . men on a nearby hillside cheer, 'God is great!' The unidentified shooter, who is seen . wearing an orange pakol (the traditional Afghan hat), swiftly executes her - but continues to shoot . her dead body whilst walking towards it. Officials in Afghanistan said the killing came about due to a dispute between two Taliban members, who had argued over the woman. Parwan province governor Abdul Basir Salangi told CNN that as both Taliban men 'had some kind of relationship with the woman', they instead opted to accuse her of adultery to 'save face'. The man continues to fire the AK47 rifle at Najiba's dead body as she lies at the place of execution on the outskirts of a village in the Parwan province, north of Kabul . A large crowd of bearded men in traditional clothing had gathered in the Qol village to watch the execution of the 22-year-old woman . Possibly satisfied with his work the executor walks away from her dead body after she was killed as a punishment for alleged adultery . The harrowing images came from an . undated video, although it is thought the Afghanistan execution took . place some time in late June. The video was handed over by a Qol . villager to the Parwan provincial government, situated north of Kabul, . their spokeswoman Roshna Khalid told AFP today. It is understood that both Taliban commanders have subsequently been executed. The video has been condemned by the Afghan government as un-Islamic and inhuman. Public executions of alleged adulterers were common when the Taliban regime was in power. They were in control of the country from 1996 until 2001, when they were ousted by a US-led invasion for harbouring Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks.","Burqa-clad woman is shot dead in front of baying villagers 'after affair with Taliban commander'

"A Nigerian heiress, whose father is said to be one of the world’s wealthiest men, has set her sights on becoming the next Rihanna. Ambimbola ‘Bim’ Fernandez, the daughter of gemstone entrepreneur and former UN ambassador Antonio Deinde Fernandez, has celebrated the release of her first single by sitting down for an interview with the New York Post. The 24-year-old, who is based in New York, told the paper that she has embarked on her career without the help of her dad, who is reportedly worth a staggering $8.7 billion. The heiress: Ambimbola 'Bim' Fernandez, 24, is the daughter of one of the world's wealthiest men who has been valued at $8.7 billion . She did, however, admit that he gives her a hefty monthly allowance which pays for her luxury Manhattan apartment among other living expenses. Speaking to the paper in her New York City home, which is flanked by original artworks by Picasso and Dr Seuss, Ms Fernandez explained: ‘I think that, unfortunately, everyone’s perception of socialites has been pretty accurate so far, which is what I want to change.’ Miss Fernandez’s first single ‘Let’s Take It Naked’ was released today on SMH Records’ site, with an iTunes roll-out expected soon. She cites Rihanna as one of her biggest musical inspirations. ‘Money can’t buy a record deal,’ she said of her situation. ‘It can’t buy good music. You can either sing or you can’t.’ 'Unfortunately, everyone’s perception of socialites has been pretty accurate so far, which is what I want to change' A song about nakedness is perhaps a little more explicit than what one would expect from a well-heeled socialite, but Miss Fernandez says that ‘it’s not even that racy of a song! 'It’s very poppy, like, “I think you’re cute! Do you like me? So let’s get naked!” I want it to be that song where it’s like, “Turn that song on! Let’s get ready! Let’s do shots!”’ In November, she signed her record . deal with SMH and is now topping off negotiations for her reality TV . pilot called Gold Blooded to be picked up by a major network. Her only prior professional music . experience was a vocal cameo in Cobra Starship’s 2009 album Hot Mess – a . feature she booked after meeting the band’s lead singer Gabe Saporta . backstage at a show. Her record label says that Miss Fernandez has not put any of her own money into the music project. In fact, Miss Fernandez appears to be more down to earth than one would expect. She told the New York Post that she grew up not knowing how rich she was. She attended college at Oxford Brookes University in England for just a few weeks before dropping out because 'everyone was way too snobby - I couldn't do it,' she said. Singing career: Ms Fernandez has embarked on a singing career, and counts Rihanna as one of her biggest musical inspirations . Judging from Twitter, it seems that Miss Fernandez even enjoys a good bargain. In July she tweeted: 'Favorite time of the year. 80% off sales everywhere!' Miss Fernandez is actually very active on Twitter, where she currently has more than 35,000 followers. She has used the social networking site to keep her fans informed of her record's progress, as well as her reality show. Her father, 80, owns four residences: . A mansion in Larchmont, New York (where Miss Fernandez also resides), a . home in Brussels, a palace in Nigeria, and a French chateau that was . once owned by Napoleon. Mr Fernandez is apparently transported between each of his homes on one of his three private jets. While he was born of royal tribal blood, his fortune appears to be entirely self-made through a . series of diamond and gold mines across the Central African Republic. His family counted Nelson Mandela and Kofi Annan as good friends. When . Mr Mandela died late last year Miss Fernandez shared photos of her posed . as a young child with the former South African President. She wrote on Instagram: 'It is . with great heartfelt sorrow to receive the message of Uncle Mandela's . passing to glory. We, the Fernandez children have lost an exceptional . Uncle & the world, a great man. Rest in Peace. [sic]' Miss Fernandez's father is notably reclusive for fear of abduction and robbery. He . is so private that blog entries written about him across the internet . almost describe him as a mythical-type person. Figures regarding his . exact wealth, properties, and other assets appear to be widely rumored . and disputed. Some even say that he owns up to six private jets and will not eat in a restaurant unless the establishment is completely cleared out so that he can dine alone. 'People think I’m exactly like Paris . Hilton, that I do nothing... I hope . they’re not right' Miss Fernandez’s starkly different outlook on publicity and self-promotion has worried her father. ‘He’s . terrified because I’m his baby - especially with [me] revealing [my] . wealth. And me being alone in the country, he’s terrified of someone . kidnapping me and holding me for ransom,’ she said. ‘He also just doesn’t want people taking advantage of me because I have been sheltered my whole life.’ Last year, Miss Fernandez finally decided to see-out her life-long dream of a singing career after her mother, Aduke, died of colon cancer. Her illness followed a bitter divorce with Mr Fernandez, which became headline-making news for its very public division of assets, including their many mansions,. During the 2004 divorce, it came to light how Mr Fernandez and Aduke had never been legally married in their 20-year relationship, which was previously unknown to her. Mr Fernandez had not divorced his prior wife until 1990, meaning he was still married during their Nigerian wedding ceremony (and therefore it was non-legally-biding). Headed for TV too: Miss Fernandez is currently shopping her reality TV show pilot to be picked up by a major network . Despite Mr Fernandez's extreme wealth, reports say that he fought tooth-and-nail to protect his assets in his divorce from Aduke - even asking her to pay him back millions of dollars for the renovations made to their shared residences. At the time, an anonymous source told the Sunday Times: 'Aduke believes she spent 20 years married to a man that has become her enemy and that what she is going through now is an attempt to prevent her existing without him. 'He has been presented as an honorable person who can do no wrong, while Aduke is just the greedy wife. But the property in New York is owned jointly and the château is in her name.' Despite her legal battles, the Aduke tried to protect her children during her divorce. Abimbola appears to maintain a close relationship with her father, and tweeted about spending Christmas with him in Belgium. She sees her album's release as an opportunity to prove her own potential. ‘People think I’m exactly like Paris Hilton, that I do nothing, I don’t work for myself, I don’t take my own money, I just spend my dad’s money, and I’m a spoiled brat. I hope they’re not right.’","Ambimbola 'Bim' Fernandez, 24, is the daughter of reclusive gem tycoon Antonio Deinde Fernandez .

"Killer: Michael Adebolajo, 29, has launched an appeal against his whole life prison sentence, the Judicial Office has confirmed . One of soldier Lee Rigby's murderers has launched an appeal against his whole life prison sentence, the Judicial Office has confirmed. Michael Adebolajo, 29, together with Michael Adebowale, 22, mowed down Fusilier Rigby in car, before hacking him to death in Woolwich, south east London, in May last year. Adebolajo was condemned to die behind bars - with judge Mr Justice Sweeney saying the killer had 'no real prospect of rehabilitation'. However, Adebowale was sentenced to a minimum of 45 years in jail because of his younger age, mental health problems and 'lesser role' in the 25-year-old father-of-one's murder. Now, Adebolajo has launched an appeal against his whole life prison term - just weeks after his sibling claimed that the sentence was Islamophobic. The British-born extremists were sentenced at the Old Bailey in February for butchering Fusilier Rigby in broad daylight near Woolwich Barracks on May 22. At the time, the pair both claimed that they were ‘soldiers of Allah’ and were motivated by the plight of Muslims abroad to carry out the killing. During their sentencing, violence broke out in the Old Bailey dock and the killers began hurling abuse at the judge and fighting with prison guards. In extraordinary scenes, the two Muslim extremists yelled 'Allahu Akbar' and 'You (Britain) and America will never be safe' during their sentencing at the court in Central London. When sentencing Adebolajo and Adebowale, Mr Justice Sweeney told them: 'You each converted to . Islam some years ago. 'Thereafter you were radicalised and each became an . extremist, espousing a cause and views which, as has been said . elsewhere, are a betrayal of Islam and of the peaceful Muslim . communities who give so much to our country. Victim: Adebolajo, together with Michael Adebowale, 22, mowed down Fusilier Rigby (pictured) in a car, before hacking him to death in Woolwich, south east London, in May last year . Jailed: Adebolajo (left) was condemned to die behind bars - with judge Mr Justice Sweeney saying he had 'no real prospect of rehabilitation'. However, Adebowale (right) was sentenced to a minimum of 45 years in jail . 'You decided between you, and in order to advance your . extremist cause, to murder a soldier in public in broad daylight and to . do so in a way that would generate maximum media coverage, including . getting yourselves killed by armed officers who would be bound to attend . the scene in the aftermath of the murder - thereby expecting that you . would become martyrs and each gain a place in paradise.' Following the sentencing of Adebolajo, who has two children and four stepchildren, Fusilier Rigby's heartbroken relatives said 'justice has been served'. Shocking: A blood-drenched Adebolajo said he was a 'soldier of Allah' and was motivated by the plight of Muslims abroad to carry out the killing . Adebolajo and Adebowale chose the young soldier as their victim because he was wearing a Help for Heroes hooded top. They mowed him down in a car, before hacking at his limp body with a meat cleaver and knives in an attempt to decapitate him. Mr Justice Sweeney said he had chosen to give Adebolajo a whole life prison term because he was the leader of the murderous plot and had no hope of rehabilitation. However, in March, Adebolajo's brother, Jeremiah Adebolajo, said his sibling should not be forced to die behind bars - claiming that the judge had caved in to 'pressure' and 'gave the public what they wanted'. He added that his brother would 'pose no danger to the public' if realeased, and would 'lead a very productive life'. Whole-life terms have come under the spotlight recently after leading judges at the Court of Appeal ruled that murderers who commit the most 'heinous' of crimes can be sent to prison for the rest of their lives. A specially-constituted court declared that sentencing judges can continue to impose 'whole-life' tariffs in such cases. Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas said the court had held that the statutory scheme enacted by Parliament, enabling judges to pass whole-life orders, was 'entirely compatible' with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Sentencing in a number of high-profile criminal cases had been put on hold - including the terms to be handed out to Fusilier Rigby’s murderers - pending the Court of Appeal’s ruling, which was given in February. The ruling followed a successful appeal to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) by murderers Jeremy Bamber, Douglas Vinter and Peter Moore. Before impact: This CCTV footage shows a Vauxhall Tigra about to crash into Lee Rigby as he crosses the road . Murder: Adebolajo is caught on camera walking across the road, while Fusilier Rigby's body lies on the ground . Fight: During Adebolajo and Adebowale's sentencing, violence broke out in the Old Bailey dock and the killers began hurling abuse at the judge and fighting with prison guards. Above, a sketch of the pair in court . Last July, the ECHR held that there had been a violation of Article 3 of the European on Human Rights - which relates to inhuman and degrading treatment - on the basis that whole-life orders were not 'reducible'. The Strasbourg-based court did not say that whole-life sentences were incompatible with the Convention, but that there had to be the possibility of a review at some stage and that current laws allowing for release in exceptional circumstances were unclear. Ruling: Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas said the statutory scheme enabling judges to pass whole-life orders was 'entirely compatible' with the European Convention on Human Rights . But the Court of Appeal judges ruled that the Grand Chamber was wrong when it reached a conclusion that the law of England and Wales did not clearly provide for 'reducibility', saying that the domestic law 'is clear as to ""possible exceptional release of whole-life prisoners"".' A power of review arose if there were 'exceptional circumstances'. An offender was required to demonstrate to the Secretary of State that, although a whole-life order was just punishment at the time the order was made, exceptional circumstances had arisen since. The Secretary of State 'must then consider whether such exceptional circumstances justify the release on compassionate grounds', the judges said. Lord Thomas concluded: 'In our judgment, the law of England and Wales therefore does provide to an offender ‘hope’ or the ‘possibility’ of release in exceptional circumstances which render the just punishment originally imposed no longer justifiable.' On whole-life orders in general, Lord Thomas said the Court of Appeal did not read the Grand Chamber’s judgment 'as in any way casting doubt on the fact that there are crimes that are so heinous that just punishment may require imprisonment for life'. Those currently serving whole-life terms in England and Wales include Moors Murderer Ian Brady, who tortured and murdered children along with accomplice Myra Hindley, and serial killer Rosemary West.","Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 22, killed soldier in May 2013 .

"The French have amassed a proud history of protesting about more or less everything, but this must be a first. Thousands of residents of a small town are up in arms - because they want a new McDonald's. Citizens of the nation famous for fine wine and gourmet cuisine took to the streets after red tape stalled work on the fast food restaurant, which they said would create much-needed jobs. Big flak: More than 100 residents of Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise, near Lille, took to the streets yesterday to demand work resumed on a new McDonald's. Amid high unemployment they say it will provide much-needed jobs . McDo no more: The restaurant was almost complete when it was halted by planning regulations. McDonald's is an unlikely hit in France, with 1,300 restaurants. The French eat almost a billion burgers each year . Some 4,000 people joined a Facebook group to protest against the decision in Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise, near Lille, by local bureaucrats last week. A court in Lille had suspended construction work when the restaurant was almost finished, saying it did not comply with planning laws which reserved the land for industrial units. But outraged residents protested, saying the order would stall the town's economic development and prevent around 30 new jobs from being created. They called their Facebook group 'Oui oui au McDo' and 130 of them marched down the streets of the town yesterday with banners proclaiming: 'MANIF!!! (Demonstration) pour McDo'. Those marching included union members, unemployed residents and several pupils from the town's schools.

Responding to claims that the town . might simply have a hankering for hamburgers, one resident wrote: 'If . it's the junk food that's bad we'll have to shut the kebab and chip . shops in Saint-Pol.' Another said: 'Seriously, I have a better lunch at McDonalds'. Radical: Farmer José Bové was jailed for taking direct action against a McDonald's outlet in 1999 . The plea for jobs came amid a . political crisis in France, with a quarter of those who voted in . European elections last week choosing Marine Le Pen's far-right Front . National. Observers say the surge in nationalism has been prompted partly by the country's economic woes. Despite slight improvements in economies across Europe, the unemployment rate in France still stands at more than 10 per cent. National pride, however, has not stopped France embracing a fast food franchise which was born in America and once faced huge opposition. In 1999, farmer and anti-globalisation activist José Bové was jailed for three months after he ransacked a McDonald's in the southern French town of Millau. Riding to the prison in a convoy of tractors, the walrus moustache wearing cult figure declared: 'I am a victim of politically-motivated justice. 'I will continue the fight while I am behind bars.' Fast forward 15 years and the country has a staggering 1,300 McDonald's outlets, making it the second-largest Big Mac consumer in the world after the U.S. It is also the biggest consumer of burgers in continental Europe. Almost a billion burgers were sold in France last year - nearly half the sandwiches sold in the nation which created the baguette. How times change: Just 15 years ago, José Bové won popular support as he rode to prison on a convoy of tractors and declared a message against globalisation to a crowd of 800 supporters in southern France . Winning them over: The chain used the French cartoon hero Astérix and introduced the McBaguette . However, McDonald's achieved its success not through Americanisation but by appealing to French culture.

"Former Iraqi asylum seekers have been raking in millions of pounds by illegally sub-letting luxury London flats paid for by taxpayers, The Mail on Sunday can reveal today. The housing benefit claimants have been funded by the state to stay in lavish apartments in some of the capital’s wealthiest addresses. But rather than living there, the claimants have been renting them out to super-rich tourists for thousands of pounds a week. Scroll down for video . Palatial: The Art Deco Park West block, where flats have been sub-let to tourists for up to £3,000 a week . In one case, a family of six – who cannot be named for legal reasons – were being given £500 a week housing benefit to live in a £1 million flat near Hyde Park, which they then let out for up to £3,000 a week. Last week investigators swooped on 21 benefits cheats – the majority of whom were identified as Iraqi Kurds – at four expensive apartment blocks. They included Forset Court, a grand, nine-storey 1930s mansion building, and the Art Deco development Park West, both less than half a mile from Marble Arch. Properties in both blocks come with 24-hour security, manicured lawns and concierges. Luxury: Former Iraqi asylum seekers have been raking in millions of pounds by illegally sub-letting luxury London flats paid for by taxpayers . It is estimated the fraudsters have made more than £100,000 each by sub-letting the flats over a three-year period, while costing the taxpayer a quarter of a million pounds in housing benefit. Hany Hanna, an estate agent in Marylebone, said he had been aware of the scams for 20 years, but recently they had reached ‘epidemic’ levels. He said: ‘They come into my office asking which blocks are best to rent. Some of them will come to the UK with a piece of paper with instructions on how to do things. Westminster Council’s anti-fraud tsar, Councillor Lindsey Hall . ‘First you have to be pregnant, then go to the housing department – they give you a flat. ‘After you get the flat, you move into another place, give the [first set of] keys to an agent, he will find you a tenant and you’ll be making double whammy – money from the Government and making money from the flat the Government gave you.’ Westminster Council’s anti-fraud tsar, Councillor Lindsey Hall, said many of the families were former asylum seekers who had been granted refugee status. They receive up to £500 a week in housing benefit which they use to rent private flats in luxury blocks. They secure these tenancies through unscrupulous middlemen acting as estate agents, before moving into a cheaper flat. They illegally sub-let the more expensive taxpayer-funded apartment to wealthy Arab families holidaying in London from Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia. The Iraqi-born claimants and the crooked agents split the profits. The frauds are committed without the knowledge of the property owners, who receive the rent they are charging without realising their home is being let for much more. The 21 fraudulent benefits claimants Westminster recently apprehended have all had their housing benefit payments cancelled and face civil court proceedings to reclaim the money. But Ms Hall said it would be difficult to bring criminal prosecutions in most cases because of the high burden of proof councils need, which can be very costly. She added: ‘We are asking for a more rigorous system where the onus isn’t always on local authorities to spend tens of thousands of pounds and conduct months of work to prove that someone is claiming benefits fraudulently. ‘Tougher tenancy agreements would be a starting point, and a fully traceable, fully transparent money trail ahead of that agreement being put in place. ‘We need same rigour as in the private sector.’","Former Iraqi asylum seekers  raking in millions  by illegally sub-letting .

"Apple paid a paltry £10million in UK corporation tax in the last financial year, despite earning an estimated £6billion in the country over the period. It is the latest technology firm to be accused of avoiding UK tax, following Amazon and Google. Apple runs a significant operation from an industrial estate in Cork, in the Republic of Ireland, taking advantage of its ultra-low rate of corporation tax. Booming trade: A shopper leaves a London Apple store clutching bags of new iPads. However despite UK profits of £6bn the firm has paid just £10m in . tax . At just 12.5 per cent, the Irish charge is just over half the 24 per cent rate in the UK. The company also has an offshoot in the Caribbean tax haven of the British Virgin Islands. Documents from one of its two main UK divisions, Apple Retail UK Ltd, show it paid tax of just £3.79million on sales of more than £500million in the year to September 2010, the latest accounts available. Another subsidiary, Apple (UK) Ltd, paid £6.1million in tax on sales of just under £69million. Experts say Apple’s total sales in the UK are far higher, as many are logged elsewhere. They estimate revenues from Britain accounted for around 10 per cent of its £63billion worldwide figure for the year. The success of the iPhone and iPad has led analysts to predict that Apple will become the first trillion-dollar company. Its market value currently stands at $590billion (£370billion). However, the future could also bring . legal troubles. Apple is under scrutiny in the U.S., too, where its . financial operations are run from Nevada – a state known for its low . taxes and business-friendly approach. In . documents filed with American regulators, Apple said it paid U.S. corporation tax at a rate of 25.3 per cent – well below the statutory . level of 35 per cent – due to ‘undistributed foreign earnings’ that it . plans to hold ‘indefinitely’. The success of the iPhone, left, and the iPad, has led analysts to predict that Apple will become the first trillion-dollar company . Apple . has accumulated cash reserves of more than £60billion, around . £40billion of which is held in foreign subsidiaries that are beyond the . U.S. taxman’s reach. The company’s accounts for 2007 to 2009 are being examined by the Internal Revenue Service – the U.S. equivalent of HM Revenue & Customs. An audit of its federal income tax returns resulted in ‘certain adjustments’ being proposed, some of which it is appealing against. Apple did not respond to requests for comment on its tax arrangements in Britain. The controversy follows the news that Amazon is under investigation by HMRC. Amazon.co.uk’s latest accounts reveal that it did not pay any British corporation tax in either 2010 or 2011 after switching its European headquarters to Luxembourg, famous for its relaxed tax regime. The taxman is investigating Amazon’s affairs in the UK between 2004 and 2010. The website is facing similar probes in several other countries, including France, Germany, Japan and Luxembourg. Google, like Apple, has chosen Ireland as its home, and channels money through there and the Netherlands to the tax haven of Bermuda. A spokesman for the company said: ‘We have an obligation to our shareholders to set up a tax-efficient structure, and our present structure is compliant with the tax rules in all the countries where we operate.’","Runs a significant operation from Republic of Ireland where tax rates are almost half .

"Tragedy: Dawn Aubrey-Ward, a former RSPCA officer, was found hanged after she had given an interview critical of the organistion . The RSPCA is being scrutinised by the Charity Commission over claims that it uses intimidatory and bullying tactics, particularly when bringing prosecutions for animal cruelty. The Mail on Sunday has learned that the watchdog has written to various organisations and voluntary groups asking for specific examples of such behaviour by the RSPCA. The concerns are expected to be raised by the Commission at a meeting with RSPCA trustees. The incidents that have triggered the review include the suicide in May of Dawn Aubrey-Ward, 43, a former RSPCA inspector whose character and integrity the charity had publicly attacked. After she accused the RSPCA of unnecessarily killing healthy animals, the charity posted a critical statement about her on its website and she was besieged by hate mail, death threats and abusive telephone calls. The charity has also been accused of ‘hounding’ barrister Jonathan Rich, who defended hundreds of people it prosecuted. He claims he had to spend £1 million to protect himself against spurious complaints made to his professional body, the Bar Standards Board. His allegations are echoed by Norfolk vet Colin Vogel, who has appeared for the defence in numerous animal cruelty cases. He says the RSPCA attempted to discredit him with complaints to the Society of Expert Witnesses, the Law Society and the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. There have been scores of similar claims over recent years and a so-called Self Help Group has even been set up  for farmers and pet owners experiencing difficulty with the animal charity. Anne Kasica, a spokeswoman for the SHG, declined to comment on the Charity Commission’s action. However, in a blog post three weeks ago, she accused the RSPCA of ruining lives with its ‘heavy-handed investigations’ and said: ‘They prosecute the vulnerable, the elderly . . . Animals die in RSPCA care.’ The charity has also been criticised by the Countryside Alliance for using a large proportion of donors’ money on bringing cruelty prosecutions, as well as by a judge in a recent case. In the action against the Heythrop Hunt, in David Cameron’s Oxfordshire constituency, the judge suggested that even though the case was successful, the public might feel the £330,000 spent by the RSPCA ‘can be more usefully employed’. Cambridge-educated Jonathan Rich, who defended hundreds of people against the RSPCA over 20 years, said he has spent almost £1million defending professional allegations made by the charity . In a leaked document, the RSPCA’s own deputy chairman, Paul Draycott, revealed an estimated £3 million budget deficit this year and questioned the charity’s strategy. The Charity Commission denied there was a formal investigation into the RSPCA but confirmed that a new officer had taken over responsibility for liaising with it. A spokeswoman said the official ‘had been undertaking some fact-finding research. This involved corresponding with various parties about their experience with the charity’. She added that the officer could raise any problems with RSPCA trustees and that, if there were serious questions to be answered, a formal inquiry could be launched. Questions: RSPCA chairman Gavin Grant, right, pictured here with Queen guitarist Brian May, is expected to liaise with the charity watchdog . She said: ‘We are now taking the opportunity to meet personally with the trustees for an informal dialogue.’ A spokesman for the RSPCA said: ‘The Charity Commission has confirmed that it is not investigating.’ But Barney White-Spunner, the Countryside Alliance’s executive chairman, said it did not matter what the Commission called the talks: ‘It amounts to the same thing, an investigation or an enquiry. ‘We are very pleased that  the RSPCA’s role as a private prosecutor is being examined.’","Charity Commission to raise concerns in a meeting with trustees .

"Tempers flared and tears were shed as several people collapsed in an overcrowded New Jersey train station while waiting in long lines to get to the Super Bowl. Emergency medical workers pushed their way through the overheated, angry crowd to treat collapsed would-be Super Bowl revelers at Secaucus Junction on Sunday afternoon only hours before the big game. Long lines were brought to a standstill by temporarily installed airport-style security machines that failed to keep up with the volume of passengers taking transit to the Super Bowl as authorities had instructed. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Jame packed: Football fans make their way to trains at Secaucus station in New Jersey where several people collapsed . Long lines have come to a standstill in front of airport-style security machines that apparently cannot handle the crowd volume. People were squeezed together in an enclosed stairwell. Brrr: The temperature for tonight's game is expected to be about 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit . Threat: Authorities say that sometimes a sniper can be more effective than an agent on the ground A sniper is pictured at the 2012 Super Bowl in Indianapolis . K-9: In addition to the snipers, law enforcement officials will be using bomb-sniffing dogs to seek out any potential security threat . 'Absolutely pathetic, the NFL had 40,000 people coming on buses, they knew there was going to be 45,000 people coming out,' Tammy Ritchie, from Vancouver, Canada, told the Star-Ledger. 'We stood in line sweating, it’s absolute horse crap. As more trains arrived, police tried to thin the sweating, jostling crowd by spreading people across the platform. Initial fan calls of ""Seahawks"" and ""Broncos"" gave way to angry shouts of 'New Jersey, your Super Bowl sucks!' Law . enforcement officials in New York and New Jersey have ramped up . security in anticipation of Super Bowl XLVIII in East Rutherford on . Sunday, utilizing just about everything in their arsenals - including . sharp-shooting snipers - to protect those in attendance from any . possible terrorist attack. 'We were stuck in the tunnel for 30 minutes, it was probably 120 degrees,' said Jeff Dunbar, from Seattle. ‘People had to take their shirts off, it was not good... people were chanting ‘Jersey sucks’ and blaming Christie.' Adding to the confusion was the lack of communication between authorities and passengers. 'Nobody is telling anybody what’s going on...people are getting sick, they’re feeling claustrophobic, there’s no air in there, there’s no water,' said Bob Dowling, of New Providence, New Jersey. 'the wait is incredible, we were back there a good one hour and fifteen minutes.' The . Super Bowl is what national security officials consider a 'level one . national security event' and may be a target for terrorists because of . the level of attention paid to the game. The added security proved to be too much for many in the crowd to handle. 'It was 120 degrees in there with no air conditioning, everybody is drenched,' said Dave Mannon, of Dallas, Texas. 'They even had to send in medics because a few people passed out... I don’t think it’s working, I think Governor Christie’s at it again.' Choked: Fans are packed in tightly as they make their way down the stairs at NJ Transit's Secaucus Junction . Mass of humanity: People stood in lines of almost an hour to transfer from buses and trains to rides to MetLife Stadium - there is usually no wait even prior to Giants and Jets games . Locked down: Police officers view football fans as they traverse the crowds . The added security measures also include high-altitude snipers working with security agents on the ground to make sure everyone is safe. If you have an active shooter or you have anyone who may have a bomb. Snipers have a better angle then anyone who is on the ground to actually . hit that target. It’s an entire team that communicates. You have . individuals who are at high altitudes inside the arena and then you have . individuals that are on the ground moving in and around the crowd,' former FBI agent Jonathan Gilliam tells Fox News. Additionally, security officials are reviewing recent terrorist attacks in other countries to determine how to prevent them from happening in the U.S. 'Certainly, we're keeping an eye on activities around the world, but as of this time, there are no threats directed against this event that we're aware of,' New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton said a security briefing in Manhattan. Because this year's Super Bowl has the distinction of relying on mass transit to take up to 30,000 fans to the game, the deadly bombings in the southern Russian city of Volograd have raised worries here, said Col. Rick Fuentes, head of the New Jersey State Police. The suicide attacks on a trolleybus and a train station that killed more than 30 people within weeks of the Winter Olympics also prompted a series of meetings among the planners for Super Bowl security, he said. Everyone waits everywhere: Football fans who finally made their way through security checkpoints were then forced to endure waits to get on train to the game . Everyone waits everywhere: Football fans who finally made their way through security checkpoints were then forced to endure waits to get on train to the game . Capacity: People already are filing into MetLife Stadium for Super Bowl XLVIII in East Rutherford, New Jersey . Target: The Super Bowl is considered by security officials to be a 'level one national security event' Local officials are counting on the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security 'to keep an eye on and brief us on those events,' Fuentes said. 'There is a concern with mass transit and we've prepared ourselves for it.' Trains, buses and cars taking fans from New York and parts of New Jersey to the stadium and back again 'are going to be scanned, they're going to be checked, they're going to be swept,' he said. In Manhattan, the NYPD is drawing on its experience securing the annual New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square, the New York City Marathon, the U.N. General Assembly and other high-profile events to secure 'Super Bowl Boulevard,' a 13-block street fair on Broadway. The department has deployed hundreds of extra uniformed and plainclothes police officers to the area. It's also relying on bomb-sniffing dogs, portable radiation detectors and a vast network of surveillance cameras to detect trouble. In the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl, the NYPD rehearsed its response to a variety of potential threats, including 'the backpack left unsecured scenario,' Bratton said. 'We are very, very well-prepared.' The state police plan to assign up to 700 troopers at the stadium on Sunday, Fuentes said. A security center has been set up in a hollowed-out building across a highway from the stadium that's slated to become a mammoth retail and entertainment complex. A 24-hour FBI command center will monitor the latest counterterrorism intelligence, said Aaron Ford, head of the FBI's Newark office. Measures have been taken to protect power grids and to make sure there's plenty of backup energy in case of another blackout like the one last year at the game in New Orleans, said Jeffrey Miller, the NFL's head of security. 'This year we're going to try to go blackout free,' Miller said. 'One thing that I've learned is that you don't want to be overconfident. You want to prepare and be ready. You just don't know what you might face on game day.' Randy Killikevc, a tourist from Tennessee who attended a Super Bowl party in Byrant Park on Wednesday, said possible threats against the Super Bowl weren't on his mind. 'If terrorists were going to strike New York why not do it on New Year's Eve? There's lots more people here (then),' he said.","Security officials consider the Super Bowl a 'level one' security event that could be a potential target for terrorists .

"The perfect belly button is oval-shaped and vertically-oriented, according to the results of new research from a group of plastic surgeons. Surgeons at the University of Singapore's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, whose research was published in ASJ, analyzed images of 37 Playboy Playmates (really) to assess the ideal length, shape and position of the navel. With the help of a computerized tool called an 'Aesthetic Analyzer', they established that a perfect belly button has a ratio of 46:54, and a midline horizontal position. Navel gazing: Do Playboy Playmates such as Kennedy Summers have the ideal belly button? Surgeons at the University of Singapore analyzed images of 37 Playmates for a new study . The ideal length is 5per cent of the . length from the lower breastbone to the lower part of the vulvar cleft, . and the 'hood,' or flap, is very small. Study author Shu Jin Lee and . his colleagues had previously developed the software to analyze images . of the nose, breast and umbilicus. However, plastic surgeon Dr. Adam Rubinstein of Miami, Florida, tells Today.com that most people just want their belly button to be in the 'range of normal.' 'Using Playboy Playmates is kind of an arbitrary sample. Just because these women are considered beautiful doesn’t mean they have beautiful belly buttons,' he said. 'Most people just want their belly button to be in the range of normal' Belly button surgery, called umbilicoplasty, takes approximately 45 minutes. In 2011, Dr. Curtis Cetrulo Jr, a surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, told NBC News that most patients ask for 'a vertical dime slot of a belly button that's small and thin.' The procedure is sometimes performed as part of a tummy tuck, which may affect the belly button's shape. Previous research to develop a navel aesthetic took place in 2000 at the University of Missouri, where images of 147 female belly buttons were shown to a panel of 15 men and 6 women. According to Charles L. Puckett's journal article In Search of the Ideal Female Umbilicus, navels considered beautiful were small and vertically oriented, or T-shaped, while horizontal belly buttons were thought to be ugly.","Surgeons at the University of Singapore's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine analyzed images of 37 Playboy Playmates (really) to assess the ideal length, shape and position of the navel .

"A pair of British adventurers were celebrating last night after smashing two world records driving 10,300 miles from Cape Town to London - in a lightning fast 10-and-a-half days. Speedy Philip Young and Paul Brace shaved more than three days off the previous record for the route, crossing the finish line at Marble Arch at 5.30pm yesterday, just 10 days, 13 hours and 30 minutes after they set off from the South African city. Not only did the pair tear up that record, they also set the fastest time for doing the journey in either direction, beating a previous best set by Brits Mac and Steve MacKenney and Chris Rawlings, going from London to Cape Town in 2010. Record breakers: Philip Young, 53, (left) and Paul Brace, 50, (right) who have smashed two world records for the epic 10,300 mile drive from Cape Town to London . Flying the flag: The pair are pictured waving Union Jacks as they crossed the finish line in London's Marble Arch yesterday evening . Philip and Paul averaged 43mph along the route and covered more than 1,000 miles per day in a tiny 875cc Fiat Panda. Mr Young, 53, chariman of the Endurance Rally Association, said: 'The thought of reaching Marble Arch has kept us going rather than falling asleep from exhaustion. 'The best part of the whole trip is getting to London and knowing we have succeeded in our ambition and that nine months of planning has worked. 'The trip has been a real eye-opener. 'It has been one hell of an experience - tough and, at times, extremely gruelling. 'We have been effectively living in the car. Pretty much the only times we got out were for fuel stops and borders. 'But we have got no regrets about the Panda as a choice of car. 'It is one of the smallest cars you could possibly buy on the British market but it has been perfect, nippy and powerful enough to do the job of crossing two continents. 'On Sunday night, we had a big diversion up the right side of Italy because of snow. We have had just about every extreme along the way you could imagine. Tough terrain: Philip Young and Paul Brace are pictured here in the Panda passing an overloaded local truck in Africa . Long journey: The pair's route took them through 13 countries across two continents . 'But we have had a terrific amount of attention wherever we have gone with locals travelling halfway across their country to cheer us on.' They drove over 13 countries, including some of the world's most volatile, in two continents and their £7,000 Panda became the first car to cross from Sudan into Egypt over a new land frontier. Philip and Paul passed through Libya, even though the country's borders are officially closed to foreigners, but the Syrian uprising forced them to take a ferry from Tunisian capital Tunis to Sicily over the weekend. Even a combination of snow in southern Italy a delayed Eurotunnel train and rush hour traffic in London couldn't stop them writing their name into the record books. Raising more than £10,000 for the Farm Africa charity, which helps African farmers increase their harvest in a bid to tackle food shortages, Philip and Paul also passed through Botswana, Zambia, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Sudan among other countries. Difficult route: The pair broke the record despite encountering a few problems along the way. Mr Brace is pictured here looking under the Panda's bonnet as an armed soldier watches on in Africa . Philip said that the hardest part of the trip had been a stretch in northern Kenya, near the town of Marsabit, known as the ‘Road to Mars’. It runs through a desert, where the track disapears in places and is littered with huge potholes in others. He said: 'We had a long night picking our way through boulders the size of football.' But the biggest eye-opener was the Libyan city of Misrata, scene of the bloodiest fighting during the revolution that toppled Colonel Gaddafi in 2011. Philip added: 'We were driving around the streets at night with road checks every 500 yards or less. 'There were kids everywhere roaming around in pick-up trucks with machine guns. 'That was quite an experience.' Describing their arrival at the Libyan border on the pair's blog, Mr Young wrote: 'We have shaken hands with our new team - an armed guard will lead us, another armed guard will follow. River crossing: The adventurous pair are pictured here with the Panda crossing the Zambezi river from Botswana to Zambia by ferry . And they're off: Philip and Paul are pictured here at the very start of their trip in front of Cape Town's famous Table Mountain . 'Nobody seems at all bothered by the Union Jack across the front of the Panda... 'A chilling reminder of Libya’s recent past - as we waited for stamps in our passports, there were three muffled explosions. 'We ask the obvious question and back came the reply with a casual shrug of the shoulders - ‘People with no visas risk walking around the outside of the walls here, setting off land-mines’. 'Nobody left the queue in the shabby passport office to go and look. 'Suddenly, our passports are back all approved and we are on the move passing through a rusty gate. 'We are now driving into Libya - when plenty warned us it would prove to be a border too far, an immovable anvil which would see the hammer come down on our nine months of planning.' And in Ethiopia they almost suffered their 'worst nightmare' when they came close to running out of petrol because of a national shortage. Support: Locals created a banner welcoming the pair to Sudan . Mr Young, from Deal in Kent, and Mr Brace, a car restorer from Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, also faced tropical thunderstorms, river crossings and desert tracks along the way. They had been taking it turns to drive while the other ate food from Army-issue self-heating cans and tried to grab some rest on a child’s mattress laid across the back seat. The only tools they took to keep the car on the road were an adjustable spanner and a hammer along with a roll of gaffer tape and a tin of superglue. This year is the 80th anniversary of the first attempt to drive from London to Cape Town in a Morris Eight, a drive that took five months. Since then, many have tried to set the fastest time in vehicles ranging from a Wolseley 18/85, Austin A70, Hillman Minx, Humber Super Snipe and Ford Cortina. The previous record for the Cape Town to London route stood at 14 days, 19 hours and 26 minutes and was set by British Army officer Brigadier John Hemsley and his wife Lucy in 1983 - in a Range Rover V8. The record for completing the trek in the opposite direction stood at 11 days, 14 hours and 11 minutes.","Philip Young and Paul Brace crossed the finish line in London last night .

"Mark Zuckerberg has long been the target of Internet trolls, and on Thursday the billionaire Facebook founder finally had the chance to shut one down. Zuckerberg took to Facebook Thursday morning to announce that his company would be helping in the global fight against Ebola by providing internet connectivity in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, in order to help medical and aid workers, and also posting information from UNICEF. He then urged everyone to donate money if they could, saying Facebook had created a program that would allow individuals to do so directly, at which point a user from Spain by the name of Pepe Pepe Pepe decided to attack Zuckerberg - but without doing his research first.

And that is how one shuts down an Internet troll. Public knowledge: Zuckerberg had publicly announced he and his wife Priscilla (above) were donating the money back on October 14 .

"Two young men died in Ireland over the weekend, both suspected victims of the 'NekNominate' drinking craze.

'We do not tolerate content which is directly harmful, for example bullying, but controversial or offensive behavior is not necessarily against our rules. 'We encourage people to report things to us which they feel breaks our rules so we can review and take action on a case by case basis.

"Mesut Ozil has been a maligned figure at times in his Arsenal career but the attacking midfielder's dominant display in the 5-0 victory over Aston Villa was one of his best yet on these shores. The 26-year-old was almost flawless at The Emirates; his intricate passing combined perfectly with Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey in midfield while his movement in the final third was clever,  causing confusion in a Villa defence that was concerned enough with the speed of Theo Walcott. It took only eight minutes for Ozil to show he was on form. Mesut Ozil (right) was in fine form for Arsenal as they beat Aston Villa 5-0 on Sunday . Ozil (right) was in brilliant form for Arsenal and assisted their opener in superb style . Ozil (left) constantly caused an array of problems for Villa, who are a side he enjoys playing against . Ozil's heat map in the attacking third of the pitch was impressive, particularly down the left of the pitch . As his German counterpart Per Metersacker hooked the ball clear from the penalty area and into the direction of Ozil, who was just inside his own half, the midfielder took a small glance to his left as he turned towards the high ball. The look sent Olivier Giroud running, and Ozil stuck his left leg out to artistically flick the ball into the path of the onrushing striker, who closed in on Brad Guzan and lifted the ball over him for Arsenal's lead. It was a sublime touch to send the ball gliding through the Villa back line and an ominous sign for Paul Lambert that with one swish of Ozil's left boot, his side's defence was unlocked. After half an hour, Ozil capped a fine passing move with Santi Cazorla by guiding the ball beyond Guzan, but his strike was ruled out for offside. It was a tight decision but the World Cup winner, who hit the opening goal when Arsenal beat Villa 3-0 in September, was not to be nullified for the duration of the encounter. He doubled Arsenal's lead on 56, Giroud this time the provider by playing a neat ball into the run of the attacking midfielder for him to tuck the ball beyond Guzan and into the far corner. It was the goal his performance had merited, but neither he nor Arsenal were done. Seven minutes later, Walcott finished brilliantly from the edge of the penalty area to signal his own return to form and fitness after injury, before a Cazorla penalty squirmed away from Guzan and Hector Bellerin curled in from range in the final minute.

Today, Ozil played with the authority of a World Cup winner and the style of a man who cost £42.5million. Arsenal are outside of the top four and have plenty of work to do to secure a Champions League place, so the return of Ozil is timely. He has made no secret of the fact he has hit the gym in order to be able to cope with the physical demands of the Premier League and after recovering from a knee injury  against Chelsea sustained in October that ruled him out until last month, today's performance could signal an upturn in his fortunes  at Arsenal.","Mesut Ozil brilliantly assisted Olivier Giroud's opening goal for Arsenal .

"It was great while it lasted for David Moyes at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday afternoon, unfortunately it only lasted for two minutes. The Real Sociedad manager saw his team take the lead after just 40 seconds only for Real Madrid to equalise with their next attack and run out 4-1 winners. ‘We gave ourselves a platform but there was no time to build it on. I don’t think we touched the ball between scoring and their equaliser,’ said Moyes, who added: ‘At times we couldn’t lay a glove on them. I’ve seen the best team in the world today. They are world [club] champions and they played that way today especially in the first half.’ It was Moyes’ first ever match in the famous stadium. He spoke pre-match about having dreamed of coming here with Everton or Manchester United. The start was the stuff of dreams as his team scored with their first attack.

James Rodriguez equalises for Real Madrid with his head in the third minute of the La Liga match against Real Sociedad . James is mobbed by his team-mates after Real Madrid come up with an instant reply against David Moyes's side at the Bernabeu . Real Madrid: Casillas, Carvajal, Varane, Ramos, Marcelo, Irrallamendi, Kroos (Khedira 81), James (Jese 74), Isco, Bale, Benzema (Hernandez 81) Subs not used: Navas, Coentrao, Arberloa, Nacho .

Scorer(s): Aritz 1, . Booked: Yuri 88 . Referee: Alfonso Alvarez Izquierdo . Yuri took a corner from the Real Sociedad left and 21-year-old right back Aritz Elustondo headed it past Iker Casillas. This was Barcelona all over again for Moyes. His team scored against the Catalans with their first attack when they played them at the start of the year. They held on for all three points on a famous night at Anoeta – here the glory didn’t last as long. Marcelo was played in down the left and when he crossed, the unmarked James Rodriguez was left clear to head in the equalizer. Real Sociedad were not completely knocked out of their stride however and two former Real Madrid players linked up to so nearly give them their second goal. It was Esteban Granero who shot from the edge of the area and Sergio Canales stretched to turn it in but couldn’t quite send it past Casillas. The Spain keeper saved a shot from Ruben Pardo and Moyes still had some reasons to remain optimistic but things took a turn for the worse when Carlos Vela went down holding his knee. He hobbled off, then hobbled back on, and was finally taken off and replaced by Imanol Agirretxe. Real Sociedad were severely weakened and Real Madrid began to find their passes going forward as Geronimo Rulli kept his team in the game. He saved brilliantly from Benzema and then from Rodriguez as Real Madrid stepped up the pressure. Gareth Bale, who was once again booed by sections of the Bernabeu crowd, should have put Real Madrid ahead but dragged his shot wide and the Welshman then headed a Kroos corner just beyond Rulli’s far post. Madrid were getting closer to scoring a second despite Rulli’s best efforts and when the young Argentine keeper blocked Benzema's shot it dropped to Ramos who scored. With the sleet falling, Moyes now cut a slightly more forlorn figure in the technical area and he was also starting to despair at his team’s defending with Bale again guilty of poor finishing after Benzema had been allowed to break down the left. As the sleet turned to snow the only consolation was that the visitors had made it to half time with only a goal between the two sides.

Moyes prowls the touchline with a grimace on his face in the wet conditions at the Bernabeu . The early indications from the second half were that things were not going to stay that way for very long. The first warning came when Rodriguez, Bale and Isco combined brilliantly only for the latter to blaze over. The next chance fell to Benzema and was greedily accepted. He played a one-two with Bale down the left and the man who some supporters have described as selfish in recent weeks played a selfless and perfectly measured pass to the feet of the Frenchman who converted the chance before embracing the assist provider. With Cristiano Ronaldo watching from his private box with son Ronaldo junior Bale went into generosity overdrive gifting Benzema with another chance with a clever flick. Had the Frenchman not been obstructed in the area he would surely have doubled his tally. Benzema was then inches from an Isco cross – it could have been a hat-trick inside barely a minute. The Frenchman has, like Bale suffered at the hands of the Bernabeu, but they were on their feet singing his name 15 minutes from time with the goal of the game curling a shot past Rulli from just inside the area. All that was missing for the home side was one of Bale’s customary goals in the absence of Ronaldo. Real Madrid’s top scorer has missed 11 games since Bale has been at the club and Bale has scored 11 goals in those matches. When he raced clear with 10 minutes left after another defensive lapse from Real Sociedad it looked as if he would score goal number five for Real Madrid but Rulli came out to block his shot. The visiting keeper had actually put a favourable gloss on the result for Moyes. How different things had looked after just 40 seconds.","Real Sociedad took a surprise lead in the first minute as Aritz Elustondo headed home from a corner .

"Sherron O'Hagan, mother of a thug who killed an autistic man, dismissed his crime as 'no big deal' last night . The mother of a thug who killed an autistic man  dismissed his crime as ‘no big deal’ last night. In a display of callous indifference, Sherron O’Hagan said she did not know ‘what all the fuss was about’. Her son Lewis Gill killed Andrew Young with a single punch in an unprovoked attack captured on CCTV. He was given just four years but a public outcry may lead to a longer sentence. The Attorney General says he will examine whether the jail term was too short. Dominic Grieve’s office was deluged with more than 110 complaints within hours of the case becoming public. Mr Young’s mother Pamela has dismissed the sentence as an ‘absolute joke’ – Gill could even be free within two years. But Mrs O’Hagan, speaking from her home in Sutton, South London, yesterday insisted her son was a ‘good kid’. The 41-year-old mother of three told the Mail: ‘It was just an accident. It’s not a big deal. This will all be forgotten tomorrow. He’s my son, what do you want me to say? He didn’t mean to kill him and that’s that.’ Mrs O’Hagan, who was not married to Gill’s father Richard McKenzie, added: ‘This story will be the lining of chips tomorrow. I just don’t understand what all the fuss is about.’ Gill, a convicted robber, punched 40-year-old Mr Young to the ground on a busy Bournemouth street on November 6 last year. Shocking CCTV footage shows him calmly walking forward to deliver the deadly punch after Mr Young reprimanded his friend for cycling on the pavement. Mr Young, who had Asperger’s and the social skills of a 14-year-old, fell back and cracked his head on the pavement. He died the next day with his 71-year-old mother at his bedside. Gill, 20, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to four-and-a-half years by Judge Keith Cutler at Salisbury Crown Court. With half his sentence served on licence, and allowing for time already served, he could be out in just two years. The sentence was condemned by Victims’ Commissioner Baroness Newlove, whose husband Garry was killed by a gang vandalising his car. ‘I’m appalled by this disgraceful act of violence – my thoughts go out to the victim’s family and friends at this time,’ she said. Mr Young (left), who suffered from Asperger's . Syndrome, was said to be able to speak several languages but had the . social skills of a 14-year-old due to his condition. Gill (right) pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter and was jailed for . four-and-a-half years . ‘It’s entirely right that the sentence will be reviewed for this shocking crime. ‘I know how traumatic it is to go through the courts as a victim – when you are already so hurt and vulnerable. That’s why I urge everyone involved in this case to put victims first in the pursuit of justice.’ The Young family’s MP, Tobias Ellwood, welcomed Mr Grieve’s review as well. ‘It would be wrong for me to make a judgment about how long the sentence ought to be, it is not the role of an MP to do that,’ he said. ‘But the message needs to go out that this kind of behaviour should not be tolerated. I would be the first to advocate people standing up and speaking out when they see wrongdoing in their community and that is one of the reasons that a sentence like this is totally out of line.’ Mr Grieve has until March 21 to decide whether he thinks the sentence was too soft. If – as seems likely – he does, the case will go to the Court of Appeal where three senior judges could lengthen it. This is the shocking moment Andrew Young was punched by Lewis Gill - Mr Young died of head injuries a day later in hospital . Mr Young was attacked by Gill after the 40-year-old became involved in an argument with his friend . Gill, 20, can be seen to walk away after looking back to see his victim lying motionless on the ground . The Daily Mail website was also deluged with criticism of the sentencing judge, Keith Cutler, who decided Gill did not intend to cause ‘grievous harm’. One wrote that it was a ‘sad day for justice’ and another demanded that ‘criminal friendly judges’ should be held accountable to the public and another . One reader commented: ‘The man is clearly dangerous and violent. Even if he didn’t intend to cause death he punched someone who was clearly no threat to him and who made no threatening gestures of violence back. ‘Isn’t it about time the people were heard? These lenient sentences are harmful to the decent members of society.’ A statement issued on behalf of the Young family said: ‘When we first heard that Gill was given a four year sentence we thought it was too short and expected him to get more than that. It’s ridiculous. He (Gill) didn’t mean to kill him so a life sentence would have been extreme but he deserves more than what he was given. ‘Looking at his criminal record he is obviously a trouble maker and we were hoping he would get about seven or eight years. ‘A sentence so short might mean that he could do something else dangerous in the future.’ Keith Cutler, 63, refused to discuss the case yesterday at Winchester Crown Court . The judge who sent Lewis Gill to prison for just four years did not respond to criticism of what has been called an ‘extremely lenient’ sentence. Keith Cutler, 63, refused to discuss the case yesterday at Winchester Crown Court where he spent the day hearing a trial into an alleged conspiracy to commit blackmail. The Mail was told by a court usher: ‘He has refused to talk about the case.’ The judge has however previously spoken about his approach to sentencing. He has said in an interview: ‘Every offence has its different features, every mitigation has its own strengths and all those elements are brought into sentencing.’ He added: ‘Some cases get to you. When I come out of court, I say “That’s it. I’ve made my decision.  If I am wrong the Court of Appeal will deal with it”.’ The father of two, who is a lay canon at Salisbury Cathedral, has also defended his sometimes controversial approach to the legal process. This was most notable in his handling of the inquest into the shooting of Mark Duggan, where he held a 20-second silence to commemorate the gangster’s death. The judge admits that he enjoys having the power to show leniency but he reacted angrily to ministerial criticism of ‘soft’ sentencing back in 2006 when he was secretary of the Council of Circuit Judges. In October 2004, he handed teenager Louis Moroncini an 18-month supervision order for striking Beverley Brennan round the head with a 4ft wooden pole during a robbery. Judge Cutler told the defendant: ‘You know, and I know, that you richly deserve custody and you would have got three years. But you must know that if you fail me and go wrong on this order, you will be back before the courts.’ After the hearing, nursery nurse Mrs Brennan said: ‘When the judge was passing the sentence, I had to leave the courtroom because I started having a panic attack. ‘I know he’s got a curfew, but I’ll still have that worry that he could go out.’ In September 2004, Abdel Atif Gholam, 29, an Afghan refugee who had no licence or insurance when he veered on to the wrong side of the road and killed a motorcyclist, was jailed by Judge Cutler for just two years. The judge lives in a sprawling six-bedroom detached house in the heart of the English countryside. Situated off a quiet lane, the £1million property offers picturesque views and has a well-tended garden packed with tall trees and ancient woodland.","Andrew Young, 40, died in hospital after he was punched by Lewis Gill .

Theo Walcott – Looked a little rusty on his first Premier League start in over year – but still scored his second consecutive goal. 7 . Santi Cazorla – At the hub of everything that was good about Arsenal's display. Incredibly creative in possession. 9 . The impressive Santi Cazorla celebrates his goal in the 5-0 thrashing of Paul Lambert's Villa . Mesut Ozil – A goal last week, another one and an outrageous flicked assist this. Are we finally seeing the real Ozil? 8.5 . Olivier Giroud – Excellent finish to give Arsenal the lead and lead the line very well for the home side. 7 . Subs: Rosicky (for Walcott) 6.5; Akpom (for Giroud) 7; Flamini (for Ramsey) 6.5. Arsene Wenger – His side are in the groove now, about time too. Were unstoppable today. 7.5 .

"In the three months since Celtic and Rangers were first paired in the Scottish League Cup semi finals, the increasingly frenzied debate in the divided city of Glasgow has been about whether the ‘Old Firm’ still exists. And as Celtic brushed aside their old foes easily 2-0 at Hampden Park this afternoon - in the first meeting of the teams since April 2012 - the green and white hordes were not slow in informing their rivals in blue that their club ‘died’ when liquidation was visited upon Ibrox three years ago. Yet while they may have been at odds over the ‘Old Firm’ issue, by full time in this embarrassingly one-sided encounter, both sets of rival supporters would surely have been united in the view that this Rangers team is indisputably infirm.

Booked: Hutton . Referee: Craig Thomson . Attendance: 50,925 . Man of the Match: Scott Brown . A pale shadow of great Ibrox teams of the past, despite the second biggest budget in the land, Kenny McDowall’s pedestrian and deeply unimpressive side failed to register a shot of any description until a high and wide effort by Lee Wallace on 71 minutes. Celtic keeper Craig Gordon had not a single save to make. Celtic, frankly, were streets ahead of Rangers but settled for first half goals from Leigh Griffiths and Kris Commons as Ronny Deila’s men booked their place against Dundee United in next month’s final. After going ahead, Deila’s men largely played within themselves, to the annoyance of Celtic fans, who sensed an opportunity to outstrip their biggest-ever win in the fixture: ‘Hampden in the Sun’, Celtic 7 Rangers 1 in the League Cup Final on October 19, 1957. It was no surprise that this was such a mismatch, though. Celtic lead the Scottish Premiership while Rangers trail Hearts by 16 points in the Championship. Off the park chaos continues to dog Rangers, who went into yesterday’s match with caretaker manager Kenny McDowall still in the dugout despite handing in his notice last month – following in the footsteps of Ally McCoist who did likewise in November. Indeed, such is the weakened state of Rangers that cheers rang out from the Celtic dressing room when the semi final draw was made. Everything added up to a comfortable win in Ronny Deila’s first Old Firm match and that’s exactly what unfolded here at the National Stadium. After a cagey start, Griffiths justified his place in the starting line-up over John Guidetti – the on-loan Manchester City forward who publicly stated he fancied scoring a hat-trick against Rangers. Deila had waxed lyrical last week about Griffiths’ ‘world class’ left foot but he used his head here. Stefan Johansen floated over a cross from the right, Rangers defender Darren McGregor got caught under the ball and Griffiths stooped to silence the Rangers end. Commons' stunning strike secured Celtic's place in the Scottish League Cup final, where they will face Dundee United on March 15 . Commons kisses the Celtic badge as he celebrates in front of a raucous Bhoys support at Hampden Park on Sunday afternoon . A smoke bomb was let off by a Celtic supporter during the match as they celebrated their team's performance against Rangers . Police Scotland visited both squads last week ahead of this powderkeg tie to urge players to be on their best behaviour but Griffiths ignored them, cupping his ears at the Rangers fans and picking up a booking. Chants by Celtic fans of: “You’re not Rangers anymore” were immediately replaced by “Can you hear the Rangers sing?” Rangers had not played a full 90 minutes since January 10 when they won 1-0 at Alloa Athletic, and they looked rusty and devoid of any attacking ideas. And on the rare occasion they did make it up the park, winger Fraser Aird wastefully and woefully overhit a corner kick.

Celtic's Griffiths (left) celebrates alongside club captain Scott Brown after scoring to put the Bhoys 1-0 up against rivals Rangers . At the other end, Anthony Stokes saw a fierce drive dip narrowly over the crossbar before Commons made it 2-0. Tenacious play on the edge of the Rangers box by captain Scott Brown ended with Commons lashing a fierce drive high beyond Simonsen and into the back of the net. Rangers had referee Craig Thompson to thank when he bizarrely called back play for a foul on Brown by Ian Black when Griffiths was haring through on goal. And it took a good close-range save from Simonson to stop Johansen making it 3-0 by the break. The second half started with the same Celtic domination, with Griffiths firing a long-range freekick wide. But as the clock ran down, Deila’s men looked increasingly content to sit on their 2-0 lead against toothless opponents. The last whistle brought confirmation of Celtic’s place in the final as they aim for their first League Cup success since 2009. But Dundee United – who knocked out holders Aberdeen 2-1 in Saturday’s semi final – will provide a far stiffer test than Rangers offered here .

"Sometimes there are those days when everything just seems to drop into place. Those who need a goal are confident and clinical, those paid to keep them out are focused and alert; and Aston Villa are in town. Theo Walcott invited ninth-month-old son Finley along to his first game and was able to mark the occasion with his first goal in the Barclays Premier League for more than a year. 'In the second half, I can't think of a more one-sided game,' said Walcott, swept up in the euphoria of a fifth successive win, and the joy of being fit. Olivier Giroud chips the ball over the on-rushing Brad Guzan to score the opening goal of the game for Arsenal . Mesut Ozil fires in the Gunners' second goal after a well-timed through ball from Giroud . Theo Walcott bends in Arsenal's third goal of the afternoon after being set up by Santi Cazorla .

CLICK HERE to see Sportsmail's Match Zone feature for goals, stats, heat maps and more. Mesut Ozil also scored his first in the Premier League since a long injury absence. It was his first since he last played Villa, and Ozil weighed in on the baby theme with a thumb-sucking celebration dedicated to his niece. Teenager Hector Bellerin found the net, too, with his first for the club, while Olivier Giroud grabbed the opener and Santi Cazorla struck from the penalty spot, a goal which his fabulous performance deserved. There might have been more. Twice Arsenal rattled the goal frame and Ozil saw one ruled out for offside, all of which must have been very painful for Villa to witness. Paul Lambert's team have not scored in more than 10 hours, and the fact they dominated possession and missed very good chances at key moments is of little consolation. 'We scored goals and we didn't concede,' said Wenger. 'Our offensive game was good even though we had weaker periods when Aston Villa were in possession. We always looked dangerous when we got through their lines. And we were defensively sound. Overall, it was a positive day for us. 'I feel a bit for Villa. They were caught in last 20 minutes because they were tired. The second goal was a blow for them. But overall they did fight.' Arsenal have won three on the bounce in the Premier League for the first time this season, building on the victory at Manchester City. Walcott, Ozil, Aaron Ramsey and Laurent Koscielny are back after injuries, but Wenger's decisions to bring in goalkeeper David Ospina and Francis Coquelin, who has added bite in midfield, have provided stability in the team, together with what seems a tactical tweak to concede a little more possession and operate on the break. The French striker's team-mates rush over to congratulate him after his delicate finish early in the first half . Ozil put in arguably his best performance of the season as Arsenal beat Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon . Walcott celebrates scoring his first Premier League goal of the season against Aston Villa in London . Cazorla is congratulated by Chuba Akpom, who won the penalty from which the Spaniard scored . Bellerin, set up by compatriot Cazorla, celebrates scoring the final goal of the afternoon . There was no Alexis Sanchez, who was resting a tight hamstring, but, with such an array of creative talent, Arsenal will always score goals. More importantly, these three wins have been achieved without conceding once. 'We have found better consistency,' said Wenger. 'That will be important until the end. Let's show we can win more. Confidence is higher but defensive stability vital. When you don't have that you suffer. 'It's too early to say we are in the title race. We are 11 points behind. They need to lose four and we need to win four. Let's try to be consistent and see what happens.' When Ozil's ambitious heel-flick cleared Jores Okore and fell perfectly for Giroud, there was a hint it might be one of those days. Once he cleared it from under his feet, Giroud, clipped a neat finish over the dive of Brad Guzan. Cazorla thumped a low curler into a post, Ozil was denied by a flag and Guzan saved from Ramsey. Villa steadied but were cautious. Even on the turnover of possession, they appeared reluctant to commit anyone in support of the ball-carrier, often leaving it to the front three, who were overwhelmed. Even so, three minutes before half-time, the visitors should have been level and would have been were it not for a fabulous save from Ospina. Villa's players look dejected after a torrid afternoon in north London that saw them concede five goals . Giroud celebrates after scoring his eighth goal of the season for the Gunners after just eight minutes of the first half . Andreas Weimann beat Bellerin in the air to meet a cross at close range but Ospina sprang to his left to keep it out. He made another fine save in stoppage time to deny Ashley Westwood, but Weimann’s header was the big chance. Score and it might change the rhythm of the game, panic Arsenal, but it was saved and within seconds Kieran Richardson was lunging into a last-ditch tackle to avert another dangerous breakaway from Walcott. Christian Benteke missed the target as Villa came out for the second half with more adventure, which only made it easier for Arsenal to rip them apart on the counter-attack. Since his players were wasteful in possession, it is easy to understand why Lambert operates with caution. Giroud supplied Ozil for the second, who took it on at pace and applied a precision finish, and Walcott made it three, cutting in from the left, trading passes with Cazorla and swerving his shot inside the post. Giroud headed against the bar before he was replaced by Chuba Akpom, who soon won a penalty, tumbling over Guzan after beating the keeper to a though ball. Guzan read Cazorla’s plan to smash it down the centre and stood firm but was only able to deflect the powerful strike into the net with his left-hand. Bellerin slid in the fifth, a beautifully accurate side-footed finish from the edge of the penalty box. It was one of those days. Aston Villa: therapy for the goalless.

"There was a moment in the first half when Manchester City’s supporters rose to their feet to sing for the champions of English football. Jose Mourinho turned to his assistants and asked in a dismissive tone whether they could hear them. Yes they could, Jose, loud and clear. Chelsea’s increasingly irritable manager makes no bones about the fact he wants to get his hands on the Barclays Premier League again after City powered on to win it last season. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho was a real nuisance on the touchline on Saturday night . These are troubled times for Mourinho and he is fighting wars again after Diego Costa was banned by the FA for three games following that stamp on Emre Can last week. Before kick-off there was a cursory handshake with Frank Lampard, a substitute for City here and a player Mourinho once described as the world’s best midfielder in a previous era. To think there were times when Mourinho tried to take him to Inter Milan and even Real Madrid and their relationship has come to this. Perhaps there are no friendships in football any more. Mourinho gestures to referee Mark Clattenburg during the crunch Premier League encounter . He has fallen out with the broadcasters too, refusing to grant the 19 overseas TV channels who had made their way to Stamford Bridge an interview before the game. Come on Jose, you're way better than that. The self-imposed gagging order did not last long, particularly when City’s supporters repeatedly told Chelsea’s manager to sit in the technical area. Each time he acknowledged them, turning to them in the Shed and giving then a little wave with his left hand. Mourinho offered just a cursory handshake to Frank Lampard on his return to Chelsea . Mourinho could not disguise his feelings towards his former player during the 1-1 draw . They baited Chelsea’s manager throughout, antagonising him with a series of put-downs and songs that are guaranteed to wind him up at the best of times. He asks for it out there, jabbing a finger in the face of fourth official Jonathan Moss when he demanded more protection for Eden Hazard. On this occasion he had a point. Mourinho is becoming a nuisance down there, behaving erratically as his team chase down honours in the Barclays Premier League, Champions League and Capital One Cup. Mourinho makes his point to fourth official Jonathan Moss at Stamford Bridge . You would think that Mourinho, of all people, would be able to handle the unexpected events, such as Costa’s retrospective punishment, better than any other coach on earth. He has, as Chelsea supporters sang, ‘won more than you’ after David Silva diverted Sergio Aguero's strike beyond Thibaut Courtois for City’s equaliser. There is also the history with Manuel Pellegrini, with the pair sharing a mutual loathing for each other after they clashed during Mourinho’s spell as Real Madrid coach. Mourinho also exchanged words with Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini . Last season, when Fernando Torres scored Chelsea’s last minute winner beyond Joe Hart, the coach jumped over bodies to find his son Jose Junior in the crowd to celebrate with him. This time round he was bristling again, calling it on with the opposition, the referee Mark Clattenburg and occasionally City’s bench during this hard-fought game. After this he will have to wait a little longer before he is champion again.","Jose Mourinho desperate to get his hands on the Premier League again .

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has argued that his side's performance in their 1-1 draw at Chelsea on Saturday proved there is still plenty of life left in the title race. City, bidding to be the first team since Manchester United in 2009 to retain the Premier League crown, trail Chelsea by five points after sharing the spoils at Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea striker Loic Remy celebrates putting his side 1-0 up against Manchester City at Stamford Bridge . In contrast, Chelsea failed to produce a single shot after Loic Remy's goal after 41 minutes, which was cancelled out four minutes later by David Silva. Pellegrini said: 'We tried to win the game from the first minute to the end so while I am not happy with getting only one point, I am proud of the performance. 'Of course it was important to close the gap, but we still have 45 more points to play for. Although it was a very important game, it was not the final.'

"Click here to read Pete Jenson's match report from the Bernabeu . Gareth Bale was in trouble again for not passing to a team-mate and then booed by a small section of the Bernabeu crowd after the Real Madrid star missed a string of chances on Saturday night . Other supporters in the stadium sang his name in support and both his manger Carlo Ancelotti, club director Emilio Butragueno and Real Sociedad manager David Moyes leapt to the player’s defence after the game. Bale provided a superb assist for Karim Benzema in Real Madrid’s 4-1 win over Real Sociedad, a week after winning and scoring a last minute penalty to clinch a 2-1 victory at Cordoba. But there was still a smattering of jeers inside the stadium on Saturday after he missed a one-on-one with Real Sociedad goalkeeper Geronimo Ruilli and then took a chance off the toe of James Rodriguez before putting the opportunity wide.

"Just when England thought it was safe to dip their toes back in the choppy Australian waters, up popped Mitchell Johnson to swamp hopes of registering any sort of victory against the old enemy before the World Cup.

Moeen Ali was another victim of Johnson (right), who celebrates with his arms spread wide at the WACA . Glenn Maxwell (centre) was impressive with bat and ball as Australia beat England in the Tri-Series final . It gave Australia the Tri-series title at the WACA and a huge psychological advantage ahead of their big date in Melbourne on Valentine’s Day when they open this year’s World Cup. It should be pointed out that Johnson’s devastating burst of three wickets in 10 balls on Sunday — to virtually end England’s hopes of chasing 278 for eight — all came against batsmen who did not play in the Ashes. 1. England are getting better. Yes, don’t laugh, they really are. They don’t need to be as good as World Cup hot-favourites Australia to exceed expectations here and don’t need to peak for at least a month yet. 2. They know their best side, with Ian Bell and Steven Finn cementing their places. It would be a surprise if James Tredwell, Gary Ballance, Alex Hales and Chris Jordan are anything other than subs — but Ravi Bopara could do with a score soon. 3. Moeen Ali can now be considered a front-line spinner in one-day as well as Test cricket. He may not have fully fired as opener but he can be relied on for 10 economical overs. 4. The captain needs runs. Where have we heard that before? Eoin Morgan’s two golden ducks against Australia are worrying. If England are going to fire in the World Cup he must be at his best. 5. The defending champions won’t win it. India, who have been here for nearly three winless months, have been woeful and uninterested in this tournament. He was meant to be rusty, easing his way back after a month’s absence. In fact, he was simply too quick and too good for James Taylor, Moeen Ali and, first ball, captain Eoin Morgan, in a first spell of four highly significant overs. It must be said the first of those victims looked unlucky, with TV umpire John Ward seemingly failing to spot that Johnson had marginally overstepped, even though the on-field officials had asked him to check for a no-ball. Australia's players surround Johnson as Morgan (right) walks back to the clubhouse after being bowled . Mitchell Marsh holds his bat aloft in celebration after scoring a half-century for Australia, against England . Ian Bell walks from the crease back towards the pavilion after being dismissed for just eight runs . Once Moeen failed to get out of the way of a brutal snorter and Morgan inexplicably left his first delivery, normal service from the worst tour in England’s history had soberingly resumed. ‘I’m finding it hard to put my finger on why we batted like that,’ said Morgan. ‘At no time were we put under pressure. We made bad decisions which is disappointing. If we play near our capability we will beat them, I’ve no doubt.’ But, surely the Johnson factor was crucial? Not so, says Morgan. ‘He wasn’t at the front of our thoughts. We talked about the opposition but I don’t think we were threatened. I don’t think he swung it. It could have been anybody bowling. We just had a really bad day.’ If England are really not concerned about Johnson they should be, according to Glenn Maxwell, who, if anything, surpassed the fast bowler in scoring 95 and taking four wickets. ‘They should be worried about him,’ said Maxwell. ‘He tore through them. They can be not worried if they like but if they’re getting skittled by him they probably should be.’ Ravi Bopara (left) plays a shot during England's Tri-Series final against Australia at the WACA in Perth . Jos Buttler watches his ball race away towards the boundary on his way to 17 runs for England . Australian batsman Steve Smith shouts after playing a shot in the Tri-Series final on February 1 . This 112-run defeat should not be seen as fatal for England’s World Cup hopes because the structure of one-day cricket’s premier tournament is heavily weighted towards Test teams. But the manner of it was poor. They reduced Australia to 60 for four but hopes were initially dashed by a stand of 141 between Maxwell and Mitch Marsh and then another blast from the past from James Faulkner. Faulkner later walked off with a side injury that could rule him out of the World Cup, after smashing 50 from 24 balls. Even so, Australia barely reached par. England regained some hope after they ran out Marsh who, with Glenn Maxwell, put on an impressive show . Stuart Broad (centre) celebrates with Joe Root (left) and Bell (right) after dismissing George Bailey . Maxwell (right) plays a shot past Buttler on the way to 95 runs - Australia's top scoring batsman . Stuart Broad took a big step towards returning to his best with three wickets and Moeen was once again excellent — but this was a nightmare day for Chris Woakes, who went wicketless and conceded a thumping 89 runs to record the fourth-worst figures in England one-day international history. When Woakes was dismissed first ball by the spin of Maxwell his progress had been considerably dented. England’s hopes of registering what would have been a big victory did not look great when the form man Ian Bell edged Josh Hazlewood to Brad Haddin. Then Johnson showed there has been no lessening of his powers in the last year, at least on the home pitch that suits him perfectly. What was less excusable for England was conceding four wickets to Maxwell, who excelled with ball as well as bat as Australia wrapped things up with 65 balls to spare. Ali (second left) celebrates with his England team-mates after taking a wicket at the WACA in Perth . Broad lifts his index finger in celebration after dismissing Bailey to leave Australia on 46-3 against England . Bailey (left) was caught and bowled, but Australia went on to beat England in the Tri-Series final . Bell and Ali take to the field to open the batting for England on a warm day in Perth, Australia on Sunday . England have a week off before warm-up games against Pakistan and West Indies ahead of their reunion with Australia at the MCG. Johnson will be waiting there even though Morgan was bullish. ‘The pressure will build on them as the home team in a World Cup playing against a dangerous side. We’ll go out with all guns blazing.’ It remains to be seen whether that will be enough against what looks like a formidable Australian one-day side.","Australia batted out their 50 overs, scoring 278 runs for eight wickets .

"The Sabbath crowd huddled by the McLaren garage for a picture of what they really wanted – Fernando Alonso pulling on to the track at Jerez. Pre-season testing is for the hardy, wearing scarfs and fortified by hot flasks. But they were warmed at 10.42am local time on Sunday when the McLaren, powered by Honda, carried the local hero out for an installation lap. Camera crews then captured the moment when Alonso returned his new machine to the garage. It's glitzy this testing lark. Fernando Alonso takes to the Jerez circuit in his McLaren for his second bow with the British team . Alonso has joined McLaren after he ended his five-year stay at Ferrari at the end of last season . McLaren expect only to be running sporadically over the next four days. Their Honda power unit is new, in the experimental phase. Teething problems would seem inevitable. Alonso's team-mate Jenson Button landed in Jerez on Saturday, but will not be driving until Monday. Ditto Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes. The German world champions unsurprisingly set the fastest time early on the first morning with Nico Rosberg at the wheel. His time was later eclipsed by Sebastian Vettel who set the fastest lap of the opening day in his Ferrari, but Rosberg managed an impressive 157 laps in his Mercedes. Alonso tests the new Honda-powered McLaren. His team-mate Button will be behind the wheel on Monday . Alonso is wheeled back into the McLaren garage under the glare of the world's media . He had earlier vowed 'maximum attack' in a new title battle with Formula One world champion team mate Lewis Hamilton on Sunday as Mercedes unveiled their 2015 car before pre-season testing started in Jerez. 'I know the feeling of winning and of fighting for a championship after last year, but I also know the feeling of not winning in the end and I don't want to repeat that,' said the German. 'It's an extra boost and it gives me so much motivation for the year ahead.' Nico Rosberg (left) poses with Lewis Hamilton in front of the brand new Mercedes GP W06 in Jerez . Rosberg, son of Finland's 1982 champion Keke, won five races last year to Hamilton's 11 and finished runner-up in a dominant season for his team and one that saw the drivers' relationship tested to the limit. Mercedes are again expected to set the pace, even if the cars have not changed dramatically since last year's debut of the new V6 turbo hybrid power units and rivals hope to have closed the gap. 'It will be massively tough to repeat what we achieved in 2014 but we all want to keep that momentum going and to dominate the sport for many years to come,' said Rosberg. Rosberg (left) takes a selfie with Hamilton as Mercedes unveil their new car at winter testing . Rosberg completed 157 laps as he bids to mount a title challenge for the second successive season . The German in action at the Jerez circuit . 'We know the opposition will be right there, so we have to keep pushing flat out to have any chance of doing that. Nothing is for certain but, whatever happens, I know it will be another great battle with Lewis. 'This year is the rematch for me and I'm massively motivated for it.' Hamilton, now a double world champion after taking his first title with McLaren in 2008, agreed that there could be no complacency. The Briton said he was also fired up for the season which starts in Australia on March 15. Double world champion Hamilton poses for the cameras ahead of winter testing . 'You hear about people who achieve a lot but then lose their focus and you wonder; at what point does it fade off? I'm grateful that the fire is still there in me,' he said. 'I think subconsciously the taste of success spurs me on. I like that feeling and I want to feel it again and again,' added the 30-year-old. Rosberg aims to be challenging Hamilton all the way for the championship this season . 'I'm glad me and Nico had the battle we did last year. I love winning races but it just feels so much better when you have to fight for it. I just want to get back out there, race hard, be the best I can be and hopefully win some more.' German driver Sebastian Vettel, who will be the best paid driver in the history of the sport, was also in action for his new team Ferrari. Sebastian Vettel gives the new Ferrari a spin at the Jerez racetrack in Spain . Vettel has arrived from Red Bull to replace Spaniard Alonso and he too took to the track for testing in Jerez. 'Obviously there is a change in colour for me so it's a new experience but I think the car looks beautiful,' said Vettel. 'There is a lot of change going on, a lot of new people in new positions including myself, and it always takes a bit of time to settle in. 'I'm confident that we are going in the right direction but I think it would be wrong to immediately expect a lot of us. 'We need to remember we are coming from a 2014 season where there was one team very dominant so it will be difficult to be right there from the beginning.' Vettel will become the sport's highest paid driver at Ferrari this season . Vettel speaks with the media at a press conference on day one of winter testing in Jerez .

ROB DRAPER: Arsenal are lining up a defensive midfielder to add to their signing of centre-half Gabriel – but they don’t expect to be able to complete any deals until the summer. The club is not anticipating further business because the identified targets, Christoph Kramer and Morgan Schneiderlin, are not available at present.

The 20-year-old midfielder played in Koeman’s Feyenoord team last season but hasn’t enjoyed the same success under new manager Fred Rutten and is keen to join Southampton. But the south-coast club will have to meet Feyenoord’s valuation with Vilhena having been a star of the Dutch Under-17 teams and considered on the countries brightest talents. Reed, the executive director at the club, will decide today whether Southampton can bid £5m, following the £3million departure of Jack Cork to Southampton. CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL STORY .

SIMON JONES: West Ham have decided not to offer Swedish trialist Marcus Nilsson a contract despite the defender impressing during an extended two week trial. Sam Allardyce anticipates Winston Red will stay until the summer so has decided that other positions are a priority. Nilsson said: 'It is disappointing not to be offered a contract but I understand the situation and would like to thank West Ham for the opportunity, training with players like Andy Carroll, Alex Song and Kevin Nolan can only be a good thing for me, and manager Sam Alladyce has been excellent.' Nilsson, who is a free agent, is resuming talks with other teams as he seeks a new club. He added: 'I think my style of football will suit the English game, I am 6ft 4in and quick, at West Ham during a speed test, I was the fastest player at the club. 'I have got several offers from teams in Scandinavia but my ambition is to play in England and get back into the Swedish national team.'

Cuadrado was in the stands at Stamford Bridge on Saturday with his agent Alessandro Lucci . SIMON JONES: Fenerbahce have shown an interest in taking Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko to Turkey. Fenerbahce president Aziz Yeldrim is willing to pay £12m for the Bosnia international but City are likely to wait until the summer before considering a sale despite the arrival of Wilfried Bony.

"Andy Murray had his chances but he was eventually outfought, and seemingly outkidded, by Novak Djokovic to lose his fourth Australian Open final. His long-time Serbian rival appeared to play with Murray’s mind by acting as if he was physically down and out at times, before miraculously reviving to ultimately carve out a 7-6 6-7 6-3 6-0 victory. The pair had run themselves to a standstill by the end of the second set when, with two-and-a-half hours already on the clock, Murray fought back to level by winning the second tiebreak.

Djokovic headed straight to his coach Boris Becker after winning the tournament on Sunday . But just when he thought he might have cracked the world No 1 he revived to come back and clinch the third set, which always looked like deciding the match. It was not unlike their meeting at the US Open quarter-final stage last year, but this match was especially notable for the way that Djokovic went through two particular spells looking like he was on the brink of collapse. Oscar nominee or genuine difficulties? It can be hard to tell with Djokovic, and the same question has dogged Murray on occasions. The first spell was early in the second set and the other most crucially, was at the start of the third, when Murray went an early break up. Both times Djokovic recovered from stumbles and strange body contortions, displaying a previously seen capacity for suddenly rallying after being in distress. And both times it seemed to play with Murray’s mind, as he appeared distracted by what was going on at the other end of the court. He will already have known that he had created chances to prevent Djokovic registering what is an eighth win out of nine over him.

Djokovic received treatment on his hand during the first set and for a while was shaking his head as though he couldn't continue . He led the first set tiebreak 4-2 before double faulting, and missed a straightforward forehand volley at 5-5 that would have put him in front. It was when he led early in the third set, however, that he looked in the best position to win. For the second time the Serb was breathing extremely heavily, while his legs buckled from under him on several occasions. When all is said and done a huge difference was their second serve. Djokovic won 62 per cent of his and Murray only 34 per cent. For all the progress he has made with Amelie Maursemo that remains an achilles heel for the very best to exploit. By the time the last set came around the 27-year-old Scot was spent, and it all ran away quickly from him. This will be a shattering blow to Murray, although anytime you play well enough to reach a final it is an achievement in itself.

Talks have been ongoing since last week with the Brazilian side, the player's representatives and United in discussions about cancelling the 26-year-old's contract. Internacional want Anderson to play in the Copa Libertadores and are understood to have offered a four year contract worth around £25,000 a week after tax with a £650,000 annual bonus. Anderson is due in Porto Alegre with his agents on Monday for medical tests before being unveiled on Tuesday. SIMON JONES: Nice are going to the French Administrative Tribunal in order to try and have Hatem Ben Arfa available to play for them this season. The Ligue 1 side signed the Frenchman from Newcastle United earlier this month. However, Fifa ruled that Ben Arfa could not play for the club this season as he has already played for two clubs Newcastle and Hull. Nice are citing the example of Manchester City midfielder Bruno Zuculini who has just cancelled his loan with Valencia to move to Cordoba. Zuculini played for Manchester City in the Community Shield also. SIMON JONES: Hull City defender Harry Maguire is in talks over a potential loan move to Wigan.

Juventus had offered a £375,000 fee to Inter to take over Osvaldo's loan until the end of the season, however, Southampton, the striker's parent club, want to control the player's future as they consider whether he can be utilised in their own deals as they look to bring in players themselves. Inter are threatening to sue Osvaldo for breach of contract after he went AWOL from training for two days following a spat with Mauro Icardi and fell out with coach Roberto Mancini. He had been training on his own. Juventus want Osvaldo to replace Sebastian Giovinco who is moving to Toronto. Osvaldo, 29, was loaned out by Southampton after a training ground fight with Jose Fonte. SIMON JONES: West Brom have rejected a bid from Al Gharafa for striker Brown Ideye. The 26-year-old joined last summer for a club record £10million from Dinamo Kiev but has failed to impress with just two goals in 16 appearances. Qatari club Al Gharafa had initially asked to take Ideye on loan but Albion will only consider a sale and want to recoup the bulk of their summer outlay. Al Gharafa are considering a revised bid but have three other options as well as Ideye and want to secure a striker before their season kicks off next weekend against Michael Laudrup's Lekhwiya.

Reports in Spanish publication Mundo Deportivo suggest Borussia Dortmund centre-back Mats Hummels is close to agreeing a summer move to Manchester United. Dortmund travel to Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday night and Hummels is expected to play. Sportsmail understands that United have held discussions with Dortmund but the club captain wants to helps his team avoid relegation first before moving to Old Trafford. JOHN EDWARDS: Mike Phelan is linking up again with his old Manchester United team-mate Steve Bruce at Hull City, as exclusively forecast by Sportsmail last week. Former United midfielder Phelan has agreed to join Hull boss Bruce as number two at The KC Stadium and could even be there for today's lunchtime kick-off against Newcastle. Either way, Bruce has confirmed he expects Phelan's appointment as successor to former assistant-manager Steve Agnew to be ratified over the weekend and that the ex-Norwich coach will begin work officially on Monday.

"Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash accused Andy Murray of collapsing in the latter stages of his Australian Open final defeat to Novak Djokovic and believes he needs to learn from his mistakes. After the first two sets were split in two hours and 32 minutes, Murray looked to be in command against an ailing Djokovic when he broke for a 2-0 lead in the third. However, from then on the 27-year-old Scot won just one of the next 13 games as a rejuvenated Djokovic raised his game to secure a fifth Australian Open and eighth grand slam title with a 7-6 (7/5) 6-7 (4/7) 6-3 6-0 win in three hours and 39 minutes. Andy Murray shouts out in frustration after losing a point during the first set tiebreak in Melbourne . Following his defeat, Murray sat down and promptly smashed two of his rackets on the ground . Murray admitted he was distracted by Djokovic's fluctuating physical condition and Cash said: 'Things just started snowballing for Murray once he lost that concentration when everything was going his way . 'He hasn't put up a great fight, he hasn't. He absolutely collapsed. Sorry but you don't put a rose tint on this. He melted down, he's been disappointing and the bottom line is, the situation got too much.' Speaking during commentary on BBC Radio Five Live, 1987 Wimbledon champion Cash added: 'He has to look at it and say ""I can't do this again. What has gone wrong, what did I do wrong?"" It's the same stuff that's happened his whole career. Pat Cash accused Murray of having a meltdown as he lost in the Australian Open final to Novak Djokovic .

He'll be sat there thinking ""what happened, what did I do, I'm a disgrace, I've let everyone down"", but he'll learn from it.' Murray has not beaten a world No 1 since defeating Djokovic in the 2013 Wimbledon final and Cash added: 'If he wants to beat these guys then he has to start learning from this. He's a seriously good player but if he wants to be a great player then he has to fix this element. 'He has to have a good hard look in the mirror and he's needed to have a good hard look in the mirror for a long time. [Former coach] Ivan Lendl said ""Listen son, pull your head together"". 'He's got to focus and look at why he had the meltdown. If he works on that part of his game then I can see him holding the Wimbledon trophy but he's got to look in the mirror. This is not the worst thing for him to be, I'd almost say embarrassed, and hopefully he'll learn from it.'","Novak Djokovic beat Andy Murray 7-6 (7-5), 6-7 (4-7), 6-3, 6-0 .

"CLICK HERE for all the goals, stats and heat maps in Sportsmail's Match Zone . Lethal, Brendan Rodgers called him. It’s been 153 days since Liverpool’s manager last described one of his players in such ruthless, glowing terms but 11 minutes of Daniel Sturridge brought the phrase back into his vocabulary. It was a fitting description. Introduced as a 68th minute substitute, Sturridge made his first sight of goal since last summer count, beautifully cushioning a ball from Philippe Coutinho with his left foot before flashing a drive with his right past Adrian, the West Ham United goalkeeper. This was the norm last year, when Liverpool were pummelling teams in pursuit of the title, but the current season had lacked a cutting edge until now. This is the kind of contest Rodgers has seen his side labour in but the introduction of leading man secured an impressive 2-0 win.

CLICK HERE for more like this . Liverpool have often flattered to deceive since Sturridge last appeared on August 31, a combination of thigh and calf problems ruining the campaigns of player and team, but if this cameo against West Ham is to be a guide, the season might yet end with a bang. ‘It was nice for him because he has been out such a long time,’ said Rodgers, who had Raheem Sterling open the scoring. ‘It is just about managing game time now, but when he gets into that area of the pitch, he is lethal. It helped us get the rewards for an outstanding performance.’ Rodgers enthusiasm was understandable. With six draws in their last eight matches at Anfield, no Steven Gerrard — rested, according to Rodgers, as a precaution due to a tight hamstring — and the lingering effects of their efforts against Chelsea in the Capital One Cup, this game had the recipe for trouble. West Ham were aggressive from the start. Alex Song was a persistent source of irritation to Liverpool’s technical players, while Andy Carroll seemed intent on bustling Rodgers’ defenders out of their comfort zone. This was Carroll’s first return to Anfield since Rodgers swiftly called time on his Liverpool career in 2012 and he seemed wound up by the occasion. His pre-match remarks — accusing Rodgers of ‘lying’ to him — lacked class and the same could be said of his performance.

He was fortunate to get away with clattering Emre Can with his forearm after four minutes but was eventually booked for a stupid tackle on the same player. Carroll injured himself in that moment and was promptly substituted. ‘When we had to deal with that pressure, we did,’ said Rodgers. ‘Physicality is a big part of Andy’s game but we were. Mamadou Sakho was outstanding. The team stood up to that very well.’ By the time Carroll hobbled off, Liverpool had taken the lead but the first goal should have come much earlier. Only referee Andre Marriner will know why he never gave a penalty after Joey O’Brien wrestled Sterling to the ground in first half injury time. If that was baffling, so too was Lazar Markovic’s miss as play continued; picking up the loose ball, the Serbian dragged his shot wide from eight yards. Rodgers’ exasperated reaction spoke volumes. Not that it mattered. Within minutes of the restart, Alberto Moreno scampered down the left and fizzed in a cross that found the twinkling feet of Philippe Coutinho. He picked out Sterling with instinctive pass and the England forward drilled his shot beyond Adrian. Rodgers repeatedly punched the air with glee. There is no margin for error in their pursuit of a top four place and breaking West Ham’s resistance was vital. Taking the lead gave Rodgers the perfect platform to reintroduce Sturridge to a raucous reception. It got even louder when he provided the moment many had hoped for. The outstanding Coutinho set him away and he confidently manoeuvring himself into position before sweeping the ball past Adrian. Sturridge wheeled away, did that dance and Anfield came to life. ‘I’m excited about the whole collective,’ Rodgers said. Should he keep his lethal weapon fit for the final four months, reaching the Champions League might not to be beyond the realms of fantasy after all.

There is no margin for error in their pursuit of a top four place and breaking West Ham’s resistance was vital. Taking the lead gave Rodgers the perfect platform then to reintroduce Sturridge and, predictably, the acclaim he received when making his grand entrance on 68 minutes was suitably loud; 11 minutes later it had got even louder. He had already had one sight of goal before the outstanding Coutinho set him away and he was not in any mood to blow his moment, confidently manoeuvring himself into a position before drilling his shot beyond Adrian.

"Frank Lampard has told Chelsea the title race remains on as he targets a fourth Premier League winners' medal and a first with Manchester City. Lampard, Chelsea's record goalscorer, scored the equaliser in September's clash with the Blues but was unable to force a winner in the return fixture as Jose Mourinho's men survived a City siege to draw 1-1 on Saturday. Frank Lampard applauds both sets of fans during the game between Chelsea and Manchester City . The 36-year-old midfielder scored a club record 211 goals in 13 years at Chelsea and won three Premier League titles, but could be a key figure in City's title defence after leaving Stamford Bridge last May. The draw meant City remain five points behind Chelsea with 15 games to go. ""You lose and it's eight points difference and the league will become a bit more clear,"" Lampard told mcfc.com. ""Now it's very much lots of points to play for and it's on. It's important to keep focused. ""The draw keeps the league bubbling. Chelsea are obviously the favourites as they're five points ahead. David Silva (left) and Sergio Aguero celebrate the Spaniard's opener against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge . ""It doesn't change anything and Chelsea will be happy with that but we can't be too upset."" Lampard joined City ahead of a move to New York City FC, having previously said he would never play for another Premier League club. He might have expected a muted reception from Blues supporters, but, bar the odd dissenting voice, he was well received from fans who held him so dear for so long. Chelsea stopper Thibaut Courtois makes a save to deny Manchester City a goal . ""I was excited but also a bit nervous to come back here,"" said Lampard, who came on as a substitute 13 minutes from time. ""But I enjoyed it. I have to give my best when I come on the pitch and I was delighted with my reception. ""City fans have been brilliant since I've been here. I appreciate that. Chelsea fans show their love for former midfielder Lampard upon his return to west London . ""They might not have known what to expect from me when I came here. Would I come here and just jolly up for five months and then go away to America? ""They can see when I play I try to give everything and then I came back here after 13 years and got a great reception at the end. ""When you play for a long time it is nice to have that rapport and I'm lucky to have two sets of fans that were very good. ""I'm pleased for that moment because I didn't get it at the end of last year. I'm very thankful for that."" But not all Chelsea fans were pleased with the former midfielders return to Stamford Bridge . City captain Vincent Kompany has no doubts his side can overcome the deficit, with 45 points to play for. Kompany said: ""That's probably the hardest away game we'll have this season. It gives us enough confidence to carry on and push for the league. ""Five points is not too much. Experience tells us that five points is nothing so for us it's time to start a good run again and to put everything behind and play at the level that we can again."" Chelsea took the lead four minutes before half-time through Loic Remy, only to see David Silva swiftly equalise. Remy was deputising for Diego Costa after the Brazil-born Spain striker was suspended for treading on Emre Can as Chelsea advanced to the Capital One Cup final at Liverpool's expense. Cesc Fabregas (left) and Diego Costa were forced to miss the draw with Manchester City . Loic Remy replaced the suspended Costa and found the back of the net for Joe Mourinho's side . Costa will miss the matches with Aston Villa and Everton, too, and Remy has been backed to fill the void created by the absence of Chelsea's top scorer. Midfielder Nemanja Matic told Chelsea TV: ""Remy did a good job. He scored a goal and did exactly what the coach wanted from him. ""He gives us more confidence now for the next game. I'm very excited for the next game, how he's going to play. Vincent Kompany leaps highest following a Chelsea corner as Oscar attempts the flick on . ""Now people will see he's a very good player and he's going to be very important for us."" The Blues, who were also without Cesc Fabregas (hamstring) and Filipe Luis (calf), could also be boosted by the imminent arrival of Juan Cuadrado from Fiorentina. The Colombia forward was at Stamford Bridge on Saturday in a transfer which is likely to be financed by the sale of Andre Schurrle to Wolfsburg, with Mohamed Salah also moving on. Meanwhile, Mourinho again opted out of media duties and could face a fine from the Premier League.

"Udom Kachintorn, the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Siriraj Hospital, announced the discovery of the antibody at a press conference in Bangkok this week . Thai scientists have announced the discovery of a new type of antibody against the Ebola virus and claimed that it is 'more effective' than those that already exist. The potential new cure is still awaiting animal and human trials. 'We are proud to have created a new antibody treatment for Ebola fever,' Udom Kachintorn, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Siriraj Hospital, said at a press conference in Bangkok this week. 'It is a new antibody structure, a new mechanism to kill the Ebola fever in the most effective manner,' said Udom. Positive results are expected when trials are conducted on animals in the laboratory and on humans, he said. According to his research, this new antibody is small enough to enter the infected cells and destroy the Ebola proteins. It is harmless to humans as it is developed from human cells and can reproduce in large quantities. The researchers indicated that it would take a year for an experimental vaccine to be developed, although this period could be shortened with the availability of more funding and better facilities. According to his research, this new antibody is small enough to enter the infected cells and destroy the Ebola proteins. Pictured: Red Cross workers carry away the body of a person suspected of dying from the Ebola virus in Liberia on October 4 . The researches from Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok (pictured) predict it would take a year for an experimental vaccine to be developed . Siam Bioscience, a joint Thai-Cuban pharmaceutical company in Thailand, has shown interest in the trial. Currently, there are several experimental drugs for Ebola, such as ZMapp which is a combination of three types of antibodies, while companies such as GlaxoSmithKline and NewLink Genetic are expected to announce a new vaccine by the end of the year. In six months, Ebola has infected 6553 people and killed 3100 in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, three of the countries worst-affected by the epidemic in western Africa. This is the worst outbreak of the disease since the Ebola virus was discovered in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, then known as Zaire.

"Children under 12 should be banned from playing football, researchers have claimed. They say the risk of brain damage from youth football is simply too great. It found that former National Football League players who participated in tackle football before the age of 12 are more likely to have memory and thinking problems as adults. The study contradicts conventional wisdom that children's more plastic brains might recover from injury better than those of adults . Scientists examined test scores of 42 former NFL players, with an average age of 52, all of whom had experienced memory and thinking problems for at least six months. Half the players had played tackle football before age 12, and half had not. Significantly, the total number of concussions was similar between the two groups. Researchers found that the players exposed to tackle football before age 12 had greater impairment in mental flexibility, memory, and intelligence—a 20 percent difference in some cases. Both groups scored below average on many of the tests. But a new study from BU School of Medicine researchers points to a possible increased risk of cognitive impairment from playing youth football. 'Sports offer huge benefits to kids, as far as work ethic, leadership, and fitness, and we think kids should participate,' says study lead author Julie Stam. 'But there's increasing evidence that children respond differently to head trauma than adults. 'Kids who are hitting their heads over and over during this important time of brain development may have consequences later in life.' The National Institutes of Health–funded study, published online in the January 28, 2015, edition of the journal Neurology, finds that former National Football League players who participated in tackle football before the age of 12 are more likely to have memory and thinking problems as adults. 'For many, the love affair begins in childhood: Pop Warner Tiny-Mites start as young as age five, and many adults retain warm memories and friendships from their youth football days,' the researcher wrote. The study contradicts conventional wisdom that children's more plastic brains might recover from injury better than those of adults, and suggests that they may actually be more vulnerable to repeated head impacts, especially if injuries occur during a critical period of growth and development. 'This is one study, with limitations,' adds study senior author Robert Stern, a MED professor of neurology, neurosurgery, and anatomy and neurobiology and director of the Alzheimer's Disease Center's Clinical Core. 'But the findings support the idea that it may not make sense to allow children—at a time when their brain is rapidly developing—to be exposed to repetitive hits to the head. 'If larger studies confirm this one, we may need to consider safety changes in youth sports.' For this latest study, scientists examined test scores of 42 former NFL players, with an average age of 52, all of whom had experienced memory and thinking problems for at least six months. Half the players had played tackle football before age 12, and half had not. Significantly, the total number of concussions was similar between the two groups. Researchers found that the players exposed to tackle football before age 12 had greater impairment in mental flexibility, memory, and intelligence—a 20 percent difference in some cases. These findings held up even after statistically removing the effects of the total number of years the participants played football. Both groups scored below average on many of the tests. Scientists examined test scores of 42 former NFL players, with an average age of 52, all of whom had experienced memory and thinking problems for at least six months. 'We were surprised by how striking the results were,' says Stamm. 'Every single test was significantly different, by a lot.' Stamm says that the researchers were especially surprised by the scores on a reading test called the WRAT-4, which has participants read words of increasing difficulty. A person's score depends on the ability to pronounce the words correctly, indicating the person's familiarity with complex vocabulary. The low scores may be significant, she says, because they suggest that repeated head trauma at a young age might limit peak intelligence. She emphasizes, however, that there may be other reasons for a low score, and that more research is needed. 'If you take just the hippocampus, that's a really important part of your brain,' he says. 'It may be that if you hit your head a lot during this important period, you might have significant memory problems later on.' Stern adds that a study by another group of researchers of the number and severity of hits in football players aged 9 to 12, using accelerometers in helmets, found that players received an average of 240 high-magnitude hits per season, sometimes with a force similar to that experienced by high school and college players. Researchers say say the risk of brain damage from youth football is simply too great. With approximately 4.8 million athletes playing youth football in the United States, the long-term consequences of brain injury represent a growing public health concern. 'Football has the highest injury rate among team sports,' writes Christopher M. Filley, a fellow with the American Academy of Neurology, in an editorial accompanying the Neurology article. 'Given that 70 percent of all football players in the United States are under the age of 14, and every child aged 9 to 12 can be exposed to 240 head impacts during a single football season, a better understanding of how these impacts may affect children's brains is urgently needed.' Filley's editorial cautions that the study has limitations: because the researchers could not precisely determine the players' lifetime number of head impacts, it may be the total number of hits—rather than the age of a player—that is the more critical measurement. 'Sports are important, and we want kids to participate in football,' says Stamm. 'But no eight-year-old should play a sport with his friends and end up with long-term problems. ' We just want kids to play sports more safely.'","Researchers had  believed young brains were more plastic and resilient .
Now say the opposite is true and there are more vulnerable .

"Louis van Gaal has warned Manchester United they still have much work to do before they secure Champions League qualification. United returned to winning ways on Saturday with a 3-1 victory over Leicester at Old Trafford. Robin van Persie put United ahead with a sublime finish and Radamel Falcao added his fourth for the club before Wes Morgan's own goal helped United avenge their embarrassing 5-3 reverse at the King Power Stadium last September. Louis van Gaal expects more improvement from his team after Manchester United beat Leicester City 3-1 . Robin van Persie (second left) celebrates his goal for United against Leicester . The win lifted Van Gaal's team to within five points of second-place Manchester City and also went some way to appeasing the fans who watched their team play out an uninspiring 0-0 draw at Cambridge last week. But Van Gaal reminded his players following the win that the season is far from over. 'No, because (only) at the end of the league matches we divide the titles and not at this moment,' the United boss said when asked if he could sense Champions League qualification was getting closer for his men. United have a winnable set of fixtures coming up against West Ham, Burnley, Swansea, Sunderland and Newcastle. But Van Gaal is aware he still has to travel to Liverpool and Chelsea in the last third of the season and he believes the fight for a top-four finish will go right down to the wire. 'It shall be a big battle to the end,' Van Gaal told MUTV. 'That is a big battle. West Ham has lost (to Liverpool on Saturday). 'One competitor shall lose.' Radamel Falcao celebrates scoring his fourth goal for the club against Leicester on Saturday . Van Gaal (right) shakes hands with Leicester's Esteban Cambiasso (left) after the game at Old Trafford . Van Persie candidly admitted on Monday that he had under-performed this season. But he looked like his old self for long periods on Saturday and his goal was out of the top drawer. Van Persie watched Daley Blind's pass float over his left shoulder before he stabbed the ball past Mark Schwarzer first time with his right boot. Replays showed the striker was lucky the goal was allowed to stand, though, as he was marginally offside. Van Gaal felt for his opposite number Nigel Pearson, and admitted such errors will only be stopped if more technology is introduced into the game. 'I think also it was offside but it always happens in games that the referee or a linesman are not in a good shape at that moment but you cannot avoid that,' Van Gaal said. 'You need modern techniques always and when you don't use them in this modern time it shall happen every game.' While United have City in their sights, it is a completely different story for Leicester, who remain rooted to the foot of the Barclays Premier League. Van Persie's (right) goal was spectacular but there were suspicions of offside . Ritchie De Laet (left) is hopeful that Leicester will still be able to avoid relegation from the Premier League . The Foxes are three points from safety but defender Ritchie De Laet is still confident his team will not be relegated. 'The United game was a bonus game, no one was expecting us to take anything from it,' said De Laet, who left United for Leicester three years ago. 'But our confidence is still high. 'I think we can get out of it. You just have to look at the last five performances. We have had three wins out of them so we know we can give teams a good game. 'We still have everyone to play around us and those are the important games.'","Manchester United sauntered to a 3-1 win over Leicester City on Saturday .

"European Union president Herman Van Rompuy has been forced to remove a poem from his personal website after Jewish activists complained the author was a well-known Nazi. The poem, The Seagull, was removed yesterday after a group dedicated to fighting anti-semitism pointed out that the author was sentenced to death for collaborating with the Nazis during the Second World War. The poet, Cyriel Verschaeve, was a priest from Flanders in Belgium’s northern half, who in his political pamphlets likened Jews to 'vermin' and 'weeds' that needed exterminating. Anger: EU President Herman Van Rompuy, pictured, said The Seagull was a favourite poem of his mother-in-law - but it was written by well-known Nazi Cyriel Verschaeve, who described Jews as weeds . He was promoted to head of the Flemish cultural council by the Nazis during the occupation of Belgium and fled to Austria when the allies liberated the country in 1944, taking part thereafter in the Flemish government in exile. He was sentenced to death by the Belgian courts when the war ended, but the sentence was never carried out as Austria did not extradite him. He died there in 1949. Hate preacher: Cyriel Verschaeve was a priest from Flanders in Belgium who in his political pamphlets likened Jews to 'vermin' and 'weeds' that needed exterminating . Mr Van Rompuy, who has been accused of being the 'human face' of Flemish extremists, said he included the poem on his website because it was a favourite of his mother-in-law. As chairman of the European Council, Van Rompuy is in frequent touch with all EU heads of state and government, including David Cameron. He is something of a poet himself and is well known for writing ‘haikus’ or short poems in traditional Japanese style. The Belgian League against anti-semitism welcomed the decision to take down the poem, which dates back to 1909. 'Whereas this poem contains no anti-semitic references and was on Mr Van Rompuy’s website for personal reasons that have no relation with the political convictions of the author, the League underlines that this is an oeuvre by the writer Cyriel Verschaeve, who, from 1940, collaborated actively with the Nazi occupiers and was sentenced to death in absentia by the Belgian courts after the Second World War,' it said in a statement. UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage has clashed publicly with Van Rompuy on several occasions. Farage was fined by the European Parliament for saying Van Rompuy had “all the charisma of a damp rag” - a reference to his permanent low profile. But behind his austere appearance the Belgian is said to be a cunning political operator who has successfully climbed the EU’s greasy pole right to the top. Clash: UKIP leader Nigel Farage was fined for saying Mr Van Rompuy had 'all the charisma of a damp rag' He was chosen to be president of the European Council by EU leaders in 2009 and is due to step down after two terms at the end of this year. Belgian’s role in the Second World War is controversial even today. Many Flemings in particular have struggled to come to terms with the region’s collaborationist past. The country’s French-speaking southern half on the other hand provided a greater number of resistance fighters.","The Seagull was by priest and Nazi collaborator Cyriel Verschaeve .

"Louis van Gaal's Manchester United were able to exact revenge on Leicester City thanks to goals from Robin van Persie, Radamel Falcao and an own goal by Wes Morgan. The away side, who claimed a surprise 5-3 win against United back in September, pulled one back through Marcin Wasilewski but his effort proved to be nothing more than a consolation goal. Sportsmail's Mike Keegan rated the players at Old Trafford. Robin van Persie scored his ninth Premier League goal of the season against Leicester . MANCHESTER UNITED . David de Gea 6 . Pipe and slippers for the Spaniard who, especially in recent seasons, will not have had many quieter afternoons. Denied Nugent with ease but will have been disappointed with Leicester's consolation. Antonio Valencia 7 . Continues to thrive at right back. Another commanding performance packed with attacking intent before being replaced by Mata. Jeffrey Schlupp is challenged by Manchester United's Antonio Valencia during the Premier League encounter . Phil Jones 6.5 . Dally almost let Nugent in. Ability to drop a needless clanger remains but otherwise assured. Marcos Rojo 7 . A reassuring presence at the back. An easy afternoon but is beginning to look a shrewd piece of business. Stood up well to Ulloa. Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo kept a close eye on fellow countryman Leonardo Ulloa . Luke Shaw 7 . Encouraging from the left back. Was given little to cope with defensively and was willing in attack. Angel di Maria 7 . Back in his favoured position behind the striker the Argentina playmaker was wasteful early on but surged forward and his parried shot set up Falcao. Not a bad outing and should have scored late on. Daley Blind 7.5 . Beautiful dinked ball over the top for Van Persie to open the scoring. Picked up the pieces and allowed others to attack with confidence. United's first team stars celebrate Wes Morgan's own goal with Daley Blind taking the majority of the praise . Wayne Rooney 7 . Reassured by the defensive qualities of Blind and willing runners to aim for. A decent 90 minutes in midfield for the captain. Adnan Januzaj 6.5 . Anonymous early but became more confident. Did well to win the corner which led to the third. Radamel Falcao 7.5 . Got his feet stuck underneath him when played in by Van Persie but was sharp to scramble home Di Maria's rebound for the second. Radamel Falcao looked delighted after adding to his United tally against the Premier League strugglers . Robin van Persie 8 . Admitted he needed more goals and his neat half-volley gave United the lead. Kick-started the move for the second and came through 68 minutes unscathed. Van Persie celebrates his 27th minute opener after netting his ninth Premier League goal of the season . Subs: Paddy McNair (on 68) 6 . Job done by the time the youngster replaced Van Persie. Juan Mata (on 77) 6 . Will have been disappointed to find himself on the bench with 13 minutes to make an impression and played more of a defensive role as the visitors pressed. James Wilson (on 80) 6 . Replaced Falcao but may now find himself behind the Colombian in the pecking order. Wasted a half chance. LEICESTER CITY . Mark Schwarzer 6 . The big Aussie had no chance with any of the goals and was regularly exposed by a shaky backline. Leicester goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer was unable to keep the likes of Falcao and Van Persie at bay . Ritchie De Laet 6 . Will have been keen to impress back at Old Trafford and put in a strong performance, surging down the left when he could. Marcin Wasilewski 6.5 . Offered little going forward until late and could have been stronger to prevent Falcao scrambling home the second but took his header well. Leicester defender Marcin Wasilewski scored a late consolation goal  by scoring past David de Gea . Wes Morgan 5 . Given a tough time by Falcao and headed into his own net to make it 3-0. Not a great afternoon for the big captain. Leicester captain Morgan looks dejected after scoring past team-mate Schwarzer in the 44th minute . Danny Simpson 5 . Played in sub Cambiasso for a rare opening but struggled to contain United's left. Not a happy homecoming for the Salford boy. Danny Drinkwater 5 . Booked for a nasty foul on Shaw. Another in the Leicester ranks who will not have enjoyed a return to the club he started his career with. Former United midfielder Danny Drinkwater was unable to stop Morgan's header from landing in the net . Andy King 6 . After a bright opening the Welshman failed to contain a rampant United midfield and spent long periods on the back foot in a damage limitation role. Jeffrey Schlupp 5 . Almost caught napping by Di Maria early on. Probed when he could but was nullified by the excellent Blind. Not strong enough. Leonardo Ulloa 5 . On his own up front and at times isolated. The big man cut a frustrated figure and was offered no service. Yanked after an hour. Leicester forward Leonardo Ulloa, pictured with Rojo, failed to impress against Louis van Gaal's side . Andrej Kramaric 5 . Struggled to make an impact, the only Leicester layer wearing gloves was at fault for the first goal, his dallying allowing Blind to set up Van Persie and tried a ridiculous scissor-kick in the second half. Subbed on 63. Jamie Vardy 5 . Sacrificed at half-time for Esteban Cambiasso. A harsh decision as most of United's threat had come from the opposite side of the pitch. Subs: Esteban Cambiasso (on 46) 6 . The game, like the Argentine's best years, had gone by the time he was introduced. Experienced midfielder Esteban Cambiasso, pictured with Rooney, replaced Jamie Vardy at the interval . Marc Albrighton (on 63) 6.5 . Sent on in the desperate hope of triggering a revival, the former Villa man should be blameless, especially after his fine cross set up Wasilewski. David Nugent (on 63) 6 . Given the thankless task of replacing Ulloa and should have done better from a Jones error but was denied by De Gea.","Robin van Persie scored Manchester United's opening goal in 3-1 win .

"Jonathan Walters made a beeline for the match ball at the final whistle. He stuffed it underneath his shirt and held it tightly as he strutted towards the tunnel. It was a tangible reminder of his 200th appearance for Stoke, the day he scored a perfect hat-trick — one with his right foot, one with his left and a header in the 90th minute. He is the first player to achieve the feat since Kevin Nolan and Romelu Lukaku in May 2013. ‘He was magnificent the whole game,’ said manager Mark Hughes, ‘He probably doesn’t get enough credit for the effort he puts in. He gives everything every game. He is going the right way about getting a new contract.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Stoke 3-1 QPR .

Walters confirms all three points will be leaving with the home side as Walters scores his third of the game . Walters (left) celebrates a superb hat-trick during the 3-1 win over relegation threatened QPR . Harry Redknapp shook his head at the final whistle. This was his side’s fourth loss in a row, as they extended their record for the most consecutive away defeats in Premier League history, which now stands at 11. For many, the emblem of transfer deadline day is the sight of Redknapp giving interviews to the rolling news channels out of his car window. The QPR boss said: ‘I couldn’t say we’re going to get anyone in before the deadline. Everyone’s trying but it’s not easy at this stage of the season. I don’t know whether Emmanuel Adebayor is a possibility but he’d do for us.’ Redknapp was encouraged by his side’s second-half performance. Eduardo Vargas nearly scored a showstopper equaliser on 57 minutes but his scissor kick effort was well saved by Asmir Begovic. ‘It looks with a 3-1 scoreline like you’ve been well beat but that isn’t the case. At 2-1 at half-time I said I thought we could win. They were hanging on for grim life.’ A glum looking Roy Keane was in the stands, a day after allegedly unleashing a barrage of verbal abuse to a taxi driver who told him to ‘smile’. Perhaps a grin was elicited from the heavily bearded Republic of Ireland assistant manager by the sight of his players Stephen Ireland and Walters combining so well. For the first, goal, Ireland’s neat back-heel pass set up his countryman for a simple finish. The two players collaborated again to double the home side’s lead. They exchanged passes twice before Ireland pulled the ball back across goal for Walters to score with a cool finish. Nico Kranjcar, who clearly enjoys a trip to the Potteries, pulled one back for QPR with his third goal in as many games at the Britannia. But Walters sealed the victory with a header after the ball bounced kindly for him in the box. Walters opens the scoring for Stoke City against Queens Park Rangers at the Britannia Stadium .

At the double: Stoke find themselves two goals ahead thanks to Walters' second goal of the game . A glum looking Roy Keane was in the stands at the Britannia, a day after allegedly unleashing a barrage of verbal abuse to a taxi driver who told him to ‘smile.’ Perhaps a grin was elicited from the heavily bearded Republic of Ireland manager by the crucial role his compatriot Stephen Ireland played in the two Stoke goals. For the first, it was his neat back heel pass that set up Walters for a relatively simple finish.

That goal enlivened the game after a dire opening 20 minutes, with routine passes going astray and the icy wind whipping in from the open edged stadium making it difficult to retain possession. Not that it was having a detrimental effect on Ireland and Walters who again collaborated superbly to double the home side’s lead. They exchanged the ball twice before midfielder Ireland, 28, unselfishly pulled the ball back across goal. QPR defender Nedum Onuoha scrambled back but could do nothing to prevent Walters netting his ninth goal of the season – six in the league - with a cool headed finish from six yards out. Niko Kranjcar hints at a possible QPR comeback as he find the net during the first half against Stoke . Nico Kranjcar, who clearly enjoys a trip to the Potteries, pulled one back for QPR with his third goal in as many games at the Britannia.

Joey Barton then smacked the underside of the crossbar with a free kick from 25 yards out. Begovic made a comfortable but crucial save of a fizzing Leroy Fer free kick from 30 yards out as the visitors pushed for a point to take back to West London in the closing minutes.

"Follow live coverage as David Moyes takes his Real Sociedad side to Santiago Bernabeu to take on the La Liga leaders Real Madrid (kick-off 3pm). Sociedad are 11th in the standings, some 26 points behind Carlo Ancelotti's men but Moyes will hope to mastermind an unexpected victory as he did against Barcelona earlier this month. Moyes will serve the second of a two-game touchline ban following his sending off against Villarreal and so will watch from the stands. Real Madrid will be without the suspended Cristiano Ronaldo, who was handed a two-match ban for an altercation in last weekend's match in Cordoba. They could hand a debut to 21-year-old Brazilian midfielder Lucas Silva, who joined this week from Cruzeiro for £9.7m.

Pete Jenson's match report from the Santiago Bernabeu is in, click above to read it. Atletico Madrid are in action against Eibar later, as they try to match title rivals Real's score and Barcelona play Villarreal tomorrow. That is all from me today, thanks for joining. Not an enjoyable day for David Moyes. His side took the lead in the first minute through Aritz Elustondo but they could only hold on for two minutes before James Rodriguez made things level. Carlo Ancelotti's side powered on from there and were denied several times by Geronimo Rulli before Sergio Ramos put Real 2-1 up. A double from Karim Benzema in the second half, including an absolutely astonishing second, pulled Madrid further out of sight and had it not been for Rulli, things could have got very humiliating for Moyes. Real Madrid 4-1 Real Sociedad . Rulli blocks Hernandez from point blank range, another great save! Not long left here at all for Sociedad to endure. No hat-trick for Benzema today as Javier Hernandez replaces him for the final moments of the game. Toni Kroos is also withdrawn and Sami Khedira takes his place. He may have conceded four this afternoon but Geronimo Rulli has kept the score down from Madrid's ruthless attack. He is one of the few players Moyes will be pleased with today. How is it not five? Gareth Bale is denied by Geronimo Rulli after racing clear of the Sociedad defence and while it is another great save from the goalkeeper, you would expect Bale to hit the back of the net with the amount of time he had. It started so well for David Moyes, but the game has proved to be as miserable as the weather in Madrid today. He has not been able to repeat his Barcelona heroics and the Scotsman will want to forget today as quickly as possible. 76 - Benzema gets his second of the match and it is the best goal of the game by far! The France striker has been superb for Carlo Ancelotti's side and he gets his second in stunning style. He plays the ball into Isco, who returns it to him on the edge of the area before lashing an astonishing strike across goal that bends up into the top corner. Rulli does not have a chance with that, incredible strike! Real Madrid 4-1 Real Sociedad Karim Benzema . James Rodríguez, scorer of Madrid's first goal, is done for the afternoon. He leaves the field to a rapturous reception from the Real supporters and Jese replaces him. Marcelo joins Illarramendi in the book for Real, after putting in a rather brutal challenge on Agirretxe. Madrid now seem to have taken their foot off the gas, but the damage has been done to Sociedad. There is around 20 minutes left. It's 3-1 Real, who have been in ferocious form from the moment they fell behind to Sociedad. Here's a picture of Karim Benzema celebrating with Gareth Bale, who provided the assist for his strike, their side's third goal of the game. Moyes uses his final change, with goalscorer Aritz Elustondo being taken off and Markel Bergara, a defensive midfielder, coming on. It looks like it might be a case of damage limitation for Sociedad. Madrid pressing forward relentlessly now and Benzema almost had a second and Real's fourth. Bale slid the ball across the penalty area from the left and it needed a touch from Inigo to direct the ball away from the attacker. Meanwhile, here is a shot of Sergio Ramos celebrating after putting Madrid 2-1 ahead. It is hard to believe that they were ever trailing this game, even if it was for only two minutes. It's a sublime goal from Madrid, who instantly undo any defensive reassurance that Moyes' decision to swap Canales for De la Bella may have brought. The France striker exchanges passes with Bale on his way into the penalty area before slotting cooly past Rulli. 3-1, and it has been coming. Real Madrid 3-1 Real Sociedad Karim Benzema . It is an interesting swap from Moyes. Canales has the potential to provide Madrid with some concern with his attacking forays but he has been hooked in favour of a defender, who Moyes will no doubt hope can offer some reassurance in their own third of the pitch. Moyes has made a second change of the match, taking off Sergio Canales and replacing him with Alberto De la Bella, a left-back. But a powerful header from James Rodriguez levelled the scores after three minutes. Sergio Ramos put the hosts ahead on 36 but Marcelo has been the key player for Madrid, carving David Moyes' side open with ease. If they stop him, they may have a chance of getting back into the game. Real Sociedad's players celebrate going ahead against Real Madrid in the first minute at the Santiago Bernabeu. Bale sent a free kick over the bar after Benzema was chopped down by Inigo Martinez. At half-time, the score is 2-1 but Pete Jenson, Sportsmail's man in Madrid, says 'Real Sociedad will do well to have kept this at 2-1.' It all started so well for Moyes, as his side went ahead in the first minute through Aritz Elustondo but James Rodriguez swiftly pegged them back before Sergio Ramos put the Champions League holders into the lead. It should be 3-1! How is it not 3-1? Bale has just found himself all alone, only Rulli to beat with Rodriguez and Benzema either side of him and he has missed the target completely! Moyes is furious, absolutely furious. Bale is equally as embarrassed. Benzema's initial chance came from another cross from Marcelo, who seems hell bent on causing the destruction of Sociedad today. His movement is clever, his passing accurate and incisive and Sociedad just can't contain him. 36 - There is only so much Rulli can keep out. He does exceptionally well to block Benzema's initial shot but the rebound falls to Sergio Ramos. The defender doesn't need a second invitation and stabs the ball home. Finally, Madrid have the lead. Real Madrid 2-1 Real Sociedad Sergio Ramos . Asier Illarramendi has the first yellow card of the game for a late challenge on Pardo after 31 minutes. James Rodriguez is now denied by Rulli, who beats away a fearsome strike from the Colombia international. Madrid come again, but Benzema's header is very high and Rulli watches the ball sail over the bar. This is a tough test of Sociedad's defensive credentials. This is an ominous sign for Sociedad and Moyes. Gareth Bale has 11 goals in 11 games for Madrid when Cristiano Ronaldo has not been in the side. In an end-to-end opening 10 minutes, Bale's involvement was minimal but he has just forced a corner after his fierce shot was deflected out of play, and Sociedad eventually scramble the ball away. Rulli to the rescue for Sociedad and it is Marcelo who is again the creator. He threads an enticing ball through Sociedad's defence and into the path of Karim Benzema, who has his chance smothered by the onrushing goalkeeper. Madrid are growing into this now. That substitution is not something Moyes would have wanted to have done so early in the game and he will hope it does not upset the organisation of his team. He has not lost in six encounters against Carlo Ancelotti and he'll be desperate to extend that run today. And it is Imanol Agirretxe who replaces Vela after 17 minutes. Not what David Moyes wants to see here. Striker Carlos Vela hobbles off and Alfred Finnbogason starts warming up. Imanol Agirretxe is another option. Real are starting to look a little bit more comfortable after a frenetic opening 10 minutes. But Rodriguez's strike has not deterred Sociedad, who could not get much closer to taking the lead again. Esteban Granero's shot from the edge of the area is weak and finds the path of Sergio Canales, who stick his foot out and diverts it narrowly wide of the post. The score remains 1-1 but if the game continues in this manner, it won't be for much longer. It was a tremendous header Rodriguez, sending a cross from Marcelo into the roof of the net and leaving goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli with no chance. What a start here! Moyes was in dreamland... but his joy lasts only two minutes as James Rodriguez swiftly levels for Madrid. Three minutes gone and already there are two goals! Real Madrid 1-1 Real Sociedad . It has not taken Sociedad any time at all to stun the Santiago Bernabeu! One of the young players that Moyes has pushed into the first team, Aritz Elustondo, gets the goal with a header from a corner! Real Sociedad 1-0 Real Madrid . Pete Jenson is at the game for Sportsmail: Two former Real Madrid players in Real Sociedad's line-up and both Esteban Granero and Sergio Canales were given warm welcomes by club staff when they arrived at the stadium just over an hour ago.

"Gabriele Angella must be getting tired of his visits to Dean Court being cut short after a dubious sending off within 32 seconds put paid to Watford's chances of overcoming Bournemouth. A first-half penalty from Yann Kermorgant and Matt Ritchie’s second-half strike moved Bournemouth three points clear at the top of the Championship having played a game more than Derby in second. One year ago in this same fixture Angella was sent off in a case of mistaken identity when his defensive partner Fitz Hall pulled Lewis Grabban’s shirt when he was through on goal. Matt Ritchie celebrates after scoring in Bournemouth's victory against Watford on Friday night . Bournemouth's Yann Kermorgant scores the opening goal of the evening from the penalty spot . Heurelho Gomes dives to his left as Kermorgant's shot flies straight down the middle of the goal . Ritchie, who was impressive throughout, scores the second goal of the evening to seal the win . Bournemouth (4-4-2): Boruc, Francis, Elphick, Cook, Daniels, Ritchie (Smith 89), Surman, Arter, Pugh, Wilson (Pitman 94), Kermorgant (O'Kane 77). Subs not used: Camp, Stanislas, Fraser, Ward.

Subs not used: Doyley, Savic, Bond, Byers. Sent off: Angella. Referee: Lee Probert . Watford got the offence overturned and manager Slavisa Jokanovic is considering appealing again this time around as their was a man covering and Bournemouth’s Callum Wilson was far from goal when he was scythed down by the defender and Lee Probert produced the red card. Jokanovic joked afterwards that he could not comment on the decision for risk of incurring a fine when he is paid little by Watford, but on a serious note added: ‘It’s simple; it’s wrong and strange. It’s not good for them and it’s not good for us. It’s not good for our supporters or their supporters. It was a joke.’ The visitors faced 89 minutes and 28 seconds – plus stoppage time – against the Championship’s top scorers who had already netted 57 times this season - and one of the leading strikers in the league in Wilson. It was he who cleverly won the 34th-minute penalty, stroked in by Kermorgant, by turning into Watford’s Craig Cathcart to draw a foul.

Watford were restricted to half chances. Ikechi Anya shot low, hard and wide across goal and Ben Watson poked an effort agonisingly wide. As the second half drifted onwards Watford increased the pressure on their opponents and the game felt like one in which Bournemouth would need at least a second to seal it. Ritchie duly obliged in the 57th minute by rattling a shot past Heurelho Gomes in Watford’s goal from a tight angle on the right to double their lead. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe admitted: ‘I’d be disappointed if I was the Watford manager. The timing of the red card makes it a bitter pill to swallow. The game had just started.

"A giant barrel jellyfish weighing up to 20kg has been spotted swimming in a Cornish estuary - but swimmers will be relieved to hear it's completely harmless. Cornwall Wildlife Trust officer Matt Slater was having a swim with his dog Mango when he had a close encounter with the creature in the Percuil estuary near St Mawes, Cornwall, catching it on film. It is one of several barrel jellies which have been spotted with increasing frequency inland as the creatures swam in warm summer waters. Scroll down for video . Rare: This metre-wide barrel jellyfish was spotted by Cornwall Wildlife Trust officer Matt Slater in the Percuil estuary near St Mawes. The creatures are common in the middle of the English channel but rarely come inland . Like a horror film: The jellyfish may look intimidating, but thankfully they are completely harmless . Like a basking shark, barrel jellies feed exclusively on plankton which is caught with sticky mucus-covered tentacles. They are also totally harmless to humans as their stings are too weak to get through human skin. Mr Slater said: 'It was an otherworldly experience. These creatures are incredibly beautiful when you get a close look at them. 'The tentacles really look like soft coral, and round the edge of the jellyfish's umbrella like bell there is a deep blue line punctuated every 20cm or so with a tiny dot, a sensory statocyst. 'Jellies are more aware of the watery world around them than you may imagine. Close encounter: Mr Slater's dog Mango came close to the jellyfish in the warm summer waters . Tranquil: The Percuil estuary where the creature was spotted. Several have been seen in the south west . They look like something from a horror film, but barrel jellyfish are the 'basking shark' of their species - enormous but harmless, feeding only on miniscule prey. Often they are spotted from boats in the deeper waters of the English Channel, the Irish Sea and off the Outer Hebrides. But it is rare for them to swim closer to the coast or inland, which is why recent sightings have made headlines. And when the seas warm up in summer and autumn they breed at a phenomenal rate, creating huge swarms. Beneath the dustbin lid-shaped bell are hundreds of tiny mouths ('pores'), each surrounded by tiny stinging tentacles to catch plankton. The stings, however, are not strong enough to harm humans. Source: Marine Conservation Society . 'They are constantly swimming up and down in the water column looking for profitable patches of plankton. 'The statocysts are their sensory cells that enable them to orientate and tell up from down.' The Marine Conservation Society said it had received reports of jellyfish being spotted across the south coast and west coast of England, as well as parts of Scotland because of the warmer weather. There have also been sightings of turtles in the south-west of England and the Wales coast. Mr Slater added: 'Lots of people have been calling Cornwall Wildlife Trust to ask us why there are so many jellies this year. 'In the spring tiny anemone like jellyfish 'polyps' living on the sea bed expand in size and then bud off thousands of tiny larvae. 'Most years these larvae will perish but in years where the conditions are good, temperatures are optimal, there is plenty of planktonic food and predators do not eat them all, large numbers of them will survive creating these huge jellyfish swarms. 'It is a boom and bust cycle. In fact according to our records the last time such large numbers of barrel jellyfish were seen in Cornwall was in 2002.'","Creatures rarely seen inland but have flourished in unusually warm waters .

"It was a farce that would lead to a goalkeeper given a red card, a team red with anger... and the Dutch FA red-faced after reversing the ref's decision.

To everyone's surprise, Costa Rican goalie Esteban Alvarado . then launched a kung fu kick at the teenage . thug, sending him crashing to the floor - and landed a few more kicks before security guards dragged the invader away. And when referee Bas Nijhuis red-carded the goalkeeper, Alkmaar coach Gertjan . Verbeek ordered his side to walk off in protest. Now, however, the red card has been rescinded by the Dutch FA (KNVB).

At the time, Nijhuis said: 'I understand that Esteban was defending himself, but he walked to him (the supporter) and kicked him multiple times. He could also have walked away.'

"Stuart Pearce has been sacked by Nottingham Forest following the dismal 1-0 loss at home to Championship strugglers Millwall, which capped a run of three wins in 23 matches. Owner Fawaz Al Hasawi met with Pearce on Sunday afternoon culminating in the club’s legendary former player leaving after seven months in charge.

Pressure has been mounting on Pearce for a considerable period and Sportsmail reported three weeks ago how Al-Hasawi had sought counsel from players over his management style, also sending associates to watch training. The dramatic victory over rivals Derby is believed to have granted Pearce more time but the alarming first-half performance in defeat to Fulham which followed brought his position under scrutiny again. Saturday’s defeat at the City Ground made his role untenable. Petrescu, the former Chelsea defender, is known to Al-Hasawi and is keen to work in England following spells in Romania, Poland and Russia. Last month, Sportsmail revealed that Pearce's position was under severe pressure. Fawaz Al-Hasawi (centre) feels Forest need a change to their philosophy to turn around their barren run .

My decision to relieve Stuart of his duties is the hardest footballing decision I have ever made. 'I came to that decision after a long conversation with Stuart about the best next step for the club. Unfortunately, recent results convinced me it was best to pursue alternative managerial options. 'I hope our supporters understand my decision.Stuart is someone I have always admired and that will never change.

"Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew has admitted his side missed Marouane Chamakh's presence in front of goal after the striker was taken off with a broken nose during the match against Everton on Saturday. The Eagles suffered their first defeat in six games and Pardew bemoaned Palace's lack of cutting edge up front. 'We never really produced a classical moment, or a great moment today,' he told reporters. 'The loss of Cham was crucial today, his guile and experience around the box would have been important.' Crystal Palace striker Marouane Chamakh was taken off after suffering a broken nose against Everton . But Pardew is hoping to welcome his striker back in time for Palace's next game against Leicester and also rued Dwight Gayle's shot being cleared off the line by Phil Jagielka. 'He (Chamakh) wasn't concussed, but it was a heavy blow to the nose. I think he'll be okay for Leicester.' 'I thought Gayle's shot was in, and the players' reaction looked like it was in. 'So whoever invented that goal line technology wanted kicking up the bum today! 'To be fair the linesman said 'it's not on the watch', so I knew straight away really.' Chamakh slides in to tackle Everton midfielder Muhamed Besic (left)  before being substituted in the first-half . Crystal Palace Alan Pardew lamented his side's lack of cutting edge after the injury to Marouane Chamakh . Roberto Martinez, meanwhile, said that Everton are 'mentally refreshed' and ready to tackle Liverpool in the Merseyside derby after ending their eight-match winless streak at Selhurst Park. Martinez hailed his beleaguered side for turning the 'chore' of chasing victories into 'an opportunity', with Romelu Lukaku firing his second goal in three games. Belgian striker Lukaku has endured a tough month after the death of close friend and former Anderlecht academy team-mate Junior Malanda. And Martinez paised Lukaku's resilience in shrugging off a six-game goal drought across December, tipping the 21-year-old to fight back to top form. Everton's Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku has returned to form, scoring his second goal in three games . Lukaku had been suffering a goal drought and did not find the back of the net for six games in December . 'I've seen the players mentally refreshed now, we had a little bit of a break and I thought today we looked really strong mentally,' said Martinez, ahead of Everton hosting Liverpool next Saturday. 'It seemed an opportunity rather than a chore, to get the three points. 'Well the Merseyside derbies are always phenomenal events and they are games that almost look after themselves. 'Today was very important for us to face a team in the moment of form that Crystal Palace is, it was a real test. 'So it was one where we had to focus, and now we can really enjoy it and look forward to the Merseyside derby. Crystal Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni makes a good save under pressure from Everton's Aidan McGeady . 'I was pleased with Romelu's performance with the infectious way he was working in that forward line. 'I thought he looked powerful, I thought he looked really fresh and that was pleasing when you've got a striker like Romelu at that sort of level. 'I think we've all had a tough time as a team because we had such a high expectation of ourselves and when you don't reach those expectations it's going to be difficult. 'But I don't think Romelu has any reason to feel down about it, he's been an incredible footballer, he's a responsible young man. 'Sometimes we forget he's only 21, he came back from the World Cup and sometimes it's tough to get your match fitness up to speed. 'And now he's fully fit, he's ready, he loves taking responsibility. 'And he's a striker as we all know who has the potential to be if not the best, one of the best in world football.' Everton's Steven Naismith (left) battles for the ball with Crystal Palace midfielder James MacArthur (right) Aidan McGeady slides in to challenge Crystal Palace midfielder Joe Ledley in the game at Selhurst Park . Martinez said Saturday's victory at Selhurst Park was not about feeling relieved, though. 'More than relief it was real satisfaction, the last two performances in the league have been very, very good, and we didn't get the three points,' said Martinez. 'Today it felt we had to be perfect to get the three points because they are a team full of confidence who have been scoring with ease. 'When you look at a team that can score eight goals in the last three games it shows their form, so for me it's a real satisfaction. 'We scored early, and that's the hardest thing in football, to hold onto that lead in a place like Crystal Palace. 'We were the first ones not to enjoy us not getting wins consistently. We know what we can do, we know the expectations and that was difficult. 'We've got 15 games in the league, we want to show what we can do, and make sure we enjoy in Europe a really good run in the knockout stages.'

Mary Beard was targeted by trolls following her appearance on Question Time on Thursday, pictured . In a blog post for the Times Literary Supplement, the presenter said a torrent of abuse was posted on the Don’t Start Me Off website following her appearance, with many viewers concentrating on the way she looked. Professor Beard, 58, said she did not find any of the comments funny and likened the abuse to ‘vile playground bullying.’ One internet user described her as ‘a vile, spiteful excuse for a woman, . who eats too much cabbage and has cheese straws for teeth.’ Another added: ‘She’s an idiot who’s a disgrace to Cambridge Uni and .

Prof Beard, known to millions for her BBC Two series Meet The Romans, said that she would like to take her revenge for his ‘misogynist’ remarks by inviting him to attend a tutorial in her study to justify his opinions. She added, she said felt happy enough in her own skin not to bother with hair dye and make-up, and admitted to having ‘big, tombstone teeth’ and an ‘uncompromising double chin’. ‘I’m every inch the 57-year-old wife, mum and academic, half-proud of her wrinkles, her crow’s feet, even her hunched shoulders from all those misspent years poring over a library desk.’","The Cambridge University professor was attacked online for her looks .

If the 24-year-old, signed for £18.9million from Atletico Madrid in 2011, does not sign a new deal Real could land him for nothing at the end of next season — something United fans, and no doubt the club’s board, are desperate to avoid. De Gea’s agent Jorge Mendes recently said: ‘He’s a United player and has a contract there. You have to respect that but things change every five minutes.’ Van Gaal has been dealt another blow with the news that holding midfielder Michael Carrick will be out for a month with a calf injury. The 33-year-old, who has also played at centre half this season, is the latest in a long line of injury victims. ‘I think it will take more than four weeks,’ said Van Gaal. ‘It’s not a minor injury. A muscle rupture, I think.’ Red Devils manager Van Gaal has admitted his first choice goalkeeper could leave the club . Jorge Mendes, pictured with Radamel Falcao, has not ruled out the possibility of De Gea leaving Old Trafford . United vice-captain Michael Carrick has been ruled out for four weeks with a calf injury . Despite the loss of Carrick and Darren Fletcher, who is set to join West Ham, Van Gaal will not strengthen his squad in this transfer window. ‘We won’t be signing anyone,’ he said. ‘I’ve read every day that we are interested in players but I’m not interested in players.’ One man who could be following Fletcher out of the club is Brazilian midfielder Anderson. He is in talks with Internacional, in his homeland, and Van Gaal admitted a move was ‘possible’. It would end a miserable time at Old Trafford for Anderson, who moved from Porto in 2007. One new arrival was announced on Friday, as right back Sadiq El Fitouri joined from Salford City. The 20-year-old, previously on Manchester City’s books, was handed a chance by Paul Scholes and Phil Neville, who own stakes in the Evo-Stik Northern Premier League club. Anderson and Darren Fletcher are closing in on moves to Internacional and West Ham respectively . Sadiq El Fitouri has earned himself an 18-month deal after impressing during his week trial with United . They recommended El Fitouri to United and, after impressing in training, club officials saw enough to offer him an 18-month deal. Leicester’s last win at Old Trafford was in 1998 and United will look to improve a miserable record that has seen them score only 36 times in the Premier League this season. Van Gaal acknowledged it was an issue. ‘I don’t think we are not attractive enough,’ he said. ‘But we have to score more goals.’ Meanwhile, United are increasingly confident they will land Southampton right back Nathaniel Clyne — but not until the end of the season. Manchester United are said to be keen on signing Southampton right back Nathaniel Clyne .","David de Gea has been linked with a move to Spanish giants Real Madrid .

"Britain’s wealthiest MP Richard Benyon hands loaves of bread to local villagers through the window of his mansion house. The bizarre tradition emerged after the heir to a £125million family fortune lectured poor families for wasting food. The environment minister claimed too many people do not store fruit and vegetables correctly and could cut their shopping bills if they read food labels properly. He faced claims the government’s answer to poverty was to tell struggling families: ‘Let them eat leftovers.’ Feeding the poor: Britain's richest MP Richard Benyon, under fire for lecturing poor families on not wasting food, takes part in a tradition where the owner of Ufton Court in Berkshire hands local people loaves of bread through a window . Mr Benyon was today named as Britain’s wealthiest MP in The Times’ Rich List. The . former solider is valued at £110million as the son of Sir William . Benyon, a former Tory MP who owns the Englefield Estate in Berkshire and . is said to be worth £125million. Nestled on the estate is Ufton Court, which once a year stages the tradition of the landlord handing food to local people through a window. It dates back to 1581 when owner Lady Elizabeth Marvyn was rescued by villagers after getting lost in the woods. To thank those who came to her aid she began presenting bread and yards of cloth to the local poor every Maundy Thursday. She left money in her will for the tradition to continue for 'the poore of Ufton'. The Elizabethan manor house is used by an educational trust, but as landlord Mr Benyon played the part of lord of the manor for this picture in 2012. The government has been stung by criticism that it is out of touch after Mr Benyon claimed the average family wastes food worth £50-a-month. The minister suggested people were wrong to keep fruit in a bowl and instead should be packed in the fridge . Mr Benyon, who is the heir to the Englefield Estate near Reading in Berkshire, was accused of being out of touch . Mr Benyon told MPS: ‘We have been needlessly throwing away enormous amounts of food when it is perfectly safe to eat it. Richard Benyon lists cooking among his interests in his Who's Who entry. But his comments about food waste in the kitchen have landed him in hot water. The ministerial advice on how to store food is made more politically damaging by the fact that the 49-year-old was today named as Britain's richest MP. As the heir to the heir to former MP Sir William Benyon, he stands to inherit some £110million from the vast 20,000 acres Englefield Estate in Berkshire. Born in October 1960, he attended Bradfield College, a public school which counts former Foreign Secretary Lord Owen, cricketer Mark Nicholas and comedian Tony Hancock among its old boys. He studied for an statement management degree at the Royal Agricultural College - dubbed the Oxford for gentleman farmers - and served as a soldier in the Royal Green Jackets. He married Emma Villiers in 1988 and had three sons before divorcing. In 2004 he married Zoe Robinson and the couple have two sons. He was elected Tory MP for Newbury in 2005. A shooting and fishing enthusiast, he has courted controversy since becoming an environment minister in 2010, including sanctioning a cull of buzzards, selling off forests and cutting flood defences. ‘Food . wasted means fewer pounds in our pocket. Household bills are squeezed . at the moment and we have the opportunity through a variety of different . agencies to inform people better about where their food comes from and . how to use it most economically.’ Challenged . about the comments, Prime Minister David Cameron told the BBC: . ‘Obviously, that does not look good.’ But he suggested the comments had . been taken out of context. During a Commons debate on food waste, Mr Benyon went on to issue a raft of advice to families on how to store food at home. ‘Keeping most fruit in the fridge in its packaging can keep it fresher for a week or more, but around 60 per cent of us take fruit out of the packaging, and more than 70 per cent of us do not store it in the fridge. ‘Re-closing packs of cheese and sliced meats helps to stop them drying out in the fridge, but 13 per cent of us apparently store such food unwrapped in the fridge. ‘We can all pay attention to the storage information on food packaging, which will help us to store food at home so that it keeps fresher for longer.’ However, rising food prices have been blamed for piling pressure on families. Official figures today show fruit prices are more than 10 per cent higher than last year with vegetable costs up 6.7 per cent. Tory . MP Stephen McPartland said: ‘I don’t think it is right for the . Government to preach to people who choose to purchase food and use that . food. ‘Nobody likes waste . and families on low incomes often buy in bulk because it can be cheaper. No one in those families are wasting food intentionally,’ he told the . Telegraph. Paul Nowak, assistant general . secretary of the TUC, said: ‘Of course we should cut down on food waste . but Britain’s families need a change of economic policy rather than . domestic science lessons from cosseted ministers. ‘Mr . Benyon is out of touch with the squeeze on living standards if he . thinks careful fridge management will bring relief. It’s austerity . that’s past its sell-by date.’ Mary Creagh, Labour’s shadow environment, secretary, said: 'Mums struggling to feed their families don't need lectures on wrapping cheese from a Tory Government which has created a cost of living crisis with its failed economic plan. 'People are cutting back on food, eating less fresh meat, fruit and vegetables and foodbanks can barely cope. 'This out of touch Government's response to the cost of living crisis is condescension and a tax cut for millionaires.' Prime Minister David Cameron told the BBC the comments do 'not look good' but suggested they had been taken out of context . Mr Cameron, pictured as he speaks with workers during a visit to a small building site in Buckshaw Village in Chorley, Lancashire, insisted the government was working to help people on low incomes . Official figures show how food prices have risen sharply in the last 12 months . And Labour MP Michael Dugher added: ‘this Tory minister’s answer to rising poverty is basically, 'Let them eat leftovers’. It’s another crass, patronising and out-of-touch lecture from a minister.” But Mr Cameron insisted the government was working to help people on low incomes. The PM said: ‘The real truth here is we need to help families with their household bills, that’s why we’re freezing the council tax for the third year in a row, that’s why we’ve delivered a tax cut for 24m working people by lifting the amount you can earn before you start paying tax, that’s why we’ve cancelled fuel duty increase, we’ve cut the duty on beer, we’re getting behind working families who work hard and want to do the right thing and that is what we’re doing.’","Richard Benyon claims the average family wastes £50 of food a month .

"O.J. Simpson's lawyers submitted a super-sized appeal to the Nevada Supreme Court, seeking the former football star's release from prison and a new trial in his 2007 Las Vegas armed-robbery case. The lawyers met a midnight on Wednesday deadline to submit a request for them to review Simpson's claim that 2008 trial in Las Vegas was tainted by his fame and notoriety following his 1995 acquittal in Los Angeles in the deaths of his ex-wife and her friend. However, the document totaled 19,993 words, court spokesman Michael Sommermeyer said on Thursday. That was some 43 per cent longer than the 14,000-word length limit the court had set. O.J. Simpson during an evidentiary hearing at Clark County District Court in Las Vegas in January. Simpson's lawyers submitted a supersized appea on Wednesday asking the Nevada Supreme Court for a new trial in his 2007 Las Vegas armed robbery case . It will be up to the seven justices to decide whether to accept it for filing and consideration. Until that time, the document wasn't made public. The court hasn't decided whether to hear oral arguments. Simpson, 66, is serving nine to 33 years in a northern Nevada prison after being found guilty of leading a group of armed men in a September 2007 confrontation with two sports memorabilia dealers at a Las Vegas casino hotel. He was convicted of kidnapping, armed robbery and other charges. He's not eligible for parole until late 2017. The appeal stems from arguments rejected last year by Clark County District Court Judge Linda Marie Bell that Simpson's trial attorney botched Simpson's trial and first appeal to the state Supreme Court, the only appeals court in Nevada. Simpson attorney Patricia Palm said the appeal ran long because she and attorneys Ozzie Fumo and Tom Pitaro were responding in detail to the judge's November 26 ruling, which totaled 101 pages. Simpson's lawyers requested a new trial for their client saying his 2007 armed robbery court case was unfair because it was tainted by his notoriety. Simpson was acquitted in 1995 in the deaths of his wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend . The judge's decision stemmed from five days of hearings in Las Vegas on a 94-page petition Palm filed in May 2012 seeking a new trial on 22 possible grounds. The judge said she reviewed the entire Simpson court record and determined that evidence was overwhelming that Simpson orchestrated the armed kidnapping and robbery of two sports memorabilia dealers. Bell said Simpson's current attorneys failed to demonstrate how his former lawyer's actions changed the outcome of the case. Simpson claimed he was trying to retrieve from the memorabilia dealers items that had been stolen from him after his Los Angeles trial and a 1997 civil court a wrongful-death judgment that put him on the hook for $33.5 million to the estates his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman. The NFL hall of famer testified last year that he thought he had a right to get his own belongings back, and he never knew any of the men with him were carrying guns.","Simpson's lawyers claimed on Wednesday that the former sports star's .

Banned: Journalists look at arms and ammunition which military commanders say they seized from Islamic fighters, in Maiduguri, Nigeria. Boko Haram, the radical group that once attacked only government institutions and security forces, is increasingly targeting civilians . Boko Haram - which in the Hausa language spoken in northern Nigeria means 'Western education is sinful' - is loosely modelled on the Taliban movement in Afghanistan.  Boko Haram became active in around 2003 and is concentrated mainly in the northern Nigerian states. The group considers all who do not follow its strict ideology as infidels, whether they are Christian or Muslim. It demands the adoption of Islamic law, sharia, in all of Nigeria. Boko Haram followers have prayed in separate mosques in cities including Maiduguri, Kano and Sokoto, and wear long beards and red or black headscarves. In early July 2010, Abubakar Shekau, a former deputy leader of the sect who was thought to have been killed by police in 2009, appeared in a video and claimed leadership of the group. He said he was ready to launch attacks on western influences in Nigeria. Rights groups say more than 250 people have been killed by Boko Haram since July 2010. Minbar Ansar Deen - also known as Ansar . al-Sharia UK - promotes terrorism by distributing content through its . online forum, which encourages individuals to travel overseas to engage . in extremist activity, specifically fighting, the Home Office said. The Government said banning Boko Haram, which aspires to establish Islamic law in Nigeria, will prevent the group from operating in the UK and give the police powers to tackle any UK-based support for the group.

"On my first full day at the Anantara Layan hotel, I’m told that lunch will be cooked by... me. Perhaps this is pay-back time from dinner the night before, when the chef presented me with something I can only describe as edible art. I had been faced with amuse-bouches of olives hung on a miniature tree; a plump, pink disc of yellowfin tuna tartare; seabass smoked with Jack Daniel’s, revealed with a flourish from under an opaque glass dome. Blissful: Thailand offers gorgeous scenery - such as this picturesque isthmus on Ko Phi Phi Don island . It transpires that Anantara, on the northwest coast of Phuket, does things differently. To immerse guests fully in the local culture, a cooking school called Spice Spoons is offered - and you get thrown in at the deep end. It starts with an 8am visit to the food market in the small, dusty village of Talang, a ten-minute drive away, with the hotel’s chef. The market is a cavernous covered space full of stalls selling everything from fresh seafood on ice to buckets of coconut cream, and displays of garlic, ginger, green papaya, mint and more. There are containers of home-made red, green and yellow curry pastes, fragrant Thai basil and weird fermented cabbages. The cooking class takes place at the hotel’s Dee Plee Thai restaurant, which overlooks the rest of the sprawling resort (77 villas and suites). Two shades of Thailand: Street food is in constant supply in this intriguing country - as is a wealth of scenery . On the menu today are shrimp tartlets, green chicken curry and mango with sticky rice. Before I know it, I’m mixing batter for tartlet cases, marinading mini-aubergines in coconut milk and curry paste, and simmering the sticky rice (the trick is to ensure there is just a finger’s width of water over the rice). Phuket is roughly the same size as Singapore, with a population of 600,000. It is not particularly known for its charm - the notoriously tacky resort of Patong has put paid to that - but it is under two hours away from a truly exquisite archipelago that includes Phi Phi Leh (where The Beach was shot), Khai (home to nothing but a bar) and an island nicknamed ‘Bamboo’. A boat trip that takes in all these is the perfect way to get a flavour of what draws so many visitors. We speed across the turquoise water, passing giant granite islands covered in greenery, stopping off at Phi Phi Don, the larger sister island to Leh. Pausing to go snorkelling near a reef among swarms of colourful fish, we then pull in to Pileh Lagoon, a body of crystalline, emerald green water surrounded by more hulking stone outcrops of the kind you see on postcards. That evening, the head chef does the cooking, thankfully. He serves up a delicious soft-shell crab curry, a local dish called Khao Soi - a tangle of spicy, crispy egg noodles served with chicken, onion and lime - and a light coconut sorbet. Somehow, Thai food just doesn’t taste like this back home. A luxury haven: Laura rested her head at the gorgeous Anantara Hotel on Phuket . For a different island experience we also visit Layan’s sister resort, Rasananda, on the much smaller island of Koh Phangan. Its population of around 8,000 doubles once a month as hordes of partygoers descend on Haad Rin beach, to the south, for the infamous full moon parties which started here in the Eighties. Apart from those wild nights, though, it appeals mostly to families and couples, while Phuket draws a younger crowd. The Rasananda is bang on the beach, but has all the design touches of an elegant resort: an infinity pool featuring a swim-up bar, spa and 64 villas and suites, each with their own private plunge pool. Mine has a carp pond outside, and all have a free mini-bar. Everything seems to move at a different pace: slowly. But there’s plenty to do: snorkelling or kayaking around the Ang Thong National Marine Park - which contains more than 40 tiny islands - elephant trekking, communing with local monks, yoga every morning on the sun terrace. Yes, there is a cooking school here, too. And yes, I could sign up to perfect my Pad Thai - but I demur. It’s time to let someone else do the hard work.

"Lewis Hamilton sat down for contract talks with Mercedes on Sunday – 70 days after winning the world title. In blue-sky Jerez on the first-day of pre-season testing, Hamilton talked through his future with Toto Wolff, the head of Mercedes motorsport, and Niki Lauda, the chairman. Both sides spoke of striking a new deal – worth about £60million over three years – as a formality. Hamilton was effusive, saying: ‘We have talked. We can come to agreement. We want to stay together. We love each other, basically.’ Lewis Hamilton poses for a selfie with team-mate Nico Rosberg on the morning of the first winter test . Hamilton is bidding to win his third Formula One world title after he claimed the 2014 crown . Hamilton, who is in the final year of his Mercedes contract, will partner Rosberg once more in 2015 . Lauda said: ‘There is no problem with the contract. He wants to sign it. We want him to sign it. There is no rush. We just need to find a time to do it, and then all the speculation can go away.’ Logic says staying at Mercedes is the sensible option: they are the super-team of the moment. But Ferrari could yet intervene. Not only does the brand hold the greatest allure, not least to a driver whose avowed intent is to be ‘a legend’, but chairman Sergio Marchionne is an avid Hamilton fan. They could also potentially offer him more money than Mercedes, whose budget could be restricted by their board in Stuttgart. Hamilton held talks with Niki Lauda and Toto Wolff over a new deal with Mercedes in Jerez on Sunday . Hamilton and Rosberg unveil the 2015 Mercedes car, which they hope will be the cream of the crop again . According to one contact there has already been contact between Ferrari and Hamilton. However, a reliable source close to Hamilton denies this is the case. Either way, there could be a space at Ferrari next season if they release Kimi Raikkonen, whose contract expires at the end of the year. So why the delay? ‘We left it until the end of last year, but then we didn’t see one another,’ said Hamilton, who takes over driving duties from team-mate Nico Rosberg on Monday. ‘I’m still under contract this year, so we have time. It’s not something I have to rush to satisfy anyone else.’ Fernando Alonso completed only six laps on the first day of the season's opening winter test in Jerez . Hamilton confirmed that Alonso, now of McLaren, rang Mercedes about joining them last year . Mercedes’ strength heading into the new season, which starts in Melbourne on March 15, was underlined by Rosberg doing a massive 157 laps. His high mileage was in contrast to the McLaren-Honda of Fernando Alonso, who, as Hamilton confirmed, rang Mercedes about joining them last year. He did six laps. The Spaniard was the star attraction for a large home crowd who hung around the paddock. But, with McLaren coming to terms with their new engine, there is plenty of road for them to travel.","Lewis Hamilton sat down for talks with the Mercedes hierarchy in Jerez .

"A mother-of-four has written an hilarious open letter to her son's female Facebook friends, warning them they will be blocked if they post sexual 'selfies'. Kim Hall, who lives in Austin, Texas with her husband, their three sons and a daughter, wrote the post entitled 'FYI (If You're a Teenage Girl)' on her blog on Tuesday. It has since been viewed more than five million times and has received support from thousands of moms from across the country - although others slammed it for being 'self-righteous'. 'Dear ladies,' the post on Given Breath begins, before slating the girls for uploading images of sexual poses in their bedrooms to Facebook and urging them to have more self respect. Warning: Kim Hall, pictured with one of her sons, wrote a terse letter to her sons' girl friends on her blog, warning them that if they continued to post sexual photographs of themselves, she would block them on their Facebooks . 'We have teenage sons, and so . naturally there are quite a few pictures of you lovely ladies to wade . through,' she wrote. 'Wow – you sure took a bunch of selfies in your . pajamas this summer! 'Your bedrooms are so cute! Our eight-year-old daughter brought this to our attention, because with three older brothers who have rooms that smell like stinky cheese, she notices girly details like that.' But Hall, who is the director of women's ministry at All Saints PCA in Austin, said that teen boys will notice other things: 'For one, it appears that you are not wearing a bra,' she wrote. She also quizzed the girls about why they are striking 'red-carpet poses' before going to bed. 'What's up?,' she asked. 'None of these positions is one I naturally assume before sleep, this I know.' She said that, while it appeared as if . she was giving the girls a hard time for their choices of pictures, she . was in fact encouraging them to celebrate the best parts of themselves. Tickled: Mrs Hall, pictured with her family, poked fun at the girls for their pouts and sultry bedroom poses . Having a laugh: She urged girls to take down their selfies which she said were not natural sleeping poses . 'Those posts don’t reflect who you are!' she wrote. 'We think you are lovely and interesting, and usually very smart. But... what are you trying to say?' She said that she regularly checks her sons' social media pages with them and, if they discover images such as the sultry poses, friends will be blocked because she cares about what the boys see. Hall added that there are no second . chances and that those who wish to stay friendly with the family must . keep their 'clothes on'. 'If . you try to post a sexy selfie, or an inappropriate YouTube video – even . once – you'll be booted off our on-line island,' she wrote. She acknowledged that some people may . think her actions are 'old-school' but that she simply wanted to raise . boys with 'a strong moral compass'. Close: She said she was being 'old school' as she wants her boys to grow up with a strong moral compass . Encouragement: Mrs Hall, who has one daughter (pictured), told the girls they were beautiful on the inside and out and didn't need to post the pictures on Facebook to prove anything . 'Every day I pray for the women my boys will love,' she wrote. 'I hope they will be drawn to real beauties, the kind of women who will leave them better people in the end. 'I also pray that my sons will be worthy of this kind of woman, that they will be patient – and act honorably – while they wait for her.' She urged girls to take down their previously posted inappropriate selfies. 'You are growing into a real beauty, inside and out,' she said to the girls. 'Act like her, speak like her, post like her.' The blog post received mixed . responses from readers - mostly because Mrs Hall had included photos of . her sons in bathing suits to accompany the words. After some readers said this gave a confusing message, she re-posted the blog with images of the boys with their clothes on. Mixed responses: The original post sparked confusion as it included shirtless pictures of her sons . Critical: She slammed teenage girls for taking inappropriate 'selfies' - pictures they take of themselves (file picture) But some readers still took issue with her opinions and delivery. 'I understand the point your article was trying to make,' one wrote, 'but you came across as holier than thou rather than a humble servant of God. I would rather have seen you rewrite the article with a less judgmental tone than just repost it with new pictures and a snarky new title.' Yet others thanked the mother for the letter, with one writing: 'Way to go, Kim! As a mom of two boys and two girls, I agree with you 100%!' The blog post has been read more than five million times, she wrote on Facebook on Wednesday. Mrs Hall lives with her husband David in Austin, Texas, where she serves as the director of women's ministry at All Saints PCA and owns a team fitness and coaching company. Excerpts from Kim Hall's open letter, which can be found in full on her blog: . Dear girls, .

But then I can’t help but notice the red carpet pose, the extra-arched back, and the sultry pout. What’s up? None of these positions is one I naturally assume before sleep, this I know... Those posts don’t reflect who you are! We think you are lovely and interesting, and usually very smart. But what are you trying to say? And now – big bummer – we have to block your posts.

In our house, there are no second chances, ladies. If you want to stay friendly with the Hall men, you’ll have to keep your clothes on, and your posts decent... I know that sounds harsh and old-school, but that’s just the way it is under this roof for a while. We hope to raise men with a strong moral compass...

"It might have taken eight years and £8,000 to build and have a flying time of just 18 seconds, but the designer of a pedal-powered aeroplane says he is delighted with his creation. Formula one engineer David Barford, 42, who makes a living constructing racing car engines, built the unique man-powered plane in his own garage. And when Betterfly took off from Sywell Aerodrome, Northamptonshire, in June, it became the first ever man-powered aircraft to take to the skies from the airport. Scroll down for video . David Barford, 42, takes to the skies in his unique, £8,000 pedal-powered aircraft . David, from East Hunsbury, Northamptonshire, said that making the aircraft has fulfilled a childhood dream: 'Ever since I was a child I would build things - it started with model aeroplanes but soon turned to wanting to create the real thing. 'At the age of seven, I would go to the library and read about human powered aircraft and that’s where the love came from.' Betterfly has a wing-span of 20 metres and is purposely made to be as light as possible from special carbon. It is powered solely by the pilot who pedals it like a bicycle. Engineer David and Dr Bill Brooke getting set for take off in the Flintstones-style plane . David said: 'It was built on strength-to-weight radio so it is both resilient and flexible. 'I’ve made everything myself - and even bought a seven metre long oven so I could mould carbon around the shell.' The device is larger than most man-powered planes as he wanted to be able to fit in it himself. He said: 'Other planes that are man-powered have been built for someone who is extremely fit and slender to pedal. 'Unfortunately, I am not an Olympic athlete and wanted to be able to fly my own plane so I’ve made it slightly bigger and possible for me to power myself.' David Barford says that although it may look dangerous, flying his aircraft is no more dangerous than cycling . David asked someone with experience in flying man-powered planes - Dr Bill Brooke - to take the controls for the first time so he could concentrate on where improvements needed to be made. David said: 'I was overjoyed when I first saw it fly - it was almost a miracle to see it take off. 'When the wings took lift, you could hear the cheers of the crowds who had come to support us - it was a great feeling.' David was delighted that flights in his plane last around 18 seconds at a speed of about 17mph. He said: 'It flew like a dream. I was completely prepared for it to fail, but it went marvellously. David Barford said it was 'almost a miracle' to see the aircraft, which he had spent £8,000 and eight years building, take off . 'There’s a fine line between it breaking because it hasn’t been built properly or being too heavy so it wouldn’t take flight  - luckily we got it just right. 'It’s a very special feeling to sit there pedalling and then be lifted into the air - it totally fulfilled my dreams. 'You pedal really hard and then all of a sudden you are pedalling in mid-air, it’s very surreal and you feel like a puppet.' During the week, Mr Barford works at the Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines factory in Brixworth, working on engines for Formula 1 drivers including Jenson Button and Michael Schumacher. David added: 'People think it’s quite high-risk flying a man-powered plane but the risk is pretty low. 'If you were to fall, it would only be about as bad as a push-bike crash.' Now Betterfly has completed its maiden flight at Sywell, it will take part in a national competition for human-powered flying machines. The Royal Aeronautical Society’s Icarus Cup competition will be held in Hampshire from July 13th to the 23rd. During the competition, Betterfly will compete against other man-powered planes in races, endurance tests and a slalom challenge. x .","David Barford, 42, says that the pedal-powered aircraft which he built in his garage for £8,000, fulfils a childhood dream for him .

"Wilfried Bony finally broke his Africa Cup of Nations duck, as his two goals put the Ivory Coast into the semi-finals of the competition. Before Sunday night, Bony had not scored since becoming Africa's most expensive footballer last month, and the Manchester City man struggled for form so far at this tournament, finding chances hard to come by, and even harder to take. But against the tournament favourites he twice headed his country in front, the second coming from a cross by his new team-mate Yaya Toure.

Bony (out of shot) heads home a Yaya Toure free-kick to give Ivory Coast a 2-1 lead in the second half . Bony wheels away to celebrate his second goal of the night, which turned out to be the winner . Ivory Coast: Gbohouo, Aurier, Bailly, Toure, Kanon, Tiene (Diomande 67), Gradel, Toure, Serey Die, Gervinho, Bony (Tallo 90) Goals: Bony (2), Gervinho . Subs not used: Barry, Diarrassouba, Assale, Doukoure, Doumbia, Kalou Akpa-Akpro, Traore, Mande . Algeria: M'Bolhi, Mandi, Bougherra, Medjani, Ghoulam, Taïder, Bentaleb, Feghouli, Brahimi, Mahrez (Slimani 72 mins), Soudani (Belfodil 72) Subs not used: Doukha, Cadamuro, Halliche, Mesbah, Lacen, Zemmamouche, Kadir, Djabou, Kashi, Zeffane . Goals: Soudani . Booked: Bentaleb, Taider . In between Hilal Soudani had levelled things up, keeping his calm to finish from close range after Riyad Mahrez had taken advantage of some dreadful defending. But the Ivorians withstood heavy pressure from the tournament favourites, before a last-minute Gervinho strike sealed their passage to a last-four clash with DR Congo. After a slow start, when the first opportunity fell Bony’s way in the 26th minute, he could scarcely have asked for a simpler task. Max Gradel, the Ivorians’ player of the tournament so far, put a cross into the box for Bony to attack, and the Algerian defence simply stood and watched as the Manchester City striker met it. Rais Mbolhi in goal, rather like his team-mates, put more effort into appealing for offside than stopping Bony from scoring, so by the time the big forward headed the ball he was six yards out, unmarked, and with a keeper standing still with his hands in the air. For the Premier League’s top goalscorer in 2014, it was unmissable. Algeria hit back through Soudani, but Bony rose brilliantly at the near post to head Toure’s free kick home and keep his side on course for their first Cup of Nations title since 1992. Following both goals Herve Renard’s side sat deep and invited the Desert Foxes onto them, playing an organised game and using their pace on the break. Ex-Arsenal man Gervinho slots the ball into the bottom corner to give Ivory Coast a two-goal advantage . Roma forward Gervinho celebrates after finishing off a counter attack in stoppage time to make it 3-1 . Algeria forward El Arabi Soudani (centre) celebrates with his team-mates after finding the back of the net . Ivory Coast's Eric Bailly (left) wins a header under pressure from Algeria's Riyad Mahrez . Algeria have struggled to break down organised defences all tournament, and the Ivorians proved an obstinate nut to crack. Yacine Brahimi sweezed between defenders on the left hand side early on to cause slight panic in the box, but when Sylvain Gbohouo flapped at the ball it wouldn’t fall kindly for Soudani. It was actually the Elephants who looked more likely to score when they got on the break, both Gervinho and Gradel causing Faouzi Ghoulam problems down the right wing. Neither winger could find much end product, but while their defence kept the Algerians at arm’s length, it looked like being enough. However the north Africans came out strongly at the start of the second half, and a long ball over the Ivorian defence saw Gbohouo inexplicably charge out of his goal.

Serey Die of the Ivory Coast (right) drives forward as Tottenham's Nabil Bentaleb attempts to tackle him . Manchester City new boy Bony tussles for the ball with Algeria's Bentaleb during the first half . The ball broke to Mahrez who found Soudani in the six-yard-box. The striker – the only man in the Algerian starting line-up born in the country, with the rest French-Algerians – kept his cool to smash it home. Buoyed by their goal the Algerians pushed on, and Soudani should have had a second, but his shot from point blank range was brilliantly saved following Feghouli’s scuffed shot across the face of goal. Bony’s goal brought an even more concerted effort from the Desert Foxes, but they rarely looked like scoring. Ghoulam came the closest to forcing the game to extra time with a freekick that forced Gbohouo into a fine save, while Liverpool’s Kolo Toure produced an excellent block late on. But the Ivorians held on, with Gervinho calmly converting a counter-attack deep into stoppage time, and they must surely now be the favourites for a major title that has thus far eluded the ‘golden generation’.","Wilfried Bony opened the scoring with a header in the 24th minute .

"Claims: Newly elected President Mohammed Morsi . Radical members of the Muslim Brotherhood have started 'crucifying opponents of newly installed President Mohammed Morsi,' claimed unconfirmed media reports. 'During a recent rampage, Muslim Brotherhood operatives . crucified those opposing Egyptian President Muhammad Morsi naked on . trees in front of the presidential palace while abusing others,' reported WMD, quoting Middle East media. Raymond Ibrahim, a fellow with the Middle East Forum and the Investigative Project on Terrorism, told the website 'the crucifixions are the product of who the Middle Eastern media call partisans.' The Algemeiner backed up the claims and said that several news outlets including Arab News, Al Khabar News, Dostor Watany, and Egypt Now reported that people were being 'crucified.' They said the Muslim Brotherhood supporters were specifically targeting 'secular media.' A media crackdown in the first month of . Mohamed Mursi's rule has raised fears Egypt's Islamist president is . moving to stifle criticism of the Muslim Brotherhood. This week, formal accusations by state . prosecutors were filed against two journalists, while an issue of the . newspaper al-Dostour was confiscated by the state's censorship unit - . disappointing those who believed last year's overthrow of President . Hosni Mubarak would lead to greater media freedom. Supporters of Egypt's President Mohamed Mursi carry an Egyptian flag as they chant slogans in front of a military vehicle carrying army officers, near the presidential palace in Cairo . Mursi, who resigned from the Muslim . Brotherhood when he was elected in June, saying he wanted to represent . all Egyptians, has also named Salah Abdel Maqsood, a former colleague . from the Islamist group, as information minister. 'The Brotherhood's recent actions . against the media are harsh and unacceptable and tell us that we are . going backwards and that things are managed the same way they were . during Mubarak's time,' said rights activist Gamal Eid. The . crackdown on media is also worrying the United States, which for years . has secured the loyalty of one of the Arab world's most influential . states with substantial financial aid, now running at about $1.55 . billion a year. State Department spokeswoman Victoria . Nuland said on Thursday that Washington was 'concerned by reports that . the Egyptian government is moving to restrict media freedom and . criticism in Egypt.' Women shout slogans against Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi and the Muslim Brotherhood during a funeral for soldiers, who were killed during an attack at a checkpoint along the Sinai border with Israel . The Brotherhood has repeatedly denied any intention to censor opinion, saying it wants only to stop media reports which might incite violence or unrest, or which personally insult the president. One of the two charged journalists is Islam Afifi, the editor of the daily al-Dostour newspaper, whose Aug. 11 issue was confiscated . 'Those who filed the complaints against the journalists with the public prosecutor are not all from the Brotherhood. 'There . were also ordinary people upset about the disgusting insults that some . media have been publicising,' said Brotherhood spokesman Mahmoud . Ghozlan. One of the . two charged journalists is Islam Afifi, the editor of the daily . al-Dostour newspaper, whose Aug. 11 issue was confiscated. Afifi was . sent to a criminal court after the state's public prosecutor charged him . with insulting Mursi and inciting the overthrow of Egypt's ruling . system. The other one . is Tawfiq Okasha, owner and the main host of an Egyptian television . channel called Al-Faraeen who was also sent to a criminal court on . accusations of inciting people to kill Mursi and insulting him. The prosecutor ordered the channel be taken off air. Al-Faraeen . TV channel is privately owned by Okasha, a strong opponent of Mursi and . Islamists. Okasha had previously said in one of his talkshows that . Mursi and his group 'deserve to get killed'. A Brotherhood lawyer also filed a complaint on Wednesday with a state prosecutor, accusing three prominent editors of Egyptian dailies including Afifi of insulting Mursi. 'I accused them of insulting the president and spreading false information that could destroy the state and create panic among the people,' lawyer Ismail al-Washahy told Reuters. 'Most of what they published had nothing to do with media but were pure insults with no proof,' he added.",Middle East media: 'Crucified those opposing Egyptian President Muhammad Morsi naked on trees in front of the presidential palace while abusing others'
"It's a sign of how far Adnan Januzaj's stock has fallen at Manchester United that few would have been surprised to see the precocious youngster leave Old Trafford on loan before the transfer window closes on Monday night. Such a scenario would have been unthinkable when Januzaj signed a five-year contract worth £30,000-a-week just 15 months ago. He was a shining light amid the gloom of the brief David Moyes era, and United fought tooth and nail to keep him from the clutches of their European rivals, notably Paris Saint-Germain. Januzaj has faded under Louis van Gaal, however. On Saturday, he made his first Premier League start since November 8 — one week short of three months — on the left side of a midfield diamond. Adnan Januzaj (right) made his first Premier League start since November 8 against Leicester . Januzaj is surrounded by three Leicester players during Manchester United's 3-1 on Saturday afternoon . Marcin Wasilewski's late consolation for Leicester was the 300th goal Manchester United have conceded in the Premier League at Old Trafford. It was only the sixth time in all competitions that Van Gaal has named the Belgium international in his line-up since taking over in the summer. Questions remain over how he fits into the new system when United have so many other attacking options. PSG and Inter Milan are among the clubs who inquired about a loan deal but United decided to keep him for now. However, Januzaj is 20 on Thursday. Potential alone is no longer enough. His performance against Leicester could at best be described as lively, but he still lacks the confidence and end product that marked him out as a star of the future last season. Van Gaal has told the player that he must start making the most of his undoubted promise to be part of United's first-team plans. Januzaj has only made six starts under Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal so far this season . Van Gaal, pictured shaking hands with Esteban Cambiasso, wants Januzaj to start fulfilling his potential . Robin van Persie put his side ahead against Leicester with this first-time finish past Mark Schwarzer . The Dutchman celebrates his 27th minute opener after netting his ninth Premier League goal of the season . 'He has a lot of talent but you have to perform that talent in the matches and also in the training sessions,' said the United boss. 'I'm not making the line-up, the players themselves are making the line-up. You don't believe that, I think. 'I observe and I communicate with my players what I want every day. At the moment I think 'okay, he is now ready to play' then maybe I can let them play. 'I have to compare Januzaj with Juan Mata and now I choose Januzaj. I'm looking every week and every day the players have to show it. I've said this to the players, to Falcao, Mata and Januzaj. 'The competition is high and also that's difficult to manage for players.' United avenged their shock 5-3 defeat Leicester in September, easing to victory with first-half efforts from Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao and an own-goal by Wes Morgan. Radamel Falcao poked home from close range to score his fourth goal for Manchester United . Manchester United striker Falcao slides on his knees after doubling his side's lead in the 32nd minute . Wayne Rooney hugs Van Persie as United's players eased to another victory at Old Trafford . It remains to be seen if Januzaj makes his third start in a row in Tuesday's FA Cup replay against Cambridge, having played in the goalless draw at the Abbey Stadium. 'I haven't played too much, so it was good to get 90 minutes,' he said. 'I was tired and had cramp in the last 15 minutes, but I knew I had a job to do.' Old Trafford sources maintain that there are unlikely to be any signings before the window closes despite continued speculation linking United with a £37.5million bid for PSG defender Marquinhos, who is valued at closer to £50m by the French champions. The Brazilian is one of a number of defenders United have enquired about in recent months and fits Van Gaal's criteria of a player who can operate at centre back or right back. However, it is understood that any deal will have to wait until the summer. Two players who could still leave Old Trafford before the deadline are midfielders Darren Fletcher and Anderson. Fletcher's representatives are in talks with West Bromwich Albion after his move to West Ham broke down over the weekend, while Internacional want to take Anderson back to Brazil.","Adnan Januzaj made his first start since November 8 against Leicester .

"Lionel Messi scored the winner as Barcelona came back twice against Villarreal to win a five-goal thriller at the Camp Nou on Sunday night. For a while it looked as if Real Madrid loanee Denis Cheryshev would derail Barca’s pursuit of the league leaders but, with a little help from Neymar - who also scored - and Luis Suarez - who made two of Barcelona’s three goals - Messi ensured the home side took all three points. Barcelona almost broke the deadlock on 12 minutes when Alves intelligently pulled the ball back for Suarez, who shot first time from the edge of the area only for Sergio Asenjo to fingertip it away for a corner.

BARCELONA (4-3-3): Bravo; Pique, Mascherano, Alba, Alves; Busquets (Mathieu 72), Iniesta, Rafinha (Rakitic 88); Suarez (Pedro 79), Messi, Neymar . Goals: Neymar (45), Rafinha (53), Messi (55) Booking: Rafinha . VILLARREAL (4-4-2): Asenjo; Gaspar, Musacchio, Ruiz, Costa; Pina (Trigueros 77), J Dos Santos (Gomez 85), Cheryshev, Soriano, Vietto, G Dos Santos (Uche 89) Goals: Cheryshev (30), Vietto (52) Bookings: Ruiz, Soriano, J Dos Santos . Cheryshev was already a threat, beating Alves down the Villarreal left only for Gerard Pique to block his cross. Villarreal were coming into the game on a run of 18 matches unbeaten and looked determined to not lose that record at the Camp Nou. For Barcelona, midfielder Rafinha - called up for Ivan Rakitic - had started the game brightly and when Victor Ruiz chopped him down Leo Messi had the chance to test Asenjo but his free-kick was headed out for a corner. Messi then so nearly found Andres Iniesta with a cross to the back post that the midfielder just failed to make contact with. Barca went close again and once more it was Suarez who was denied. Alves’ pass was laid off by Rafinha and the former Liverpool striker’s curling shot went just past Asenjo’s left-hand post. The lively Rafinha continued to pose a threat and, when he was chopped down by Bruno, the midfielder was booked. Barcleona had only conceded nine goals in the league but on the half-hour mark they let in No 10 and it was the Real Madrid loanee who got it. Cheryshev wants to go back to Madrid at the end of the season and he did his chances no harm diverting Mario’s shot past Claudio Bravo after Mascherano’s poor clearance had run straight to the full back. Villarreal, who will face Barcelona twice more in the Copa del Rey semi-finals in the coming weeks, increasingly looked to have the measure of their rivals. But just as it looked as if they would make it to half-time in front, Neymar struck with his 21st goal of the season. Messi played in Rafinha whose shot was parried for the Brazilian to convert the rebound. Cheryshev runs off with his arms aloft in celebration after giving Villarreal the lead after 30 minutes .

The tide however had not turned completely and with Villarreal playing the same swift counter-attacking football in the second half they were soon back in front. Pique hadn’t put a foot wrong all night but lost possession to Giovani dos Santos and he crossed for Luciano Vietto to score. It what was now developing into the one of the games of the season - and Barcelona’s response was almost immediate. Iniesta played Suarez in behind Mario and he crossed for Messi. When the Argentine’s effort was saved Rafinha converted the rebound. Two minutes later Barcelona were ahead and again Suarez was the provider, nudging the ball to Messi on the edge of the area for Barcelona’s top scorer to sweep the home side into the lead. It was his 342nd goal in his last 342 games for the club. Villarreal still wouldn’t lie down and Ruiz scrambled the ball in at the back post only for a linesman’s flag to cut short the visitors’ joy. Barcelona then thought they had won a penalty as Asenjo charged into Neymar as the Brazilian was through on goal. Perhaps judging that he had already gone to ground as he lunged to send the ball past the keeper, the referee did not point to the spot and Suarez just failed to head in at the back post as the attack continued with Neymar down. Now finally in front, Barcelona were not going to let it slip. With Manchester City on the horizon they have found a team spirit that has helped them beat Atletico Madrid twice since the turn of the year and now overcome their toughest test of the season so far at the Nou Camp.

"The legendary director has sights set on Sydney for Prometheus 2 . Scott was spotted getting a VIP tour of the Fox Studios lot on Wednesday . Production staff flown in from Melbourne and Gold Coast for meetings . The 'news couldn't come at a better time' for Australian film industry . He's one of the greatest living filmmakers and it seems Sir Ridley Scott has his sights set on Australia to film his next science-fiction blockbuster. The 76-year-old director flew into Sydney on Wednesday morning and is said to be scouting film locations for his next project: Prometheus 2. Scott was seen taking a VIP tour of the Fox Studios lot in Sydney on that same day, with the Australian industry abuzz about the project. Scroll down for video . Down Under: Sir Ridley Scott arrived at Sydney airport on Wednesday to begin a 'secret project' which we now know is Prometheus 2 . 'It's the best kept secret at the moment, that Ridley is here to film the Prometheus sequel,' an insider told the MailOnline. 'Staff have been pulled off productions on the Gold Coast and Melbourne to take meetings about it. 'The news couldn't come at a better time, with Gods Of Egypt and San Andreas wrapping soon people were looking for the next project.' The source said he and several other well-placed professionals only became aware of the project when Scott touched ground at Sydney airport on Wednesday, with pre-production remaining tight-lipped. Sci-fi epic: Michael Fassbender starred in the first Prometheus and said he is returning for the sequel . Secret sequel: The 76-year-old director is said to be scouting locations in Australia and has been seen on the Fox Studios lot . The pioneering filmmaker - best known for films such as Blade Runner and Gladiator - filmed the first Prometheus film at the famous Shepperton and Pinewood Studios in the UK. With a production budget of $130 million, the sci-fi epic was a prequel to Scott's 1979 classic Alien and set within the same universe. Starring Noomi Rapace, Charlize Theron, Michael Fassbender and Idris Elba, the film was a commercial hit - taking over $403million at the international box-office. Sydney's Fox Studios seems like the perfect home for the feature - which is a franchise of 20th Century Fox - given its world-class facilities, which have seen two Wolverine films, The Great Gatsby and Superman Returns among some of the blockbusters that have shot there.

Gerard Butler and Geoffrey Rush are  in production on Alex Proyas' mythological blockbuster Gods Of Egypt, which is shooting at Fox Studios currently. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson's 3D earthquake film San Andreas is being filmed on the Gold Coast at Warner Brothers Village Roadshow studios, and is the only other large scale blockbuster in Australia at the moment. Rumour has it that Scott is looking at a multi-picture agreement with Screen Australia to also film Blade Runner 2 in Australia some time in early 2015. Alien prequel: Prometheus was set before the events in Scott's 1979 classic Alien . Frequent collaborators: Russell Crowe and Scott have worked together on several projects, including Robin Hood but also the role that won Crowe an Oscar: Gladiator . The British director previously described scenes from the sequel to the 1982 film as needing 'vast farmland where there's no hedges or anything else in sight... where you can see for miles, but it's dirt' - which would fit with several Australian filming locations. Such locations were used for scenes in Mad Max: Fury Road and Wolf Creek 2. While promoting his latest film X-Men: Days Of Future Past, Fassbender recently confirmed that he will be returning to work with Scott on Prometheus 2, re-joining Rapace. The film is set for a March 4, 2016, release and is set to start filming this year.

"Read the full match report from the KC Stadium . When Steve Bruce last met his hometown club in September, Hull led by two with 20 minutes to play and were up into the top four. Newcastle’s Alan Pardew was under attack from the terraces and the Tigers boss was being touted as his replacement. Papiss Cisse, of course, came from the bench to rescue a point for the Magpies, Pardew kept his job and Hull embarked on a ruinous run which, four months and 11 defeats later, leaves them in the bottom three, Bruce is the new favourite in the Premier League sack race. ‘I don’t fear for my job. It’s part and parcel, it’s my turn,’ said the under-fire manager, whose side were booed following Saturday’s 3-0 reverse having now lost four on the spin without scoring a goal. Despondent Hull players lost their fourth consecutive game without scoring in the 3-0 defeat by Newcastle . Manager Steve Bruce is not concerned at losing his job and insists the Tigers can survive relegation . This was the first time Newcastle have scored three goals away from home since their 4-1 win at Hull in March of last year. ‘I’ve been in it long enough to roll up my sleeves. The one thing I’m not going to do is chuck it in. I’ve had a great two and a half years here. ‘We’ve got enough here to stay up and I’m convinced we will do.’ There was precious little evidence to support that conviction at the weekend. Newcastle, thanks to stunning goals from Remy Cabella and Sammy Ameobi and Yoan Gouffran’s late strike, gave John Carver an easy first victory as head coach. On Monday, Bruce will turn to three men he hopes can salvage Hull’s season. Former Manchester United assistant boss Mike Phelan arrives as his new No.2, while Spurs winger Aaron Lennon and Lokomotiv Moscow striker Dame N’Doye are expected to sign before transfer deadline. Ahmed Elmohamady had a goal disallowed after clearly punching the ball past Newcastle keeper Tim Krul . Sammy Ameobi is congratulated by his team-mates after the striker scores Newcastle's second . Gaston Ramirez buries his face into the turf after missing a chance for Hull during Saturday's clash . Bruce, though, hopes the pair did not watch their sorry showing against Newcastle. ‘I have to say, performances like that don’t do us any favours (in signing players),’ he said. ‘But we hope to get them in, it’s up to the individuals now. ‘They will be a goal threat. Something up the top end of the pitch might just open up the door for us. ‘That’s 12 times out of the last 16 we’ve not scored. We’ve made enough chances but we haven’t scored. Newcastle had four shots and they scored three goals, therein lies the difference.’ On Phelan, he added: ‘I’ve known Mick a long time. He’s the right man at the right time. He should give everyone a lift.’ Former Manchester United coach Mike Phelan will arrive as Bruce's assistant on Monday . Bruce wants to bring in Tottenham winger Aaron Lennon (left) and Lokomotiv striker Dame N'Doye in January . Newcastle’s victory, meanwhile, was their first of 2015 and Carver believes he can now win the job on a permanent basis having told the players not to view his appointment as a temporary measure. ‘One of the first things I did with the group was to get them together and say that this is not an interim position,’ he said. ‘If you look at the title it is not interim head coach, it is head coach. I said to the guys, “Listen, I'm in this position, we have got 16 games to go and our season starts now"".' Bruce, too, will be hoping for new beginnings with Phelan by his side.","Hull City were defeated 3-0 by Newcastle in the Premier League .

"Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp - the king of transfer deadline day - is set for another frantic few hours of potential late deals. Loan moves for Tottenham duo Emmanuel Adebayor and Aaron Lennon will be explored by Rangers today, as will a swoop for Wolves forward Bakary Sako.. Redknapp is desperate to bolster his forward line before Monday's deadline and is ready to look at his former club for reinforcements. Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor could seal a deadline-day switch to Queens Park Rangers . Hull City target Aaron Lennon is also said to be on Redknapp's transfer wish-list . Jonathan Walters became the first PL player to complete a perfect hat-trick since Kevin Nolan and Romelu Lukaku in May 2013. Adebayor was brought to White Hart Lane by Redknapp, who is keen to strike an agreement with his ex-employers over a temporary switch until the end of the season. The major stumbling block towards a deal will be the striker's wages, which are said to be around £100,000-per-week. Rangers will need Spurs to supplement a large portion of Adebayor's salary, a stipulation White Hart Lane chairman Daniel Levy, who is a notorious tough negotiator, will be reluctant to agree to. Adebayor's future is set to be one of the prevalent issues of transfer deadline. Stoke City manager Mark Hughes is also understood to be keen on taking the striker from Spurs, who will listen to offers for the former Manchester City and Arsenal man. Paris St Germain have also shown an interest in Adebayor. Rangers are also preparing to pounce for Lennon, should his proposed switch to Hull collapse. The winger looked set for a loan move to the Tigers, with a view to a permanent switch in the summer. Wolves forward Bakary Sako is attracting interest from Premier League duo QPR and West Brom . But there has been a dispute between the two clubs over who will pay the majority of his £55,000-per-week wages until the end of the season. Spurs have been alerted to the situation regarding Lennon, who is a long term target for Redknapp, and QPR could pounce if the issue isn't resolved. Meanwhile, Sako remains a target for the Hoops after Redknapp admitted his interest in the forward last week. The Hoops’ need for reinforcements was clear at Stoke on Saturday. Their record 11th consecutive away defeat proved too much for midfielder Joey Barton, who said: ‘Umpteen times this season we’ve been our own worst enemy and it’s not f*****g good enough.’ Stoke’s Jonathan Walters helped himself to a ‘perfect hat-trick’ — one scored with his left foot, one with his right and the final one with his head.","QPR boss Harry Redknapp is eager to bolster his options before deadline .

"Iranian women footballers will be required to undergo mandatory gender-testing after it was revealed that four players in the national women’s team were in fact men. Medical examiners will conduct random checks at training sessions and any players who fail the examination and cannot prove that they are completely female will be barred from the competition. Iran’s football governing body announced the random checks after it was revealed that several leading players, including four in the national women’s team, were men who had not completed sex change operations or who were suffering from sexual development disorders, reported the Telegraph. Under investigation: Four members of Iran's women's national football team (pictured in red) were revealed to be men prompting the football federation to order all players to undergo gender testing . Sex change operations have been legal in Iran since 1979, when the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a religious ruling saying they were acceptable. The legality of sex change procedures contrasts with the country’s otherwise strict laws regarding sexual morality under the nation’s Sharia code, which forbids homosexuality and pre-marital sex, among other things. While those who cannot prove they are female will be barred from competing in the women’s competition, they will be re-admitted once they have completed the sex change process. ‘If these people can solve their problems through surgery and be in a position to receive the necessary medical qualifications, they will then be able to participate in [women's] football,’ Ahmad Hashemian, head of the Iranian football federation’s medical committee, told IRNA, the state news agency. Controversy: Seven players in the women's pro-league have had their contracts cancelled after gender tests . Football is immensely popular in Iran among both men and women, even though women are not able to attend games between male teams. Seven players have already had their contracts terminated since the Iranian football federation said that clubs were required to establish a player’s gender before signing them. Concerns about the sex of players  first emerged four years ago, it is believed, when one women’s team raised suspicions about the goalkeeper on an opposing team.","Four players on Iran's women's football team were 'not completely female'

"England face Wales in the RBS Six Nations opener in Cardiff on Friday with Stuart Lancaster’s side seeking a championship title or Grand Slam as a precursor to their challenge at the World Cup.

CHRIS FOY: Does it feel like you’re being pitched straight in at the deep end in this Six Nations? CHRIS ROBSHAW: Very much so. It was the same last year away to France. We fell five minutes short of an 80-minute performance which cost us the game and, potentially, a Grand Slam. Going to Wales, after what happened to us there in 2013 (losing 30-3), we have a core group of players who experienced that and I’m sure we’ll be more prepared this time.

FOY: There has been so much focus on that 2013 game - was that one of your worst days as a Test player and how determined are you to banish those ghosts? ROBSHAW: It was. To have a loss like that, the biggest loss (by England) against Wales and that place in the history books is not a nice thing to have on your CV. We found ourselves chasing the game, the crowd were on top of us and they had all the momentum, so the floodgates opened. We want to rectify that and we’ll be ready for everything.

FOY: Jonny, did you find Cardiff one of the toughest places to go as an England player? JONNY WILKINSON: It’s a hell of a place to go. In 2013, England knew Wales would come out firing, but they just couldn’t realise how much. It is impossible to be prepared for how much a community and a country can turn up the pressure. When you have thousands of people sitting together watching rugby, how can it be so different? But it is there. Wales in the Millennium Stadium manages to produce a unique atmosphere. England's players stand under the posts looking despondent during the defeat to Wales in 2012 . Wilkinson speaks and gestures with his hands during the exclusive interview with Sportsmail's Chris Foy . FOY: What makes the England-Wales rivalry so special and intense? ROBSHAW: A lot comes down to how well they have done in recent years. They’ve won Grand Slams and we want those honours for ourselves. In 2013 we probably didn’t know quite what it meant, to go into the heartland of Wales to try to win a Grand Slam. Stuart spoke to us about going into the eye of a storm and that’s what it was. That passion we experienced has really built that rivalry among us players. WILKINSON: What comes to the fore when England play Wales is that they will do anything to defend the pride and honour of their country. That makes it a really physical battle but Wales also have some of that ‘French flair’, too. When we played them in the quarter-final of the World Cup in 2003, I’d never been attacked like that before. They just went for it, and that is what Wales can do to you. Wilkinson kicks a drop goal during an England vs Wales match in the Six Nations . Wilkinson (right) holds on to the ball as the Wales defence attempts to bring him to the ground . FOY: How relevant is this game to the World Cup pool match later in the year? 35 - Jonny Wilkinson holds the Six Nations record for most points scored in a game. The former England fly-half scored 35 in an 80-23 win over Italy in 2003. WILKINSON: You could play this game then play each other again the week after and the result could be very different. When you think like that, eight months is a long time so whoever wins this game won’t necessarily win the next. But it is a huge opportunity to become familiar with the intensity that will be required. ROBSHAW: There is a lot riding on this game, with everything coming up, but eight months is a long time to keep developing - and we will be playing that World Cup game at Twickenham, which is important. I know they kindly offered to stage it in Cardiff but I’m glad it’s going to be here! This trip to the Millennium Stadium will produce a similar amount of pressure as we’ll have to deal with at the World Cup, so this will be useful mental preparation. Robshaw (left) and Wilkinson laugh as they pose for photos for Guinness Rugby . Wilkinson (right) attempts to get past Wales centre Jamie Roberts during a match in February 2010 . FOY: How crucial is it for England to win the Six Nations title or Grand Slam to create momentum? ROBSHAW: After three second-place finishes of course we want to go one better this time, but a lot of the northern-hemisphere teams went well in the autumn and we all want to finish top of the pile in Europe, to give us that extra confidence going into the World Cup. WILKINSON: During my career, there were definitely moments when we cleared major psychological barriers. Beating Australia in 2000 - when we won in the last minute - was one and the Grand Slam in 2003 was another. Even if we hadn’t won it, I still think we were on the right track for the World Cup that year. You want to clear those psychological barriers, but England beat New Zealand in 2012 by a hell of a score and nobody thought, “That’s it, we’ve cracked it”.

Chris Ashton (right) swallow dives over the tryline during England's famous victory over New Zealand in 2012 . FOY: A home World Cup will put huge pressure on the England captain. How will you cope with that, Chris? ROBSHAW: The good thing about it being a home World Cup is that, when you have the occasional day off, you can go home, see loved ones and escape the rugby bubble. We’re not quite sure about the magnitude of it yet, but escaping the pressure is all about surrounding yourself with the right people and switching off when you can. You have to be focused on the job, but it is important from that mental side to have a down day now and again.

FOY: Jonny, how do you assess the progress Chris has made as a player and as England captain? WILKINSON: When I first came into the England squad, I felt like a rabbit in the headlights but Chris seemed to fit in straightaway. He is full of respect and good values, but when he’s out on the field you give him a job and he does it right every time. He just gets on with things without making a big song and dance. He has grown and grown, and shown his strength of character so many times. What you want your captain to do is make good choices, do the right things and lead by example. Chris does all that and he’s a nice bloke, so playing against him must be so difficult. He has respect and his players will see that, which means that they will follow him. Robshaw (centre) reacts to a decision during England's victory over Australia in November . FOY: George Ford has emerged as England’s first-choice fly-half, and Owen Farrell is injured. Jonny, how do you rate the young playmaker who will wear No 10 and the other, who will be missed? WILKINSON: George Ford is a fabulous player who produces some amazing touches and is a natural in the way he reads the game. He works hard and as a young guy he is happy to take on responsibility and shows he can deal with it. Owen Farrell is immensely tough mentally and deserves a hell of a lot more credit than he has been getting for what he has done in the last few years. As a young guy, he has dealt with pressure, kicked goals and stood up in defence. He came in without much experience but just got on with it. England are lucky to have both those guys.

Wilkinson (left) and Sportsmail columnist Sir Clive Woodward embrace in 2003 . FOY: Chris, which teams are the main threats to your title ambitions in this Six Nations? ROBSHAW: I don’t think we can look much further than that first game in Wales, but Scotland are also playing well and Ireland were probably the form team coming out of the autumn. There won’t be any easy games - that’s why it’s a great tournament.

"Tottenham have made a last minute bid to land MK Dons wonderkid Dele Alli. Newcastle and Aston Villa both have offers in for the 18-year-old midfielder - but Mauricio Pochettino wants to steal the youngster from under their noses. Sportsmail revealed last week how Villa launched a bid to rival Newcastle in the race for Alli. Tottenham have made a late charge to steal MK Dons wonderkid Dele Alli from under Newcastle's noses .

"Iraqi authorities are detaining thousands of women illegally and subjecting many to torture because of crimes they allege their husbands committed, a Human Rights Watch report has claimed. Many women were detained for months or even years without charge while security forces questioned them about their male relatives' activities rather than crimes in which they themselves were implicated, HRW says. In custody, women described being kicked, slapped, hung upside-down, beaten on the soles of their feet, given electric shocks, threatened with sexual assault by security forces during interrogation, and even raped in front of their relatives and children. 'The abuses of women we documented . are in many ways at the heart of the current crisis in Iraq,' said HRW's . deputy Middle East and North Africa director Joe Stork in a statement . accompanying the report, titled: 'No One Is Safe: Abuses of Women in . Iraq's Criminal Justice System.' Iraqi authorities have detained thousands of women without charge and subjected them to torture because of crimes their husbands allegedly committed, the Human Rights Watch claims (stock image of two Iraqi women in 2003) Mr . Stark added: 'These abuses have caused a deep-seated anger and lack of . trust between Iraq's diverse communities and security forces, and all . Iraqis are paying the price.' A . spokesman for Iraq's Human Rights Ministry said the testimonies in the . HRW report were 'over-exaggerated', but acknowledged that 'we have some . limited illegal behaviours which were practised by security forces . against women prisoners', which it said had been identified by the . ministry's own teams. These . teams had referred their reports to the relevant authorities, 'asking . them to bring those who are responsible for mistreating female detainees . to justice', the spokesman said. 'Iraq . is still working to put an end to prison abuse and, with more time, . understanding of law and patience, such illegal practices will become a . history,' he said. The . 105-page report is based on interviews with imprisoned Sunni and Shi'ite . women and girls, although Sunnis make up the vast majority of the more . than 4,200 women detained in Interior and Defence Ministry facilities, . HRW said. The release of women detainees was a main demand of Sunnis who began demonstrating late in 2012 against the Shi'ite-led government, which they accuse of marginalising their community. Revelations: The alleged abuses were revealed in the Human Rights Watch report entitled 'No One Is Safe: Abuses Of Women In Iraq's Criminal Justice System' Security forces cleared one of two Sunni protest camps in Anbar province in December 2013. In the ensuing backlash, militants seized the city of Falluja and parts of Ramadi. Since then, more than 1,000 people have been killed across Iraq, according to Iraq Body Count, and the army is preparing for a possible ground assault to retake Falluja. One woman who entered her meeting with HRW at a death row facility in Baghdad on crutches said she had been permanently disabled by abuse, displaying injuries consistent with the mistreatment she alleged. Seven months later, she was executed despite lower court rulings that dismissed charges against her following a medical report that supported her accusations of torture. HRW described Iraq's judiciary as weak and plagued by corruption, with convictions frequently based on coerced confessions, and trial proceedings that fall far short of international standards. If women are released unharmed, they are frequently stigmatised by their family or community, who perceive them to have been dishonoured, HRW said. 'Both men and women suffer from the severe flaws of the criminal justice system. But women suffer a double burden due to their second-class status in Iraqi society,' HRW said.","Alleged abuse is detailed in a new Human Rights Watch report .

"E-cigarettes have been touted as a ‘safer’ alternative for smokers, but a new study indicates that this may not be the case. Sales of e-cigarettes have soared by 340 per cent in the past year as Britons turn to the electronic smoking devices in a bid to quit traditional cigarettes. Now, a study examining the biological effects of e-cigarettes found ‘strikingly similar’ gene mutations in lung cells exposed to e-cig vapour as those found in smokers. Risky puff: Scientists at Boston University, U.S. found 'strikingly similar' gene mutations in lung cells exposed to e-cig vapour as in those exposed to tobacco smoke . Scientists grew bronchial cells in mediums exposed to e-cig vapour and compared them to bronchial cells grown in a medium exposed to tobacco smoke. They found that the gene mutations in both sets of cells, although not identical, showed ‘striking similarities’. ‘[E-cigarettes] may be safer, but our preliminary studies suggest that they may not be benign,’ said study author Avrum Spira, a genomics and lung cancer researcher at Boston University. This means that although e-cigarette vapour is tobacco and tar-free and that the device does not require combustion, it could potentially increase a user’s risk of cancer. Mr Spria, who presented the study’s findings at the American Association of Cancer Research’s annual meeting this week, said he could not confirm or deny that e-cigarettes cause cancer, as the research is in its early stages. Further experiments are planned. Still unknown: The new research means e-cigarettes may be safer than normal tobacco cigarettes, but not as harmless as we first thought . E-cigarettes have soared in popularity in recent years as consumers look for ‘healthier’ ways to continue smoking, rather than use gum or patches to quit the habit. Figures released last month found that while sales of smoking quitting aids have slowed, the market for e-cigarettes is booming. Sales have increased by 340 per cent over the past year, from £44 million in 2012 to reach an estimated £193 million in 2013. The report says that while the smoking cessation market has seen strong growth historically, with annual increases of around 6-10 per cent between 2009-12, sales of products such as gum, tablets and patches have slowed. In 2013 the market for smoking cessation aids grew just 1.7 per cent to reach a value of £131 million.","Electronic cigarettes may not be as safe as first thought .

"German Chancellor Angela Merkel has enlisted a heavyweight companion to fight alongside her in next year's general election - God. A day after scrapping an unpopular medical charge and boosting benefits for stay-at-home mothers, Mrs Merkel has taken a leaf out of Tony Blair's book to declare that she has strong religious beliefs. It is the first time that the former Lutheran minister's daughter, a cool-headed physicist who was raised in former Communist East Germany, has admitted that faith is a vital part of her life. Faith: Angel Merkel (centre) revealed her strong Christian beliefs and said religion was an important part of her life . While cynics claim her declaration is aimed at hard-core conservatives in her Christian Democratic Union party, she said: 'I am a member of the evangelical church. I believe in God and religion is also my constant companion, and has been for the whole of my life.' Mrs Merkel was on answering questions from a theology student on an Internet blog when she revealed her views on religion. She continued: 'We as Christians should above all not be afraid of standing up for our beliefs. 'The structure of the world relating to belief is a framework for my life that I consider very important.' Popularity issue: Some believe Merkel is fishing for votes from Germany's Christian community . Volker Resing, her biographer, said: 'She has realised that her avowal of Christianity is important - as a signal within the secular society, but also to her party members who have often accused her of not being concerned with the C in the party's initials CDU.'

"Alex Salmond was left reeling last night as a new poll revealed a surge in support for the Union amid growing anger over his support for Vladimir Putin. The bruised First Minister gave a woeful display in Holyrood as he was blasted by all three opposition leaders for his glowing comments about the Russian president. At the end of one of the toughest weeks for the SNP leader in recent months - including branding Scotland a 'nation of drunks - a new poll was also published which found that Better Together has recorded a dramatic 16-point lead over the Yes campaign. Among those expressing a preference, 58 per cent said they would vote against Scottish independence, with only 42 backing it in a YouGov poll for Channel 4 News . With undecided voters stripped out from the figures, the YouGov study put support for the Union at 58 per cent, with backing for separation languishing on just 42 per cent. That is a far cry from a recent ICM poll which put Yes on 48 per cent and No on 52 per cent, and suggests any momentum for Mr Salmond’s campaign has come to a shuddering halt. It is also a major humiliation for SNP strategists who privately told journalists they could draw level in the polls as early as this week. However, the importance of persuading pro-Union Scots to cast their votes on September 18 became clear yesterday, as a study found that supporters of independence are far more likely to turn out. Their greater appetite could boost the final Yes tally by 2 per cent, which could be pivotal in a close race. The poll is a devastating blow for Alex Salmond after one of his worst ever weeks . Record numbers of Scots have now registered to vote, including 80 per cent of 16 and 17-year-olds. The new YouGov poll for Channel 4 News involved surveying 1,208 Scots between Friday, April 25, and Monday, April 28. It came at the end of a week when Labour had ‘stamped its mark all over the referendum debate’ with leader Ed Miliband bringing his Shadow Cabinet to Glasgow and former Prime Minister Gordon Brown appearing under the Better Together banner for the first time. Then, on Monday, it emerged Mr Salmond had told GQ magazine that he admires ‘certain aspects’ of Putin’s politics. The Russian president has effectively outlawed homosexuality, defended the Syrian government’s attacks on its own people, and annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea before claiming it for Russia. But, while Mr Salmond said he does not approve of a ‘range of Russian actions’, he added: ‘He’s restored a substantial part of Russian pride and that must be a good thing.’ His comments sparked worldwide condemnation from groups such as Amnesty International, while the SNP leader received unwanted support from the Kremlin and pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk. In the same interview, while discussing promoting whisky when abroad, Mr Salmond said: ‘My argument is that if you are promoting it as authentic and of great worth, you cannot promote it from a nation of drunks.’ Mr Salmond has stubbornly refused to apologise to Ukrainians, and again flatly turned down the opportunity to say sorry during First Minister’s Questions yesterday. Observers agreed that it was one of the worst performances by Mr Salmond in the chamber for months. His front bench looked uncomfortable as Labour leader Johann Lamont told him: ‘The reputation of the people of Scotland has been damaged.’ Mr Salmond's frontbench colleagues appeared uncomfortable during yesterday's First Minister's Questions . Scots families would pay more for mortgages and credit cards in an independent Scotland, an influential ratings agency has warned. Moody’s said separation would leave Scotland at least two notches below the rest of the UK, pushing up the cost of borrowing and leaving people worse off. It has also delivered a hammer blow to Alex Salmond’s hopes of sharing the pound by saying it would be bad for the rest of the UK. However, it admits such an outcome is ‘unlikely’ as the main parties have all ruled out a currency union following a Yes vote. The findings reinforce the gloomy predictions for an independent Scotland previously made by the likes of Fitch and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). Fitch, one of the other top ratings agencies, warned the SNP plans for a ‘currency union’ with the rest of the UK could lead to ‘high volatility and market turbulence’ in December. And earlier this month, NIESR said Scotland’s annual debt repayments to the rest of the UK, including interest, would be a crippling £23billion. First Minister Alex Salmond has said Scotland could walk away from the UK debt if it is not allowed to join a currency union. And Joan MacAlpine, SNP MSP, made the bizarre claim that Scotland’s credit rating would be higher than the UK’s. That was dismissed by Moody’s yesterday. It said: ‘The most likely scenario is that Scotland would be rated somewhere in the middle of investment grade, though at least two notches below the UK's rating. ‘An A rating is the most likely at the outset, but with risks of a different outcome tilted to the downside.' It also backed the UK Government’s decision to rule out sharing the pound following a Yes vote. ‘If Scotland were to retain the pound sterling as its currency and the Bank of England as its central bank, this would be credit negative for the remainder of the UK,’ Moody’s said. The findings were seized upon by the pro-union campaign who said they deal a further blow to the nationalists’ faltering economic case for independence. Alistair Darling, the leader of Better Together, said: ‘This is an absolutely devastating report for the nationalists.' Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish . Liberal Democrats, said: ‘The First Minister wants us to stand tall in . the world, but does he not just look small?’ Ruth Davidson, Scottish Conservative leader, said the First Minister ‘continues to make poorly timed and badly judged interventions on foreign affairs’. She added: ‘How can we trust the First Minister to represent Scotland on the global stage when he so consistently gets it wrong?’ Mr Salmond’s only defence was to weakly refer to a £500,000 donation to Better Together from businessman Ian Taylor last year, and to claim that he was referring to the Sochi Winter Olympics when he spoke of Russian ‘pride’. ‘The position that we have put forward has been consistent and balanced,’ he said. ‘It shows that we do not approve of Russian actions and consists of comments that are reasonable in the circumstances, and we back that up by the action that we have taken.’ Afterwards his top spin doctor bizarrely claimed the criticism was not borne out of concern for the people of Ukraine, or Scotland’s global image, but was part of a Better Together conspiracy. His remarks were reminiscent of Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill’s widely derided claim that criticism of his plan to abolish legal safeguards was also a pro-Union plot. The First Minister’s spokesman said there was a ‘coordinated political attack by opponents sensing an opportunity that has nothing to do with the situation in Ukraine’. Meanwhile, the new YouGov poll was welcomed by Better Together last night. ‘This poll is yet another sign that our campaign speaks for the majority of Scots who want Scotland to remain a proud member of the UK,’ a spokesman said. However, researchers at social research institute ScotCen found that the proportion of Yes voters who are more than 50 per cent likely to take part in the referendum is four percentage points higher than the equivalent proportion for No supporters. Among undecided voters, 91 per cent of those leaning towards Yes are more than 50 per cent likely to vote, compared with 73 per cent leaning towards No. A spokesman for Better Together said: ‘This analysis shows that everyone who believes that we are stronger and better together as part of the UK has to campaign for it and they have to vote for it. This is the biggest decision that we will ever take as a nation. It is too important to leave to other people.’ A Yes Scotland spokesman said: ‘The success of the campaign so far lies in the fact that hundreds of thousands of people have found no difficulty in finding the motivation to fight for a Yes vote.’ The SNP claimed that support for separation is at its highest level in YouGov polls, and business convener Derek Mackay insisted the race is still ‘neck and neck’.","58% say they will vote No, with only 42 backing independence .

"Steve Jobs's tangled family of a forgotten father, long-lost sister and love child means lawyers may face a delicate task breaking up his $8.3billion fortune. The 56-year-old co-founder and former CEO of Apple is widely seen as one of the world's greatest entrepreneurs - and he died just outside the top 100 world’s richest billionaires. But behind the iconic Californian's wealth and fame lies an extraordinary story of a fragmented family. Husband and wife: Steve Jobs leans his forehead against his wife after delivering the keynote address at an Apple conference in San Francisco, California, in June 2011, months before his death . Mr Jobs, of Palo Alto, California, is survived by his sisters Patti Jobs . and Mona Simpson, his wife Laurene Powell Jobs and their three children . Eve, Erin and Reed. But his family is far from straightforward. He was adopted as a baby and, despite his biological father's attempts to contact him later on, remained estranged from his natural parents. In his early twenties Mr Jobs became . embroiled in a family scandal before his days of close media scrutiny, after he fathered a love child with his . high school sweetheart Chrisann Brennan. Ms Brennan, who was his first . serious girlfriend, became pregnant in 1977 - and he at first denied he was the . father. She gave birth to Lisa Brennan-Jobs in 1978 - and in the same year Mr Jobs created the 'Lisa' computer, but insisted it only stood for 'Local Integrated Software Architecture'. The mother initially raised their . daughter on benefits. But he accepted his responsibilities two years later after a . court-ordered blood test proved he was the father, despite his claims of being 'infertile'. Relatives: Mr Jobs did not meet his biological . sister Mona Simpson, left, until he was aged 27. Lisa Brennan-Jobs, . right, was his love child with longtime girlfriend Chrisann Brennan in . 1978 . Ms Brennan-Jobs has made a living for herself, after graduating from Harvard University, as a journalist and writer. 'My father was rich and renowned, and . later, as I got to know him, went on vacations with him, and then lived . with him for a few years, I saw another, more glamorous world' Lisa Brennan-Jobs . She was eventually invited into her . father's life as a teenager and told Vogue . that she 'lived with him for a few years'. 'In . California, my mother had raised me mostly alone,' Lisa wrote in an . article for Vogue in 2008. 'We didn’t have many things, but she is warm . and we were happy. We moved a lot. We rented. 'My . father was rich and renowned, and later, as I got to know him, went on . vacations with him, and then lived with him for a few years, I saw . another, more glamorous world.' Biological dad: Abdulfattah Jandali, 80, a casino boss, has said he wanted to meet his son but was worried about calling him in case Mr Jobs thought he was after money . Mr Jobs was born to Joanne Schieble and Syrian student Abdulfattah Jandali before being given up for adoption. Mr Jandali was a Syrian student and not married to Ms Simpson at the time of Mr Jobs's birth in San Francisco, California, in February 1955. She did not want to bring up a child out of wedlock and went to San Francisco from their home in Wisconsin to have the baby. Mr Jobs is thought never to have made contact with his biological father. Mr Jandali, 80, a casino boss, has said he wanted to meet his son but was worried if Mr Jobs thought he was after money. Tributes: Flowers adorn the sidewalk outside the home of Steve Jobs in Palo Alto, California, today . He had always hoped that his son would call him to make contact - and had emailed him a few times in an attempt to speak. Mr Jandali once said he 'cannot believe' his son created so many gadgets. 'This might sound strange, though, . but I am not prepared, even if either of us was on our deathbeds, to . pick up the phone to call him,' he said. Ms Schieble and Mr Jandali then had a second child called Mona Simpson, who became a novelist. Ms Simpson is an author who once . wrote a book loosely based on her biological brother. She lives in Santa . Monica, California, with her two children and was once married to . producer Richard Appel. Couple: Jobs and his wife Laurene Powell (pictured at the 82nd Annual Academy Awards in March 7, 2010) met in 1989. They have three children together - Eve, Erin and Reed . But . Mr Jobs did not actually meet Ms Simpson until he was aged 27. He never . wanted to explain how he tracked down his sister, but she described . their relationship as 'close'. Mr . Jobs was adopted by working-class couple Clara and Paul Jobs, who have . both since died, but they also later adopted a second child - Patti . Jobs. He later had the Ms Brennan-Jobs love . child with his longtime girlfriend Ms Brennan in 1978. He . met his wife Laurene Powell in 1989 while speaking at Stanford's . graduate business school and he had three children with her - Eve, Erin . and Reed. Residence: Jobs had lived in Palo Alto, California at this sprawling home, estimated to be worth $2.6 million . They married in 1991 and Reed was born soon after. He is their oldest child, aged 20. Mr . Jobs registered an incredible 338 U.S. patents or patent applications . for technology and electronic accessories, reported the International . Business Times. He was believed to have driven a 2007 Mercedes Benz SL55 AMG, which was worth around $130,000 new at the time. His 5,700 sq ft home was a 1930s Tudor-style property with seven bedrooms and four bathrooms - and it is estimated by CNBC to be worth $2.6million. Mr Jobs also owned a huge historic . Spanish colonial home in Woodside, which had 14 bedrooms and 13 . bathrooms, located across six acres of forested land. Namaste: The 56-year-old co-founder and former CEO of Apple is widely seen as one of the world's greatest entrepreneurs . But he later had it knocked down to make way for a smaller property after a long legal battle. His charitable giving has always been a secret topic, just like most other elements of his lifestyle. Mr Jobs reportedly declined to get involved with the Giving Pledge - founded by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates to get the wealthiest people to give away at least half of their wealth. But he is rumoured to have given $150million to the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of California in San Francisco, reported the New York Times. It is cancer organisations that are most likely to be supported if any charities are in his will, as he died on Wednesday at the age of 56 from the pancreatic form of the illness.","Apple co-founder survived by two sisters, wife and their three children .

"A McDonald's worker who picked up the bill for hungry first responders after they battled local fires has returned to work to find she no longer has a job. Heather Levia, a 23-year-old single mother who works two jobs in Olean, New York, said she simply wanted to show her appreciation for two groups of firefighters working in sub-zero temperatures. So when a group of firefighters came into the store, where Levia was working a morning shift as manager last week, and ordered 25 sandwiches, she took $83 from her own wallet to pay for it. 'Just because I appreciate everything they do,' she explained to WIVB. Scroll down for video . Fired: Heather Levia, 23, lost her job after she paid for firefighters' breakfast out of her pocket . But later that morning, another department came in and ordered $70 worth of food. Desperate to treat these emergency responders too, she texted her boss to see if the company would foot the bill, aware that they often bought food for police officers, Levia said. But the boss said that Levia would not be allowed to donate the sandwiches. So Levia tried the corporate offices instead - but she got the same answer. Refusing to let the firefighters pay, she and two workers paid from their own pockets. But some emergency responders called her boss to complain, saying they had made her feel obligated. 'You opened a whole bees' nest,' her boss reportedly told Levia. When she returned the next day, she was fired. Her co-workers who also chipped in for the bill did not lose their jobs. Denial: She had asked her bosses if they donated food, but was told they did not. The company says it did not fire her for paying for the food - but because she swore at a superior, which she denies . Thankful: Allegany Fire Media Officer Gordon Scott said he was shocked to hear Levia had been fired . Her boss claimed she had sworn at a superior, but Levia, who has worked for the company for eight years and is putting herself through nursing school, said that's not true. 'I did say this is ""freaking"" ridiculous,' she admitted. 'But it was not implied to anybody.' Tom Meyers, the owner of the Olean McDonald's said the company was an 'ardent supporter' of local first responders. 'We . are aware that certain allegations have been made concerning the . reasons for Heather Levia’s termination,' he said. 'Out of respect for . Ms. Levia and her privacy, it would not be appropriate to comment in . detail on the reasons she is no longer employed by our organization. 'Still, . it should be pointed out that the allegations are absolutely not true. We would never penalize an employee for showing appropriate gratitude . for the work of our firefighters.' Generous: Levia is a single mother to twin girls but said she has already had other job offers . Allegany firefighters said they were saddened to hear Levia had been fired. 'It was a shock,' said Allegany Fire Media Officer Gordon Scott. 'It was a sad affair because a gentleman lost a home [in the fire]. And it's even worse because we know now that this gal apparently lost her job because of it.' Levia, mother to two young twin girls, said she is putting the ordeal behind her and has already received several job offers after her story gained local press. She added: 'I wish the communities . would change and help each other out... And if losing my job is going to . speak out to the community, then that’s what it’s going to do.'
