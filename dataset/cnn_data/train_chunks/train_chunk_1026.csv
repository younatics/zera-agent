'Wayne’s peak may have been a lot younger than what we’d . expect of footballers traditionally. Age 28 or 29 has been the normal . ""peak"".

"Nervous: Michelle Mone is one of the Scottish ultra-rich who could move if the country leaves the UK . A vote for Scottish independence could see the country's millionaires flee to England, with one in seven of ultra-rich Scots likely to leave, according to a report released today. Experts warn of uncertainty over the tax regime and financial stability in an independent Scotland, which could push the rich out of the country in the event of a Yes vote in Thursday's referendum. In addition, many of Scotland's wealthiest people run businesses based south of the border, meaning they are more likely to move to England if their fellow voters opt to leave the UK. One example is Michelle Mone, founder of bra firm Ultimo, who has vowed to move her company headquarters to England if the Union breaks up and claims to be 'very very scared' at the prospect of independence. The revelations came in a report compiled by Spear's magazine and consultancy firm WealthInsight on the possible impact of a Yes vote on the 22,000 millionaires who live in Scotland. Around 15 per cent of the wealthiest Scots, with a total net worth of £8billion, have their primary business in England, according to the data. The report claims that these people are particularly likely to leave Scotland because of the difficulties of being based in a different country to their companies. In addition, the uncertainty about issues such as the currency and future tax rates are set to prompt millionaires to seek the security of the UK, the report suggests. Josh Spero, editor of Spear’s, said: 'If there’s one thing the wealthy – or indeed most people – hate, it’s uncertainty, not least over the laws and taxes which govern them. 'In the long, obscure and painful period between a Yes vote and eventual independence, wealthy Scots – and particularly those with business interests in England – might well hop the border to England, with its long-settled, reasonably advantageous tax system. 'That’s even before we learn what the Scottish rates of tax would be, which would almost certainly be higher to pay for generous health, education and welfare provision.' Scroll down for video . Passion: But some business leaders have warned against voting for Scotland to become independent . Response: No supporters insist that the Union is vital to protect Scotland's financial future . Oliver Williams of WealthInsight added: 'While Scotland has long been a hotbed of entrepreneurship, these statistics show that a large proportion of its wealthiest entrepreneurs have benefitted from cross-border business. 'A Yes vote would therefore not only be hostile to many within Scotland’s wealthy community, but could affect the fortunes of its future entrepreneurs. 'A newly independent Scotland would put many wealthy business owners in an awkward position where they no longer live in the same country as their company. Millionaires across Scotland may suddenly have to choose in which country to declare their domicile and where to keep their millions.' Estate agents have warned that the uncertainty caused by Scottish independence would be devastating for the high-end property market - one said yesterday that £5million worth of deals would fall through in the event of a Yes vote on Thursday. Clash: Gordon Brown is in Glasgow today attempting to combat the arguments of Alex Salmond . A City law firm warned today that investors would shy away from putting money into Scottish infrastructure projects if the country voted for independence, because public-private partnerships would no longer be backed by the British Government. RPC said: 'For some time foreign investors have been delaying investments in PPP projects in Scotland because they are worried about having the implied guarantee of the UK Government replaced with the much smaller and potentially weaker Scottish balance sheets. 'Delays in getting investments from overseas investors into Scottish infrastructure projects are only going to get longer if Scotland decides to vote ""yes"".' A string of high-profile businesses and entrepreneurs, from BP to Sir Richard Branson, have warned of the economic instability from which an independent Scotland could suffer. However, the Yes campaign insists that Scotland would be one of the world's wealthiest countries, and claims the support of 3,000 Scottish businessmen.","Report by consultancy suggests 15% of ultra-rich could leave Scotland .

"Rory McIlroy picked up seven birdies and two eagles to storm to the top of the leaderboard on the first day of Jack Nicklaus' Memorial Tournament in Ohio. But the Northern Irishman, who put the distress caused by his publicised break-up with tennis . player Caroline Wozniacki to one side last weekend to win the BMW PGA Championship on Sunday, might have been five strokes clear of the field had he not spoiled his remarkable run over the back nine with a double bogey on the par-four 14th hole. Rory McIlroy hits from a bunker on the 14th hole during the first round in Dublin, Ohio . He rallied to card an impressive nine-under 63, while England's Paul Casey shot a six-under 66 earlier on Thursday to take a share of second place with Americans Bubba Watson and Chris Kirk. It was the lowest opening round in 39 years at the Memorial. 'I don't think it's anything more than just being confident with my game,' McIlroy said. 'I was expecting this to happen. I've been playing well. I've been posting good numbers, good rounds. And I knew my game was close. And honestly, I don't think it's anything to do with what's happening off the golf course. It's just I've been trending in the right direction, and it's starting to all come together.' Injury scare: Rory McIlroy tweaked his knee hitting an approach to the seventh . In the swing: McIlroy hits his second shot on the fifth hole at Muirfield Village . His only . scare came on the seventh hole when his spikes caught and applied a . little more torque on his knee. McIlroy said he had never experienced . that before, but he thought some ice and work in the fitness trailer . should take care of it. 'The inside of it is sore, a little swollen,' McIlroy said. 'Some treatment and I should be fine for the morning.' McIlroy clinched a surprise . victory at Wentworth and that winning momentum followed him to Muirfield . Village. Birdies on the second, fourth and seventh holes followed a run . of two birdies and an eagle over the turn before he picked up a sixth . shot on 13. Focus: McIlroy has put the distress of his break-up with Caroline Wozniack to one side . At eight under he was two strokes clear of the three men who had . already carded 66, but briefly joined Casey and the American duo in a . tie for the lead after finding the rear bunker on 14 and needing a total . of six shots to hole out. McIlroy remedied that situation immediately by draining a 15-foot putt to claim his second eagle of the day before adding one final birdie on the 16th. Casey, currently 97th in the official world rankings, started with a bogey but reached the turn four under having drained an eagle on the par-five seventh.

"One Spanish king may have abdicated but Rafael Nadal looks determined to hang onto his crown as the king of clay. The world No 1 maintained his record of not having dropped a set at this year's French Open with a 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 victory over Serb Dusan Lajovic in the fourth round. Lajovic, 23, was playing in only his second grand slam tournament and it was certainly a baptism of fire for his first match on Court Philippe Chatrier. In his reach: Rafael Nadal is only three matches away from winning a ninth French Open men's singles title . Nadal, on the day when King Juan Carlos of Spain announced he was abdicating after 39 years on the throne, won the first five games before Lajovic finally got on the board. His start to the second set was even worse, Nadal winning the first 17 points, although Lajovic then managed to hold two successive service games. He had three chances to break the Nadal serve and make it 5-3 but the eight-time champion, watched by singer Prince, fought back. Demolition job: Rafael Nadal cruises into the quarter-finals after a convincing win over Serbian Dusan Lajovic . Lajovic managed a final hurrah by breaking the Spaniard's serve at 0-5 in the third set but Nadal, who has lost just 23 games in four matches, promptly broke again to love to clinch victory in a sprightly hour and 33 minutes. Nadal revealed after his previous match against Leonardo Mayer that he was again feeling the back problem that so badly affected him in the Australian Open final against Stan Wawrinka. It clearly has not hampered his progress so far but the draw has been kind and he will face his first real test in the quarter-finals against compatriot David Ferrer. Down and out: Dusan Lajovic was beaten soundly by Rafael Nadal in the fourth round of the French Open . Second best: Lajovic hadn't dropped a set all tournament but was beaten comprehensively by Nadal today . In the audience: Prince made a rare public appearance to watch Rafael Nadal . The fifth seed, who Nadal beat in the . final 12 months ago, lost his first set of the tournament against Kevin . Anderson on Sunday but was nevertheless an impressive 6-3 6-3 6-7 (5/7) 6-1 winner. Ferrer was well beaten last year but this match, his 10th consecutive grand slam quarter-final, will have an extra edge because of the outcome of their last meeting. In Monte Carlo in April, Ferrer beat Nadal on clay for the first time in 10 years, one of three defeats the world number one has suffered in the build-up to Roland Garros. Easy does it: Rafael Nadal complained of back pain at the weekend but moved freely today against Lajovic . Big future: Dusan Lajovic has enjoyed a good run competing in only his second ever Grand Slam main draw .","Nadal takes just one hour and 33 minutes to win 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 .

"Forget coffee, bananas and bio-diversity, for millions of English football fans it was Paulo Wanchope who put Costa Rica on the map. He collected the ball inside his own half, galloped towards the Stretford End with Phil Neville trailing in pursuit, ate up 60 yards and casually rolled the ball past Peter Schmeichel to put Derby two up at Manchester United. It was Wanchope’s debut in April 1997 and Derby won the game 3-2. Old Trafford was stunned and a nation reached for its atlases. Within a few months, he was shooting the breeze with the Queen as he began a decade of global adventure featuring London, Manchester and Spain, Qatar, Argentina, Japan and the United States. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Paulo Wanchope's goal for Derby at Manchester United . Dream debut: Wanchope celebrates after scoring at Manchester United on his Derby debut in April 1997 . A star is born: Wanchope (second left) in action for Derby against Arsenal at Pride Park in November 1997 . Paulo bursting with Pride: Wanchope celebrates scoring in that 1997 match against Arsenal . These days Wanchope is back home, as assistant manager of the Costa Rica team, plotting a World Cup strategy for the tiny republic of 4.5million people grouped in a World Cup with England, Italy and Uruguay. ‘It was quite shocking when we saw the draw,’ he said. ‘We knew it would be hard but we have three former champions. It is big for us but we love the challenge. ‘Our country will stop. Everyone will watch the games against England and Italy. Everyone is waiting for that moment.’ Wanchope is lean and athletic and looks much as he did 17 years ago even if the knees ache a little more after six operations, as he reflects on the chain reaction which followed his move to England. ‘It changed my life,’ said Wanchope. ‘I look back on my favourite memories like the United game and when we moved to Pride Park, the friendly we played against Barcelona. I met the Queen when she opened the stadium. They told me the Royal Family had been to Costa Rica.’ Plotting: Wanchope will try to prepare Costa Rica for matches against Uruguay, Italy and England . Suits you: Wanchope is now assistant manager of Costa Rica, who play England on June 24 . On the touchline: Wanchope is now preparing for the World Cup as Costa Rica's assistant manager . The story started when he was invited for a trial at QPR. ‘I came over for two weeks when Stewart Houston was the manager,’ he said. ‘I was in a hotel the whole time and that was difficult for me. I made six goals but still no contract. I went back to Costa Rica and came back to Derby a few months later. ‘I didn’t know where Derby was, except it was up north from London. We drove from Heathrow. When I first saw the Baseball Ground — I was expecting something else. But I knew they were going to move to a new stadium. ‘The atmosphere at the club was amazing. Jim Smith was in charge and Steve McClaren was his assistant. Jim was a character, he was crazy, throwing things everywhere. Tea cups, everything went flying in the dressing room. ‘I spoke good English because I’d been in the States. I’d always played football — and I played table tennis for my country — but at High School, from 14, I started playing basketball and gained a scholarship in America from 17 until 19. ‘Everyone was saying “In Costa Rica, what do they play? Is it football or basketball or baseball?” It’s different now. Everyone remembers my goal against United. We’re crazy about football in Costa Rica. It is the biggest sport.’ Derby recorded two top 10 finishes before Wanchope left for West Ham and Manchester City and then his world tour with Malaga, Al-Gharafa, FC Tokyo, Rosario Central, Chicago Fire. He won his 73rd and final cap for Costa Rica in January 2008, having scored 45 international goals and his next move was to buy a club called Club Sport Uruguay, based in the capital San Jose and playing in the second tier. ‘We got the promotion and then I got the call from the FA to work with the national team,’ said Wanchope. ‘I am gaining experience and maybe I’ll have the chance to come over to England and coach. I would like to be a No 1.’ VIDEO: Wanchope's debut goal for Derby at Old Trafford . International: Wanchope (centre) runs with the ball as Costa Rica take on Germany at the 2006 World Cup . Costa Rica boss is Colombian Jorge Luis Pinto, a big fan of Jose Mourinho, who will take inspiration from the performances of Los Ticos in Italia ‘90, when they beat Scotland and Sweden before losing 1-0 to Brazil and going out in the next round against Czechoslovakia. ‘We want to emulate that,’ said Wanchope. ‘I can remember watching that on television. There were parties in the streets, everywhere. ‘The world will expect two of England, Italy and Uruguay to get through... but we want to get into the second stage.’ Costa Rica start the World Cup against Uruguay and face England in Belo Horizonte on June 24. They have been preparing in Colorado and Florida. ‘The most difficult thing will be the temperature,’ added Wanchope. ‘It will be harder for European teams but it will be tough for us. ‘Tactically, we have improved. The coach likes the Italian style. We are a very organised team, difficult to beat. With players like Bryan Ruiz and Joel Campbell, we can always score.’ Eye on the ball: Costa Rica's Bryan Ruiz (right) controls the ball next to team-mate Roy Miller during training . Hope rests heavily on Ruiz and Campbell, familiar names to English fans. Ruiz is still a Fulham player, although he spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV Eindhoven after fans at Craven Cottage turned against him. ‘It was a good move for the national team,’ said Wanchope. ‘The physical aspect in the Premier League has been tough for him but his confidence is coming back.’ Campbell is an Arsenal striker, who has been out on loan in France, Spain and, last season, in Greece, where he scored for Olympiakos  in the Champions League against Manchester United triggering happy memories in Costa Rica. ‘I had a few calls from  England,’ smiled Wanchope. ‘That was special for him. He knows he needs to improve but I’m sure he’ll do well.’ Preparations: Joel Campbell takes part in a training session in San Jose on Friday ahead of the World Cup .","Wanchope is the assistant manager of Costa Rica as they prepare for the World Cup .

"Her sexually provocative dance moves and pop star lifestyle may not endear her to parents. But Beyoncé’s ‘bling-a-ding’ image makes her great role model for young girls, the employment minister has argued. Former GMTV presenter Esther McVey, who was promoted to the Cabinet in July, has praised the pop star for making a success of her career. Admiration: Employment minister Esther McVey (left) says singer Beyoncé is a good role model for young girls and has praised the singer (right) for making a success of her career . She told the Sunday Times: ‘What I like to see is people like Beyoncé. Here is a woman who is bling-a-ding. Not only does she look like that and act like that — I’ve seen her perform and I was blown away — but she is at the top of her profession.’ Beyoncé, 33, shot to fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of R&B group Destiny’s Child. Since then she has had a lucrative solo career that has made her and her rapper husband Jay Z the highest-earning celebrity couple in the world, with profits of £59million last year. But despite being mother to a two-year-old daughter Blue Ivy, the American star has been accused of setting children a bad example. Mother: Beyoncé and her husband Jay Z are the highest-earning celebrity couple in the world, with profits of £59million last year, and are parents to two-year-old  Blue Ivy.

In 2010, a perfume advert featuring her was banned from being shown before the watershed because it was ‘too sexually provocative’. The Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) said it received 14 complaints that the advert was offensive and unsuitable for broadcast when children might be watching. Miss McVey said she has no shame about her own colourful past which includes a saucy photo-shoot in 1999 when she was launching her TV career. She insisted: ‘I’m not embarrassed. That is part of my life, part of my journey in life. I’ve worked in business, in TV, in construction. They’ve all made me the person I am.’ No regrets: Miss McVey, pictured on the GMTV couch in 1999, said she has no shame about her own colourful past which includes a saucy photo-shoot when she was launching her TV career .

Earlier this year, the Tory MP revealed that despite ‘loving’ children she has not met the right person to have them with. In her latest interview, she said: ‘It wasn’t a sacrifice for work. I never got married, but it wasn’t a decision, it just didn’t happen. I wanted to have children, but it didn’t happen. ‘Then, the older I got, the less important it became for me.’ Asked if she thought she still may have children, the 47-year-old added: ‘It’s not looking promising.’ During the interview Miss McVey revealed her role model was fellow Liverpudlian Rose Heilbron, the first woman QC. She also named other high fliers including Eileen Collins, the first female astronaut to command a space shuttle, Debbie Moore, the chief executive of Pineapple and the first woman to set up a PLC, and Clara Furse who is the first CEO of the London Stock Exchange. Other women Miss McVey admires include young scientist of the year Emily Cummins, war correspondent Christina Lamb and Olympic gymnast Beth Tweddle.","Former GMTV presenter says Beyoncé is 'at the top of her profession'

"An outraged waitress broke a man’s nose in a gay club after she heard him jokingly call his friend ‘queer’. Katie Kenyon, 22, had been on a night out at The Factory in Stoke-On-Trent, Staffordshire, when she overheard the comment. She had been in the smoking area of the club with her gay friend Joshua Halm, 21, when they heard the man greet another by saying ‘Aye up, me queer’. Katie Kenyon, 22, became outraged after hearing a man use the word 'queer' in a nightclub and assaulted him . They then became involved in a heated argument on the club’s roof terrace when Kenyon hit in the man so hard she broke his nose. She escaped a prison sentence after admitting the assault on July 13 when she appeared at North Staffordshire Justice Centre yesterday. Magistrates described it as a ‘serious and unpleasant incident’ and she was told to pay £1,500 in compensation to the injured man. Abigail Hall, prosecuting, told the court: ‘After she heard the comment the defendant said, “Who do you think you are?” ‘The man stated it was a joke and he didn’t mean any offence. ‘The defendant then pulled her hand back and hit him in the nose, knocking him backwards. ‘His nose began bleeding heavily. He was in shock. ‘He was given tissues and was seen by paramedics, who managed to straighten his broken nose.’ Kenyon, pictured left and right with friends, was out with her gay friend and said they were offended by word . Ms Hall said that using the term ‘queer’ was a ‘well-known and accepted welcome to people who frequent that club’. She noted that the person the man had greeted that night did not take any offence to the word himself. Kenyon, from Crewe, Cheshire was arrested and interviewed by police, who she told she had been drinking before the incident. Nick Ryles, defending, said of Kenyon, who is straight: ‘She accepts she lashed out and caught him in the face. ‘It was a backhanded slap and then she walked away. ‘There was a degree of provocation by this gentleman’s attitude and language.’ Kenyon was on a nightout with a friend at the Factory nightclub in Stoke-on-Trent when the incident happened . Speaking after the case Kenyon, who admitted she was not remorseful, said: ‘I will be appealing the decision. I think the punishment was a bit extreme considering how much he provoked me. ‘His comments were homophobic. He was not a gay man and my gay friend took offence as would many people in a gay bar. ‘I should have walked away and I know what I did was wrong but I was just sticking up for one of my friends because I thought his behaviour was disgusting.’ Magistrates gave her a 12 month community sentence and ordered her to undertake 140 hours of unpaid work. She must additionally pay £85 in costs and a £60 victim surcharge. She appeared at North Staffordshire Magistrates Court yesterday where she admitted assault and was ordered to pay £1,500 in compensation to the man .","Katie Kenyon, 22, was on a night out with gay friend in Stoke-On-Trent .

"As Joe Biden and Paul Ryan tore into each other over chewy topics like Iran and tax during last night's TV debate, there was only one subject preoccupying tens of thousands of viewers - the Vice President's glaring toothy grin. Within minutes of the debate starting, Twitter was abuzz with users taken aback by Biden's behaviour and sent out mocking messages. One parodied his a trademark soundbite: 'For those brief moments you don't see a #BidenSmirk on my face, know that I've got a #BidenSmirk in my heart.' Scroll down for video . Hilarity: Joe Biden smirked his way through the vice-presidential debate in Danville, Kentucky . Mocking: Biden was repeatedly seen laughing at what he considered his opponent's missteps . One mischievous feed, 'LaughinJoeBiden', simply tweeted a series of messages reading 'lol', 'lmao' and 'teeheehehe'. While his smile was dismissed as patronising Ryan, his teeth could have been part of a shock and awe tactic on his opponent. Catrise Austin, a 'dentist to the stars' based in New York City, told MailOnline she thought Biden had been fitted with either a full set of porcelain veneers or a porcelain bridge, at an estimated cost of around $20,000. GOP operatives used the Twitter hashtag '#BidenUnhinged' to mock the Vice President's exuberant performance. The Republican National Committee posted an online campaign ad overnight featuring a full minute of him laughing followed by the message, 'Vice President Biden is laughing... are you?' Untamed: Moderator Martha Raddatz could not curb the Vice President's nonstop amusement . Finger-wagging: Some found Biden's unusual mannerisms off-putting and disrespectful . No knockout: Paul Ryan managed to survive Biden's attacks despite his mocking tone . Some compared Biden's laughter to Al Gore's notorious sighs in the 2000 presidential debates, a mannerism which many voters felt made him look unprofessional. 'That condescending, smirking, laughing - it was akin to Gore's sigh,' Republican strategist Mary Matalin told CNN. Ari Fleischer, former press secretary for George W. Bush, tweeted: 'Biden is at risk of having his laugh come across like Gore's sighs. He should knock it off.' Still smiling: Biden grins as he meets his rival's wife, Janna Ryan . Meme me: Inevitably internet jokers decided to add their own interpretations to the reason behind the smirk . Malarkey: This one pokes fun at Biden's most memorable quote during the debate . Fool: Biden annoyed many for constantly interrupting Ryan while others quoted the Bible to mock the VP . Even some Democratic supporters . criticised the behaviour, such as liberal film critic Roger Ebert, who . tweeted: 'Joe! Stop smiling and laughing!' But other Biden fans were pleased with their man's performance - strategist Hillary Rosen said, 'I think he genuinely thought that Ryan’s attempts to nitpick and cast aspersions on the administration’s foreign policy was laughable.' Body language experts were unimpressed by the grinning. Lillian Glass, author of an upcoming book on the practice, said: 'That mugging, those condescending looks - it was a complete turnoff. He was bullying, he was smug, he interrupted... I think he lost a lot of his message based on facial gestures.'

"Paul Scholes said England should try and copy Liverpool’s system, but the difference with Liverpool is they always have short passing options in midfield. On Friday night in the first half there was too big a gap between Steven Gerrard, Jordan Henderson and the front four. If you have two midfielders sitting then you need five or 10-yard passing options in front of them to move the ball quickly. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Gerrard talk about Sturridge's 'magical' goal . Leading by example: England captain Steven Gerrard has a shot on goal during the friendly against Peru . No holding back: England's Jordan Henderson (right) battles for the ball with Peru's Andre Carrillo . Gerrard sat deep, as his touch map below shows, but Henderson did not bomb forward as often as he does for his club. There were moments of quality — Daniel Sturridge’s goal was outstanding — and things improved in the second half but there were too many straight, long passes. England looked much better when there were more short options. GET THE FULL BACKS FLYING . If England want to play wide midfielders that cut inside, then it’s vital Leighton Baines and Glen Johnson get further forward to provide numbers higher up. Without an overlap it’s easy for opposition defenders to stick with their man and crowd out attacks. The full backs need to give that width quickly, and Roy will hope that Baines stays fighting fit for Brazil. Flying down the wing: England full-backs Glen Johnson (left) and Leighton Baines need to get further forward . England have now won their last seven friendlies before a major tournament . THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME? The side Roy Hodgson went with on Friday night could well be the team that ends up starting against Italy in Manaus. In my experience, managers tend to pick their first XI in the first warm-up match and then use the rest of the squad in the later friendly games. Often they then revert to that first side for the tournament opener. It happened in 1998 and again in 2002.  If Roy follows suit, don’t be surprised if the 4-2-3-1 side that started last night starts against Italy. Pensive: England manager Roy Hodgson looks on as he watches his side beat Peru 3-0 . STARTING STERLING IS ROY'S NEXT BIG TASK . Taking Luke Shaw over Ashley Cole was Roy’s biggest selection decision so far, but now he faces another one. How can he fit Raheem Sterling into his starting line-up? The front four did not quite click. When Rooney drops deep he needs options but there were not enough for him on Friday night. Sterling might be used as a substitute for a tiring Rooney but the way he finished the season means he has to be a contender to start. He is such a slippery dribbler and when he came on he made things happen. Darting through: Raheem Sterling goes between Alberto Rodriguez (left) and Alexander Callens (right)","England looked much better when there were more short options .

"A man suspected of killing two deputies during a shooting rampage in Northern California was deported twice to Mexico and had a drug conviction, federal authorities said Saturday. The suspected shooter told Sacramento County Sheriff's investigators that he was 34-year-old Marcelo Marquez of Salt Lake City. However, his fingerprints match the biometric records of a Luis Enrique Monroy-Bracamonte in a federal database, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice said. Monroy-Bracamonte was first removed from the country in 1997 after being convicted in Arizona for possession of narcotics for sale. Monroy-Bracamonte was arrested and sent packing to Mexico a second time in 2001, Kice said. Victims: Michael Davis Jr., 42 (left), was a 15-year veteran sheriff's deputy. Deputy Danny Oliver, the first officer to be shot, was a father . Shooter: Marcelo Marquez, 34, of Salt Lake City, fled police but was eventually flushed out of a home he hid in for several hours using gas bombs. He and a female companion are now in custody . 'The fingerprints were the basis for our request for an immigration detainer,' she said. The detainer requests that local authorities turn him over to federal custody after his case is adjudicated so ICE can purse his deportation, Kice said. The suspect was being held without bail on suspicion of two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and two counts of carjacking. His wife, 38-year-old Janelle Marquez Monroy, was also in custody on suspicion of attempted murder and carjacking after the attack on Friday that left two deputies dead and two other victims wounded. Investigators spent Saturday at the multiple crime scenes 'trying to kind of sort through the chaos so we can methodically rebuild this,' Placer County Sheriff Ed Bonner said. The two suspects were questioned for hours as authorities sought a motive for the shootings that began when Sacramento County sheriff's Deputy Danny Oliver, 47, was shot in the forehead with an assault rifle at close range as he checked out a suspicious car in a motel parking lot. The suspects have talked to investigators, Bonner said, but what sparked the shootings remained unclear. '""Why,"" I guess, will remain a question for a long time,' he said. 'Why was his reaction so violent?' It was also unclear what brought the heavily armed suspects from Utah to California, Bonner said. There were no indications they had been sought by authorities. High alert:  Law enforcement officers stop to search cars as they left the area in response to an officer involved shooting on Friday, October 24, 2014 . Scene: Law enforcement officers in Auburn, Calif., in response to a shooting on Friday. Another officer was shot 30 miles away in Sacramento .

A pair of Placer County deputy sheriffs embrace after the suspect was arrested (left) while another assesses a bullet cartridge left at one of the scenes . A veteran sheriff's deputy and father-of-four who was one of two officers gunned down in a shooting rampage that spanned 30 miles across California on Friday died exactly 26 years to the day that his own father was killed in the line of duty. Michael Davis Jr., 42, was shot dead by a male and female couple who were on the run from killing another deputy in Sacramento earlier in the day. His death tragically mimicked that of his father, Michael Davis Sr., who was killed on the job on the same day in 1988. The incident started about 10.30am in the parking lot of the Motel 6 in Sacramento. Sacramento County Deputy Danny Oliver, 47, approached a suspicious-looking car, but the occupants immediately opened fire. He was shot in the forehead with an assault rifle at close range and did not have time to draw his weapon. He died in the hospital. Oliver, a 15-year veteran of the department, was the first Sacramento County deputy killed since 2008. He left a wife and two daughters. After Oliver was shot, his partner fired at the attackers, who drove about a mile before attempting a carjacking. The attackers then stole a red Ford pickup from a gardener and fled to the Sierra Nevada foothills city of Auburn in neighboring Placer County, about 30 miles northeast of Sacramento. Scene: Officer Oliver was shot dead in the car park of Hotel 66 in Sacramento (pictured) Unprovoked: The suspects immediately opened fire, police said . That is when officer Michael Davis Jr. and his partner spotted the car parked alongside the road. Both were shot with an AR-15-type assault weapon, Placer County sheriff's spokeswoman Dena Erwin said. Davis, who had been working in law enforcement since 1996 - the last 10 years a homicide investigator - died from his injuries. His partner Jeff Davis - no relation - a 17-year department veteran, was treated for a gunshot wound in the arm. Police suspect the shooter was 34-year-old Marcelo Marquez of Salt Lake City, who was being held on suspicion of two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and two counts of carjacking. A woman with him, 38-year-old Janelle Marquez Monroy, was in custody on suspicion of attempted murder and two counts of carjacking. Monroy was arrested at the scene where Davis was killed. Police found a handgun in her purse. Deputies finally used tear gas to flush Marquez from the basement of the home where he hid for several hours.

"There was a time, in the weeks that  followed Daniel Agger's crunching tackle on Jack Wilshere at Wembley in March, when the Arsenal midfielder got really worried. He had broken a bone in his foot and England head coach Roy Hodgson was just weeks away from announcing his squad for this  summer's World Cup in Brazil. The clock was ticking. 'Unfortunately I have been in that position a lot,' admitted Wilshere, reflecting on his bad break during England v Denmark, as he rested between Tuesday's double training session at St George's Park. Eyes on the ball: Jack Wilshere is looking forward to his first World Cup . Club class: Wilshere says that Arsene Wenger helped him by telling him to relex . Come in No 7: Jack Wilshere has been given the iconic England shirt (left) worn by David Beckham and Bryan Robson after Wayne Rooney (top), Frank Lampard (middle) and Steven Gerrard (bottom) had first pick . It was then that Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger came to his rescue, telling him to relax, be patient and he would go to the World Cup. 'I spoke to him because I came back into training and I was panicking a bit about the squad,' revealed Wilshere. 'I wanted to be in it. I went to him and said, “I think I'm ready”, and he said, “No, you're not, you need to train if you are going to have a good World Cup”. I knew I would be fit, but it was just down to whether the manager thought I was ready and whether I felt ready myself as well. 'I knew as well that a bone would take six weeks (to heal). I thought I would be here, but it is down to the manager and I have to thank him for that.' Feel the pain: Wilshere goes down under the challenge of Daniel Agger earlier in the season . End of the world: Wilshire lies in pain on the Wembley turf after the tackle . Jack Wilshere has a chequered history when it comes to injuries and has suffered in the past from sometimes playing too much, too soon. DECEMBER 2009Wilshere injured his ankle in October and was out for five weeks before returning for the festive fixtures. He managed only three games before tweaking a hamstring and missing another month. OCTOBER 2012After missing the whole of the 2011-12 season with ankle and knee problems, Wilshere returned in October and made 28 appearances before injuring his ankle in March and sitting out another five weeks. MAY 2014Wilshere broke his foot playing for England in March and spent nine weeks on the sidelines. Despite missing key games against Chelsea and Man City, Arsene Wenger eased Wilshere back into the side — the midfielder made just two substitute appearances at the end of the season. 52.9% Since coming back from his loan spell at Bolton in 2010, Wilshere has only been able to play in just over half of Arsenal’s games. 454 Days that Wilshere spent out after injuring his ankle in 2011. He missed a total of 66 games for Arsenal. So it was Wenger, a Frenchman who has no specific responsibility for the welfare of the national team, who saved Wilshere's World Cup dream. It is quite a gesture by  Arsenal's manager. Wilshere returned to the Arsenal side towards the end of the season, coming off the bench to play a part in their remarkable comeback in the FA Cup final against Hull. 'It's nice to get the first one (medal),' he admitted. As a kid growing up in Stevenage he visualised another trophy, one with even more significance than the FA Cup. 'When I was a youngster...you want to be part of that, you can only imagine what it would mean to the fans back home if we won the World Cup. That's what we will try to do. Hopefully we can create something special. I have thought about it, especially after winning the FA Cup, you saw what that meant to the Arsenal fans.' Wilshere's eyes light up when he recalls . watching his first World Cup in 1998 — 'Owen's goal... Batty's penalty' — . when England went out to Argentina in a shootout. He laughs . when he is told that Luke Shaw cannot quite recall whether 2006 or 2010 . was the first World Cup he watched. 'Didn't they have a TV?' he jokes. In . a couple of weeks, when the England circus arrives en masse in Brazil, a . nation will watch them try to progress through the group phase. Taking sides: Wilshere puts on his bib during England training . Heading to Brazil: Wilshere will be part the England squad hoping to do well at the World Cup . 'The young players are not used to being disappointed coming home from a World Cup so we don't know what to expect,' he added. 'We're just going over there wanting to do well. We also have the likes of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, who have been there three or four times.' Gerrard and Lampard are the main men . around the squad, two players with senior status and the privileges that . go with it. Wilshere was sitting on a sun lounger at England's training . camp in Portugal last week when his phone alerted him to a text . message. Magic memories: Wilshere remembers Michael Owen's goal for England against Argentina . Sad times: David Batty missed a penalty in the shot out as England were knocked in 1998 . 'I didn't ask for it, but a text came through saying I was No 7 (he wears 10 for Arsenal). 'I'll have to get new boots with my number - Rooney wants 10, Gerrard four, Lampard eight. The senior players pick the numbers and we get the rest. So I have No 7. Bryan Robson, David Beckham wore it, so it is nice to get that number. Beckham was my hero growing up as well so it is quite nice.' This summer it will be the turn of the new breed to make an impact as England prepare to play Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica in their opening three group games. Listening to the boss: Roy Hodgson speaks to Wilshere and the rest of the England squad . Wilshere has only won 15 caps because of his recurring injury problems, but Hodgson remains a huge fan of the midfielder's technical ability.While he prefers to play in 4-2-3-1, 'as we do at Arsenal', Wilshere is realistic enough to know that he is simply fighting for a place in England's midfield with Jordan Henderson and Ross Barkley. England's head coach is demanding that little bit more from his players now, pushing them as they prepare for Friday's friendly with Peru at Wembley. 'He can lose it (with the players) a little bit, but if someone isn't doing it he has every right to do that,' he added. There will also come a time when the team prepare for the possibility of a penalty shootout and Wilshere will be one of the first to put up his hand. 'I read that the boss (Wenger) said I'm not a penalty taker. Cheers boss! It's strange actually because we did penalties before and I scored mine. Maybe he just thinks English people can't take penalties. But we have some good penalty takers here. Rickie Lambert is great at penalties, Gerrard is great at penalties. 'I took one at Bradford away in the Carling Cup. I know that is a bit different to playing in Brazil at a World Cup, but I scored and I'd be happy to take one.'","Wilshere was injured playing for England against Denmark in March .

"Three people were killed and six injured when cars collided with spectators in two different crashes within hours of each other at the Jim Clark Rally in the Scottish Borders. Police said the most serious crash took place at about 4pm when a competing car came off the road near Kelso, hitting spectators. Three were pronounced dead at the scene and a fourth is in a critical condition in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Two hours earlier, a rally car hit five people.

Spectator Tony Cowan told the BBC: 'It was just one car which lost control. It went sideways one way and then to the other side of the road and ploughed into four people. 'It was terrible, absolutely terrible. I ran to help but there was little I could do. The air ambulance arrived after about three quarters of an hour. There were police cars and ambulances. It was chaos, just chaos.' Another spectator, Tommy Tait, wrote on Facebook: 'We must be like cats have nine lives never have we been so close to getting wiped out by a rally car our thoughts go out to the 4 who got hit.' The rally takes place over three days . on closed roads in the Duns and Kelso areas and is named after Scottish . Formula One driver Jim Clark, who grew up . in the area. He was killed in a motor racing accident in Hockenheim, . Germany, in 1968. Local MSP .

"On the heels of an announcement that HBO would offer a standalone version of its streaming service, CBS announced it was rolling out its own. The network launched CBS All Access on Thursday, offering live and on-demand shows that can be streamed through apps and on the CBS website. Though Recode hails the move as the TV industry weaning itself off of cable providers, CBS says it considers the All Access service a supplement to what the network offers on TV. Demand: CBS says its All Access service is for the 'super-fans' who want more content, not to challenge cable providers like Comcast . 'It’s about super-fans being able to get a lot more of our content,' said CBS CEO Leslie Moonves. The service is similar to what HBO Go already offers current subscribers of the premium cable channel. CBS All Access customers will be able to watch on-demand episodes of shows like Big Bang Theory or stream shows at the same time they air on television. There are also comparisons to Aereo, the streaming service airing network television without paying programming fees, that was sued into near non-existence by the networks. The biggest difference between what customers get on TV and what they get on their iPads is that All Access will not stream NFL on CBS coverage because it does not have a deal with the league. Customers will also need to be within one of the 14 cities where CBS owns a local station, limiting the service mainly to metropolitan areas like New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago. Good deal? CBS announced customers of CBS All Access would be able to stream live and on-demand shows like The Good Wife through its $6 a month service . For those who hate television ads, CBS says that the $6-a-month service will stream older on-demand shows ad free and has cut down the frequency of ads 25 percent on newer shows. It's not a given that the service will pull in a significant share of customers looking to pay for CBS shows when they air for free or come bundled with cable subscriptions. The CBS audience is currently older than that of other networks, which means they watch most of their live television on the television. Recode notes  Hulu Plus, which airs Fox, NBC and ABC shows on-demand, has 6 million subscribers, though that subscription also offers basic cable programming such as Comedy Central.","CBS All Access launched Thursday with live and on-demand programming that can be streamed through the CBS website and on mobile apps .

"Why Steve McClaren vs Harry Redknapp is a victory for England, no matter what the result and my five things to look forward to most this summer . The Champions League final is the pinnacle of club football, a game that defines reputations and creates legends. For Diego Simeone, Atletico Madrid’s manager, Saturday night's collision with Real Madrid in Lisbon presents him with an opportunity to put the gloss on an extraordinary season and complete what could be the greatest managerial achievement of all time. VIDEO Scroll down for The five main men of Atletico Madrid . Moving the goalposts: Diego Simeone guided Atletico Madrid to the La Liga title this season . In the mix: Costa (centre) shares a joke with team-mates as spirits were high before training . Make us dream: Atletico fans on the streets of Lisbon on Friday ahead of the final . When you look at the distinguished names who have lifted the biggest trophy of all — Rinus Michels, Sir Matt Busby and Bob Paisley, through to Arrigo Sacchi, Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola — to say Simeone is potentially 90 minutes away from outstripping them all might seem bold. But this is all about context and what Simeone has achieved since he became Atletico manager on December 23, 2011 is extraordinary. If he is to mastermind another victory over his neighbours, who are the richest club in the world, Simeone would stand alone. These are the reasons. Atletico are a big club but they are not one of the giants of Europe, like Barcelona or Real Madrid,  Bayern Munich, the Milan clubs or Manchester United and Liverpool, where success at home and in Europe is demanded. There have been shock winners of the European Cup before, such as Steaua Bucharest (1986), PSV Eindhoven (1988), Red Star Belgrade (1991) and Porto (2004), but Atletico would be unlike them because they are not the consistently dominant force in their own country that those clubs were. They are different, also, from Rafa Benitez’s Valencia team, the last club outside Real and Barca to win La Liga. Benitez’s . work cannot be knocked but Valencia had not come from nowhere, as they . had played in two consecutive Champions League finals (2000 and 2001) under Hector Cuper. Think about the position Atletico were in when Simeone was appointed. They . were 10th in La Liga, but just four points off relegation, and were . struggling after selling their prize assets Sergio Aguero and David de . Gea to ease mounting tax debts. Under . Simeone, though, the rise has been relentless and rapid. He capped his . first six months in charge by winning the Europa League, as Atletico . beat Bilbao 3-0, having overseen a rise in La Liga that took them to . fifth place. Made the most: Simeone is on the cusp of greatness with Atletico Madrid with such limited resources . It can happen again: Porto were the shock winners in 2004 with a 3-0 win over Monaco in Gelsenkirchen . My stash: Bob Paisley relaxes with an array of trophies during his time at Liverpool . Start of it all: Alex Ferguson lifting the European Cup Winners Cup with Aberdeen in 1983 . The European Super Cup, thanks to a . 4-1 dismantling of Chelsea, and the Copa del Rey followed in  2012-13. But this is the campaign where Simeone has really worked his magic, . resulting in Atletico’s  stunning triumph in La Liga, their first . domestic title since he was a player in 1995-96. Do . not underestimate the size of this feat. Money is no object to Barca . and Real, while they have the world’s two best players in Lionel Messi . and Cristiano Ronaldo, yet Atletico won on merit with 90 points. Their . performance to clinch the title in the Nou Camp last Saturday had class . stamped over it. So now it . is on to the final hurdle and the men Simeone should be measured against . are Brian Clough, and Alex Ferguson — during his time with Aberdeen. Consecutive: Brian Clough won the European Cup twice with Nottingham Forest in 1979 and 1980 . Man at the top: Guardiola won the trophy twice in his time at Barcelona, and is up there with the greats . Ferguson’s story at Aberdeen is remarkable. He broke up the Old Firm’s dominance of the Scottish First Division and led Aberdeen, against the odds, to beat Real Madrid in the 1983 European Cup-Winners’ Cup final but, unlike Atletico, they never made their mark in the European Cup. Clough and Nottingham Forest, by contrast, certainly did. It is incredible to think, given where they are now, that Forest have won as many European Cups as Juventus, Porto and Benfica — what they managed between 1977 and 1980 simply wouldn’t be  possible in the modern era. From third place in the old Second Division, Forest became champions of England before winning, then retaining, the European Cup. Their success came during a golden era for English clubs in Europe, as aside from Liverpool’s four victories, Aston Villa also won it. Double up: Jose Mourinho has won the competition twice, with Porto and Inter Milan . Minnows? Atletico are a selling club, letting Radamel Falcao go to Monaco last season . Limbering up: Costa (left) goes through some stretches as manager Simeone walks beside him . Forest added the European Super Cup and two League Cups in that glittering period, but Clough had financial help and was able to build on success — he famously made Trevor Francis, scorer of the  winning goal in the 1979 European Cup, England’s first £1million player. Atletico, by contrast, are a selling club, with debts last reported to be in excess of €167million (£135m). Simeone lost Radamel Falcao last summer but he took that in his stride. Results never suffered and he made Diego Costa one of the most feared strikers in Europe. He will find another gem once the Chelsea-bound Costa goes the way of Aguero and Falcao. Simeone will never be a favourite for the purists, given the style Atletico favour, but it is impossible to argue given what they have done in the last two-and-a-half years. Barking orders: Carlo Ancelotti will be looking to guide Real Madrid to the club's tenth European Cup victory . Ferguson once said that a team embody their manager’s character and that is absolutely true of Atletico — not one player will ever shirk the relentless work ethic that Simeone had during his own  playing career. There will be questions for Simeone to answer in the future, if and when he moves on, about whether he will be able to replicate his success at the Vicente Calderon with a bigger club, as he would have to change his style to be more open and attractive. For the moment that can wait. There are so many strands to this Champions League final, from whether Cristiano Ronaldo can fulfil his destiny to whether Carlo Ancelotti can emulate Paisley and become the second manager to win three European Cups. Should Simeone land his first, however, the achievement would put him out on his own. Thumbs up: Cristiano Ronaldo is expected to be fit for Real Madrid's Champions League final showdown .","Simeone could complete the greatest managerial achievement of all time .

"He is best known as the world's most renowned astrophysicist. But now Professor Stephen Hawking could soon be topping the music charts after making a cameo vocal performance on the brand new album by Pink Floyd. The computerised voice of the acclaimed Cambridge scientist will feature on the track entitled 'Talkin Hawkin' on the new record called The Endless River. Professor Stephen Hawking, whose computerised voice is to feature on the new Pink Floyd album . The album, which is the band's first studio record in 20 years is one of the year's most eagerly anticipated new releases, which is due out next month. In the song his computerised voice begins by saying: 'For millions of years, mankind lived just like the animals. Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination.' However, it isn't the first time Professor Hawking has featured on one of the band's songs. In 1994, he appeared on the band's last studio album called The Division Bell in a song called Keep Talking. The track featured a sample of his narration for a British Telecom commercial. It is thought that vocalist Dave Gilmour wanted to include the narration after seeing the advert, which nearly made him weep. Pink Floyd pictured following their last concert together in 2005. (L to R) Dave Gilmour, Roger Waters, Nick Mason and Richard Wright, who died in September 2008. Roger Waters will not feature on the band's new album . Professor Hawking suffers from motor neurone disease and despite being confined to a wheelchair since the 1970s, he has produced a stream of first class research, including probably his most important contribution to cosmology. This was the discovery of Hawking radiation, which allows a black hole to leak energy and gradually fade away to nothing. In the 1980s, Professor Hawking and Professor Jim Hartle, from the University of California at Santa Barbara, proposed a model of the universe which had no boundaries in space or time. The track called Talkin Hawkin will feature on the album The Endless River, the band's first new studio album in 20 years . The concept was described in A Brief History Of Time, which sold 25million copies worldwide. In recent years, Professor Hawking has examined the relationship between science and religion, writing a 2010 book, Grand Design, which argues that evoking God is not necessary to explain the origins of the universe. But he is as much a celebrity as he is a scientist, appearing on TV cartoon The Simpsons and starring in Star Trek. Earlier this year he also produced a mathematical formula on how to take the perfect penalty in football to help boost England's chances at the World Cup.","Acclaimed physicist's voice to feature on the new Pink Floyd album .

"Murdered parish councillor turned pagan Peter Solheim was part of a child abuse gang that used satanic imagery such as daggers and gowns to intimidate victims, a court heard yesterday. Solheim was named during the trial of two other men facing a string of sexual offence charges dating back to the 1970s. Satantist Solheim was brutally murdered and dumped in the Channel off the coast of Cornwall in 2004, having been drugged and mutilated with a weapon. Deadly relationship: Peter Solheim, left, was found murdered and drugged off the Cornwall coast in 2004. His girlfriend Margaret James, right, was jailed for conspiring to murder Solheim in 2006 . His former girlfriend Margaret James was jailed for her involvement in the murder in 2006, having become jealous about an affair, but her accomplice has never been found. Solheim was accused of being a member of a pagan gang, operating in Cornwall from the 1970s onwards, who plied children with alcohol before making them undress in front of robed men. Victims were sexually abused by their tormentors, before being silenced by sweets and money, Truro Crown Court heard. The allegations were made during the case of Peter Petrauske and Jack Kemp, also accused of being part of the gang. Prosecutor Jason Beal told the court that Petrauske, 72, who referred to himself as the 'high priest of a white witch coven', had named both Solheim and Kemp. He said: 'When the police arrested Peter Petrauske, without them mentioning any names, he came out with the names Jack Kemp and Peter Solheim.' 'He knew the names because he had been a part of that gang - not a gang of pagans but a gang of child abusers.' Mr Beal said that victims had also reported being abused by Solheim. White witch: Peter Petrauske, pictured, is accused of being part of a pagan sex gang that abused children in Cornwall from the 1970s . Following suggestions from Petrauske's defence that he was the victim of a 'witch-hunt', Mr Beal said: 'They (the alleged victims) are not people who have just picked out the local weirdo (in an ID parade). It is because of what he did [to them].' In 2005, Stanley Pirie, a friend of Petrauske and Kemp, was convicted at the same court of child sex abuse. One of his victims who gave evidence during that trial has since accused Petrauske and Kemp of also sexually abusing her during the same period of her childhood. Kemp faces 15 charges of sexual assaults on youngsters aged between just three and 15, while Petrauske, faces three charges of indecent assault and one of rape. The abuse charges span three decades from the late 1970s to 2009, the jury was told. But counsel for the duo yesterday told the jury that Petrauske and Kemp played no part in the abuse. Referring to his client as a 'weirdo', Sean Brunton defending Petrauske, said 'medieval justice' was used to torture and kill people who behaved strangely or differently as soon as others began to point the finger of accusation. Pagans: The jury at Truro Crown Court, pictured, heard from victims about the ritualistic sex abuse . He added: 'Don’t fall into the trap of thinking: ‘Who does he (Petrauske) think he is? He’s obviously a weirdo’. 'While those who don’t follow the crowd are criticised, it’s not yet illegal to be a weirdo. 'All a defendant can do in a case like this is to say: ""I didn’t do it. I have never done it. I will say it again, I didn’t know them (the alleged victims).”’ Jo Martin, defending 69-year-old Kemp, said the case against her client was one of 'no smoke without fire', after the jury had been told of Kemp’s previous convictions for sexual offences several decades ago. 'You cannot convict someone solely on previous behaviour or his associations,' she said. 'That would be entirely wrong.' Ms Martin added: 'There’s no doubt that Jack Kemp was friends with Stanley Pirie and is friends with his co-defendant, Peter Petrauske. But Jack Kemp is not involved in paganism.' She said her client had been to 'two or three' pagan meetings and some social events, but that this had been in the mid-to-late 1990s, after the alleged abuse took place. She added: 'The pagan aspect is high drama. But it has absolutely nothing to do with Jack Kemp. That is the biggest red herring of this particular case.' The court previously heard how the pair were also interested in 'wife-swapping'. Kemp’s ex wife Pamela James, said that she and ‘German Pete’ Petrauske had sex a number of times between the early 70s and 80s. Mrs James, who divorced Kemp after his arrest last December, said: 'My husband knew about it, he wanted me to. It was a wife swapping stage we went through.' She said her then husband also slept with another woman in their home in Falmouth, Cornwall, as she slept downstairs.

"Counter-terrorism police have conducted more raids following major operations in Sydney and Brisbane that saw four people charged, including one accused of plotting to kidnap and kill members of the public. The additional search warrants were carried out on Thursday night, according to Australian Federal Police acting commissioner Andrew Colvin. Police were still  turning up backyards late into the night looking for weapons and evidence following the biggest anti-terrorism raids in Australian history. Mr Colvin would not reveal further details but said the investigation was far from over. A 'number of people' were still being detained following the raids in Brisbane and Sydney on Thursday morning. Scroll down for video . Omarjan Azari appeared in Sydney's Central Local Court charged with conspiracy to prepare a terrorist attack on Australian soil . Omarjan Azari, 22, was the first to be charged in the nation's largest counter-terrorism operation. He appeared in court on Thursday charged with a conspiracy to prepare a terrorist attack on Australian soil. According to court documents, police intercepted a phone call three days ago between Omarjan Azari and Mohammad Ali Baryalei, who is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East. The account said Baryalei ordered him to carry out an attack, which Sydney Central Local Court heard was 'clearly designed to shock, horror and terrify the community'. A second man, a 24-year-old from Merrylands in Sydney's west, was charged with possessing ammunition without license and unauthorised possession of a prohibited weapon. He has been bailed to appear in Fairfield Local Court on September 24th. A large sword was seized as part of the evidence found at a home in the suburb of Marsfield, in Sydney . The accused terrorist was taken from court in a high risk security orange prison jumpsuit by heavily armed NSW Corrective Services officer . Nine people were detained on Thursday, and two females were issued Future Court Attendance Notices. It comes as Prime Minister Tony Abbott revealed on Friday morning that terrorists were 'within days' of carrying out planned attacks on Parliament House and a possible public beheading on Sydney streets. He said the detainees were people 'of interest to our police and security services in connection with terrorist events we believe, on the basis of intelligence, were likely within a few days'. Mr Abbott said the national security challenge was 'more serious today than at any time in the past'. 'It is a serious situation when all you need to do to carry out a terrorist attack is to have a knife, an iPhone and a victim,' he said. The prime minister said he had been advised in early September of potential threats to 'government, government people and Parliament House'. This triggered a review of security and a decision to put the AFP in charge of internal and external security of the parliament. 'The community expects government at all levels to keep them safe and this government will not let them down.' About 12 homes were searched in Sydney's northwest suburbs by NSW Police and Australian Federal Police (AFP). Police executed search warrants in Beecroft, Bellavista, Guildford, Merrylands, Northmead, Wentworthville, Marsfield, Westmead, Castle Hill, Revesby, Bass Hill and Regents Park. The AFP also carried out three search warrants in Brisbane in the suburbs of Mount Gravatt East, Logan and Underwood. The Queensland raids were not directly related to the operations in Sydney. Bundles of cash and a curved sword inscribed with black foreign lettering were some of the incriminating pieces of evidence removed from a Sydney home during Thursday's terror raids . An armed police officer escorted Azari from court into a waiting prison van . Omarjan Azari's lawyer Steve Boland did not apply for bail for the accused terrorist but asked Magistrate Richard Bailey if Azari could go back down to the dock during the hearing. Magistrate Bailey agreed and Azari, who had sat in the dock stroking his beard and smiled briefly while talking to Mr Boland, left the courtroom. He is due to reappear in court via video link from prison on November 13. The accused terrorist was taken from court in a high risk security orange prison jumpsuit by heavily armed NSW Corrective Services officers. Officers with shotguns drove Azari - who put his head down between his handcuffs in the back seat of an armoured vehicle - from Central Local Court where the Sydney man made a brief appearance. As a person accused of conspiracy to prepare for a terrorist act, Azari will be taken to a maximum security prison, most likely the High Risk Management Correctional Centre - also known as Supermax - inside Goulburn prison. Heavily armed police have made a number of arrests in a series of dawn raids in northwest Sydney . A car was searched across the road from the house that Omarjan Azari was arrested at . NSW Police filmed the arrests of the terror suspects on Thursday morning . A man kneels on the ground in Sydney after being detained by police during the raid . 'Police believe that this group that we have executed this operation on today had the intention, and had started to carry out planning, to commit violent acts here in Australia,' AFP Acting Commissioner Andrew Colvin told reporters in Sydney. 'Those violent acts particularly related to random acts against members of the public.' Police sources revealed more details to Daily Mail Australia, that the plot involved abducting a member of the public in Sydney and beheading them. ABC reported that the abducted member of the public would be draped in an Islamic State flag and beheaded on camera. Channel Seven reports that the random beheading would have been carried out in the streets of Martin Place in Sydney's CBD.

"Rafael van der Vaart has been ruled out of the World Cup after injuring his calf in Holland training. The Hamburg captain helped his side narrowly avoid relegation from the Bundesliga this season after they a play-off with Greuther Furth. He is expected to be replaced in Louis van Gaal's squad by 23-year-old PSV Eindhoven midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum. Missing out: Holland international Rafael van der Vaart will miss the World Cup through injury . Sidelined: Van der Vaart picked up the injury in a training session with the Dutch side . The KNVB confirmed the news in an official statement which said: 'Rafael van der Vaart will miss the World Cup in the Brazil. The Holland international has a calf strain in his right leg. 'Coach Louis van Gaal has therefore decided not to include him in the final selection.' Former Tottenham and Real Madrid man Van der Vaart, has 109 caps for Holland and has scored 25 goals as well as helping them reach the 2010 World Cup final in South Africa where they lost 1-0 to Spain. Van der Vaart was the most experienced player in the Dutch preliminary squad, but had already suffered an illness prior to his injury as he struggled to press his claim for inclusion in the final 23-man party which will be named on Saturday. The injury will come as a particular blow for the veteran after he recently told Dutch television station NOS about leaving his troubles at club level behind to enjoy playing for the national team. He said: 'It feels like such a relief after such a season with Hamburg. 'If you come to the national team, the level is higher and there players there who have won titles. 'That's why the mood is so positive, I feel really comfortable here.' Van der Vaart's absence will also be a blow to Van Gaal after he assisted six goals for Hamburg during the 2013-14 campaign, the highest of any Dutchman in Europe's top five leagues. Van der Vaart is part of a band of experienced players in a young Holland squad alongside Manchester United striker Robin van Persie, Galatasaray's Wesley Sneijder and former Liverpool forward Dirk Kuyt.

"It is the fairytale ball little girls the world over would dream of. But for these Brazilian 15-year-olds, the debutante dance is particularly special. They were brought up in Rio de Janeiro's Cerro-Cora 'favela' slum, a world away from the upper-middle-classes that have the money to spend a fortune on their child's 'coming out'. A dream come true: This is one of the 13 girls from Rio de Janeiro's Cerro-Cora slum  that got to take part in a specially-funded debutante ball . Ecstastic: Coming of age parties are normally reserved for the upper tiers of society but the district police organized one for these girls . A community effort: The dresses were loaned by a clothing store and they were made up by volunteers, with police choreographing the event . Cheers! An officer pours drinks for the delighted 15-year-olds who celebrated their transition from childhood to adulthood in style . Party time: One girl, Marceli Rosa, waves out the roof of their loaned pink limo to crowds of photographers capturing the special moment . However, in a bid to reconquer the district from drug-dealing gangs, the Pacifying Police Unit has funded a ball especially for the poorest young ladies of society. Smiling ear-to-ear, and glistening head-to-toe, the 13 girls were made up by volunteers and their dresses were loaned by a formal wear shop. The police unit along with some teachers and parents then helped them to practice the ceremony before the big night on October 31. A tradition across the continent: Many Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America celebrate the landmark in a party called Quinceañera (15th) Final touches: The girls glistened from head-to-toe in tiaras, jewelry and jeweled gowns as they prepared to have their first dance in the castle . A celebration: The event was designed as a celebration to reconquer the district from drug-dealing gangs which have prevailed in the slums . They drove through the city on a pink limousine, also loaned to the group. Each one was escorted into the Ilha Fiscal castle on the arm of an officer after toasting their transition from childhood to adulthood. The neo-Gothic castle on the Guanabara Bay was inaugurated in 1889 and is famed for holding the last Imperial Ball in November of 1889, just six days before Brazil became a Republic. Suited and booted: The dapper police officers stood ready and waiting to take the girls into the Ilha Fiscal castle on the Guanabara Bay . First dance: After being escorted in on an officer's arm, each girl danced hand-in-hand with their suitor under the starry skies . A picture of beauty: They lined up outside the neo-Gothic castle for pictures to capture the moment their parents could never have imagined . Getting back to the party: The soiree lasted late into the night as the girls got the most out of the bespoke, glimmering dresses . Over the moon: This 15-year-old looks delighted as she darts back into the dance hall to savor the night on Thursday . The party got going: Brothers, friends, and fathers were then allowed to flock onto the dance floor to treat the girls to a dance .","50 young girls from Rio de Janeiro's Cerro-Cora favela slum were loaned dresses for the ball on November 6 .

"Scroll down for video . Police have conducted a dramatic bedside interview with the state trooper critically injured in the Poconos sniper shootings, and have cleared him of having an affair with the sole suspect's sister-in-law. Trooper Alex Douglass insisted he does not even know Melissa Frein, the wife of fugitive Eric Frein's older brother, a source close to the investigation told MailOnline exclusively. Police had earlier said the two — who live less than half a mile apart in Olyphant, Pennsylvania — may have known each other and that Eric Frein, who is being sought after 15 days on the run, may have thought they were having an affair. Trooper Alex Douglass (left) insisted he does not even know Melissa Frein, the wife of fugitive Eric Frein's older brother, a source close to the investigation told Mail Online . 'Douglass said he had not even met her,' said the source. 'Of course we don't know what Eric Frein believed.' Cops hunting Eric Frein hope Douglass's denial will put to rest rumors that have swept the Poconos that he was involved with Melissa. Deputy police commander Lt. Col. George Bivens reacted with annoyance at questions about the alleged affair during an hour-long press briefing on Friday. He said Douglass, who was shot below the waist, was 'troubled' by the focus on his private life. Douglass, 31, remains critically injured in serious but stable condition following the September 12 shooting which killed his colleague, father-of-two Corporal Bryon Dickson, 38. If Frein had believed the trooper was involved with his sister-in-law, it could help explain why he drove 25 miles to the Blooming Grove police barracks to carry out his deadly attack rather than pick a target closer to home. Yesterday the FBI, along with state troopers, continued the manhunt for Eric Frein in a wooded area at Buck Hill Falls in Barrett Township Pennsylvania . But police believe he picked Blooming Grove because it is isolated and allowed him to hide in the woods to shoot, whereas other police stations are closer to areas of population. They insist that it is mere coincidence that one of the shot men lives just a stone's throw from his brother. Early in the investigation cops 'aggressively interviewed' Melissa Frein as rumors of the affair circulated. 'We have investigated the rumor of the affair thoroughly after we learned about it, Pennsylvania Sate police spokesman Trooper Tom Kelly told MailOnline earlier this week. 'There is no truth to the affair. 'We used thorough investigative techniques and questioned Melissa Frein extensively. She denied it and we do not believe she is being deceptive.' It is understood that Melissa Frein passed a polygraph test which helped police reach the conclusion she was not involved with Trooper Douglass. Cops hunting Eric Frein (pictured holding a sniper in his room) hope Douglass's denial will put to rest rumors that have swept the Poconos that he was involved with Melissa . Melissa is married to Frein's older brother Michael. Eric Frein was best man at their 2007 wedding at St. Joseph Melkite Greek Catholic Church in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Melissa Frein has not returned MailOnline calls for comment. Bivens called Frein, a survivalist who is said to harbor a deep grudge against law enforcement an 'assassin' during Friday's briefing. Addressing Frein personally, Bivens said: 'Eric, as I told you last week, you are a coward. 'Your actions have caused tremendous disruption to an innocent community while you try to hide from us. State Police and the FBI are still hunting for survivalist Frein after he allegedly shot dead father-of-two Corporal Bryon Dickson, 38 (right) at his police barracks in Blooming Grove, Pennsylvania . 'We are not intimidated and we will not leave. We have a clear mission with specific objectives — protect the community, find you and bring you to justice.' Cops have now commandeered another abandoned building — known locally just as 'The Mansion' high in the woods off Snow Hill Road. The building, deep in the woods where Frein is believed to be hiding has an airstrip, allowing police helicopters and planes to use it as a base. Bivens said police believe Frein may have a radio and could be monitoring press reports of the massive manhunt that has consumed hundreds of thousands of police manhours and consumed Canadensis and surrounding areas in the picturesque Poconos. Police have said they have had Frein, 31, cornered in a five-square-mile area of dense forest in rugged countryside south of Canadensis. But they have had no sighting of their quarry since late Tuesday afternoon. Police have said they have had Frein, 31, cornered in a five-square-mile area of dense forest in rugged countryside south of Canadensis. State Police and FBI have a heavy presence in the area . Before that they have said he has approached the perimeter of their search area, staying just far enough away that officers could not get a clear shot at him. They say dogs flushed him out at one stage but he was far enough away to flee. Bivens said he believes the search has now become a game for the military simulation fan. To him, It's a game — a war game if you like,' the top cop said. On Saturday the Philadelphia Inquirer  reported that cops had discovered a jacket they believe belongs to Frein in the woods, along with protein bar wrappers. The previous day, the same paper said sources had told it cops had discovered bombmaking equipment in Frein's parents' home — a claim that Bivens implicitly accepted — and that Frein had tried to call his parents on September 18 and the 'ping' from his cellphone had helped cops locate him. Bivens also revealed that Frein had bought equipment that would help him build a bunker in the woods. However he said the intensive search had failed to discover that bunker. Heavily-armed officers with combat gear and night vision have spent days looking through the woods . He also said that searches of a computer that Frein used had shown that he had been planning the attack for at least two years. He said the computer showed he had researched how to avoid police manhunts, law enforcement technology and survival skills. Bivens told reporters: 'I suspect he wants a fight with state police but I suspect that involves hiding and running not a face to face confrontation — trying to take a shot from a concealed location as he has in the past.' Police have previously said they found soiled diapers and a rare brand of Serbian cigarettes in the woods. Survivalist material found in Frein's parents home advise the wearing of diapers to allow someone to stay in place for extended periods. Frein is known to be obsessed with Serbia, a country he has visited at least once. He was a member of Istocni Vuk — which translates to Eastern Wolves — a military simulation team which reenacts battles from the Yugoslav civil wars of the 1990s. Despite police assurances that Frein is contained in an area bounded by Snow Hill Road and Bear Town Road south of Canadensis, they continue to search other areas. Around 11 p.m. on Friday night a helicopter with a bright blinking light flew over woods a few hundred yards west of the search area. Suddenly the light was extinguished and the chopper continued to fly in darkness as a convoy of heavily armed police sped to the site . 'They soon came back, obviously having found nothing,' a man who watched the scene unfold told MailOnline. Earlier the same day hundreds of police descended on the abandoned Inn at Buck Hill Falls, four miles north of the main search site and spent more than half a day in an intensive search of the 400-room property and its grounds. Frein is known to be acquainted with the crumbling hulk of a building, which has become a hangout spot for bored local teens since its closure in 1991.","Eric Frein may have targeted trooper Alex Douglass believing he had an affair with the wife of survivalist's older brother .

"An incredible collection of the earliest tabloid 'newspapers', which detail the shocking crimes and dying confessions of hanged 18th century convicts, are due to be sold at auction next week. The so-called 'Execution Broadsides' - which usually consisted of just a single sheet of paper - documented the gruesome and gory facts and rumours which surrounded public hangings. The sheets of printed news, which were usually sold for a penny near the gallows on the day of the hanging, covered the crime committed, a woodcut illustration, a description of the convict's final hours and their last dying confession - all in sensational, dramatic detail. 'Execution Broadsides' were produced to sell for a penny on the day of a hanging and included the gruesome and gory facts which surrounded hangings in the 18th and 19th Centuries. This sheet include details of the trial  of  Patrick  Carroll,   for  the Wilful  Murder  of  Mrs  Browning and was sold in 1835 . The sheets of printed news, which were  sold for a penny near the gallows on the day of the hanging, covered the crime committed, a woodcut illustration, a description of the convict's final hours and his last dying confession. This sheet involves the trial and execution of Henry Hughes, for Violating Emma Cock in 1834 . Vendors would set up their carts and booths hours before execution time, selling food, drink, souvenirs and even pornographic material to a frenzied crowd. Minstrels and jugglers also entertained the masses, while touts tried to sell the lurid 'broadsheets', which came about due to the advent of cheap printing in the 16th and 17th centuries. Now, eleven clippings from a private collection from the 18th and 19th centuries are being sold at at Dominic Winter Auctioneers in Cirencester, Gloucester. Chris Albury, an auctioneer and senior valuer, said the historic sheets show the 'fun' tabloid journalism of the day and are seen as one of the first examples of tabloid journalism. He said: 'They are good fun. It's tabloid journalism of the day. The wood cuts are quite crude. They are very graphic, dramatic items. 'It is nice to see such a big group of them together. A collection like this is routinely found in the British Library. Behind every copy there is a great story. Also, the more gruesome the crime, the more interested people are.' Vendors would set up their carts and booths hours before execution time, selling food, drink, souvenirs and even pornographic material to a frenzied crowd. This sheet refers to the hanging of William Harley for a burglary in 1836 . The 'broadsheets' came about due to the advent of cheap printing in the 16th and 17th centuries. This early example of tabloid journalism involved details of the murder of James Andrew Macauley, a young sailor, in 1834 . Eleven clippings from that era are being sold at Dominic Winter Auctioneers in Cirencester, Gloucester. One of those being auctioned is the story of the execution of R. Blakesley, who murdered James Burdon in 1841 . This sheet covers the confession and excution of J. Tawell, who was hanged for the murder of Sarah Hart in 1845, with whom he had an affair . Each of the execution broadsides - which span from 1787 1846 - covers one particular crime from the time, with text and drawings both giving the reader details of the horrific crime. One headline reads: 'The Father's Crime; or Fatal Curiosity. An affecting and true history of The Unnatural Murder of James Andrew Macauley, a Young Sailor, For his Wealth, and who proved, on the Morning after the Fatal Deed, to be the Murderer's long-lost and only son!' Four of the sheets cover the brutal murders of people in the community, while other covered stories include a burglary and 'violating Emma Cock, a girl only 8 years old'.

"A new drug for men with advanced prostate cancer gives them five months’ extra life when they have run out of options. Doctors hope the British discovery will help turn prostate cancer from a killer disease into a chronic illness by combining new and older agents. Trials showed men taking enzalutamide survived for more than 18 months compared with less than 14 months for those on a placebo. Condition: Doctors hope prostate cancer can be turned from a killer disease into a chronic illness (picture posed by models) Almost half of those receiving the new drug had a better quality of life. About 10,500 British men have advanced prostate cancer that has become resistant to standard hormone treatments. Enzalutamide, which was developed by British scientists at the Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden Hospital, in London, is one of four discoveries in the past two years that significantly extend life. Professor Alan Ashworth, chief executive of the ICR, said cancer research in the UK was finally delivering new treatments for men with advanced prostate cancer. ‘Advanced prostate cancer is extremely difficult to treat, and it’s taken a massive co-ordinated effort to finally bring new drugs into the pipeline, after decades where there were no options once old-style hormone treatment stopped working,’ he said. ‘What we’re seeing now is an unprecedented period of success for prostate cancer research, with four new drugs shown to extend life in major clinical trials in just two years, and several others showing promise. ‘It truly is a golden age for prostate cancer drug discovery and development.’ Nearly 1,200 patients were given enzalutamide following chemotherapy. Survival for those taking the new drug was 18.4 months on average, compared with 13.6 months for those on a placebo. Findings: A thermograph showing prostate cancer. Around half those who received the new drug had a better quality of life . About 43 per cent of men on enzalutamide reported an improved quality of life, compared with 18 per cent of the placebo group, reported the New England Journal of Medicine. In November last year, the trial’s Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended it be stopped early and men who received the placebo be offered enzalutamide. The drug, made by pharmaceutical companies Medivation and Astellas, could be licensed for use by British patients early next year. The cost is not yet known. Professor Martin Gore, of the Royal Marsden Hospital, said ‘We are delighted with the recent progress that has been made in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.’ Dr Kate Holmes, of Prostate Cancer UK, said ‘Effective treatments for men in the final stages of the disease have been lacking for far too long. ‘Should this drug go on to be licensed, it could provide a welcome addition to the available treatments for men with this form of the disease.’",Enzalutamide survived for more than 18 months compared to 14 for those on a placebo .
"Authorities may never piece together a full picture of the last hours of beautiful and happy Utah family of five all found dead in their home, a family spokesman said Tuesday. The Stracks of Springfield--Benjamin and Kristi Strack, 37 and 36; with children Benson, 14; Zion, 11; and 12-year-old Emery--were all found by an older son and grandparent in the parents' room on Saturday. They showed no signs of physical struggle, no wounds were found and a test for carbon monoxide in the home came back negative. 'We understand that those answers will take time, and that it is likely we will never know everything in perfect detail,' said Bob McGee. Scroll down for video... Perished: The Strack family of Springville, Utah were all found dead on Saturday . 'Likely we will never know everything': Unidentified people gather as Bob McGee, right, spokesperson for the relatives of five Utah family members found dead in their home over the weekend, speaks with reporters during a news conference . Haunting mystery: This photo from Sunday shows the home where five Utah family members found dead  of mysterious causes, in Springville, Utah. The bodies were found Saturday night about 45 miles south of Salt Lake City . The statement from McGee, uncle to the Strack children including the surviving son Janson, 18, was the first from the family since their loved ones' perplexing deaths. 'We are shocked and heartbroken by the sudden loss of so many members of our family,' Bob McGee said, reports Deseret. 'Events like this are difficult to understand, and even harder to come to terms with. And no words can adequately describe our feelings of grief and sorrow.' Even Springville Police Lieutenant Dave Caron, meanwhile, appeared daunted by the initial lack of a cause of death. 'I didn't get into law enforcement to not have answers. I got into law enforcement to have answers. Unfortunately, this is one of those cases where we just don't have them. I wish we did,' he told reporters. Even as the mystery goes unsolved, the Strack's community has started down the daunting path to healing. A GoFundMe page has been created to help surviving family with 'overwhelming' funeral costs ahead. The page devotes a few lines in remembrance of each family member, like father Benjamin. 'His heart was too big for this world and the love everyone felt when near him will not be forgotten,' it reads.

Not so long ago: Investigators have yet to lay down publicly a definite timeline of the family's deaths. Photos from their past show a family that appeared to be nothing but happy to have each other . The mom Kristi, the writer says, was 'charismatic, kind and loyal.' Her only daughter, Emery, loved animals. Fourteen-year-old Benson loved to draw dragons and practice karate. His younger brother Zion, the youngest, 'brought everyone he came across happiness and joy.' In spite of the roadblocks, police are still investigating what caused the deaths after preliminary autopsy results ruled out any sort of violent  foul play. On Monday, the first heart-wrenching photos emerged of the handsome family. And the Stracks are exactly how surviving family members remember them--always smiling. On Monday, the first first photos emerged of Benjamin and Kristi Strack, 37 and 36, (both pictured) who were found dead at their home in Springville, Utah with their sons Benson, 14, (top right) and Zion, 11, (left) and 12-year-old daughter Emery (bottom right) Benjamin Strack and his young family in a photo in 2010. Preliminary autopsy results have ruled out any sort of violent assault or foul play . Preliminary autopsy results have ruled out any sort of violent assault or foul play. 'The Medical Examiner has indicated that the next step is to continue the investigation through analysis of blood samples to determine what may have caused the deaths,' the Springville DPS said in a statement. 'Preliminary autopsy results for the family of five who were found dead in their home have ruled out any sort of violent assault,' Springville police said in a statement. Police Lt. Dave Caron said the cause of death has not been determined, and will not be until an analysis of blood samples is concluded. The medical examiner's office provided no time frame for the release of results of laboratory testing. The bodies were found shortly before 8 p.m. in the parents' bedroom by their 18-year-old  son Janson. Their son returned home and knew something was wrong because of how quiet the house was, said Springville Police Chief J. Scott Finlayson, reported Deseret News. He then went to his grandparents' home nearby to question their whereabouts, and returned with his grandmother to find the bodies. Caron said someone either saw or talked to the family Saturday morning, but he was unsure about the last person to make contact with them.

While a test of air in the house by firefighters did not find any carbon monoxide, investigators have not ruled that out as the cause of death . Emery, 12, was found alongside her brothers and parents. The bodies were found shortly before 8 p.m. in the parents' bedroom . While a test of air in the house by firefighters did not find any carbon monoxide, investigators have not ruled that out as the cause of death. The front door of the house was open and the back door was cracked open before firefighters arrived, Caron said, and the gas could have ventilated before the test. The family's pets were all fine. Asked whether foul play has been ruled out, Caron said, 'I don't rule out anything ... We haven't ruled out anything except there was no violent trauma. We're going to look at everything. 'I do know when I was in there (house) I didn't see anything that would suggest a struggle ... I saw nothing like that,' he added. A Facebook tribute page has been set up to remember the family. One user wrote: 'I feel a part of me has been lost. My brother Ben was my best friend.

'We did everything together. He always made me happy when he was around. Emery, Benson and Zion it seems like yesterday I was helping them with home work and taking them camping. I remember Benson caught his first fish with us on the trip.' Another user wrote: ' Ben is one of my best friends. He was always like a brother to me as we grew up. I will miss him so much. 'His kids had the biggest smiles every time I seen them.' On the tribute page another user wrote: ' I sat in a couple parent teacher conferences with both Ben and Kristi.

"A bride who is paralyzed from the waist down gave her wedding guests an unbelievable surprise when she walked down the aisle on the arm of her father. Gina Giaffoglione, a former gymnast from McClelland, Iowa, was involved in a serious car crash six years ago, and doctors said she'd never be able to use her legs again. But the 27-year-old was determined to walk down the aisle at her wedding to fiance John Springhower; and thanks to a crutch, a hidden back-brace and a year-and-a-half of grueling physical therapy and practice, she miraculously pulled it off. Scroll down for video . Amazing feat: Gina Giaffoglione, from McClelland, Iowa, is paralyzed from the waist down. She trained for months in physical therapy to be able to walk down the aisle on the arm of her father (pictured) at her wedding . Miracle: The 27-year-old used a crutch and a back brace to 'walk', holding onto her dad Gary for support . Emotional surprise: Guests gasped and watched in awe as Gina was lifted out of her wheelchair and began walking down the aisle with her father . Gina was just 21 when she got into a car with a drunk driver, a decision that would change her life forever. But even after the accident, she refused to let it hinder her life plans. In fact, she even continued to coach gymnastics at her father Gary's gym, making the most of her upper body strength. So it was no surprise when she came to him to tell him that she wanted to be able to walk down the aisle on his arm at her wedding. 'I told her, whether we roll down that aisle or whether we walk down that aisle, we're gonna do this, whichever way we have to do it - it's been her dream,' her father told KETV7. Accident: Gina, a former gymnast (pictured before her paralysis) was just 21 when she got into a car with a drunk driver, a decision that would change her life forever . Determination: But even after the accident, she refused to let it hinder her life plans. In fact, she even continued to coach gymnastics at her father Gary's gym, making the most of her upper body strength . Dream come true: When she got engaged to fiance John Springhower, she told her dad that she wanted to be able to walk down the aisle on his arm at her wedding . 'Obviously it's a dad's dream to have the honor to walk a daughter down the aisle,' he added, choking back tears. So Gina spent a year and a half training in physical therapy, where she had to teach her body how to stand up straight after spending years in a wheelchair. Then she and her father spent months practicing walking together, with Gina holding onto a crutch and wearing a brace that was designed to be hidden under her wedding dress. 'Basically my legs feel like - like when your foot wakes up from being asleep? Feels like that 24/7,' she said. Teamwork: 'I told her, whether we roll down that aisle or whether we walk down that aisle, we're gonna do this, whichever way we have to do it - it's been her dream,' her father said. They spent months practicing (pictured) Like magic: 'When you can't feel anything, and you're doing something you used to do that you used to take for granted... especially having Dad on my arm, it's a floating sensation you can't even explain' 'When you can't feel anything, and you're doing something you used to do that you used to take for granted - because I did, everybody does - when you're back up and doing it, especially having Dad on my arm, it's a floating sensation you can't even explain.' The only people who knew that Gina was planning to walk down the aisle were her family and her fiance, whose support was instrumental in helping her persevere. 'He's just that wonderful of a guy that he doesn't see the chair. He just sees me for me and forgets about how I get around,' she explained. Shock: The only people who knew that Gina was planning to walk down the aisle were her family and her fiance . Touching moment: Gina hugged her father when the reached the end of the aisle . Upright: With support from her bridesmaids, she stood while reciting her vows, smiling brightly at John . When the wedding day came on September 18, her guests gasped and watched in awe as Gina was lifted out of her wheelchair and began walking down the aisle with her father. With support, she stood while reciting her vows, smiling brightly at John. And when they were pronounced husband and wife, John swept her off her feet and carried her back down the aisle. For Gina, it's not just  physical strength that helped her achieve her dreams, but also her positive attitude. 'I look at it as I might be having a bad day, but I’m HAVING a day. I’m here. I’m having a day,' she said. Perfect match: 'He's just that wonderful of a guy that he doesn't see the chair. He just sees me for me and forgets about how I get around,' she said of John . Husband and wifeJohn kissed his bride, causing guests to break into applause . Triumphant: Then he swept her off her feet and carried her back down the aisle, both smiling happily . 'This walk down the aisle might not be what I always envisioned it would be, but we’re having a walk down the aisle. It’s happening. 'You’re here. You’re blessed. And if I can help somebody in some way to maybe look at their life a little bit differently and be blessed to have their own day, that’s why I’m having a day in my eyes.'","Gina Giaffoglione, a former gymnast from McClelland, Iowa, was involved in a car crash six years ago that left her paralyzed from the midriff down .

"On May 13 2012, during a routine fixture between Espanyol and Sevilla on the final day of the Spanish season, Mauricio Pochettino’s journey into English football began. Up in the stands, Southampton’s former chairman Nicola Cortese was on a scouting mission to watch Philippe Coutinho, who was on loan at Espanyol, with manager Nigel Adkins. There was a touchline aura about Pochettino that convinced Cortese to make further enquiries about this Argentine coach. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mauricio Pochettino confirmed as new Tottenham manager . New man in charge: Mauricio Pochettino has been named as the new manager of Spurs . When they spoke, soon after  Pochettino was fired by Espanyol in November 2012, Cortese showed him a video presentation called ‘The Southampton Way’. In it he had borrowed ideas from Barcelona’s high-tempo pressing game. Cortese wanted his aspirational Saints, just promoted to the Barclays Premier League, to adopt the same tactics. Pochettino, who is close friends with former Barcelona  defender Carles Puyol, was sold on the idea. In time there may yet be a role for the  Barcelona great at White Hart Lane. Cortese’s departure — the pair have not spoken since the executive chairman left abruptly in January —  created an excuse for Pochettino and his star players to agitate for moves elsewhere. Others want out now. Happy man: Spurs chairman Daniel Levy believes Pochettino will bring back attacking football . In April, Mino Raiola, the bellicose agent of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, touted Pochettino around France to Paris Saint-Germain, Monaco and Marseille. The Southampton manager travelled to the Parc des Princes for the Champions League quarter-final first leg against Chelsea, ostensibly on a scouting mission. Everybody knew why he was really there. Had Laurent Blanc failed to win Ligue 1, the Qatari owners of European football’s emerging superpower would have replaced him at the end of the season with Pochettino. It was a mighty close call. He earned £2m a year at St Mary’s and will earn substantially more now he has a five-year contract as Tottenham’s latest manager. Last week, when Spurs realised that their principal target Carlo Ancelotti would be staying at Real Madrid regardless of the result in the Champions League final, frantic phone calls began. The scales were delicately balanced between Frank de Boer and his four successive titles with Ajax and the credentials of up-and-coming Pochettino. Spurs executives called pretty much anyone who had ever come into contact with Pochettino as part of their due diligence. Virtually all of them said the job had come too soon in the 42-year-old’s managerial career. But Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy pressed ahead. Back then: Pochettino brings down Michael Owen in the 2002 World Cup finals . Pochettino undoubtedly has special talents, particularly his relationship with young players. The expectation is that Tottenham’s £30million record signing Erik Lamela, injured for most of last season, will respond to his compatriot’s ideas. The Argentine’s training sessions are meticulously planned and he is usually stationed in the centre of the pitch making demands of his players — in perfect English. Though Pochettino is credited with the recruitment and development of Southampton’s young stars, most of that was taken care of by Cortese and the club’s head of recruitment, Paul Mitchell. The arrival of Dejan Lovren from Lyon last summer for £7m came after one of the most sophisticated analytical checks in club history. Lovren is now worth three times that fee. The golden rule at Tottenham is to make sure you never humiliate the chairman Daniel Levy. Embarrass him by losing  6-0 at Manchester City or 5-0 at home to Liverpool (below) or three times in a season to West Ham and your job will be on the line. One of Mauricio Pochettino’s priorities is to shore up a defence that leaked 51 goals in the Premier League last season — 23 of them at White Hart Lane. He must convince poor Hugo Lloris, probably the best keeper in the division last season, to stick it out for another season. There is an issue in every area of Tottenham’s defence and Pochettino must decide whether to let Michael Dawson leave for Crystal Palace or keep him another year. Fellow Argentinian Erik Lamela, who barely played a game under Andre Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood because of an injury, must come good next season. The indications are that Lamela wants to prove himself. Up front Pochettino must get Emmanuel Adebayor, a notoriously difficult character, onside. That will not be easy.Pochettino wants to bring in Adam Lallana, but the England forward still prefers a move to Liverpool to play Champions League football. That wasn't the problem! Emmanuel Adebayor and Christian Eriksen were excellent going forward last year . Major blow: Southampton could now lose the likes of Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and James Ward-Prowse . In the manager’s office at Southampton’s Marchwood training ground, industrial-sized boxes of mate, the caffeine-rich tea that is a staple in Argentina, would be delivered to Pochettino and his staff, who drinks gallons of it. Pochettino would often invite one of his favourite players, such as left back Luke Shaw, to shoot the breeze. Shaw, a young, impressionable player, gets on brilliantly with the man who has left St Mary’s. Adam Lallana and Lovren are in the same category. But it has emerged that at Saints, there were two distinct categories of player, with the favoured few appearing to be given preferential treatment by the manager. There was evidence of this at Espanyol too, where one of his former players shone a light on the way Pochettino handled players at a club he left in November 2012. Time to go: Spurs fans were glad to see the back of Tim Sherwood as manager . ‘He wanted to control everything,’ claimed former Espanyol midfielder Moises Hurtado. ‘The first season was fine. He’d been a player and he understood, but then things changed. ‘He seemed to see conspiracy where there was none, and some good people had to leave by the back door. He wanted everyone to dance to his tune, for people to be entirely committed to him. The atmosphere ended up not being so good. But in purely sporting terms there was no problem. He got great results and we played well.’ Those who have worked with him claim Pochettino, who played at the 2002 World Cup, is high maintenance. He sulks if results go against him and was spending less time on the training field towards the end of last season. By then, this ambitious man had decided to leave Saints. It’s Spurs, as ever, who have gambled on him.","Many said the job had come too soon for Pochettino, but Daniel Levy pressed ahead .

"A door malfunction on an armored truck sent money flying everywhere on Interstate 270, prompting drivers to jump out of their cars and grab bundles of cash. The incident happened shortly before 8 a.m. on Friday morning on the northbound lanes of I-270 near Route 80, in Urbana, Maryland, but it is not known how much money was lost. The driver  had been driving in the far left lane of the interstate when a lock on a door of the Ford E-350 van malfunctioned and a huge bag of cash fell out, sending bills flying everywhere. Truck: A door malfunction on an armored truck sent money flying everywhere on Interstate 270 . Highway: The incident happened shortly before 8 a.m. on Friday morning in the northbound lanes of I-270, pictured here, near Route 80, in Maryland . Eyewitnesses saw drivers abruptly stop their cars, jump out of their vehicles, and put their hands in the air to grab the notes, police said. Soon, so many drivers had stopped their vehicles  that they practically shut down the northbound lanes of the road. However, no one was injured during the incident. The armored truck is owned by Canada-based GardaWorld. Police said the shocked truck driver pulled over to the shoulder and saw multiple vehicles had also stopped, with drivers picking up the money according to The Washington Post. But when a fire department official arrived at the scene, drivers fled onto Route 80 with money, police said. Return the cash: MD State police thanked one honest person for returning some of the money found . Greg Shipley, a spokesman with the state police said that when police officers arrived, there was practically no cash left. He told The Washington Post: ‘By the time he gets over, cash is floating through the air.' ‘Most, if not all the vehicles suddenly stopped with people’s hands raised in the air.’ ‘Traffic came to a stop when all the motorists stopped to pick up the cash,’ he said. ‘The cash was so quickly picked up by numerous motorists.’ Maryland State Police, assisted by a K-9 dog team, recovered just over $200 from the scene. Authorities have issued a warning to the drivers who grabbed the cash, urging them to turn in the money at Maryland State Police's Frederick barrack. Police tweeted a 'thank you' to one honest motorist who did, in fact, turn in some of the money that he found on the I-270. However, those who don't return the cash could face theft charges if police learn their identities, authorities said.","The incident happened shortly before 8 a.m. on Friday morning .

"An ancient Greek wine cup may be one of the earliest depictions of constellations in the night sky. That's according to a researcher who says the markings of animals on the cup actually correspond to patterns of stars. And he says that other ancient hunting scenes depicted in drawings might also be drawings of constellations. John Barnes from the University of Missouri says this ancient Greek cup depicts constellations. From left to right are seen here a bull (Taurus), snake (Hydra), rabbit or small dog (Lepus) and a larger dog (Canis Major or Canis Minor). If confirmed it would be one of the earliest records of Greek astronomy . The two-handled cup known as a skyphos is about 2,600 years old and is on display at the Lamia Archaeological Museum in Greece. It was studied by John Barnes, a classical archaeology doctoral candidate at the University of Missouri. He says this particular artefact dates back to about 600 to 625 BC. It was originally found in a pit in the 7th Century acropolis of Halai, 25 miles (40km) north of Thebes, Greece. Bull: Taurus (autumn) Snake: Hydra (winter) Rabbit: Lepus (winter) Dog: Canis Major or Canis Minor (spring) Scorpion: Scorpius (spring) Dolphin: Delphinus (summer) Lion: Leo (summer) *Note: There may be other missing constellations that also represent summer . But until now no one had considered the animals drawn on the cup could be constellations. On the cup in the image can be seen a bull, a hare or small dog and a large dog. On the other side is a scorpion, dolphin and the front half of a panther or a lion. The cup has been partially damaged though, which suggests some animals depicting constellation may still be missing. 'My dad raised me on astronomy, and to me, the snake, rabbit and dog together looked like constellations,' Mr Barnes told Live Science. 'That group jumped out at me.' While such drawings of hunting scenes are common in ancient Greece, Mr Barnes says this depiction including a dolphin with a land animal is odd. This led him to believe the drawings were showing constellations. According to Live Science, most of what we know about Greek astronomy comes from various literary texts, but they only go back to the 5th Century. This, therefore, would be one of the earliest records of Greek astronomy. In addition, Mr Barnes told MailOnline the crosses on the cup represent stars, 'which ties in quite nicely with my idea.' The two-handled cup known as a skyphos is about 2,600 years old and is on display at the Lamia Archaeological Museum in Greece. It was originally found in a pit in the 7th Century acropolis of Halai, 25 miles (40km) north of Thebes, Greece (shown in map) Mr Barnes says the findings may mean that other drawings of hunting scenes may actually be sketches of constellations. He also says the crosses on the cup are stars. From left to right here is a scorpion (Scorpius), dolphin (Delphinus) and part of a lion (Leo) While such drawings of hunting scenes are common in Ancient Greece, Mr Barnes says this depiction including a dolphin with a land animal is odd.This led him to believe the drawings were showing constellations, some of which are shown in this image . He says that aside from this and one other fragment from a similar time, 'the earliest depictions of constellations that can be reliably traced is not until 100 or 200 years after this.' The significance apart from its age means that there might be more to be found. 'Animals and figures might have been overlooked and viewed as hunting scenes or random assortments of animals,' he says. Animals are commonly attributed to certain seasons. Here Canis Major is depicted by a dog on the left, and on the right the constellation Lepus is depicted by a rabbit . 'If my proposal is correct, not just constellations but seasonal groupings, then that might suggest that they did in fact demarcate [set the boundaries] of the seasons of the year by associations with cosntellations. 'That's something we know they did later and had pretty good reason to suspect they also did in this more archaic period, but we hadn't been able to show it yet.' Most of the constellations are also not arranged in the order they appear in the sky. This suggests they may have been arranged for another purpose - possibly to define the seasons to show time throughout the year, as opposed to a calendar. The constellations in this case are separated into the four seasons in line with when they appear in the night sky. Mr Barnes' findings were detailed in the journal Hesperia.","John Barnes of the University of Missouri has sensationally claimed that drawings of what were thought to be hunting scenes may be constellations .
His findings are based on the analysis of an ancient Greek vessel .
The two-handled cup called a skyphos was found north of Thebes, Greece .
It is thought to date back to around 625 BC .
On the side it has drawings of animals that correspond to constellations .
These include a bull (Taurus), a lion (Leo) and a dolphin (Delphinus)
Mr Barnes says it is unusual for these animals to be drawn together .

Controversy: From day one of the third series, Katie showed that she was not afraid to ruffle a few feathers and the 39-year-old has remained consistent in this practice ever since. Katie forwent her place in the finals after deciding to leave the competition in the penultimate episode as she was concerned about making time for motherhood. Since her appearance on the reality show Katie has remained one of the most famously outspoken celebrities of the moment, regularly making appearances on This Morning to offer her opinion on controversial subjects including 'common' children's names and why the obese are unemployable. Katie famously embarrassed herself when she claimed that she did not like 'geographical names' when appearing on This Morning to claim that names are linked to class. Philip Schofield then pointed out that her own daughter was called India. Katie has also come head to head with several celebrities including, the late Peaches Geldof, Lily Allen and Gemma Collins. Where is she now? Katie works is carving out a career as a reality star, TV pundit and columnist. Ruth Badger (right) was a favourite to win but lost to fellow female contestant Michelle Dewberry and Katie Hopkins (left) made the decision to leave the competition to concentrate on motherhood . Ruth Badger . Age: 36 . Series: Two, 2006 . Place: Second . Remembered for... Losing out: Aside from earning herself the memorable nickname of The Badger, due to her headstrong management techniques, Ruth was mainly heralded as 'the one who should have won.' Ruth lost to her fellow female competitor Michelle Dewberry back in 2006 leaving fans of The Badger outraged and disappointed. Although The Badger did not technically win she showed that she was no loser either: her consultancy firm made £1million the same year. Ruth has since hosted her own television show, an alternative to The Dragons' Den called The Big Idea, starring herself as an expert panelist. Where is she now? Ruth is still running her own consultancy firm, Ruth Badger consultancy. Michelle Dewberry . Age: 35 . Series: Two, 2006 . Place: First . Remembered for...  An unhappy ending: Michelle successfully beat favourite Ruth Badger back in 2006 and claimed the position of Sir Alan's apprentice, but her glory was short lived. Michelle started dating  fellow contestant Syed Ahmed and fell pregnant once the show had finished. Shortly after her win Michelle stepped down from her role at Sir Alan's firm following a series of emotional and physical setbacks, including exhaustion, the unexpected pregnancy and then - sadly - a miscarriage. Where is she now? Michelle has recently beaten an ongoing battle with skin cancer and is working across several projects. Michelle Dewberry (left) tragically had to leave her position as Sir Alan's apprentice after a miscarriage and Debra Barr (right) is best known as the bad girl of series five . Debra Barr . Age: 26 . Series: Five, 2009 . Place: Third . Remembered for... Being the bad girl:  From episode one, we saw her dragged regularly (kicking and screaming) into Sir Alan's 'boardroom', hectoring her rivals, fighting her corner and making excuses when things went wrong. She was reportedly hugely unpopular with fellow Apprentice contestant, James McQuillan saying: 'She's a nightmare to work with - a pit bull.' In one of the tasks she was set - to sell a selection of tacky goods on a shopping channel - she performed so well she was accused of cheating. When she notched up huge sales of polyester ponchos, it was alleged she'd phoned her family and persuaded them to buy a consignment - something she emphatically denies. Perhaps her most shocking move was when she received a dressing down from Sir Alan after he disapproved of her treatment of Nick Hewer. Where is she now? Debra is currently working for herself as CEO of company Xcess Trading which she founded in 2011 . Stella English . Age: 34 . Series: Six, 2010 . Place: First . Remembered for... Losing it all: Before landing a £100,000 job with Lord Sugar Stella worked as a £80,000-a-year bank trader. She enjoyed a luxury lifestyle with £600 meals of lobster and caviar, £300 designer shoes and three homes reportedly worth £1million, however Stella now claims that she lost everything in a legal battle with Sir Alan. Three years after her win Stella took Sir Alan to court   at an employment tribunal. Stella claimed the prize job was a sham and that she was no more than an 'overpaid lackey'. She lost the case - since it emerged she couldn't prove that she had uttered a word of complaint about her role before resigning - and was roundly trashed by her former boss, who accused her of being a 'money-grabber' and 'not a nice person'. Where is she now? Stella is now working for Crowd Box, the world's first crowdfunding TV channel . Stella (left) attempted to sue Sir Alan after she claimed that her first prize job was all a sham and Luisa Zissman (right) has dabbled in a second round of reality TV when she appeared on celebrity big brother . Luisa Zissman . Age: 27 . Series: Nine, 2013 . Place: Second . Remembered for... Fame hunting: The 27-year-old came second to fellow female contestant Leah Totton after her pitch to open an online baking supplies company failed to win over the judges. However, this did not stop Luisa from making her name known in the business sector as well as pretty much every other industry. Since her appearance on the show Luisa has landed several modelling campaigns including those for Protein World and her own collaboration with swimwear range Pretty Pink Princess which have both seen Luisa posing in her underwear. Luisa also tried her hand at a slightly more laid back reality TV show when she joined the thirteenth series of Celebrity Big Brother where she finished fourth overall but not before revealing that she was bisexual and had been treated for a sex addiction. Where is she now? Luisa has recently become engaged to her Irish millionaire boyfriend Andrew Collins who proposed to her earlier this week in Paris. Leah won Sir Alan over and bagged first place over her competitor Luisa Zissman, despite the fact that Sir Alan wasn't initially keen on her business idea . Leah Totton . Age: 26 . Series: Nine, 2013 . Place: First . Remembered for... Convincing Lord Sugar: Leah reached the finals of last year's Apprentice with much ease, remaining a favourite to win from early on in the competition. However, at the final Luisa Zissman's online bakery almost stole the crown from under her nose after Alan Sugar seemed to take offense to Leah's pitch of a Botox clinic. When discussing a potential winner with his business aids Nick Hewer and Karren Brady Lord Sugar stated: 'As far as Leah is concerned, she doesn't look like she wants to listen. It's all very well being adamant about what you want to do but she will need to listen.' The odds looked as though they were in Luisa's favour however, Leah was determined to win and a powerful ending speech seemed enough to convince Lord Sugar. The 24-year-old said to the business mogul: 'I think I'm first of all, pitching a fantastic business opportunity, completely unique and it's extremely lucrative. 'And also, you're investing in me as a person and I genuinely think I'm a dependable, trustworthy person to invest in. And I really think that this is a fantastic opportunity for you and myself.' It wasn't long before Lord Sugar was pointing his finger at Leah. She was hired. Where is she now? Leah currently runs her own cosmetics clinic, Dr Leah, in London .","Series ten of The Apprentice kicked off last night .

"Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has not ruled out making new signings in the January transfer window. The champions look to have a serious fight on their hands to retain their Barclays Premier League crown with leaders Chelsea currently setting a ferocious pace. That might tempt City back into the transfer market at the campaign's halfway stage, as might continued involvement in the Champions League. Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has refused to rule out making new signings in January . City, who face Roma early next month, still have a chance of reaching the knockout stages of the European competition following Tuesday's stunning defeat of Bayern Munich. 'It's a thing that maybe we will talk in a few weeks more,' said Pellegrini. 'But not in this moment. We are just focused on the Premier League, focussed on the game in Rome. 'If we continue in the Champions League we will have a lot of things to think about, but you must remember we have restrictions this year - restrictions that we cannot bring in important players because we must leave them out of the squad for the Champions League. 'So we will see but I repeat that at this moment it is not the first priority to talk about. We are not thinking about that because I think it's important to trust in the squad that we have.' The restrictions Pellegrini refers to are those imposed by UEFA last summer after the club breached the European governing body's Financial Fair Play regulations. Frank Lampard's loan ends on December 30 and the club may want to replace the midfielder . City were limited to a net spend of £49million in the last transfer window and also had to limit their Champions League squad to 21 players, as opposed to the regular 25. Fear of further sanctions will limit the amount the club are prepared to spend while the squad cap leaves little room for manoeuvre. One player the club would be able to replace, however, is former England midfielder Frank Lampard, whose loan from sister club New York City is due to expire at the end of December. There has been speculation City might seek to extend the deal to compensate for Yaya Toure's likely involvement in the African Cup of Nations, but that might not stretch to the resumption of the Champions League. Pellegrini maintains that a decision on Lampard will not be taken until some time next month. Yaya Toure is due to fly off to the African Cup of Nations after Christmas which could cause problems . 'When we have to make a decision, we will make a decision,' said the Chilean. One obvious area City might wish to strengthen is up front, despite the prolific output of Sergio Aguero. Aguero has scored 17 goals this season but fellow strikers Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic have netted just seven between them. The sale of Alvaro Negredo, forced partly for Financial Fair Play reasons, has also taken away an extra option. But Pellegrini, speaking at a press conference to preview this weekend's trip to Southampton, would not be drawn on that matter. He said: 'In this moment if I say I think that maybe we are not scoring too many goals, then everyone will think that we need more players. 'But maybe we need to improve the performance of our players, the performance of the team, and that is for a lot of different reasons.' City do at least have the Premier League's top scorer in Argentine Sergio Aguero .","Manchester City are currently third in the Premier League .

"President Obama swept back into the White House after forging a diverse coalition of support from women, minorities, the young and a new powerhouse in American politics – the Hispanics. While Mitt Romney’s votes came overwhelmingly from older white voters, whose share of the electorate is diminishing, Barack Obama’s triumph was fuelled by the Hispanic vote, which is growing in numbers and influence with every election. As America’s fastest-growing demographic, it made up 10 per cent of all votes cast on Tuesday – and they backed the president in huge numbers. Scroll down for video . Voters queued in long lines to mark their ballot papers - but it was a diverse coalition of support from women, minorities, the young and Hispanics that won it for Obama . Angered by the Republican candidate’s hardline stance on immigration, Hispanics supported Mr Obama by an overwhelming 70 per cent to 30 per cent margin. In Florida, the biggest battleground prize with 29 electoral votes, Mr Romney’s failure to secure the state was blamed squarely on losing the Hispanic vote. There was no surprise that black voters backed the president by a massive majority, and his election triumph was boosted by women and younger Americans, just as it was the first time around. Divided nation . This year is likely to be the first in recent history when the majority of babies born in the US are to families from an ethnic minority background. That demographic shift is already being felt at polling stations – 72 per cent of those who cast their vote this year were white, down from 74 per cent in 2008. Matt Barreto, a political scientist at the University of Washington, said it was critical for the president to retain the Hispanic voting bloc, especially because he lost support among white men – which had declined to 36 per cent from 41 per cent four years ago. The president made a strong effort to court the estimated 24 million eligible Hispanic voters, seeking to overcome some discontent over his immigration policies. In September, he had admitted that his ‘biggest failure’ was the lack of comprehensive immigration reform, although his administration launched a programme in June to allow young undocumented immigrants to apply for temporary work permits. ‘We saw Obama’s standing among Hispanics and overall voter enthusiasm increase after his announcement this summer,’ said Mr Barreto. In sharp contrast, Mr Romney took a hard line, saying illegal immigrants should leave the country – or ‘self-deport’ –before making a bid for US citizenship. In a bid to reverse the decline in Republican support, Florida’s Hispanic Senator Marco Rubio was already being tipped yesterday as a possible presidential candidate for the party at the next election in 2016. Al Cardenas, head of the American Conservative Union and a Republican leader, said: ‘Our party needs to realise that it’s too old, too white and too male, and it needs to figure out how to catch up with the demographics of the country before it’s too late.’ William Frey, a senior demographer at the Washington-based Brookings Institution, added: ‘Even modest white support is no longer necessary for a Democratic victory, if there is strong turnout from minorities.’ Student protest .","A 'diverse coalition' of support from women, minorities and the Hispanics sees Obama re-elected for a second term .

"Neymar stole the show at the Estadio Serra Dourada on Tuesday night as the Brazil star scored a sensational free-kick to set his side up for a 4-0 friendly victory over Panama. The frontman, who was at his skilful best as he produced some sublime tricks throughout the game, made no mistake as he curled the ball into the top corner past a diving Oscar McFarlane in the Panama goal. Brazil doubled their advantage five minutes before the half-time interval courtesy of Neymar's Barcelona team-mate Dani Alves. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Highlights of Brazil 4-0 Panama . Samba star: Neymar celebrates during Brazil's friendly victory over Panama in Goiania on Tuesday evening . Pick that one out! Neymar curled a free-kick into the top corner to set Brazil on their way to victory . Powerless: Panama goalkeeper Oscar McFarlane was at full stretch but was unable to deny Neymar's strike . One for the cameras: Neymar celebrates his strike (left) and later attempts an overhead-kick (right) All smiles: Neymar (right) is congratulated by fellow frontman Fred (second left) as Oscar (left) looks on . Good call: Brazil right-back Dani Alves celebrates after doubling his country's advantage just before half-time . Easy does it: Alves gestures after finding the bottom corner of the net from outside of the area . Tidy finish: Hulk slots the ball home with the outside of his boot having been played in by Neymar's back heel . Got the moves: Hulk celebrates scoring Brazil's third goal of the game by doing the Macarena . Brazil: Cesar, Dani Alves (Maicon, 46), Luiz (Henrique, 70), Dante, Marcelo (Maxwell, 46), Ramires (Hernanes, 46), Gustavo, Oscar (Willian, 63), Fred (Jo, 61), Neymar, Hulk. Subs not used: Victor, Jefferson, Bernard. Scorer: Neymar, 27, Dani Alves, 40, Hulk 46, Willian, 73. Booked: Luiz, Neymar. Panama: McFarlane (Calderon, 58), Machado (Jimenez, 56), Carroll (Rodriguez, 67), R Torres (Cummings, 59), Gomez, Quintero, Cooper (Torres, 56), Henriquez, Munoz, Tejada (Nurse, 46). Subs not used: Parris, Chen, Barahona. Booked: Cooper, Gomez, Tejada. Referee: Raul Orozco (Bolivia) The right-back worked himself into some space  just outside the box and shot through a crowded area to find the bottom corner. Hulk extended the hosts' lead just a minute into the second-half, scoring with the outside of his right boot after latching onto Neymar's back heel. The Zenit frontman amusingly celebrated his strike by doing the Macarena. Willian, who replaced Chelsea team-mate Oscar midway through the second half, got his name on the scoresheet in the 77th minute, striking the ball into an unguarded net after Hulk's initial effort was deflected. Panama looked like they would have to play the final ten minutes with ten men when Gabriel Gomez was sent off having been deemed to have stretched and handled in the area. However, rather bizarrely, Bolivian referee Raul Orozco changed his mind and play continued. Bemused supporters in the stands were excitedly waiting for Brazil to take the resultant spot-kick but instead watched on as Panama restarted the match. Neymar's goal was the 200th of his career, and 31st with the national team. Amazingly, despite his impressive performance, the attacker feels he still has to improve for the World Cup. 'I'm still not ready. I got tired there at the end,' said Neymar. 'Little by little in practice I'm improving and getting better physically. There are still nine days left.' Beaming: Willian couldn't hide his delight after coming off the bench to score Brazil's fourth goal . Only one way to stop him: Neymar, who was at his skilful best, is fouled as four Panama players surround him . Here comes the sun: The sun beats down on the Serra Dourada Stadium as Neymar takes a throw . Control: Brazil midfielder Ramires takes charge as Panama's Alberto Quintero watches on . Middle man: Nicolas Munoz looks on as Brazil midfielder Luis Gustavo controls the ball in the centre of the park . Crowded out: Brazil striker Fred is felled and dispossessed by Panama midfielder Armando Cooper . Eyes on the prize: Hulk focuses on the ball as Panama defender Adolfo Machado races to close him down . Cool customer: Brazil captain Luiz winks at the camera as he leads his side out at the Dourada Stadium . Excited: Brazil supporters cheer on the team ahead of Tuesday friendly against Panama . Julio Cesar - 7 . Brazil's No 1 was a commanding presence throughout. Made one spectacular save, recovering from a slip to make an acrobatic leap to tip a looping header over the bar. Oscar - 5 . Looked lost positionally and was completely overshadowed by the brilliant Neymar. He wants to play behind the striker but he often ended up out on the left, with Scolari preferring to use the Barca man in the hole. His place for the World Cup opener looks under threat as he doesn't have the pace to operate out wide. Ramires - 5.5 . Struggled in the opening 15 minutes as Panama started the better of the two. Improved but was withdrawn at half-time - Brazil were much more confident on the ball with his replacement, Hernanes, but by then Panama had given up. Willian - 7 . Came on and provided much needed width, allowing Neymar more space in the middle. Scored and could be in line to start the opener if Scolari elects to play Neymar as a second striker .

"Sunderland boss Gus Poyet has ended speculation over his future by signing a new contract. The Black Cats confirmed on Wednesday evening that the 46-year-old Uruguayan, who led the club to Barclays Premier League safety at the end of last season, has put pen to paper on a deal which will keep him at the Stadium of Light until 2016. Poyet said: 'I am delighted to extend my stay with Sunderland AFC after an unbelievable season and our famous great escape.' Staying power: Gus Poyet has signed a new contract, keeping him at the Stadium of Light until 2016 . The news will come as a huge boost to both owner Ellis Short and fans on Wearside after Poyet was linked with the vacancy at Southampton following Mauricio Pochettino's departure for Tottenham. Sources close to the club had issued a hands-off warning to the Saints as bookmakers slashed the odds on his appointment, but they have now moved decisively to tie up their head coach. Former Brighton manager Poyet was appointed as Paolo Di Canio's successor in October last year on a two-year deal with the club bottom of the table and having claimed only a point from their first seven league games. However, he managed not only to keep them up, but to take them to the Capital One Cup final too, and is now planning to ensure their seemingly perennial battle against relegation becomes a thing of the past. Great escape: Sunderland survived Premier League relegation against all odds under the guidance of Poyet . Poyet - . whose backroom staff of Mauricio Taricco, Charlie Oatway, Andy Beasley . and Antonio Pintus will remain in place - said: 'Now it's a different . challenge for me and the club and I am relishing the next stage with . Sunderland. 'We achieved so much last season, working together - the club and the fans - and we took many good memories from the season. 'The . prospect of creating more of those memories is one which excites me, . and now I cannot wait for the next chapter in my career and the history . of Sunderland AFC.' Interest ended: Poyet was aleading candidate to replace Mauricio Pochettino at Southampton . Poyet, . Short and sporting director Lee Congerton have already held a series of . talks over the way forward with the head coach raising eyebrows after . suggesting that there might be something fundamentally wrong with the . club. However, . those misgivings appear to have been ironed out and rebuilding work is . under way with the club announcing hours earlier that out-of-contract . West Brom defender Billy Jones has signed a four-year deal. Congerton . said: 'We are naturally delighted that Gus has committed his long-term . future to Sunderland. Our plans are well under way in terms of summer . recruitment and we are working hard to bring new faces to the squad . ahead of the 2014-15 season.'","Gus Poyet has signed a new contract at Sunderland until 2016 .

"England's remarkably serene build-up to the World Cup includes agreeing player bonuses for Brazil with the minimum of fuss well in advance of the big kick-off. The squad are understood to be on around £350,000 each for winning the tournament, with the deal heavily incentivised for progressing through the group stage. The terms were settled last January, with Club England having set financial parameters. The smooth negotiations were helped by the current good relationship between the FA and the players’ representatives, which has not always been the case. Resolved: England have already tackled the issue of bonus money well ahead of the World Cup . This is in stark contrast to the troubles other competing teams, especially Nigeria and Cameroon, have encountered. The team, as they do for all international appearances, will donate World Cup match fees to charity. And the bonuses, despite being a hefty figure, are relatively insignificant for a squad of millionaires, with Wayne Rooney earning £300,000 a week at Manchester United. The importance of sports psychiatrist Steve Peters to England’s World Cup challenge was demonstrated by manager Roy Hodgson inviting him to sit in on the media interviews he did on Thursday, with Hodgson wanting to utilise Peters’ ‘huge brain’ as much as he can. Also present at the manager and captain media conferences were coach Gary Neville and three young players - Ross Barkley, Jon Flanagan and John Stones - though one can’t imagine Neville encouraging the trio to be helpful with the press. Guidance: Gary Neville will be Roy Hodgson's number two in Brazil . New kid on the block: Ross Barkley is one of England's Young Lions who will be hoping to have a real impact . Former football journalist Wolfgang Niersbach, president of the German football federation, has emerged as a potential UEFA candidate to take on Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency. UEFA want Blatter to face a proper opponent and Niersbach fits the bill. And the 63-year-old, with powerful federation backing, would be not be derailed by defeat. Roy Hodgson has rather less of a World Cup pedigree than the great Pele. But both are World Cup ambassadors for Swiss watchmakers Hublot, with special timepieces named after them. There’s a Hublot Classic Fusion Pele and a Hublot King Power 66 Hodgson which Roy’s son Chris, a former Hublot employee, helped design. Hodgson Snr, asked what he would rescue first if his house was on fire, nominated his watch collection. Pedigree: Roy Hodgson has World Cup experience after taking Switzerland to the USA in 1994 . More pedigree: Pele has won three World Cups, more than any other player in history . Cellino World Cup ruck . The Leeds ownership fiasco since Massimo Cellino took charge has even started to have an impact on the 2015 Rugby World Cup. The Italian, who has embarked on a heavy cost-cutting exercise, is said to be no lover of rugby union and has been questioning with ER 2015 every aspect of the contract he has inherited for two games — Italy v Canada on September 26 and Scotland v USA on September 27 — to be held at Elland Road. It’s understood Cellino wants to know what the exact cost will be for Leeds and how they will benefit, right down to the bar takings. An ER 2015 spokeswoman said: ‘We have a good working relationship with Leeds United and with Leeds City Council, who have plans to capitalise on tourism and the visitor economy through hosting two RWC games.’ Unwelcome: Massimo Cellino (right) is the unpopular new owner of Leeds United . Meanwhile beleaguered Ticketmaster, whose faulty computer system caused considerable problems for London 2012 and the Commonwealth Games, at least managed to get through the first day of their World Cup tickets sale without crashing. BBC Sport’s bizarre rules about their presenters working for other organisations somehow allowed Garry Richardson to promote bookmaking firm Unibet with Graeme Swann despite cricket’s serious match-fixing issues. Yet Jonathan Agnew is prevented from supporting Waitrose’s sponsorship of Test cricket.

"Former NFL star Larry Johnson has been arrested by police after allegedly attacking a man with a broken bottle at a hotel nightclub in the early hours of the morning. The 34-year-old, once one of the league's highest paid players, is accused of assaulting Drew Johnson after he took drinks from his table at the luxury Delano Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida. He reportedly punched the 29-year-old in the face, before breaking a bottle on the table and 'swinging it toward him', leaving him bleeding from his neck and arms. Arrest: Former NFL star Larry Johnson (pictured in his police mugshot) was today arrested by police after allegedly attacking a man with a broken bottle at a nightclub. He has been charged with aggravated battery . Former running back: The 34-year-old (pictured, left, in his mugshot, and, right, playing for the Kansas City Chiefs in 2009) is accused of assaulting 29-year-old Drew Johnson after he took drinks from his table . He then punched the victim 'a few more times' as he lay on the ground, it is alleged. Security guards eventually separated the men and Miami Beach Fire Rescue were called to the scene. The victim, a promoter who frequents the club in South Beach, was taken to a nearby hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, according to a police report obtained by TMZ. Johnson, a former running back, was charged with aggravated battery following the alleged attack at around 3am. He was booked at 7.33am and is being held on $7,500 bail. Miami-Dade County jail records did not list an attorney for him, NBC Miami reported. Scene: He reportedly punched Mr Johnson in the face at the Delano Hotel (pictured) in Miami Beach, Florida, before breaking a bottle on the table and 'swinging it toward him', leaving him bleeding from his neck . Pool: He then punched the victim 'a few more times' as he lay on the ground, it is alleged. Security guards eventually separated the men and Miami Beach Fire Rescue were called to the hotel (pictured, its pool) Johnson played in the NFL from 2003 to 2011 after starring at Penn State. His best years were with the Kansas City Chiefs, when he rushed for more than 1,700 yards in both 2005 and 2006. He ended his career with the Miami Dolphins, for whom he played just one game, and also played for the Washington Redskins and Cincinnati Bengals. It is not the first time the former player has had a run-in with the law. In 2012, Johnson was arrested at a Las Vegas resort after an ex-girlfriend told police he choked her into unconsciousness and left her in her underwear in a hotel hallway. Success: Johnson played in the NFL from 2003 to 2011 after starring at Penn State. His best years were with the Kansas City Chiefs (pictured; Johnson is no 27), when he rushed for over 1,700 yards in  2005 and 2006 . He was later sentenced to one year's probation, a $345 fine and 48 hours of community service after pleading no contest to misdemeanor domestic violence battery and assault. A felony charge was dropped as part of the plea deal, it was reported at the time. In 2008, Johnson was accused of spitting and threatening to kill a woman in a Kansas City nightclub.","Larry Johnson, 34, allegedly attacked Drew Johnson, 29, at hotel nightclub .

The experiment revolved around an online game called Hooked on Music. It was developed by the Museum of Science and Industry (Mosi) and formed part of a study examining what makes a song memorable. In it, players were asked to identify a song as quickly as possible, from 1,000 clips dating from the 1940s to the present day. Wannabe took an average of 2.29 seconds for a participant to recognise its catchiest hook, which is ‘if you wanna be my lover’ and occurs 45 seconds into the track. Lou Bega’s Mambo Number Five and Survivor’s Eye of the Tiger, were named the second and third catchiest tunes and were recognised in an average of 2.48 seconds and 2.62 seconds respectively, it was revealed at the Manchester Science Festival. This video shows the top 10 catchiest songs, as recognised in the online experiment. In it, players were asked to identify a song as quickly as possible, from 1,000 clips dating from the 1940s to the present day . The average time it took for participants to recognise a song across all the best-selling clips was just five seconds. The study suggests that spending weeks at number one or selling ‘double platinum’ doesn't mean a tune will be catchy in the long-term. Scientists think a catchy song has to strike a balance between prominent hooks and other musical features. Ashley Burgoyne, a computational musicologist from the University of Amsterdam, Netherlands who led the study, explained: ‘All of the tracks we examined are among the best-known pop tracks in the UK, and none of them showed extreme differences in recognisability between their hooks and their least-catchy moments: no more than 30 per cent of what would theoretically be possible. ‘But given that constraint, the catchiest songs also showed the greatest differences in recognisability between their hooks and their verses or bridges.’ Dr Burgoyne is fascinated by how the brain processes music and why some tunes are more memorable than others. Having analysed how memorable segments of the songs are, he will now look at the precise music devices that make them so catchy. ‘Although this is just a casual observation on my part, very strong melodic hooks seem to be the most memorable for people,’ he told the BBC. The game will remain online and can be played until the end of this year. Dr Burgoyne hopes that from it, scientists may gain a better understanding of how musical memory works, which could one day be used to help people with dementia. ‘There has already been some research that shows that if you can find the right piece of music, something that had a very strong meaning, playing that piece of music can be very therapeutic. But the challenge is figuring out what is the best piece of music,’ he said. Lou Bega’s Mambo Number Five ( artwork from the single is shown) and Survivor’s Eye of the Tiger, were named the second and third catchiest tunes and were recognised in an average of 2.48 seconds and 2.62 seconds respectively, it was revealed at the Manchester Science Festival .","Wannabe was named the catchiest song in an online experiment, followed by Lou Bega's Mambo Number Five and Survivor's Eye of the Tiger .

"A six-year-old boy has been left orphaned after his parents and seven-month-old sister all died in a car crash as they made their way to a church retreat in Oregon. Tiffany Fefelov, 27, was driving her husband Fred, 34, and their daughter Mila on U.S. 20 Saturday morning when she lost control of their Dodge Caliber on the wet road, the Oregon State Police said. The vehicle crossed into oncoming traffic and smashed head-on into a 2001 Chevy Suburban towing a 32-foot trailer. The couple inside the SUV were unharmed but the Fefelovs  all died. The Fefelovs' six-year-old son Ewan was staying with a relative at the time. Tiffany's large family - she was the oldest of seven children - now plan to raise the boy. Torn apart: Tiffany and Fred Fefelov and their seven-month-old daughter Mila, left, were killed in a car crash in Oregon on Saturday. Their six-year-old son Ewan, right, was staying with relatives at the time . Devastating: The young family was devoted to their church and each other, Tiffany's relatives said . 'Everybody's just very devastated for their son and what's going to happen to him,' their pastor Ricky Challinor told KOIN6. 'His entire life changed in one day. He lost his immediate family. I can't even imagine what that would be like.' The family, from Tigard, were heading to a church retreat hosted in Deschutes County by the Portland International Christian Church when the crash occurred at 10am on Saturday. Challinor said several people tried calling the couple throughout the day to find out where they were but they received a call from Tiffany's mother with the devastating news later that afternoon. 'It didn't even seem real,' Challinor told the Oregonian. 'My heart sank.' The couple had been part of the church for at least two years and helped lead its marriage ministry, providing a source of encouragement for other couples, Challinor said. Loving: Tiffany, a registered nurse, was a doting mother to baby Mila, pictured, and her son, family said . Happy: They led their church's marriage ministry and were a source of encouragement for other couples . Doting: Fred, a maintenance manager at an assisted living facility, had a great sense of humor, relatives said . 'They were a friendly face that a lot of people here knew,' he said. 'They touched a lot of people's lives, and this is a tremendous loss for all of us.' A relative of Tiffany's who worked with Fred at a Space Age gas station had introduced the pair, and they quickly began dating. They would have celebrated their fourth wedding anniversary in March. 'Tiffany, Fred and Mila were such a huge part of this family,' Tiffany's sister-in-law Rachelle Burgess said. 'Now they're gone, and it's so sudden. The loss here is absolutely devastating.' Family members told the Oregonian that Fred, who was born in Alaska before moving to Oregon to study art, would be remembered for his boisterous sense of humor and thankful, humble nature. The dad worked in Afghanistan as a contract field service technician and was employed as a maintenance manager at an assisted living facility at the time of his death, the newspaper reported. Tiffany was a licensed practical nurse and would be remembered as devoted and caring, while their baby daughter was good-natured and always a delight, family said. Crash: Mrs Fefelov lost control of their car on a wet road and hurtled towards oncoming traffic, smashing head-on with this SUV pulling a trailer. The Fefelovs all died but the couple in the SUV were not harmed . A Gofundme memorial fund has been sent up for the family and a memorial will be held next Sunday at the DoubleTree Hotel in Portland. 'Everyone that knew Tiffany and Fred knew they shared their contagious laughter, loving nature and generosity for all those around them,' their memorial page reads. 'They loved to celebrate all that life has blessed them with each and every day. 'The family is beyond devastated and at a loss for words to express their extreme sadness of the loss of such a beautiful family.'","Tiffany Fefelov, 27, was driving husband Fred, 34, and daughter Mila, seven months, on U.S. 20 on Saturday when she lost control on the wet road .

"When the Manchester United playing squad first heard of the club’s interest in Louis van Gaal last month, the reaction was not universally positive. Good enough reason to suggest, therefore, that the 62-year-old Dutch coach may transpire to be exactly the right choice. Time will tell. A year ago, there were not many dissenting voices in and around football following the appointment of David Moyes. Many commentators who criticise that choice now were happy to declare themselves in favour at the time. What is clear, however, is that United’s playing squad now need a firm hand. They need to realise, and quickly, that, contrary to what they may presume, their voices are not the most important ones at Britain’s biggest football club. New man in charge: Louis van Gaal will take over at Manchester United after the World Cup . Moyes, it transpired, couldn’t hold on tight enough to a group of players unsettled and unnerved by the presence in their midst of anyone other than Sir Alex Ferguson and his familiar band of coaches. For Van Gaal, we should presume that will not be a problem. He has a reputation for being forthright, positive and free of self-doubt. He will need to be all of these things as he looks to restore the proper order of things at Old Trafford and, further down the road, tries to restore United to their accustomed place at the top of the Barclays Premier League. For United, this is Life after Ferguson Part II. This is the bit that they really have to get right. One bad appointment is a nuisance. Two, however, starts to chip away at reputation, at standing and at prospects. Moyes was an appointment for the . long-term and it didn’t work simply because he couldn’t get the . short-term part right. Van Gaal, sticking to that theme, is perhaps a . man for the mid-term, a coach who must guide United over a bump in the . road that has grown an awful lot bigger over the last few months. Getting the team together: Van Gaal will be chared with getting the United players pulling in the same direction . Cups of joy: Van Gaal has a habit of winning trophies in his career at Ajax and Barcelona . The second coming? Van Gaal's reign is set to be like Ferguson's in terms of the respect that he commands . Van Gaal’s record shows that he doesn’t tend to stay in one place for too long. After almost a decade at Ajax, he did three years at Barcelona, two with Holland, another with Barcelona, four at AZ Alkmaar and two at Bayern Munich. From that point of view, the three-year contract handed him by the Glazer family feels about right. Ideally, United may have liked a younger man. At Old Trafford, though, priorities have changed dramatically since last summer. United are a club that cannot afford to slip any further behind Manchester City and Chelsea. Currently they are no longer even in . their rivals’ slipstream and Van Gaal’s appointment – as strange as it . sounds – is just as much about moving United forwards again, about . arresting decline, as much as it is about winning the Premier League . next season. Van Gaal, in many ways, is a safe option and the Dutch coach arrives to find a squad in dire need of an overhaul. Getting it right: Ed Woodward played a key role in the appointment of Van Gaal . United won the Premier League just a year ago but suddenly theirs is a squad short of at least two new central defenders and maybe two left backs. It also needs at least one central midfield player, one wide player and maybe a centre forward. United chief executive Ed Woodward has been talking big in terms of projected spending. Once Van Gaal takes proper stock, however, Woodward may find that even £150m begins to look rather conservative. Currently, United appear to be stuck a . little between the old regime and the new in terms of transfer targets. Woodward had hoped that the list of players put together by Moyes would . withstand the scrutiny of the new manager. The wrong one: David Moyes' appointment was a mistake - although there were not too many dissenting voices at the time . Plenty to work on: The United squad will be expected to do better than last season . That, of course, was always unlikely and currently the club’s stated aim of doing most of their business before the World Cup looks startlingly unrealistic. Van Gaal is now on the cusp of a World Cup campaign with Holland and will not be seen at Old Trafford until the middle of July. As such, the synergy between him and his chief executive is going to be a damn sight better than that between Woodward and Moyes if United’s squad is going to be competitive by the start of next season. In the background, meanwhile, lurks Ryan Giggs. Van . Gaal’s decision to give Giggs a key role on his staff represents the . safe option and something of a risk all at the same time. It gives the . new United manager a link between himself and his dressing room already . as well as insight in to how the club works and what it expects, on and . off the field. A good link: Keeping Ryan Giggs as his No 2 will give him a link to the playing squad . A pipe dream: Giggs and his fellow Class of 92 teammates Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and Phil Neville would never have worked at this time . Should things not start well for Van Gaal, though, he may find that the man next to him in the dugout begins to represent a threat – at least in terms of the public’s perception – as much as anything else. There is a faction among the United support – romantic fools that they are - that would have liked to see Giggs and his former team-mates – the so-called ‘Class of 92’ – given the job. Management by collective, so to speak. That would never have worked. A club needs a manager, a figurehead, a leader. The man United have chosen certainly has broad enough shoulders to cope. Woodward and the Glazer family must hope he has the flexibility and the wherewithal to adapt to the Premier League, too. Another poor appointment and United could find themselves adrift.

"A computer programme has been used to predict how people are feeling when they type. In a study participants were asked to type a particular phrase and the programme then estimated if they were happy, sad and so on. Remarkably it was correct 70 per cent of the time, and the findings could lead to smarter artificial intelligence in the future. Islamic University of Technology in Bangladesh researchers studied typing. They found that the way a person types can reveal how they are feeling (stock image shown). In the study 25 people were asked to write a section of a book. A computer programme then predicted with 70 per cent accuracy how they were feeling . The study published in the journal Behaviour and Information Technology was carried out by researchers at the Islamic University of Technology in Bangladesh, reports Live Science. In the research 25 people ranging from 15 to 40 years old were asked to retype two paragraphs from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll. They also had to enter their emotional state every 30 minutes while doing their regular activities on the computer. Researchers have revealed exactly what mobile phone users type most - and say that 'I love you' is the most popular three word sentence. The team at SwiftKey analysed web data along with anonymous data from their hugely popular alternative keyboard, which has been downloaded to more than 100 million devices, and also found phone users are extremely polite. The single most commonly used one word sentence in English is 'thanks' and the most popular two word phrase is 'thank you'. This allowed the programme an opportunity to understand how their emotions changed their typing style. Moods tested were joy, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, shame and guilt. The result was that the programme could identify a person's mood correctly 70 per cent of the time. It was most successful in identifying joyfulness with an 87 per cent success rating, while sadness was the least accurate at 60 per cent. The researchers noted that the participants were less likely to input data when they were in a bad mood, which may explain the inaccuracy of the latter result. Joy was predicted successfully most often and least successful was sadness. The researchers say this could lead to smarter artificial intelligence in future that can make suggestions to us based on how we are typing at that moment in time (stock image shown) However the findings could have important implications for artificial intelligence, and it may allow computers to engage with us in a more friendly manner. 'If we could build any system that is intelligent enough to interact with humans that involves emotions - that is, it can detect user emotions and change its behavior accordingly - then using machines could be more effective and friendly,' the researchers wrote. For example, this could enable pop-up ads to be tailored to how you are feeling at the moment. Or, when looking for a movie on Netflix, perhaps an algorithm could make suggestions for films that would match your mood.","Islamic University of Technology in Bangladesh researchers studied typing .

"Click here for Sportsmail's brilliant Match Zone from West Ham v Aston Villa . One run has ended and another continued, but only Paul Lambert had cause to smile about this result. Sam Allardyce was far more preoccupied with how this one got away, even if it did mean West Ham have now gone five matches unbeaten in this excellent season of personal vindication. Make no mistake, this game was there for the taking for a free-scoring team who suddenly got the jitters in front of goal. Never was that more obvious than in the frenzied late stages of the second half. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: West Ham United vs Aston Villa .

Diafra Sakho, the Premier League player of the month for October, was guilty of one woeful header, Carl Jenkinson of another. When Andy Carroll  came on in stoppage time for his first appearance of the season, he caused mayhem in the air. Of course he did. What an asset he could be in this attack if his fitness holds up, but even his headers could find no way past Brad Guzan. ‘The sad thing is that when our finishing was very good their goalkeeper was even better,’ Allardyce said. ‘Other times I was a little disappointed with the finishing, given how good it has been. We are a little frustrated and disappointed, but we couldn’t do any more. We have to respect the point.’ A point flattered Aston Villa and delighted Lambert, their manager. Six defeats in a row was their worst top-flight run since 1964. At least that streak has gone, even if the hard times show no obvious sign of ending. ‘It was a really great point,’ Lambert said. ‘Brad Guzan did what he is paid for. His save at the end was world class. He’s a top guy, a top pro. ‘We put our bodies on the line and it is a massive point for us. Credit to the team, they took a lot of stick at times.’ Indeed, it really has been a tough season for them, even if Lambert insisted confidence is good. He also felt Villa ‘looked a threat’ but in truth they were largely blunt, as they have been for much of the season. A return of five goals from 11 games is dire. The harsh suspension picked up by Christian Benteke against Tottenham last week didn’t help, and the lack of accuracy early on by his replacement, Gabriel Agbonlahor, made matters worse. To the striker’s credit, he created the 12th-minute opening that should have put Villa in front. But having sped past James Collins to go clear, his shot was hopelessly high. Who knows how significant those moments could be in the course of a season? West Ham United players observe a Rememberance Day silence prior to the match against Aston Villa at Upton Park .

Tom Cleverley               90          10.8      6.7 . From there it was often an unrewarded West Ham blitz. Collins almost atoned for his flat-footed defending with a header that Guzan did well to save. And Sakho then headed wide from an Aaron Cresswell cross. Stewart Downing, meanwhile, followed his England call-up with another impressive performance. Set-pieces, runs from deep, long passes and fine crosses — at 30 he is having a fine late-career revival. He forced a save from Guzan after 24 minutes and moments later retreated deep into his own half to thread a 50-yard pass through a crowd and into Cresswell’s path. He closed the half with a poor shot, but that was the only blot on a day when the quality of his deliveries was sublime. Allardyce said: ‘I think people forget how exciting it is to see crossing and heading.’ And Villa? Andreas Weimann shot straight at Adrian from a good position, but the sad truth is that their nearest miss came when Winston Reid overhit a backpass and Adrian’s touch let the ball run close to the line. Villa looked tighter at the back in the initial stages of the second half but were battered in the final 15 minutes. Somehow Guzan was able to make the saves that kept them from conceding. Sakho’s 78th-minute miss was the worst. Carlton Cole’s delivery was perfect but Sakho’s free header wasn’t even on target. Sakho missed a second header soon after and Jenkinson’s attempt went straight to Guzan. With that, Carroll was sent on in stoppage time. He is often maligned but his gifts are obvious. Twice he beat a swarm of markers to meet Downing crosses. Twice Guzan denied him. Carroll needs a run of games; Villa will simply be pleased to have ended their run of defeats.

"These spooky pictures which appear to show spirits hovering ominously over the heads of the living have gone on display for the first time in the Titanic Quarter in Belfast. They have been released just in time for Halloween by the Public Record Office Northern Ireland (PRONI) and all feature a Lieutenant Colonel E J Gordon Tucker after being found in his records. Taken shortly after the First World War the pictures were taken at a time when many people wanted to contact loved ones who had died in the conflict. Lieutenant Colonel E J Gordon Tucker and his companions are pictured after taking part in what is believed to have been a séance. They all seem unaware of the presence of a veiled woman leaning ominously over them . Lieutenant Colonel Tucker was a retired army officer who served in India and was a keen spiritualist . From the UK alone more than 700,000 men died during the Great War - and many families never had the chance to say goodbye. Spiritualism and communing with the dead experienced a massive surge in popularity - and had an unlikely champion. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes, turned to spiritualism following the death of his son Kingsley in 1918. He sank into a deep depression and like many grieving parents he was desperate to speak with his son - something spiritualism offered. He became a vocal supporter of  spiritualism following the war and remained one for the rest of his life. Although the exact method used to create the images pictured is unknown, it is believed the ghostly apparitions were actually man-made using double exposure or by creating a 'spirit-like' mannequin. Catherine Millar, from the PRONI, said: 'Unfortunately we don't know how the spirits appeared. We will have to leave it to everyone's imagination. A ghostly apparition appears to engulf Lieutenant Colonel Tucker in this picture -  but he seems unperturbed . 'These images are in the context of a huge surge of interest in spiritualism after the First World War. Lieutenant Colonel Tucker was a retired army officer who served in India and a keen spiritualist. 'Lieutenant Tucker came from Oxford and it appears he had relatives in Ireland. The photographs appear to show Lt Col Tucker and companions and images of 'spirits' possibly after a séance. 'Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes, devoted his life to spiritualism after the death of his brother and son during the Great War, although paradoxically Sherlock Holmes frowned upon such practices and solved crimes with the power of the mind.' Alan Robertson, from the PRONI, said: 'These photographs show 'spiritualist manifestations' surrounding people who were involved in a séance. 'They appear as 'faces' surrounded by white mist known as 'ectoplasm'. 'Many people had lost family members in the First World War without having the opportunity to say goodbye. 'During the 1920s and 1930s, some sought comfort by trying to contact their missing loved ones through their belief in spiritualism.'","Ghostly images  released just in time for Halloween after being discovered .

"Andy Murray revealed he was enjoying a Sunday afternoon on the sofa playing Mario Kart when he got the call to replace the injured Roger Federer for an impromptu ATP World Tour exhibition match. A mammoth final between Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic was cancelled after the Swiss star claimed he wasn't 'match fit' to take part following a grueling semi-final clash against Stan Wawrinka on Saturday night. To the delight of the London crowd, Murray dutifully agreed to take part in a one-set exhibition match against the Djokovic, but was unable to overcome the Serb, going down 5-8.

'I've known him for a long time and I would say he and Rafa (Nadal) are the biggest competitors, guys who always give 100 per cent, so I'm sure, if he could have come out and played, he would have done.

"Roger Federer has pulled out of Sunday night's final of the ATP World Finals at the 02 Arena against Novak Djokovic. The world No 2, who in the past has had back problems, is said to have felt very stiff following Saturday night's epic semi-final against compatriot Stan Wawrinka, which took two hours and 48 minutes to complete. Federer showed class in coming out onto the court to apologise in person to the crowd for his absence, although he was not specific about  the exact cause of his problem. 'I tried everything, rest, massage but I am not match fit,' he said. 'At this level I could not compete. It would be too risky to do it at my age now.

The crowd took the bad news relatively well and organisers said ticket holders would be contacted. To ensure a night of entertainment, British No 1 Andy Murray agreed to take on Djokovic in an exhibition match followed by a doubles match between Murray and John McEnroe against Tim Henman and Pat Cash. Federer did not finish his media duties until 1am after his win over Wawrinka and is said not to have left his central London hotel until 3.30pm on Sunday afternoon ahead of what was scheduled to be a 6pm final. The ATP, promoters of the year-end finale that has daily crowds in excess of 17,500, looked set to confirm that Federer was pulling out amid reports from good sources that a singles exhibition match and doubles exhibition might replace what was meant to be his showdown against Djokovic. Aside from the blow to fans, the news is worrying for Switzerland's Davis Cup team, who are due to play against France in the final over next weekend.

"More than 1,200 weapons, including firearms and Taser stun guns, were confiscated from New York schoolchildren last year, police have revealed. Knives were the most common weapons seized from students during the 2013/14 academic year, including razor blades and fold-up knives disguised as credit cards, figures released by the New York Police Department showed. But officers also took nine guns and 44 BB airguns which can fire pellets at a velocity of between 275 to 350 feet-per-second - about half that of a .25 caliber handgun. Metal detected: Around 42 per cent of the weapons were recovered after tip-offs from staff or students while 712, 58 per cent, were picked up by metal detectors at school gates . Around 42 per cent of the weapons were recovered after tip-offs from staff or students while 712, 58 per cent, were picked up by metal detectors at school gates, reported the New York Post, which published the figures. Police told the newspaper that children do not bring weapons to school because they intend to do harm, rather they arm themselves as a form of protection in dangerous neighbourhoods. 'They just feel safe having a weapon in their possession,' Inspector Charles Mc-Evoy, executive officer of the School Safety Division. The use of metal detectors in schools has long been a source of controversy. Knife: Knives were the most common weapons seized from students during the 2013/14 academic year, including razor blades and fold-up knives, figures released by the New York Police Department showed . Critics argue that strict disciplinary practices, including police presence, metal detectors and 'zero tolerance' policies criminalize students, making them less likely to graduate and more likely to end up ensnared in the criminal justice system. But advocates say they are necessary to keep children safe from each other as petty rivalries spawned within gang culture continue to blight many inner-city schools. 'The things you find throughout the year, my God,' one Bronx high-school principal who wished to remain anonymous told the NYP. 'If you're pulling ten to 20 objects a week, that's ten to 20 possible injuries prevented.' School-safety agents at DeWitt Clinton HS in The Bronx told The Post that many girls who carry weapons hide them in their bras, assuming the underwire will throw off the metal detectors. Another boy, they said hollowed out a school textbook in which to conceal a weapon.","Knives were the most common weapons seized from students last year .

"Bacary Sagna is expected to arrive at Manchester City on Monday to hold formal talks with the Barclays Premier League champions. Just hours after attending Arsenal's trophy parade on the streets of Islington following their FA Cup final win over Hull, the France international could conclude his anticipated deal to City later on Monday. Sportsmail revealed on Friday how Sagna would hold formal discussions with City chiefs this week. On his way: Bacary Sagna, taking a selfie during Arsenal's trophy parade on Sunday is set to join Man City . Sagna meets up with France's World Cup party later this week and wants his future decided before the tournament to ensure he heads to Brazil with a clear head. If everything goes according to plan, the right-back could even undergo his City medical on Monday ahead of agreeing to join Manuel Pellegrini's men. It is understood Sagna will be offered a three-year deal worth around £150,000-per-week during today's discussions. Final act: The Frenchman is held aloft by Olivier Giroud and Nacho Monreal before celebrating Arsenal's FA Cup triumph with team-mate Jack Wilshere at Wembley . City look to have fought off late interest in Sagna from arch-rivals Manchester United. Incoming Old Trafford boss Louis van Gaal wanted to hijack Pellegrini's move for Sagna having identified the right-back position as one he wants to strengthen. But City's move for the Frenchman was already at an advanced stage and barring a collapse in negotiations, the Frenchman should become the Etihad Stadium club's first summer signing. The news has been expected for sometime, with Sagna rejecting three contract extensions at Arsenal - the last one a three-year £80,000-per-week deal. Gesture: Arsenal fans are keen for Sagna to stay, but it looks as though he's played his final game for the club . But the fact he looks set to become the latest Gunner to join City - following in the footsteps of Emmanuel Adebayor, Kolot Toure, Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy - will come as a major blow to Arsenal. Arsenal fans at yesterday's parade made their feeling regarding Sagna crystal clear as they sang: 'We want you to stay'. However, Sagna's anger at the way his contract situation has been handled by Arsenal has played an integral role in his decision to quit the club.","Bacary Sagna, out of contract this summer, was offered £80,000 by Arsenal .

"A stunning video of professional skiers wearing  custom-made LED suits as they glide down  mountain slopes looks set to show the sport in a completely new light. The film, shot in Alaska, shows world class skiers wearing incredible LED suits as they perform spectacular stunts  down pristine snowy slopes at night. The 12 minute film called Afterglow was shot by a team from Sweetgrass Productions and  released on the website Vimeo, according to Wired. Scroll down for video . Stunning: The feature length film was filmed in Alaska and shows world class skiers wearing incredible custom-made LED suits as they glide down pristine snowy slopes at night . Skiers: Pep Fujas and Eric Hjorleifson, two of the best skiers in the world took on the daunting task . It was created by a team led by co-director Nick Waggoner who said that they all wanted to shake up the genre of skiing films as it had become stale. The team used the dazzling effects of the colored lights which reflected off the snow, lighting up the darkness to create stunning scenes. Skiers Pep Fujas and Eric Hjorleifson, two of the best skiers in the world took on the daunting task of skiing down the rugged Alaskan terrain and found it difficult during the night shoot. They filmed during the day and  worked mostly at night, draping the skiers in giant light suits and hauled gigantic, high-powered lights into the backcountry and lit up entire mountains as a backdrop. ‘Deep pillows and Alaskan spines, all filmed at night, with massive lights, custom made LED suits, and a national governments worth of logistics, planning, and civil engineering,’ said the filmmakers. And it is unlike anything seen before. The creative team had to take care of the LED suits, which had 7,000 LEDs sewn onto each skiers’ gear. Dazzling: The effects of the coloured light reflecting off the snow  is simply stunning in the footage . Vivid: They filmed during the day and worked mostly at night and lit up entire mountains as a backdrop . Lights: The creative team had to take care of the LED suits, which had 7,000 LEDs sewn onto each skiers’ gear . Slope: The team  used eight 4,000-watt lights, accented with smaller lights and gels to add contrast and fill . Often, some of the lights would burn out  bringing filming to a halt while repairs were made. And the team faced other challenges whilst navigating the snow covered mountains. It proved to be a difficult task as the snow occasionally blew and billowed up around them creating conditions which are similar to  driving with your bright lights on in a snowstorm. ‘A couple times the skiers were like, ‘Holy shit, that was scary,’ Waggoner said. However, unperturbed, the team lit up entire mountains and used eight 4,000-watt lights, accented with smaller lights and gels to add contrast and fill. The lighting and filming gear—which included several RED EPIC cameras and an octocopter—weighed 9,000 pounds. The ambitious crew got the equipment  up the mountain in a helicopter, but there were also times when it was loaded into sleds and hauled up by hand. They needed five airplanes to haul everything in. ‘We wanted to do whatever we could to push the visual envelope,’ Waggoner said. i . They split filming into different segments, capturing the tree segments  in British Columbia in late March, and  steep skiing,  in mountains of the Alaskan Range in April. Most of the filming took place at the Golden Alpine Holidays Sentry Lodge, Alyeska Resort, and the Alaskan Wilderness. Now, Waggoner  hopes Afterglow will change the way that  ski films are seen. ‘We had a pretty crazy dream and I’m just glad we had the means to realize it,’ he said.","The stunning footage was shot in Alaska and British Columbia .

"Ernests Gulbis has been caught in a sexism row after admitting that he doesn't want his sisters to become tennis players as women 'need to think about kids'. The Latvian star has become better known for his controversial views than his performances on court in recent years but his latest outburst has shocked those both in and outside the world of professional tennis. Addressing the subject of his younger sisters following in his footsteps, Gulbis said: 'Hopefully they will not pursue professional tennis careers. Hopefully. Because for a woman, it's tough. Controversial: Ernests Gulbis says women need to 'think about kids' instead of getting into professional tennis . Best quote: Ernests Gulbis misunderstood and thought a question was about vampires... 'I . wouldn't like my sisters to become professional tennis players. It's a . tough choice of life. A woman needs to enjoy life a little bit more. Needs to think about family, needs to think about kids.' Gulbis' comments have provoked outrage on social media and he is unlikely to emerge from the incident without at least being questioned about his views on women in sport. The 25-year-old was speaking after ending a six-year wait to reach the fourth round of a grand slam by setting up a mouth-watering clash with Roger Federer in Paris. Remarkably considering his enormous talent, Gulbis had lost in either the first or second round in 20 of his last 21 slams since reaching the quarter-finals of the French Open as a 19-year-old in 2008. Gulbis is at least making headlines for his tennis as well these days. He has won two titles this season, most recently last weekend in Nice, and is at a career-high ranking of 17. Gulbis is the first to admit he only has himself to blame for not making the most of his talent earlier in his career. Next up: Gulbis says he has a plan to face Roger Federer in the next round at Roland Garros in Paris . He said: 'I'm jumping on the last train. I'm 25, so this was my last opportunity to be really successful, I think, and I think I have a good seven, eight more years to play at the top level.' At the start of last year Gulbis was ranked outside the top 130 and his rise since has been swift.Gulbis felt he needed to go through the tough times, though, saying: 'I don't regret it at all, because I think in a way I'm in a better position. 'Maybe not as a tennis player but as a person. Because I have been through ups and downs. 'Most of the guys who are on top now, they haven't been down a lot. They haven't gone back from playing quarter-finals of a grand slam to asking for a wild card in a Challenger and not getting it, playing qualifying in a Challenger. Room for improvement: Gulbis is hoping to reignite his career after winning two titles this season . 'And the attitude, how it changes a lot, from everybody. And I saw it. So now nothing can really blur my mind and my vision. I'm not going to be now suddenly friends with everybody.' Federer and Gulbis have played three times before, all in 2010 and all of them close, with the Swiss winning twice. Gulbis said: 'I have a game plan. I know how I'm going to play him. 'You don't need to be scared to do certain things against him, because most of the people, they go on the court and they lose already the match before it has started. I can tell you that's not going to be the case with me.'","Gulbis believes professional tennis is 'a tough choice of life' for women .

FEMAIL were keen to discover the secrets behind Millie's beauty look so we chatted to her new favourite make-up artist, Nikki Wolff, who created the star's look last night. Scroll down for video . Get the look: Last night at the Harper's Bazaar Women Of The Year Awards in London, Millie Mackintosh looked flawless. FEMAIL chatted to her make-up artist to get the secrets behind her look . Millie, a trained make-up artist herself, knows a good beauty buff when she sees one. The pair were introduced via mutual friend, Zara Martin. 'I was doing Zara's makeup for a shoot and she posted a picture of her look on Instagram. Millie spotted it and asked her who did her make-up and then we were introduced and have been working together ever since. Millie calls me as and when she needs her make-up doing now.' Nikki, who is also Jessica Ennis' make-up artist and works with Amanda Holden, wanted to create a really fresh, nude look on the star. 'Her Julien Macdonald dress was beautiful so we wanted to create a natural look to go with it,' she explained. Millie is a postergirl for the healthy lifestyle she preaches - and Nikki says she can credit it for her glowing skin. Au natural: Millie wore a dazzling Julien Macdonald dress at last night's event and Nikki wanted to create a fresh beauty look to complement it . 'Millie eats really well and exercises a lot, which really shows in her skin. I didn't want to mask her face with make-up but simply enhance her skin.' Nikki prepared Millie's face with a Sisley face mask to hydrate it, followed by an Illamasqua skin base buffed in to create a 'second skin'. Nikki used cream blusher because she believes it gives a glow from within rather than a cakey look. She followed this with a swish of highlighter (and no bronzer). 'Millie already has lovely glowing skin from her recent holiday so she didn't need any help,' she said. Her natural peachy lips were created thanks to a chunky lip liner smudged over her lips with a slick of balm on top. 'I love using a liner as a lipstick or using it under a lipstick, which really makes it last longer,' said Nikki. Hot couple: Millie arrived at the bash with husband Professor Green, who couldn't keep his eyes off her all night . For her eyes, the beauty guru used a soft brown kohl and completed the look with a set of lashes from Millie's eponymous range.

'I have to be fair to Stephen, and so I keep it organised and out of the way, under our bed in pull out drawers – face, lips, and lashes,' she explained. Keen to build up her brand, Millie is considering venturing into beauty. 'I love discovering the next big thing in beauty and I am definitely looking into it but I'm so busy at the moment.

"At first glance, this breathtaking shot looks like two brightly coloured flowers pictured next to each other. In fact, the photo is of a flower and a beautifully coloured hummingbird hovering beside it. With its wings outstretched, at first glance it's almost impossible to tell the little bird is different from the flower. The only give-away is its small, thin, bill that peaks through its wings. The picture appears to be of two flowers, but one is a brightly coloured hummingbird hovering in the air . The brightly coloured hummingbird was photographed sweeping down onto the pink flower so it could feed off its nectar. But while feeding peacefully, another bird invades and tries to get some of the nectar. After a few moments as the two birds sized each other up, the intruder decided to leave. The spectacular photos were taken by photographer Florian Kuster on the slopes of a volcano in Costa Rica. Mr Kuster visited the Poas Volcano National Park, which is home to the volcano, to scout for locations good enough for his photo tours. The 32-year-old, who is from Switzerland but lives in Costa Rica, drove for an hour on a narrow mountain road before finding the hummingbirds. He said: 'I went there for location scouting for my photography workshops. I drove for one hour on a bumpy, narrow mountain pass. 'I enjoyed a beautiful landscape and cold winds at the highest elevation, rain and heavy clouds are guests all year round and give the region a mystic atmosphere. 'Rufous-tailed hummingbirds are about 10cm from bill to tail. The flower about the size of a small honeydew melon. After hovering above it for some time, the hummingbird lands on the flower to try and look for nectar . It then starts digging through the flower petals to try and find some food. The birds can consume up to twice their body weight in nectar every day . Before long, it is interrupted by a second hummingbird which hopes to join in the feast . The two birds then have a brief confrontation as they fight over the rights to the flower's nectar . After the brief spat, the intruder decides to leave and the first hummingbird returns to its meal . 'Being from Switzerland I was not familiar with hummingbirds until my first journey to the American continent. 'Since then I was fascinated by this little helicopters designed by nature. Their ability to stand still in the air and accelerate within a blink of an eye to 100km/h is aviational design in it's perfection. 'I like the pictures because of their colours and its unusual pose. 'Most hummingbird pictures are with the bird sipping nectar and the wings backwards while the hummer hovers in an upright position. 'But the bird seemed to hug the flower. 'Even though the flower is disproportional to the bird, the picture looks balanced. I like the small details which my camera was able to capture.' He added that the birds were not shy and he managed to get four metres away from them whilst they battled over the flower. He said: 'The gardens are full of hummingbirds due to hummingbird feeders. When this happens there is competition between them. 'So even if it looks like a ballet in the air, they were most probably fighting for the food source. 'After their 'dance', the coppery-headed emerald took off and left the field.","Stunning photograph captures hummingbird hovering in the air with wings open in a pose that resembles a flower .

"Australia captain Michael Clarke has announced that Phillip Hughes' one-day international shirt number of 64 will be retired. Hughes' death on Thursday as a result of the injuries sustained during a Sheffield Shield game, when the South Australia batsman was struck on the head by a bouncer from New South Wales paceman Sean Abbott on Tuesday, has left a nation in mourning. In tribute to the left-hander, a grief-stricken Clarke said Cricket Australia has accepted a request to retire the ODI shirt number of Hughes, who made 25 appearances in the 50-over format to add to his 26 Test caps. Michael Clarke was brought to tears during a press conference on Saturday morning . Australia's cricket captain sent a message to the family of the late Phillip Hughes . Speaking on behalf of the Australian team and the support staff, Clarke said at a press conference: 'Words cannot express the loss we all feel as a team right now. To Greg, Virginia (his parents), Jason and Megan (his siblings) we share the deep pain that you're feeling. 'Last night, I asked Cricket Australia if Hughesy's Australian one-day international shirt number, 64, could be retired, to which they agreed. That means so much. 'His legacy of trying to improve each and every day will drive us for the rest of our lives. 'Our dressing room will never be the same, we loved him and always will.' It was the first time Clarke had spoken publicly since reading out a statement just hours after his close friend's death had been announced. And in an emotional address at the Sydney Cricket Ground, the 33-year-old paid tribute to Hughes' spirit and vowed to honour his memory. 'Apart from when he was home on the farm with his beloved cattle, Hughesy was at his happiest playing cricket for his country with his mates,' he said. Clarke said he asked for Hughes's One Day International shirt number to be retired, Cricket Australia agreed . Clarke was clearly distraught as he was led away after addressing the press .

Clarke made no mention of whether Australia would take to the field against India in the first Test at Brisbane, which is due to get under way next Thursday but is now in doubt of going ahead following this week's events. But Ricky Ponting, whom Clarke succeeded as national team captain, believes it would be unfair on the players to proceed with the game. 'It's been such a tragic week for the Hughes family and the cricket community, and I can't imagine how anybody can be expected to play Test cricket on Thursday,' he wrote in a column for News Limited newspapers on Saturday. 'In fact I don't think it would be right. 'Even if the boys think they can play, it would be a miracle if they find the right frame of mind needed for five days of cricket.'

"Germany will travel to this month's World Cup in Brazil with only one out-and-out striker after coach Joachim Low cut Kevin Volland from his final 23-man squad on Monday. Hoffenheim forward Volland joined defender Shkodran Mustafi and left back Marcel Schmelzer, still nursing a knee injury, as the three players left out of the final squad after being included in a provisional selection for a training camp in Italy. Volland's exclusion came as a surprise given the stocky striker's physical strength and all-round play were seen as a good alternative to veteran 35-year-old forward Miroslav Klose. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Veteran striker Miroslav Klose scoring for Bayern Munich . Broad shoulders! Miroslav Klose is the only out-and-out striker being taken by Germany to the World Cup . Brave: Head coach Joachim Low is likely to play Thomas Muller in a more advanced role . 'Obviously Shkodran, Marcel and Kevin are very disappointed and I an understand that because they had every right to hope they would be in Brazil,' Low said. 'All three are players who still have the chance to take part in several big tournaments in their careers.' Attacking midfielder Mario Gotze played as a striker in the 2-2 warmup draw against Cameroon on Sunday. Low, however, included Borussia Dortmund's Erik Durm, who can play as left back, in the final squad after he won his first cap on Sunday as well as first-choice keeper Manuel Neuer and captain Philipp Lahm, who are racing to get fit following injuries. Little-known Mustafi, a surprise call-up in the provisional squad, made way for a more experienced backline, arguably Germany's weakest point while Schmelzer paid the price for missing too much training due to his injury.

"Two more suspects in the Bali murder of Australian businessman Robert Ellis have been arrested after a violent confrontation with police. Both men were arrested on Sumba island, in Bali's east and were shot in the leg by officers, Bali police spokesman Hery Wiyanto said.

"The Catholic Church has taken a 'step in the right direction' by holding talks on how to provide better spiritual care to homosexual members, gay rights activists said today. Following Pope Francis' famous 'Who am I to judge?' comment on homosexuality last year, bishops have repeatedly spoken of the need to change the church's language towards gays from words of moral condemnation and judgment, to words of welcome and respect. Now for the first time a Vatican meeting is discussing gay and lesbian issues within the Church - a move described as 'a crack in the ice that we have been waiting for, for a very long time' by the Catholic gay rights group New Ways Ministry. Scroll down for video . Discussions: Pope Francis talks to prelates as he arrives for a morning session of a two-week synod on family issues, at the Vatican this morning. Among the issues the synod will debate will be how to provide better spiritual care to homosexual members . New era: The decision to include gay and lesbian issues at a meeting discussing Catholic family values bears all the hallmarks of the progressive attitude the Church has adopted under Pope Francis (pictured today) Despite their apparent softening on the issue, the Vatican's top canon lawyer was keen to make clear that the ongoing discussions will not focus on changing the Church's doctrine on homosexuality, nor will it lead to an endorsement of gay marriage or even gay unions. But the decision to include gay and lesbian issues at a meeting discussing Catholic family values bears all the hallmarks of the progressive attitude the Church has adopted under Pope Francis. On the other hand the last pope, Benedict XVI, penned some of the modern Catholic Church's key documents opposing homosexuality when he was head the Vatican's orthodoxy office in the 1980s. 'I think what we're seeing is a crack in the ice that we have been waiting for, for a very long time,' said Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry. 'It's a sign of a first step.' Church teaching holds that gay acts are 'intrinsically disordered,' sinful and a 'serious depravity,' and that homosexual inclination is 'objectively disordered.' At the same time, it says homosexuals themselves must be treated with respect and compassion and not suffer discrimination. 'I know scores of people who have left the Catholic Church because of those words,' DeBernardo said. Progressive: The Vatican synod is discussing gay and lesbian issues within the Church for the first time. The move has been described as 'a crack in the ice' by the Catholic gay rights group New Ways Ministry . Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI penned some of the Vatican's key documents on gays when he headed the Vatican's orthodoxy office; a 1986 letter of his to bishops on providing pastoral care to gays insisted that any church program must clearly state 'that homosexual activity is immoral.' His 2003 document opposing same-sex unions made clear that 'there are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to God's plan for marriage and family.' The Vatican's top canon lawyer, Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio, yesterday said that the Catholic Church would 'never' accept gay marriage or even bless a gay union. Despite that unbending position, there's no doubting that a shift in tone has occurred. Michael Brinkschroeder, co-president of the European Forum of LGBT Christian Groups, said  it was clear that the synod won't change doctrine, but that the 'Francis effect' appeared to be trickling down to local bishops. Many had 'lost their fear' and are freer now to engage in dialogue with gays in a way they couldn't under the last two popes, he said. 'With Benedict vanished from the scene, Francis has given signals for bishops to start pastoral work and dialogue,' he said. Welcome: Vatican Swiss Guards  salute Pope Francis as he arrives for the synod earlier in the week . Pope Francis famously said 'Who am I to judge?' when asked in 2013 about rumors that a top priestly adviser had a gay lover. DeBernardo, of New Ways Ministry, said the next step is for gays to be at the table offering their testimony to bishops. No openly gay Catholics have addressed the closed-door synod, but two Catholic heterosexual couples have spoken about experiences of devout Catholics welcoming gays or trying to provide pastoral care for them. He said he was 'euphoric' that some bishops had said language such as 'intrinsically disordered' was wholly ineffective in bringing people closer to the church. Not so fast, say conservative Catholics. Hard-line Cardinal Raymond Burke, who heads the Vatican's high court, insisted that gay sex was and will remain 'intrinsically disordered' and children must be protected from thinking otherwise. He was responding to testimony from an Australian Catholic couple who told the synod about friends who welcomed their gay son and his partner to a Christmas party. 'That particular form of relationship should not be imposed upon family members, and especially upon impressionable children,' Burke told the conservative LifeSiteNews. 'And I urge parents or grandparents - whoever it may be - to be very, very prudent in this matter and not to scandalize their children or grandchildren.'","Catholic Church includes gay and lesbian issues at synod for the first time .

"June 14: Costa Rica, 8pm, Estadio Castelao . June 19: England, 8pm, Arena de Sao Paulo . June 24: Italy, 5pm, Arena das Dunas . Follow all the action on MailOnline . Luis Suarez has had keyhole surgery on his knee and is expected to recover in time for the World Cup, says his mother. Sandra Diaz said the surgery was successful and that he is expected to recover in two-three weeks, which means he would be able to line up against England. 'The surgery is over and thank God everything went well. What Luis had wasn't as serious as we thought,' she said on her son's injury. Uruguay, who allege Suarez picked up the injury during Liverpool's final game of the Premier League season, remain confident he will be involved on June 19. Sportsmail understands that the country's football officials believe the 27-year-old is unlikely to be fit for the World Cup opener against Costa Rica, but that he could play five days later. Out? Luis Suarez is touch and go for the World Cup after it was revealed he needs surgery on a knee injury . Race against time: Suarez is unlikely to be fit for Uruguay's first World Cup match against Costa Rica . But Uruguay FA president Wilmar Valdez suggested if Suarez's recovery went to plan he could return to training in just over a fortnight. 'We know the surgery was a success and that the injury is not serious. We have to wait and see how he recovers,' he told Uruguayan newspaper La Ovacion. ""We had very little time to react and without knowing the extent of the injury, we didn't want to raise the alarm to the public. 'These are injuries that, considering Suarez's fitness and if the recovery is good, will not take long for him to return to play. 'We have to calculate if he will arrive for the first, second of third (group game at the World Cup). 'We know that normally the recovery period, if all goes well, is around 15 days to return to training.'We all know what Luis represents to the national team and more so, considering the great form he was in. 'Considering how valuable he is to the national team, it is a big concern for us.' Suarez, who was named the Professional Footballers' Association and Football Writers' Association player of the year after scoring 31 league goals, is his country's all-time leading scorer with 39 in 77 appearances. He picked up the injury in training and, following the meniscus surgery, the worst case scenario for this type of injury is 16 weeks on the sidelines. Suarez's sister Giovanna said her brother began feeling an uncomfortable pain during his last Premier League game and it returned during his first day of training with the Uruguayan national team on Wednesday. It's your time again: Diego Forlan is set to become even more involved in the Uruguay frontline this summer . Knock: The Liverpool striker picked up the injury on Wednesday and was immediately sent for an MRI scan . Upset: The 27-year-old is having meniscus surgery on Thursday and could miss up to six weeks . Main man: Paris Saint-Germain's Edinson Cavani will have the task of firing the South Americans to glory . Luis Suarez: (77 caps, 38 goals) Edinson Cavani: (60 caps, 20 goals) Diego Forlan: (107 caps, 36 goals) Christian Stuani: (66 caps, 13 goals) Abel Hernandez: (11 caps, 7 goals) However, she believes the Liverpool star will be ready for the World Cup. 'The problem is that these days he won't be able to play, and will only be able to do physiotherapy,' she said. 'He underwent a magnetic resonance and it came out that he had to undergo surgery. It was that quick.' On the injury, an Uruguay FA official said: ‘It was all unexpected. The latest information is that we . are deciding what to do, but there are increased possibilities . (involving surgery). 'I can’t tell you anything more. The AUF (Uruguay . Federation) will announce it officially on Thursday morning.’ Suarez was . checked over by medical staff on Wednesday after picking up the knock . in training just three weeks before the tournament starts in Brazil. With the final 23-man World Cup squad needed to be ratified on June 2, it leaves Uruguay with very little wriggle room. Any decision to include Suarez - not match fit - would still represent a sizeable risk. They . won't be encouraged to know that Fernando Torres underwent meniscus . surgery prior to the 2010 World Cup in April and didn't play his first . game for seven weeks. Should . Suarez be out for longer, it would heavily impact on Liverpool's start . to the next campaign. The Reds are aware of the injury but haven't been . officially informed. The 27-year-old arrived in Montevideo for training on Tuesday morning, feeling discomfort in a session with Oscar . Tabarez's squad on Wednesday but continuing before encountering the major problem . later in the evening. Roberto . Pastoriza, executive of the Uruguayan Football Association, confirmed . that they had attempted to keep the news under wraps. Golden boot: Suarez was the Premier League top scorer and won the PFA Player of the Year award . Developments . heap more pressure on Paris Saint-Germain's Edinson Cavani, who will . lead the line when they face Costa Rica on June 14. Veteran . Diego Forlan - so impressive in South Africa four years ago - was . expected to play a bit-part role but may now be needed alongside Cavani. They do still have other options, with Espanyol's Christian Stuani and Palermo's Abel Hernandez waiting in the wings. Since . Suarez signed for Liverpool in January 2011, he has not missed a single . match because of fitness issues and has been regularly hailed by his . team-mates and manager for his extraordinary durability and . determination – he will always make himself available for training, even . if he is carrying the type of slight tweak that would convince others . to spend time in the medical room. Should . Suarez be prevented from leading the 2010 semi-finalists in Brazil, he . would be left distraught. The last time there was a major tournament in . South America, the 27-year-old was the star of the show as Uruguay won . the Copa America in 2011. 1987: Born January 24 in Salto, Uruguay. 2005: Makes professional debut with Montevideo club Nacional, scoring 12 goals in 29 games in his one and only season in South America. 2006: Signs for Dutch side FC Groningen and fires 10 goals in 29 appearances for the club. 2007: February 8 - Makes debut for Uruguay against Colombia and is sent off in the 85th minute.August - Joins Ajax in a deal reportedly worth 7.5million euros. 2010: May - Enjoys his most prolific season in Holland, with 35 goals in 33 Eredivisie matches.June - Scores three goals to help Uruguay reach the World Cup quarter-finals but is then sent off for a goal-line handball against Ghana in the last eight.

Hodgson's squad will be keen to impress the manager and a nation against a nation ranked 42 in the world at Wembley on Friday. Sportsmail's James Andrew will bring you everything Hodgson and Gerrard have to say from 4pm. Host commentator . 'We didn’t do tactical sessions in Portugal. That was setting the tone and physical preparation. This week we’ve started tactical preparations. I would prefer to judge potential on what I’ve seen over the last two years.' 'He’s improved his all-round game. His passing in final third has improved and he’s added quality goals. It wouldn’t surprise me if he had a big impact on the World Cup.' 'I’m very proud of my roots. I’m one of the Baby Boom generation after the war and benefited from parents who made enormous sacrifices.' 'It’s always nice to meet people at that level. It was nice he took time and trouble today. He has a busy schedule. He wished all the players success and told us the whole country is behind us.' Rooney: 'I’m very pleased with Wayne Rooney He came to us fully fit after working during his week’s holiday in Portugal. He obviously worked very hard because from the first moment he has been fit and lively as you'd expect. The past is the past. The present and future really interests me and I’m very happy.' 'This is the biggest moment of my career. I feel more at home with the players now than two years ago at the Euros.' 'Good players can play together. The only way we'll be successful is as a team and working together' 'I'm proud to be captain. I’m desperate to do well form personal point view and looking forward to team doing well. In Brazil makes it extra special. Everyone is excited.' 'I don’t know if he’s available. Only people who know is Luis and the doctors. It’s not my focus. My focus is on the England players.' 'Maybe it feels slightly different. There’s a lot of positivity about. The squad’s focused, desperate to do well and we can’t wait for June 12 to come around.' 'Everyone is pushing with three opportunities to stake your claim. Everyone’s impressed, even the young lads who have been invited to train with us.' 'I was never worried about that. I know he’s played tribute to Arsene Wenger and I would like to pay my tribute. Arsene is a well-balanced and intelligent coach and realises this tournament represents a great opportunity for Jack, something he really wants to do. Arsene has nursed him through so when he joined us he was in peak form.' 'They have all impressed me. If I could bottle what I am seeing in training and let it out on June 14, then I would.' 'When you have first class players like Rooney and Sturridge I believe they can always play together.' 'I have not told the players the team I have selected yet. I will do it in a meeting at lunch time tomorrow.' 'I’m not that near to knowing the team. 'There are a number of senior players who will feature, but there are a number of positions up for grabs.' Roy Hodgson says there are no fresh injury concerns. Luke Shaw has a cold and the England boss is unsure if he will be ready to face Peru . England's U19s have missed out on a place at the European Championships. The Young Lions needed just a draw to qualify, but a 95th minute own goal from England's Lewis Baker means that they lost to Ukraine 1-0 and miss out on qualification. Jack Wilshere had some injury problems towards the end of the season, but he is in the squad and he has thanked Arsene Wenger for keeping his World Cup dream alive. We are expecting Roy Hodgson to speak ahead the Peru game any minute now.

It was the first time that David Cameron had visited England's new training camp in Burton and he spoke to manager Hodgson as well as players Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard. England play Peru on Friday night. The majority of the squad will be back at Wembley 24 hours later for Carl Froch's mega-fight with George Groves. England then head off to their pre-World Cup training camp in Miami. England then play Ecuador and Honduras in Miami before heading to Brazil. They open their World Cup campaign on June 14 against Italy in Manaus. Peru were hand picked opponents by England.

"It comes as a surprise to hear Rob Green’s goalkeeping howler for England against the United States in the last World Cup was not the worst moment of his career. Nor was the aftermath of blame, or being relegated from the Premier League with West Ham the following May. Far worse was the powerlessness of not playing for Queens Park Rangers last season, watching helplessly from the substitutes’ bench as the club ‘imploded’ and sank into the Championship saddled by £177million of debt. Of all his travails over the past four years, it was this experience that hurt Green the most. The 34-year-old has the chance to help make amends next Saturday, when QPR meet Derby County in the Championship play-off final at Wembley, and seems energised by the chance to make a difference. In the meantime, he is determined not to ‘waste energy’ on a dream he believes is out of his control. Dejection: QPR goalkeeper Rob Green says the powerlessness of not playing last season was worse than his World Cup blunder against the USA in South Africa . Gaffe: Green allowed a routine shot to fall out of his grasp with England drawing the game 1-1 . The Championship play-off final is the most lucrative fixture in the whole of global sport because the winner gets access to Premier League riches. This year’s play-off is worth at least £134million — and that is a worse-case scenario. It is £62m of Premier League prize money even if finishing bottom next season, plus four years of subsequent ‘parachute’ payments totalling a further £72m at least. However, if QPR win, they face the horror prospect of being hit with a fine of perhaps £60m or more because of financial fair play rules. The goalkeeper has started just one match for England since allowing Clint Dempsey’s shot to slip through his hands in Rustenburg in June 2010. His name was not even mentioned as Roy Hodgson revealed his World Cup squad this week. Green, however, is not bitter. Nor does he look for sympathy. Instead, he says the intervening years have been the best of his life, bringing marriage and two children, even if the 2012-13 season brought another crushing low professionally. He said: ‘My wife went for lunch with neighbours and the neighbour said, “My husband’s really sorry for what happened at the World Cup”. ‘Why? Heavens, we’re still surviving. I’m still a professional footballer living an amazing life. It’s not like I’ve suffered. It’s been tough professionally and personally because your pride gets hit, but it’s a big picture. Jubilant: Green celebrates after QPR score the winning goal against Wigan in the semi-final . Disdain: Mark Hughes brought in Green and then promptly signed Julio Cesar to replace him as No 1 . ‘The England thing was beyond football but last year was the worst year in the best part of 20 years of professional football. I’ve been in teams that have struggled but I have not sat on the side and watched a team implode or disintegrate or combust into nothing thinking “I can help”. It’s a tough experience.’ Green can scarcely hide his disdain for former QPR boss Mark Hughes, who signed him on a free transfer from West Ham in the summer of 2012 and then dropped him when Brazil international Julio Cesar suddenly arrived on £80,000 a week. Green found out only when watching Sky Sports News. By late November QPR were bottom of the Premier League and Hughes had been sacked. But although new boss Harry Redknapp initially brought Green back into the team, the Englishman endured another four months on the sidelines before being recognised as Rangers’ No 1. Relegation came as little surprise to Green, who had seen the warning signs in pre-season when his new club splurged almost £7m on agents’ fees alone. He is frank enough to acknowledge QPR’s problems are not over yet, either. First choice: Harry Redknapp has reinstalled Green as his No 1 this season . Loan stars: Green's former replacement Julio Cesar is still Brazil's first choice in goal . Highly-paid . players such as Cesar, Loic Remy and Adel Taarabt have been sent on loan . to reduce a wage bill that is higher than that of Spanish champions and . Champions League finalists Atletico Madrid, but the £120m bounty of . promotion could be hit by the threat of a £62.1m fine for breaching the . Football League’s Financial Fair Play regulations. QPR had losses of . £65.4m last year, far in excess of the £8m allowed in the second tier. Green . said: ‘We sat in pre-season and there was me, Shaun Derry, Clint Hill, . Jamie Mackie, Heidar Helguson and we said, “There will be a week at one . point in the season and we’ll all be there and we’ll know we’re in . trouble”. The guys who come-and-go came and went. We played a game in . December and we were all playing and we realised we were bang in it . because something was going terribly wrong. ‘There . are people at the club who are still fighting fires and, come the . summer, will have a lot of headaches because of previous decisions. You . have a group of guys that have gone out on loan and are coming back and . won’t want to be at the club. Fees: Tony Fernandes and the club are facing fines of £60m for breaking Financial Fair Play . ‘I’m not . picking on people but you look at a guy like Adel who has gone to AC . Milan. If we get promoted does he want to come to a Premier League scrap . when he has cruised through a Serie A season? People like Loic.

"Joseph Corey, 67, admits shooting animal officer Roy Marcum, 45, but lawyers say he should not be found guilty of first-degree murder because his hoarding disorder means he could not have planned the killing . A TV psychologist has testified at the trial of a hoarder who shot and killed an animal control officer as he came to take the man's pets away. Joseph Corey, 67, fired on officer Roy Marcum, 45, as Mr Marcum came to take eight dogs and two cats away as Corey was being evicted. Prosecutors have been arguing for a first-degree murder conviction, but the defense says because of Corey's obsessive disorder he was unable to plan the killing - a necessary condition for a first-degree charge. Today the jury heard from Robin Zasio, from the  show 'Hoarders', who said Corey appeared to be suffering from the disorder. Looking at images of Corey's house, with garbage piled six feet high, small alleys cleared between the trash, and animals locked in small cages, Ms Zasio said it he bore all the hallmarks of a hoarder. Ms Zasio, who also founded the Sacramento-based Compulsive Hoarding Center, told the court the threat of somebody taking a hoarder's possessions away would be 'devastating'. According to the Sacramento Bee, she said: 'For somebody whose existence is based on caring for these animals and protecting their stuff I can’t think of any other word to say but devastating. 'It’s chemically driven. You will see very extreme anxiety and fear because of the chemicals going through their brain. 'They believe they’re doing these animals a favor. [The animals] are almost like their children in their own mind. That’s what their interaction is during the day, between them and their animals.' When asked whether such a threat could drive a hoarder to become suicidal or homicidal, she said 'absolutely'. Zasio estimated that there are around 4million hoarders living in America, but under cross-examination from the defence, admitted that she had never before seen a case of a hoarder killing someone who had come to take their possessions. Corey, a retired mechanic, shot and killed Mr Marcum on November 28, 2012, at his home in Galt, about 20 miles south of Sacramento, California. Robin Zasio, from TV show Hoarders, said Corey appeared to be suffering from a compulsive disorder, and suggested that threatening to take his possessions away could have made make him homicidal . Corey was in the process of being evicted after failing to make a payment on his house for more than three years, and a sheriff's deputy served him with an eviction notice. Corey was forced to move out of the house, and the locks were changed. While he was able to put his physical possessions into storage, his eight dogs and two cats were left behind. Corey was told they would be taken from him unless he found a suitable home for them. The following day Mr Marcum was sent to Corey's house to retrieve the animals, but unknown to him, Corey had suck back inside, blocked the door and was armed and waiting. As Mr Marcum approached the front door, Corey grabbed a high-powered a 35 Whelen bolt-action hunting rifle, crouched at the top of the stairs, and fired down through the porch glass. Corey shot Mr Marcum with a high-powered hunting rifle in November 2012 as Mr Marcum came to take his pets away, sparking an 17-hour standoff with police (pictured) Mr Marcum was hit in the left side, and later died in hospital. The shooting sparked a 17-hour standoff with police, after which Corey gave himself up. The trial also heard from Charlotte Marcum, Mr Marcum's mother, who said she visited Corey while he was in jail to challenge him over her son's killing. When she asked him why he had opened fire, she claims Corey responded: 'Because I wanted to kill an officer.' The defense has now rested, and the attorneys are scheduled to present their final arguments to the jury on Wednesday, after which the panel will begin its deliberations.","Joseph Corey, 67, shot and killed animal officer Roy Marcum, 45, in 2012 .

"A close friend and business associate of the murdered McStay family has been arrested after the victims were found buried in the desert. Charles 'Chase' Merritt, 57, has been arrested for the murders of businessman Joseph Chase, his wife Summer, and their children Gianni and Joseph Jr, aged three and four. He was taken into custody two days ago in Chatsworth, California, less than two hours' drive from the shallow graves where the beaten bodies were found. Merritt, long the prime suspect in the case, had previously told MailOnline exclusively that he was being wrongfully harassed over the case, even saying: 'All I want is for them to find the a******s who did this.' Scroll down for video . Arrested: Merritt, pictured center being led away after his arrest, was taken in on November 5 and will appear in court today . Prime suspect: Merritt has previously denied wrongdoing and said he hopes police find the 'a******s who did this' Victims: Summer McStay, left, her sons Joseph Jr McStay, four, (center left), Gianni McStay, three (center right) and Joseph McStay (right) were found in shallow graves in the southern California desert last year . The couple and their boys vanished in February 2010 from their Fallbrook home in San Diego County, and were thought missing until the bodies were found three years later. Corpses later identified as the McStays were dug up from a shallow grave. Investigations determined they had died of blunt force wounds, and now believe they were murdered at home. Authorities announced his arrest in a news conference today, ahead of his first appearance in court today. Merritt was due to be arraigned at Victorville Courthouse, California. But after a brief appearance the arraignment was pushed back to November 12. A statement from the San Bernardino County Sheriff said: 'Chase Merritt was arrested without incident and transported to the West Valley Detention Center. He was booked for murder and is being held without bail. The District Attorney’s Office filed four counts of murder against Merritt.' Family and suspect: Michael McStay, brother to murdered Joseph, left, spoke tearfully at the conference announcing the arrest of Charles 'Chase' Merritt, pictured right in a police mugshot . Announcement: San Bernardino Sheriff John McMahon speaks during a news conference today . Murder scene? Investigators now believe the McStay family was killed at their home, pictured, in Fallbrook, California . Shallow graves: Workers are pictured filling in the holes where the McStays were found buried in the Mojave Desert almost a year ago . If found guilty of the murders, he could face the death penalty. Merritt was taken into custody on November 5, and is now in the West Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga, California, where he is being held with no bail. Authorities refused to discuss motives for the killing. But in a recent interview with ABC10 News, Joseph McStay's father Patrick said it was 'all money'. He told the channel: 'We had information that took us straight to Merritt... It was all money... Joey had some big contracts he'd put together worth millions.' McStay and Merritt were in a similar line of business - according to CNN, Merrit would often sell custom-made water fountains to McStay's more general garden business. Investigators today said: 'Joseph McStay and Charles Merritt owned their own businesses, both related to waterfalls. 'They started working together and became friends.' Speaking at the conference, Mike Ramos, the district attorney for San Bernadino County, said: 'This is a cold and callous murder of an entire family.' He added that there is 'No reason, no motive for that ever to occur - especially for the young children, the most vulnerable victims.' Tearful members of the McStay family today remembered their loved ones and called for justice to be done over their killings. Family: Susan McStay, left, and Michael McStay, right, both spoke today demanding justice after Merritt's arrest. The two are pictured above at a press conference last year . Michael McStay, Joseph's brother, said: 'I just wanted to see it through to the end. 'Joseph was a great brother, a great father, he would've done anything to protect those boys and Summer and he tried to help Chase and provide work for this guy - and this is how he was repaid. 'I know he's in a better place - I know that sounds a little trite but this gives our family a little more closure, the opportunity to heal and move forward and he'll get what he's got coming to him.' Susan McStay, Michael's mother, added: 'My son and his family was a beautiful family that did not deserve this, Joey was so generous and kind to so many people - I always kept hope that we'd find him.' '...That phonecall [to say their bodies had been found] was the biggest shock of our lives. But I still had hope because I felt the strength and power from this team [of law enforcement officers]. They did a wonderful job. Defiant: Last year in an exclusive MailOnline interview, Merritt denied wrongdoing and hoped police would find the 'a******s who did this' 'Now I received that phonecall, and now there's a little more to our journey. I need justice from the law and the courts.' A year ago, their skeletons were found in the desert outside Victorville. The site was not far off heavily traveled Interstate 15, which connects San Diego and Las Vegas. Investigators said there were no signs of forced entry at the family's home or in their SUV, which was found parked near the U.S.-Mexico border. Neither Joseph nor Summer had told family or friends they were leaving. When they were reported missing, authorities went to the house and found eggs that had rotted on the kitchen counter and two pet dogs in the backyard, indicating the family hadn't prepared for an extended leave. Nothing was missing from the home, and the couple's credit cards and tens of thousands of dollars in bank accounts never were touched. Last November, Charles Merritt was eulogizing the McStay family, he spoke with his 'best friend' Joseph McStay multiple times a day and had an exciting business venture in the pipeline. Now, almost a year later, he has been charged with murdering McStay, his wife and his two children, aged three and four years old. Merritt, who said he took a lie detector test to remove himself from suspicion, spoke at length about the murdered family in an exclusive interview with MailOnline last year. Speaking from a restaurant in the Mojave Desert, he called for the law to catch whoever is responsible, and claimed he himself was 'the least violent man on the planet.' In words which take on a chilling meaning after he was today charged with four counts of murder, he said: 'I was the last person Joseph saw.' He then went on to describe a business meeting, and the last call from McStay's phone number - to him. Merritt said: 'He came to Rancho Cucamonga on February 4 to talk to me about a huge business deal we had going on in Saudi Arabia. ‘We met for an hour-and-a-half for lunch. He was so excited. We had the Saudi Arabian project and a few other things going on. 'The business had never been so good and we were looking forward to the future. He did nothing to suggest there was anything wrong or untoward. ‘We both left and went home and I spoke to him on the phone about two or three times on his drive back to Fallbrook, all standard business stuff. The last time I spoke to him was around 6 o’clock. ‘It has been reported that I spoke to him in the evening, but that isn’t true. He did call me at 8.28pm, but I was watching a movie with my girlfriend, looked at the phone and decided not to answer. 'When you talk to Joseph it takes about half an hour, so I thought I’d catch up with him in the morning. ‘I didn’t answer that call and I regret it to this day.’ Merritt also responded to widespread accusations he was behind the killings - fueled in part by the revelation he had a criminal record and had served two jail sentences. He eventually agreed to a lie detector test in a bid to shake off suspicion. Speaking of the crimes, he said: 'I regret it, but that doesn't give people the right to trash me, especially after I have lost my best friend. ‘Very soon after the disappearance, Lt Brugos who was leading the case, called me and asked if I would take a lie detector test, because he was convinced I knew where Joseph was. ‘I declined at first and got some advice from an attorney, who told me not to do it, because if anything at all shows up they will harass you. ‘But I spoke to my girlfriend about it extensively and decided, you know what, I’m just going to do the damn test, so they can forget about me and focus on something that might actually help find him. ‘About three of them came out to my attorney’s office in Palm Valley. They asked me whether I knew anything about the disappearance, and if I did know anything, would I tell them. ‘After I’d finished, Brugos’s partner said to me, ""well there are a couple of inconsistencies"" but that was just them trying to trick me into saying something. I didn’t hear any more about it after that. ‘Was I a suspect? Well, I don’t know if I’m the only one they asked to do a lie detector test, but I am the only one who actually agreed. They were certainly on my case.' He said: ‘I may not be the nicest person in the world, but I have only ever had Joseph’s best interests at heart. That’s all I have ever cared about, despite what had been written about me. ‘I am a normal man, trying to take care of my three kids and I have lost a very good friend. 'I wasn’t Joseph’s best friend, but he was mine. I didn’t have many people close to me, but we shared a lot.'","Charles Merritt, 57, has been arrested over murder of four family members .

"Suzanne Porter, 25, was arrested after she urinated in the street and 'exposed backside' to officers . A young mother who punched a policewoman’s teeth in after she was arrested for urinating in the street gloated about it on Facebook and posted pictures of her blood stained dress. Suzanne Porter, 25, from Clitheroe in Lancashire, had been drinking shots on a night out with nine friends when police were called to move the rowdy group along. Officers were driving along when Porter, a barmaid, went out in the middle of the road and bent over before lifting up her dress and ‘exposed her backside’. Burnley Crown Court heard that PC Kirstie Pitcher then pulled the van over and got out but Porter ran off. The officer was able to catch up on foot and challenged her about urinating in the street, after the group were kept under CCTV observations, and exposing herself to police. Prosecutor Joseph Allman told the court that when challenged Porter replied ‘Oh, did I?’ before PC Pitcher was joined by colleagues who decided to make an arrest. PC Pitcher initially attempted to detain Porter before assisting in arresting her Porter’s brother, Gary Place, 29, who was also drunk and threatening officers with his sister’s stiletto shoes. When the officer went back to arrest Porter she was punched in the face, knocking off her glasses and causing her to stagger and fall over the other detainee. Mr Allman said: ‘It was without provocation and knocking her teeth back in her mouth so that she could feel they were dislodged.’ She was said to have felt immediate pain to her face and when she realised her teeth were loose in her mouth, she spat one out into her hand and shouted down her radio to her colleagues to arrest Porter. Porter ran off but was arrested and was found to have the victim’s blood on her white dress. When questioned, she said she had been drinking shots after work before the incident in May. She apologised to police but Mr Allman added: ‘She was later gloating about the incident. She posted a picture of her blood-stained dress with the comment: ”Ruined”. PC Kirstie Pitcher had been attempting to detain Porter when she thumped her in the mouth in May this year . ‘One of her Facebook associates says: “All she will want for Christmas is her two front teeth.” The defendant replied: “Ha, ha.” ‘The posting, along with another, a picture of a broken tooth, again accompanied by “ha, ha,“ added to the victim’s distress and disgust over her ordeal.’ PC Pitcher had a broken front tooth and three others were loose and also suffered distortion of the cartilage in her nose. The prosecutor said: ‘She was off work four weeks and when she did go back, she was accompanied by a colleague because of the impact this has had on her confidence. ‘She had emergency dental treatment costing £1,300 and was on soft food for two weeks. In a number of ways, it has profoundly affected her confidence. ‘Her front teeth are discoloured and that plainly is a matter of great upset to her.’ Porter, a barmaid, posted a picture on Facebook of her blood-stained dress after the attack and wrote 'ruined' A friend replied to Porter's Facebook post with 'All she will want for Christmas is her two front teeth', while Porter wrote back 'Ha ha' and posted a picture of a broken tooth . Porter, who had a previous conviction for violence and intimidation, admitted assault causing actual bodily harm and was sentenced to ten months in prison. In mitigation her counsel James Heyworth, said there were ‘positives and negatives’ to her character. The previous conviction for violence went back to when she was a teenager in 2005. The barrister continued: ‘The Facebook messages do her no credit whatsoever. She has been banned from all pubs in Clitheroe, which will help mitigate against this type of behaviour happening again. 'She knows she’s done something very, very wrong.’ Judge Miss Recorder Tina Landale, passing the sentence, told Porter: ‘The victim was particularly vulnerable in the circumstances. You targeted her.’ Porter was sentenced to 10 months in prison and it was revealed she has a previous conviction for violence . Judge Landale said PC Pitcher ‘took particular pride’ in her teeth and had been caused anxiety, distress and pain. She continued: ‘A serious aggravating feature is the public boasting and celebration. It added to the impact upon her.’ Porter’s brother Gary Place, of Chatburn, Lancashire, pleaded guilty to using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour and was fined £75, with £85 costs and a £20 victim surcharge at an earlier hearing.","Suzanne Porter, 25, had been drinking shots on night out with nine friends .

"The number of dollar billionaires in the world has more than doubled to 1,645 since the financial crisis of 2008, according to a new report which warned that inequality between rich and poor is spiralling out of control. Despite the austerity affecting ordinary people around the globe in the wake of the recession, the richest 85 billionaires saw their fortunes increase by a total of around £150 billion over the past year - the equivalent of £415 million a day or almost a third of a million pounds a minute, the report by development charity Oxfam found. Oxfam's chief executive Mark Goldring, pictured centre, said hundreds of millions  are living without access to clean drinking water and without enough food to feed their families while elite can never spend all their money . Research earlier this year found that these 85 people had access to wealth equal to that of half the world's population. If the world's billionaires were taxed at a rate of just 1.5% on their wealth over 1 billion US dollars, it would raise £46 billion a year - enough to get every child into school and deliver health services in all of the world's poorest countries - said the report, entitled Even it Up: Time To End Extreme Inequality. Oxfam's chief executive Mark Goldring said: 'Inequality is one of the defining problems of our age. In a world where hundreds of millions of people are living without access to clean drinking water and without enough food to feed their families, a small elite have more money than they could spend in several lifetimes. 'The consequences of extreme inequality are harmful to everyone. It robs millions of people of better life chances and fuels crime, corruption and even violent conflict. Put simply, it is holding back efforts to end poverty. 'Governments around the world have been guilty of a naive faith that wealth going to those at the top will automatically benefit everyone. That's not true - it is their responsibility to ensure the poorest are not left behind.' Oxfam challenged governments to follow a seven-point plan to rein in inequality, by clamping down on tax dodging; investing in universal free healthcare and education; introducing equal pay legislation; agreeing a global goal to tackle inequality; introducing minimum wages and moving towards a living wage for all workers; shifting the burden of taxation from labour and consumption towards capital and wealth; and providing adequate safety nets for the poor, including a minimum income guarantee. Bank of England chief economist Andrew Haldane said Oxfam report  speaks to the wider collective interest. The report found that there are 16 billionaires in Sub-Saharan Africa living alongside 358 million people in extreme poverty, while in South Africa inequality is now greater than it was at the end of apartheid. If African levels of growth and inequality continue on current trends, it is estimated that the continent's poverty rate won't fall below 3% until 2075. Mr Goldring said: 'Extreme inequality is far from being inevitable - it is the result of political choices and economic fashion, kept in place by a wealthy elite whose influence helps keep the rules rigged in their favour. Too often, the 'invisible hand of the market' is used as an excuse to pick the pockets of the poor. 'In countries around the world, a wealthy minority are taking an ever-increasing share of the pie. This is not just an issue of fairness, but in a world where people are dying of hunger or because they can't afford healthcare, it becomes an issue of life and death.' Responding to the report, Bank of England chief economist Andrew Haldane said: 'In highlighting the problem of inequality, Oxfam not only speaks to the interests of the poorest people but also the wider collective interest. 'There is rising evidence that extreme inequality harms, durably and significantly, the stability of the financial system and growth in the economy. It slows development of the human, social and physical capital necessary for raising living standards and improving well-being. That penny is starting to drop among policymakers and politicians.' Nelson Mandela's widow Graca Machel said: 'The last decades have seen incredible human progress across Africa and the world. But this progress is under threat from the scourge of rapidly rising inequality. 'Addressing the gap between the richest people and the poorest and the impact this gap has on other pervasive inequalities between men and women and between races that make life for those at the bottom unbearable is an imperative of our times. Too many children born today have their future held hostage by the low income of their parents, their gender and their race. 'The good news is that this growing inequality is not inevitable. It can be resolved.'","Despite recession the richest 85 saw their fortunes up by around £150 billion .

"Many people who lined up for days to be among the first in the world to buy the new iPhone 6 say they plan to sell them in China for triple the price they paid. The latest version of Apple's popular handset went on sale in Australia and some other countries on Friday, triggering buyer mania as fans queued around the block. But the staggered release of the iPhone 6 means it is not available in some countries - including the world's largest mobile market, China, where Apple is yet to announce a release date. The basic model iPhone 6 16GB sells for $869 in Australia. It has already appeared on Chinese e-commerce such as sea.taobao.com, where it is selling for 12,000 renminbi, or around $2,175,00. Customers outside Apple's flagship store in Sydney told Daily Mail Australia on Friday Chinese buyers are paying up to three times the retail price for the top of the line model iPhone 6 Plus 128GB - just 50 were released at the George Street Apple store. Scroll down for video . The queue at the George Street store in Sydney went on for four blocks, some people camped for days . The first lot of buyers outside the George Street store bought the 50 iPhone 6 Plus models . Website airtasker.com had people sign up to the website to recruit people who could stand in the iPhone queue and get paid up to $300. Jon Farrell, 21, web designer for the site, said: 'Lots of people are selling them abroad.I would say up to 40 per cent are being sold overseas.' Jon Farrell and airtasker.com CEO Tim Fung said some people were getting paid $300 just to queue . Jason Lee, a 22-year-old accounting student at the University of Technology Sydney, said he had queued outside the Apple store for 20 hours to buy the iPhone 6. 'I am buying two of them and selling them onto a friend who will sell them to people in China,' he said. 'I am making $150 per phone and when they are sold on in China they will probably make a lot more. Jason Lee said he bought two iPhone 6s - one for him and one to on-sell in through a friend in China . 'There is so many people in China that want the phone. It is really common for people to be buying the phones to then sell them on. 'Everyone would have been here to get the iPhone 6 Plus but the first 50 have been sold which is disappointing.' As many as five million iPhones may be smuggled into China before the new models are officially available, said Neil Shah, Mumbai-based research director for devices at Counterpoint Research, bloomberg.com reported. The gold version of the iPhones are going for as much as $4,000 on the Chinese black market. Mr Lee and three friends, Jacob Jing, Matthew Tsui, Charlie Zhang, spent more than 20 hours waiting for the phones . Buyers dressed up warmly to protect themselves from the cold after waiting outside all night in Sydney . Jacob Jing, 24, another University of Technology Sydney student, told Daily Mail Australia: 'I have seen so many familiar faces in the queue, loads of students from university.

"Italy forward Giuseppe Rossi was baffled on Monday after being left out of the World Cup squad, the third time in a row he has missed out on a major tournament. Rossi, who has just recovered from his latest knee injury, took part in a week's training and played Saturday's friendly against Ireland, only to be left out when coach Cesare Prandelli trimmed his provisional 30-man squad to the final 23 on Sunday. Rossi poured scorn on suggestions that he was still not fully fit. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Italy training ahead of the World Cup . Axed: Giuseppe Rossi has missed out on Italy coach Cesare Prandelli's final 23-man squad for the World Cup . 'Everyone is saying I'm out of shape: ask anyone the results of the tests from last week and from the match,' said the American-born forward on Twitter on Monday. 'You will be surprised. Challenges? Fear? What a laugh,' added Rossi, who is probably Italy's most reliable forward when fully fit. 'The most important thing now is to support Italy.' Prandelli did not give any interviews on Sunday when the squad was announced but had said before the decision that Rossi would be judged on his fitness and his performance against Ireland.Initial reaction was mixed. Fans of Rossi's club Fiorentina, a team Prandelli used to coach, were furious, but some commentators said the coach had been consistent with his previous declarations that he would not take any players who were not fully match fit. Rossi made his Italy debut against Bulgaria in 2008 and played in the Confederations Cup the following year, scoring twice in a 3-1 win over United States. That brought vitriolic criticism from American fans, angry that Rossi, who was born in the U.S. and lived there until he was 12, had chosen to play for the country of his parents instead. Final call: Manager Cesare Prandelli said he would judge Rossi on his fitness after the friendly against Ireland . Past mistakes: Marcello Lippi said last week he regretted leaving Rossi out of his 2010 World Cup side . Rossi's unlucky run began when he just missed out on being selected for the 2010 World Cup by coach Marcello Lippi. The following year, he suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury while playing for Villarreal in a Spanish league match. He fought desperately to be fit for Euro 2012, only to re-injure the knee in training the following April, causing him to miss the tournament. He made an excellent comeback with Fiorentina this season, scoring 14 goals by early January to make him Serie A's leading scorer. However, he then suffered a less serious injury, a second degree sprain to the medial collateral ligament, in the same knee which sidelined him until the start of this month. Prandelli was among those who were moved by Rossi's efforts to get fit in time. 'The chance to play at the World Cup is what makes me get up in the morning,' said Rossi.","Fiorentina striker poured scorn on suggestions he isn't fit .

"The first two seasons of British period drama 'Downton Abbey' have taken U.S. audiences by storm, and plans are now in place for America to receive a period drama of its own. And now, just six weeks out from series three, NBC has signed its Oscar-winning creator, Julian Fellowes, to come up with a show based on America's past. Set in late 19th century New York City, 'The Gilded Age' will follow the lives of 'the princes of the American Renaissance, and the vast fortunes they made - and spent.' New show: Julian Fellowes, pictured at The Mount, in Lenox, Massachusetts, the estate of Edith Wharton, who will likely star in his drama for NBC on the Gilded Age in New York . The new television drama will be produced by the NBC Universal television studio and could be on the air as early as Fall 2013. 'This was a vivid time with dizzying, brilliant ascents and calamitous falls, of record-breaking ostentation and savage rivalry,' Mr Fellowes said in a statement. '(It was) a time when money was king.' The Gilded Age in New York was marked by the rise of industry, invention and transportation. Pioneers: J.P. Morgan, left, and John D. Rockefeller, right, were two prominent figures of the Gilded Age in New York . Moneymakers: Andrew Carnegie, left, and Cornelius Vanderbilt, right, were among America's first millionaires . The era was personified in bankers J.P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller and Cornelius Vanderbilt. They were the business pioneers who became America's first millionaires after founding steel, oil and finance. As lavish mansions sprung up along . Fifth Avenue, the Gilded Age was also the time when the Astor family . rose to prominence, eventually becoming 'the landlords of New York.' The famed Waldorf-Astoria hotel, . Manhattan’s Astor Place and the Astoria neighborhood of Queens are just a . few of the locations that continue to carry the Astor name. Lavish: Mansions, like the one belonging to Cornelius Vanderbilt, sprung up along Fifth Avenue at the height of the Gilded Age . Success: The commercial and critical success of 'Downton Abbey,' pictured, has been huge since it first graced U.S. screens two years ago . Soap: A glorified soap, 'Downton Abbey' follows the aristocratic Crawley family; their romances, tragedies and endless struggles of the manor's many servants . NBC reportedly passed up 'Downton Abbey' at the start, believing the costume . drama wouldn't appeal to American viewers. The glorified soap opera follows the aristocratic Crawley family; their romances, tragedies and endless struggles of the manor's many servants. The commercial and critical success of 'Downton Abbey' has been huge since it graced U.S. screens two years ago. Winner: Mr Fellowes , pictured at the Emmys, has won scores of awards for his show 'Downton Abbey' It has won six Emmy awards, including two for Fellowes and two for Dame Maggie Smith, who plays Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham. According to the New York Post, the show's second season was the most watched series ever with its February 5, 2012 episode rated No. 2 at 9pm behind the Super Bowl. The program has been sent up on 'Saturday Night Live' and by late night host Jimmy Fallon as well as inspiring scores of YouTube videos. Mr Fellowes will continue working on 'Downton Abbey,' which has been renewed for a fourth season. In United States history, the Gilded Age was the period following the Civil War, running from 1877 to 1893 when the next era began, the Progressive Era. The term was coined by writers Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner in The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today, satirizing what they believed to be an era of serious social problems hidden by a thin layer of gold. The Gilded Age was a time of enormous growth as the United States jumped to the lead in industrialisation ahead of Britain. The economic boom attracted millions from Europe. Railroads were the major industry, but the factory system, coal mining, and labor unions also gained in importance. During the 1870s and 1880s, the U.S. economy rose at the fastest rate in its history, with real wages, wealth, GDP, and capital formation all increasing rapidly. Capitalizing on the economic boom were America's first millionaires like J.P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, Cornelius Vanderbilt - now regarded as the first success stories in the steel, oil and finance industries. And they weren't the only flourishing industries. Between 1865 and 1898, the output of wheat increased by 256 per cent, corn by 222 per cent, coal by 800 per cent and miles of railway track by 567 per cent. The growth was interrupted by a major nationwide depression known as the Panic of 1893.","'The Gilded Age' could air as early as Fall 2013 .

"May 13: the date in 1638 when construction began on the Red Fort in Delhi; the day in 1799 the Treaty of Teschen was signed to end the War of the Bavarian Succession. But, far more momentously, it is the date in 1983 that Yaya Toure was born in the Ivory Coast. Only the most loosely educated of us would fail to remember such a historic moment in the evolution of the human species. VIDEO Scroll down for Yaya Toure: My career's going great; going to City was the right move . Ambition: Toure has been linked with a return 'home' to Barcelona after a lack of respect from City . Comments: Toure's agent Dimitri Seluk has been in the public eye over the last week . Slice it up: The controversial cake . Monday night You missed his birthday . Seluk (Toure’s agent): He is upset. What happened at his birthday means the club don’t care about him. At City, Yaya is no hero. He’s nobody. He will leave if things carry on like this.12.25pm TuesdayThey didn’t shake his hand . Seluk: Yaya got a cake but when it was Roberto Carlos’s birthday, the president of Anzhi gave him a Bugatti. I don’t expect a Bugatti, we only asked that they shook his hand. The owners don’t care about him. It’s really sick.2.00pmYaya calms the storm . Thanks for all the birthday messages. Card from City just arrived... must have got lost in the post. Haha. Jokes aside. Please do not take words that do not come out of MY mouth seriously. Judge my commitment to  @MCFC by my performances.2.45pmYaya changes his mind . Everything Dimitry said is true. He speaks for me. I will give an interview after World Cup to explain.4.41pmHe wants more attention . Seluk: We don’t ask for money, we don’t ask for presents, we are only talking about attention. Yaya would be in the club for less money but more attention. 7pmHe just wants cake . Seluk: OK, Suarez wins best player. Yaya did not win. The club must say something, give a prize to him, a cake. Sadly, the miraculous birth slipped the minds of Manchester City’s  high-ups, factotums and players a week ago yesterday when Toure turned 31 — a landmark birthday, by any reckoning. There they all were, as guests of the club’s owner Sheik Mansour, in the St Regis Resort Hotel on Abu Dhabi’s Saadiyat Island. The Royal Suite there starts at £20,000 a night. The occasion? A celebration of City’s title victory. Running drinks — and who knows what else? — were laid on. But there was one almighty snag. There was no super car wrapped in ribbons for the birthday boy — and the cake with which he was presented was smaller than the one celebrating the league triumph. No wonder Toure’s agent, Dimitry Seluk, was the embodiment of injured outrage when he spoke to the media about this slight. Not only was Toure upset by this snub — diddums — but he is threatening to leave City over it, possibly to return to Barcelona. Taking umbrage would be risible even if City were not paying him £200,000 a week — or over £10million a year — to kick a ball rather well. Even in a game drunk on money and tarnished by preening popinjays, this act of vanity almost  carries the power to astonish. What Toure’s lickspittle forgot is that the fact his client is an outstanding midfielder does not stop him from looking preposterous. Perhaps realising the absurdity of his position, Toure at first tried to defuse the controversy in a bizarre series of messages on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon. ‘Thanks for all the birthday  messages today,’ he told his 439,000 lucky followers. ‘Card from City just arrived. Must have got lost in the post. Haha. ‘Jokes aside, please do not take words that do not come out of MY mouth seriously. Judge my  commitment to MCFC by my performances.’ But, 35 minutes later, possibly after a phone call from Seluk, he had changed his mind. Two more tweets appeared, saying: ‘My agent was trying to make a point here on my behalf. Everything Dimitry said is true. He speaks for me. I will give an  interview after the World Cup to explain.’ Sticking the knife in? Toure's cake was dwarfed by that of Manchester City's owners celebrating the title . Sliding in: Despite the outburst, Toure is paid handsomely by City, north of £200,000-a-week . It was never going to be easy for Toure to detach himself from Seluk’s complaints, which were made in a newspaper and followed up a few hours later on the BBC. The two men are exceptionally close. Toure calls the Ukrainian ‘dad’ and named his second child after him. The pair have a history of lacking self-awareness. Last year Seluk whined: ‘Around the stadium, while there are pictures of every player commemorating their recent  successes, there is not a single one of Yaya. ‘At the Blues club shop you can find shirts to buy with the name of every player, but not Yaya’s.’ City rightly denied the slur, pointing to huge posters of Toure around the Etihad and replica shirts in his honour. Yet Seluk continued: ‘This is not about money; a pat on the back is more important than anything.’ This is nonsense, of course. The principal reason Toure signed for City was money (just as it was with Carlos Tevez, David Silva and  Sergio Aguero). He wants the  adulation on the side. Fast car: Seluk noted that Roberto Carlos was bought a Bugatti by Russian club Anzhi on his birthday . Seluk was at it again when Toure was named African Footballer of the Year. Where, he demanded to know, was the private jet City should have laid on? Seluk is like a broken record. Last year he was threatening Toure would leave City, citing ‘many  reasons’, among them the notion his client did not ‘feel the respect of the staff’. Rewind 12 months to May 2012 and Seluk said: ‘Toure has done all he can do at City and needs new motivations. He would like a new challenge.’ Ego-mad players and greedy agents are only part of the problem. Another is clubs indulging their whims. Liverpool did that with Luis  Suarez when he was in disgrace for biting an opponent. Manchester United accommodated Wayne Rooney’s posturing demands. City tolerated Mario Balotelli for longer than his insolence deserved. It would be amusing — as well as a blow for sanity — if City gave Toure his cake and candles and sent him on his way to earn a fortune somewhere else, somewhere more appreciative, more caring.

"Former Doctor Who star Matt Smith and his ex-girlfriend Daisy Lowe appear to have become the latest victims of hackers who have leaked naked photographs of celebrities online. The pair join a long list of stars including Jennifer Lawrence, Avril Lavigne and Rihanna whose personal pictures are believed to have been posted online by anonymous bloggers. Smith, who quit his role as the timelord last year, dated former model Lowe for several years but the pair have since split up. So far, the images - which were first leaked in August - have involved women. But this week, the fourth bout of images were released and were said to include pictures of the first male victim, Nick Hogan, son of Hulk. The fourth wave of leaked images comes one week after a lawyer for more than a dozen targeted celebrities issued Google with a threat to sue for $100 million. Scroll down for video . Ex Doctor Who star Matt Smith and his ex-girlfriend Daisy Lowe are the latest victims of hackers who have released naked photos of celebrities . The firm threatened action due to Google 'making millions and profiting from the victimisation of women'. This week, Hollywood star Jennifer Lawrence also broke her silence to hit out at the leak of the naked pictures. The Oscar-winner, one of the most high-profile victims of the hacking of hundreds of explicit images, said it was a 'sex crime'. She told Vanity Fair magazine that anyone who looked at the images 'should cower with shame'. The 24-year-old told the magazine that she started to write a statement, but realised she had nothing to apologise for. She said: 'I was in a loving, healthy, great relationship for four years. It was long distance, and either your boyfriend is going to look at porn or he's going to look at you.' She told Vanity Fair: 'Just because I'm a public figure, just because I'm an actress, does not mean that I asked for this. Smith (left) and Lowe (right) join a long list of stars including Avril Lavigne, Cat Deeley and Rihanna whose pictures were said to have been posted online . 'It does not mean that it comes with the territory. It's my body, and it should be my choice, and the fact that it is not my choice is absolutely disgusting. I can't believe that we even live in that kind of world.' Lawrence called for a change in the law to prevent more leaks and added: 'It is not a scandal. It is a sex crime. It is a sexual violation. It's disgusting. 'I just can't imagine being that detached from humanity. I can't imagine being that thoughtless and careless and so empty inside.' She added: 'Anybody who looked at those pictures, you're perpetuating a sexual offence.' Many have surmised that the controversy may be coming to a close given the lower profile of the hacker's latest victims. But photos from an unreleased and potentially massive collection of stolen celebrity nudes can still be bought online for $350, evidence shows. Some say this summer's celebrity nude leaks were only a peak at how many photos and videos were compromised through security flaws in Apple's iCloud and other platforms. Scandal: Jennifer Lawrence - one of dozens of other stars who had naked photos leaked online - has broken her silence over the scandal, calling it a 'sex crime' The latest hits will come as a blow to Apple as the tech firm desperately tries to tighten security on the iCloud. It currently allows users to attempt access to any account an unlimited amount of times. The FBI and Apple, which runs iCloud, are already investigating the hacking in which dozens of celebrities’ accounts were infiltrated. Naked pictures of stars were put online by hackers linked to the notorious online forum 4chan. The first wave of explicit, personal images were released on August 31, featuring Jennifer Lawrence, Kirsten Dunst, and Kate Upton. Since, images have surfaced of singers Rihanna and Avril Lavigne, TV actress Kaley Cuoco, American goalkeeper Hope Solo, and socialities Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton. Taking action: Some of the female celebrities who have been targeted the photo hacking scandal - with Rihanna (left) and Amber Heard (right) among the most recent victims - are threatening to sue Google . Victims: Naked images already released are alleged to feature actress Vanessa Hudgens (left) and TV actress Kaley Cuoco (right) Another huge wave of leaked images took place around September 20 and involved nude photos of Kim Kardashian, Vanessa Hudgens, Kate Bosworth and Hope Solo all being released. The hackers also managed to steal pictures of Aubrey Plaza, Hayden Panetierre and Vanessa Hudgens in similar compromising positions. Also among the victims was British model Cara Delevingne. The blogger has also threatened to target Emma Watson - and created a website called Emma You Are Next - after she gave a feminist talk at the UN. Reddit closed the forum titled Fappening, a lewd reference to masturbation, a week after the first hit after receiving a warning that the images violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). But the images have been cached by thousands of users all over the world and shared on other blogs and websites, meaning many still appear on Google Images. First male victim: Reality TV star Nick Hogan, son of wrestler Hulk Hogan, was said to be the hacker's first victim . Marty Singer, half of Lavely & Singer law firm in Los Angeles, California, is now persuing legal action on behalf of a number of A-list victims. Singer claims he also issued more than a dozen warning letters to Google but received no response. In a letter to Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Singer accused the pair of 'blatantly unethical behavior'. Reacting to the potential lawsuit, Google said they have been trying to eradicate the photos from the web in response to complaints about privacy violation. 'We've removed tens of thousands of pictures -- within hours of the requests being made -- and we have closed hundreds of accounts,' a Google spokeman said. Threats: A website was set up titled Emma You Are Next but the images of Emma Watson never surfaced . Apple has denied that its iCloud system was compromised during the attacks, which were the result of 'a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions'. The firm, which said it was 'outraged' by the security breach, has now advised worried customers to update their accounts with a 'strong' password and enable two-step verification. Last month, during a previous leak of stolen, naked pictures, Twitter said it was shutting down accounts disseminating the images. In response to a request for comment, a Twitter spokesman said in August: 'We do not comment on individual accounts, for privacy and security reasons,' and referred MailOnline to the company's content boundaries web page.","They join long list of stars whose pictures were said to have been posted .

"CBS boss Len Moonves has spoken out about the extraordinary rant unleashed by by Angus T Jones on the set of Two and a Half Men and admitted that they now have 'other plans' for the show. Jones, who branded the show 'filth' in a now viral religious video, is thought to want to show up for the rest of his schedule after January there have been murmurs show bosses are not keen to have him back for a new season as a main character. And now Moonves has confirmed that they're resolving the issue of the 19-year-old's status. In the video the young star laughs as he admits his worried family have described his recent 'awakening' to the Seventh-day Adventist movement as a 'cult'... but whatever it is, it appears to have lost him his job . 'I don't know what our status is with him,' Moonves told the Wall Street Journal. 'We took this boy who started with us . when he was eight years old, and it seemed to be what happens with . child stars over the course of time. 'He's now making $300,000 per week, . which is not a bad salary for a 19-year-old kid, and he went on a . religious channel and urged people not to watch the show because it was . filth. By the way, he's still collecting his $300,000 a week,' Moonves . laughed. And when asked if they were looking . for another 'half man,' Moonves replied, 'We have other plans. I don't . think it's quite been resolved, but after going through what we went . through with Charlie Sheen, this is a piece of cake.' Candid: CBS president Moonves said dealing with Jones was 'a piece of cake' compared to Sheen and confirmed they are resolving the situation . And it might not be too hard for the show to 'resolve' Jones the way of Sheen as EW are reporting that if he had the typical non-disparagement clause in his contract, he's obviously in violation. A source close to the star told People: 'Angus expects to report to work after the holiday break in January. 'He intends to honor his contract through the end of the season.' Jones' character Jake joined the army at the end of season 9 and has only appeared in a few episodes of the current season. 'He won't be in every episode,' the source added says of the remaining season 10 episodes. How he was: Angus, seen here with ex-show star Charlie Sheen, has been on Two and a Half Men since he was a child . 'How much they use him will be up to [creator] Chuck Lorre. The intention wasn't ever for him to be in every ep this year anyway. Now it might be less.' Network CBS has yet to pick up the show for season 11. But sources told E!: 'Should Two and a Half Men be renewed, it's 'unlikely"" that Jones will return as a series regular. You might see him for a few guest spots.' Those closest to Angus, who is a Seventh Day Adventist, say the teenager doesn't want to risk turning into troubled Charlie Sheen so became involved in the church. Friends: Angus T Jones and his spiritual advisor Christopher Hudson share a joke . 'Part of the reason Angus is so wary of the [TV] industry and so involved with the church is that he's seen what's happened to Charlie [Sheen] front and center. 'He doesn't want to end up like that. Who would?', the family friend told E! Angus issued a statement apologising, in the most tenuous sense, for making a video branding Two and a Half Men 'filth' then entreating viewers to switch off from the show that made him both rich and famous. In his statement, Jones, 19, speaks up for his bosses on the CBS show, by saying: 'Chuck Lorre, Peter Roth and many others at Warner Bros. and CBS are responsible for what has been one of the most significant experiences in my life to date. Rant: Angus T Jones rages against his hit sitcom, calling it 'filth' The document obtained by TMZ continues: 'I thank them for the opportunity they have given and continue to give me and the help and guidance I have and expect to continue to receive from them.' Without actually taking back anything . he said, the teenager attempted to appease his cast: 'I apologise if my . remarks reflect me showing indifference to and disrespect of my . colleagues and a lack of appreciation of the extraordinary opportunity . of which I have been blessed. I never intended that.' Meanwhile, Christopher Hudson - the Seventh Day Adventist guiding Jones - denied that he was exploiting the actor, as the young star's mother Carey fears. Solace: Angus T Jones told how he found happiness at the Valley Crossroads Seventh-day Adventist Church in California . Hudson, who is believed to be in his 40s, confirmed that he recorded the video in the actor's trailer on the set of Two and A Half Men last week. Jones - who makes $350,000 per episode playing Jake Harper - was seen . urging fans to 'turn off' the show, saying it would damage their brains. And speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Hudson - who runs what he describes as a . christian-based ministry called the Forerunner Chronicles -  said Jones believes that Jesus Christ is returning to earth soon - and that he feels a strong urge to prepare others for the Second Coming. He said he had spoken to Jones since the video was made public, adding: 'I respect his . mother and the love she has for her child and her need to protect him. She is concerned about his well being as are many other people. 'But Angus has not had a breakdown and I am not manipulating him. He said let's do an interview - and I turned on the camera. 'Angus is a very educated, thoughtful young man. What was expressed in the video was from the sincere heart of a young man. 'I didn't encourage him to do anything.

"Lou Vincent and Naved Arif face life bans from cricket after being charged by the ECB with corruption offences relating to two county matches in 2011. The news follow revelations in Sportsmail about Vincent’s involvement with match-fixing, with the ECB bringing 14 charges against the former New Zealand Test batsman. Those charges relate to a pair of now infamous games three years ago for Sussex: a T20 match against Lancashire and a 40-over clash with Kent. In the spotlight: Lou Vincent, who is currently being investigated by the ICC, will also be charged with alleged match fixing by the ECB . Arif, a 32-year-old left-arm seamer born in Punjab, who was playing for Sussex as a non-overseas player because of his Danish wife, has been charged with six offences relating to the game against Kent. Both men have been provisionally suspended from all cricket, and could be banned for life if they are found guilty by a tribunal. It is understood that additional evidence could be used from the T20 game between Lancashire and Durham in 2008. Lancashire opener Mal Loye last week told Sportsmail that Vincent — his fellow opener in that game — offered him £20,000 to score fewer than 10. Loye refused. Chris Watts, head of the ECB’s anti-corruption unit, said: ‘This matter is now the subject of formal legal proceedings and we will therefore make no further comment other than to reiterate our determination to bring to account the very small minority who seek to corrupt cricket.’ Co-accused: Former Sussex seamer Naved Arif is also set to be charged with match-fixing . The ICC’s own Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) had investigated the Sussex-Kent game, but found no evidence to back up suspicions raised by unusual betting patterns. Over £14million was wagered on betting exchanges — more than twice the usual amount for a televised county game. The ACSU reopened their investigation of Vincent following his appearances for Auckland Aces at the Champions League in South Africa in October 2012, and passed on their information to the ECB. Last night, Arif’s solicitors released a statement saying: ‘In view of Mr Arif’s right to a fair hearing before the Anti-Corruption Tribunal, we do not intend to make any further comment at this juncture.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Charges relate to 40-over match against Kent in 2011 .

"Danny Cipriani will be on the plane on Tuesday when England's advance party fly to Auckland to prepare for the first Test, but he won't be in the starting line-up. Barring a fundamental shift in management thinking over the next week, Freddie Burns will emerge from a season of personal trials and tribulations to start the series opener against the All Blacks at Eden Park. In the enforced absence of Owen Farrell and Stephen Myler - due to fixture congestion - and the injured George Ford, the 24-year-old Burns will be thrust into the No 10 shirt and entrusted with the playmaker's role in a selection decision based more on familiarity than form. Backing: Freddie Burns will emerge from a tough season to start for England against the All Blacks . Burns has been a regular fixture in the national set-up for two years, although his last Test appearance was on tour in  Argentina last June. Since then, his game has collapsed during the protracted saga of his move from Gloucester to Leicester, to the point where he was often an unused replacement for the West Country club with Billy Twelvetrees taking over at fly-half. Yet he is destined to be selected in Auckland ahead of Cipriani, who was included in the initial group of 30 players flying from Heathrow to prepare for the first encounter with the world champions at a venue where they are unbeaten since 1994. This first batch of players will be supplemented next week by those involved in Saturday's Aviva  Premiership final. Last week, England head coach Stuart Lancaster recalled Cipriani - who last played for his country in 2008 - but he gave clear indications that Burns remains above him in the No 10 hierarchy. 'Danny has played well on a number of occasions, but there are areas of his game he could do better,' he said. 'I wouldn't go so far as to say that the (form) difference between the two has been vast. 'I think Freddie found some form towards the end of the season. Equally, there were one or two other players who hadn't played well for their clubs coming into the  England side for the Six Nations who managed to deliver great performances. Recall: Fly-half Danny Cipriani last played for England in 2008 . DANNY CIPRIANI . Age: 26. Height: 6ft 0inWeight: 14st 2lbClub: Sale Sharks (joined 2012)Former clubs: London Wasps(2004-10), MelbourneRebels (2011-12)England appearances: 7England points: 49England debut: won33-10 v Ireland, March 2008 . FREDDIE BURNS . Age: 24. Height: 6ft 1inWeight: 13st 10lbClub: Leicester Tigers (from June 1)Former clubs: Gloucester (2007-14)England appearances: 3England points: 37England debut: won 38-21 vNew Zealand, December 2012 . 'Ben Morgan is a good example and Billy Twelvetrees - both playing for the same club (as Burns). You back your coaches, you back your  system and your ability to get the best out of people. 'Form is temporary. You can regenerate form and belief in a player if you put them in the right environment. Once Freddie became aware of the opportunity in front of him, he has stood up as I expected him to and led the team.' Assessing Cipriani, Lancaster added: 'He's been quite quiet actually off the field. I don't know what the perception is but certainly he's quite quiet. He's been very diligent in making sure he's up to speed with learning the plays and calls. 'On the field it is a slightly different way of attack that we've generated here, different from the way he's been coached before. I think he's enjoyed that part of the reintroduction to the England team, working with Mike Catt and Andy Farrell in particular. 'He's been good on the field, growing in . terms of his presence and leadership, because obviously as fly-half you . have to have a voice, you have to be able to boss people around. I think . his game's improving in that way as well. He's a little bit behind . Freddie in that regard because Freddie has had so much time and . experience with us over the last two years. Challenge: Tour has started on the back foot for England coach Stuart Lancaster . 'Even though Freddie hasn't played as many games for us in the last two years as someone like Owen  (Farrell), he has been in the camp a long time, so as a consequence  he understands it a little bit better.' England's coaches are optimistic that Twelvetrees will have recovered from an ankle injury in time for the second Test in Dunedin,  perhaps even the first at a push. They are also refusing to rule out the seemingly remote prospect of first-choice hooker Dylan Hartley playing some part in the tour. 'My understanding is he is very, very . close now,' said Lancaster. 'We are sat here a week and a half away from . a first Test he wouldn't have played anyway (due to Northampton . commitments), and two-and-a-half weeks away from the  second Test. Impressive: James Haskell has been rewarded for fine end-of-season form with England call . 'There's a very good chance he's going to be ready by that point. You have a player of that experience available to us in a position where we've lost some experience, so if he came through this weekend, I'd be reasonably certain he'll be on the plane.' James Haskell has been rewarded for fine end-of-season form with a return to the ranks, while  Worcester full back Chris Pennell is in the mix for a Test debut as Anthony Watson of Bath is  struggling with a suspected hamstring strain. Lancaster and his assistants are awaiting medical bulletins  concerning Farrell and Mako Vunipola, and they must hope to avoid any mishaps involving their scrum-halves, fly-halves or loosehead props, given the presence of just two men in each position in the squad departing today.","Burns will be thrust into the No 10 shirt in enforced absence of Owen Farrell and Stephen Myler .

"Polish goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski has signed a four-year deal with Swansea after agreeing to leave Arsenal at the end of his contract. The 29-year-old will officially become a Swansea player on July 1 when his deal at the Emirates finishes. Fabianksi, who has won 21 caps for his country, becomes Garry Monk's first signing since he was named the club's permanent manager. New boy: Lukasz Fabianski proudly holds a Swansea scarf after signing a four-year deal with the Welsh club . All smiles: Fabianski lifts the FA Cup after helping Arsenal overcome Hull 3-2 in extra-time . The former Legia Warsaw stopper, who joined the Gunners for £2million in 2007, spent the majority of his time in north London as Arsene Wenger's second choice keeper. His last act as an Arsenal player was to help the club end their nine-year trophy drought by winning the FA Cup final against Hull in extra-time. Fabianski will provide competition for Michel Vorm and Gerhard Tremmel at the Liberty Stadium. Speaking to Swansea's official website, Fabianski said: 'I am very happy with the move, the decision and the club. I’m very excited for the coming season and the coming years. 'It will be a big honour to represent Swansea City. Everyone interested in football knows that Swansea is a proper football club. The way they play football is nice to watch and they have always been an exciting team. 'Based on what the club has achieved . in the three previous seasons in the Premier League, you can clearly see . that year upon year the club is moving forward. 'The club represents good values and the style of football is something that I would like to be a part of. 'I . know quite a bit about them already, but I am sure I will get to know . quite a bit more in the coming months. For me, it was an easy decision . to make to join the club. Safe hands: Fabianski keeps out Thomas Muller's penalty against Bayern Munich in the Champions League . Hero: Fabianski saves a penalty during Arsenal's FA Cup semi-final win against Wigan at Wembley . 'If I'm completely honest, the main reason I came to Swansea was because I want to be the number one goalkeeper. I want to play week in, week out. 'It's going to be a real fight, but I'm not afraid of that. Competition is always good, so I think everyone will take positives from that. 'I'm excited. I've already asked for the pre-season programme to see how it looks. I'm really looking forward to starting with my new team-mates and I think it's going to be a fantastic new chapter in my life. 'I will be working hard for the club, giving everything every single day. I can promise that.'","Fabianski has signed a four-year deal at the Liberty Stadium .

"It is the technology that really could change the way we live (and shop). Apple Pay aims to replace cards with an iPhone 6, allowing shoppers to simply prove their identity with a fingerprint then tap to pay. Now, it has been claimed that owners will finally be able to throw away their wallets on October 20th. Scroll down for video . Apple Pay aims to replace cards with a system that uses the Passbook credit card-storage app and fingerprint ID security system. Tim Cook presented the Apple Pay at the company's launch event in Cupertino. Apple Pay is compatible with the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and the Apple Watch. The mobile system works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is simply made as if the user had presented and signed their card. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. According to Bank Innovation, this is when apple will release iOS 8.1, which contains the feature. 'Based on multiple sources close to Apple, Bank Innovation has learned that iOS 8.1 will include Apple Pay, and the current expected timetable for the public release is schedule for October 20,' the site said. Sources who spoke to Bank Innovation indicated that the public release of iOS 8.1 will be in sometime in October and may have improvements for other Apple services. It is believed the feature could be launched at an event were new iPads and Mac software will also be released. 'We expect that the iOS 8.1 release will be timed to the still-unconfirmed October event held by Apple to announce their new iPad devices, as other websites have previously reported and Bank Innovation has heard rumors about, as well.' Apple Pay is designed to let iPhone 6 and 6 Plus owners use their smartphones to pay for purchases at shops as well as online via apps. The service will also be available on Apple Watch. The mobile system works by holding phone up to a generic card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. Apple Pay is designed to let iPhone 6 and 6 Plus owners use their smartphones to pay for purchases at shops as well as online via apps. The service will also be available on Apple Watch (pictured) The NFC chip is fitted across the top of the phone. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. It uses the Passbook app and cards that are already on file with iTunes can be saved to it. Users can also take a picture of their own credit card and add it to the account. This is verified by the card’s bank before being accepted. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. This won’t cancel the cards, either, because the card details themselves are not stored on that device. 'Apple doesn't know what you bought, where you bought it, and how much you bought it for,’ said Apple's senior vice president of internet software and services Eddy Cue. It will be launched in the US in October, . and Apple said it is 'working hard' on bringing it to the UK, although a . date has yet to be announced. The Cupertinpo-based firm says it's easier and more secure than using a credit or debit card. However, some experts have raised concerns over the system's security. One of the major security concerns is in the way Apple will let people add a different credit card to their phone, so it can be used instead as the one the company has on file. Some of the largest retailers are not participating. Wal-Mart said it has no plans to participate. To add a card, a user will take a picture of it with their iPhone and send it to an Apple data centre. There it will be verified it with their bank before it gets added to the user's Passbook. However, it is unclear how the image is stored securely on the phone and how it is transmitted to prevent a criminal from intercepting it public Wi-Fi. Cue said credit card information will be stored on the phone via a secure chip and payments will use a one-time security code. The Find My iPhone service can erase the data if the phone gets lost or stolen - cancelling a card will not be necessary. The service will be able to store Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit card information. 'A cashier doesn't see your name, credit card number or security code,' when you pay with Apple Pay, Cue said. He also said Apple won't track people's financial data. 'Apple doesn't know what you bought, where you bought it or how much you paid,' he said. 'That transaction is between you, your merchant and your bank.' 'One security concern is that there is at least one new participant in the payment transaction which creates another point of attack– the handset manufacturer and network operator,' Richard Moulds, vice president of strategy at Thales e-Security told MailOnline. 'In the past the only participants were the merchant, the merchant’s bank and you own bank. 'Apple is stating that it will not know the details of individual transactions which is very important but there is clearly the risk of attacks on the phone itself. 'No security measure is perfect and attackers around the world will now make cracking Apple Pay their number one challenge.' Eddy Cue (pictured), Apple's senior vice president of Internet software and services, said credit card information will be stored on the phone via a secure chip and payments will use a one-time security code . Apple said shops like Macy's and Bloomingdales, drugstores including Walgreen's and Duane Reade, and other stores including McDonald's, Staples, Subway and Whole Foods are participating in Apple Pay. But some of the largest retailers are not participating. Wal-Mart said it has no plans to participate. Amazon.com did not respond to a request for comment. And Target said it is currently participating only via its app.","Apple Pay uses Passbook credit card-storage app and Touch ID security .

"Rory McIlroy suffered a disastrous second round at the Memorial Tournament in Ohio as three consecutive double bogeys and three bogeys saw him tumble down the leaderboard. The Northern Irishman led by three shots after a nine-under-par 63 in the first round to continue his good form after victory in last week's BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth. But, after starting on the back nine, McIlroy reached the turn in 43 strokes - 12 shots worse than on Thursday. His change of fortune coincided with . former fiancée Caroline Wozniacki having updated her picture on Twitter . to that of her stirring a cauldron. Round from hell: Rory McIlroy lost the lead after a second round 78 at the Memorial Championship, Ohio . In form: McIlroy had arrived in Ohio after winning the BMW PGA Championships in Wentworth . Spellbound: Caroline Wozniacki updated her picture on Twitter to that of her stirring a cauldron . England's Paul Casey stormed into a three-shot lead after a second successive six-under-par round of 66, which included an eagle, six birdies and just the two dropped shots, left him on 12 under for the tournament and with clear daylight to the chasing pack heading into the weekend. 'I was ecstatic with the way I played,' Casey said on www.pgatour.com. 'There was a couple of mistakes in there but that's Muirfield Village. It's a tricky golf course and you don't need to do a lot wrong to make a mistake.' In second spot, three shots back after a 69 is Bubba Watson, while Chris Kirk is a further shot adrift in third after a second-round 70. Casey, Watson and Kirk were all joint second following the first day, which was dominated by McIlroy. The Northern Irishman boasted a three-shot advantage of his own after shooting a brilliant 63 as he continued the form he showed in winning the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth on Sunday. However, the 25-year-old had a day to forget on Friday as he carded a six-over-par 78 to tumble down the leaderboard. Great Dane: Thorbjorn Olesen has taken the lead in Ohio at six under par after the second round . Most of the . damage was done on a disastrous opening nine where three consecutive . double bogeys saw him go out in 43 at Muirfield Village. Starting . on the back nine, McIlroy bogeyed his opening hole, the par-four 10th, . before parring 11 and picking the shot back up on 12. It . went rapidly downhill after that, though, as double bogeys followed on . 13, 14 and 15 before two pars and a further bogey saw him reach the turn . four shots off the lead. That . represented a 12-shot collapse on the back nine from Thursday where he . had picked up two eagles, three birdies and a double bogey to record a . 31. McIlroy . did manage to turn things round a bit on the back nine though, picking . up birdies on the second and seventh while only dropping the one shot in . between as he ended the day on three under par overall. Frontrunner: England's Paul Casey stormed into a three-shot lead after a second successive 66 . Despite . that partial recovery though, McIlroy found himself nine shots behind . Casey at the end of the day as the 36-year-old Englishman enjoyed . another good round in Ohio. McIlroy hurt his knee during Thursday's round, but he insisted it did not affect him too badly on Friday. He . said: 'The knee's OK. It was a little bit sore this morning on the . range but out on the course it was fine, the painkillers kicked in. I . felt it a little bit but it didn't really bother me too much. 'I . missed fairways, that was a big thing, I didn't realise how thick the . rough was until I got into it today. Obviously that three-hole stretch, . 13, 14, 15, didn't help.

"Would you pay £1.3m to be kidnapped in front of your colleagues, trained in weaponry by ex-SAS soldiers, and take part in a covert operation across several countries? Individuals with money to burn are getting to live out their secret-agent fantasies in the ultimate travel experience. Special Operations Agency is a team of ex-SAS, SBS and SIS members who have joined forces to provide unprecedented access to Special-Forces and Secret-Service training. Be like Bond: A new experience offers unprecedented access to Special-Forces and Secret-Service training . Secret mission: Participants are flown to secret locations to be trained in weaponry and combat . It is the first company to offer civilians the chance to be trained for and complete covert missions, which take place across eastern Europe and America. Depending on the operation, clients can experience thrilling helicopter rides, combat situations, dealing with explosives and hostage rescue. The sky is the limit for the most extravagant package offered by the company - called Operation Connery. Costing £165,000 per head for a minimum of eight people, it will take you on a four-day mission across Europe. Secret agent style: You'll complete search and rescue missions and have shoot-outs with bad guys . Past participants have experienced a boat chase from Nice to Monaco, where they received a briefing from an M-style character and a glamorous evening at the casino. Over the next few days, they arrive in the Czech Republic by helicopter and jet into the Swiss mountains. They jump out of cars and experience choreographed shoot-outs with the bad guys, all in a bid to get their imaginary '007-status'. Mission complete: At the end, guests are rewarded with a lavish Bond-style party . Special Operations Agency MD Sean Crawford tells MailOnline Travel that the missions transforms grown men and women into children again. 'It's an adrenaline ride,' he says. 'The ultimate high.' One high net-worth client from Russia paid £2m to arrange for members of their staff - some unaware it was not real - to be taken on a cat and mouse chase across America. The Special Operations Agency filtered faux threats to the company, kidnapped one employee, and trained the team in a search and rescue mission that ended in a lavish Bond-style party. Safety first: Thorough briefing and training will prepare guests for any scenario . Not just for the boys: Company MD Sean Crawford reveals that women tend to be the best shots . The cherry on top of an already astounding experience is delivery of 'the ultimate goodie bag' by Union Jack parachute. It's not just for the boys, in fact, Crawford reveals that in his experience, 'women tend to be the best shots'. And it's also not just for the mega-wealthy. Realising that there is a market for a secret-agent experiences with a more modest budget, the Agency has introduced a range of 'operations' that cost just under £3,000. Taking place in European sites near Prague and Vienna, the two-day packages will offer guests the chance to experience weaponry training and combat scenarios - and they don't sacrifice the glamorous after-party. Operations retain an air of mystery, so participants don't know exactly what they can expect before embarking on missions. Extravagant: The most expensive mission, Operation Connery, costs upwards of £165,000 a head . 'Ultimate high': The idea came when Crawford witnessed participants in firearms training 'buzzing like kids' The idea came about several years ago when Crawford was instructing at a firearms school in Hereford, while his partner, Carl Leonard, was training Daniel Craig in pistols on the set of Casino Royale. 'I watched students buzzing like little kids,' Crawford says. They realised there was a market for secret agent-style courses. It took several years for the idea to be realised; the recession putting plans on hold.The high-rolling City boys and their toys who were their target market tamed their spending habits, but the past year has seen demand for extravagant experiences skyrocket again. Don't expect free reign with a rifle though - safety is paramount, and Crawford stresses that every combat situation is strictly choreographed. 'Nobody actually moves with a loaded weapon,' he insists.","Missions bespoke tailored to suit your secret agent fantasy .

"Real Madrid star Gareth Bale could be handed the Wales captaincy for next month's friendly against Holland in Amsterdam. Wales manager Chris Coleman is without international skippers Aaron Ramsey and Ashley Williams, who are both rested from the June 4 encounter. And while Coleman is keeping his cards close to his chest about who will lead Wales against the World Cup-bound Dutch, it is thought that 24-year-old Bale is in pole position. VIDEO: Scroll down for Bale: It's been an exciting campaign and we'll be 100% ready . Thumbs up: Gareth Bale in preparation for Saturday's Champions League final with Real Madrid . Arrival: The world's most expensive footballer could be handed the Wales captaincy next month . Key men: He and Cristiano Ronaldo will be spearheading Real Madrid's hopes of a 10th European title . He has already won the Copa del Rey in his first season with Real, scoring a spectacular winning goal to defeat Barcelona, while he will be part of an all-Spanish Champions League final against Atletico Madrid in Lisbon on Saturday. 'I have got the captain, but he does not know it yet. He will know it soon,' said Coleman, after naming a 23-man squad for the Holland clash. 'There will be another captain, and I will have that conversation with him.' Coleman believes the Dutch game will be ""an invaluable experience"" despite being without several key players. Arsenal's FA Cup final hero Ramsey, Swansea captain Williams, Burnley's Sam Ricketts and West Ham defender James Collins are among the absentees, while reserve goalkeeper Boaz Myhill has confirmed his retirement from international football. Coleman, though, has Bale at his disposal, while there is also a chance for promising uncapped young talent like Manchester United's Tom Lawrence and Hull defender James Chester. Welsh heart: The 24-year-old already has 44 caps for his national team . Prize assets: He and Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey are the jewels in Chris Coleman's crown . 'We have been building, doing well and picking up momentum and this is another game and another chance for us,' he added. 'As an international manager, you want to climb the rankings, and to do that you need some results against some juicy teams. You can arrange friendly games against weaker opposition, and while it looks good that you've won a game, you don't learn a lot and you don't go anywhere in the rankings. 'We have tried to pick strong opposition, and they don't come much stronger than this one. It will be good for us. 'If we lose more (players), then we do. We have to get on with it, but the lads there will get the experience against a very good Dutch team going to the World Cup, and it will be an invaluable experience. 'Normally, I wouldn't take a game (on June 4), but it's Holland in Amsterdam. We took it also because this time next year we will be preparing for Belgium in a (European Championship) qualifier, so there are two reasons why we took the game.' Ramsey will be rested after a season that saw him sidelined for four months with a thigh injury, before making his comeback towards the campaign's latter stages, along with the likes of Collins, Williams and Williams' Swansea colleague Ben Davies. Rested: Swansea pair Ben Davies and Ashley Williams will miss the game as they need to rest . Finalist: James Chester started, and scored, in the 3-2 FA Cup loss against Arsenal at Wembley . Decisions: Coleman will be hoping to lead the Welsh team to Euro 2016 . 'We had a . good conversation,' said Coleman, regarding Ramsey. 'We thought he can . come with us (to Holland), but we think he needs a good rest. 'He . is a loss, of course he is, and we are a better team when he is with . us, that's obvious. But we didn't want to take the risk, neither did . Aaron, nor Arsenal, I would have thought. 'Ben Davies and Ashley Williams have got the same problem (injury) and they need a good rest. 'They . rarely miss games or training, they've got great attitudes, it's just . they have finished the season with Swansea and now they need rest with . the injuries that they've got.' Uncapped Chester, meanwhile, played in Hull's FA Cup final defeat against Arsenal last weekend, when Ramsey scored the winning goal, although Tigers boss Steve Bruce then said his player would not be available to tackle Holland. 'We will not be taking the risk,' Coleman said. 'If there is a problem we will not risk him, simple as that. 'But I spoke to Brucey [Steve Bruce] and James last week and we are looking forward to having him. He is another member of the squad, another Premier League player which we think will help and improve us. 'We cannot say he is coming in and he will definitely start. He will need to come through the sessions, and we will see how he is.'","Gareth Bale could be handed Wales captaincy in international friendly against Holland .

"Luis Suarez is in a fight to face England at the World Cup after having surgery on a knee injury on Thursday. The Liverpool striker’s participation in Brazil was thrown into doubt when he was hurt during a training session with Uruguay in the capital Montevideo on Thursday morning. Initial fears were that he could be sidelined for months rather than weeks. Uruguay wasted no time sending Suarez for an operation and he had the procedure late in the afternoon. Stricken: Suarez had to be wheeled out of hospital on Thursday night after his operation . In the spotlight: The Liverpool striker is mobbed by fans as he leaves the hospital . Shock: The news of Suarez's injury came as a big surprise on Thursday morning . Swarm: A large crowd gather around Suarez as he leaves hospital in Montevideo after being operated on . Transport: Journalists, photographers and fans surround the ambulance carrying Suarez . Hordes of media and fans were gathered . outside the Medica Uruguaya hospital as a hooded Suarez was escorted . through in a wheelchair. Uruguay . team doctor Alberto Pan is due to hold a press conference on Friday when he . will provide an update on the injury and the success of the operation. Liverpool . have been kept informed and are confident the treatment he is receiving . is correct. There are no plans to send any club medical staff out to . oversee his rehabilitation. Although . it is unlikely he will be ready to face Costa Rica in Uruguay’s Group D . opener in Fortaleza on June 14, it is hoped he could face England in . Sao Paulo five days later. A . Uruguay Football Association statement said: ‘Luis Suarez after the . normal warm-up felt an intense pain in his left knee. An MRI scan . confirmed partial lesion of the external meniscus. ‘He had an arthroscopy with a partial resection of the meniscus. His participation in the World Cup is not ruled out.’ Familiar face: Suarez is still a chance to play against his Liverpool team-mates when Uruguay take on England . Media scrum: Press wait outside the hospital where Suarez was being treated on Thursday . The scene: A view of the facade of the Medica Uruguaya hospital where Suarez was operated on . It . was also claimed Suarez suffered the injury in the final game of the . season, when he was tackled by Newcastle’s Paul Dummett. That led . Uruguay fans to send online death threats to Dummett, who was sent off . for the challenge but later had the decision rescinded. Suarez . is upbeat about his prospects and before entering hospital told El Pais . newspaper: ‘Take it easy because I’m going to make it (to the World . Cup) and will work very hard these days to be at 100 per cent and help . out my team-mates.’ Such . is Suarez’s importance to Uruguay that local reporters even contacted . his mother for a diagnosis. She informed them: ‘Everything went well. What Luis had wasn’t as serious as we thought. He’s going to play in the . World Cup.’ Year to remember: Suarez scored an incredible 31 goals in 33 Premier League games last season . The thought . of missing out on Brazil would leave Suarez distraught and Brendan . Rodgers once gave an insight into the 27-year-old’s character, saying: . ‘He’d play football all week, all day and night, if he could. He is a . worker, a grafter and lives for football.’ Had . Suarez suffered medial ligament damage, as was initially feared, he . would have been looking at a lay-off of up to 16 weeks. That would have . made him a doubt for the start of the new Premier League campaign. Former . Liverpool striker Fernando Torres suffered meniscus damage during a . Europa League game in April 2010 before the World Cup in South Africa. He managed to get himself fit within seven weeks but, arguably, the rush of getting himself back into contention took its toll.","Suarez had surgery on a knee injury at a hospital in Montevideo on Thursday .

"It is a charming image that might well tempt a traveller to visit. It’s just a pity that British Airways used a picture of Leeds Castle, in Kent, to advertise flights to the city of Leeds ... in Yorkshire. While the northern metropolis boasts many great attractions, Leeds Castle, some 200 miles away in Maidstone, isn’t one of them. The airline used an image of Leeds Castle in Maidstone, Kent, to advertise a getaway in Leeds, Yorkshire . So tourists who bought tickets based on the advert – emailed to the airline’s customers alongside promotions for New York and Berlin – might have been a little disappointed when they reached their destination. The case of mistaken identity was spotted by BA customer Ian Guildford, 48. He said: ‘At first I thought, “Where’s that?”. I was thinking it might be somewhere in North or West Yorkshire that I hadn’t visited yet. ‘Then I thought, “That’s Leeds Castle”. I double-checked on the internet and there it was, the very same picture, in Maidstone, Kent.’ He pointed out that it would be easier to visit the castle from Heathrow, near London, than from the city of Leeds. Off base: The airline has apologised for the 'silly mistake' and reassured customers pilots had 'no trouble' locating Leeds . The city of Leeds in Yorkshire is some 200 miles away (pictured). The blunder was pointed out by baffled customers . Mr Guildford, the director of a company that makes match programmes for Leeds United football club, added: ‘It’s one of those things that everyone worries about – that companies have a very London-based, South-based view of our country. ‘So when our national carrier doesn’t even know where Leeds Castle is, it makes you worry. I know that Leeds has a great deal to offer, but not that particular castle.’ In fact, the castle’s name has nothing to do with the city of Leeds, although it is linked to Leeds village, which is near Maidstone. The word leeds, in this case, derives from esledes – an old English word meaning slope or hillside. There has been a castle on the site since 1119. British Airways owned up to the error last night. A spokesman said: ‘We’re sorry for the silly mistake. Fortunately our pilots have no trouble at all recognising Leeds.’","British Airways advertised a getaway to the city with image of Leeds Castle .

"An elderly woman was killed when she was run over by a bin lorry. The pensioner was crossing the road outside the shop in The Shambles in Worcester when the vehicle pulled away without seeing her, trapping her beneath its wheels. Emergency services arrived at the scene but were unable to save the woman who has not yet been named. An elderly woman died after being hit by a bin lorry as it collected rubbish from an Argos in Worcester . A local shop-owner who witnessed the tragedy said: 'They had both been collecting rubbish from Argos and were parked up behind each other. 'But one pulled away as the old lady was walking between the two of them, and its gone into her pretty hard. She’s then gone under the wheels. 'She didn’t stand a chance but it looked like a complete accident. The driver couldn’t see her but he looked really shaken. It’s an absolute tragedy. 'The road is only pedestrianised after 10am, which seems wrong really as its gets busy with people way before then. 'It’s only a narrow street and we’ve said its only a matter of time before somebody gets hurt or killed with lorries going along it at that time of the morning. Passers-by watched on in horror as the elderly woman, who has not been named, became trapped under the lorry's wheels . The shop in Worcester remained closed for the rest of the day as staff were left shocked by the tragedy . 'Maybe the council will think twice about changing that now a poor old lady has lost her life in this way.' A spokesman for West Mercia Police said: 'The Shambles remained closed to traffic while the crash investigation team carried out its work examining the evidence. 'We are now working to identify the victim and inform the next of kin, after which we will be able to release details about her identity.' The street was cordoned off between as crash investigation officers conducted inquiries. An ambulance, a responder paramedic and a paramedic area support officer also attended the scene. The waste management company, which is not run by the council, was collecting rubbish from Argos . A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokeswoman added: 'Upon arrival crews found a pedestrian, a woman, who had been in collision with a lorry.. 'Sadly, it quickly became apparent to ambulance staff that nothing could be done to save the woman and she was confirmed dead at the scene. 'Ambulance staff assessed several bystanders who were suffering from the effects of shock after witnessing the incident but no one required hospital treatment. 'The road remains closed by the police.' Worcester City Council confirmed the vehicle was not one of their fleet and said it was a commercial waste collection lorry. Argos remained closed for the rest of the day, with a spokesman saying: 'We offer our deepest sympathies to her family and are providing help and support to our colleagues affected by this tragic event.' Smith Waste Management, the company which the lorry belongs to, has been contacted by MailOnline.","The woman was crossing the road when the lorry pulled out and struck her .

"Striker Shola Ameobi is to leave Newcastle after 14 years at St James' Park. The 32-year-old is out of contract and after discussions with the club, will move on, although he has signalled his intention to return one day. Nigeria international Ameobi, who was handed a senior debut by former manager Sir Bobby Robson as a teenager, said: 'Following discussions with Newcastle United, both parties felt it was the right time for us to part company. Sho is over: Shola Ameobi is to leave Newcastle United after 14 years at the club . 'I have been at Newcastle United all my career and I have enjoyed every moment and always worn the famous shirt with pride. I am now looking forward to starting a new chapter in my career. 'I would like to place on record a big thank you to everyone at Newcastle United. I wish the club great success in the future and I'm sure with the team and management they have, Newcastle United will go from strength to strength. 'Finally, a big thank you to the supporters who have always been fantastic. I hope to come back to Newcastle United . one day in some capacity to help repay some of the faith and loyalty . that everybody connected to the club has shown me during my time here.' Ameobi, whose younger brother Sammy remains on the books, made 397 senior appearances, 178 of them as a substitute, and scored 79 goals. He was not always a favourite with the club's fans, but was appreciated by successive managers, none more so than current incumbent Alan Pardew. Staying put: Ameobi's brother Sammy, seen here shooting in a Europa League tie in 2012 for Newcastle, will stay at the club . Praise: Newcastle boss Alan Pardew paid tribute to Ameobi's service to the club . Pardew said: 'Such loyalty and commitment in the modern game is rare and Shola was not just a great player on the pitch, but a key figure off it too. 'He is a leader of men, a great role model for our younger players and I wish him well for the remainder of his career.' Ameobi is one nine men leaving the club along with loan pair Loic Remy and Luuk de Jong, midfielders Dan Gosling and Conor Newton, who have joined Bournemouth and Rotherham respectively, and youngsters Michael Richardson, Steven Logan, Brandon Miele and Jonathan Mitchell.","Newcastle striker Shola Amoebi will leave club after 14 years .

"Wayne Rooney admits he has one last shot at the biggest tournament of the lot. Rooney seems happy and relaxed here in Portugal — there was that touching moment at the end of an England training session when he ran over to kiss his four-year-old son Kai. But the serious stuff starts soon. Rooney insists that England will go to Brazil aiming to win the tournament and accepts this is his final realistic chance to make a major impact at a World Cup. Facing the press: Wayne Rooney speaks to the media during a press conference in Portugal . It was an issue his former team-mate Paul Scholes addressed on Thursday, even predicting Rooney’s possible retirement in his early thirties. At 28, Rooney knows the clock is ticking on his career. ‘At the World Cup in 2018, I’ll be older so it will be difficult to make an impact,’ Rooney admitted at England’s Portugal training base. ‘I want to show the world what I can do and this is the time do it. There will be no excuses. ‘This is the last big one that I feel will get the best out of me. I can deliver and this is the one where I have to show what I can do.’ So this really is it. Rooney’s last chance to rule the world. We have been here before, catapulting him into the same category as the Brazilian Ronaldo before the 2006 World Cup and Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo at the 2010 tournament in South Africa. Affection: Rooney ran over to kiss son Kai after an England training session at Vale Do Lobo on Wednesday . No-one will make the same mistake again. This time it’s up to Rooney to perform, to score his first goal at a World Cup and lead England out of their group. Goodness knows he has enough talent to do that. ‘The tournaments haven’t gone great for me but I’m hoping this one will. I feel fresh, I feel fit, I feel ready. ‘When you’re going into a tournament, you believe you’re going to do well, so you don’t really feel that pressure, but maybe inside you are feeling it, which you don’t realise. End in sight: Rooney admits Brazil 2014 could be his last chance to win the World Cup with England . ‘The World Cup is a tough tournament. I think for myself I want to go in and I want to prove myself at this level, which I haven’t been able to do before.’ There is a maturity about him and he revealed that he will meet the England team psychiatrist Steve Peters to ‘see if he can add an extra two per cent’ to his game. Rooney’s preparation is going smoothly so far. He arrived in Vale do Lobo a week early, posting Facebook videos of his workouts on the lush playing surface that lips one of the Algarve’s finest golf courses. Younger days: Rooney gestures during Germany 2006, the first World Cup tournament he played . There is a bit of Paul Gascoigne about the way in which he is squeezing all this extra fitness work into a short time frame before England’s World Cup warm-up with Peru at Wembley next Friday. Rooney missed the final three games of the season with Manchester United after his interim  manager Ryan Giggs accepted that he needed time to recover from a minor injury. He was a little irritated to be reminded of Sir Alex Ferguson’s claim in his autobiography that Rooney struggles to recover from injuries quickly — ‘he would say that’ — but that was the only time he bristled. Relaxed: Rooney looks chilled as he poses for the camera after a press conference in the Algarve . ‘In previous tournaments I’ve had little injuries which have stopped me training in the first week, so I’ve been delighted to start the first sessions.’ It is in these training sessions that Rooney has been impressed by the young players picked for England’s World Cup squad. Luke Shaw, Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley have all had outstanding seasons and merit their places in the squad. Sterling, in particular, was outstanding in Tuesday’s open training session. Star man: Raheem Sterling (right) was outstanding in England's open training session on Tuesday . ‘I’m sure you’ll agree the selection Roy has made is exciting,’ says Rooney. ‘There’s a lot of young players and a lot of pace in the team, which maybe we didn’t have before. ‘Hopefully the young lads will go in with no fear, do what they do for their clubs and if they do that we will have a really strong team and do what we want. Sterling, Jordan Henderson and  Barkley have all been so exciting this season and the way they have kicked on is great to see. ‘If Roy didn’t give them a chance can you imagine the effect it might have had on them? Everyone can feel the excitement around the squad. Cooling down: Rooney sits alongside England captain Steven Gerrard (right) after training . ‘Our aim is to win the tournament — that is what we are preparing for and what we hope is going to happen.’ For something like that to  happen, Rooney really will need to be the main man.","Rooney accepts Brazil 2014 is his final realistic chance to make a major impact at the World Cup .

VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal's quirky training methods . Decision maker: Louis van Gaal has named his Holland 23-man World Cup squad ahead of their Ghana friendly . In: Manchester United striker Robin van Persie (left) has been included by Van Gaal (right) for the World Cup .

PSV Eindhoven goalkeeper Jeroen Zoet and four players from the Dutch Under 21 team - Quincy Promes, Jean-Paul Boetius, Karim Rekik and Tonny Vilhenna - were also dropped. Experienced midfielder Rafael van der Vaart was ruled out on Wednesday after suffering a calf injury during training camp in Portugal.

"While most Brits have been reveling in the last of the Indian summer, it's not looking so bright for high-street retailers. British retailer Next warned today that it will have to lower profit forecasts if unusually warm autumn weather continues and shoppers don't buy winter clothing, denting shares across the sector. Shares in Next, Britain's second biggest clothing retailer by sales, fell as much as 5.6 per cent. Scroll down for video . Warning: Next has warned  that it will have to lower profit forecasts if unusually warm autumn weather continues and shoppers don't buy winter clothing . Shares in Marks & Spencer, the country's largest clothing retailer, declined by up to 4.4 per cent, while department store Debenhams were down by up to 4.7 per cent. The comments had extra resonance coming from Next, which has outperformed rivals for a decade due to a strong online presence, new store openings and diversification into new product areas, such as homewares, as well as new overseas markets. In July the company, whose current poster girl is Kendra Spears, a.k.a. Princess Salwa Aga Khan, raised its guidance for annual sales and profit for the second time in three months. 'Next don't often lower guidance, so the fact that they have said they may do so due to the warmer weather is hitting the shares, which have had a strong run, and will also hit the sector if the weather remains unseasonal,"" said Securequity sales trader Jawaid Afsar. September is on course to be the driest since records began in 1910, according to Britain's Met Office. Next's warning comes less than two weeks after the employee-owned John Lewis, Britain's largest department store chain, became the first major UK retailer to say shoppers were delaying purchases of winter coats, hats and boots because of unseasonably warm and dry weather. Widespread: Shares in Marks & Spencer, the country's largest clothing retailer fronted by supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, declined by up to 4.4 percent . Swedish fashion retailer Hennes & Mauritz, more commonly known as H&M, the world's second biggest fashion retailer, issued a similar statement last week. All in the same boat: Swedish fashion retailer  H&M, the world's second biggest fashion retailer, issued a similar statement last week . M&S said it had no plans to change its trading update schedule. It is next due to update investors on how it is faring on November 5. 'Next are probably being unnecessarily cautious, ahead of investor meetings this week, but the market is unlikely to take any chances and the shares will be unnerved,' said independent retail analyst Nick Bubb. Next, which trades from over 500 stores in Britain and Ireland, about 200 stores overseas, and through its Directory internet and catalogue business, said third quarter sales to date were up 6 percent - lower than its previous forecast of up 10 percent. 'Cooler weather in August resulted in several very strong weeks. However, warmer weather in the more important month of September has had the reverse effect,' it said. Next said that, at present, its profit forecast for the full 2014-15 year remains within its previous guidance range of £775-£815m ($1.26-$1.32 billion), given on July 29 and reiterated on Sept. 11. 'Our experience suggests that some lost sales are regained when the weather turns. However, if this unusually warm weather continues for the full duration of October then we are likely to lower our full year profit guidance range,' it said. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Freddie George added: 'The mild weather...is impacting all retailers in the UK and is only a temporary phenomenon. The underlying trends, in our view, remain positive.' Shares in Next, up 36 percent over the last year, were down 265 pence or 3.8 percent at 6,600 pence at 0905 GMT, valuing the business at around 10 billion pounds.

"Fishing fanatic Jason Ebbett hauled in the biggest yellowfin tuna fish ever recorded in Queensland on his first ever game fishing trip in the state. The gigantic tuna weighed in at 85kg, breaking the previously held Queensland record by 20kg. Mr Ebbett, a Worongary tradesman, had only recently joined the Gold Coast Game Fishing Club so he could target larger fish, and is thrilled to have access to fresh tuna for his meals. He and his crew have eaten over $3000 worth of the fish since their record breaking catch. Gold Coast fishing fanatic Jason Ebbett hauled in the biggest yellowfin tuna fish ever recorded in Queensland on his first ever game fishing trip in the state. Mr Ebbett, a Worongary tradesman had only recently joined the Gold Coast Game Fishing Club so he could target larger fish, and is thrilled to have access to fresh tuna for his meals. 'We are working our way through it pretty quickly,' he told the Gold Coast Bulletin. 'That fish and three others were divided up between about 10 of us.' Mr Ebbett weighs in at 95kg himself, but said it was a struggle to haul the enormous tuna into the boat, and took over 20 minutes to capture fully. 'It was pretty hard going pulling it in,' he said. 'It took three guys to get it in the boat.' The Queensland Game Fishing Association confirmed that the catch made by Mr Ebbett was the largest of the species caught in Queensland's history. 'I only have a 14-foot (4.2 metre) boat, so this is a way of doing another sort of fishing,' he said. 'I have caught a couple of yellowfin tuna before, but nothing close to this size.' Another member of Mr Ebbett's crew, Ashleigh Haigh said that while the Gold Coast was not as known for it's fishing hauls in the same way as other parts of Australia were, he hoped that the massive fish would draw attention to the region. 'There are lots more fish like this out there to be caught,' he said.

"Charged with sexual offences: Dave Lee Travis arrives back at his home in Bedfordshire tonight . Dave Lee Travis vowed to clear his name last night after he was charged with 12 sexual offences, some dating back to the 1970s. The 68-year-old, one of Britain’s best known DJs, said he is ‘very much looking forward’ to proving his innocence. The former Radio 1 and Top Of The Pops presenter is accused of  11 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault over a 30-year period from 1977. The allegations relate to eight women aged between 18 and 29 at the time and a girl of 15. Senior lawyers said no further action would be taken concerning another seven allegations. Travis, who was charged under his real name David Patrick Griffin, will appear before Westminster magistrates next Friday. He has vehemently protested his innocence since his initial arrest nine months ago. Dressed in grey jeans, a white open-neck shirt and a striped jacket, he looked despondent as he returned last night to the £1million Buckinghamshire mansion he shares with his wife Marianne. He said: ‘To say the least I am very disappointed that the police and CPS have decided to bring these charges. These allegations are not true and I think the only other thing I can add to that statement is that I am very much looking forward to actually clearing my name on this and I can’t say more than that.’ Asked what toll it was taking on his family, he added: ‘We’ve had a stressful time, obviously. It’s been quite a long time while all this has been going on and I am looking forward to the day when there is no stress.’ Scroll down for video . Speaking: Travis was the fourth celebrity to be arrested by detectives from Operation Yewtree, which was set up in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal . Will appear in court: The 68-year-old is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault and a count of sexual assault . Travis was charged as part of . Scotland Yard’s Operation Yewtree inquiry, set up in the wake of the . Jimmy Savile scandal to investigate historic claims of sex abuse. One of the indecent assault charges . relates to an 18-year-old woman in 1977; two to a 15-year-old in the . same year and one to a 19-year-old in 1978. Dave Lee Travis, 68, of Bedfordshire, is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on August 23. The charges are: . Prosecutors . have decided that no further action should be taken in relation to . seven separate allegations made against the DJ because there was not . enough evidence. Another said to have occurred  between . 1981 and 1983, involved a woman aged between 26 and 28; one relates to . an 18-year-old in 1983; one to a woman aged 19 or 20 in 1985; one to a . 22-year-old in 1990; and three between 2000 and 2003 to a woman aged 26 . at the time of the first allegation. Travis is also accused of sexually assaulting a 23-year-old in 2007. Alison Saunders, of the Crown . Prosecution Service, said: ‘Having completed our review, we have . concluded that there is sufficient  evidence and it is in the public . interest for Mr Griffin to be charged.’ Travis, whose nicknames include DLT . and The Hairy Cornflake, has denied being a sexual predator and claimed . he was simply a ‘man who loves women’. Shortly after his  initial . arrest, he dismissed the  allegations and said he was  simply accused of . ‘squeezing the boobs of a couple of women’. He said he was appalled to have his name linked to one-time colleague Savile. The charges were welcomed by his alleged victims. Solicitor Jessica Standley, of Slater . and Gordon, which represents several of the women, said: ‘Our clients . are relieved that after this length of time, careful consideration has . been given to the evidence and a decision has been made to prosecute. It . takes a great deal of courage for people to come forward with this kind . of allegation and our clients look forward to having their voices heard . in a court of law.’ The pace of the controversial Yewtree . inquiry shows no sign of slowing. On Monday an unnamed 80-year-old man . linked to Savile was arrested in South London on suspicion of sexual . assault. Travis is due to appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court on August 23 charged with 12 sexual offences . On the same day, former Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning, who was originally arrested in June, had his bail renewed until October. Last week veteran entertainer Rolf . Harris, 83, was arrested for a second time. Two other suspects, comedian .

"All professional players in English football will be banned from betting on any matches anywhere in the world from next season. The ruling, which was first revealed by Sportsmail's Charles Sale in February, was ratified at the Football Association's AGM on Wednesday and will apply to any player in the top eight tiers of the English league system, Press Association Sport understands. It replaces the current rules which only banned players from betting on competitions in which their club was involved. Ban: Pro footballers playing in England will not be allowed to bet on any matches anywhere in the world . Tottenham winger Andros Townsend, Newcastle's Dan Gosling - who is to join Bournemouth next season - and Cameron Jerome, who played on loan at Crystal Palace from Stoke last season, are among those to have been found to have breached current betting regulations. Players will also be prohibited from passing on inside information to a third party who uses that information for betting. The FA confirmed the ban would start from August 1 and also cover betting on new managers or player transfers. It said in a statement: 'A worldwide ban on betting on football will come into force from 1 August 2014 for certain participants in English football. Breach: Dan Gosling was found found to have breached current rules on betting . 'Participants covered by the ban will be prohibited from betting, either directly or indirectly, on any football match or competition that takes place anywhere in the world.

The 27-year-old model told The Sun's Hayley Coyle: 'The sex ban is so hard for me - but Carl tells me he isn't that bothered because he's exhausted and it's the last thing on his mind. 'After such a long wait it's really good to have our sex life back to normal and to have that closeness again, to be able to have sex like a normal young couple. Training hard: Froch (left) has been sparring hard to ensure he does not make same mistakes against Groves . 'I seem to get pregnant straight after a sex ban, maybe because it's been so long. Then I have the baby to coincide with the next fight.' Having been with Froch since 2008, Rachael has had to forgo sex on numerous occasions - but that hasn't made it any easier for her . In the build-up to the Cobra's rematch with George Groves, Froch has dedicated himself to his training. He struggled early-on in the first fight against Groves in November after being floored in the first round and only won via a controversial stoppage by the referee in the ninth. That result forced a rematch to be ordered by the IBF, leading to this Saturday's bout at Wembley. Froch, 36, is determined not to repeat his mistakes of last time and has been sleeping in a separate annexe in his £1million Nottingham home since February and leaving Rachael all alone in their room. But come Saturday, Rachael will be cheering her man on at ringside in anticipation of their long-awaited reunion after.

"Everton are discussing a potential £150,000 deal for Shelbourne’s young right-back Ryan Robinson. The 18-year-old is tipped to follow in the footsteps of Seamus Coleman who Everton signed for a bargain £60,000 from Sligo Rovers in 2009 and is now rated in the £20million bracket. Robinson has already spent time on trial at Everton’s Finch Farm training ground and Shelbourne boss Johnny McDonnell said: ‘Ryan certainly has a big future in the game. Wanted man: Everton are keen on signing Shelbourne right-back Ryan Robinson (pictured in the orange) On the hunt: Robinson has been billed as the next Seamus Coleman, who shone for the Toffees last season . ‘Everton would have seen a rawness to him but he has a lot going for him. ‘We’d have no problem allowing him to move on to a better level in England. Everton are chipping away with us on Ryan at the moment and we hope to get the deal over the line soon. ‘The initial fee won’t make us millionaires but we’ll make sure it’s heavy on the end of it.

"Kevin Pietersen has labelled Paul Downton's accusation that the batsman was not interested during the Ashes Down Under as 'untrue'. Downton, the new managing director of the ECB, told BBC's Test Match Special that he had never seen any player 'as disinterested or distracted on a cricket field' as Pietersen was during the disastrous winter series and said he could not find 'one supporter' of the batsman among the staff. However, the 33-year-old, who was sacked by England earlier this year, retorted on his website: 'The suggestion that I was uninterested during the winter Ashes series against Australia is wholly untrue. Hitting back: Kevin Pietersen rejected Paul Downton's claims made on Test Match Special . Hitting out: Pietersen was criticised for his 'irresponsible' batting style during the Ashes series in Australia . 'Although I was having injections in my knee, which inhibited my mobility and thus my ability to field close to the wicket, I was fully motivated to play for England and whilst I accept that the series as a whole fell well below my own personal standards, I finished the series as the top scorer. 'I did, and continue to have a good relationship with most of the England players, which has been subsequently highlighted by a number of press interviews'. Tough talking: ECB managing director Paul Downton (left) and BBC Test Match Special commentator Jonathan Agnew (right) Outcast: New England coach Peter Moores could not find any support among senior players for Pietersen . Downton also attacked Pietersen's batting style, which he called 'frustrating' and implied was irresponsible. To that, Pietersen responded: 'With regard to the criticisms aimed at my “The way I play type attitude”, I feel it’s only reasonable to remind Mr Downton that this method has brought me over 13,500 runs for England, in addition to being part of four Ashes-winning teams and a World T20-winning side, all of which achievements I am hugely proud of.' Pietersen says this statement does not breach his confidentiality agreement as he had a right to reply. Whilst I have always abided by the confidentiality clauses that the ECB were insistent on imposing in the settlement agreement I entered into with them at the time of the termination of my central contract, I feel it only fair to exercise my right to reply to the comments made by Paul Downton in an interview that took place on Test Match Special during yesterday’s One Day International. Aside from the strange timing of yesterday’s interview during an ODI, the comments regarding the cancellation of my contract should be put in perspective. It was made very clear to me that I was not being selected for the World T20 squad, and the ECB did not try to give me the remotest confidence that I would be seriously considered for selection for England again. Had I allowed my contract to “wind down”, as the ECB proposed, I would not only have forfeited the performance-related elements that are part of the England player remuneration, but more importantly my availability as a professional cricketer would have remained under the control of the ECB for a further eight months. The suggestion that I was uninterested during the winter Ashes series against Australia is wholly untrue. Although I was having injections in my knee, which inhibited my mobility and thus my ability to field close to the wicket, I was fully motivated to play for England and whilst I accept that the series as a whole fell well below my own personal standards, I finished the series as the top scorer. I did, and continue to have a good relationship with most of the England players, which has been subsequently highlighted by a number of press interviews.

"Diego Simeone was on the verge of making history with Atletico Madrid before he and his side imploded to bitter local rivals Real in the Champions League final. Simeone ran on to the pitch twice, either side of extra time, to confront referee Bjorn Kuipers and Raphael Varane as Atletico lost 4-1 at Benfica's Stadium of Light. The La Liga champions looked like they were on course to win a maiden European crown when defender Diego Godin headed them in front before half-time.

Brawl: Simeone (second left) squared up to Raphael Varane (right) after Real scored their fourth goal . However, Atletico's dreams were dashed when Sergio Ramos equalised late in second-half stoppage time. Ramos' goal was much to the chargrin of Simeone, who ran on to the pitch at the . end of the first-half of extra time to vent his annoyance at referee Kuipers. The Argentinian was incensed by the five minutes of added time that the Dutchman allowed for Carlo Ancelotti's side to score in. Simeone's frustrations grew as late goals from Gareth Bale, Marcelo and a Cristiano Ronaldo penalty gave Real victory. Simeone, who is notorious for having a . short fuse, lived up to his reputation as he stormed on to the pitch in . a heated exchange with Varane after Ronaldo's goal.

After the match, Simeone explained that he was upset with the 21-year-old for celebrating in front of the Atleti bench, hence his furious reaction. 'He's a great player and he has a great life ahead of him,' Simeone said. 'But it was just ugly.

"A mother living in the heart of ISIS-controlled territory has described the terror she and her eight-year-old son face every single day as militants tighten their savage grip on power. The woman, who has not been named for fear of reprisals, lives in the ISIS-controlled Iraqi city of Mosul, where there have been reports of torture and beheadings for anyone who falls foul of the terrorists. Her own husband was murdered and she fears her son could face a similar fate. She has been keeping her son out of school as she fears he could be brainwashed and see horrifying scenes as he walks to school. Radicals: ISIS supporters  carry the group's flags in front of the provincial government headquarters in Mosul, Iraq. A mother living there has described the pall of fear that hangs over the city . 'I'd prefer to keep him at home, I never let him out. I'm really scared for him. I want to prevent him from seeing horrible things on the street,' she said. 'There are lots of horrible things going on and children see them. They see weapons, armoured cars and the militants in black uniforms. It's very scary for them.' The mother, speaking to the BBC World Service, also faces the prospect of her son becoming brainwashed by the militants - even though they killed the boy's father. Brutal: Human rights lawyer Samira Salih al-Nuaimi (pictured) was publicly executed in the Iraqi city of Mosul after she criticised ISIS on Facebook . She added: 'We don't know who killed him but it was Islamic militants and the reason I'm so scared for my son is because he keep saying: ""these are the people who killed my dad"". 'These people are ruthless, they would do horrible things to him.' As well as the oppressive rule by ISIS, the unnamed mother spoke of power outages and food shortages in Mosul. She added: 'There's no future. Last week ISIS terrorists publicly executed a human rights lawyer in Mosul after she criticised the group on Facebook for destroying religious monuments. Samira Salih al-Nuaimi was seized from her home on September 17 shortly after she allegedly posted messages on Facebook that were critical of the militants' destruction of religious sites in the city. According to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq, al-Nuaimi was tried in a Sharia law court for apostasy, before being tortured for five days and eventually being sentenced to public execution. News of al-Nuaimi's shocking death emerged after a coalition of American, French and Arab forces carried out a third night of deadly airstrikes against ISIS targets which have already killed scores of militants. On Friday Britain launched its first combat mission against Islamic State – as the RAF launched two waves of attack against the deadly terrorists. Two heavily-armed jets flew from a top-security RAF base in Cyprus on the dangerous sortie over IS-held territory in Northern Iraq, before returning safely to complete her 2,000-mile round trip.

"One of the largest gold nuggets in modern times pulled from Northern California's Gold Country has sold to a secret buyer. The new owner of the so-called Butte Nugget and its exact price will both remain mysteries at the buyer's request, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Saturday. But Don Kagin, the Tiburon-based coin dealer who brokered the deal, said that a 'prominent Bay Area collector' paid about $400,000 for the nugget weighing 6.07 pounds (2.8 kilograms). That wasn't far off from the asking price, he said. Sold: The Butte Nugget, one of the biggest gold nuggets found in modern times in Northern California's historic Gold Country was sold to a secret buyer for about $400,000 . 'Let's just say it's a win-win for everybody, Kagin said, adding that the nugget went up for sale Thursday with the deal finalized on Friday. Historically, prospectors found giant gold nuggets in California during the 19th century Gold Rush days, including a 54-pound chunk found in Butte County in 1859. It has been decades since a report of anyone discovering a rock of 6 pounds or more in California. The gold hunter who found the nugget found it in July in the mountains of Butte County. He also asked Kagin to keep his name and the location of the discovery a secret. Secret: The buyer asked that Kagin keep his identity and the location of the discovery a secret . Frenzy: Reports of the nugget's pending sale caused a near frenzy among gold and history buffs, with the newspaper reporting one bidder inquiring from Australia .

"Anthony Joshua has his sights raised towards winning a world heavyweight title as early as next year but he remains heart-warmingly in touch with the more humble amateur environment which turned him from a street chump into an Olympic champ. Big Josh turned professional a year after striking gold at the London Games. Yet he still makes the trek north from Watford to the English Sports Institute in Sheffield where several of his former GB team-mates continue to work under national coach Rob McCracken. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Anthony Joshua spar with Joe Joyce . On the button: Anthony Joshua (left) in action against Hector Avila as he maintained his unbeaten record . The other day he came into close contact of a very personal kind with both levels of his fighting life. Joshua found himself not only helping Britain’s leading amateur boxers get ready for this summer’s Commonwealth Games in Glasgow but also sitting in on Carl Froch’s gruelling  preparations for his mega-rematch with George Groves. McCracken, who trains both Team GB and the Nottingham Cobra, cleverly links those amateur and professional experiences to the benefit of both parties. Joshua never forgets how the uplifting atmosphere which McCracken created in the build-up to the 2012 Olympics helped him turn away from the drug-strewn temptations of gang-land. He has talked eloquently and often about how boxing enabled him to transform his life but his actions speak even louder than those words. There has not been so much as a hint of a relapse since his solitary cannabis conviction four years ago. Furthermore, but he is already giving back to the sport which rescued him. Joshua journeyed to Sheffield to spar with his likeliest successor in the GB team, the new ABA champion Joe Joyce. ‘If I can be of help I’m only too pleased,’ said Joshua. ‘But it’s no hardship for me. I loved my time with the amateurs. I love coming back to see the guys and working with them. I only wish I could do it more often.’ A sense of belonging with this amateur family made Joshua hesitate about turning pro for a full year after his Olympic triumph and he was strongly tempted to go on to Rio 2016. Now the aura of nostalgia draws him back and the lads in vests are thrilled to see him. Machine: Joshua has stopped each of his five opponents since turning professional last year . Dangerous: Joshua has adapted to live in the paid ranks with ease having won Olympic gold as an amateur . Next up: Joshua takes on Matt Legg (left) on the undercard of Carl Froch's rematch with George Groves . Joshua’s . arrival galvanises the camp, as does Froch’s regular presence during . training for his big world super-middleweight title fights. These two are glittering examples of what the future may hold for a dedicated and successful amateur. For Big Josh, the chance to talk professionally with Froch is a bonus. Joshua faces Matt Legg on the undercard of Froch-Groves II and he is thrilled to be appearing in front of an unprecedented 80,000 crowd at Wembley Stadium. ‘I can’t wait,’ he says. ‘So excited. This will be a huge night in my life. Imagine the atmosphere.’ Joshua believes this exposure to the big-time will help accelerate his ascent to the world heavyweight title. It is only seven months since the first of his five paid victories but he says: ‘I’m already thinking about challenging Wladimir Klitschko in 2015.’ That may require him to take up the offer of a big British battle with Tyson Fury en route, assuming Manchester’s giant traveller beats Dereck Chisora in their summer rematch. But Froch does nothing to dampen the enthusiasm. He tells Joshua: You’re doing great. Boxing is a short career but it can earn a long living. You must stay focused and totally dedicated. That does mean making sacrifices now. But it’s only for a few years and it’s worth it.’ Froch, as he goes into his 12th consecutive world title fight, is living proof of that – as well as an inspiration to the young men who are the long-term future of the British ring. Unstoppable? Wladimir Klitschko (right) stopped Alex Leapai to retain his heavyweight world titles . Challenge: Joshua believes he will be ready to take on world champion Klitschko next year . KHAN REWARDED FOR COLLAZO WIN . Amir Khan’s gamble that he would excite the wide world of boxing with his appearance on Floyd Mayweather’s latest under-card in Las Vegas has reaped its first reward. The WBC have promoted him to the position of No 1 challenger to Floyd Mayweather for their world welterweight title. This does not mean he gets the next shot at the best pound-for-pound boxer on the planet, even though the WBC were clearly impressed by his 12-round, three knock-down demolition of respected former world champion Luis Collazo. But in holding back from enforcing the young man from Bolton as the mandatory contender that organisation is respecting Khan’s Muslim obligation to observe Ramadan, which renders him unavailable for Mayweather’s next outing in September. Reward: Amir Khan (left) is now ranked No 1 with the WBC after his win over Luis Collazo . Demolition: Khan looked impressive as he dismantled Collazo in Las Vegas earlier this month . The odds are – assuming that Mayweather beats whoever he chooses to face in that fight and Khan wins an interim contest of his own in late October or early November – that the WBC will  call for them to face each other next May. Prior to his fight for redemption little more than a fortnight ago, there was much scoffing at the conviction held by some, myself included, that Khan has specific assets which could cause  Mayweather serious problems. Now, after seeing Khan dazzle and his former victim Marcos Maidana give Mayweather a tough time, the belief is growing that King Khan’s  lightning speed might trouble a  slightly slowing Money man. What a difference a night makes. COULD MAYWEATHER AND PACQUIAO FINALLY COLLIDE? The man who calls himself Money may yet be coerced into the fight the world wants to see above all others by finance, of all things. A fall in pay-per-view ratings in America is being blamed in some quarters there on the failure of Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao to get into the ring with each other. Signs of declining public interest in these, the two greatest pound-for-pound fighters in the world today, going through the formality of beating other opponents are detected in television box office returns projected at less than a million for their most recent fights. Drop: Floyd Mayweather's fight with Marcos Maidana is expected to have seen a drop in pay-per-view revenue . Unbeaten: Mayweather ws given a torrid time by Maidana before preserving his perfect record . Pacquiao’s promoter Bob Arum has admitted to no more than 650,000 subscribers for the HBO telecast of his man’s revenge win over Tim Bradley last month. Meanwhile, more than two weeks after the event, the Showtime network have still not released figures for Money Mayweather’s win over Marcos Maidana. The boxing grapevine is a-rustle with whispers of 850,000 buys, which would fall short of their minimum pre-fight prediction of one million. What is certain is that there will be a huge drop from the 2.2million sales for Mayweather’s preceding fight with Canelo Alvarez, which stands second in the all-time pay-per-view ratings to Mr Money’s historic battle with Oscar De La Hoya which drew 2.4m. Mayweather was guaranteed at least US $32million for this fight and should still bank more than $40m. But the Forbes Rich List in America is flatly discounting his boast of a $70 million pay-night.If he cannot improve the numbers for his next fight in September – which may or may not be a re-match with Maidana once the true income from their first fight is taken into account  – he may struggle to reach the $300 million estimate for his six-fight contract with Showtime. Three of those spectaculars are yet to come. Take that: Manny Pacquiao earned his revenge over Timothy Bradley with victory in their rematch last month . Will it happen? Pacquiao has so far failed to agree terms with Mayweather for a mega fight . Pacquiao, meanwhile, is heading for a fifth fight in his series with Juan Manuel Marquez in the autumn following the Mexican’s predictable win over Mike Alvarado at the weekend. That would test the public’s appetite for repetitive contests. Still, Mayweather finds reasons for not fighting Pacquiao. First the PacMan consented to Olympic standard random blood testing. Then he agreed to take less than 50 per cent of the money. Now Mayweather is insisting that Pacquiao dumps Arum, which frankly is none of his business even though he walked out on the Hall of Fame promoter at the height of a bitter dispute some years ago. But when it comes to Money, money talks. Unless the returns pick up, Showtime may well insist that he fights Pacquiao during the course of their current contract. Nor is it any secret that in Mayweather’s hands money evaporates like water in the Nevada desert. Still going strong: Juan Manuel Marquez (left) comfortably outpointed Mike Alvarado at the weekend . Let's do it again: Marquez could now face Pacquaio in the autumn in the fifth leg of their rival . Although his career earnings are reported close to $400 million, his current net worth is put at $216 million. The high-end gambling in his home town of Las Vegas, the extravagant spending on such luxury goods as Rolls, Bentleys and diamond-encrusted watches, the expanding entourage and the separations from the mothers of his children can quickly mount up. Then there are the run-ins with the Inland Revenue and it may be that the only resolution to the tax man will be to call the PacMan. Perhaps Mr Money will rake in another $300 million before he’s done. But then so did Iron Mike Tyson...","Anthony Joshua is confident he will be ready for a world title shot next year .

"Steve Bruce admitted he was physically and mentally exhausted and in need of a holiday — but it may have to be a short one. The exertions of keeping Hull City in the Barclays Premier League and negotiating a route to the FA Cup final took a heavy toll on the former Manchester United centre back, who looked as if he had thrown himself into every header and tackle on Saturday. It was an energy-sapping end to an afternoon which started high on promise but ultimately just failed to deliver. How close Bruce’s side came, though, thanks to the manager’s canny tactical approach in the face of so many obstacles. Dejected: Steve Bruce says there is no consolation in having contributed to a fantastic final . Salute: Bruce acknowledges the fans, who gave him, and Hull, superb backing during, and after, the final . Beating relegation has already enhanced Bruce’s reputation this season, to the extent that most neutrals would have been rooting for his team at Wembley. Pushing Arsenal all the way —despite missing Nikica Jelavic and Shane Long, both cup-tied — added another impressive bullet point to his managerial c.v. In the end, Hull surrendered an early 2-0 lead. They now face a fixture schedule that allows little scope for recharging batteries and will be a further test of Bruce’s management skills. After succumbing to Aaron Ramsey’s extra-time winner, Hull will now enter next season’s Europa League at the third qualifying round stage on either July 29 or 30. It sent a shudder through Bruce, who will start an urgent summer recruitment drive by trying to turn Tottenham midfielder Jake Livermore’s loan move into a permanent deal for around £7million. ‘We’ve got European football now, and we are going to have to try and enjoy it,’ he said with a wry chuckle. ‘Whether we’ve got the resources and bank power, I ain’t so sure. ‘There are all sorts of rules, and we’ve only got 21 players to pick from at the moment. We’ve got a game in July, and we will have played four times by the end of August, and I’m not sure we’re quite ready for that. Target: Jake Livermore, who has been on loan from Tottenham, is a player Bruce would like again next year . Watching on: Bruce (right) can only watch as Arsenal start to celebrate at the final whistle . Break time: The Hull boss says he needs to take a break from football before planning for next season . Hull will enter the Europa League in the third qualifying round on July 31 along with European giants Lyon and PSV Eindhoven. Their tie is unlikely to be glamorous though — they are likely to face the likes of JK Sillamae Kalev from Estonia, FC Shirak from Armenia or Sioni Bolnisi from Georgia. Tottenham, who finished sixth in the Premier League, join a round a later for the play-offs while Everton join the competition in the group stages. As for lucky Manchester United, they can enjoy Thursday nights free of the Europa League.  Mr Van Gaal will be pleased. ‘I’m completely gone, and need to get away, so I will tackle all that when I get back. But we have to make sure this isn’t the end of the story, after all we’ve done and all we put into this final, and that is the challenge for us now. ‘How many players do we need? Certainly five or six. We landed two or three really big ones, like Tom Huddlestone and Jake Livermore — who we hope to secure as our player now after having him on loan. 'But it’s an ongoing process, and there are out-of-contract players to sort out as well. There’s a lot to be done to make sure we are ready to go again, but I need a break first. I’m absolutely b****cksed!’ It is a quick turnaround for Bruce, and other clubs’ retained lists may prove required poolside reading at his holiday retreat, but his players are convinced he will come up with all the answers. Their faith in him is unshakeable. ‘People go on about second- season syndrome in the Premier League, but the gaffer will make sure we don’t suffer from that,’ said defender James Chester. ‘That’s what he’s paid for, and he has done really well in the last two transfer windows. Faith: Chester (left), who gave Hull the lead at Wembley, trusts Bruce to get it right again next season . Perfect start: Bruce celebrates going in front at Wembley, but Hull were unable to hang on against Arsenal . ‘He signed players who kept us up, and what we have achieved has to act as a springboard. There can be no going backwards, but there won’t be. 'The gaffer won’t allow it.We all expect to see a few new faces when we return, and that’s just what we need to cope with the extra demands next season. It is going to give everyone a lift. ‘Getting something sorted out with Jake would be a good start. He’s been massive for us. I’d not seen a lot of him before, but once he came here, he hit it off straightaway. Hopefully there’s a deal to be done there.’ There is an uncomplicated bluntness about Bruce that brings the best out of players who might not be automatic choices at other Premier League clubs. They know where they stand and what is expected, and it shone through again, as he looked back on one of the most dramatic and enthralling finals of recent times. He could have taken comfort from his unfancied side running Arsenal so close and playing a full part in a two-hour classic that was compelling viewing even as late as the 116th minute, when substitute Sone Aluko reached the ball a split-second before Arsenal keeper Lukasz Fabianski on the left touchline but steered his angled shot agonisingly wide of a gaping goal. In the final analysis, though, they fell short, and that was all that  mattered. P*** all: Bruce says the medal he received from Prince William for coming second is meaningless . Being able to hold heads high didn’t come close to atoning for not being able to lift the first trophy of his managerial career. Asked if there might be a cup with his name on it one day, Bruce replied: ‘I thought it might have been this one. I couldn’t have asked more of my players, and it looked like we might do it. It has taken me 16 years to get to this stage, but it wasn’t to be. ‘To me, it’s no consolation that we have contributed so much to a final that will live long in the memory. None whatsoever. 'It doesn’t make it any better or easier to accept. There is no satisfaction in coming so close. It means p***-all. A loser’s medal doesn’t sit well with me.’","Steve Bruce says runners up medal 'means p*** all'

"A Chinese woman  spent an entire week in a KFC eating fried chicken wings after being dumped by her boyfriend because she ‘needed time to think’. Lovesick Tan Shen, 26, from Chengdu, in China’s southwest Sichuan Province, went to the fast food chain in search of some comfort food to get over the break-up. But seven days later Tan was still ordering chicken wings with a side of extra large fries at the KFC near a train station by her home. Lovesick Tan Shen, 26, went to the fast food chain in search of some comfort food to get over the break-up . She even phoned in sick to work to stay at the restaurant. Tan said: ‘I was walking around feeling miserable and decided to stop off at the KFC at the train station. 'I hadn’t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings. 'But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think. 'I didn’t want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.' After a few days employees at the chicken shop began to worry about Tan. For seven days Tan ordered chicken wings with  extra large fries at the KFC near a train station by her home . Tan said she stayed at the fast food restaurant for so long because she 'needed time to think' Worker Jiang Li Lung, 22, said: 'We work in shifts here and the restaurant is open 24 hours a day, so we get a lot of people coming through. 'At first no one really noticed her. 'But after a few days I began thinking she looked really familiar. 'Then I realised we had been serving her for the past three days and that she hadn’t actually left. 'When we asked her if she was ok, she said she was and just needed time to think. 'And then asked for another box of chicken wings with extra large fries.' Tan even called in sick to her work so she could spent time at the KFC recovering from her break-up . He said the Tan was doing no harm eating her way through boxes of chicken so they let her stay. He added: 'She was after all a paying customer, even if a bit of an odd one.' Tan decided she had had enough when local media turned up after a week at the KFC. And, unsurprisingly, she was starting to get sick of the taste of chicken. 'I decided the best thing to do would be to leave the city and go back to my parents. It was only after a week that Tan decided she was 'sick of the taste of chicken' and she went home . 'I had already told work I was off sick, so phoned them and said I was leaving. 'And I was getting sick of the taste of chicken so there was no point in staying there anymore.' She then boarded the next train to her parents' home in Quingdao city in east China’s Shandong Province and left. Waitress Jiang Li Lung said: 'I guess we kind of miss her.

"Police tried to smash a car window to rescue a young Queensland girl who was accidentally locked in the vehicle by her mother on Thursday. Authorities were called to the Aldi car park in Gympie, north of Brisbane, after the distressed two-year-old started to overheat. This comes as state roadside assistance bodies around Australia have revealed they are called to save thousands of children from locked cars each year, issuing a warning to parents and passersby to be extra vigilant as we enter the warmer months. Authorities were called to the Aldi car park in Gympie, north of Brisbane, after a distressed two-year-old was locked in her mother's car . On Thursday Gympie police officer Steve Buchanan tried but could not smash his way into the vehicle with his baton while waiting for roadside assistance from the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland (RACQ) to unlock the car, The Gympie Times reported. He chipped and scratched the car but was unable to get in to the Mazda 3 hatch. After a number of minutes the RACQ arrived and were able to unlock the rear passenger door. The toddler, who was unharmed, jumped into her relieved mother's arms. The RACQ said improved safety features and remote locking technology led to about 100 incidences per month of children needing to be rescued from locked in cars in Queensland alone. A spokeswoman told the Times that cars could reach 40 degree temperatures within seven minutes, even in winter. 'Being exposed to such high temperatures in a car can kill or lead to severe injury for young children in a relatively short time,' she said. Peter Khoury, spokesman for NRMA in NSW, said they had rescued 2179 children from locked cars in the past year. 'It becomes more alarming as we come into the summer months,' Mr Khoury said. 'In summer it doesn't take very long at all for the temperature to reach as high as 80 degrees – that's almost cooking temperatures. 'It's not long at all for a child to become disoriented, agitated and then dehydrated and suffering organ failure.' Mr Khoury said people should call police or their local roadside assistance body immediately if they saw a child locked in a car. 'If they consider the child to be in danger, break the car window, don't wait,' he said. He also warned that is was illegal to leave a child unattended in a car, with the penalty carrying fines of up to $22,000. The RACV in Victoria was called to 1500 cases of children locked in cars in the year leading up to July. Victorian parliament recently discussed raising the penatly for leaving a child unattended in a car from fines of $2214 to $3690 and prison terms from one and a half months to three months.","Authorities called to Aldi car park in Gympie, to rescue two-year-old girl .

"A 23-year-old man has died after getting into difficulty during a swim while ‘under the influence of alcohol’ at a popular surf spot. The man, who has not yet been formally identified but who is believed to be from Cornwall, died after getting into trouble off Towan Beach in Newquay in the early hours of this morning. Police and coastguard crews launched a major search for the swimmer after he was reported missing in the water by a friend at about 2.45am. The 23-year-old man, who has not yet been formally identified, died after getting into difficulty while swimming off Towan Beach in Newquay (pictured) while 'under the influence of alcohol' in the early hours of this morning . He was found in a 'serious condition' by emergency crews off a neighbouring beach and flown to the Royal Cornwall Hospital (Treliske) in Truro in a search and rescue helicopter from RNAS Culdrose. However, he later passed away from his injuries. Police said his next of kin had been informed. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the search operation was launched after a 999 call reported a man ‘under the influence’ in the water. A spokesman said: ‘At 2.43am the coastguard received a 999 call from a lady on a Newquay beach reporting that her boyfriend and a friend had gone swimming in the sea while under the influence of alcohol and only one of them had returned. ‘The missing swimmer was located in the surf line by the Newquay inshore lifeboat. ‘The ambulance crew attended to the casualty before being airlifted to Treliske Hospital where he was later declared deceased.’ The agency said the search and rescue helicopter from RNAS Culdrose was joined by coastguard crews from Newquay and Padstow and police officers in looking for the man. A Devon and Cornwall spokesman said: ‘Just before 3am police, ambulance and the coastguard responded to a report of concern for a swimmer at Towan Beach, Newquay. The swimmer was flown to Royal Cornwall Hospital (Treliske) in Truro (pictured) but later passed away . ‘After conducting a search of the water and beaches in the area, a man was found in the water near Great Western beach. ‘The man was taken to Treliske Hospital via the search and rescue helicopter where sadly he later died. ‘The deceased is thought to be a 23-year-old man from Cornwall.

"Honda has showcased a new  system that can read road signs and spot pedestrians to lessen the chance of collisions – and it is set to be rolled out by the end of this year. The Japanese company’s ‘Sensing’ technology offers a collection of driving aids to make journeys safer and easier for drivers. They work using a ‘millimetre-wave radar’ which is fitted to a car’s radiator grille and a monocular camera mounted near the car’s rear-view mirror. Honda has revealed a driver-assistive system that can read road signs and spot pedestrians to lessen the chance of collisions – and it's set to be rolled out by the end of this year. It uses a ‘millimetre-wave radar’ which is fitted to a car’s radiator grille and a monocular camera mounted near the car’s rear-view mirror (illustrated) More than 1.2 million people are killed in car crashes around the world every year, but auto manufacturers are developing increasingly smart cars with a host of new safety features that give vehicles a mind of their own. Honda's radar can spot obstacles in the road, such as pedestrians, oncoming vehicles, or cars directly in front, while the camera captures information such as the object’s size, speed and distance from the front of the car. When there is a risk of collision with a vehicleor a pedestrian, the system can provide the driver with audio and visual warnings. The radar spots obstacles in the road, such as pedestrians, oncoming vehicles, or cars directly in front, while the camera captures information such as the object’s size, speed and distance from the front of the car. The system can warn the driver of an obstacle and brake if needed, as shown in this diagram . If a pedestrian or obstacle is too close, the Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS) automatically applies gentle brake pressure to warn the driver. If they don’t respond, the system automatically brakes to avoid an obstacle and a driver can steer the while to activate a 'collision avoidance effort' (pictured) If the distance gets closer, the Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS) will automatically apply gentle brake pressure to warn the driver. If they don’t respond, the system will automatically brake hard to avoid an obstacle. Developing a system that can detect pedestrians has been a challenge for many car manufacturers because they do not reflect radio waves well and can move unpredictably or quickly. But the camera used in the new system can spot them within 196ft (60 metres) ahead of the vehicle. The system itself recognises the car’s surroundings and the intentions of the driver, the company says. For example, the Road Departure Mitigation (RDM) system keeps a car in its lane. The camera detects the lane boundaries and if the car looks like it will stray from a detected line, the steering wheel will vibrate to warn the driver. The bundle of sensing technology also uses the camera to read traffic signs (illustrated) to show them on the dashboard display, or a heads-up display projected onto the windscreen, making it easier for drivers to notice a change in the speed limit . It will also correct steering, if necessary, to pull the car back into lane. If it predicts that a vehicle could leave the road – if a driver has fallen asleep at the wheel, for example – it will brake. The bundle of sensing technology also uses the camera to read traffic signs to show them on the dashboard display, or a heads-up display projected onto the windscreen, making it easier for drivers to notice a change in the speed limit. Honda’s sensing technology will be embedded in its Legend – a luxury car that will become available in Japan towards the end of this year. The model is known as the Acura RLX in the US. The technology will be rolled out to other cars in Japan, before being embedded in US vehicles. It is expected to bridge the gap between today’s minimal driver assist technology and autonomous vehicles of the future. The Lane assist system is shown, which warns drivers about their position and helps them stay in lane if they are about to leave the road . Collision Mitigation Braking System: The radar and camera can detect oncoming vehicles and pedestrians. If there is a risk of a collision, the system warns the driver and if they don’t respond, it brakes hard. Road Departure Mitigation system: The camera detects lane boundaries and if a car drives outside them, a warning is shown on the display and the steering wheel vibrates. It will correct steering is necessary and brake to stop a car coming off the road. Pedestrian Collision Mitigation Steering System: The system detects pedestrians and a boundary line on the side of the road. It can predict a crash if the car strays from the road and will steer the car away from the person if necessary. Lane Keeping Assist System: The system will assist the driver’s steering during highway driving to keep the vehicle in the middle of the lane using a vibrating steering wheel. Adaptive Cruise Control: The system can detect the distance and speed gap from a vehicle ahead, controlling the acceleration and braking so an appropriate distance is maintained. Traffic Sign Recognition: The camera detects traffic signs and they are shown on the display or a heads-up display on the windscreen. False Start Prevention Function: The radar can spot a vehicle in front of a car that’s stopped or is driving at a low speed. The system stops sudden accidental acceleration to prevent crashes. Lead Car Departure Notification System: The radar can detect when a car in front stops in traffic, giving the driver a visual and audio warning to prepare to brake.","Honda's system is set to be rolled out by the end of this year in Japan .

"This mock-up image shows a number plate on a bike which Katy Bourne says will make it easier to prosecute cyclists for breaking the law . A police chief has called for cyclists to be forced to wear number plates so they can be prosecuted more easily if they break the law. Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne said cyclists should have the same identification as drivers so they can be penalised in the same way if they go through traffic lights. Mrs Bourne, who argued a few individuals 'ruin it for the many', said equal punishment for drivers and cyclists would 'make life easier'. Speaking at a public meeting, she said: 'I would like to see cyclists wear some form of identification like cars have. 'This way when they go through traffic lights, you can actually identify them and then you can prosecute them for breaking the law.' But Tony Green, of the Brighton and Hove Cycling Campaign, blasted the idea as 'totally unrealistic' for administrative and practical reasons. Mr Green, 67, from Brighton, East Sussex, said: 'Cyclists are seen as the easy target. 'I don't really know what it is, but maybe people think they are getting something for free.' Mrs Bourne, who added the idea was 'one for the legislators', said: 'It is something that has been at the back of my mind for a long time. 'Because when you use the road, if you are driving a car you have your number plate [to identify you]. 'Other people register, they pay to use the roads and cyclists don't, admittedly, but there have been occasions when I have been sat at red lights and seen cyclists go through. 'And it is never the responsible cyclists that do this. 'The ones that belong to the clubs, they are great, they are the ones that adhere to all the laws, so it is the few that ruin it for the many.' Mr Green argued car drivers do not pay to use the road, despite common belief. He said car tax (vehicle excise duty) goes into the central coffers, not the roads and road tax, which was abolished in 1937. Mr Green added: 'I agree there are cyclists who break the law but then ten or one hundred times as many motorists break the law.' Could this be the future?

"David Hayes, 79, has been left with three metal spikes sticking out of his gums for a decade . A pensioner has been left with three metal spikes sticking out of his gums for more than a decade, as dentists argue over who should treat him. David Heys from Bradley, had an operation to install special implants in his gums to fix his dentures in place. But the work, which was carried out in the late 1990s, is now causing the 79-year-old severe problems, leaving him unable to eat solid food. Mr Heys claims he has been dismissed at every turn in his quest to seek help, being referred from one specialist to another. His dentist, Gencare in Huddersfield said it does not have the expertise to solve the problem. But after waiting months for an appointment at specialist hospital, the Leeds Dental Institute, Mr Heys said he was told to go back to his normal surgery. No sooner than he did that was he referred back to the Leeds hospital again. The 79-year-old said he believes his was an emergency case, because he was starting to suffer other health problems as a result of his inability to eat. A letter from a dentist at Gencare to Leeds Dental Institute, said: 'It is beyond my ability to provide Mr Heys with a suitable new implant retained denture. 'Thus, I am referring him for diagnosis and treatment as you see appropriate.' Mr Heys said it is now more than two years since he began asking dentists for help. Scroll down for video . He said he feels let down by the Leeds hospital after waiting months for a consultation in September. 'They haven't done the job they should have done,' he said. 'They've done two repairs which lasted only a few days and now they're not prepared to see me for another six months. 'I feel very neglected. I have paid into the system all my life. 'If the hospital can't do it how can they expect a local dentist to do it?' He claims he has been dismissed by every part of the health service, being referred from one specialist to another. He says the three spikes can hurt his tongue and leave him at risk of choking . Mr Heys had an operation to install special implants in his gums to fix his dentures in place. He says if he puts the ill-fitting device in his mouth it aggravates problems in his  throat and stomach . Mr Heys said if he leaves his dentures out the three spikes can hurt his tongue and leave him at risk of choking. But if he puts the ill-fitting device in his mouth he said it aggravates problems in his mouth, throat and stomach. Calls to the patient advice service Healthwatch Kirklees and his MP have failed to bring any assistance. Mr Heys believes his problem is urgent, but it  is now more than two years since he began asking dentists for help . A spokesman for Leeds Dental Institute said: 'Mr Heys is a long-standing patient and we have been doing our best over a number of years to help him with his dental implants and over-denture. 'Unfortunately the original O-rings for his implant system are no longer available. 'However to assist him we did manage to source O-rings for his retained over-denture from another supplier. These allow an appropriate fit and are designed to last up to a year. 'He was seen by us recently after a referral and his fractured denture was repaired, and on that basis he was discharged from our care. 'Ongoing maintenance and repairs of his dentures can and should be undertaken by a primary care dentist in conjunction with a dental laboratory. 'The Dental Institute is a specialist centre for complex procedures and it is not the most appropriate use of our time and skills to continue to undertake primary care maintenance of dentures, nor is it in the best interests of Mr Heys in getting a timely response to his ongoing needs. 'Our existing workload means that specialist secondary care and appointments at the Dental Institute are booked up six weeks ahead. 'None of Mr Heys' dental requirements are classed as clinically urgent and they are most appropriately dealt with in primary dental care. 'Separately from this, Mr Heys does have the option of replacing his implant attachments with a more universal system. 'This has been discussed with him previously.

"The twin sister of Down syndrome baby Gammy will be allowed to stay with her Australian parents despite her father's history of child sex offences. David and Wendy Farnell caused outrage earlier this year when they abandoned Gammy with his Thai surrogate mother but took his healthy sister Pipah back to Bunbury in Western Australia. After the scandal broke, it was revealed Farnell, 56, had been convicted of 22 child sex offences in the late 1990s, committed while he was in his 20s, including one against a girl who was just seven. Since then authorities in WA have been looking at whether the Farnells are suitable parents and should be allowed to care for baby Pipah. Scroll down for video .

Blige, left, is pictured here with her dad Thomas Blige,63,  who was stabbed in January . According to Battle Creek police, officers had been called out several times to deal with allegations of domestic violence between White and Blige, who appeared to be in a relationship. Detective Sgt. Jim Martens told the Battle Creek Enquirer that the incident occurred when Blige saw White letting the air out of his tires. He reportedly confronted her and she fled, but when he caught her she stabbed him with a kitchen knife. The detective revealed officers found blood in the snow outside before discovering the victim and attacker each in their own homes. Blige suffered stab wounds to his neck, chest and arm and was taken to Bronson Methodist Hospital in Kalamazoo, Michigan to undergo surgery and remained in a critical condition for some time. But he made a full recovery according to The Detroit Free Press. Police had charged White  with assault with intent to commit great bodily harm for the stabbing. Care: White has been ordered to pay $17,290 to Mary Jane Productions for Blige's nursing services which were paid for by his daughter, the singer, Mary J Blige, pictured here, . In September, White pleaded no contest to the charge and as part of a plea agreement prosecutors agreed she would not be sentenced to more than a year in jail. Judge Conrad Sindt accepted the agreement but placed White on five years of probation. White has now been ordered to pay $17,290 to Mary Jane Productions for nursing services that his daughter paid for to care for Blige. During sentencing, White stood with her  attorneys, Jeffrey and Kimberly Schroder and cried quietly, but she told the judge that she had no comment. Sindt ordered White not to have any contact with Blige during her probation and to complete all required counseling and mental health treatment. Blige moved out of state after the incident, officials said, and was not present in Calhoun County Circuit Court when White was sentenced. Mary, 43, has not commented on the incident.","Cheryl White, 50, from Battle Creek, Detroit was sentenced to 365 days in the Calhoun County Jail .

"Nick Clegg last night risked civil war in his party as he insisted Lord Rennard should not rejoin the Lib Dem group in the Lords unless he apologises over sexual harassment allegations. It came as a former party activist, who claims to have been the victim of ‘scary’ unwanted advances after Lord Rennard trapped her in a room, attacked the party for letting him get off scot-free. Party leader Mr Clegg’s comments came after he was warned that he would face a rebellion by Lib Dem peers if he tried to remove the party whip from Lord Rennard. Alleged victim Alison Smith (left) said Lord Rennard (right) had touched her intimately. She added that the . party had carried out a secretive inquiry which failed to properly . investigate whether the peer had brought the Lib Dems into disrepute, . leaving no one satisfied . Under party rules, peers would have to ratify any such decision. Peers are due to meet on Monday when Lord Rennard is expected to be welcomed back into the fold. And Mr Clegg was placed under further pressure last night after more than 100 Lib Dem activists signed a letter urging him to demand the withdrawal of the whip from Lord Rennard if he fails to apologise. The letter’s signatories include the party’s youth wing, Liberal Youth, former parliamentary candidates and local councillors. Last night, a Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘Nick Clegg is of the view that, as long as Lord Rennard refuses the very reasonable request from Alistair Webster QC to apologise, that it is inappropriate for him to rejoin the Liberal Democrat group in the House of Lords. 'Nick has communicated this to the Chief Whip and Leader of the House of Lords group.’ This week Lord Rennard escaped punishment over the sexual harassment claims, despite the party’s inquiry finding the evidence against him was ‘credible’. The former Lib Dem chief executive was told to apologise to the women who had complained. But in a humiliating blow to Mr Clegg, he refused to say sorry. Nick Clegg last night risked civil war in his party as he insisted Lord Rennard should not rejoin the Lib Dem group in the Lords unless he apologises over sexual harassment allegations . Alleged victim Alison Smith said the party had carried out a secretive inquiry which had failed to properly investigate whether the peer had brought the Lib Dems into disrepute, leaving no one satisfied. Another alleged victim, Alison Goldsworthy, described the result of the investigation as ‘deeply depressing’. She said: ‘The party has found itself sitting in an absurd no man’s land where it is unable to install a sanction against Chris Rennard but instead can ask him to apologise to us. Something he very clearly has no plans to do...We should look to Nick Clegg to firm up his position and show some of his moral courage. That would involve an ultimatum.’ And a third alleged victim, Lib Dem parliamentary candidate Susan Gaszczak, told the party leadership to ‘man up’ and take action over Lord Rennard. Yesterday Miss Smith told BBC Radio 2’s Jeremy Vine Show that she had made complaints about Lord Rennard’s ‘inappropriate behaviour’ on two occasions, five years apart. The first was in 2002 when she was ‘very young, very green and new to the Lib Dems’. It made her feel ‘very uncomfortable’ but at that time he accepted that she had said no. ‘I asked around and people said, “Oh yes stay away from Lord Rennard – he has a bit of a reputation as a lech”. But it’s easier said than done; it’s a workplace.’ Five years later he made advances again but she said ‘the problem this time is that he really did not want to take no for an answer’. She said he touched her intimately. She added: ‘I felt trapped in that room. He said I couldn’t leave – it actually turned out to be quite a scary experience. I had to raise my voice and threaten to call the police. ‘It’s one thing to be working with someone who’s a bit of a lech, it’s another thing if you’re actually feeling your safety is under threat.’ She said she did not immediately go to the police because, having a law degree, she knew the police would not see it as a criminal matter. She went on to criticise the Lib Dem investigation. She said: ‘It satisfied nobody... They’ve failed completely to look at this issue of whether he brought the party into disrepute or not. ‘I’m absolutely with people who complain about the secrecy of the whole thing. There has to be a due process, it has to be at least some degree of transparency.’","Alleged victim Alison Smith said Lord Rennard had touched her intimately .

"Dauntless: Sgt Steve Brown found himself fighting for his life after confronting Ahla Timofei, 26, in the street after he attacked a defenceless young woman . A policeman who tackled a deranged attacker as he slashed at him with a samurai sword was named the bravest officer in England and Wales last night. Sgt Steve Brown found himself fighting for his life after confronting Ahla Timofei, 26, in the street after he attacked a defenceless young woman in North London. The knifeman repeatedly lunged at him with the weapon until the officer moved inside its arc and struck him with his metal baton. Timofei dropped the sword and Sgt Brown leapt on top of him, holding him down until colleagues arrived. When they searched his rucksack they found a terrifying arsenal of weapons including a crossbow, mallet, machete and gas masks. Met officer Sgt Brown was named the overall winner of the Police Bravery Awards at a ceremony in Central London. Sgt Brown was presented with the award, which is organised by the Police Federation, by Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe. Earlier, the officer and 65 of his colleagues from 31 forces attended a Downing Street reception with Prime Minister David Cameron. He beat off competition for the overall title from other officers who performed incredibly brave acts in the line of duty. They included: . - Pc Luke Gribble, of Avon and Somerset Police, who rescued a woman from rapidly rising flood water on the outskirts of Bristol. - Three Cumbria officers, PCs Glenn Myerscough, Kevin Latham and Andrew MacFarlane, who tackled an armed gang. - Essex officers Pcs Keith Lucas and Shane Robinson who rescued a man who exploded in flames after soaking himself in petrol. - Two North Wales officers, Pcs John Harrison and Sgt Gareth Davies, who dealt with a gunman who claimed to have a bomb in Wrexham town hall. - Sgt Christopher Foster who tackled a gunman who was beating another man with a long piece of wood during a snowstorm in Barnsley. - Pc Roger French who went into a smoke-filled burning building in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, three times to drag two men to safety. - Two Suffolk officers, Pcs Paul Osmond and Rebecca Gardiner, who stopped a drunk and distressed man from disembowelling himself and attacking them. The dramatic confrontation involving Sgt Brown took place when he was called to an attack on a woman in Holloway Road, North London. The knifeman repeatedly lunged at him with the weapon (pictured) until the officer moved inside its arc and struck him with his metal baton . Witnesses heard the victim's screams after Timofei set upon her with his sword, severing her thumb and leaving her with wounds to her face, arms and legs. As his partner gave first aid to the bleeding 22-year-old Italian woman, Sgt Brown confronted the sword-wielding maniac alone. Describing what happened, Sgt Brown said: ‘I was running full pelt at him and he turned around and raised the sword straight up in the air. ‘He swung downwards and the sword missed my neck by about a foot. I stepped back and said ‘put the sword down’, but he didn’t listen and took a few more swings. ‘After spraying him he went to scratch his eye and I thought, I’ve got to do this now. I rushed in and he raised his sword again but I hit his arm as many times as I could and managed to jump on top of him and the cavalry arrived. ‘I could see in his eyes he wanted to kill me. I wasn’t going to see Christmas: I thought my luck had run out.’ Timofei, 26, was later found guilty of attempted murder and affray and a judge ordered that he spend the rest of his life in a secure mental health unit . When officers searched the attacker's rucksack they found a terrifying arsenal of weapons including a crossbow, mallet, machete and gas masks . Sgt Brown was guided to the swordman by a passer-by who saw the original attack and followed him while on the phone to a police operator. The officer said: ‘I have no doubt that he wasn’t going to stop until he killed someone that night. I also have no doubt that any cop would have done the same. ‘I’m not a hero: the real hero is the member of the public who went above and beyond and followed him, having seen what he had done.’ Timofei, 26, was later found guilty of attempted murder and affray and a judge ordered that he spend the rest of his life in a secure mental health unit.

Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘The actions of Sgt Stephen Brown are a powerful reminder of the commitment and courage that police officers bring to their role. ‘He put his own life in danger to defuse a terrifying situation. His intervention protected the public and may well have saved the lives of others. ‘We should reflect on the bravery shown by all the officers nominated, and that displayed by all police officers in the course of their duties each day.’ Steve White, chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: ‘I am constantly humbled and amazed by the selfless acts of bravery carried out by police officers on a day to day basis. ‘For every act of courage and bravery recognised in the Police Bravery Awards there are hundreds more that occur in our communities every day that go unrecognised.’ Three Cumbria officers, PCs Glenn Myerscough, Kevin Latham and Andrew MacFarlane, who tackled an armed gang .

"Charges: Stephen Kaufman, 54, faces criminal charges after he attempted to perform a procedure on a patient while he was drunk . A Tennessee dentist faces criminal charges after he attempted to perform a procedure on a patient while he was drunk and refused to stop the procedure even when authorities approached him, officials say. Stephen Kaufman, 54, of Hendersonville, was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment, driving under the influence, and violation of implied consent Thursday after allegedly operating on a 19-year-old patient while he was drunk. Authorities say that Kaufman smelled of alcohol and had red, watery eyes while attempting to perform the procedure in a T-shirt, running shorts, and flip flops, according to the Tennessean. Shelly Maichuk told WSMV that she was waiting for the 19-year-old, her nephew, outside of Cheatham Family Dentistry in Ashland where he was getting his wisdom teeth pulled when employees left the building proclaiming that Kaufman was drunk. 'Patients started coming out of the building,' Maichuk said. 'They started telling me that he was intoxicated. They could smell the liquor on his breath.' Maichuk reportedly got her nephew out of the dentist's chair immediately, but he had already been sedated for the procedure. Authorities say that Kaufman had only been in his office for about an hour before the police were called. Twice: Kaufman was reprimanded by the Tennessee Department of Health twice in the past, once in 2003 and again in 2007. Employees: Shelly Maichuk said she was waiting for her 19-year-old nephew outside of Cheatham Family Dentistry in Ashland where he was getting his wisdom teeth pulled when employees left the building proclaiming that Kaufman was drunk . Gymwear: Authorities say Kaufman smelled of alcohol and had red, watery eyes while attempting to perform the procedure in a T-shirt, running shorts, and flip flops, and was unsteady on his feet in the office . 'He [Kaufman] was so disoriented,' Maichuk said. 'He didn't even recognize the police were coming. He didn't even realize that the patient was already up out of the chair.' Ashland City Chief Deputy Kenny Ray told WSMV that it was obvious that Kaufman was intoxicated. When authorities arrived, Kaufman told them he had not been drinking but later admitted to having been drinking four or five hours earlier, the Tennessean reports. Kaufman reportedly failed three field sobriety tests and was unsteady on his feet in the office. A witness reported seeing Kaufman driving to his office before the incident, therefore Kaufman was given a DUI. Kaufman disputes these accusations and told the Tennessean that he believes an angry employee called the police making the false accusations. 'I was not incapacitated in my office,' Kaufman said calling the allegations inflammatory and inaccurate. Kaufman also questioned the DUI claiming officers never saw him driving his vehicle. Dispute: Kaufman disputes these accusations and said that he believes an angry employee called the police making the false accusations . Obvious: Ashland City Chief Deputy Kenny Ray said that it was obvious that Kaufman was intoxicated when authorities arrived at his office . Valid: Kaufman is still allowed to continue practicing with his license from the Tennessee Board of Dentistry still valid despite being reprimanded twice before . WSMV reports that Kaufman -- who is still allowed to continue practicing and his license from the Tennessee Board of Dentistry is still valid -- was disciplined twice in the past, according to Shelley Walker, a spokeswoman for the Tennessee Department of Health. Department of Health records state that in 2003 Kaufman was reprimanded for removing a tooth from an 11-year-old child at a Halloween party without consent from the child's parents. Kaufman was forced to attend a course on professional boundaries. Kaufman was forced to pay a $500 civility penalty and complete a class pertaining to record keeping after he failed to document that he had proper permission to perform a procedure on a patient in 2007.","Stephen Kaufman, 54, of Hendersonville, was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment, driving under the influence, and violation of implied consent Thursday after operating on a 19-year-old patient while he was drunk .

"Credit Suisse - the second largest bank in Switzerland with offices all over the world - is suing a hedge fund manager they mistakenly wired $1.5 million to, after the Florida man seemingly vanished within weeks of receiving the money. The Zurich-based bank claims in lawsuit papers filed in New York that the money was wired to Joseph B. Galbraith on January 13 via his hedge fund, Galbraith Capital Investment Management. However two weeks later, Credit Suisse realized Galbraith's company was 'winding down operations and it had no cash left in its account with Credit Suisse', according to The New York Times. Galbraith, who chose to renounce his US citizenship in 2011 after a messy divorce, said in email to Credit Suisse on February 5 he was 'dealing with his' and not to panic, however he hasn't been heard from since. Mistaken: Credit Suisse - the second largest bank in Switzerland with offices all over the world, including New York (pictured)  - wired a total of $1.5 million  to a U.S. hedge fund manager in three transactions in January this year, however later realized it was a mistake. The hedge fund manger, Joseph B. Galbraith, then vanished . The Times reported that Galbraith is presumed to be living in Europe with his second wife, who was born in Brazil. Credit Suisse contacted Galbraith's bank, the Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto, however they were informed Galbrraith had refused to give permission to reverse the transaction. Royal Bank of Canada said there was nothing more they could do. In the lawsuit filed by Credit Suisse, they claim Galbraith misled them and never intended to give the money back. Credit Suisse sued the fund and the manager. At a hearing in New York in August, the judge granted a judgment against the fund, but not against Galbraith. Galbraith has not been served, because his whereabouts remains unknown. However a Times reporter managed to contact him via email. 'Mr. Galbraith said he had not been aware of the Credit Suisse lawsuit,' the newspaper reported. 'In an email, he said the accusations against him were ''ridiculous, bordering on laughable'' and part of an effort to malign and slander his character.' It's presumed the emails cannot be traced. Galbraith is also reportedly in legal dispute with a computer technology company, who claim he owes them $130,000 in outstanding fees. Additionally, Monaco’s financial regulator posted a warning about Galbraith Capital, who’s people were, they said, cold-calling customers. Gailbraith's hedge fund was based in Safety Harbor, Florida, and once had $120 million under its management. During his 2011 divorce proceedings, his assets were listed as $5.7 million. However in the last few years, the capital of Galbraith Capital Investment Management had been flagging, The Times reported, and Galbraith started returning money to investors.","Joseph B.

"Thank you: Emily Ruckle pauses outside her family's car as she visits the Newark Police Department on the way home from the hospital after the severe dog attack last month . She almost lost her arm to a vicious dog attack last month, enduring nine surgeries to rescue it, but before she went home on Tuesday, Emily Ruckle went to thank the police who saved her life. The eight-year-old New Jersey girl stopped at Newark Police Headquarters after being released 30-days early, having surprised doctors with her recovery when she managed to lift her right shoulder. But before she went home to hug her family German shepherd, Kona, and even before she grabbed a bite at her favorite Chick-fil-A, Emily 'stopped to say thank you to the men in blue.' Arriving at the station with her mom Maria and dad, Todd, who is a Newark councilman, Emily greeted her heroes with a smile. Despite her release from hospital, Emily's recovery is not complete yet and she has months of intensive rehabilitation in front of her. 'It's a long journey, and we're all going to do it together as a family,' said Todd Ruckle to Delaware Online. 'We're going to get this arm better.' Emily was attacked on September 27 at her own family house while a dog belonging to her mother's ex-husband was being watched. Grateful: Newark Police Department's Cpl.

The dog, which was called Frank, was being looked after by Emily's half brother, according to Delaware Online. Recovery: Emily should have spent another month at least in hospital but was released due to the speed of her recovery . The dog attacked Emily when she let it out back, believing it needed the bathroom. The attack was vicious and left Emily with a wound so severe that her arm was nearly torn off. Emily Ruckle was bitten multiple times by the pit bull and suffered severe soft-tissue injuries and blood loss from the attackThe girl's sister called the emergency services and stemmed the bleeding until paramedics arrived. When officers arrived they shot the dog dead. She went through nine surgeries at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and had three of her severed nerve bundles reaatched. 'That could take nine months to see if that works,' Todd Ruckle said to Delaware Online. 'That's when we will find out if anything moves and if she gets feeling back in her arm.' 'But five days ago, after this, she could lift her entire shoulder up. So the doctor was really shocked that she could do that already.' Todd Ruckle told the Delaware Online that he was extremely happy and thankful for all the support he and his family have received. Indeed, a recent fundraiser online collected more than $30,000 for Emily's medical costs. 'Our entire family just wants to say thank you for the outreach, all the prayers, all the positive thoughts,' Todd Ruckle said. 'There are thousands and thousands and thousands of people that have wished us well.' Longtime Ruckle friend, Jerry Clifton, said that he was happy Emily had returned home. 'It speaks well to The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia that they managed to get her home so quickly, and I trust she'll heal well in the weeks to come,' said Clifton to Delaware Online. 'I think emotionally, it's better for her to be home, if possible.' Friends: This is Rona - Emily's beloved German shepherd who she was looking forward to seeing at home .

"Five babies have tested positive for a tuberculosis infection after being exposed to the deadly disease by a nursery healthcare worker at an El Paso hospital. The newborn babies were exposed to TB by the unnamed employee who worked on the maternity ward at Providence Memorial Hospital in El Paso, Texas. At least 700 babies and 40 employees were placed at risk of contracting the disease between September 2013 and August 2014, according to the El Paso Department of Public Health. Exposure: More than 700 babies and 40 employees at Providence Memorial Hospital were exposed to TB . Newborn: Parents of infants born between September 2013 and August 25 of this year were asked to come in for tests . However, officials said that the babies who tested positive do not have active TB which can destroy the lungs and be potentially fatal. Dr. Enrique Martinez told local TV station KVIA: 'These individuals [babies] do not have active tuberculosis. They are not sick. They are not contagious.' Four of the babies were given a vaccine called BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) that can generate false positives in this kind of testing according to the hospital, but all will be treated as a precaution. Last week, the El Paso Department of Public Health was given a list of babies who were exposed to TB and the department quickly notified their parents by mail, phone and e-mail. So far, 200 babies have undergone X-ray and skin tests, according to the health department. Hospital officials said that they 'should have done more' when the employee's symptoms were revealed during her annual screening in July. But at least 858 parents have received letters and phone calls asking them to come in for screening and that number will fluctuate as the investigation continues. Parents with infants born between September 2013 and August 2014 - when the unnamed female nurse was put on leave after testing positive for tuberculosis - underwent screenings. However hundreds of parents are still bringing their children in for testing, so that they can determine whether their babies have become infected. Update: A representative from Providence Memorial Hospital confirmed Saturday at a joint news conference five babies have tested positive for Tuberculosis infection . Department of Public Health: A spokesman said it's important to point out that the five children who tested positive are not considered to have the active TB . Robert Resendes, the Director of the El Paso Health Department, said that  they have the situation under control. Resendes said: ‘This is nothing new, it just may be a little larger than we are used to dealing with but it is something we know how to deal with.’ Most of the babies who were exposed to TB are now in Mexico or New Mexico, according to The El Paso Times. TB infection is spread through coughs and sneezes of an infected individual, but can lay dormant for years before becoming active, according to health officials. There are an estimated 22,000 tuberculosis cases reported in the U.S. each year.","More than 700 babies and 40 employees were exposed to TB .

"A father-of-three died when it took tour guides more than nine hours to get him to hospital after a motorbike crash in Mongolia, an inquest heard. Andrew Grennan, 43, suffered horrendous internal injuries after his Yamaha hit a pothole during a motorcycle holiday on June 7 this year. An inquest was told that Mr Grennan, a gas engineer from Walsall, was taken the 37 miles to a village and then to a town hospital at an average speed of just 4mph along the edge of the Gobi. Andrew Grennan, a father-of-three, died after  he came off his motorbike during a trip to Mongolia and it took nine hours to get him medical attention . Dr Caroline Taylor, who was providing back-up medical assistance, said she believed that Mr Grennan had a number of fractures and, because of his low blood pressure, an internal injury. On arrival at hospital at Altai at about 5pm, an air medical evacuation was considered but a CT scan revealed that he had a ruptured spleen and he was rushed into surgery to stem the bleeding. During the operation doctors discovered a staggering six pints of blood had collected in his abdomen. Tragically, the 'competent' motorcyclist failed to regain consciousness and was pronounced dead the following morning. Birmingham Coroner's Court heard today the motorcycle tour was organised by Nick Sanders Expeditions. Nick Sanders is a record-breaking motorcyclist and author who has travelled the world on his bike seven times. Mr Sanders, who has been organising trips since 1999, said 'These challenges are difficult. We were in the middle of the Gobi desert. There is only so much that anybody can do. The best thing to be is self-sufficient, which we were.' Mr Grennan, a gas engineer from Walsall, died after his motorbike hit a pothole, throwing him off and causing fatal injuries . Stephen James was one of a group of 18 who had been part of the eight-week trip. On the morning of June 7 he had left their camp, heading towards Altai and shortly afterwards had been passed by the father-of-three who he described as a competent rider. 'About 20 or 30 seconds later he hit a pothole. He lost the front, there was just dust and sand.' He said he found Mr Grennan lying in the recovery position next to his bike, which was a write-off. Coroner Elisabeth Bussey-Jones said 'It is clear that one of the significant factors was the remote location and the incredible difficulty of getting medical help.' She also said bosses should consider what could have been done better and how best to protect tourists travelling with them. She concluded that Mr Grennan died from a road traffic collision. Andrew Grennan was on a motorcycle holiday in Mongolia heading for Altai when he had a fatal accident . After the hearing Mr Grennan's widow Claire, 40, criticised expedition bosses for showing 'no sense of urgency' to get her husband potentially lifesaving treatment. Mrs Grennan – who is bringing up the couple's three children alone in Aldridge, Walsall, West Mids – said: 'Andrew absolutely loved his motorbike and he was really looking forward to this trip to Mongolia. 'He was very much a family man, very hard working and never complained about anything. 'Our family has been left heartbroken by losing Andrew in such tragic circumstances. 'As the extent of his injuries were horrific, we are desperate to find out why there was no sense of urgency to get him to hospital for potentially lifesaving treatment. 'We would like to thank the Coroner for looking into the accident for us and hope that with the help of our team at Irwin Mitchell we will be able to find answers to all of our questions.' Mr Grennan's sister Joanne Burford said 'Although the inquest answered some questions it has brought up other questions which were not answered. 'Why did they stop at a village where they knew there were not going to be any medical facilities? 'There were no satellite phones available.' Lesley Edwards, a specialist international personal injury lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, who represented the family, added: 'This has been an incredibly difficult time for the family who have understandably been devastated by their loss.","Andrew Grennan, 43, from Walsall, crashed his Yamaha after hitting pothole .

"The German government has called for Greece to hand control over its finances to the European Union in what would be an unprecedented expansion of Brussels' power. Under the plan,  in order for the embattled country to receive a second bail-out - now estimated at up to €145bn (£122bn) - a eurozone 'budget commissioner' would be given the power to decide Athens' tax and spending, . The proposed power grab, revealed today by the Financial Times, would be met by strong opposition in Athens, where anti-German protests have already been seen on the streets and in the media. Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papdemos is yet to comment on the proposal from Chancellor Angela Merkel's government. The plan would see his state stripped of its power to control tax and spending . Voters in Greece have already expressed anger about EU moves to . intervene in its reform process, and any proposal to surrender yet more powers to Brussels could prompt further protests. Under the extraordinary extension of European control, the commissioner would be able to veto . decisions taken by the Greek government if they were not in line with . targets set by international lenders. The proposal, which highlights the . deep level of mistrust between Greece and other EU countries, was apparently . circulated to finance ministry officials from the eurozone countries . yesterday afternoon. 'Given . the disappointing compliance so far, Greece has to accept shifting . budgetary sovereignty to the European level for a certain period of . time,"" the document reportedly says. ""Budget consolidation has to be put under a . strict steering and control system."" Many Greeks are already protesting against moves by the EU to force a cut in state spending . The German plan comes after months of worsening relationships between EU member states and Greece. The appointment of economist Lucas Papademos as technocratic prime minister in November has not helped improve attitudes towards the financially stricken country. The proposal comes amid intense . talks to finalise the second rescue package for Greece, which has . repeatedly failed to meet the fiscal targets set out for it by its . international lenders. Greece first needs to strike a deal with its . private sector creditors in the next couple of days to unlock its next . aid package and avoid a chaotic default. If it does not receive fresh aid, Greece could default as early as . March, when bonds totalling €14.5 billion (£12.2 billion) are due. Violent protests against cuts have already rocked the Greek capital and voters are unlikely to take kindly to EU moves to push through further reforms . Under . the proposal, Athens would only be allowed to carry out normal state . spending after servicing its debt. Creditors could be assured that . defaults would not occur in future. 'If a future (bail-out) tranche is not disbursed, Greece cannot threaten . its lenders with a default, but will instead have to accept further . cuts in primary expenditures as the only possible consequence of any . non-disbursement,' the Financial Times quotes the document as saying. Athens has not yet responded to the proposal. A senior Greek finance ministry official said it was unaware of the plan and so was not able to comment. 'No country has put forward such a proposal at the Eurogroup,' a Greek finance ministry official said on condition of anonymity, adding that the government would not formally comment on reports based on unnamed sources. Meanwhile, Greece's international lenders have apparently increased the figure they believe the indebted country will need from the euro zone from 130 billion (£109bn) to 145 billion euros (£122bn). German news magazine Der Spiegel reported that the extra 15 billion (£13bn) euros were needed because of the deteriorating economic situation in Greece. Der Spiegel quoted a representative of the troika of foreign leaders - the European Commission, IMF and the European Central Bank - saying: 'We're assuming that it won't be possible to collect missing money solely from the private creditors.' Talks with private creditors on swapping existing Greek bonds for longer-term debt made significant progress on legal and technical issues and will continue Saturday, both sides said late on Friday. A preliminary deal could be sealed by Sunday evening, a Greek government official said, with the aim of submitting a public offer to bondholders by Feb. 15. However, EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn told Reuters on Thursday more public money will be needed to make up a shortfall in the second bailout for Greece even if private bondholders agree to take a share of losses. Rehn said euro zone governments and EU institutions would need to make up the difference so that Greece's public debt can be reduced to close to 120 percent of annual output by 2020, seen as a more sustainable level. 'We are preparing a package which will pave the way for a sustainable solution for Greece, and in that package, yes, on the basis of the revised debt sustainability analysis, there is likely to be some increased need of official sector funding, but not anything dramatic,' Rehn said. It was the first time a top EU official had spelled out that more public money than the planned 130 billion euros would be required for a second Greek bailout package. Germany, France and other euro zone states have so far described the 130 billion (£109bn) figure agreed in October as a red line that must not be crossed. Rehn declined to say how big the funding shortfall would be. But an EU source said there could be a funding shortfall of 12 to 15 billion euros.","EU 'to be given veto power over tax and spend plans'

"The son of Romania's 'King of Gipsies' is getting ready to marry his fiancee as she turns 18 later this year - and the couple already have twins together. Dorin Cioaba, 44 has announced that his son Bogdan, 20, will marry girlfriend Andreea as soon as she comes of age. According to Romanian media, 500 guests . have already been told to expect an invitation to the ceremony, despite . no firm date being set. Scroll down for video . Bogdan Cioaba, 20 (right), is expected to marry his fiancee Andreea (left) after she turns 18 later this year. Despite their young age, the couple already have twins together . Andreea (left and right, with her identity obscured) and Bogdan were engaged to each other by their parents while they were children as is common in Roma communities . The couple were engaged to each other as children by their parents, and while their families have never released Andreea's exact age, this latest announcement means she will be turning 18 soon. It is anticipated that the wedding will take place in the Transylvanian city of Sibiu in central Romania sometime in the autumn. Bogdan's father, Dorin Cioaba, 44 (pictured), became King of the Gipsies after his father Florin died of a heart attack last year . The ceremony will likely be timed mark the one year anniversary of the death of the former 'King of Gipsies' Florin Cioaba, who is Bogdan's grandfather. Florin, who proclaimed himself 'King of Roma Everywhere', died on 18 August 2013 of cardiac arrest at the Akdeniz University in Antalya in Turkey. It is expected that his two great-grandchildren, Bogdan and Andreea's twins, will also be officially baptised at the autumn ceremony. A spokesman for the family confirmed: 'She is still under 18, and therefore we want to protect her privacy until after the wedding. 'When the wedding happens then all the questions of the curious will be answered.' The spokesman also confirmed that all of Bogdan's family had fallen in love with Andreea as she was 'beautiful and kind' but also an 'obedient and dutiful daughter-in-law'. The marriage will make the couple's two twin children the next in line to the Roma crown. Roma have often clashed with officials in Romania over their beliefs, especially the controversial tradition of marrying their children off young. Many engagements in Roma communities are arranged by parents when the youngsters are still under ten years old. Confirmation ceremonies, which are held to formalise the union, have been known to take place with children as young as eight. Dorin (right) was crowned King of International Roma following his father's death, while his younger brother Daniel (left) was crowned King of Romanian Roma . Although the Gipsy King's family have stated in the past that they are not in favour of under-aged marriages, Dorin's sister Ana Maria Cioab was at the centre of an international row after she was married aged 12. The huge and highly controversial public ceremony saw her married to 15-year-old Mihai Birita. The affair caused outcry, and was even raised in the European Parliament after Romania came under fire for not taking action against the Roma. Dorin's father Florin eventually apologised for the decision and agreed to work with Romanian officials to make sure the age of consent was raised within Roma communities.","Bogdan Cioaba, 20, and Andreea were engaged while they were children .

"A six-year-old girl whose mother feared had broken her back was left lying face down for three hours while she waited for an ambulance - despite five frantic 999 calls. Kiera O'Brien was left screaming in pain after she fell off a bouncy castle at a family birthday party and landed painfully on her face. Her terrified mother Karen Robinson, 38, was too scared to move the crying youngster for fear of doing permanent damage and frantically called for an ambulance. Karen Robinson, 38, was left terrified when her daughter Kiera O'Brien, six, fell off a bouncy castle at a family wedding and lay on the floor crying in pain . Mrs Robinson dialled 999 and said she was too scared to move her daughter, fearing she had broken her back . Mrs Robinson said Kiera was 'very frightened and in a lot of pain' while waiting for the ambulance . But despite five desperate calls it took almost three hours for paramedics to arrive and take the little girl to hospital - which was just ten minutes away. Bosses at North East Ambulance Service have apologised for the delay but Mrs Robinson, from Sunderland in the North East, said she was 'fobbed off' and blamed the wait on cuts. Mrs Robinson said: 'It is ridiculous that it took so long. 'Five different people called asking for updates on when the ambulance would arrive. 'I think it is absolutely disgusting for a six-year-old girl to be left lying on a cold, hard floor for three hours. 'They said they had other priority call outs, such as heart attacks, but we felt like we were being fobbed off. 'I don't blame the paramedics, they were brilliant when they arrived. It has to be to do with cuts in the service. 'She was very frightened and in a lot of pain while waiting for the ambulance. 'Luckily, she didn't have a broken back.' Kiera was at her relative's eighth birthday party at the Holy Rosary church in Farringdon, Sunderland, on Sunday, when she toppled off the bouncy castle. Her family called for an ambulance at around 2.15pm, but a paramedic didn't arrive until 5pm, followed by an ambulance which took her to Sunderland Royal Hospital. The youngster - who is still off school with bruising - was released after medics confirmed she had not broken her back. Recalling the ordeal, Mrs Robinson said: 'There was a bouncy castle and Kiera does love to go wild on them. 'She jumped quite high and fell off, hitting the floor. She landed and she was screaming in agony. 'We didn't want to move her as we were worried it might do more damage, it was absolutely terrifying, I felt helpless. 'You can tell the difference between the noise your child makes when they have a scrape or tumble and when they are really hurt. Despite five frantic calls to the ambulance service, paramedics took almost three hours to arrive . Kiera was rushed to Sunderland Royal Hospital in an ambulance - a journey that took ten minutes . 'She fell at about 2.15pm and we called the ambulance straight away. 'We called about five times. The hospital is only about 10 minutes away so we expected an ambulance to turn up pretty soon. 'The rapid response ambulance turned up at about 5pm and another ambulance came at about 5.15pm.' A spokeswoman for North East Ambulance Service apologised and blamed the delay on a 'high volume of emergency 999 calls'. She added: 'We are sorry that on this occasion we did not reach the patient as quickly as we would normally have liked. 'Unfortunately, no ambulance crews were immediately available due to a high volume of emergency 999 calls. The first call came in at 2.16pm, and our Rapid Response paramedic arrived at 4.56pm, followed by an ambulance.'","Kiera O'Brien, 6, fell off a bouncy castle at a family birthday party .

"Five-year-old British brain cancer patient Ashya King has left intensive care in a hospital in Prague after undergoing potentially life-saving treatment. Jana Kulhankova, spokeswoman of the Proton Therapy Centre of Prague, said the boy had been moved into his own private room following another round of proton beam therapy. 'Ashya left the intensive care unit on Tuesday and has been put in an individual room,' she said. He has 'started to put on weight, he is smiling, and he is reacting to the gestures of his parents and those close to him,' she added. Scroll down for video . Ashya King has been moved from intensive care to his own private room after undergoing another round of potentially life-saving proton beam therapy, a spokesman for his hospital in Prague said . Ashya's older brother Naveed (pictured), yesterday revealed that charity Kids N Cancer were refusing to release £50,000 raised for Ashya's treatment to the family, after the NHS agreed to cover the cost . Proton beam therapy uses a stream of fast-moving subatomic particles to destroy cancer cells, and is similar to conventional radiotherapy, but causes less damage to surrounding tissue. Ashya has already undergone several round of the treatment, with the thirtieth and last of the sessions will take place on October 24. His case made headlines after his parents, Brett and Naghemeh King, fled Southampton General Hospital with their son in September. The pair were concerned about the side effects of treatment he was to receive in the UK, and instead wanted to have the boy treated with proton beam therapy in Prague. When the NHS said it would not fund the treatment, they fled to Spain where they planned to sell a house before travelling on to Prague. However, Hampshire Police issued a European Arrest Warrant after discovering the family had left hospital in the UK and the couple were held by police in Malaga in Spain. Ashya was taken to hospital and the Kings were told none of the family could visit him. The couple were held in prison for 72 hours before international outcry - including criticism of the 'heavy handed' treatment from Prime Minister David Cameron - led to the order to release them. Following tests Ashya was deemed suitable for proton beam therapy, and in an usual move the NHS agreed to fund the treatment on September 26. Ashya's case rose to prominence after the boy's parents were arrested in Spain while trying to take their son abroad for treatment, afraid that the radiotherapy used in the UK would cause excessive damage to his brain . But in further controversy, a children's charity that raised £50,000 to fund Ashya's treatment said yesterday that it would not be handing over the money because the NHS was covering it. Ashya's older brother, Naveed, said the family has sent a request to Kids N Cancer for the money to cover the cost of their legal bills, but were branded 'greedy' by the charity. He wrote on Facebook: 'We have asked Kids n Cancer to support us with paying for the legal fees involving the custody and the release of my parents from prison as well as living expenses whilst we are in Prague. 'Kids n Cancer came back with a reply saying that they were not willing to help us, they said we are greedy asking for help... 'Kids N Cancer have never given us any money and they are refusing to help us now.' Kids n Cancer said while it had been prepared to meet the £100,000 cost of the treatment in Prague, because the money had been donated specifically for the therapy this would now be used to help other children in similar need. The charity said it was not able to use the money to cover the legal costs incurred by the family because this was not part of the charity's aims.","Ashya has been moved to private room says Prague hospital spokesman .

"President Dilma Rousseff was re-elected on Sunday after a tight runoff vote against a centrist challenger. Brazil's leftist candidate secured a slim majority of the vote against Aecio Neves, as her anti-poverty program proved too popular for his pro-business platform. The campaign split the country, with Rousseff winning 51.6 percent against Neves with more than 99 percent of votes in. Victory: Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff was re-elected Sunday after a tight race against centrist Aecio Neves . Supporters: Fans of Rousseff waved flags with her name and the symbol of the Worker's Party during a ceremony celebrating her re-election . Rousseff's election marks a continuation of her Worker's Party in control of Brazil's executive branch, which it has held since 2003. In São Paulo, the capital of Brazil's wealthiest state, where Neves's Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) enjoys a large following, the mood was subdued. In Brasilia, Rousseff took the stage in front of red banners emblazoned with photos from her days as a militant fighting the military dictatorship. 'My dears, my friends, we have arrived at the end of a campaign that intensely mobilized all the forces of this country,' she said 'I thank every Brazilian, without exception.' Rousseff became the country's first woman president after her election in 2010. Born into an upper-class family, she became a socialist after the 1964 coup and was arrested and reportedly tortured by the regime. In her speech Sunday, she expressed her gratitude to Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who she served as chief of staff during his second presidential term and who tipped her to run in 2010.

Support: Rousseff became the country's first woman president after her election in 2010. Born into an upper-class family, she became a socialist after the 1964 coup and was arrested and reportedly tortured by the regime . Jubilation: Many supporters waved flags and wore T-shirts emblazoned with photos from her days as a militant fighting the military dictatorship . Relief: Rousseff's party often stoked fears among voters that if the PSDB returned to power, so too would the rampant inequality that defined Brazil pre-Lula . Narrow win: Rousseff's administration has said it will push for a national reconciliation, as the narrow vote split Brazilians between the president and Neves after a bitter campaign . Under Lula, the country's economy grew steadily, while programs targeting the poor were able to lift millions out of poverty, increasing wages and dropping the unemployment rate to 4.9 percent. According to Forbes, during the eight years of Lula's presidency, the ranks of the middle class ballooned, with the amount of Brazilians with bank accounts going from 70 million to 115 million. But the pace of growth slowed under Rousseff, who has been criticized for intervening too often in the Brazilian economy, leading to unpredictability in the market. Rousseff has also been blamed for deteriorating public services, like healthcare, and numerous incidents of corruption, notably a bribery scandal involving the state-run Petroleo Brasileiro. According to Forbes, during the eight years of Lula's presidency, the ranks of the middle class ballooned, with the amount of Brazilians with bank accounts going from 70 million to 115 million . 'There is one easy way to put an end to corruption: throw the Workers' Party out of office,' Neves insisted during the final debate between the candidates on Friday. Rousseff's party often stoked fears among voters that if the PSDB returned to power, so too would the rampant inequality that defined Brazil pre-Lula. 'We need Dilma to continue the programs that improve the lives of those in need,' said Livia Roma, 19, a university student in Sao Paulo, as she voted on Sunday. 'I didn't vote for myself, but for the minorities and less fortunate classes.' Ideli Salvatti, one of Rousseff's top ministers, said the government needed to bring forth 'a national reconciliation process . given how tight the result was.' 'We have to calm our hearts down first and then get back to . work tomorrow,' she told reporters. Brazil's investor class has been cold on Rousseff, and Brazil's markets took a tumble on poll results showing she was likely to win the runoff. Some fear another drop when they open Monday.","Dilma Rousseff of the Worker's Party took 51.6 percent against Aecio Neves with 99 percent of votes counted .

"Historic: President Barack Obama will make a groundbreaking visit to Burma later this month, it has emerged. He is pictured celebrating following his re-election on Tuesday . President Barack Obama will make history by becoming the first U.S. President to visit Burma, it has emerged. The visit -  which would be one of the first foreign trips following Obama's re-election on Tuesday - will take place on November 18/19, according to an official within the Burmese government. It will be part of Obama's efforts to encourage democracy in the Southeast Asian nation. The official, who did not want to be . named, said Obama would meet with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi as . well as government officials including reformist President Thein Sein. U.S. officials have not yet announced any plans for a visit, which would come less than two weeks after Obama's election to a second term. The Burmese official, speaking from the . capital, Naypyitaw, said today that security for the visit had been . prepared, but that the schedule was not final. Obama's administration has sought to encourage the recent democratic progress under Thein Sein by easing sanctions applied against Burma's previous military regime. Officials in nearby Thailand and Cambodia have already informally announced plans for visits by Obama that same week. Cambodia is hosting a summit meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and Thailand is a longtime close U.S. ally. The visit to Burma would be the culmination of a dramatic turnaround in relations with Washington as the country has shifted from five decades of ruinous military rule and shaken off the pariah status it had earned through its bloody suppression of democracy. Obama's ending of the long-standing U.S. isolation of Burma's generals has played a part in coaxing them into political reforms that have unfolded with surprising speed in the past year. The U.S. has appointed a full . ambassador and suspended sanctions to reward Burma for political . prisoner releases and the election of Nobel laureate Suu Kyi to . parliament. Groundbreaking: An official within the Burmese government said Obama would meet with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, right,  as well as reformist President Thein Sein, left . From Burma's point of view, the lifting of sanctions is essential for . boosting a lagging economy that was hurt not only by sanctions that . curbed exports and foreign investment, but also by what had been a . protectionist, centralised approach. Thein Sein's government has initiated major economic reforms in addition to political ones. A procession of senior diplomats and world leaders have traveled to Burma, stopping both in the remote, opulent capital city, which was built by the former ruling junta, and at Suu Kyi's dilapidated lakeside villa in the main city of Yangon, where she spent 15 years under house arrest. New Zealand announced today that Prime Minister John Key would visit Burma after attending the regional meetings in Cambodia. Significant: The most senior U.S. official to visit Burma was Hillary Clinton, who last December became the first U.S. secretary of state to travel to the country in 56 years . The most senior U.S. official to visit was Hillary Rodham Clinton, who last December became the first U.S. secretary of state to travel to the country in 56 years. The Obama administration regards the political changes in Burma as a marquee achievement in its foreign policy, and one that could dilute the influence of China in a country that has a strategic location between South and Southeast Asia, regions of growing economic importance. But exiled Burmese activists and human rights groups are likely to criticise an Obama visit as premature, rewarding Thein Sein before his political and economic reforms have truly taken root. The military - still dominant and implicated in rights abuses - has failed to prevent vicious outbreaks of communal violence in the west of the country that have left scores dead.","The visit -  which would be one of the first foreign trips following Obama's re-election on Tuesday - will take place on November 18/19 .

"As the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill, Blenheim Palace has a special place in British history. So it is with some astonishment that traditionalist visitors to the Oxfordshire stately home have found its grand apartments filled with modern art by Chinese dissident Ai Weiwei – including a giant pair of wooden handcuffs. And they are not happy, filling the visitors’ book in the chapel with angry complaints, accusing the exhibition of ‘defacing’ the Churchills’ ancestral home. 'Out of place': A piece called He Xie 2012, which is made up of dozens of porcelain crabs that cover the floor of the elegant Red Drawing Room, above, is part of Ai Weiwei's exhibition at Blenheim Palace . Defaced: In the Great Hall is a 5,000-year-old Han Dynasty vase which Ai has painted with a Coca-Cola logo . Heritage: Visitors to Blenheim Palace, above, have heavily criticised the modern art show in the apartments . Ai is perhaps most famous in this country for letting art lovers explore some 100 million porcelain sunflower seeds in the Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall in 2010 – a display which fell foul of health and safety legislation when the exhibit was found to create hazardous dust. Now it is his controversial photos in Blenheim’s Long Library, once Sir Winston’s favourite room, that are causing tension. Entitled Study of Perspective Series, they show the artist flicking his middle finger at significant buildings and locations including the White House and Tiananmen Square. The works are hung in front of 10,000 volumes of leather-bound books, collected by the 9th Duke, alongside portraits of Queen Anne, King William III and the 1st Duke of Marlborough. Offensive: Ai Weiwei's controversial photos in Blenheim's Long Library are causing tension. They show the artist, right, flicking his middle finger at significant buildings including the White House and Tiananmen Square . Also part of the exhibit is a piece called He Xie 2012, which is made up of dozens of porcelain crabs that cover the floor of the elegant Red Drawing Room. On the west side of the Great Hall is a 5,000-year-old Han Dynasty vase which Ai has painted with a Coca-Cola logo, and in the Salon is a Circle of Animals, made out of bronze with gold plating. Birthplace: The future PM, at the age of five . One of the most controversial objects in the exhibition is a pair of wooden handcuffs, created by the artist in 2012. They have been placed on the bed in the room where Lady Randolph Churchill gave birth to the former Prime Minister in 1874. The 13cm by 40cm handcuffs take pride of place in the bedroom, which also contains a lock of Sir Winston’s baby curls and an Ai portrait called a Hanging Man In Porcelain, made out of a coat hanger over the bed. However, visitors remained unimpressed. ‘The final photographs were disgusting and a terrible end to a wonderful tour!’ wrote one, while another added: ‘Beautiful house ruined by the vulgar art exhibition.’ ‘The photographs in the library are disrespectful and completely out of place here,’ a third said. ‘Loved the Palace,’ said another. ‘All I would expect from British Heritage. There is, however, no room at all for the irreverent Art.’ Ai – who was imprisoned in China in 2011 for 81 days and is currently forbidden to leave the country – was instrumental in choosing where the 50 exhibits were displayed after viewing the inside of the apartments on video. It is not uncommon for his works to sell for as much as £50,000, while the sunflower seeds made £486,000 when the work was sold at Sotheby’s. Last night John Hoy, chief executive at Blenheim Palace, remained unperturbed by the controversy. ‘As anticipated and, as is often the case with contemporary art, it is not really suited to everyone’s taste,’ he said.","Blenheim Palace, birthplace of Churchill, has special place in British history .

"In court: Rachel Farrell, 26, pleaded guilty to the affair with an 11th grade pupil at Bangor Area High School in Pennsylvania . A former high school teacher admitted today to having sex with a 17-year-old student. Rachel Farrell, 26, pleaded guilty to corrupting a minor in Northampton County Court, Pennsylvania. It emerged in February that the newlywed teacher had carried out the trysts in her car and in Ramada . Inns. She faces up to five years in prison when she next appears in court on May 25. Farrell was teaching reading to the 11th grade pupil at Bangor Area High School in Pennsylvania. The woman had only been married for two months when the sexual liaisons took place. She was teaching reading to the 11th grade pupil at Bangor Area High School. She later resigned and got divorced. Police also believed she may have had sex with three other students. However Assistant District Attorney Lara Mammana Kash declined to comment to local paper The Morning Call on the investigation into other potential victims. The victim, who is now 18, told police he and his teacher began communicating on Facebook and had sexual encounters 'numerous times at many different locations', including parking in secluded spots. Investigators said some of the encounters took place at a Walmart parking lot and twice at a Ramada Inn in Tannersville, . Monroe County. Scandal: Farrell resigned from her teaching post at Bangor Area High School and got divorced . Police said Farrell confessed to colleagues at the school that she had sex with two 17-year-old students, later also . admitting it to county Detective Robert Righi. Farrell was married in June 2010. The affair took place between August of the same . year and January 2011. Bangor Area High School is no stranger to controversy.

"Arsene Wenger is determined not to rush Theo Walcott back into action too quickly but will send him away on England duty with his blessing. Roy Hodgson will receive no special instruction from the Arsenal manager about how to treat the winger who has played only 10 minutes of competitive football since rupturing cruciate knee ligaments in January. Hodgson has called Walcott into the squad for a Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia and a friendly against Scotland. The winger has not played for England for more than a year. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail Premier League Preview: Swansea vs Arsenal . Theo Walcott was an unused substitute in Arsenal's Champions League match against Anderlecht on Tuesday . Walcott came on as a second-half substitute in Arsenal's win against Burnley last weekend . Despite playing just 10 minutes of competitive football since January, Walcott is in the England squad . On whether Walcott will start at Swansea on Sunday, Wenger said: 'If I decide to start he can start. 'He’s available. He has been chosen. He needs competition. He has been out 10 months. People think it’s like a machine. These are human beings and to get back into rhythm of top competition it takes time. 'Roy Hodgson is free to do what he wants. He has been injured in an accidental tackle against Tottenham and you cannot plan that it will never happen again. 'Every time you have a big injury there is a bigger chance of having the next one. He has been taken care of well. We have to leave him in peace and give him time to come back.' England international Walcott could make his first start since January when Arsenal travel to Swansea . Walcott, in training earlier this week, suffered a serious knee injury in Arsenal's FA Cup win over Tottenham . Arsenal head to Swansea off the back of a disappointing 3-3 draw against Anderlecht at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday evening. The Gunners were cruising to victory after goals from Mikel Arteta, Alexis Sanchez and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, but the visitors scored three times inside the final 30 minutes to leave the home fans reeling at the final whistle. Walcott went down injured in Arsenal's FA cup win over Tottenhm at the Emirates Stadium in January . Walcott reminded Tottenham fans of the score as he left the pitch on a stretcher . 'They were disappointed,' said Wenger of his side after the draw which left Arsenal's bid to top the group in tatters. 'It was a shock straight after game but we know we can score goals and we know we can do better defensively. Alexis Sanchez scored Arsenal's second goal against Anderlecht with 29 minutes gone at the Emirates . Arsene Wenger watches on from the bench as Arsenal throw away a three-goal lead against the Belgian side . 'It’s harder to put the first part in the game than the second part. Regardless of the score you have to play the right way. 'We are very positive. Inside our camp we are very positive. We are not touched by the criticism. When we don’t win we are not happy. The rest we can live with.' Anthony Vanden Borre struck twice for Anderlecht before Aleksandar Mitrovic's last-gasp leveller but the first goal was clearly offside. Aleksandar Mitrovic gets ahead of Per Mertesacker to haul Anderlecht level in the closing stages . Aaron Ramsey (centre0 looks dejected after his side allowed a three-goal lead to slip at the Emirates Stadium . And Wenger, who has long been a fan of technology in football, felt let down by the referee's assistant behind Wojciech Szczesny's goal and believes UEFA need to find a better way of making sure the correct decisions are made on the pitch. 'We can learn a lot from what happened on Tuesday,' he said. 'We have special incidents. Some things we can correct, like the second and third goals. But we cannot influence the first goal. When the goalscorers are one yard offside, we cannot influence that. 'Every time we go to Geneva, (Pierluigi) Collina (UEFA's chief refereeing officer) explains to us that the fifth referee is a fantastic finding. 'But when you see the pictures on the first goal, it is unbelievable. A guy stands behind the line in front of the offside guy and does not stay a word. 'I do not know what the guys behind the line are paid for. That is a general feeling shared by everyone who watches football. They should buy a seat for them, and give them a good book!' Wenger also labelled any of the criticism aimed at his side following the slip-up as 'predictable' after former Gunners favourite Paul Merson said the team were 'tactically clueless'. 'If you are 3-0 up and get back to 3-3, you always get the same,' Wenger said when asked about the criticism. 'I have managed 2,000 games and can anticipate what people will say. If you defend and get back to 3-3, people will ask why you defend and not continue to play a normal game. If you continue to attack, people ask why you attack. It is so predictable.'

"Phillipa Jutton was five times over the alcohol limit when she repeatedly crashed into a parked car . A woman repeatedly crashed into a parked car as she tried to escape while being five times over the legal limit to drive. Phillipa Jutton, 33, appeared to try to make a frantic escape after a passerby tried to talk to her after spotting her asleep at the wheel as her car rolled forward and crashed into a parked car. The resident appeared to startle Jutton into making a frantic getaway in her car, parked on a residential road. She then tried to get away from the road in Eastbourne in Sussex, crashing into the same car a further three times. When she was stopped by police in her Toyota Aygo she was breathalysed. Jutton was found to have 188mg of alcohol in her breath. This is more than five times the legal limit of 35mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath. A spokesman for Sussex police said Jutton had placed herself and others in danger by being in the car after she had been drinking. He said: 'Jutton was well over the limit but has refused to tell us what she was doing before she was found behind the wheel. 'So we do not know how long she was drinking for or why she decided to drive.

"An amazing set of pictures has given a new, rare glimpse into the lives of 1960s mining communities both in and out of the pits. The retro images show the working and social lives of the pit men proving that although the work was hard, they enjoyed lively 'out of hours' entertainment. The photos shine a light on the mining communities of Horden in County Durham and Workington in Cumbria, showing how the miners enjoyed their time off from the harsh conditions underground. Scroll down for video . Miners, who are covered in dust and soot, help each other to get clean in the showers after their shift at Horden Colliery in County Durham. Despite the hard work underground extracting the coal, the men seem to be in good spirits . Another two miners get changed out of their work clothes in one of the locker rooms at Horden Colliery.

Men still wearing their safety hats and head lamps gather around to listen to the speaker at a National Coal Miners' Union meeting in Workington, Cumbria in 1963.

The rare images also show the miners outside of work, enjoying a drink at a local working men's club in Horden while listening to an entertainer, left, with others playing a game of dominoes, right . The pictures come from the 1960s at a time when coal mining was the lifeblood of many small towns. But they show that despite the difficult work, many embraced a community spirit with the miners and their families socialising in the back streets and working men's clubs. And amid the sombre and severe light, it shows the workers in good spirits relaxing and showering after a hard day's work. It even shows how many enjoyed a drink and entertainment in their local working men's club as well as playing dominoes and tending to their racing pigeons. Meanwhile their children can be seen happy playing in the narrow back streets of their miners terraced houses. The collection of photos by awarding winning photographer Patrick Ward will be on display at the National Coal Museum in West Yorkshire, until January 2015. Mr Ward began his photography career in the 1960s, working for many newspapers, magazines and journals. The new exhibition also coincides with the launch of his new book called 'Being English'. The book showcases a collection of Mr Ward's work and explores the eccentricities of life in England. A punter collects his winnings during a whippet racing event for the miners in Horden.

"Snapchat is to show its users adverts for the first time this weekend. Despite not having a regular source of revenue, Snapchat was recently valued in the region of $10 billion (£6 billion). Co-founder Evan Spiegel revealed the plans to show adverts on the app last week - but the firm has so far refused to say who the first buyer is. 'This weekend we’re placing an advertisement in “Recent Updates” for Snapchatters in the United States,' the firm said. Scroll down for video . Co-founder Evan Spiegel revealed the plans to show adverts on the app last week - but the firm has so far refused to say who the first buyer is. Sponsored posts will  only show up on the app's Stories feature. Snapchat Stories add Snaps together to create a narrative. When a user adds a Snap to a Story it lives for 24 hours before it disappears, making room for the new. 'It’s the first time we’ve done anything like this because it’s the first time we’ve been paid to put content in that space. 'It’s going to feel a little weird at first, but we’re taking the plunge.' The firms 24-year-old co-founder Speigel told Vanity Fair's New Establishment Summit that sponsored posts will  only show up on the app's Stories feature. Snapchat Stories add Snaps together to create a narrative. When a user adds a Snap to a Story it lives for 24 hours before it disappears, making room for the new. Mr Spiegel said: 'People are going to see the first ads on Snapchat soon. We think they're pretty cool.' He added that the adverts will be opt-in, and users can choose to look at them, or skip. 'The best advertisements tell you more about stuff that actually interests you,' the firm promised today. 'An advertisement will appear in your Recent Updates from time to time, and you can choose if you want to watch it. No biggie. It goes away after you view it or within 24 hours, just like Stories.' The firm also admits exactly why it is introducing the feature. 'The answer is probably unsurprising – we need to make money. 'Advertising allows us to support our service while delivering neat content to Snapchatters. 'We promise that we’ll use the money we make to continue to surprise the Snapchat community with more terrific products – that’s what we love to do!' It also pledged it will never put ads in personal communications. 'That would be totally rude. We want to see if we can deliver an experience that’s fun and informative, the way ads used to be, before they got creepy and targeted.' Earlier this week, reports claimed Yahoo was reportedly preparing to invest £12 million ($20 million) in Snapchat. Despite not yet having a source of revenue, more than 100 million users use the app - which is apparently enough to convince companies to spend vast sums on the three-year old startup. Yahoo’s move follows an almost identical investment from venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byer in August. Facebook has used targeted advertising for years, and its Instagram app began rolling out sponsored posts (pictured left) to the US, Canada and the UK from June. Facebook also recently released 'local awareness' ads that help local business promote themselves to users (pictured right) Earlier this week, reports said California-based Yahoo (CEO Marissa Mayer shown making her keynote address in January 2014) is planning to invest £12 million ($20 million) in the three year-old tech startup. If true the investment would value the company at £6 billion ($10 billion) The move comes after a similar, albeit much larger, investment in Chinese technology firm Alibaba reaped huge dividends for Yahoo, with its $1 billion investment in 40 per cent of the company in 2005 now valued at tens of billions of dollars. This latest move, according to the Wall Street Journal, comes as Snapchat starts to seek funding from venture-capital firms, money managers and companies. Earlier this year Instagram  launched a new ephemeral messaging app called Bolt. The app, which functions in a similar way to Snapchat, allows users to quickly share self destructing photos or videos with a friend. Like Snapchat, the user can tap on a friend's face to instantly send a photo, or hold their finger down to send a video. However, Bolt only allows you to send messages to one person at a time, which makes it frustrating if you’re looking to distribute photos or videos to a group of friends. The favourites bar at the bottom of the app also only contains four friends, though you can apparently add up to 20 contacts in total. Bolt is currently only available in New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa ahead of a planned release in the rest of the world. Snapchat may be a key partner to Yahoo as it gets set to release Snapchat Discovery next year. This is a rumoured service that will display brief ads alongside news and video clips on the app, which will likely become a key source of revenue for Snapchat. Snapchat Discovery would provide a platform for Yahoo to distribute its own content. However, the £6 billion ($10 billion) valuation of a company that hasn't, yet, monetised its users, has been dubbed a risky proposition. That’s not to say it hasn’t worked before; Microsoft’s 2007 investment in Facebook valued the then three-year old company at £9.4 billion ($15 billion), and later proved hugely successful. Last year Snapchat infamously turned down a £1.8 billion ($3 billion) offer from Facebook - a decision that left many stunned. But the move seems to have paid off, as Snapchat’s owners Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy are set to become billionaires according to the current valuations of the company. If the valuation holds true, Snapchat would join a select club of tech startups with valuations of £6 billion ($10 billion) or more, including car-ride service Uber and rooms-to-let startup AirBnB.

Snapchat lets users send photo-messages that vanish within seconds, but is expected to soon begin offering advertising or branch out into additional services. This may include the ability to send instant money transfers to other users. Although Snapchat, and other similar mobile messaging apps, don't have established business models yet, its rapid user growth and perceptions of advertising potential have aroused intense investor interest over the past year or so. Snapchat is continuing to grow in popularity, with people sending more than 700 million disappearing messages a day. In June, Facebook launched a similar app called Slingshot in the hope of replicating Snapchat’s success. The app lets consumers exchange photos and videos, which later disappear, without requiring Facebook accounts. But despite its rapid growth, Snapchat has had a number of obstacles to contend with. The group this year settled charges with US regulators, which accused it of deceiving consumers by promising that photos sent on its service disappeared forever after a period of time. According to the Federal Trade Commission at the time, photos sent on Snapchat could, in fact, be saved by recipients using several methods, such as taking a screenshot.","Snapchat's Evan Spiegel said sponsored posts will appear on the app .

"The former Radio 1 DJ behind the ‘Ukip Calypso’ has denied it is racist – because some of his friends are from the Caribbean. Mike Read said the Ukip anthem, sung in a Jamaican-accent warning of ‘illegal immigrants in every town’, was just ‘a bit of fun’. He said: ‘I don't have a racist bone in my body. I work across all cultures and creeds, I travel the world.’ Mr Read added: I’ve got so many chums out in the Caribbean. I’ve spent a lot of time out there.’ Scroll down for video . Mr Read has launched a bid for chart success with a song singing the praises of Ukip and its leader Nigel Farage . Mr Read said he felt ‘absolutely terrible’ that people might be offended. He told BBC London: ‘I thought oh my god, that's not what I intended at all, I felt absolutely so low I cannot tell you. ‘People are very very very quick to take offence now at something that years ago would have been deemed to be a bit of satire and a bit of fun. ‘But now with social media everybody can assume that you meant something appalling by it, which of course I didn’t. I was terribly hurt that people thought that.' The Radio Berkshire added: ‘At the time it was a bit of fun, and that’s how you sing calypso. Looking back on it, maybe I shouldn’t have done it like that, I should maybe sung it straight or whatever, but it was just meant to be a bit of fun, and the fact that people are taking it like that is abhorrent to me. ‘In hindsight maybe I should have done it in a straight accent or who knows?’ But Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who has called for the song to go to Number 1 in the charts, dismissed claims it was racist. Mr Read's song has sparked accusations of racism for using a mock Jamaican accent . The song raises the issue of immigration with the lyrics: ‘Leaders committed a cardinal sin, open the borders let them all come in' He said: ""No, of course it’s not [racist]. Mike Reid has worked for the BBC for several decades, he’s in fact one of your corporation’s great stars, and he’s made a calypso song, and he said himself if he was doing a Bob Dylan song, he’d do Bob Dylan’s accent. It is meant to be a bit of fun."" The song raises the issue of immigration with the lyrics: ‘Leaders committed a cardinal sin, open the borders let them all come in, illegal immigrants in every town, stand up and be counted Blair and Brown.’ It continues: ‘Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again – when Nigel is at No 10.’ Other lyrics include digs at the European Union such as ‘With the EU we must be on our mettle, want to change our lawnmowers and our kettles. The EU live in wonderland, tried to ban bent bananas and British jam, we don't want jam the EU way, jam yesterday tomorrow but never today.’ Mr Read, a former Conservative supporter, also warns against trusting the Prime Minister, singing: ‘The British people have been let down, that's why Ukip is making ground. From Crewe to Cleethorpes, from Hull to Hendon, they don't believe Cameron's referendum. ‘The other parties will count the cost, in Eastleigh, Thanet, Thurrock and Boston, Labour and Tories shaking in their boots when Ukip kick them up the grass roots.’ The song also mentions Mr Farage’s love of ‘fags and beer’ and jokes about the frequency of his appearances on the BBC’s Question Time. Ukip’s Commonwealth spokesman Winston McKenzie defended the song. Appearing on Newsnight last night he said: ‘Ever since the beginning of time – the Beatles, Elvis, the Rolling Stones – they have taken off the black man. ‘What he has done is fantastic and the PC brigade have to grow up and get with it. The guy has made a song.’ Ukip's Commonwealth spokesman Winston McKenzie attacked the 'PC brigade' which had criticised the song . Mr Read, who currently hosts an afternoon show on BBC Berkshire, spent more than a decade at Radio 1. He hit the headlines in 1984 when he refused to play the Frankie Goes to Hollywood single, Relax, because he objected to its lyrics. A BBC spokeswoman said Mr Read had not breached the corporation's guidelines on impartiality by recording the song in support of the anti-EU party because he did not present a current affairs programme. The corporation added that the decision on whether to play the song was up to the discretion of individual programme producers. A BBC Radio 1 spokesman declined to comment on whether it would be played on if it enters the Top 40. He said: ‘The song is not currently on our playlist and, as the chart is compiled at the end of the week, we cannot say what will be in the Official Chart on Sunday.’ The song, which is being sold for 79p, yesterday reached as high as number 15 on the iTunes chart – but was back down to number 15 today. Some bookmakers put the track at 50-1 to go straight into the charts at Number 1 on Sunday. Mr Farage posted on Twitter: ‘Help get the UKIP Calypso by The Independents to Number 1.’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage has called on the party's supporters to get the song to Number 1 in the charts . The song had mixed reviews on Amazon. One wrote: ‘My god, the musical equivalent of the Ebola virus. Anyway, isn't calypso music a bit foreign for Ukip?’ Another review said: ‘A triumph. What a blend of cultures, using a Jamaican style to highlight some very British issues, and I would never have guessed the signer wasn't a native of the Caribbean but top pop DJ Mike Read.’ A further comment said: ‘John, Paul, George, Ringo, Farage.’ Some criticised Mr Read’s accent on the song. One wrote: ‘Surely we should have moved on from white men singing in funny accents? I found this song a sad reflection of a sick society.’ ‘Pretty sick with faux Jamaican accent. Shows UKIP in its true light as a nasty racist party,’ added another. In May, Ukip had to cancel a ‘carnival of colour’ with a steel band in Croydon after it descended into farce. The event was supposed to demonstrate the party welcomed members from all ethnic minorities, but rows broke out between supporters and demonstrators. The steel band stopped playing and packed up after they found out the event was in support of the party. Taxpayers’ money where does it go? Not even George Osborne knows, when we're in power and we engage, there will be no tax on the minimum wage. Leaders committed a cardinal sin, open the borders let them all come in, illegal immigrants in every town, stand up and be counted Blair and Brown. Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again when Nigel is at No. 10. The British people have been let down, that’s why Ukip is making ground, from Crewe to Cleethorpes, outer Hendon, they don't believe Cameron's referendum. Coalition could be a fact, with any party we could make a pact, stop telling lies about us do, and we’ll stop telling the truth about you. Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again when Nigel is at No. 10. Though our pensions scheme is in a mess, we need money for the NHS, to Jean-Cleade Juncker we’re giving away £55m a day. Oh what a farce he won the vote, this is my favourite Juncker quote, he looked a reporter straight in the eye and said “when things get serious it's time to lie”. Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again when Nigel is at No. 10. The EU live in wonderland, tried to ban bent bananas and British jam, we don't want jam the EU way, jam yesterday tomorrow but never today . The daily polls suggest somehow, Ukip are the third party now, in the euro elections we were so immersed, we weren't the third party we were the first . Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again when Nigel is at No. 10. With the government sitting on the fence, Ukip policy makes more sense, to get out of Europe is our target, Commonwealth not common market. Other parties please take note, Ukip is not a protest vote, so mark your cross and by word of mouth, tell them what to do in Thanet South. Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again when Nigel is at No. 10. With the EU we must be on our mettle, want to change our lawnmowers and our kettles, our hairdryers, smart phones and vacuum cleaners, but Ukip is wise to their misdemeanours. Farage likes his fags and beer, but there is one thing I want to get clear, now I like Nigel, he’s a friend of mine, but he appears more than Dimbleby on Question Time. Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again when Nigel is at No. 10. The other parties will count the cost, in Eastleigh, Thanet, Thurrock and Boston, Labour and Tories shaking in their boots when Ukip kick them up the grass roots. Meanwhile down at Clacton-on-Sea, Ukip are making history, Douglas Carswell, we're quite adamant, will be the first MP in parliament.

"Prolific: Michael Dwyer, pictured in a police mugshot in 2012, has 170 convictions to his name . A career criminal who clocked up 170 convictions has walked free from court again after being handed his fourth ‘last chance’ to turn his life around. Michael Dwyer, 31, had already been handed three ‘last chances’ by judges – two in 2004 and one in 2011 – after being convicted of dozens of burglary offences. But after he blamed his two decades of burglary, theft and violence on a drug problem this week a judge again decided to free the serial criminal. Recorder Tina Landale told him: ‘You have been a drug addict for most of your life and it’s clear you committed crime to support your drug habit. ‘But maybe this time you are willing to change and I am prepared to give you one last chance. Really take the chance. ‘Things are changing for you and you have got a much brighter future if you co-operate.’ Last night anti-crime campaigners condemned the judge as ‘weak-minded’ and said his release was an insult to his dozens of victims. Mohammed Iqbal, leader of Pendle Council, Lancashire, where Dwyer lives, said: ‘For someone to commit that level of crime over such a prolonged period of time shows what a menace he is to people. Clearly he has no regard for the law or the community. ‘What is the point in people reporting crime, or the police putting in all of the hard work in bringing him to court if this crook is just going to get a slap on the wrist. ‘This is Groundhog Day justice. Every time he commits a crime he’s told it’s his last chance, but clearly it isn’t. He just keeps on getting away with it time after time.’ Dwyer, a heroin and valium addict, committed his first crime when he was just 11, and by the age of 20 had racked up over 100 convictions. His first last chance came in July 2004, when he was in court for stealing a Hyundai coupe and almost mowing down a garage boss locking up his compound, causing £3,500 of damage before speeding off on a near 500-mile joyride. He admitted aggravated vehicle taking, theft and other motoring offences – but was merely given a 12-month drug treatment and testing order by magistrates, who told him: ‘You have a chance to sort yourself out.’ 'Groundhog Day:' Dwyer was given another 'last chance' by judge Tina Landale at Burnley Crown Court, pictured . But less than six months later, in December 2004, Judge Beverley Lunt also gave him ‘one last chance’ when he appeared before court, where he was convicted of stealing a van and handling stolen goods. In July 2004, Dwyer was in court after he stole a Hyundai Coupe and used it to mow down a garage boss,causing £3,500 worth of damage. He admitted aggravated driving, theft, two charges of driving while disqualified, damage and three allegations of no insurance. He was given a 12-month drug treatment and testing order. In December 2004, he was given another 12-month drug treatment and testing order for stealing a car and handling stolen goods. In September 2007, he was jailed for 90 days after he and his cousin used a stolen taxi to try and get cash to fuel their drug habit. In April 2008, he was jailed for 14 days after he and his brother went on a thieving spree. In February 2011, he was arrested for burglary after breaking into a diner and stealing from the till. He was given a 12-month community order, including supervision and a three-month nightly curfew. In January 2012, he was given six months in jail for affray. Three months after his release, he was jailed for another two years for raiding a pensioner's home. The latest offences happened in September this year when Dwyer was caught on his way to carry out a theft with a large wrench stuffed up his sleeve and a Stanley knife in his pocket. She handed him another 12-month drug treatment and testing order. Yet in September 2007 he was hauled back in front of a judge and jailed for 90 days after he and a cousin used a stolen taxi to try to get cash to feed their drug habits. In April 2008 he was back in court again and jailed for 14 days for stealing lead from roofs. Then Dwyer was arrested for burglary in February 2011, this time after breaking into a diner and stealing £45 from the till and £75 from under the counter. At the time he had a staggering 151 convictions – but was given another ‘last chance’ by the court with yet another 12-month community order with supervision and a three-month nightly curfew. His lawyers had argued he ‘had a chance to reflect on his life, with the imminent arrival of his second child’. But less than a year later, in January 2012, Dwyer was given a six-month sentence for affray over a fight in which he smashed a window. Unbelievably, just three months after his release he was again before the court after he raided a pensioner’s home when she was out. This time Judge Beverley Lunt – the same judge who had freed him in 2004 – sentenced him to two years in prison, telling him: ‘Nothing deters you.’ At his latest appearance before Burnley Crown Court this week, Dwyer was facing up to three years in jail after he was caught equipped for a theft with a large wrench up his sleeve and a knife in his pocket. But he walked away with a 12- month community order with supervision and a drug rehabilitation requirement – after a probation officer said Dwyer was ‘willing to address his behaviour’. Richard Taylor, defending, said Dwyer was on a methadone reducing programme and it was just over a year since he was last in trouble. A spokesman for Families Against Crime said: ‘This type of sentencing is no deterrent to hardened criminals and if judges can’t take a tough line on law and order then who will. Judges need to be strong not weak-minded. ‘This criminal appears to be untouchable and as long as that continues then he will carry on breaking the law and making people’s lives a misery.’ LAST CHANCE 1 July 2004: Dwyer admits aggravated driving and theft after stealing a Hyundai coupe and causing £3,500 worth of damage. Magistrates tell him he is being given ‘a chance to sort yourself out’ and hand him a 12-month drug treatment and testing order. LAST CHANCE 2 December 2004: He is given another 12-month drug treatment and testing order for stealing a van and handling stolen goods. Judge Beverley Lunt tells him he is being given a ‘last chance’ to get back on the straight and narrow. LAST CHANCE 3 February 2011: He is arrested for burglary after breaking into a diner and stealing from the till. He is given a 12-month community order and a three-month curfew after his lawyers say he has ‘had a chance to reflect on his life, with the imminent arrival of his second child’. LAST CHANCE 4 October 2014: Dwyer is caught on his way to carry out a theft with a wrench stuffed up his sleeve and a Stanley knife in his pocket. Recorder Tina Landale says she is giving him ‘one last chance’ to turn his life around with a community order.","Michael Dwyer, 31, from Nelson, Lancashire, carried out his first crime at 11 .

"Republican U.S. Senate candidate Ed Gillespie conceded his Virginia Senate race on Friday to Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Warner, telling supporters that he has no plan to seek a recount of more than 2.1 million votes cast – even though state law entitles him to one. The final vote tally from the State Board of Elections will show Warner ahead by less than 17,000 votes, or a margin of about three-quarters of 1 per cent. 'The votes just aren't there,' Gillespie said Friday, adding that he called Warner earlier in the day to congratulate him. Scroll down for video . Virginia Republican Senate candidate Ed Gillespie told his supporters on Election Day that his race was too close to call, but he gave up the fight three days later . Warner has 49 percent of the vote, Gillespie has 48 percent and Libertarian Robert Sarvis has 2 percent. Sarvis played the role of spoiler, earning verbal attacks from the state's conservative Republicans. 'This is why the political right needs to be united,' a Northern Virginia GOP political operative told MailOnline in an email Friday. 'A Sarvis comes along on an ego trip and produces an anomaly like this in the middle of an otherwise devastating landslide. It's frustrating.' Warner, a former governor who is one of Virginia's most popular politicians, had been expected to handily win a second term. But Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman, rode a wave of support for GOP candidates nationwide, and almost knocked Warner out of the Senate despite being outspent heavily. On Thursday, Warner told reporters he was confident that his lead would hold up. He said it would be unprecedented in Virginia for such a lead to evaporate in either the canvass, as the formal counting process is called, or a recount. Warner said he was focusing now on his next term, which would begin in January, and planned to promote a centrist agenda that could attract bipartisan support. He said he wants 'to show that we can get the Senate to actually work.' 'I will spend every day working to get the Senate back in the business of solving problems and not simply scoring political points,' Warner said in a statement. 'I will work with anyone, Republican or Democrat, to shake-up this dysfunctional Congress and move us toward common ground.' Gillespie's concession did not change the balance of the Senate. Tuesday's elections put Republicans in control with at least 52 of 100 seats in the chamber. The Alaska race between Democratic Sen. Mark Begich and GOP challenger Dan Sullivan remains uncalled, and in Louisiana, Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu and Republican Bill Cassidy are competing in a Dec. 6 runoff. Sen.

"Around five per cent of the world’s population suffer from hearing loss, and keeping up with conversation at a busy restaurant or in a group meeting, can be almost impossible – even if they are lip reading experts. But now there’s an app that translates speech into written words that show up on a smartphone, even when people are all talking at once. The app, called Transcense, is the brainchild of four graduate students, who have all been affected by hearing loss in different ways. Scroll down for video . The app, called Transcence (pictured) is the brainchild of four graduate students, who have all been affected by hearing loss in different ways. It translates speech into written words that show up on a smartphone, with individuals' speech shown in different colours . They are raising money on crowd funding site Indiegogo to bring their app to market. ‘We developed Transcense to end the professional and social exclusion caused by hearing loss. ‘Transcense brings meaning to the conversation and allows the deaf person to actively engage again,’ they claim. The app translates speech into words that appear on a smartphone in real-time. To do this, it connects to a number of phones and activates their microphones, to accurately capture what people nearby are saying. This diagram shows how the app connects to multiple smartphones and uses their microphones to listen and interpret the conversation, which is shown on themain user's screen . Transcense is the first mobile app that makes group conversations between deaf and hard-of-hearing people and their hearing peers, effortless, the app's creators claim. It shows users who says what around them in real-time, so they can answer in time and be part of the discussion. Transcense connects to smartphones in a room to transcribe a group conversation, such as a business meeting, a family dinner, or a moment with friends. The 'personal interpreter' is affordable, with an annual subscription starting at $150 (£94). The app then uses a voice recognition algorithm to link detect individual voices and link each of them with a colour, which makes it easy for the app’s user to see who is talking on their smartphone screen. A deaf person can also use the app to speak for them using a digital voice, or to get the attention of all the people present, via their smartphones. The graduates, from the University of San Francisco and Berkeley, have so far raised more than a fifth of their $25,000 (£15,707) goal, which they will use to develop the final Android version of their app, as well as an iOS and web version. A one-year subscription to the app is available to pre-order for $150 (£94) and will cost $360 (£226) for non-earlybirds, if the graduates reach their funding goal. The four graduates all have experience of hearing loss, because one of them was born into a deaf family, another is deaf and the other two have learned American Sign Language.","App translates speech into written words that show up on a smartphone .

"George Osborne last night claimed a qualified victory over the European Union as he declared Britain will only have to pay half of its controversial £1.7billion budget surcharge. But the Chancellor faced an immediate backlash from critics who said he was taking credit for a discount that would always have been offered. Mr Osborne said the UK would make two payments next year totalling £850million instead of £1.7billion in a lump sum by December this year. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne yesterday after announcing that Britain will only have to pay half of its controversial £1.7billion EU budget surcharge . The Chancellor said the agreement was ‘far beyond what anyone expected us to achieve’ and a ‘result for Britain’. But the European Commission hit back, claiming it had always intended to apply the complex budget rebate system to the payment, dramatically reducing the bill. Critics accused Mr Osborne of ‘smoke and mirrors’. Treasury officials firmly disputed that account, saying Britain had to ‘work hard’ to ensure the most generous calculation possible using the traditional rebate formula was applied and for the discount to be given in advance, rather than a year in arrears as is usual. The deal struck last night means that Margaret Thatcher’s budget rebate, which she negotiated in 1984, will be applied to the one-off demand for extra payment. The controversial surcharge was landed on Mr Cameron at a Brussels summit last month. EU budget rules allow for member states’ payments to be adjusted based on revisions to assessments of their economic performance. The latest review of the economies of EU member states since 1995 showed Britain had done significantly better than previously thought – triggering the huge bill. David Cameron angrily insisted the UK would pay nothing by the December deadline and called yesterday’s emergency meeting of finance ministers in Brussels for the overall sum to be renegotiated. David Cameron angrily insisted the UK would pay nothing by the December deadline and called the emergency meeting of EU finance ministers . The UK will now pay the smaller sum in two interest-free instalments in July and September 2015. The Chancellor said: ‘We have worked intensively and constructively with the vice president of the Commission and with the other member states and today I can say this: instead of footing the bill, we have halved the bill, we have delayed the bill, we will pay no interest on the bill and if there are mistakes in the bill we will get our money back.’ Kristalina Georgieva, vice president of the European Commission, said: ‘The adjustments for the UK means that UK has to pay more, but also that as a result of this increase, the UK rebate will go up.’ Asked if the rebate had been in doubt, the EC vice-president said: ‘No, absolutely not.’ But Government sources claimed the Commission was seeking to save face and avoid controversy with other member states by suggesting the rebate was always going to be applied. The Prime Minister, attending a meeting of the leaders of Nordic and Baltic states in Helsinki, said: ‘These negotiations have gone well for Britain. The Chancellor has done well.’ Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has called George Osborne's announcement as all 'smoke and mirrors' Challenged that the lower figure was inevitable because of the rebate calculation, Mr Cameron insisted: ‘This was far from inevitable. The bill has been halved, the bill has been delayed, no interest is being paid on the bill and we’ve changed the rules so that this can’t happen again and that is very good news.’ But Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘David Cameron and George Osborne are trying to take the British people for fools. Ministers have failed to get a better deal for the British taxpayer. Not a single penny has been saved for the taxpayer compared to two weeks ago when David Cameron was blustering in Brussels. ‘By counting the rebate Britain was due anyway they are desperately trying to claim that the backdated bill for £1.7billion has somehow been halved. But nobody will fall for this smoke and mirrors.’","George Osborne declares Britain will only pay half of EU budget demand .

In the December 1 derailment, the train was heading into a 30 mph curve at 82 mph. More than 70 people were injured. The NTSB would not comment Friday on the findings. Spokesman Peter Knudson said the charts speak for themselves. The agency has not yet determined a cause for the derailment, but reported earlier that Rockefeller suffered from sleep apnea and said he felt 'dazed' right before the crash. Rockefeller's lawyer, Jeffrey Chartier, said, 'There's more information than these tidbits that have been released and I will comment at the appropriate time.' The speed charts were among dozens of documents involving several accidents that the NTSB released Friday. A report on the condition of the train after the derailment found that blood stained the seats, floors and doors. The cars were littered with dirt, rocks and even tree branches and lost almost all their windows on one side. A New York City police detective who entered one of the damaged cars right after the accident told the NTSB, 'There was people's personal items and there was people laying around. ... There was not one window left on the train.' Four people were killed when the commuter train went off the tracks. Subsequent investigations showed it had been travelling at 84mph to a 30mph curve . Another document listed the crews' cellphone calls and texts and appeared to confirm that the engineer and conductors were not using phones at the time of the crash. In a document relating to an accident in March, a Metro-North engineer told investigators that an electrician who was struck and killed by a train while working on tracks in Manhattan never looked up despite the blast of the train's horn. William Maher said he was coming out of a tunnel when he noticed three workers too close to the track. He said two got out of the way, but one, later identified as James Romansoff, 58, leaned or fell into the train's path. Maher also told investigators that track workers used to stop what they were doing when a train passed, acknowledge the engineer, and go back to work once the train has passed. He said most workers now continue what they are doing without ever looking up. 'To me,' he said. 'That's a little discomforting.' The other two workers on the tracks that night told investigators they were informed the track they were working on was out of service and were surprised when the train switched from another track. --- .","Records show William Rockefeller had sped on four out of six tested runs .

"Mark Jenkins, 45, has been jailed for five years after he took £1.4million from 42 homeowners without finishing the work . A cowboy builder was paid £1.4million by a string of customers but ended up leaving their homes looking like 'bomb sites'. Mark Jenkins, 45, was today jailed for five years after using a number of aliases to target homeowners in Bristol, North Somerset and South Wales between September 2011 and April this year. Bristol Crown Court heard Jenkins, of Caerphilly, South Wales, demanded large sums of money up front and regularly failed to complete work. Jenkins splashed out on expensive Porsche cars and gambling while his victims were left suffering 'immense stress', with some forced to take out loans to resolve half-finished renovations. Police estimate the total loss to victims as around £830,000, though Jenkins, who admitted a charge of fraudulent trading, insists it is in the region of £573,000. A jury heard Jenkins was declared bankrupt and jailed following an identical rogue builder fraud in 2009 - but simply changed his name to avoid detection after serving his sentence. He since took £1.4 million from 42 homeowners in Cardiff, Methyr Tydfil, Clevedon, Weston-super-Mare and Bristol, promising he could deliver their 'dream kitchen or extension'. Judge Graham Hume Jones sentenced Jenkins to five years in prison and told him the most serious part of the offending was the impact caused to victims. He said: 'They tell of saving for years to be able to afford their dream kitchen or the extension to enable an elderly relative to end their life in family surroundings only to be left with what has been described in certain circumstances as a bomb site, with their money from saving gone. 'They tell of immense pressure put on marriages and family relationships and relationships with neighbours. 'These are the most serious factors of this case and there are little or no mitigating factors.' Jenkins, who showed no emotion as the sentence was passed, asked for 22 other offences to be taken into consideration. The judge said Jenkins changed his name from Mark Killick and also used the name Mark Richards to restart the fraud after serving time in prison. His firms, Pro-Fit Builders and XL Builders and Trade Bookers, claimed to secure trade discount and offered competitive prices to draw customers in. He advertised on the RatedPeople.com website, which features recommended tradesmen from across the UK, and people trusted him to be reliable. 'You asked for substantial upfront deposits,' the judge told Jenkins, who spent £62,000 on gambling websites over a three-year period. An example of the quality of work carried out by Jenkins after he left homeowners suffering 'immense stress' Jenkins asked his targets for 'substantial' deposits as high as £20,000 before beginning work on their homes. One homeowner returned to find plastic sheeting and wires poking out from their kitchen tiles . 'The work started and then slowed down or stopped. But your customers were too far in. 'If they pulled out they were frightened they would lose their money and if they paid more they would be paying good money into bad. 'You told them you had a substantial skilled workforce but in fact you were a one man band.' Many of his victims attended court and wept as personal impact statements were read. One woman, from Fishponds, Bristol, who paid a £20,000 deposit for an extension, said: 'Mark Jenkins left me with a shell on the side of my house and he has ruined my life.' Another customer, from Merthyr Tydfil, who gave a £17,000 deposit for an extension said the fraud had brought his marriage 'to the brink of collapse'. 'We are now living with a constant reminder of his deceit and our gullibility,' the victim said. 'He will have a lasting effect upon our family and we will suffer financially for 10 years.' One Cardiff man paid Jenkins an £18,500 deposit to build an annexe at his home for his terminally ill grandmother. 'As my grandmother's health deteriorated I had to constantly say the work was continuing and she knew she was near the end and wanted to spend her final days and weeks at home as she did not want to be in hospital,' he said. 'She died in hospital and her final words were ""When can I come home?""' Avon and Somerset Police and National Trading Standards Scambusters teams spent nine months investigating Jenkins after several customers in Bristol realised they had been conned by the same builder. Speaking after the case, Detective Sergeant Adam Smith described the 'tremendous distress and disappointment' Jenkins' victims suffered. In other cases the fraudster left wiring exposed and did not properly fit plug sockets to the walls as shown . Another plug socket left hanging from the wall after Jenkins was employed to carry out home renovations . Exposed wiring and messy handiwork were hallmarks of the damage caused by Jenkins to the homes of his targets . 'The victims had their dreams and expectations of seeing their homes improved dashed, by the callous actions of a ruthless fraudster, who has been found out,' DS Smith said. Lord Toby Harris, chair of National Trading Standards, said reputable trading websites could be duped by fraudsters posing as legitimate traders. 'Jenkins' deceptive and dishonest tactics left many of his victims financially and emotionally scarred and I am delighted to see that justice has been served,' Lord Harris added. Southwest Scambusters manager, Jonathan Martin, added: 'This successful prosecution, bringing justice for dozens of residents, is thanks to a targeted investigation across a number of authorities over a number of years. 'Mark Jenkins was hooked on his particular kind of building scam and has brought misery and hardship to those he conned.' One of Jenkins' victims, who paid him £42,000 for an extension in Bristol, said she would appeal the sentence. 'The sentence is not high enough,' she said. 'He left us high and dry. It was still a building site. He is very, very good at what he does as a conman.'","Mark Jenkins, 45, has been jailed for five years after targeting homeowners .

"Plenty of people have been driven to distraction by dog mess  - but not many have gone as far as Brighton man Paul Davidson. Fed up with finding poo on the one piece of green space outside his  home, the 58-year-old  finally snapped - and hit on an unusual way to shame the dogs and their owners. Mr Davidson has taken a stand by finding every piece of poo on the green and planting a bright pink flag in each one. Paul Davidson has taken a stand against dog poo outside his house by using bright pink flags to highlight every piece . So far Mr Davidson has planted more than 100 flags, each individually numbered, to show the scale of the problem . So far he has put up more than 100 of his 'poo flags', which he bought from auction website eBay, in an attempt to highlight the dog fouling. He said: 'I started to put out pink flags because I was fed up with people walking their dogs here and leaving their dog's mess behind. 'It's just disgusting. It's about keeping the place clean. We have one bit of grass in a concrete jungle and they are destroying it all.' Mr Davidson, who suffers from kidney disease, said the green is often the only place he can enjoy some fresh air while between dialysis treatments but even this small pleasure was being destroyed by dog poo. Despite his illness, Mr Davidson said he was determined to stand up for what was right by shaming the dogs responsible. Mr Davidson said: 'It's about keeping the place clean. We have one bit of grass in a concrete jungle and they are destroying it all.' Mr Davidson, who suffers from kidney disease, said the green is the only place he gets fresh air between dialysis treatment . Neighbour Charlie Jones said the flags, which shame dog owners who ignore the bins, were 'hilarious' He said: 'It doesn't stop me from standing up for things like this - and I've got good support from the community with people saying 'well done' as they go past.' Mr Davidson, who is now on the committee for the Hampshire Court residents' association, spoke to the dog warden about the problem before he came up with the idea. He added: 'The amount of support I have had is really good. I never expected it to snowball like this.' Neighbour Charlie Jones, 47, said: 'It's the only green space for miles. 'The flags just suddenly appeared - they are hilarious.' And his scheme has even has support from the local authority. A Brighton and Hove City Council spokesman said: 'It is a way of pricking the conscience of dog walkers and getting them to act more responsibly. 'It is very hard to secure prosecutions unless we have witnesses coming forward with a good way of identifying the culprit.'","Paul Davidson, 58, put 100 pink flags in dog poo outside his Brighton home .

"This humble-looking front door is expected to sell for a up to £5,000 at auction - because it once belonged to the house Sir Paul McCartney grew up in. The Beatles icon learned to play the trumpet, piano, guitar and drums at 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton, Liverpool.

"A rise in interest rates is unlikely until next year as it could leave the UK ‘vulnerable to shocks’, the Bank of England signalled yesterday. Bank officials also warned that the UK’s recovering economy was showing ‘signs that the pace of growth was beginning to ease’ as it struggled in the face of a deepening economic crisis in the eurozone. The downbeat comments, published yesterday in the minutes of this month’s meeting of the monetary policy committee, suggested there will be no increase in official borrowing costs until after the General Election in May. Its nine-strong committee voted to leave rates at 0.5 per cent – where they have been since March 2009 – with just two members arguing for an immediate increase to 0.75 per cent. A rise in interest rates is unlikely until next year as it could leave the UK ‘vulnerable to shocks’, the Bank of England signalled yesterday . The prospect of interest rates staying at record lows well into next year will be welcomed by millions of borrowers, but it will be a blow to savers who have lost out since rates were slashed during the recession. Earlier this year it was thought the Bank would sanction the first increase in interest rates since 2007 in either late 2014 or early 2015, but with inflation well below the 2 per cent target at 1.2 per cent many observers now expect them to stay on hold for far longer. The Bank highlighted ‘pessimism about the global economic outlook’ and in particular the single currency bloc, where growth in Germany, the region’s powerhouse economy, ‘appeared to have stalled’. ‘Downside news in the euro area had increased the risks to the durability of the UK expansion,’ the Bank said. ‘Premature tightening in monetary policy [rise in interest rates] might leave the economy vulnerable to shocks.’ Britain is the fastest-growing major economy in the developed world, which grew by 0.9 per cent in the second quarter of this year, and official figures on Friday will reveal how it fared between July and September. However, it is feared they will show that the recovery is slowing as sluggish wage growth, worries about the global economy, and the crisis in the eurozone take their toll. Ben Brettell, senior economist at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘The prospect of recession in the eurozone – our largest export market – poses a severe threat to the UK’s recovery. I can’t see the logic in voting for higher rates at present. I expect them to remain on hold until mid-2015 at the very earliest, and possibly not rise until much later in the year.’ ÷ House-building activity is at its strongest levels since 2007 as the recovery broadens out beyond London to the rest of the UK, the National House Building Council reported yesterday. But it also warned that as work picks up the industry is seeing shortages of skilled tradesmen such as bricklayers, carpenters and decorators.","UK's growth is easing as eurozone is rocked by uncertainty .

"Bold: Sweden's new prime minister Stefan Lofven announced that the country will recognise Palestine as a sovereign state at a conference today . Sweden faced criticism from Jewish groups after announcing that his government will recognize a Palestinian state. The country's incoming prime minister Stefan Lofven made the announcement today as he listed his government's priorities and revealed his new centre-left cabinet. Social Democratic leader Mr Lofven said that Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only be resolved through a two-state solution requiring 'mutual recognition' and a will from both sides to co-exist peacefully. Mr Lofven said: 'Therefore Sweden will recognize the state of Palestine.' He didn't say when or how that would happen. Sweden will join more than 130 other countries that recognise a Palestinian state. Most of the EU's 28 member states have refrained from recognising Palestinian statehood and those that do - such as Hungary, Poland and Slovakia - did so before joining the bloc. The move was met with criticism from a number of Jewish groups, who said that it was 'very sad' that it will recognise the state - despite the disputed nature of its borders. Phil Carmel from the European Jewish Congress which represents Jews in 40 countries including Sweden told Swedish news website The Local: 'This is a token move by Sweden's new government and it is ironic that Sweden recognizes a Palestinian state at a time when even Palestinians can't agree on what its borders will be.' He added: 'A key principle of the European Union is to recognize future states based on negotiations and it is very sad that Sweden appears to have cast these negotiations aside and wants to label Palestine as a state before any formal agreement on its borders.' But Sweden's decision drew praise from Palestinian officials who said that they 'salute' Sweden's position. Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki welcomed Lofven's announcement and called on other European Union countries to follow suit. He said: 'In the name of the Palestinian people and the Palestinian leadership, we thank and salute the Swedish position.' Lofven has built a left-leaning minority government of Social Democrats and Greens after winning Parliamentary elections last month. Announcement: Mr Lofven, pictured second from left, said:hat Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only be resolved through a two-state solution requiring 'mutual recognition' and a will from both sides to co-exist peacefully . Sweden's former center-right government led by Fredrik Reinfeldt did not recognize Palestine as a state, stating that the Palestinian authorities did not have full control over the area. The Palestinians have long sought to establish an independent, sovereign state in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem as its capital, and the Gaza Strip - occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six Day War. In 1988, the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat unilaterally declared a Palestinian state within the pre-June 1967 lines. Battle: The Palestinians have long sought to establish an independent, sovereign state in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem as its capital, and the Gaza Strip - where intense fighting took place in July (pictured) This won recognition from about 100 countries, mainly Arab, Communist and non-aligned states - several of them in Latin America. The U.N. General Assembly approved its recognition of Palestine as a 'non-member observer state' in 2012. It followed a failed bid to join the international body as a full member state in 2011 because of a lack of support in the UN Security Council.","Sweden will join more than 130 other countries that recognise the state .

"A city in Washington State could be set to test its sewage for traces of cannabis in an effort to get a better idea of the amount of the drug used by residents. The author of Washington's recreational marijuana law has suggested that Spokane measure the levels of the cannabis chemical THC in the city's sewers to get a more 'honest' picture of usage. American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Alison Holcomb proposed the idea at a  meeting of the City Council's marijuana policy subcommittee. Cloned marijuana plants are pictured at the Sea of Green Farms growing facility in Seattle, Washington. In July, the first legal recreational marijuana stores opened for business in Washington state, making it the second state in the United States to allow the drug to be bought and consumed in a similar way to alcohol . A scientist for the University of Washington said the proposal is a good idea. 'It's always good for a chuckle, but it does actually work,' Caleb Banta-Green, a researcher at the University of Washington's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute, said yesterday. Mr Banta-Green has tested sewage in Oregon and Washington for the presence of illegal drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine. Ms Holcomb said  that testing sewage for THC provides a more accurate level of trends than self-reporting on surveys, in which people are asked about their drug use. She explained that people often give wrong information when questioned about drug use. 'We can expect to see more honesty' in the sewage, she said. There are many things to be learned from testing for the presence of illegal drugs in sewage, Mr Banta-Green added. Testing the sewage would provide a more accurate picture of the quantities of illegal drugs a community is consuming, he said. And testing over time would provide a picture of what days people are using, he said. A customer sniffs a strain of recreational marijuana at Top Shelf Cannabis, on July 8 in Bellingham, Washington, during the first half-hour of legal sales in the state . Mr Banta-Green's tests in Oregon, for instance, revealed that meth users tend to consume drugs daily, while cocaine users concentrate their use on weekends. In July, the first legal recreational marijuana stores opened for business in Washington state, making it the second state in the United States to allow the drug to be bought and consumed in a similar way to alcohol. Ms Holcomb said state policymakers are very interested in learning whether marijuana use goes up or down as a result of legalization. The City Council subcommittee meeting included representatives of schools, law enforcement agencies, nonprofits and local government to discuss what information needs to be collected as policymakers look to maximize marijuana revenue while ensuring public safety. Testing sewage, which can be frozen for later inspection, would provide only general use figures, not data broken down by age, Holcomb told the subcommittee.","American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Alison Holcomb proposed the idea .

"Entirely built by village locals, this is the incredible Guoliang Tunnel, carved into China's Taihang Mountains. The tunnel, used by foot passengers as well as transport, links Guoliang with the outside world, yet just over forty years ago, things were very different. Before 1972 a path chiselled into the rock used to be the only access linking the village to the rest of the Huixian, Xinxiang, Henan Province of China. The journey was a gruelling, almost vertical set of 720 mountain steps. A mix of tourists and transport use the Guoliang Tunnel as well as admire its craftmanship . The edges have some value of support - a far cry to the dangerous path of forty years ago . The stairs were very dangerous because they were steep, narrow and had no handrails. Then the villagers decided to dig a tunnel through the rocky cliff. Led by Shen Mingxin, head of the village, they sold goats and herbs to buy hammers and steel tools. Thirteen villagers worked on the project and it took them five years to finish the 1,200-metre-long tunnel, which is about five metres high and four metres wide. It was made to be wide enough to be driven along, during which time they used up more than 12 tons of drill rods and 4,000 hammers . Views from the mountain tunnel are spectacular, and are worth the driving risks . The Guoliang Tunnel has become a real tourist attraction known throughout China . The fact that 13 workers developed the passage from start until finish leaves tourists astounded . Goats were sold for tools by the village builders back in the 1970s so as to progress the project . On May 1, 1977, the tunnel was opened to traffic. The wall of the tunnel is uneven and there are more than 30 'windows' of different sizes and shapes. Some windows are round and some are square, and they range from dozens of meters long to standard-window-size. As these pictures show, the tunnel has become a valid tourist attraction in China, detailing the hard work and intuition of the locals who knew advances had to be made to move with times. It is also one of the top ten steepest roads in the world. The tunnel links the village of Guoliang with the rest of the Huixian, Xinxiang, Henan Province of China .

Photos of the road are often misidentified with the Bolivian North Yungas Road, or as it has come to be known, the Road of Death. This South American route has been named by many as the world's most dangerous road, with estimates that 200 people die there every year. The largely single-lane road has no guard rails and cliffs of up to 600 meters (2,000ft). Most of the road is the width of a single vehicle, about 3.2 metres (10ft). During the rainy season from November through March, rain and fog can severely hamper visibility, and water runoff can turn the road into a muddy track, affecting traction. In the summer, rockfalls are common and vehicle dust limits visibility as well.","Road replaced a perilous path that consisted of 720 mountain steps, and started to be built in 1972 .

"The BBC was late to realise it had a shortage of older women on screen, one of its top executives has admitted. Fran Unsworth, deputy director of BBC news and current affairs, said that until recently the corporation believed viewers preferred to see younger women on TV – but insisted it has ‘attempted to address’ the shortage of older female presenters. Miss Unsworth was challenged by the Lords Communications Committee about the lack of older women on screen. Deputy director of BBC news and current affairs Fran Unsworth, who says the corporation has attempted to address the shortage of older female presenters on TV . Crossbench peer Baroness Deech said there is no female equivalent to veteran host David Dimbleby, 76, adding: ‘I haven’t seen a white-haired woman of 76 on television ever ... you only see these model types on television.’ Miss Unsworth said there are not very many older men on our screens either, and claimed Dimbleby, Today programme presenter John Humphrys, 71, and war correspondent John Simpson, 70, are the few exceptions. She also said there are ‘considerable numbers’ of women in their fifties working in television, including journalists Bridget Kendall, 58, and Lyse Doucet, 55. Miss Unsworth also said that there are not many older men on TV either and that David Dimbleby, left, and John Simpson, right, are the few exceptions . But she conceded the BBC had been ‘late to the party’ on the issue of age discrimination, adding: ‘It would be foolish of me to say there wasn’t something in what you’re saying. This a subject we have only woken up to in that respect in the last few years.’ She added: ‘I don’t think it is an audience preference. We’ve only in the last few years taken that on board and attempted to address it. You have to see how the existing generation develop and how they want to develop their careers. ‘If you look at what John Simpson does, there aren’t many people who want to run round Afghanistan in their seventies.’ In 2009, the BBC lost a landmark age-discrimination case against Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly . Figures released last year by Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman suggest women disappear from TV screens as they get older. The findings showed that while 53 per cent of over-50s in the UK are women, the 82 per cent of TV presenters who are over 50 are men.

"Tony Blair’s father Leo died yesterday aged 89. The former prime minister was with his father when he passed away peacefully, his office announced last night. Mr Blair, who pulled out of an engagement with former US President Bill Clinton after his father fell seriously ill on Thursday, said he had been ‘privileged to have him as a Dad’. He added: ‘He was a remarkable man. Raised in a poor part of Glasgow, he worked his way up from nothing, with great ambitions dashed by serious illness on the very brink of their fulfilment. Tony Blair looks dazed as he takes in the second landslide for Labour as he receives the congratulations of wife Cherie and his father Leo. Yesterday, Leo died aged 89 . Tribute: The former Prime Minister, who was with his father when he passed away, said he was 'privileged to have him as a Dad' ‘He lost my mother, whom he adored, when she was still young. Yet despite it all he remained animated by an extraordinary spirit that was in him until the end.’ Mr Blair, who was born in 1923 in Filey, North Yorkshire, was the illegitimate son of two middle-class travelling entertainers - Celia Ridgeway and Charles Parsons. Mrs Ridgeway was the daughter of a wealthy West Sussex landowner. She married at 17 and had two daughters, Jenefee and Pauline, before she became a dancer and started a relationship with Mr Blair's father. The social stigma, combined with the family’s hectic lifestyle, prompted his parents to give up their baby to the Blairs, whom they met while on tour in Glasgow. Clydeside shipyard worker James Blair and his wife Mary - who had suffered two miscarriages and feared they would never have children again - adopted him and quickly became strongly attached to the little boy.

'A remarkable man': Then Prime Minister Tony Blair with his father Leo in Blackpool in 1998 . He adopted the Blair surname and was prevented by Mary from even contacting his biological parents after they eventually married and tried to reclaim him four years later. While he was away on active service in the Second World War, she told his real mother and his half-sisters that he was missing, presumed dead. They accepted her story. It was only after Tony Blair became Labour leader that press articles prompted a reunion which enabled Mr Blair senior to fit the scattered pieces of his life together. Mr Blair grew up in the Govan dockland area of Glasgow and accompanied Mary to left-wing rallies. Leo Blair at his son's General Election count in 1997, with his grandsons Nicky and Euan, in Sedgefield shortly before Tony became Prime Minister . When he left school, he worked as a copy boy for the Communist Party newspaper The Daily Worker. He became the Secretary of the Scottish Young Communist League, between 1938 and 1941, and served in the Army during World War Two. After demobilisation, he studied law in his spare time to become a barrister and later a law lecturer in Adelaide, Australia, and then at Durham University. He seemed to cast off his earlier Communist beliefs and later became a member of the Conservative Party admiring both Margaret Thatcher and Norman Tebbitt. He rose to chairman of the Durham Conservative Association, but his dream of standing for Parliament was scotched by a stroke at the age of 40, when his son Tony was 11. Mr Blair served in the Army in the Second World War, then after demobilisation studied law in his spare time to become a barrister and later a law lecturer in Australia and at Durham University . Blair sent Tony to the prestigious boarding school Fettes College in Edinburgh where he is said to have modelled himself on Mick Jagger. He spent considerable energy grooming his son Tony who, at 12, stood as a Conservative ‘candidate’ in his school’s mock elections. However, tragedy struck for the family when Leo's wife, Hazel - mother to Sir William, Tony and Sarah - died of throat cancer in 1975. Mr Blair remarried and moved to Shrewsbury, Shropshire, with his second wife, Olwyn. By 1995, Tony was leader of the Labour Party and Leo, then chairing the industrial tribunal in Shrewsbury where he now lived, underwent another political conversion at the age of 71. He joined the Labour Party, citing objections to rail privatisation and pride at his son's achievement. However, Leo remained his own man and took out private health insurance for both him and his wife in 1999 - gifting a propaganda coup to the Tory Party. Tony frequently spoke of his closeness to his father, and named his youngest son after him in 2000. Paying tribute to his father, Tony Blair said: 'He was a remarkable man. Raised in a poor part of Glasgow, he worked his way up from nothing, with great ambitions dashed by serious illness on the very brink of their fulfilment' Tony frequently spoke of his closeness to his father, and named his youngest son after him in 2000 .","Mr Blair pulled out of an engagement last night after his father fell ill .

"Now that was a clash. Lateline host Emma Alberici fired up in an interview with an Islamic radical last night, accusing him of failing to answer a single question during a fierce 11 minute segment about the Islamic State terror group. Ms Alberici blasted Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman Wassim Doureihi for failing to answer her questions over whether he would condemn the group's murderous campaign. 'You are clearly obfuscating and I did not invite you on this program to do that,' Ms Alberici said. Scroll down for video . Exasperated: Mr Doureihi faced fierce questioning from the ABC TV host. 'You are clearly obfuscating and I did not invite you on this program to do that': At times, the host and Mr Doureihi talked over the top of each other during the heated 11-minute interview. Hands on the table: The animated discussion centred around the activities of the Islamic State. She asked: 'Why will you not point blank condemn the actions of IS fighters?' Mr Doureihi fired back by branding the question 'offensive'. He said Hizb ut-Tahrir, an Islamic political party which advocates for the establishment of a global caliphate, had previously made their position clear on the terror group. 'My clear position is that we took a clear position on ISIS long before Western politicians wanted to make - wanted to use ISIS as the latest bogeyman'. He insisted that ISIS and al-Qaeda do not exist in a vacuum, and condemned U.S. military action in Iraq. 'They exist as a reaction to Western interference in the Islamic lands and they view themselves, rightfully or wrongfully, irrespective of my opinion or otherwise, as a resistance effort to what they regard as an unjust occupation,' he said. The fiery exchange did not end there. Asked if he was outraged by Australian militant Khaled Sharrouf posting an image of his seven-year-old son dangling a decapitated head, Mr  Doureihi responded: 'Let me tell you what I am outraged by.' A visibily frustrated Ms Alberici replied: 'So you won't even answer the question.' Widely condemned: Earlier this year, convicted Australian militant Khaled Sharrouf posted this image of his son, then seven-years-old, posing with a decapitated head in the Syrian city of Raqqa. Ms Alberici expressed frustration with Mr Doureihi during the interview. Mr Doureihi said the U.S. invasion in Iraq had killed a 'million' Iraqi civillians. EMMA ALBERICI: Are you outraged by - are you outraged by the image of an Australian-born child of seven years old holding up severed heads like trophies in Iraq or Syria?' WASSIM DOUREIHI: Let me tell you what I am outraged by. EMMA ALBERICI: So you won't even answer that question. WASSIM DOUREIHI: Are you going to allow me to answer - are you going to allow me to answer the question? EMMA ALBERICI: What are the Australian public to make of this kind of ... WASSIM DOUREIHI: If you wanted a one-way discussion ... EMMA ALBERICI: No. I think you're the one who wanted the one-way discussion. WASSIM DOUREIHI: If you wanted a one-way discussion, you would not - you did not - you did not necessarily have to invite me. EMMA ALBERICI: I am asking you legitimate questions, ... WASSIM DOUREIHI: You're asking the question, baiting for a particular response. EMMA ALBERICI: ... which you have obviously come here knowing you didn't want to answer. WASSIM DOUREIHI: No, you've come to push a particular view. Because you're not getting the answer you want ... EMMA ALBERICI: No, I've come here to ask you answers so you can ... WASSIM DOUREIHI: Because you're not getting the answer you want. EMMA ALBERICI: I just want - in many cases I just want a yes or no. WASSIM DOUREIHI: Let me make it very clear: you've invited me on to this platform to express my views. EMMA ALBERICI: Yes! WASSIM DOUREIHI: You're not allowing me to do that. EMMA ALBERICI: But you want to express your views quite separate to the questions that I'm putting to you. WASSIM DOUREIHI: I'm answering the question that I deem appropriate. Source: Lateline, courtesy ABC TV . Mr Doureihi said that Ms Alberici was 'baiting' him for a particular response and wanted a 'one-way discussion'. 'It is not Muslims who are flying B-52s,' he argued. 'It is not Muslims who are dropping bombs from their fighter jets. It is not Muslims who are occupying foreign lands!' Ms Alberici pointed out it was Islamic State fighters who were killing Muslims, Christians and children in the Middle East. She questioned why he would not call on young Muslim men not to join the Islamic State. Mr Doureihi said: 'Just because you don't like the answer doesn't mean I'm not answering the question.' Following the interview, Ms Alberici tweeted that it had been an 'extraordinary' exchange. 'I've never, in 20 years of broadcasting had someone not answer a single question,' she said. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, right, said he was changing the law to make it easier to ban organisations such as Hizb ut-Tahrir. War: Australian fighter jets launched their first airstrikes against the Islamic State on Wednesday. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who said earlier this week he was changing the law to make it easier to ban Hizb ut-Tahrir, praised Ms Alberici this morning. 'Good on her for having a go and I think she spoke for her country last night,' he told Fairfax Radio. On Wednesday, Mr Abbott told 2GB broadcaster Alan Jones the group made him 'angry and frustrated'. 'We are changing to law that will make it easier to ban organisations like Hizb ut-Tahrir,' Mr Abbott said. 'But before that even we should have a system in place which red cards these hate preachers and stops them coming to Australia.' Another Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman, Uthman Badar, was embroiled in controversy earlier this year when he planned to give a talk at Sydney's Festival of Dangerous Ideas titled Honour Killings Are Morally Justified. Mr Badar's speech was cancelled after a public outcry.","Lateline host accuses Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman Wassim Doureihi of failing to answer a single question in heated TV clash .

"Is there a secret to buying the perfect engagement ring? Well apparently so, according to one man who has written a how-to buy book for blokes. Londoner, Alastair Smith who currently lives in Bondi, Sydney, was set to pop the question to his now-wife, Faith, but had trouble finding the information he needed to hunt down the best ring. 'I read a book about diamonds on Amazon by a middle aged lady, but it was all about the technical aspects,' he said. Scroll down for video . Alastair Smith (pictured) has written a book 'How to buy and engagement ring' helping blokes with some hints and tips on how to get the best ring . The ring (pictured) Alastair bought for his wife Faith. His difficult six month search for 'the one' prompted him to write a book, 'How to buy an engagement ring' offering tips for blokes. He bought it online and says it was a cheaper option . The secret to buying the right ring. Alastair Smith was at a loss how to get the right ring, until he began a worldwide research project . 'It didn't help me with a budget, whether I should get my other half involved.' So, the 31 year old spent the next six months researching and looking for as many sources of information about engagement rings as he could. Alastair's search began in Sydney, but when he couldn't find what he wanted, he looked elsewhere travelling to other countries on holiday, including New York and London to look into the world of diamonds. 'I still had no luck, they couldn't give me what I was looking for, I needed all the information I could get.' But after six months, his in depth research paid off and he purchased a ring online, pleased he had got what he wanted and paid less than he would have if he bought it in a retail store. 'I got inside info from two jewellers and one gemologist and in the end got an awesome ring for a great price. I nailed it!' he said. Alastair proposed to his wife last Easter and said a number of his friends were also getting engaged at the time and it seemed that no one knew what they were doing. Alastair Smith, 31, (pictured) who lives in Bondi, spent six months looking for as many sources of information about engagement rings as he could find, and compiled his research into a book . Research pays off: Alastair Smith is pictured with wife Faith at their wedding after he bought the right ring after six months of research . 'Some of them spent a fair bit more, got a smaller ring, a lower quality ring.' It's then that his ring hunt adventures sparked an brilliant idea to help other blokes who were thinking about proposing to their girlfriends. Alastair Smith (pictured) at his wedding. He proposed to his now wife Faith after researching how to buy the best engagement ring for six months . The debut author has written a book called 'How to buy an engagement ring' and he says it's an easy to follow guide with hints and tips to help men through the daunting process. 'I wanted to make it easier for other guys going through same thing, millions buy rings every year.' he said. 'Everyone makes the same mistakes, use info to make it easier for people to get a better ring.' He believes the biggest mistakes men can make is limiting their range of rings on offer, encouraging online purchases. 'There's 500,000 diamonds online instead of 50 in stores,' he said. He also recommends playing with the types of the ring and its settings. 'There's really big savings to be made if you know what you're doing.' 'Diamonds are rated by the four C's, sometimes guys get too caught up in the clarity, but you can't really see the difference from the naked eye. 'Guys seem to want purer diamonds, but you can't see it,' he said. The book also provides an insight into understanding what women really want (don't all men), inside info on diamond sourcing and recommended retailers. Recent research has found that one in ten women would turn down a proposal if they didn't like the ring, putting more pressure than ever on men to get it right. Most men take an average of four months to find the perfect ring, so the book has been released just in time for the busiest proposal season of the year - christmas. And he has even thought of everything for guys wanting to buy the book, to help raising suspicion, the book comes with fake covers, or undercover covers to keep their pending proposal under wraps. And if all else fails, and you don't mind breaking the surprise, Alastair says why not ask her what ring she would prefer, because then you know you'll be on the right track. 'If you were going to ask your wife to pick your fantasy football team, would you trust her? That could be the case with an engagement ring.' Sam Lyons (pictured left and right with fiance Kat) used the book 'How to buy and engagement ring' to get the perfect ring . Sam and Kat (pictured) dated for five and a half years before he popped the question. Sam asked his friend Alastair for a sneak peek at his ""how to buy and engagement ring' book for some tips . But if you must surprise the love of your life, he has encouraged blokes to buy a stone on its own and choose the setting once she says yes. 'Still blow her mind with the proposal, some jewellers will mount it on a mock setting, she can then help you choose the setting,' he said. *Look online, buy smarter . 'There's 500,000 diamonds online instead of 50 in stores.' *Play with types of rings and their settings . 'Diamonds are rated by the four C's, sometimes guys get too caught up in the clarity, but you can't really see the difference.' *Understand what women really want . 'Look at her style for hints and tips, matching different ring styles.' * Don't spend outside your means . 'I recommend setting a budget comfortable for you that is a meaningful amount of money.' *Buy just the stone and get it set after she says yes . 'Some jewellers will mount it on a mock setting, she can then help you choose the setting.' 'A lot of blokes don't know a lot of about jewellery at all, so looking at her style for hints and tips, matching different ring styles can also help.' 'It should get their thoughts a lot more streamlined, just giving them the info to get a great ring and save money.' And he recommends, don't spend outside your means. 'It was(price of engagement rings) two months salary, it's now three months according to a Tiffany's campaign (laughs) but I recommend setting a budget comfortable for you,' said Alastair. 'In one years time would you regret what you spent, don't get into debt, it should be a meaningful amount of money.' The 31-year-old's book has also had some success already with his friend Sam Lyons taking on some of the advice, able to get a sneak peek before its release. The 29-year-old had been with his partner Kat for five and half years before he decided to take the plunge into married life. 'It was really helpful, he said. 'When I first started thinking about proposing I kept it to myself, so I asked him to have a peek at an early copy and it gave me a lot of insight into what's involved.' Sam (pictured left) and Kat (pictured right) became engaged five weeks ago. Sam sought advice from his mates' book before buying the ring and popping the question. Sam believes the best advice was outlining how you can go online to play with the variables of purchasing a ring. 'You can go for less clarity and less colour for more of a carat and tweek it to your budget.' 'Had a brief look in shops and was bit blown away by the price, I was totally unaware to look online,' he said. *Average cost of engagement ring . $5300 . *Percentage saved by selecting the right diamond shape . 42% . *Diamonds to choose from my (Alastair's) recommended retailer . 810652 . 'The whole process saved me money.' 'It's an easy read, knowing it is written by a man I can relate to, all info, everything a guy is looking for, think about it in guy terms.' So what did he buy and did the proposal, done overseas in Europe, to his fiance five weeks ago, all go to plan? 'She loved it, a white gold band, round brilliant cut diamond with a halo of diamonds around it,' he said. 'She was happy, she had no idea I was up to it and thought it was really nice.' But Sam says the couple won't be rushing into a wedding just yet. 'Wait a while, we have four weddings before Easter, see those out and travel plans. In about a year,' he said.","Alastair Smith was at a loss when it came to buying the right engagement ring for his girlfriend .

"Weighing 107 kilograms and chowing down on a greasy breakfast, Allirra Braun watched as her grandmother begged for more time to live from her deathbed. At 29-years-old, the Indigenous mother-of-two from Katherine in the Northern Territory, remembers this moment as the day her whole life changed. 'I was with her at the hospital when the doctor told her she was passing away,' Mrs Braun told Daily Mail Australia of her grandmother Sadie Ludwig. 'She had always managed her diabetes, but the doctor was saying ""this is the last of your life, your body won't be able to recover, your organs are shutting down"". Allirra Braun, 29, (pictured finishing Sydney's City2Surf) transformed her life one and a half years ago after losing 32 kilograms . The mother-of-two was inspired by her grandmother Sadie Ludwig, who died of diabetes in January 2013 . 'She begged and bargained with him for her life. She definitely wasn't ready to go and wanted more time in life and it just made me feel so guilty. 'I was throwing my life away and she was begging for hers and I felt extremely embarrassed and shameful. Ten months after her grandmother passed away in January of 2013, the 29-year-old shed more than 30 kilograms from her frame as she forced herself to run from power-pole to power-pole in her tiny town. 'To start off with, I couldn't run one hundred metres – on that same path now, I'm doing 20kms regularly,' Mrs Braun said. 'Back then, I thought that the posts were 200 metre apart so I thought, ""ah yeh, I'll go half way"". Turns out there's only 100 metres between the posts.' Mr Braun, who weighed 107kg at the time, listened to Ms Ludwig beg for more time on her deathbed . Since her grandmother passed away, Mrs Braun has transformed her life . As running became easier, Mrs Braun would walk the 2.6 km to work each day, 'cleaned up' her eating and soon found herself working as a casual group fitness trainer alongside her full time job as a Mission Australia youth worker. She also signed herself up for the Indigenous Marathon Project, set up to 'promote healthy lifestyles to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' and beat almost 120 people for a spot on the 12 person squad. Since running with the group, Mrs Braun says she has realised that running is her 'niche', as she continues to be the first in her team to finish each event, including: a 10km Canberra run, Sydney's City to Surf, a 21km half marathon at the Gold Coast and a 30km event in Alice Springs. 'It feels so good, I've never felt so alive or been this skinny in my entire life. It's important for someone like me to show people that no matter wherever you came from or how big feel, you can train your body to do amazing things,' Mrs Braun said. The Mission Australia youth worker (left) joined the Indigenous Marathon Project, a group that promotes healthy lifestyles to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples . Unable to run for more than 50 metre at a time, she began by training her self to run between the power-poles in her tiny home town of Katherine in the Northern Territory (left). She now runs up to 20km at a time . 'I've got a three-year-old (Lucian) and a 10-year-old (Francis), and that's why I wanted to do it because, being Indigenous, I don't think of myself as an individual – I am my family and then my roots, Gurrindji and Kungurrakan. 'I'm not just stopping myself from being the diabetic hat trick, I'm changing my families lives as well. 'A lot of Indigenous women in Katherine ask me how I lost weight and when I first started running, I was the only Indigenous woman running in town - now they're all walking and pounding the pavement. 'We [Indigenous people] are predisposed for some of the worst chronic illnesses out there and we are so community oriented, we need strong mums – they are the fabric of families and teach the kids – if we go back – we could turn around whole lives.

'Being Indigenous, I don't think of myself as an individual – I am my family ...I'm not just stopping myself from being the diabetic hat trick, I'm changing my families lives as well,' she said . The next stop for Mrs Braun, whose hometown of Katherine only has one set of traffic lights, is the Big Apple where she'll run the New York City Marathon's 42.195km for the first time on Sunday. 'The New York City Marathon will be my first official marathon. I'm confident. I'm a long distance runner for sure, I'm not a sprinter. I have the same pace for 10, 20 and 30 km races so I'll stick to my pace until the end. 'The last 12km will be all mental determination, but I'll keep running for my family and my people – I'll be the first Gurrindji and Kungurrakan to run any marathon.' But when life settles back to normal again, Mrs Braun can't wait to get back to the dusty Katherine track, in the early hours of the morning before her family has woken up for the day. 'Three jobs and two kids, I just love it because it gives me that time for myself,' Mrs Braun laughs.","Allirra Braun weighed 107kg at 29-years-old when her grandmother died of diabetes less than two years ago .

"This huge seventeenth-century barn could be yours for an absolute bargain - as long as you don't mind a bit of DIY. The enormous structure, which is on the the market for only £100,000, has been dubbed the ultimate flat-pack challenge for any Ikea fan. Made from dozens of solid oak beams, it will be delivered to the buyer completely dismantled. But don't worry if you're not handy with a hammer - there's no sign of an Allen key, picture instructions or a Swedish meatball in sight. Instead, each piece of timber has been numbered and an expert in historic buildings will be on hand to help rebuild it. Scroll down for video . This CGI image shows what the barn, which is on sale for a mere £100,000 after 25 years in storage, could look like when it is assembled . The barn will be delivered to the buyer completely dismantled with each solid oak beam numbered to make it easier to put together . The building began life as a thatched tithe barn at Acton Hall, a grand country estate near Stowmarket in Suffolk, before being converted into a house in its own right. There, it stood for 350 years on a country estate until the owners decided they no longer wanted it. Under threat of being sold off in individual chunks, the barn was salvaged by John Langdon, an expert in preserving historic barns, in the early 1990s. It was dismantled and sold to a brewery 25 years ago who planned to turn it into a unique venue for functions but a suitable location for it was never found. It has been in storage ever since until it was recently listed for sale again following a change of heart by the brewery. It has now gone on sale at Summers Place auction house at Billingshurst, West Sussex, with an auction to take place on October 22. And although the barn is currently in pieces, it can easily be reassembled into a structure that is 121ft long, 28ft wide and 25ft tall by a team of experts. But despite a pre-sale estimate of £100,000, it will cost another £100,000 to put it back together and transform it into a grand house, office or function hall. Left, the historic barn before it was dismantled 25 years ago to be sold to a brewery and right, what the timber looks like in storage . Mr Langdon, from Petworth, West Sussex, said: 'The barn dates back to the mid-17th century when it would have been used as a tithe barn to store lots of different things in. 'It was dismantled about 25 years ago on a big farm estate where it was getting in the way of modern farm buildings being built. 'It was going to be sold off as individual timbers so we bought the whole lot, numbered it up, dismantled it and found a new home for it with a brewery. 'It was intended to remain as an open plan building that would be used for functions but the brewery never got round to finding the right site for it. 'In the end they asked us to buy it back from them, which we did. The barn first stood at Acton Hall, a grand country estate near Stowmarket in Suffolk. It was a thatched thithe barn before it was converted into a house. After 350 years, under threat of being sold off in parts, it was salvaged by John Langon, an expert in preserving historic barns, in the early 1990s. It was bought by a brewery 25 years ago to turn into a venue for functions but a location was never found. It has now come out of storage and gone on sale at Summers Place auction house in Billingshurst, West Sussex. 'The barn is made up of many tonnes of beams that we have been storing. 'It's like the ultimate Ikea flatpack, which is exactly how things were made back then. 'The only differences are that we will deliver it to the buyer and they won't need an Allen key to put it up - we will help re-erect it too.

"A  man has been found guilty of sexually assaulting and murdering a 10-month-old baby. Mervyn Kenneth Douglas Bell, 27, was accused of abusing the child and leaving him with burns, broken bones and bruises in March last year near Broome in Western Australia. He was on trial in the WA Supreme Court for more than two weeks, accused of abusing the boy for about 15 hours. Mervyn Kenneth Douglas Bell was found guilty on Friday of sexually assaulting and murdering the 10-month-old boy . Justice John McKechnie, who presided over the trial without a jury, combed through forensic evidence including graphic images of the dead baby before handing down the guilty judgement on Friday. Bell had claimed the child's injuries were caused by multiple factors, including when he fell out of a moving car travelling at about 60km/h, when the boy sat on hot rocks by a river, and when he fell into the water. But Justice McKechnie said Bell's claims the baby had fallen from a car seat were a 'lie' and that rocks had caused his burns was 'unbelievable'. Bell had showed a 'callous disregard for his health and safety', Justice McKechnie said. During the trial, the court heard the cause of death could not be ascertained, but the baby had suffered a broken arm and leg, third-degree burns on parts of his body, and severe bruising on his genitals and anus. Justice McKechnie said it was one of the more 'evil' crimes he had encountered, and the number and nature of the injuries could not have been caused by accident. 'It is not possible for the deceased to have injured himself,' Justice McKechnie said. 'He was not yet able to walk.' Mervyn kenneth Douglas Bell was accused of abusing a 10-month-old baby . The child was left with broken bones, bruises and burns and later died of his injuries . Justice McKechnie said Bell had a motive to harm the child because the baby's mother had humiliated him. 'You had no good reason to take charge of the child,' he said. Justice McKechnie said while Bell had not intended to kill the baby, his overall intention was to threaten the child's life, which meant he was guilty of murder. The child's mother and supporters wept and cheered in court when the verdict was handed down. Bell was remanded in custody for sentencing in December, with Justice McKechnie warning him that he would face a life sentence. The night before he took the baby from Broome, Bell punched and kicked the child's mother and left her on the ground after stripping her naked. The woman was hospitalised but was also charged over an assault on police, the outcome of which is still to be resolved. Outside court, the baby's aunt read a statement on behalf of the family, thanking the detectives in the case but saying the local police should have acted more swiftly when the kidnapping was reported. '(The baby's) beautiful eyes would have searched for his mother,' the aunt read. 'But he was not to know she was under custody in intensive care in Broome Hospital having just been critically bashed by Mervyn Bell and strangely arrested by Broome Police when they attended the assault. 'His eyes would have searched for his beloved Pop who, as soon as he realised he had been taken by Mervyn Bell, frantically sought help from Broome Police to find him and sadly was turned away.' The family said the loss of the baby was an 'unbearable grief' they would have to live with. Comment is being sought from police.

"Phil Simms almost keep his promise not to say Washington's name during their Thursday night matchup against New York but was tripped up late in the game. The Giants legend had announced last month he would not say 'Redskins' and only use 'Washington' during CBS broadcasts, where he's lead analyst calling games with Jim Nantz. He reiterated his decision before the game, but said he wasn't taking a stand against supporters of the current name. Sympathy: Former Giants quarterback and CBS analyst Phil Simms said his decision not to say Washington's name was out of 'sympathy' for those offended . 'It offends a certain group of people and I have sympathy for them,' Simms told MMQB. 'So I can have sympathy for them and I am not denigrating the other side.' Simms danced around the name for most of the matchup, which saw the Giants pick off quarterback Kirk Cousins four times before going on to win 45-14. Still Simms, who played 20 games against Washington as quarterback for New York, reflexively let one slip late in the game as Washington attempted to mount some offense in their losing effort. 'Can the Redskins ... can the Washington offensive line hang in there and block?' The name was also said plenty in the booth by Simms's broadcast partner Jim Nantz, whose response to the controversy was that it's 'not my job to take a stance.' Fans held up anti-Phil Simms fans emblazoned with the slogan 'Keep the Name,' which is also the name of a fan group supporting the Redskins name. Few commentators have decided to drop the name like Simms, alternatively considered a slur and a neutral term for Native Americans. Loss: During the game, 'Skins QB Kirk Cousins threw four interceptions, with three in the third quarter, allowing the Giants to runaway with the game . Legendary: Phil Simms spent 14 years in New York where he played Washington 20 times and led the Giants to 2 Super Bowl wins . Earlier this month, the New York Daily News announced the name would not appear in their articles, and created a symbol using the team's uniform colors to replace the Native American logo. NBC's Tony Dungy, who was the first African-American coach to win a Super Bowl, also said he would drop the name. 'I will personally try not to use Redskins and refer to them as Washington,' he told the Associated Press. In polls, Americans overwhelmingly support keeping the name. Public Policy Polling conducted a December 2013 survey that found 71 percent of Americans wanted Washington to keep the name. The poll also found that support of the name among African Americans was 64 percent and Hispanics only 49 percent. CBS bought the rights to Thursday night games this season with Nantz and Simms working the booth.","The former New York Giants quarterback announced last month he wouldn't use the word .

"The sister of honeymoon murder victim Anni Dewani has told of her regret at not telling her to call the wedding off. Three weeks before Anni married Shrien Dewani, 34, she and her fiancé had an angry row in which she threw her engagement ring back at him, her sister Ami Denborg said. Afterwards she called Mrs Denborg, who lives in Sweden, and told her the relationship was in trouble. 'She called me, I talked a lot to her that evening,' Mrs Denborg told Sky News.  'She was saying a lot of things - ""It's not working well"", and things like that. Scroll down for video . Regrets: Ami Denborg, left, says her sister Anni, 28, right, called her before her 2010 wedding to Shrien, right, . Dewani, 34, of Bristol, previously claimed the couple was kidnapped at gunpoint as they travelled in a taxi . 'I thought she was just stressed out. Looking back, I should have told her ""OK fine, forget it, I'll support you, break this off"". 'Maybe she would have been alive today.' Mrs Dewani, 28, was murdered during her South African honeymoon in November 2010 and businessman Dewani, 34, from Bristol, is to be tried in Cape Town next week for her murder. The millionaire is accused of ordering her killing during their honeymoon in November 2010. His new bride was shot in the neck as the couple travelled in a taxi on the outskirts of the city. Mrs Dewani's father, Vinod Hindocha, 65, said: 'I really hope we get to know what really happened. That's all we are asking for, tell us the truth. 'No father should ever go through what we are going through.' Her mother, Nilam Hindocha, 62, said: 'I was feeling something strange, so I told Vinod ""You must ring Anni today"". Mr Hindocha said: 'She told me in Swedish - so I get the feeling she didn't want him to know what she was talking about. Mrs Denborg and her and Anni's father, Vinod Hindocha, say they hope to discover the truth at Dewani's trial . His wife explained: 'She said ""I have a lot to tell you, and I'll tell you when I'm back in Bristol"".'

Mrs Hindocha added: 'It will be very difficult to hear but we have to be strong, we have to know the truth. 'Every day we remember her, at night we talk about her, we spend hours talking about her.

"John Prescott’s political career came to a humiliating end last night when he lost his bid to be elected as a Police and Crime Commissioner. Voters in Humberside rejected the former deputy prime minister, Labour’s most high-profile candidate, and elected a little-known Tory instead. Lord Prescott was the most significant casualty on a day of political bloodbaths for the three major parties, which saw voter turnout at record lows. Scroll down for video . Faces of defeat: John and Pauline Prescott looked glum as they waited for votes to be counted . Across Britain the public rejected Tory, Labour and Lib Dems to elect a raft of independent candidates. The nationwide turnout of just over 14 per cent was the worst on record in a nationwide poll, as ballot boxes in some polling stations were left empty when not one single voter showed up. In a further blow for the establishment parties, the UK Independence Party recorded some of its best results ever, seizing votes from the Tories and pushing the Lib Dems into fourth place in several seats. Former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott failed in his bid to return to elected office, beaten by Tory Matthew Grove . As counting continued, Lord Prescott was seen emerging from a nearby bar . Lord Prescott led after the first round of votes in Humberside, but when second preferences were taken into account the 74-year-old was overtaken by councillor and Tory candidate Matthew Grove. After his defeat by more than 2,000 votes – on a turnout of just 19 per cent he polled 39,933 to Mr Grove’s 42,164 – Lord Prescott said he did not think he would stand for election again. In a characteristically long, rambling losing speech, he criticised the creation of the post he had hoped to fill, and complained about the cost of the poll. He said: ‘I said at the beginning, this is a Tory marginal seat. It’s not a safe Labour seat. It’s not even a Labour seat. It would have been nice but it wasn’t so. The people have spoken.’ Addressing public disinterest in the elections, he went on: 'They didn't turn out in the numbers that anyone would want. 'We have got a low turnout and I don't think that's an easy thing to live with.' Lord Prescott struggled to hide his disappointment as Matthew Grove addressed the hall at Bridlington Spa . Lord Prescott stood for the election despite having vocally criticised the creation of the new police chief posts. He is now expected to return to the House of Lords. It is his first personal experience of electoral defeat since he stood for Parliament in 1970. If he had won, he would have taken home an estimated £155,000 from taxpayers in salary and pension payouts. The peer gave an indication . of his electoral chances when he told waiting reporters to 'b***** off' earlier on Friday after they asked if he was feeling confident. Tory MP for Clacton, Douglas Carswell, said: ‘The result in Humberside shows that the local voters went for quality rather than quantity. ‘The last thing people want is a failed minister running their local police. They were offered a household name and they would rather have someone who is quietly competent. ‘The days when politics is dominated by so-called big beasts from Westminster is coming to an end.’ Tory winner Matthew Grove paid tribute to Lord Prescott in his acceptance speech . Local businessman Mr Grove, 49, who runs a successful building services firm, has pledged to cut police red tape and sell off the expensive premises used by the Police Authority and use the money for a community crime fighting fund. The result was the silver lining on an otherwise dismal day for the Tories who saw the public react with a mixture of apathy and outright contempt for their flagship law and order policy. Tens of thousands of voters spoiled their ballot papers in an apparent rejection of the new elected police chief roles. At one polling station in Newport, South Wales, not a single vote was cast and ballot boxes were returned empty. The elections watchdog, the Electoral Commission, announced a review of the poll, saying turnout was ‘a concern for everyone who cares about democracy’. Critics said low turnout meant the new police bosses – who will be paid up to £100,000 a year – would struggle to claim a mandate. Lord Prescott was ahead in the first round of counting, but when second preferences were distributed he lost by some 2,000 votes . Lord Prescott is expected to return to the House of Lords, where he sits as a Labour peer . Lib Dem president Tim Farron said it would be ‘extremely difficult’ for PCCs to claim a mandate and warned their legitimacy would be ‘compromised’. Tory backbencher Conor Burns, the MP for Bournemouth, wrote on Twitter: ‘I suspect we will live to regret creating these Police Commissioners. I regret voting for the Bill.’ Aside from Lord Prescott’s defeat, a number of Labour ‘retreads’ and MPs who featured in the expenses debacle were elected to PCC roles. Alun Michael, who was forced to repay almost £20,000 in expenses blaming ‘clerical errors’, was elected in South Wales. Jane Kennedy, who stood down as an MP after complaining about a ban on employing her partner in the Commons, won the Merseyside poll. Vera Baird, the former solicitor general, who put through a £286 expenses claim for festive decorations, won Northumbria. The vote threw up a number of surprise results, including the Tories losing Kent to an independent, the former Police Authority chairman, but winning Dyfed-Powys, expected to be a Labour win. A Labour spokesman pointed to its win in Bedfordshire despite the seat being 24th on its target list. A former judge won in North Wales and seven former police officers were elected. Elected commissioners will set the priorities for policing in their force areas. They will have some control over budgets and, significantly, will hold the power to hire and fire the Chief Constable.","Former Deputy Prime Minister fails in bid for one last big political job .

"Prosecutors made a 'comical series of errors' in a bid to extradite a Mafia fugitive found hiding in a west London suburb, a court heard today. Domenico Rancadore, known as The Professor, is battling Italian authorities as they try to extradite him to Italy to serve a seven-year sentence for his association with the Mafia. He spent two decades living under the name of Marc Skinner with his family in Uxbridge, west London, before he was first arrested in August last year. Domenico Rancadore arrives at Westminster Magistrates' Court today where he is fighting extradition to Italy for his Mafia associations. He spent two decades living under the name of Marc Skinner  in west London . He has previously been described as 'one of the heads of one of the most powerful mafia associations in Italy' and had evaded Italian authorities for 20 years, who accused him of fleeing Italy, where he faced trial over his alleged Cosa Nostra 'man of honour' connections. A first extradition hearing in March failed when Senior District Judge Howard Riddle changed his original decision to extradite him, over concerns that Italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition. But a new arrest warrant issued in April by Italian authorities addressed those issues, prosecutors said at the time. Rancadore's lawyers said that bringing the same case against him twice was an abuse of process. Representing Rancadore, Alun Jones QC also described his client's second arrest, which took place at 9pm on a Friday night, as 'utterly, utterly unnecessary'. John Hardy QC, representing the Italian authorities, told the court that the CPS had made a 'comical series of blunders' in relation to the Sicilian's extradition but argued that they do not amount to an abuse of process and should not stop the extradition going ahead. The mistakes included serving legal papers late to Rancadore's lawyers ahead of an appeal at the High Court and failing to inform counsel that a new assurance had been given by the Italian authorities regarding the prison he would be sent to if extradited. 'It is unfortunate that due to human error the process has not flowed as smoothly as it should have, but we say that to say that there has been an abuse of process is a quantum leap too far,' Mr Hardy said. He had previously been described as 'one of the heads of one of the most powerful mafia associations in Italy' and had evaded Italian authorities for 20 years . Appearing before at Westminster Magistrates' Court in central London, his wife Anne Skinner, known to the court as Mrs Rancadore, said his health was in decline . Appearing before at Westminster Magistrates' Court in central London, his wife Anne Skinner, known to the court as Mrs Rancadore, said his health was in decline. She said: 'It has deteriorated, he trembles a lot and he suffers now from claustrophobia. 'He cannot be inside a lot and has to go out in the garden because he needs open air spaces. 'He is generally very confused in his mind and it is causing stress with everybody in our house, myself and my daughter as well. 'He's mumbling and he accuses me of talking to somebody on the phone when I'm not. Rancadore has previously been described as 'one of the heads of one of the most powerful mafia associations in Italy' 'One time in the middle of the night he woke me up and asked me who I was talking to. 'He has discussed this with the doctor because his mental state is quite worrying for all of us. 'He often seems quite confused and sits quietly with his hands on his head looking into space.' Mrs Rancadore said the family had been 'shocked' by her husband's second arrest, which she said took place in front of an 11-year-old relative. She also said her husband is 'concerned' about what would happen to his family if he were to be sent back to Italy. 'It is not only his health, he is worried about the family because he would be in Italy and we would be here and that has a great influence on his mental state,' she said. Judge Riddle told Rancadore that he was bailing him to appear for another short hearing on October 21, when the court is expected to hear from an expert for the defence on prison conditions in Italy. He said: 'As you know, I have heard legal argument here today and now I have to see if the argument on prison conditions needs time for litigation. 'A report is being prepared on your behalf and should be ready round about October 10. 'I am going to give everyone time to consider it and bail you to return here on October 21 at 10am just for a short hearing to see how far we need to go.'","Domenico Rancadore is wanted in Italy for his Mafia connections .

"Cheered: Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski with Prime Minster David Cameron . A divorced Tory MP and Cabinet aide was cheered and clapped by his local party after telling them he is gay. Daniel Kawczynski received a standing ovation when he told 30 activists from Shrewsbury Conservative Association that he had a male partner. Mr Kawczynski, 41, who was born in Poland, has made history as the first MP to make it known that he is bisexual. Shrewsbury Tory chairman Robert Osborne, who was at the meeting, said last night: ‘It was a very brave thing for Daniel to do and he did it with great aplomb. He received huge support from members of the association and there was never a shadow of doubt that he would. ‘He made the announcement at the end of the meeting and we moved on straight away.’ Well-placed sources very close to the MP say that although he currently has a male partner,  he has not ruled out future relationships with women. The MP feared his decision to ‘come out’ could prompt a hostile reaction from activists in his constituency in rural Shropshire, with many traditionalist and elderly supporters. He was delighted and relieved by the response when he announced at a meeting: ‘I want to tell you that I am with a guy.’ Those attending burst into spontaneous cheering and applause. Some hugged Mr Kawczynski; others praised him for his courage and honesty. He is said to feel a huge weight has been lifted from his shoulders. The Mail on Sunday was told by authoritative sources that Mr Kawczynski has candidly stated he is uncertain over the true nature of his sexuality. The MP, popular and respected at Westminster and in his constituency, has told friends: ‘I don’t know what I am.’ Standing ovation: Mr Kawczynski said he 'feels a weight has been lifted from his shoulders' Until now, he has been best known as the tallest MP in history: at 6ft 8½in, he towers over his colleagues. Last year, David Cameron gave him his first Government post as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Welsh Secretary David Jones. It is the first rung on the parliamentary ladder to ministerial status. He was recently divorced from his wife, Kate, who worked as his office manager. Catholic Mr Kawczynski is a leading member of the Christian-based, Right-wing Tory Cornerstone group, most of whom are sceptical about gay rights and same-sex marriage. The MP agonised before deciding to vote in favour of same-sex marriages earlier this year. In an unexpected and innovative move, he called a public meeting in his constituency before making his mind up on the issue. He was inundated with hundreds of letters from constituents arguing passionately in favour, or against, the measure. In announcing he would vote in favour of same-sex marriages, he gave a profound and moving insight into his soul-searching on gay rights. In an open letter to voters, he said: ‘I understand and fully appreciate that there may be many who do not share in my views. Same Sex Marriage vote: Mr Kawczynski called a public meeting in his constituency before making his mind up . My decision however is one of principle which I have come to after a long period  of reflection – I do not believe same-sex marriage will undermine the union of a man and  a woman.’ Explaining how his faith guided him, he wrote: ‘My convictions as a God-fearing man, and as an individual that believes equality for all, have led me to decide that I will vote in favour of the Same Sex Marriage bill. ‘My faith is essential to everything I do and think. I remember vividly the experiences I had as a child when I was first brought to the church pews:  I learned the basic principles of justice, fairness, equality under the eyes of God, and sacrifice and respect for our fellow man. This is an experience which I am sure most of us shared at the beginning of our Christian lives. ‘When considering voting against same-sex marriage, I realised I could not do so without feeling as if I was at risk of not fulfilling my Christian duties.’ But he continued: ‘Society has come a long way since homosexual acts were illegal and punishable by law. The age of consent for homosexuals is the same as heterosexuals and gay couples can now adopt. ‘I cannot call myself a Conservative and a defender of a principle crucial to our national identity if I vote against allowing all who wish to express their love to another to do so through a legally recognised marriage.’ Last night Mr Kawczynski refused to comment.","Daniel Kawczynski is the first MP to ever make it known that he is bisexual .

"Playing with a toy car's remote control in his doting brother's arms, it is hard to believe that just weeks ago brain tumour patient Ashya King was being treated in intensive care. Though bearing a faint scar on the back of his head from his brain surgery, the five-year-old was almost unrecognisable as the desperately ill child seen being wheeled into hospital on a stretcher in early September. The little boy finished a course of pioneering proton bean therapy last month, and last week was seen with his family in Marbella, Spain, as he continues his recovery. Scroll down for videos . Brothers in arms: Five-year-old Ashya King plays with a toy car's remote control as he is carried by his brother Naveed in the grounds of the Marbella High Care Hospital in Spain . Ashya and his family were seen at the Marbella High Care Hospital in Spain, where he has been treated since leaving the hospital in Prague, Czech Republic, after undergoing proton therapy. He looked intently at the remote as he was carried by older brother Naveed; his mother Naghmeh, 45, and father Brett, 51, not far away as they pushed his younger sister in a buggy. In August, Ashya was at the centre of an international manhunt after his parents took him out of Southampton General Hospital because they believed NHS treatment would have left him deaf, blind and brain damaged. On the mend: The little boy finished a course of pioneering proton bean therapy last month, and last week was seen with his family in Marbella, Spain, as he continues his recovery . At play: Ashya, pictured with his younger sister, plays with the toy car in the back of the family's car . They were traced to Spain where, at the request of the British authorities, they were put in prison and the five-year-old was held in hospital under armed guard with no family members allowed to see him. The Kings had planned to sell a holiday home in southern Spain to fund the pioneering treatment which they desperately wanted their son to have, but which was refused by the NHS in England. However, after a dramatic U-turn in events, they were eventually released from prison without charge and were able to continue their journey to Prague to the Proton Therapy Centre which had agreed to treat Ashya. Family: Ashya's mother Nagmeh (centre), and father Brett (right) pushing his younger sister in a buggy . Worry: His parents have said it was unlikely the family would return to Britain because they do not feel 'safe' enough, and instead took Ashya back to Spain for further treatment . NHS England later reversed its decision and confirmed it had decided to pay for the treatment abroad. After six weeks at the hospital, during which he received 30 rounds of the treatment his parents hope will be life-saving, Ashya left Prague at the end of October. However, his parents said  it was unlikely the family would return to Britain because they do not feel 'safe' enough. Instead, they planned to continue Ashya's treatment in Spain. Speaking after Ashya left hospital in Prague, Mr King told Sky News: 'After some time we decided that perhaps it was best to return to Spain. Desperate: Asyha as he arrived in Prague for his pioneering treatment. He arrived at the hospital by ambulance and was wheeled in on a bed . Recovery: After taking his first tentative steps, Ashya was wheeled out of the centre in Prague ahead of his family's move to Spain. The youngster has spent six weeks receiving pioneering proton therapy treatment . Last treatment: Brett and Naghemeh King with Ashya, prior to his final round of proton beam therapy treatment . We have a property there so life can be established quite easily for us. 'At the moment we don't feel 100 per cent safe, I suppose you would call it, contemplating being in England until perhaps they do this investigation into how everything was conducted for us. 'Once that has been established then we can think about going back to England. But for the time being we have been in contact with a doctor in Spain so we are continuing with (Ashya's) treatment in Spain instead of England.' Happy: Ashya was filmed on an outing to the park in a touching family video posted online by his brother . Medics who had been treating Ashya in Prague said that having arrived at the hospital on a bed by ambulance, by the time he left he was able to sit on his own, and play with toys. The specialist treatment is a more targeted way of destroying cancerous cells than conventional radiation using photon beams, but NHS guidance does not recommend it as the best form of treatment. During Ashya's 30 visits to the centre he had 13 treatments focusing on the brain and spine to ensure the tumour he had removed had not spread, and the remaining 17 to irradiate where the brain tumour once was. He previously had major surgery to remove the brain tumour on July 24 and a further operation on his brain on August 22.

"The parents of a 13-year-old girl who committed suicide last year say her death could have been prevented, if the school had informed them of the reports she was being bullied. On Tuesday, Jason and Jennifer Lambeth hit the Clark County, Nevada School District with a wrongful death lawsuit for the loss of their daughter, Thurman White Middle School seventh-grader Hailee Lambeth. On December 12, Just a few hours after excitedly texting her parents about being named student of the month in her math class, Hailee was found dead in their Henderson home from a self-inflicted gun shot wound. Her 6-year-old brother Jacob made the gruesome discovery. Tragedy: Hailee Lamberth (center) committed suicide last December after suffering months of bulling at school. Her parents Jason (left) and Jennifer Lamebrth (right) have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against her school . Targeted: The Lamberths claim school administrators did not inform them about reports Hailee was being bullied by two students . While the Lamberths were initially shocked by what would lead their soccer-star daughter to kill herself, after reading her suicide note they learned she had been suffering 'severe and abusive acts of bullying'. 'I only ask that you tell my school I killed myself so maybe next time people like (C.H.) wants to call someone (names) he wont,' Hailee wrote in her last letter. Tormented: One student, called 'C.H.' in the lawsuit, allegedly called Hailee 'fat' and 'ugly' They now believe administrators did not do enough to shield their daughter from the students who had been tormenting her from as early as August 2013. Those bullies have since been identified as a male and female student, called 'C.H.' and 'J.J' in the lawsuit respectively. Just three weeks before  Hailee's death a student reported that she was being bullied in a P.E. class by J.J., who made her cry almost every day. The Lamberths claim the gym teacher never filed a report. Another student said in March that she had witnessed C.H. bully Hailee. 'I don't remember the exact date when it happened but I know it happened at lunch around Thanksgiving time, he was pushing her around and he called her ""fat"" and ""ugly,""' the student said. C.H. also reportedly left a letter in Hailee's locker telling her to 'Drink bleach and die' and asking: 'Why don't you die?' Apparently referencing Hailee's recently-diagnosed epilepsy, C.H. even allegedly left a voicemail on her cellphone the September before her death, saying: 'Where are you Hailee? I hope you died.' C.H. had been suspended for three days on two different occasions for bullying other students. The complaint filed  about Hailee getting bullied in gym class was entered on an district website which allows anyone to report bullying anonymously. District policy states that a school administrator must investigate claims within 10 days and report their findings. Avoidable: The Lamberths believe their daughter would be alive today if the school had informed them of the bullying reports. The 13-year-old pictured with her father on the left, and mother on the right . But the Lamberths say they were never told about the report.  In the suit, they point out that under Nevada law, a school principal or other administrator must provide written noticed when there is a reported bullying incident. 'Without a shadow of a doubt, we wouldn’t be here today if the school had informed us of this,' Mr Lamberth told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The school district told the newspaper that they do not comment on pending litigation. • For confidential help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or click here . • For confidential support on suicide matters in the UK, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here .","Seventh-grader Hailee Lamberth committed suicide last December after allegedly being bullied for several months at her Henderson, Nevada school .

"Lord Mayor of London Fiona Woolf is facing calls to step down as the new head of the independent inquiry into child sex abuse . The new chairman of the government inquiry into child sex abuse faced calls to resign last night over her dinner party links to Leon Brittan. Fiona Woolf has now admitted she entertained the former Home Secretary and his wife three times at dinner parties at her house, and twice went to his central London home for dinner. But despite their social contacts she insisted she did not have a ‘close association’ with the peer. Lord Brittan is likely to be called to give evidence to the inquiry about allegations – which he denies – that in his time as Home Secretary in the Eighties he was at the centre of an Establishment cover-up of sex abuse claims. Mrs Woolf, who lives on the same street as the peer, also met his wife for coffee several times, sat on a prize-giving panel with her, and sponsored her £50 for a charity run. Former Home Secretary Lord Brittan is accused of failing to act on a dossier about alleged VIP paedophile rings given to him by MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983. The peer has denied the claims. Mrs Woolf, giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee yesterday, insisted the inquiry would ‘relentlessly uncover the truth for the victims’. But Labour MPs called on her to resign, and victims’ representatives said she was not an appropriate person for the job. Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk, who led the campaign for an inquiry, said Mrs Woolf and Lord Brittan were ‘clearly good friends’ and she should stand down. Mr Danczuk said she seemed ‘out of her depth’ in her appearance before the MPs’ committee yesterday. And he made the extraordinary claim the Home Office may have been trying to ‘protect’ Lord Brittan with the appointment. ‘I have serious concerns about the relationship between Fiona Woolf and Leon Brittan,’ he said. ‘He is surely somebody who has to be investigated as part of the inquiry – not least because of his role as Home Secretary at the time. ‘The public will be concerned they are trying to protect Lord Brittan.’ He added: ‘The vast majority of people I know, if you have somebody round for dinner in your home, you would consider them a good friend. She should not be doing this job.’ Details of Mrs Woolf’s contacts with the Brittans emerged in a letter she sent to Home Secretary Theresa May, published yesterday.She said they lived on the same street since 2004, and invited the couple to a party at her home in January 2008, October 2008 and February 2009. Home Secretary Theresa May is under mounting pressure to sack her second choice to head up the inquiry into historic child abuse . Labour MP Simon Danczuk said it was clear that Fiona Woolf was a 'close friend' of the former Home Secretary Leon Brittan . She also attended dinner parties hosted by Lord Brittan in November 2009 and February 2012. Mrs Woolf told the committee she was given Home Office help in drafting the letter. Labour MP Keith Vaz, the committee chairman, said it was a ‘bit odd’ a draft of the letter was seen by the Home Office before it was sent to Mrs May. ‘Surely you should have written your own letter?’ he asked. Labour MP Paul Flynn pointed out the first choice as inquiry chair, Lady Butler-Sloss, had withdrawn because her brother was Attorney General during some of the period in question. ‘You seem to be an Establishment figure as well. Shouldn’t you resign in the interest of the report being accepted?’ he asked. Labour MP for Bassetlaw John Mann said it was ‘totally impossible’ for Mrs Woolf to chair the inquiry. The Home Secretary's first choice to lead the inquiry into historic child abuse was Baroness Butler-Sloss (left), but she was forced to step down because her brother was the Government's attorney general - in the Cabinet alongside Lord Brittan (right) - at the time some of the alleged abuse occurred . Alison Millar from law firm Leigh Day, who is representing several victims, claimed the inquiry would amount to little more than a ‘reheat’ of past reviews, adding: ‘Yet again we call on the Government to appoint an appropriate person.’ Mrs Woolf was given the full backing of Downing Street and the Home Office. A Number 10 spokesman insisted Mrs Woolf had the Prime Minister’s confidence, and she and the panel would ‘carry out their duties to the high standards of integrity required’. Before MPs Mrs Woolf, a former president of the Law Society and the current Lord Mayor of London, insisted she was not a member of the Establishment and was an ‘ordinary solicitor’. She said Lord Brittan was ‘one of thousands’ of people she knew in London. Lord Brittan is accused of burying a dossier given to him by MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983. It documented the alleged involvement of VIP figures in a child sex ring. He has denied the claims. These are the unanswered questions: .","Fiona Woolf  lives on the same street as the ex Cabinet Minister Leon Brittan .

"The Co-op was plunged into fresh chaos yesterday as its chairman fell on his sword for appointing crack addict Reverend Paul Flowers to head the group’s bank. Len Wardle’s resignation came as anger is growing among ordinary investors whose retirement incomes are being raided to prop up the disaster-prone bank. He admitted ‘serious questions’ were raised by the drugs scandal over former banking chairman Paul Flowers. Cooperative Group chairman Len Wardle has resigned with immediate effect after questions were raised about how Paul Flowers, who has been caught buying crystal meth and cocaine, was put in charge of its bank . Mr Flowers, a former Labour councillor and Methodist minister who . was chairman of the Co-operative Bank when it ran into trouble, faces an investigation by the police after being covertly filmed . counting off £20 notes to buy hard drugs. He was covertly filmed buying crystal meth and crack cocaine. It also emerged today it emerged he has a conviction for gross indecency and quit as a councillor for having pornography on his computer. The Co-operative Group yesterday launched a fact-finding investigation into . 'any inappropriate behaviour' at the group or the Co-operative Bank and a . 'root-and-branch review' of the structure of the organisation. Ed Balls has come under pressure to return a £50,000 donation backed by the former Co-operative Bank chairman hit by claims of hard drug use. Labour's leadership has attempted to distance itself from Paul Flowers, a former councillor, after it emerged he attended a private meeting with Ed Miliband and both men were also present at two dinners in Westminster. Sources insisted he was 'neither influential nor important'. Yesterday the 63-year-old was suspended from the party for bringing it into disrepute following footage that appears to show him buying drugs days after being grilled by the Treasury Select Committee over the bank's disastrous performance. A Labour source: 'It's true that there was a private meeting with Ed in March of this year. There were two informal dinners - three meetings that we can find records of in the space of three years. Earlier this month Mr Flowers told the Commons Treasury committee said: 'My recollection is that we paid for a particular researcher to assist the shadow chancellor in the work that he needed to do, and that we believed to be a legitimate and proper use of resources.' Tory MP Brooks Newmark told the Daily Telegraph: 'The Rev Flowers' judgment was clearly impaired if he was prepared to give Ed Balls £50,000. 'Mr Balls should now ask himself whether it is right to accept that money, and consider giving it back.' There is growing incredulity that a man with no banking experience and a penchant for crystal meth and cocaine had been made chairman of a bank. But today Mr Wardle announced he will quit the £145,000 position he has held since 2007. He was due to leave next May but he said it was now right for him to go straight away, having led the board that appointed Mr Flowers. Mr Wardle said: ‘The recent . revelations about the behaviour of Paul Flowers, the former chair of the . Co-operative Bank, have raised a number of serious questions for both . the bank and the group. ‘I . led the board that appointed Paul Flowers to lead the bank board and . under those circumstances I feel that it is right that I step down now, . ahead of my planned retirement in May next year. ‘I . have already made it clear that I believe the time is right for real . change in our operations and our governance and the board recently . started a detailed review of our democracy. ‘I . hope that the group now takes the chance to put in place a new . democratic structure so we can modernise in the interests of all our . members.’ Critics have . questioned how he could have been appointed given his apparent lack of . experience, and Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, . said that, even before the weekend’s revelations, it was clear he was . ‘manifestly unsuitable’. The Co-operative Bank is facing a . rescue plan which will see majority control turned over to investors . including US hedge funds, after it was left with a £1.5 billion gap in . its finances following the takeover of the Britannia Building Society in . 2009. Mr Flowers, a former . Bradford councillor, now faces a police investigation. He has apologised . over the scandal and been suspended by the Methodist Church as well as . the Labour Party. Mr Wardle’s departure will see him replaced by his deputy, Ursula Lidbetter, chief executive of the Lincolnshire Co-operative. The . Co-operative Group said: ‘It is intended that Ursula will chair the . group through the current governance review, which will include . consideration of how the board is constituted and chaired.’ MPs have castigated financial watchdogs for . rubber-stamping the appointment of Rev Paul Flowers, which they . denounced as a farcical ‘box-ticking exercise’. Caught on camera: The Rev Paul Flowers was filmed counting money for a drugs deal . Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Commons . Treasury Select Committee, said it was obvious when Flowers appeared . before them earlier this month that he was ‘manifestly unsuitable’ to be . a bank chairman. He called for the regulation of senior bankers to be tightened to include continuing and ‘intrusive’ supervision. ‘It’s been a complete disaster. Nothing less than saying that will do,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s World At One. He . attacked the ‘approved persons regime’, whereby a City panel supposedly . checked the competence of Rev Flowers, as ‘nothing more than a massive . bureaucratic, back-covering, box-ticking exercise that satisfied . regulators but did little or nothing to protect shareholders or . customers of banks’. Ursula Lidbetter replaces Mr Wardle in running the troubled Co-op Group . In fact Flowers was only . checked by the regulator when he became a member of the Co-op board and . was not re-interviewed at all when he was promoted to chairman in April . 2010. Flowers quit his . post in June this year as his ‘ethical’ bank was driven to the brink of . collapse, threatening the retirement incomes of thousands of pensioners. Yesterday he was also suspended by the Labour Party amid embarrassment over a £50,000 donation to Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls. He . faces a police inquiry into his use of hard drugs, and the Co-op . announced a ‘root and branch review’ into ‘any inappropriate behaviour’ during the tenure of its former boss. Mr Wardle will be replaced by his deputy, Ursula Lidbetter, chief executive of the Lincolnshire Co-operative. She told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: 'The stories (about Mr Flowers) are shocking but it's not something that I can comment on today. There are investigations going on, it is in the hands of police. 'Len had already told the membership that he was going to stand down next May and in light of the review of governance, which Len started, he felt that making a fresh start with a new chairman would be the best way forward. 'We have to devise a governance for the Co-operative Group which is fit for the future, for the scale and complexity of the organisation. It's an amalgamation of many, many organisations over its 150-year history, and we realise that it needs to change, it needs to be simpler, and that will mean changing many things. The one thing we do want to make sure is that members still have a voice at the heart of the Co-operative Group. There are seven million members and we think their voice should be heard loud and clear, but we are open-minded about how we achieve that. 'The review will look at absolutely everything - it will look at what went wrong, it will look at the opportunities and we will devise a governance structure that is fit for the future, involves our members and makes sure we are very efficient and highly effective in the future.' Raid: Police have searched the home of Reverend Paul Flowers after he was filmed apparently buying hard drugs . The sordid past of disgraced Co-op . bank boss Reverend Paul Flowers was laid bare today after it emerged he . has a conviction for gross indecency and quit as a councillor for having . pornography on his computer. The fallen Methodist minister is already . being investigated by the police after apparently buying hard drugs, . including crack cocaine and crystal meth. But it has now been revealed that in the past 30 years he has been involved in a series of sex scandals. In . 1981 he was convicted of gross indecency after he was caught by police . performing a sex act with a trucker in a public toilet - but he was . forgiven by the church. Rev . Flowers, who is gay, admitted the offence at Fareham Magistrates' Court . in Hampshire and was fined £75 with £35 legal costs, yet his church let . him continue in his job because he was sorry. He . also resigned as a Labour councillor in Bradford in 2011 after . 'inappropriate but not illegal adult content' was found on a computer he . used, the city council said today. A . rent boy claimed today that the Methodist also used his Co-op email . account to organise drug-fuelled sex sessions with and others while he . was still chairman of the bank. After . his gross indecency conviction, Flowers told magistrates he was 'shamed . and embarrassed' about the incident, but maintained he was involved 'at . the other man's . instigation'. Yet he was allowed to continue as a Methodist minister. 'This . was a matter for our usual procedures and after that process was . complete it was decided he could continue as a minister,' a Methodist . Ministry spokesman said. 'This matter did not preclude him from his activities in the church. He was very contrite, and he continued his work.' A spokesman for Bradford Council said: 'Paul Flowers left Bradford Council in September 2011. 'Inappropriate but not illegal adult content was found on a Council computer handed in by Councillor Flowers for servicing. This was put to him and he resigned immediately.'","Len Wardle resigns as Co-Op Group chairman with immediate effect .

"Once the grandest ocean liner in the world, RMS Queen Mary is now a luxury Long Beach hotel in California, United States. And now, as it celebrates the 80th anniversary of its first sail, the history of the great vessel and stories throughout the centuries were on show as the ship opened its doors for a day's free admission. The Queen Mary was built by John Brown & Company in Clydebank, Scotland, launched in 1934 on the River Clyde for the Cunard Line, and set on its maiden voyage in 1936 from Southampton to New York. Scroll down for video . Setting: The magnificent RMS Queen Mary is now a luxury hotel in California . Remembering its roots: The ship still retains very much a British feel . Explore: To celebrate the 80th anniversary of its launch, the Queen Mary allowed visitors in for free . For the next few years it was used as a luxurious civilian carrier, carrying Hollywood celebrities like Bob Hope and Clark Gable, royalty like the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, and dignitaries like Winston Churchill. The Queen Mary was 1,019.5 feet long and weighed 81,237 gross tons. It had a cruising speed of 28.5 knots (about 33 mph). Construction began in 1930 in Clydebank, Scotland, and the Queen Mary was destined to stand in a class all her own. Rumoured the directors of the process, Cunard, had originally decided to call the ship RMS Victoria, however on proposing the name to King George V, Queen Mary was decided upon. On May 27, 1936, the Queen Mary departed from Southampton, England embarking on her maiden voyage to New York. She boasted five dining areas and lounges, two cocktail bars and swimming pools, a grand ballroom, a squash court and even a small hospital. Was a luxury ocean liner for three years until 1939, when it was transformed into a troopship for the Second World War. Resumed it's passenger service in 1947, where it continued until 1967, when it docked permanently in California. During this time she even set a new speed record, which she held for 14 years. But when the Queen Mary docked in New York in September 1939 that would be the last time she would carry civilian passengers for many years. Alongside Normandie and Queen Mary's running mate the Queen Elizabeth, the trio were transformed into troopships during the Second World War. Known as the 'Grey Ghost' during the War, as she was painted a camouflaged grey color and stripped of her luxurious amenities, the Queen Mary was the largest and fastest troopship to sail, capable of transporting as many as 16,000 troops at 30 knots. Following the end of World War Two, the Queen Mary underwent a 10-month restoration process to restore her to her previous luxury, and on July 21, 1947, resumed regular passenger service across the Atlantic Ocean, and continued to do so for nearly two more decades. The ship remained a top ocean liner up until the 1960s when air travel became more popular than sailing, and in 1967 the ageing vessel was retired to Long Beach and turned into a hotel and an events venue. The ship is home to three world-class restaurants and is an icon in Southern California. To celebrate the anniversary, a 15-foot long 600lb cake was made replicating the vessel, with Long Beach mayor Robert Garcia conducting the ceremonial cutting. Onward: The ship, pictured here in the River Clyde where it was launched, was a vessel of class and luxury . Incoming: The Queen Mary entering Southampton after her speedy voyage from Clydebank in Scotland . All aboard: Masses of people gathered for the maiden voyage of the Queen Mary as it set sail from Southampton to New York back in 1936 . After some speeches and a short film, guests were able to sample a slice of cake from, made by baker Jose Barajas. As well as visiting the giant engine room on board, guests were treated to entertainment from song and dance group the Satin Dollz. In attendance was June Allen, who sailed on the Queen Mary from her home in England to New York City after the Second WorId War with a group of English war brides who married American Generals. For Allen, as well as all those who assembled on board, it was a perfect chance to remember the history of the great ship, as well as share memories of the past.

"Obese people will be paid to lose weight through schemes in the workplace, under radical plans unveiled today. Under the NHS-backed scheme, slimmers would be given rewards such as cash or shopping vouchers. Employers will also be urged to offer incentives to staff who shed pounds. Firms will be given some funding to set up slimming or exercise classes and also receive tax breaks from the Government. Critics argue that obese people should take responsibility for their own health. But Dr Sally Norton, an NHS consultant specialising in weight loss, says our busy lifestyles and constant temptation to eat fatty foods means this is simply unrealistic. Dr Norton - who works at Bristol Royal Infirmary and Southmead Hospital - argues we should give overweight people as much help as possible, to try and halt the obesity crisis. Here, she gives her view... Dr Sally Norton says our busy lifestyles and constant temptation to eat fatty foods means many people simply can't manage their weight . I am getting more and more cross. Every time I discuss weight loss and health issues, someone will say, in a rather accusatory tone, 'surely it is down to the individual to take responsibility for their own weight and well-being'. Perhaps, in an ideal world - but this is the real world and we need to face facts. How can we be stuck in a sedentary job, eating poor quality food, hunched over a computer, under stress from 9-5, five days a week, and expect to have the time or energy to work on our weight, health and fitness in the remaining hours? As an NHS weight loss surgeon, the person in front of me is seeking help. Should my response then be: 'Well, of course you do understand I can't help you - it was your personal choice, your weak will, your lack of ability to resist temptation. 'And now you are going to die early from a weight related disease. 'Oh, and by the way, there's a Caramel Latte for you as you leave the premises - in one of the many coffee shops springing up in hospitals - to help with the shock?' Of course not – because I don't believe that is true. Instead, I will provide weight loss surgery, where appropriate. But I think we should be insisting that employers, manufactures, retail outlets, governments and especially our hospitals are doing all they can to help us keep weight off in a healthy way. Two thirds of us are overweight or obese and we are making sure that our kids are following in our footsteps. The bottom line is, that however much we want to eat more healthily and take more exercise, we are surrounded by temptation wherever we turn. Portions are getting bigger and bigger. Manufacturers are busy dreaming up increasingly calorie-packed offerings that they market to us with well-researched psychological manipulation. We seem busier than ever, but in a sedentary way. We are often trapped in offices with limited opportunity for activity, and everything is geared towards convenience: drive-throughs, escalators, home deliveries, gadgets to reduce physical effort. So, yes, personal responsibility is important - but we need help. It is blindingly obvious that we can't beat this on our own. She argues many us are 'trapped in offices with limited opportunity for activity, and everything is geared towards convenience' - including fast food and moving as little as possible . We need manufacturers to do their bit by providing us with easy access to healthier food choices. We don't need tricks such as coercing us into buying double sized chocolate bars that we all know won't be shared - but instead will change our perception of a normal serving. We also need to make health and well-being part of our daily lives, and that, for many of us, involves the workplace. Simon Stevens has today suggested that companies should be encouraged to help us tackle our weight and health. Sugar-laden drinks are contributing to obesity . Dr Norton recently spoke out about the rise of coffee outlets in hospitals and says she no longer shakes the hands of her patients - more often than not because they arrive clutching a Costa take-out. In the place of these popular coffee shops and fast food outlets, she has called for restaurants and cafes championing local food producers and offering healthy and tasty snacks. 'We read every week, in The BMJ and other leading medical journals, of research detailing the perils of sugar and fizzy drinks,' she said. 'We frequently hear laments about the cost to the NHS of the epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes, which is threatening to engulf us. 'And yet, the NHS, which I understood to be an organisation that promotes and supports health (rather than just treating disease), is actually contributing to the problem. 'As a weight loss surgeon, I find it frustrating and, frankly, embarrassing to spend time in clinic, explaining to my patients how sugary drinks and snacks are one of the biggest drivers of obesity, when I know that just outside in our hospital foyer are not one, but two Costa coffee shops, as well as vending machines stocked full of coke and chocolate.' This has provoked all sorts of derisory comments about how we would be affronted to have our employers forcing us on to the scales every Monday for an office weigh-in. Of course, there are good and bad ways to do this, but the crux is that many of us spend a vast proportion of our lives at work. So if our work environment doesn't encourage us to be healthy then we just don't stand a chance. Simon Stevens says the NHS is in financial crisis - but can we expect individuals to take responsibility for their health? Well it hasn't worked so far. Simon Stevens is right. If we don't challenge the causes of illness then the NHS is at risk of becoming bankrupt. When providing a cure is financially not viable any more then the only choice is to identify the cause of the imbalance and tackle it at the roots. It was never enough to look for a cure for cancer – it was always the aim to stop smoking through education; through warning on packaging; through removing temptation. How is it any different for obesity? Simon Stevens is asking government to get involved – to offer corporate rewards for health in the workplace - and I agree. Let's make the most of this opportunity to improve our health, weight and well-being at our employer's expense – and we may even find work more enjoyable as a result. Any employer shuddering at the thought of introducing this initiative can take note of the boom in workplace wellness programmes in the U.S., where companies have seen the benefit of caring for their staff. UK employers lose over £20 billion a year due to absenteeism, but the costs of presenteeism - reduced productivity at work due to ill-health or poor fitness - may be three times higher. Being overweight or obese increases the number of sickness days taken by 50 per cent. This equates to around  £14 billion a year in lost revenue and may increase presenteeism rates 15-fold. As doctors, we need to give you the holistic care you expect to help you lead a longer, happier life but, at the same time, we must try to preserve the NHS from bankruptcy.","Dr Sally Norton is an NHS consultant specialising in weight loss .

"The BBC has been accused of using a tax breaks scheme to increase its public funding. Yesterday it emerged the corporation has set up artificial companies to attract tax credits, prompting claims that it is behaving in a similar manner to huge private firms such as Google, Starbucks and Amazon. The broadcaster has already saved more than £500,000 according to reports, with a share of up to £265million over five years available. The BBC has been accused of behaving like tax dodgers 'Google, Starbucks and Amazon' by using a multimillion-pound tax break scheme to increase its income . It has taken advantage of a decision by George Osborne in 2012 to allow cuts in corporation tax to high-cost British-made dramas, comedies and animation, in an attempt to increase filmmaking in the UK. Independently-produced programmes, or those made by BBC Worldwide, which is the BBC’s commercial arm, would be eligible for the cuts, the Chancellor indicated. But BBC shows produced in-house for public-service channels could not be claimed for, because the BBC is non-profit making and therefore does not pay corporation tax. The BBC then created a commercial subsidiary for drama – Grafton House Productions – and a subsidiary for comedy – BBC Comedy Productions. It is through Grafton House that £520,133 has been reclaimed as nominal corporation tax for two dramas: The Interceptor and One Child. The BBC could receive more, as there is a total budget of £205million for tax relief to drama, and a further £60million for animations. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, criticised the move. She told the Sunday Times: ‘It is wrong for the BBC to deliberately set up an artificial structure to get taxpayers’ money as it is for Google, Starbucks and Amazon and they should stop it. 'I believe in the publicly funded service but they have got to behave properly.' The BBC said the government is aware of this approach and has voiced no objections. But Hodge's attack is likely to embarrass Lord Hall, the director-general, who has attempted to clampdown on the internal BBC gravy train. The BBC does not pay corporation tax, as it is non-profit-making. Osborne announced in his 2012 budget that the cuts in corporation tax would apply to high-cost dramas, comedies and animations made in Britain. The creative industry tax reliefs work by increasing the amount of allowable expenditure, so when the company makes a loss, it is able to 'surrender' the loss. From April to December last year the high-end TV tax relief supported more than £233 million of investment in high-end UK-produced television. Osborne said programmes aired on the BBC's networks could be eligible if they were made by independent producers or the corporation's commercial arm, BBC Worldwide. But the BBC could not claim the money for shows produced in-house for public-service channels, because this would breach European rules on state aid. The European Commission's letter to Hague said the scheme giving tax relief to drama had a total budget of £205million for the five-year period to April 2018, while a further £60million was available for animations. The BBC said: 'The BBC is committed to investing as much money as possible into the shows audiences love and by applying for tax credits, we can invest even more money into our programmes. 'This in turn delivers wider economic and cultural benefits by ensuring productions are shot in the UK rather than abroad. It also allows the BBC to compete on an equal footing with independent productions, including those commissioned by the BBC, that use the tax credit. 'The UK tax credits are available to all productions which satisfy the clear, objective criteria set out in the relevant legislation. Having taken the appropriate legal, tax and regulatory advice, the BBC considers that it is best able to deliver the benefits associated with the UK tax credit via commercial subsidiaries. The government is aware of this approach and has voiced no objection.' George Osborne offered tax breaks to attract high end TV productions, dubbed the Downton Abbey Tax, to build on the global success of the ITV period drama. From April to December last year the high-end TV tax relief supported more than £233 million of investment in high-end UK-produced TV between April and December 2013. Osborne said BBC's networks could be eligible if they were made by independent producers or the corporation's commercial arm. So the BBC set up Grafton House Productions and Comedy Productions to secure a rebate of up to 20 per cent on high-profile shows. It works by  increasing the amount of allowable expenditure, so when the company makes a loss, it is able to 'surrender' the loss.","Chairman of  public accounts committee said BBC was behaving improperly .

"These incredible aerial photos show the lava flow currently inching closer and closer to the small Hawaiian village of Pahoa. The pictures were taken on the same day that 83 National Guardsman were dispatched to the area to aide in the evacuation of homes threatened by the hot molten rock. Pahoa has been waiting for the flow to cut the main road in half since June, when an eruption by the active Kilauea volcano sent lava on course for their town. This aerial photo shows a lava flow approaching the main road of the town of Pahoa on Hawaii's big island. On Thursday, a contingent of National Guardsmen was dispatched to the area to aide in the evacuation . The lava flow is set to cut the town in two, when it eventually makes its way across the main road. After that happens, most of the town will be cut off from the grocery store, which will be located on the other side of the flow . The arrival of National Guardsmen was met with relief by many locals who have expressed concern that their homes could be targeted by looters . The lava flow stems from a June eruption of the Kilauea active volcano. The lava surfaced from a vent on the volcano and may reach all the way to the sea . The lava flow from the Kilauea volcano was at last watch advancing at less than five miles an hour, said Darryl Oliveira, director of Hawaii County Civil Defense . This October 30, 2014 photo from the U.S. Geological Survey shows a breakout of lava oozing from the margin of the lava flow near the town of Pahoa . The lava flow has broken through a fence surrounding a wooded area and has spilled out onto a field . Trees have also been uprooted as the flow from the Kilauea volcano continues to advance across the area . The contingent of National Guard troops was dispatched to Pahoa on Thursday to provide security to the Big Island community threatened by a river of molten lava that is slowly creeping toward the town's main road, an emergency official said. The lava flow from the Kilauea volcano was at last watch advancing at less than five miles an hour, said Darryl Oliveira, director of Hawaii County Civil Defense. Some residents have expressed concern about potential looters targeting evacuated homes. HVO geologists walk over the surface of the flow to track surface breakouts along a portion of the flow margin of the  Kilauea Volcano lava flow that threatens Coastal Village, in Pahoa, Hawaii . This Wednesday, October 29, 2014 photo provided by the U.S. Geological Survey shows an aerial view of the lava flow over Cemetery Road and Apa'a Street near the town of Pahoa on the Big Island of Hawaii. Rain fell Wednesday on a red-hot river of lava as it threatened to consume its first home on its slow advance into a rural Hawaii town . ""These are local troops, people from the community. They'll be here working to take care of their family and friends,"" Oliveira told a news conference. The lava threatens to destroy homes and cut off a road and a highway through Pahoa, but officials have not offered any predictions on when exactly it could bisect the town of about 800 residents at the site of an old sugar plantation. No homes have been destroyed so far, and a finger of lava that threatens one house on the edge of town has not advanced closer to the evacuated structure since Wednesday night, Oliveira said. The lava remained about 100 feet from the home, he said. Meanwhile, the glowing leading edge of the lava flow is now about 160 yards from Pahoa Village Road, the main street through the town of almost 1,000, officials said in a statement. Residents of about 50 dwellings in what civil defense officials called a ""corridor of risk"" have been asked to be ready to leave, and many have been slowly emptying their homes of furniture and treasured possessions. Lava from a vent at Kilauea volcano, one of the earth's most active, has been sliding northeast toward the ocean since an eruption on June 27. Locals say the molten rock is being spread by Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess. 'She is so gentle, but so unrelenting. She is just slow and steady,' said Jamila Dandini, a retiree who stopped at a coffee shop down the road from where scientists have forecast the lava will likely cross. Last month, scientists said it was two weeks away from hitting the main road in Pahoa. The lava slowed but has largely remained on course. Molten trail: Lava spouting from hot spot from Mt. Kilauea is inching closer to the village of Pahoa, which has around 950 residents . Hawaii County civil defense officials said it was about 225 yards away from Pahoa Village Road yesterday evening, traveling about five to 10 yards an hour. The slow pace has given residents time to pack their valuables and get out of the way. But it has been agonizing for those wondering whether the lava might change directions and head for them - and stressful for those trying to figure out how they will cope once the lava blocks the only roads in and out of town. Once the lava crosses the road and the bypass road, effectively slicing Pahoa in half, most residents won't be able to get to the area's only supermarket even though it's only a mile from the town center. The rural, mostly agricultural community of Puna, for which Pahoa is its commercial center, will be cut off even more if the lava makes it all the way to the ocean, some six miles away. Some businesses are closing or moving. Some are vowing to stay. Ms Dandini likened the impending isolation to being on 'an island on an island.' She predicted it would be an opportunity for people to work together to solve their problems. Construction crews prepare Pahoa Village Road as lava flow from Mt Kilauea approaches. 'It's like slow torture,' said Paul Utes, who owns a cafe in the town . The lava has been moving at varying speeds for four months. Observations determined it was 510 meters from Pahoa Village Road . Paul Utes, who owns the Black Rock Cafe, said: 'It's like slow torture. It speeds up, it slows down. It speeds up, it slows down. 'It's not like any other event where it comes and goes and it gets over with and you can move on.' Mr Utes' restaurant is not in the predicted path even though it's just a few hundred yards south from where the lava will likely cross the main road. But he worries this could change. Even if the cafe is spared, he doesn't know how traffic will be diverted once lava crosses the road, how his vendors will supply his restaurant and what the public — his customers — will do. Lava pushes through a fence marking a property boundary above the town of Pahoa on the Big Island of Hawaii . Construction crews battle to divert the lava, which has already destroyed a building on a residential farm property . For the time being, business is up because more people from around the island and tourists from outside Hawaii have been streaming into town hoping to get a glimpse of the molten rock. 'The anxiety building up is kind of hard to deal with,' he said. Some changes brought by lava are already starting to have an effect. The county bus no longer passes through the main street lined with wood buildings dating to the town's heyday as a lumber and sugar-plantation town. So Ms Dandini has to walk into town from where the bus drops her off on the outskirts. Some people, she said, have been discussing pooling their resources for supply runs to Hilo, the nearest city, because it could take hours to get there on alternate routes once Pahoa's main roads are cut off. So far, lava has burned a garden shed, tires and some metal materials. Dozens of homes, business and other structures are in the area of the lava flow. That number could increase as the flow front widens. Erbin Gamurot, 48, a handyman, said Pele just wants to visit her sister, Namakaokahai, the sea goddess. 'She's doing what she gotta do. That's her way, that's her nature. Who can stop her?' he asked. Left, a palm tree is surrounded by lava as it advances across the grassy pasture below the Pahoa cemetery and right, smoke from the volcano can be seen approaching the village of Pahoa .
