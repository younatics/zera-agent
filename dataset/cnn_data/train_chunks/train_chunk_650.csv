The only strip club to successfully become unionized and the first to function as a stripper-run co-operative has announced it is closing its doors after its landlord refused to re-sign the lease. The venerable Lusty Lady first opened in San Francisco's North Beach area in the Broadway strip club district of North Beach in the 1970s. The club's landlord is Roger Forbes, a strip-joint magnate who is a partner in Déjà Vu, Inc, which owns most of the adult theaters and clubs in San Francisco. Grinding to a halt: The San Francisco Lusty Lady was given two weeks notice to close its doors . Motley crew: The Lusty Lady is known for employing a diverse range of dancers who don't fit into the perma-tanned blond mold . Forbes business partner is Harry V. Mohney, known as the 'Howard Hughes of Porn'. According to SFGate, . Mohney's name does not appear on city permit applications for Déjà Vu, Inc's . clubs in San Francisco, which are solely attributed to Forbes. Investigators . are now determining whether Forbes is the sole owner of the company's . interests in California, because state liquor licensing laws state that . all ownership must be disclosed. Déjà Vu, Inc, has been quietly taking over many of the city's strip clubs and night spots. The club was the second opened by two business associates, the first being Lusty Lady in Seattle, which closed in 2010 citing the financial climate and the online pornography industry for its closure. Originally, the clubs showed 16mm peep show films, but in 1983 live nude dancers were introduced. Peepshow: Private booths, where customers watch dancers, line the corridors at the Lusty Lady club . Co-op: Dancer Lilah Mayhem reviewing time-cards in the office before her shift onstage . In 1997, following several grievances, the Lusty Lady became the only successfully unionized sex business in America. Its dancers, nicknamed Lusties, differ from the usual blonde, pneumatic and tanned women in mainstream strip-joints and are known for their unusual monikers such as Fortune Cookie and Kitty McMuffin. Multi-tasking: Dancers at the Lusty Lady undertake all areas of the running of the business - including its artwork . After its owners decided to close the business, the club's workers bought the club for $400,000 in 2003. Two years earlier, in 2001, Forbes had acquired the building housing the Lusty Lady and more than doubled its rent. Forbes, 71, told The New York Times that he's not evicting the Lusty Lady because it's a competitor to his other businesses, which number eight strip clubs just in the Lusty Lady's North Beach neighborhood, but because of a default on rent. 'If I was concerned about [the competition], I’ve had that building . fifteen years now, I could have found a way not to extend their lease . for the last ten,” he told The New York Times. The Lusties disagree, saying, 'You can say it was because you’re delinquent on rent… but the truth is . that there’s $80,000 that walks through this door every . month that, once you close, is likely going to go to one of [Forbes’s] . other establishments in the neighborhood,” said Scott 'Big Red' Farrell, the Lusty Lady’s general manager. One Lusty Lady worker, identified only as Tora, was more direct: 'Our landlord is a dildo and didn’t want to . negotiate,' she told The New York Times. Unlike the dancers at Forbes' clubs who actually pay the club for their stage time and work as independent contractors, the Lusties belong to the Service Employees International Union and earn hourly wages and overtime. According to SFGate, Mohney, Forbes and their companies have recently been named in a federal lawsuit that alleges the 'leases' they force their lap dancers to sign for their stage time are a scam designed to avoid their legal responsibility to pay minimum wage and employment taxes. 'Mohney and Forbes have created an elaborate scheme of corporations, business entities, trusts, straw men, consulting agreements and licensing agreements, all for the specific purpose of concealing their ownership, operation or control of these clubs, and avoid compliance with various federal and state labor laws,' said the suit, filed in April on behalf of five Déjà Vu dancers. Save the last dance: The dancers at the Lusty Lady are all stake-holders in the business, which is set to close in early September . Many see this latest closure of a San Francisco institution as a sign the city is losing the eclectic small businesses and liberal attitude that has made it so culturally rich. A message on the Lusty Lady Facebook page reads: . 'Dear Ladies and Friends in the Community, . It is with shaking hands & tear stained cheeks that I write to say, we just heard from our land lord, they will NOT agree to a new lease, they are closing our doors. They have given us just TWO WEEKS. WE CLOSE OUR DOORS AND SAY GOODBYE on 9/2/13 . Please help us spread the word, and make it a glorious & glamorous two weeks!Thank you so much for all the love and support over the years! - The Lusties' The two Lusty Lady strip clubs spawned numerous books, articles and film references. Lily Burana, who worked in the San Francisco Lusty Lady documented her experiences there in the 2001 book Strip City: A Stripper's Farewell Journey Across America. Poles apart: Lusty Lady dancers provided a counterpoint to the industry's standard 'look' Lusty ladies: (left to right) Havana, Sybil, Tiamata and Ruby pose outside the front of the Lusty Lady strip club in San Francisco on June 27, 2003 when it first became a co-op . Fond farewell: The Lusty Lady website announced its upcoming closure recently . Another Lusty Lady alumnus Carol Queen, pHD, also wrote about the club in Real Live Nude Girl: Chronicles of a Sex-Positive Culture. She told blogger Vanessa L. Pinto: 'When I began there in 1990, it already had a reputation of hiring interesting, edgy women who would not necessarily have fit at other clubs.  We had punks, dykes, women’s studies majors plus one sexology grad student, me.' A worker at the club, named Prince$$ told The New York Times that if people want to keep their small local strip clubs, they should support them financially. 'I tell people, if there’s a local place they love, hollah with a dollah. You can’t pay the rent with Facebook likes,' she said. Lusty Lady workers once described the worker-owned strip club business model as 'a rare and ideal situation' but 'not without its challenges,' but it seems the club couldn't overcome its biggest challenge, rising rents and increasing homogenization that has touched even the stripping industry. Dancer Courtney Crimson told Vanessa L. Pinto that even though the club is closing, the ideals it embraced will live on. 'Despite this pitfall I feel that the Lusty Lady has started a revolution for the rights of sex workers everywhere. And I feel that this revolution will continue long after we’re gone.'","The landlord of a San Francisco icon, the Lusty Lady, has refused to re-sign the club's lease .

They say that an elephant's family ties can be stronger than those of even the closest knit human clan. And the bond between this elephant calf and its relatives probably saved this youngster's life when his family rallied round to save him from drowning when he got stuck on a muddy river bank. A touching set of pictures taken in the Sabah region of Borneo show the calf getting into difficulty as it tried to clamber up the steep bank after crossing the river Kinabatangan with his mother. Scroll down for video . Family affair: The elephant clings closely to his relatives after they came to his aid when he got stuck on a muddy river bank . Mother's love: The elephant had got stuck on the muddy bank after swimming across the river with his mother. He she is pictured helping him out of the water . Slippery: While the adult elephant has no problems getting to grips with the mud, the baby struggles to get a grip without falling over . Stuck: The mother tries to push the baby up the bank using her trunk, but is unable to get him to safety . With the youngster distressed, mother tries to come to his aid by pushing him up the bank with her trunk. But the task proves too tricky for her on her own. Given the animals' traditionally close family bonds, it is no surprise that two relatives came to the rescue. The pair managed to flatten the mud around the calf, making it easier for him to climb to safety. Once the calf is safe, the adult group gather round him as he clings close to his mother's legs in an adorable show of unity. Photographer Beniot Goossens, of the Danau Girang Field Centre in Sabah, said that it took all three adults about half an hour to get the baby on its way again. Not moving: The distressed elephant is unable to make it to the safety of the trees and is seen slipping . Helping hand: The elephant has nearly made it to the top of the bank thanks to a little help from his mother . Distressed: But the poor baby elephant slips in the mud once again . He said: 'The mother and baby were crossing the river but the bank proved too steep for the calf. 'The mother tried to push it but she couldn't manage on her own so called on two members of her family. 'While the mother pushed the others flattened the mud to make it more accessible for the calf. About half an hour later they were all on their way.' Benoit described the sight as 'emotional'. He added: 'I've been studying elephants for many years but some of the students I was with were blown away by the elephants' behaviour. 'It goes to show that animals often take care of each other better than humans.' Elephants are known for living in tight knit matriarchal families with the adult females looking after their sick, injured, or orphaned offspring. Like human offspring, calves remain with their mothers until they are teenagers, with some female elephants known to stay with their parent for their entire lives. Elephants usually give birth to one calf every two to four years with their babies already weighing around 200lbs when born and standing at 3ft tall.They eventually grow to up to 9.8ft tall and consume a staggering 270kg of food a day. Asian elephants have been domesticated for thousands of years. The powerful beasts have been employed to move heavy objects, such as felled trees, to carry humans on their backs, and even to wage war. Close bond: Another two elephants emerge from the trees to give mother and baby some help .

An inquest heard how a mother put her healthy toddler to bed one night and found him dead the next morning. Stephanie Ballantine from Halesowen, West Midlands, said yesterday that her son had been behaving 'normally' the night before his tragic death on December 28 in the Spanish holiday resort of Playa de las Americas. Alfie Brown died of natural causes while on a family holiday in Tenerife last year. Stephanie Ballantine said her son's tragic death was 'sudden'. She described putting him to bed one evening only to find him dead the following morning. His mother, Miss Ballantine, 19, said: 'It was completely sudden. I put him to bed the night before and found him the next morning.' She told the inquest at Smethwick Council House that Alfie, aged just 14 months when he died, had been playing by the pool 'all day'. Miss Ballantine, who is expecting another child, described Alfie's development as 'completely normal', saying that he had passed medical check-ups 'with flying colours.' Stephanie Ballantine (right) said son Alfie (right) had been behaving normally the day before his death on December 28 . She was joined yesterday by her parents, who were also on the holiday, and Alfie's father Matthew Brown. A consultant perinatal pathologist at Birmingham Women's Hospital carried out a post mortem into Alfie's death on January 10. Dr Phillip Cox said that his death had been caused by bronchitis with bronchial pneumonia. 'It appears to have come on very quickly, but was widespread,” he said. 'We didn’t manage to find out what the organism causing the infection was.' Alfie Brown died during a family Christmas holiday to Playa de las Americas (pictured), a popular tourist resort in Tenerife . Dr Cox ruled out an exotic foreign virus as the likely cause, suggesting that Alfie's death had been the result of a 'nasty virus infection' which originated in the UK. He added that Alfie had 'more likely' died as the result of a bacterial infection. Black Country coroner Robin Balmain, said: 'There is nothing unnatural about his death. It's terribly distressing, I understand that, but it's not unnatural.' He told Miss Ballantine and Mr Brown: 'I am really sorry that this has happened to you. I can't imagine what a shock it was to you both.'","Stephanie Ballantine, 19, told inquest son Alfie was behaving 'normally' day before his death .

Tragic: Brad Rothwell, 11, accidentally hanged himself trying to play a prank on his father and brother . A boy aged 11 accidentally killed himself when a practical joke went too far, an inquest heard. Brad Rothwell regularly played tricks on his younger brother, Bret, which he filmed and uploaded to video sharing site YouTube. But the youngster was found hanging in his bedroom after one of his pranks went tragically wrong. His father, Bryn Rothwell, said Brad may have been preparing to play a joke on him and Bret, ten, who had been out running errands. They discovered Brad on their return and immediately dialled 999, but he could not be saved. Bolton Coroner Alan Walsh described the case as ‘unimaginably tragic’, adding: ‘Pranks can get out of hand – he wasn’t able to save himself.’ The tragedy happened on May 13 at the family home, in Atherton, near Wigan, two years after the youngsters lost their mother, Joanne, 44, to cancer. Mr Rothwell, 55, a dental technician, said Brad had come home from school as normal and stayed behind while he and Bret went out to do a few deliveries for his work. The pair had been gone for just over an hour. He said: ‘As I pulled on to the drive I got a text from my girlfriend and Bret went inside. ‘As I was reading the text he came out and said, “Brad is pretending to kill himself”. I thought he was messing about but I dived upstairs and that’s when I saw him.’ Prank gone wrong: Brad's father said he arrived back at their home in Wigan, Greater Manchester, to find him hanging from the bunk bed . He lowered his son down and gave him . mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before paramedics arrived, but Brad was . declared dead at the scene. Mr Rothwell, who was described by the . coroner as an ‘exemplary father’, added: ‘[Brad] had done videos on . YouTube, jumping out of wardrobes, scaring his brother. He would say to . me, “Don’t tell him I’m upstairs” so he could jump out at Bret. It could . be another prank that he could have been thinking about.’ Brad had . 14 online videos, including one called ‘the best hidden jump’ which . showed him jumping out of a wardrobe to startle his brother. Mr Rothwell said he and his sons had received counselling following the death of his wife ten days before Christmas 2010. Evidence: Brad's father Bryn Rothwell, left, told the court his son, right, would often film pranks he played on them and upload them to YouTube . She spent the last three months of her life at a hospice and Brad had visited her daily. Although . the youngster, who was happy at school and had a wide circle of . friends, rarely spoke about his mother, he was coping with her loss and . had no reason to harm himself, Mr Rothwell added. Police examined his . laptop and mobile phone, but neither revealed any evidence that he had . researched taking his own life or had written a suicide note. Tributes: Flowers, teddies and letters are left outside Fred Longworth High School in Atherton for Brad . Pathologist . Dr Jonathan Pearson confirmed Brad died by hanging and said: . ‘Sometimes people don’t understand how quickly they can lose control of . the situation – it can be seconds before they lose consciousness.’ Recording . a verdict of accidental death, Mr Walsh said Brad was ‘mischievous at . times’ and ‘prone to unexpected behaviour to gain reactions’, adding: . ‘He wouldn’t have known how quickly the ligature would have an . impact … he wouldn’t have been able to save himself.’ He said Brad, . who attended Fred Longworth High School, in Tyldesley, Wigan, was a . ‘model’ pupil, and told Mr Rothwell: ‘To have lost your wife in such . desperately sad circumstances and [then] to have lost your son in this . way is quite unimaginable. I am very, very sorry.’","Brad Rothwell, from Wigan, Greater Manchester, tied himself to his bunk bed .

The Observer also cites about a dozen anonymous sources who worked in Mr Weiner's office at the time, who described a relationship between the Weiner and Azaria as a badly-kept open secret that began long before Ms Azaria left Mr Weiner's payroll in 2006 and continuing when she returned in mid-2008. One former ex-aide, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'You’d have to be an idiot to not know . what was going on.' Another said: 'It was a known secret in . the office.' A third source added they were '100 per cent' sure there was something going on between the two. Revelation: The 'personal relationship' with an aide was said to have ended before Anthony Weiner married his wife Huma Abedin (pictured here with him) The way Mr Weiner behaved around Ms Azaria was in stark contrast to the way he behaved around other staff, the sources added. They claim the behavior continued in 2008, when Mr Weiner, now 48, began dating his current wife, Huma Abedin. Azaria earned $125,202 with Weiner during the 2010 campaign cycle and she earned $86,652 in the 2012 cycle  according to OpenSecrets.org. While relationships between staffers and their bosses are not unheard of, the revelation throws into doubt Mr Weiner's previous claim that his personal relationships were limited to his private life. One of the sources reported the pair coming and going together at all hours while Mr Weiner was running his campaign office from his apartment. The New York Daily News in 2004 described the pair at a late-night party together with comedian Jon Stewart and Leonardo DiCaprio following the Democratic National Convention in Boston. 'Hours after the final gavel ended the Democratic National Convention in Boston, Jon Stewart and Leonardo DiCaprio still huddled at the Roxy with New York Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-Brooklyn & Queens) and his finance aide, Dolev Azaria,' the article read.  'They stayed until the wee hours Friday.' Phone conversations between the pair, overheard by other members of the team, were said to have gone beyond professional boundaries. Scandal: Weiner was forced to resign from Congress in 2011 after admitting to sending lewd pictures to a college student . When one person started at the office they were warned not to say anything negative in front of Ms Azaria because it would get back to Mr Weiner. Another described suspicious holes in Mr Weiner’s schedule when the two would turn up together. A third pointed out Ms Asaria used a holiday photo of them together as her screensaver. Ms Azaria first started working for Mr Weiner’s Congressional office on a part-time basis in 2001, according to Congressional records obtained through LegiStorm. The following year she moved next door to Mr Weiner in his Sheepshead Bay building, campaign finance records show. She was steadily promoted over the next three years, eventually working on Mr Weiner’s congressional and mayoral campaigns. Here salary in 2002 was $26,833.32 and the following year, she earned $29,000. Her swift rise through the ranks earned Ms Azaria a mention in New York Magazine. Teenager: Weiner, pictured here in 2011, also admitted sending texts to a 17-year-old, but denied it had been anything inappropriate . In 2005, an article listed her as someone who had potential to become famous. The article read: 'Two years ago, Congressman Anthony Weiner tapped Azaria to be his campaign-finance director; she oversaw a staff of six, some of whom were PhDs 15 years her senior. 'Now she’s launching her own political-consultancy firm.' In a follow-up article in 2010, New York Magazine reported: 'Azaria is still helping raise money for Anthony Weiner, just like she . was five years ago. But now she has a healthy collection of other . Democrats in her stable — Sean Maloney, John Sabini, David Yassky, . Anthony Weiner, and Mike McMahon. She says she’s angling to get more . involved in the nonprofit sector in the near future. “I remain strongly . dedicated to supporting people whose ideology I believe in and whose . career I want to further, but I also remain committed to giving back to . the larger community and to people in need throughout the world.”' Ms Azaria left Weiner's payroll in October 2006 and returned in June 2008. But questions arose over why she was paid for three months after Mr Weiner was embroiled in the sexting scandal that forced him to resign in June, 2011. He had admitted to sending lewd pictures to a college student. As Ron Brynaert, the former executive editor at The Raw Story, wrote in a blog last year, Ms Azaria received an increase in pay from $6,318 to $8,500 for those three post-resignation months - a rise of nearly 35 percent. The Weiner campaign attributed it to a bookkeeping anomaly caused by the fact Ms Azaria was the last person on his staff and was responsible for closing the office down. Ms Morgan described Ms Dolev as one of Mr Weiner's most 'skillfull' employers and said their relationship was 'appropriate at all times'.","Weiner denied the affair at an event in the Bronx on Friday .

Health guru Hazel Walsh knows exactly what her clients desperate to lose weight are going through - as she has had to battle her own food demons to become the slim size 10 she is today. The 26-year-old, from Bradshaw, suffered from depression and bulimia when she was a dress size 24 weighing 18 stone - but she's turned her life around and now wants to help others do the same. Hazel used to comfort eat on cakes and cookies but - after having surgery to kick start her weightloss - she has now learnt how to eat healthily and exercise to stay in shape. Hazel at her heaviest: 18st and a dress size 24, left, and now a slim size 10 after losing more than 7st . Hazel started putting on weight as a teenager and was bullied as a result. Once she was humiliated when she was asked out on a date which she later found out was a dare to 'pull a fat girl'. She recalled of her youth: 'I was tall and gangly - 5ft 7in - then the weight started piling on so I was a target for bullies. 'I stopped being social and playing . sports and started comfort eating to try to isolate myself. I just ate more food - I started eating junk food, takeaways . and fast food. I always had cakes and cookies after school.' Drastic measure: Hazel has a £6,500 gastric sleeve operation in the Czech Republic to kick start her weightloss . Hazel admitted she suffered episodes of binge eating and bulimia and tried various diets that left her even more depressed when she failed to lose weight. She became so down she was prescribed anti-depression tablets. She said: 'The antidepressants . made me put on more weight so I stopped after two years and decided . something needed to be done.' At age 24, a size 24 and at her wits' end, Miss Walsh booked a £6,500 gastric sleeve operation in the Czech Republic. She started blogging about her experience at prettyfat.co.uk, documenting her . mental as well as physical recovery and progress as she shed more than 7st. Made a career out of her experiences: She has now trained to be a nutritionist so she can help others lose weight . She said: 'I know surgery is drastic . but I'd already tried every diet under the sun. I have been dieting . since I was about 15 and none of them did anything - or if they did the . weight went back on when I came off the diet. 'I started to write a blog about my . progress and I've had people contact me asking me about diet and . fitness. I was flattered that they asked me, so I thought I would do it . as a career. 'I started to learn all about . nutrition and fitness and signed up to a distance learning course last . year. I am just waiting for my diploma certificate in Level 3 Diet and . Nutrition which means I can advise others. I hope to do another qualification in fitness in the future too.' Hazel said she is now the happiest she has ever been and has launched her own business -  healthyeats.co.uk - which she hopes will help others who were in the same position as she was. Help from someone who has been there: Hazel said her weightloss journey helps her know what her clients are going through . She said: 'I am now a size 10 and have lost just over seven stone and I now want to help individuals like me. 'I'll be offering advice on emotional eating, obesity and weight loss, binge eating, compulsive overeating, weight loss surgery and food intolerances. 'I'm aiming to provide clients with a meal plan that they can follow and recipes. I've done all the diets in the world so I know it's easy to be given a plan but when you come off it you put the weight back on so I want to try to teach them to plan what foods to eat and teach them to make healthy recipes.'","Hazel Walsh, 26, was bullied for being a size 24 .

A thief was ordered to pay £25 compensation to a gardener after being caught stealing his 'honesty box' in a Welsh village. Paul Bujega, faces six months of community service after he took the box, belonging to Mark Button, from an open fridge filled with the gardener's produce in Mewslade, Gower, South Wales. Mr Button put the box in the fridge so that honest locals could pay for his homegrown fruit and vegetables. See the CCTV below . Paul Bujega (pictured) was caught stealing the box from the fridge as CCTV cameras Mr Button had installed filmed the incident . But not only did Bujega fail to pay for the drinks he took, he went one step further by stealing the box itself. Bujega, 37, had been at the beach with friends when they drove past the fridge. In a bid to 'show off to his friends', he jumped out of the car and snatched the box, taking the £25 it contained with him. Bujega said he was trying to show off to his friends when he stole the box and its contents, taking canned drinks with him as well . Thankfully, Mr Button had installed CCTV cameras around the area in the event of any such theft. After watching the implicating footage, Mr Button, 45, uploaded still photos of the crime to Facebook. 1,000 people shared the photos on the social networking website, prompting Bujega to hand himself into authorities. The prosecutor said Bujega had broken the number one rule of country life which is being honest. Bujega must complete 6 months of community service for his crime . Mark Button (pictured) says he now calls the box Happy Days as it reminds him of a time when people were more honest . Prosecutor Anwen Evans said that he had broken the number one rule of country life which is honesty. 'Mr Button left an honesty box in the fridge so people could pay for his produce. He also put cans of drinks and ice cream in the fridge for local children coming back from the beach. But Bujega was caught on a secret camera taking the honesty box and cans of fizzy drinks. He told police his friends told him to steal the money after a trip to the beach to pay for their petrol home.' Bujega's lawyer described the incident as 'a moment of madness', and put it down to the fact that the man from Pontarddulais, Swansea, had been drinking. He was ordered to pay Mr Button £25 in compensation - the exact amount of money he had stolen. Mr Button said: 'I call the honesty box Happy Days because it is a reminder of how things used to be in the countryside. It’s great and we’re helping each other out, 99.9 per cent of people love it and respect it. But for someone to just help themselves is disgraceful.'","Gardener, Mark Button, put box in fridge to encourage honest locals to pay for produce .

So the family of seven who live in this isolated building in China may want to think again. The three-floor building stands in the middle of the newly-built Kaiyuan road in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province with the family insisting on remaining in the home. Isolated: A family of seven people insist on living on the building which stands in the middle of Kaiyuan road in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province of China . Out of place: The house can be seen at the end of the large road . Staying put: Despite the road being finished in September last year, the family insist on staying in the house. Fortunately, the road still hasn't been put into use yet . Wang Jiashun, the head of the household, said that the family's decision to stay is nothing to do with money. Several years ago, Mr Jiashun blocked the lane in front of his brother's home after they divided their father's property. His brother took him to court and won the case. Wang Jiaquan appealed to the higher authorities several times against the decision. Wang said that the government must reopen his case first before he thinks about moving. Fortunately for the family, despite the road being finished in September last year , it has still not been opened. As China develops and grows, this is not the only similar case of homeowners refusing to leave. A Chinese man who fought a 10-year legal battle against property developers has been left marooned after they surrounded his home with a water filled moat. New feature: Developers surrounded this different house with a moat . to make it look better for the apartment block resident . Development: 75-year-old Zhuang Longdi refused to move to . make way for more luxury flats . Zhuang Longdi refused to move out and make way for a luxury homes project. The developers have denied they have been trying to force the 75-year-old, and his family to move out of their home in Pangyang village, Jiangsu province, east China. Property firm spokesman Lu Hun said: 'His house is a mess, we had complaints, so we made it into an island to make it more pleasant to look at . 'All the other villagers sold up and left, but he decided to stay and we had to do something.' In order to get in and out of the property Zhuang and his family have to wade through waist deep water. Ironically Zhuang is now thinking of moving, not because of the pressure from developers, or the money they offered, or even the moat. Nail houses are isolated by man-made ditches on the site . of this reconstruction project in Yangji village, Guangzhou city . He said: 'The worst thing is there are . all these high-grade villas everywhere, but I am still living in this . shabby house, and I am ashamed. 'I am now talking again about a move.' When developers in Yangji, Guangdong province, got fed up with negotiating with local home owners to make way for a new office block complex they took matters into their own hands. They used bulldozers to divert a local river so it virtually encircles the householders holding out for better financial compensation for losing their homes. 'The ditch is as deep as a man and twice that wide. They've made it clear that if we want to leave we have to get out before they complete the circle,' said one resident. 'They've already cut off most of the electricity and the fresh water and we're struggling to survive. 'But we won't give in. If they can build rivers, we can build bridges,' he added. The village, with a history of more than 900 years, had housed over 1,400 families with more than 4,000 villagers . The reconstruction project started in 2010 but has to be suspended for two years as some house owners still refuse to move due to compensation issues while 99 per cent of the villagers have been relocated after signing agreements with the developer.","Three-floor building stands in the .

So these photographs of Rihanna cosying up to A$AP Rocky in New York should perhaps come as no surprise. The megastar - who has previously dated Chris Brown and Drake - was snapped getting close with the 24-year-old both on and off camera as they filmed a music video in Manhattan. Friendly: Rihanna and rapper A$AP Rocky looked both close on and off camera while filming a music video in New York . Looking cosy: The megastar was snapped getting close to the rapper at 3am after shooting a music video . The shots - taken in the early hours of Thursday morning - have fuelled speculation that the 25-year-old singer and the Harlem-born rapper - who supported her on part of her Diamonds world tour - are more than just friends. In one, A$AP Rocky - real name Rakim Mayers - can be seen smiling down at Rihanna and leaning towards the star. In another, the rapper has a hand on her shoulder and the pair appear to be kissing. Rihanna and A$AP have been linked in the past, but both parties denied any romantic involvement. Rumours: Rapper A$AP supported Rihanna on the North America dates of her Diamonds world tour . Earlier that night the 25-year-old . singer had stepped out in New York wearing a striking zebra print dress . which covered her from neck to toe. With it’s high neckline and long sleeves the frock was a far cry from Rihanna’s signature risque look. The star was spotted heading for a night out in New York and by the looks of her dress it was set to be a glam affair. Rihanna was hard to miss in her stand out dress which featured a bold zebra print and a bizarre feathered collar. The only hint of skin came as the Diamonds singer walked, with a flash of skin glimpsed through a split in the skirt. Wild thing: Rihanna dresses up for a night out in the Big Apple in head to toe zebra print . Hint of skin: Rihanna covered up in the striking frock but a split in the skirt did reveal a flash of leg . The star finished her look with a slick of bright red lipstick, some simple black heels, and a selection of sparkly rings on her fingers. With her hair back to her short crop, Rihanna made sure her dress did all the talking, leaving the flashy accessories behind. Rihanna's best pal Melissa Ford was spotted leaving the hotel with the chart-topper, in a decidedly more dressed down look of baseball cap and black sweater, as she helped her pal get through the crowd of photographers and fans. Best mates: Rihanna was joined by her best pal Melissa Ford for the evening out, with her friend looking decidedly underdressed . Reports had swirled suggesting the star was filming into the small hours with A$AP Rocky and A$AP Ferg. The trio were all spotted entering the same recording studio earlier in the day, before the group reportedly hit the streets of SoHo to shoot a joint music video. Walking advert: Earlier in the day Rihanna modelled some new pieces from her forthcoming River Island collection . RiRi's night-time look followed another covered up ensemble during the day, which saw the Stay songstress turn herself into a walking advertisement for her Rihanna For River Island line. The star headed to a dentist appointment in a camouflage crop top from her new collection for the high street store. Teaming the tummy baring top with a pair of dark denim boyfriend jeans, metallic stilettos, and a gold Chanel hat, Rihanna made sure her new range was getting a ton of exposure. Covered up again: The chart-topper was stepped out in a camouflage top and rolled up jeans, with a hint of toned tummy on display . With her second collection for the high street store officially launching on September 12, Rihanna has been doing her best to drum up interest. The star stepped out in a few casual pieces again on Tuesday, proving the collection's versatility. Following her fashion show debut earlier this year, the star stated: 'I've wanted to design my own fashion line for a very long time. Label lover: Rihanna paired her own brand top with a gold Chanel cap as she headed to the dentist in New York . 'This is something I've wanted to do ever since I started loving fashion. 'I got passionate about it and every time I saw something on a rack there would be something I'd want to do to it to change it. 'So I felt like the only way I could do that would be to design the perfect thing for me. 'This is my way of doing that - teaming up with River Island and designing clothes for young women with young, sassy personalities.'","Singer and rapper snapped getting close on set in Manhattan at 3am .

While you might think being called Taylor or Jones isn't much to write home about, spare a thought for those saddled with Swetinbedde. And it could be worse because you could going through life as Mr Crakpot, Mrs Drunkard or even Miss Gyldenbollokes. Now the story of those names - and many . others - has been brought to life by author David McKie in his new book, . What's In A Surname? A Journey From Abercrombie To Zwicker. Geography: Many of the UK's surnames, including Bolton and Bradford, derive from place names . While the unfortunately named Crappers, Chaceporcs and Scrapetroughs are the most eye-catching, McKie also offers an insight into better-known names that have made it into the modern period. British names, he explains, fall roughly into four categories: those derived from occupation (Butcher), those handed down by fathers (Watson), those that come from place names (Bolton) and nicknames such as Short or Brown. 'Occupational names are full of . hazards,' writes McKie in the Guardian. 'Farmer? That sounds easy . enough. A man who owns or runs a farm. But farmer used also to mean tax . collector. 'Rymer? A . peripatetic poet, possibly; but also a man who made rims for wheels. Reader is not just someone who reads (when many couldn't); it may well . mean thatcher. Roots: Names that end with -s (Styles) originate in Wales but that end in -thwaite come from the East Midlands . 'Walker . wasn't a name for someone who walked. Everyone walked. A Walker carried . out the same work – treading or crushing cloth – as a Fuller elsewhere.' Interestingly, McKie also discovered that many names also have geographical origins, with those that end in -son indicating northern roots, while names that end with -s - Styles for instance - have Welsh origins. Those whose names end in -by, -thwaite, -wick and -dale tend to originate in the East Midlands, while names that are prefixed by Tre-, Pol- and Pen- come from Cornwall. The UK's most common name Smith, although often thought to be English, actually originates in Scotland, while surnames beginning with P - Parry, Price, Pratt - are overwhelmingly Welsh in origin.

A college student has sparked outrage by posting a sexist blog in which he says the only way to get a woman to tell the truth is to get her naked. The blog post - called 'What I've learned about Women' was posted on Wednesday by Thor Lund, a former student government president at the University of Texas at Austin. His post begins by explaining just how much he loves women. He says: 'I love women, a lot. I love when they look at me, talk to me, and laugh at me.

Fury: college student Thor Lund has sparked outrage by posting a sexist blog in which he says the only way to get a woman to tell the truth is to get her naked . He said: 'The thing I love most about women and trying to convince them to kiss me is that at the core of it, if you can get a girl over to your place and somehow manage to have her take her clothes off, she will be truthful with you. 'It is hard to lie to someone who is lying naked next to you. Girls are lying all day long. They lie about their feelings, their weight, how much cardio they did, and what they think of their best friends oversized purse. 'But at the end of the day, when I get a girl back to my place, she will tell the truth about what she wants to do when she grows up, what her family is like, what her city is like, and why she has that stupid oversized purse. ' He then goes on to explain his 'rules for women' in which he even attributes his own name to a quote. His blog reads: 'When you realise women make absolutely no sense, it all makes sense. - Thor Ericson Lund.' Controversial: This is how Mr Lund began his blog, which he called 'What I've learned about women' His other golden nuggets of information include 'Your only goal is to have fun' and 'Stop trying'. Mr Lund then helfully suggests to his readers that there are just three places you should look at a woman. He says: 'The first is her eyes, because . you can tell if she is interested in you or not with the eyes. The . second is her neck because it is the most sensitive part of her body and . you want to check for an adams apple. 'If she has one of those, she is most likely a man so you should avoid trying to sleep with her/him. 'The third and most important place you . can look at a woman is her toes. Why? Because the toes tell all. If her . feet are pretty and her nails are painted then you can assume the rest . of her body is well groomed and cleaned.' Sorry: Mr Lund issued this apology following the outcry which his blog caused . Following this, he also offers flirting advice to his male readers. 'So the best way to think about women and how to get them to be attracted to you is to do the exact opposite of what you think. 'If you really like her, tell her you . can't stand her. If you think she is pretty, make fun of her oversized . purse and ask her if she keeps a parachute inside it.

Two of the young men who gang raped a high school girl at a homecoming dance have been sentenced to spend decades behind bars. An advocate for the victim, who has not been identified throughout the case, read a statement on her behalf as she chose not to be in the courtroom when two of her attackers- Jose Montano and Marcelles Peter- were sentenced on Thursday. 'You both took a lot from me, more than you will ever know, but I just want to say to the both of you, I forgive you,' Jane Doe wrote in the statement read in court. 'I forgive you because I deserve to be at peace, but no matter...how hard I try and wish I could, I'll never forget and there are parts of me that will never be healed.' Sentenced: Jose Montano (left) was sentenced to 33 years to life for his involvement in the gang rape while Marcelles Peter (right), who was a minor at the time of the attack, faces 29 years . Facing her attackers: While 'Jane Doe' was not in court for the sentencing, she did testify against them during the lengthy trial (pictured in the courtroom sketch) Jane Doe, who is now 20 years old, wrote that even though the attack happened four years ago, she is still 'struggling and fighting' to get her high school diploma. During her testimony, the victim said she still has shoulder and hip problems from . the attack. She also said she now suffers from migraines regularly and . has trouble learning. Her mother added that the girl still faces an uncertain future. 'My baby girl, who once wanted to go into law enforcement, has to choose a different career because of the trauma to her body and mind,' she wrote. The judge presiding over the case, which included six weeks of witness testimony, had a few choice words of her own to add. Justice: Jose Montano, 20, now faces 33 years to life behind bars to beating and raping the then 16-year-old girl . Changed story: Peter originally denied ever being at the scene of the crime, but later owned up to playing a 'small role' 'The only kindness she was shown that night was she was beaten so badly that she doesn't remember what happened to her,' said Contra Costa County Judge Barbara Zuniga. 'It's beyond shocking that a human being can be dehumanized to the extent that Jane Doe was that night,' she said according to the Contra Costa Times. 'She stopped being a human being to you. She became a thing for you to torture and play with.' The victim was a sophomore in high school at the time of the attack. Authorities said the girl was beaten, robbed and sexually abused by numerous men over two hours while as many as 20 people watched. Police discovered her heavily intoxicated, partially nude and unconscious under a picnic table. Brutalized: Known only as Jane Doe, the 16-year-old was found comatose with near-fatal alcohol levels and head injuries beneath a picnic table outside this Richmond, California high school following a 2009 school dance . Jailed: Ari Morales, left, and Manuel Ortega, . right, agreed to plea deals and are serving 32 and 27 years . respectively . Still awaiting trial: John Crane Jr, 43, left, turned . himself into police after the incident and Elvis Torrentes, right, faces . charges including aiding the act of rape that could land him in prison . for 26 years . Peter, who is now 20, was sentenced to 29 years behind bars while now-22-year-old Montano was sentenced to 33 years to life. The difference in the sentences comes from the fact that Peter was a minor at the time of the attack. 'No words can undo what's been done; all I can do is apologize for my actions and wish to move forward from this situation,' Peter said in court. Montano is not believed to have made any statements in court. 'Both of you asked me to give you a second chance,' the judge said. 'Mr. Peter and Mr. Montano, Jane does not get a second chance. Mr. Peter, I can't ignore what you did and I can't ignore what you did, Mr. Montano. She deserves justice.' Accused: Elvis Torrentes (right) and John Crane Jr. (center) still await trial for their role in the attack that involved as many as 20 men and boys. Jose Montano walks behind them to their preliminary hearing in June . Aside from Montano and Peter, two defendants had already taken plea deals in the case. Ari Morales was sentenced to 27 years in prison, Manuel Ortega to 30 years. The final two defendants, John Crane and Elvis Torrentes, were awaiting trial on lesser sexual assault charges. The victim received $4 million to settle a lawsuit against the West Contra Costa Unified School District in 2010.","Gang rape took place on football field during the 2009 homecoming dance at a Richmond, California high school .

A keen cyclist who lost part of his finger in a hunting accident has made himself a prosthetic replacement out of old bicycle parts. Colin MacDuff, 41, accidentally blew most of his middle finger off with a stray bullet in 2010 and has since used his experience as a welder to create a workable fake digit. His creation has become a lucrative business for the war veteran as the prosthetic finger market is underdeveloped. Colin Macduff (pictured) shows his prosthetic finger, which he created using leftover bike parts including a rear derailleur hanger to simulate a normal fingertip . Mr MacDuff charges between £3,550 and £6,100 for a customised mechanical finger for amputees and has obtained a U.S. patent for his business venture. He said: 'My finger has three parts. The tip, the cage, which goes over my amputation and the ring part that sits where a normal ring would sit.' Mr Macduff constructed the prosthetic device using leftover bike parts, including a rear derailleur hanger, to simulate a normal fingertip. After his accident Mr MacDuff, a Gulf War Navy veteran, said ordinary tasks like buttoning his shirt, holding a glass and typing became impossible but doctors told him that there were no prosthetics for finger amputees available. Mr MacDuff charges between £3,550 and . £6,100 for a customised mechanical finger (pictured) for amputees and has obtained a . U.S. patent for his business venture . In a bid to regain dexterity, he used his love of bikes, along with his degree in computer-aided design, to take matters into his own hands. Mr MacDuff said: 'I basically woke my wife up at three in the morning and told her I was going to make a new finger out of bicycle parts - and soon as I was able to, I did. So that's how it came up.' He said he was also inspired by the amputees he saw at racing events who created prosthetic arms using RockShox parts and paraplegics who fitted their wheelchairs with 26-inch mountain bike tires. Mr MacDuff designs the mechanical digits in his home workshop in Olympia, Washington. He uses a manufacturer with 3D printing to create full, partial, and thumb prosthetics made from medical grade plastic; an evolution of the finger be created using old bicycle parts.

It takes roughly 10 to 12 weeks for Mr MacDuff to create a mechanical finger but he hopes that before long he will be able to provide amputees with a device within a week. He said: 'I'm not providing your finger back, I'm providing you a tool for your daily activities - and once you learn how to use that tool - it becomes part of you. 'I actually wear it 24 hours a day...I wear it swimming, mountain biking, gardening, and hunting.'

A husband accused of stabbing his wife 47 times has been released from jail after spending three years awaiting a trial. Valentino Ianetti, 63, was released from the Sussex County jail after . the prosecutor’s office, unable to prove its case, requested that all . criminal charges be dismissed. Mr Ianetti was accused of killing his wife of 37 years Pamela Ianetti, 57, at their Stanhope home in 2009. On the night his wife died according to an arrest affidavit Mr Ianetti called police dispatch to say he had found his wife with multiple wounds in the bedroom on the floor. Mr Ianetti cooperated with police and had blood on his hands, but smelled as though he had just showered or washed, the affidavit says. Investigators used a search warrant to recover a long knife covered with blood, according to the affidavit. From an autopsy, Dr. Junaid Shaikh, a former Sussex County medical examiner, determined the death to be a murder caused by multiple sharp force wounds to the thorax and neck. 'The most significant knife wounds to the victim punctured her liver in multiple locations, her lung and her heart,' Sussex County prosecutor Gregory Mueller told The Huffington Post. But, he said, after the defense presented him with an expert report in May that challenged the manner of Mrs Ianetti's death, he consulted with a forensic pathologist, a toxicologist and a crime scene expert, and then filed a motion to dismiss the murder charges. 'Ethically and morally, you cannot prosecute a defendant where you believe a reasonable doubt exists,' Mr Mueller said. Public defender Steven Insley, told NJ.com that all but one of the stab wounds on Pamela Ianetti’s body were found to . have been superficial - 'hesitation wounds' she inflicted on herself as . she worked up the courage to exact a fatal blow. Release: Valentino Ianetti, 63, has been released from jail after spending three years awaiting a trial . He also said she had ingested enough oxycodone that she was likely on the way to an overdose, he said. 'She had taken between 20 and 40 pills. If not for stabbing herself, . she might’ve died just from the drugs she had taken,' said Insley, . citing what he said was forensic evidence recently uncovered by his . office. “She probably wasn’t feeling the stab wounds.' Authorities never revealed why they believed Mr Ianetti may have killed his wife, who used to work as a nursing . supervisor. The couple did not have any history of domestic violence, according to police. Mr Insley said while in jail Mr Ianetti lost a child, a brother and his home in the borough. He said Mr Ianetti is now living temporariyl with a friend. 'He was angry because of the time he spent in jail, he was crying, but he was happy to see his friends,' the lawyer said. The delay in the case coming to trial was due to a backlog of cases.","Valentino Ianetti, 63, was released from the Sussex County jail .

Mr Vaz called for an end to the ‘immigration arms race’ between the main parties, which he warned had caused ‘nothing but grief’ and left the ‘far-right rubbing their hands with glee’. While rebuking  the coalition for failing to live up to some of its promises on introducing border exit checks, he saved some of his strongest criticism for his own party. Labour’s current policy on immigration became mired in confusion on Monday as Mr Bryant embarrassingly backtracked on a planned attack on two of Britain's biggest retailers. He had planned to use a major speech to attack Tesco and Next for using cheap migrant labour to undercut local people. But after the retail giants hit back, the former Labour foreign minister went into reverse, declaring: 'I fully accept that Next and Tesco indeed often go the extra mile to try and recruit more local workers.' In a withering rebuke, Mr Vaz said: ‘It is not an answer to lecture companies such as Next on where they should recruit their workers from.’ And he took a swipe at Gordon Brown’s . infamous attempt to woo voters unhappy at the idea of foeign workers . taking jobs. ‘”British jobs for British workers"" is a jingoist message . which should never pass the lips of a politician,’ Mr Vaz said. Not enough: Mr Vaz slammed his party leadership for trying to criticise retailers including Next for not hiring British workers . Red-faced: Labour's shadow immigration spokesman Chris Bryant was forced to re-write a major speech on Monday after being condemned by Tesco and Next . In an article for the Leicester Mercury, Mr Vaz added: ‘The challenges with our immigration policy will not start on this day; they started a long time ago. ‘Seven years ago a Labour Home Secretary, John Reid, described the UK Border Agency as ""not fit for purpose"", yet it limped along for another five years before being abolished. ‘The previous Government oversaw the disastrous contract for E-borders, the method by which we count people in and out, which so far has lost the taxpayer £750 million.’ Last month Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg admitted that exit checks at borders to tackle illegal immigration would not be reinstated before the election. He admitted the Government would not meet a pledge to put in a system to track everyone who leaves Britain by 2015. But he accused Home Secretary Theresa May of moving too slowly and said he was sending in Lib Dem minister David Laws to speed things up. Mr Vaz said the coalition could not continue to blame Labour for a situation where ‘all you have to show on departure is your boarding card, not you passport’. He called for ‘zero tolerance of illegal migration’, with loopholes closed, prompt responses to letters and an end to health tourism. The Leicester East MP: ‘We desperately need a consensus on immigration. Let's stop this dangerous war of words, initiate a ceasefire and put forward some proposals that can command the respect of the British people. It's time to end the immigration arms race.’","Chairman of powerful Commons committee in attack on own party .

British girls being taken abroad for forced marriages are being urged to hide spoons under their clothes in order to alert authorities to their plight. As Britain puts airport staff on alert to spot potential victims, one campaigning group says the trick has saved some youngsters from coerced unions in South Asia. The concealed cutlery sets off the metal detector at security control in Britain. Girls - and sometimes boys - can then be taken away from their parents to be searched, which gives them a last chance to seek help from airport staff. Thousands of young women are being taken 'on holiday' to marry a stranger in a country they don't know . The British school summer holidays, now . well under way, mark a peak in reports of young people - typically girls . aged 15 and 16 - being taken abroad on 'holiday', for marriage . without consent, the government says. The bleep at airport security may be the last chance they get to escape a union to someone they have never met in a country they have never seen. The spoon trick is the brainchild of the Karma Nirvana charity, which supports victims and survivors of forced marriage and honour-based abuse. Based in Derby, central England, it fields an average of 6,500 calls per year from around Britain. However, the organisation says this number has already been reached with another four and a half months to go until the end of 2013. It says this increase is due to increased awareness of the issue. When petrified youngsters ring, 'if they don’t know exactly when it may happen or if it’s going to happen, we advise them to put a spoon in their underwear,' said Natasha Rattu, Karma Nirvana’s operations manager. When the girls go though security, the spoon will set off the alarm - if 16 or over, they will be taken away to a safe space . When the spoon sets off an alarm, 'they will be taken to a safe space where they have that one last opportunity to disclose they’re being forced to marry,' Rattu told AFP. 'We’ve had people ring and tell us that it’s helped them and got them out of a dangerous situation. It’s an incredibly difficult thing to do with your family around you - but they won’t be aware you have done it. It’s a safe way.' The charity is working with airports - so far London Heathrow, Liverpool and Glasgow, with Birmingham to come - to spot potential waring signs, such as one-way tickets, the time of year, age of the person and whether they look uncomfortable. 'These are quite general points, but there are things that if you look collectively lead you to believe something more sinister is going on,' said Rattu. People who come forward can be escorted out of a secure airport exit to help outside. Marriages without consent have led to suicides and so-called honour killings. Officials fear the number of victims coming forward is just the tip of the iceberg, with few community leaders prepared to speak out and risk losing their support base. One woman, whose identity has been protected by Essex Police in southeast England, was forced to get married in India. She said she was threatened by her father 'because he said if I thought about running away he would find me and kill me'. 'I was shipped off with a total stranger. 'That night I was raped by my husband and this abuse continued for about eight and half years of my life.' She eventually fled. Last year, the Foreign Office’s Forced Marriage Unit dealt with some 1,500 cases - 18 per cent of them men. A third of cases involved children aged under 17. The oldest victim was aged 71; the youngest just two. The cases related to 60 countries: almost half were linked to Pakistan, 11 per cent to Bangladesh, eight per cent to India, and two per cent to Afghanistan. Other countries involved included Somalia, Turkey and Iraq. Calls to Karma Nirvana tend to spike before the British school summer holidays and again at the end, said Rattu. 'The holidays are a really good time for young people to go missing because there is nobody accounting for where they are at school,' she said. Since Ramadan ended last week, calls have risen again, including one from an 18-year-old who has fallen pregnant - her family is trying force her into marriage to conceal it. Burdened by codes of 'izzat', or family honour, youngsters can be put under extreme physical and emotional pressure to marry relatives in a culture and country they were not brought up in. If they refuse, they are often threatened with being thrown out of the family - or worse. 'It really takes a brave person to stand up against their family,' said Rattu. 'In June 2012, the Government announced that forced marriage will become a criminal offence and by doing so we are sending out a clear message that this brutal practice is totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated in the UK. 'The Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) provides direct assistance to victims as well as undertaking a full programme of outreach activity to practitioners and communities, to ensure that people who are in contact with victims are fully informed about how to approach such cases.  Statutory guidance is already available to support those agencies that exercise public functions to safeguard children or vulnerable adults. 'This year the FMU is handing out ""Marriage: it's your choice” cards, to all professionals across the UK, including airport staff, safeguarding professionals, teachers and NGOs.  These cards will provide victims and potential victims with key information, in addition to signposting them to where further confidential advice and support can be obtained.' A third of forced marriage cases involved children aged under 17. The oldest victim was aged 71 .","Thousands of British youngsters sent 'on holiday' to marry a stranger .

Battle: Tom Brown, 67, says he has been the victim of a 'relentless pursuit' by the Post Office in the past five years . A sub-postmaster accused of stealing £85,000 by the Post Office has won a five-year battle to clear his name. Tom Brown, 67, from South Stanley, County Durham, has been told he will face no further action after the company said it could not enter any evidence just months before he was due to appear in a civil court case. Police launched an investigation when it emerged there was a £85,426 shortfall at North Kenton Post Office in 2007, but after four years looking into the claim, they told him he would not face criminal charges. Mr Brown, who was given a certificate of valour by the Post Office in the mid-90s after fending off a knife-wielding robber, has always maintained the shortfall was the result of a glitch in the company's controversial Horizon computer system. It is claimed more than 100 people . across the country have been the subjects of false allegations by the Post Office as a . result of a computer error. A campaign group, the Justice For Sub-postmasters Alliance, run by Alan Bates, of Old Colwyn, Conwy, helped in Mr Brown's fight. A number have registered an interest in suing the Post Office over the false accusations. Despite police dropping the case, lawyers acting for The Post Office Ltd pursued two charges of false accounting against Mr Brown through the civil courts.  But the company has said it no longer pursuing the case because it is 'not in the public interest' and a judge has recorded not-guilty verdicts. Mr Brown, a grandfather-of-three, says he is relieved but has criticised Post Office bosses for their 'relentless pursuit' over the past five years. He said: 'I've lost nearly £300,000 in property, lost my home, been declared bankrupt and had my name dragged through the mud. I knew there was something wrong in the shop and I thought somebody was taking money but I kept it quiet for six months. 'That's the biggest mistake I made. When the Post Office did an audit they found all this missing money and I was suspended. 'Without my salary I couldn't afford to pay the staff and I couldn't afford to pay the bills. I was made bankrupt. They wanted to search my house and they went through my car. I said to them, 'You won't find £85,000 in there"".' Mr Brown lost his wife, Carole, to breast cancer in 2003 at the age of 57. The couple had worked together since 1981 when they bought the Chester Moor post office before taking control of a site on Colliery Row Post Office in Fence Houses. Problems: Mr Brown always maintained the £85,000 shortfall was due to a computer glitch . Mr Brown said: 'Because my wife was ill - they said she only had 18 months to live, but she survived for three years - we gave up the branch and moved into a new house. 'After she died, I started working in Finlays in North Kenton and eventually bought the site. 'I had a three-bedroom detached house in West Pelton and a flat across the road, which I rented out. 'When I was suspended I lost all that and I lost £50,000 a year in Post Office salaries. All the staff I've ever worked with in Newcastle think I stole £85,000. They've dragged my reputation through the dirt. 'When I was told that it was all over I was over the moon, I was absolutely elated. But the hardest thing is knowing that my wife and I worked for so many years, doing so much to try to make sure my family was secure.' Mr Brown has now entered into a 'mediation' period with Post Office bosses as he wants compensation for five years of 'torture'. North Durham MP Kevan Jones has championed Mr Brown's fight and raised his plight in Parliament. Last night Mr Jones told The Journal it was a 'scandal', stating: 'The way Tom has been treated is verging on cruel. 'Ministers must now act to ensure victims of these Post Office allegations get the compensation they deserve. I have written to ministers today and will be pursuing Tom's case very hard.' Backtrack: Mr Brown was months away from appearing at Newcastle Crown Court for the civil case before it was dropped . Last year the Post Office instructed a firm of forensic accountants, 2nd Sight Limited, to conduct an independent review of 10 existing cases raised by a number of MPs and the law firm Shoosmiths. About 100 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses have registered an interest in suing Post Office Ltd over its Horizon computer system, which records financial transactions in branches across the UK. The Post Office has repeatedly denied there is a problem with the system, saying the claims have been made by a very small number of people. But Mr Jones criticised Business Minister Jo Swinson during a Parliamentary debate last month, saying a report had found there was scope for the Post Office 'to improve aspects of its support and training for sub-postmasters'. A Post Office Ltd spokeswoman said: 'Post Office Ltd has determined that in this case it is no longer in the public interest to prosecute.' She added: 'The Post Office is committed to supporting its people and improving the way we do so. The interim review published recently by independent investigators Second Sight makes it clear that the Horizon computer system and its supporting processes function effectively across our network. 'As the review notes, it is used by around 68,000 people in more than 11,500 branches, successfully processing more than six million transactions every day. The review underlines our cause for confidence in the overall system.' In relation to other cases, she said: 'We would not comment on other cases. However, cases are only prosecuted where they meet and continue to meet the requirements of the code for Crown Prosecutors. That code requires both an evidential test and a public interest test to be applied. The code also requires the prosecution to keep under review whether or not that test continues to be met.'","Tom Brown, from Durham, suspended after shortfall was discovered in 2007 .

Brian Frain, 36, was rumbled by first wife Anne-Marie Sim when she saw pictures of his second wedding - to Margaret Meredith - on Facebook, seven years after they separated. He claimed that he had married for a second time, because he thought the marriage was automatically voided as they were separated.

Frain said: 'I will take my punishment, because I know when I come out of prison, I will be with the love of my life. 'I have done the crime, so I have to take the punishment. 'I have held my hands up from day one. I did do it, but I did not do it deliberately. 'I assumed that after seven years apart, the marriage was void.

Now, Dominic is nine-months-old and is a happy, healthy baby and doctors have confirmed that he has grown out of the condition. Support worker Mr Willis said: ‘To me, as soon as it happened I was preparing for doctors to tell me he wasn’t going to wake up the next time. ‘Every day I woke up thinking: “This could be the day”, it felt like a time bomb ready to go off and destroy my world. ‘I could feel it in the pit of my stomach and I never really allowed myself to believe that he would survive. Apnoea of prematurity occurs when the central nervous system is not yet mature enough to allow non-stop breathing. Baby Dominic had to wear a special breathing device to make sure he had a constant supply of oxygen . This causes large bursts of breath followed by periods of shallow breathing or no breathing. Dominic¿s condition was particularly severe and the apnoeas were more common and longer than in other cases. Apnoea of prematurity is when automatic breathing suddenly stops. It tends to occur in premature babies and occurs because the baby’s central nervous system is not fully developed when they are born. Most babies can be roused from an apnoea episode simply by tapping or rubbing them to make them more alert, and most grow out of the condition as their body grows and develops. Although apnoea usually resolves itself by the time most premature babies go home, a few will continue to have episodes. In these cases, the baby will be discharged from the intensive care with an apnoea monitor. The child may also need to take caffeine medication for a short time. ‘He had an apnoea at least twice a day, and up to six times a day, for 13 weeks. There wasn’t a day that went by that he didn’t stop breathing. ‘The staff stopped our son from dying over and over again. Nothing we can do will ever be enough to say thank you.’ Ms Thompson went into labour with Dominic 14 weeks before her due date. He was born at Middlesbrough’s James Cook University Hospital.

Instead of being in my womb, he was in the incubator and that would look after him until he was ready to be born properly.’ Dominic’s worst apnoea occurred during one of the parents’ visits to the hospital. Mr Willis said: ‘He was in Rachel’s arms when he stopped breathing and the monitors went mad. ‘I watched him go more and more blue. ‘The first step is to shake him a bit and rub him gently to see if that gets him going. Then they tilted his head back. Dominic¿s worst apnoea occurred during one of the parents¿ visits to the hospital. Mr Willis (right) said: ¿He was in Rachel¿s arms when he stopped breathing.

You just need to spend 30 hours a week gardening and do it for 30 years! That’s how long 70-year-old Stuart Grindle has spent turning a former vegetable plot into the picture of perfection it is today. Mr Grindle mows his lawn six times a week and keeps the grass cut to an impressive 5mm. He was so determined to protect his precious grass that he even banned his son Jonathan from playing football on it when he was a boy. Anne and Stuart Grindle stand on the hallowed turf, proudly showing off their immaculate garden at their home in Rotherham, Yorkshire . Stunning blooms, neat borders and vibrant shrubs dot the stunning green lawn . Mr Grindle is a former winner of the Doncaster In Bloom Best Garden competition . Dedicated Stuart, who is a retired joiner and lives with his wife Anne, 69, said: 'It is my pride and joy, most people probably only get out the lawnmower once a week but I cut my lawn twice-a-day, three days a week. 'People think it’s astroturf because it’s cut to 5mm long and in such good condition. That’s down to watering it and cutting it often. 'I suppose I am a bit of a golf and gardening geek. Anne is a bit of a golf and gardening widow.' The 70-year-old has spent 30 hours a week for the last 30 years tending his magnificent blooms and bushes . The self-confessed 'gardening geek' mows his lush green lawn SIX times a week to exactly 5 mm . In an effort to encourage her husband from his haven, Mrs Grindle rings a bell to grab his attention. Mr Grindle added: 'She has a little bell she rings when she wants me to come in from the garden. 'It’s not unknown for me to go out at 9am or even earlier. When I entered competitions and when I was preparing for the open garden day I was out there at 7am. 'I’ve managed to play golf twice in the past week but you know there’s still work to be done when you get home - thankfully it’s light until nine o’clock at the moment.' Anne Grindle has to catch her husband's attention by ringing a bell to summon him away from his haven . Mr Grindle transformed the former vegetable plot into a floral paradise and threw open his garden gates to raise money for charity . Mr Grindle added: 'I have spent 30 years getting it to this state and I can put in 30 hours a week. It’s a full-time job.' Wife Anne confirmed that she was allowed to walk on the hallowed turf, but said Stuart had banned his son Jonathan from playing football there when he was a boy. She said: 'There were no ball games allowed, Stuart always said there was a cricket field and a football field up the road he could use instead.'

Paralympic gold medalist Victoria Arlen, who is paralyzed from the waist down, has been told she cannot take part in the Montreal World Championships days before it took place because she is not disabled enough. The New Hampshire teenager, who won a gold medal in the London Games last year, was already in Montreal with Team USA when the International Paralympic Committee made its ruling. The IPC decided that 18-year-old Victoria, who was paralyzed by a rare neurological disorder seven years ago, was not suffering from a permanent disability and so was not eligible to be a paralympian. Scroll down for video . Disappointed: Gold medal winner Victoria Arlen, who is paralyzed, has been told she is no longer eligible to be a Paralympian . 'I’m so heartbroken with what has happened,' Victoria said, according to NESN. In a Facebook post the swimmer, who broke world records for the 100m and 400m freestyle, said: 'To have trained so hard this past year . and come so far only to be humiliated and targeted by the IPC for . reasons unknown baffles me.' A statement released by the IPC, on the opening day of the world championships on Sunday, said: 'IPC Swimming can confirm that Victoria . Arlen of the USA will not participate at the 2013 IPC Swimming World . Championships and future IPC Swimming competitions having failed to . provide conclusive evidence of a permanent eligible impairment.' When Victoria competed as part of team USA at the London Olympics last year she was classified as between being a 5 and 6 in a system where 15 is nearly able-bodied, according to ABC News. Because of her paralysis she swims with only her arms. Victoria, who was a runner up for ESPY's Best Female Athlete with a Disability award this year, developed a rare neurological condition that paralyzed her and left her in a coma for three years. The condition, transverse myelitis in association with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or ADEM, damages nerve cell fibers in the body. Paralyzed: The teenager, who holds two world records, lost the use of her lower body through a rare neurological disease . Penalized: Victoria, a runner up at the ESPY awards this year, was banned because of the possibility that she may one day regain the use of her legs . 'It started off with flu-like symptoms and pain, then I started feeling really funny,' she said. 'In two weeks I was paralyzed from the waist down ... every ability I had was slowly slipping away.' The IPC had requested more analysis into her condition after the London Games last year. A report was provided by USOC in July and, after references to the swimmer's name was removed, it was sent to five independent medical experts for their opinion, IPC spokesman Lucy Dominy wrote to ABC News. 'All were in agreement that the report, its assessment and its diagnosis fail to provide sufficient evidence of an eligible impairment leading to permanent or verifiable activity limitation - which is required under the IPC Swimming Classification Rules and Regulations,' she said. Victoria's father was disgusted by the ruling, saying: 'This kid has trained seven days a week for years and now she is being railroaded out.' He added: 'What kills me is their people have no experience with my daughter's disease and have given an opinion. They've got every disability in this organization, but this is discrimination. It's crazy.' New Hampshire Governor Maggie Hassan has also rallied on the teenager's behalf. Shock: Swim champion Victoria was already in Montreal when she was told she cannot compete . In a letter to the IPC she wrote: 'The basis for ruling Victoria ineligible - the possibility that she might one day be able to resume use of her legs - is nothing short of disgraceful, undermining the very values of courage, inspiration, determination and equality that the International Paralympic Committee aims to promote.' A doctor contacted by the family to ensure Victoria would not become further paralyzed through her condition, had suggested that the teenager could one day be able to walk again if she had years of physical therapy. Dr Michael Levy, of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, added however: 'It will take many months to years to get Ms Arlen back on her feet. I did not mean to imply that Ms Arlen would be able to walk quickly.' 'Please do not misconstrue my plan as a statement of permanence of her disability,' he said, according to ABC News. Victoria said: 'I am not walking now and I won’t be in the near future, that’s for sure.' Heartbroken: Victoria Arlen, pictured her receiving a silver medal at the London Games, was turned away from the championships . 'I want to remain hopeful and I am being penalized for being hopeful,' she added, according to CBS Boston. After being turned away from the Montreal championships, Victoria went to California with her mother and boyfriend. The triplet, who has three brothers, . said: 'I am keeping my head held high and I am not bitter, discouraged . or angry against them.'","Neurological disorder means Victoria Arlen can only use upper body .

Alexis Wright, the Zumba prostitute from Maine, had sex with more than 100 men for money because she believed she was working as an undercover agent for the State of Maine investigating 'sexual deviancy' in the sleepy town of Kennebunk - or at least that's what she's telling her husband. Wright, who is serving a 10-month sentence after pleading guilty to reduced charges, is refusing to testify at the trial of one of her alleged johns, invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Wright appeared in court today and gave her married name, Alexis Sandra Trowbridge. It appears her husband, Jason Trowbridge, believes her story and is taking her back. Pleading the Fifth: Alexis Wright, serving 10 months in jail, took the stand today and refused to testify against one of her alleged clients . Wright is claiming that her business partner Mark Strong, a private investigator, told her that he had hired her as an undercover agent . Wright's husband Jason says he believes his wife's story and is standing by her. Prosecutors say she had sex with more than 100 men for money - sometimes five in a day . Wright, 30, now maintains she was a pawn all along. It has emerged that Wright claims that Mark Strong, her business partner who was found guilty of promoting prostitution, told her that he was on special assignment for the state of Maine and that he had hired her as his undercover agent. Wright claims that Strong, a licensed private investigator, told her that the brothel she operated out of her Zumba studio was really an elaborate sting operation backed by the state of Maine. The goal, Wright claims she was told, was to catch sexual deviants in Kennebunk. Strong's attorney said Wright's claims are laughable. 'That this woman, who had allegedly taken on 100 or so men to have sex with for money, was investigating for sexual deviancy, is the pot calling the kettle black,' lawyer Daniel G. Lilley told MailOnline. The attorney for Strong, who was convicted of promoting prostitution and sentenced to 20 days in jail, said Wright's claims are laughable . Wright is refusing to testify against her alleged johns and has declined an immunity agreement, as well . Lilley said it doesn't appear prosecutors bought her claim. There was no evidence presented at Strong's trial that he had said he was working for the government. Wright's husband Jason Trowbridge, however, does seem to believe her. He stood by his wife in an interview with a TLC documentary called 'Sex, Lies and Zumba.' 'It sounds crazy. It just made more sense that's what was going on,' Mr Trowbridge told the documentary. 'Put the pieces together. That fits the story. 'People think it's a joke and people might always think it's a joke. I'll stand by her story because that's what I saw.' Wright first made reference to her bizarre claim when she spoke up at her sentencing hearing. She claims that the meticulous records she kept and the fact that Strong had to be watching via webcab during each of her trysts are proof that she thought she was having sex with the men as part of an official government investigation. Wright was called to the stand to testify against Donald Hill, a former high school hockey coach who was one of 68 men arrested and charged with being clients of Wright, according to the Portland Press Herald. Hill, who was forced to quit his job after he was named publicly, maintains that Wright led him to believe he was having a romantic relationship with her.","Alexis Wright, 30, is now going by her married name Alexis Sandra Trobridge .

One of the world's richest men has put his faith in three US banks by investing  $3 billion (£1.9 billion) in them. Warren Buffett, who is chairman, CEO and primary shareholder of investment firm Berkshire Hathaway, has bought an additional 4.96 million shares in Wells Fargo & Co worth $2.2 billion (£1.4 billion). Wells Fargo is the investment firm's largest stock holding which swelled 1.1 per cent after it increased its stake, which now totals 463.1 million shares. Confidence: Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (pictured in 2008), has funnelled $1.9 billion into three major US banks . Meanwhile, the business tycoon has also funneled $745 million (£477 million) into US Bancor and $161 million (£103 million) into New York Mellon, according to CityWire news service. The veteran investor has previously spoken out about his confidence in US banks as a solid investment. In January, in interview with Bloomberg, he highlighted three reasons to back them. Quoted in Forbes magazine, he told Bloomberg: 'The banks will not get this country in trouble, I guarantee it.' He continued: 'The capital ratios are huge, the excesses on the asset side have been largely cleared out… we own bank shares and I personally own stock in banks… I do not see problems in these things.' Yesterday, alongside the banking investments, the 82-year-old's firm also reported buying a 17.8 million-share stake in Suncor Energy Inc, Canada's biggest oil and gas producer which has a large presence in the Alberta oil sands. That stake was valued at $524 million (£336 million) at the end of the second quarter. It also reported a small, 547,312-share stake in Dish, the satellite TV company run by billionaire Charlie Ergen, valued at $23.3 million (£15 million) on June 30. Berkshire Hathaway's biggest stock holding is Wells Fargo & Co, pictured in in a downtown San Francisco, in which is has just increased its share by another 1.1 per cent . The changes were disclosed in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing made public on Thursday, which detailed $89 billion (£57 billion) of Berkshire equity investments, mostly listed on US exchanges, as of June 30. US regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter, and the disclosures can offer a window into their strategies for buying and selling stocks. Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire discloses sizable new investments because investors try to copy Buffett, the world's fourth-richest person according to Forbes magazine. Meanwhile, speculation has been mounting since May as to who will succeed the billionaire tycoon at the helm of the investment firm. Buffett announced at the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting that he knows who his successor is, but he declined to name the person or persons. After just four years, Ms Britt has become a trusted confidante of the billionaire and chairwoman of four of his companies . Tracy Britt, 28, a Harvard graduate who has been mentored by Mr Buffett since 2009, is considered the investor's right-hand man and some say has a good chance of stepping into his shoes. After just four years, she has become a trusted confidante of the billionaire and chairwoman of four of his companies, which bring in $4 billion (£2.56 billion) combined annually. In 2007, in a letter to shareholders, Buffett announced that he was looking for a younger successor, or perhaps successors, to run his investment business. Speculation is mounting that Britt is that successor.","Warren Buffett has funneled $2.2 billion into Wells Fargo & Co - his company's biggest stock .

A mother-of-two who went to extraordinary lengths to con her family and friends out of thousands of dollars by convincing them she was dying of cancer has been sentenced to just community service. Lori Stilley, 41, from Delran, New Jersey, pleaded guilty in May to theft by deception for receiving $12,000 from more than 300 people across 20 states after falsely claiming she had bladder cancer. She even deceived her own children into believing she was dying. On Thursday, she was sentenced to 500 hours of community service - the maximum amount of time - but did not receive a prison term as she still has custody of her daughter, 13, and son, eight. Superior Court Judge James W. Palmer Jr. said that Stilley not only terrified her children with her tearful claims - but that she maintained the cancer was real and only pleaded guilty because she could not afford a trial. Sentenced: Lori Stilley, 41, faked having terminal cancer and received $12,000 in donations. On Thursday (right), she was sentenced to 500 hours of community service for the scam . 'I have never heard of such an outrageous thing,' he told Stilley in the courtroom, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. 'I'm almost speechless. It's despicable what you've done.' Stilley went to extraordinary lengths . to dupe her friends, family and strangers, even writing a book about . her experience, making t-shirts and holding fund-raisers in the scam. In February 2011, Stilley told those close to her and posted on Facebook that she had been diagnosed with cancer. In April, she said her condition had . worsened, and supporters quickly raised more than $12,000 . for medical expenses, prepared her meals and even paid for the . 'inspirational' mother's wedding. Dream day: After learning about her cancer, friends and strangers rallied to help her afford her wedding . Her . 'Team Lori Rocks' support page on Facebook attracted more than 300 . friends, all eager to make the New Jersey woman's life as happy as . possible in her last few months. When they learned she wanted to marry . her boyfriend William before she died, her army of supporters donated . their own money to pay for her wedding. She . penned a 306-page e-book, I'Mpossible - How a Facebook Group Loved Me . Through Cancer and sold it on her website, earning $3,000 from it, . authorities said. She . wrote: 'I pray I will be around to look at this book 20 years from now . with my children. If not, I have a sense of peace knowing they have . their Mommy's story to keep for the rest of their lives. I'm still . waiting on that miracle.' Fundraiser: She pleaded guilty in May to theft by deception for receiving $12,000 from more than 300 people across 20 states after falsely claiming she had terminal bladder cancer . Efforts: She received donations from 300 people across 20 states when friends set up a Facebook group . But, after suddenly announcing a 'miraculous recovery' in November, suspicion arose around the mother-of-two's 'condition'. Supporters realized they had not seen . any medical bills or doctor's notes, and no one had been with her when . she had visited the hospital for her cancer. Stilley was never treated or even diagnosed with cancer, the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office and Delran police said. Prosecutor . Robert D. Bernardi said in a statement: 'To represent that she was . dying from this terrible disease for the sake of personal gain and . sympathy goes way beyond simply being a criminal offense; it was . extremely cruel to those who were concerned and worked hard to lend . assistance.' At her sentencing, Stilley's attorney, Adam S. Malamut, presented the judge with letters from family members and friends asking that she received a lenient sentence of just 100 hours. Hurtful: She was sentenced to 500 hours of community service after family members said she had inflicted unimaginable distress on relatives - including children who now needed counseling . But Stilley's own younger sister and ex-husband both asked the judge to impose the maximum allowable punishment because of the grief she had put the family and children through. Her sister, Lisa DiGiovanni sobbed as she recounted how her sister told her in January 2011 that she had developed a small tumor - before later learning she had Stage III bladder cancer. 'I couldn't sleep,' she said. 'My life became consumed with helping Lori.' She said her two children have been devastated by learning that their aunt deceived them, and that her teenage son has needed counseling to deal with depression as a result. 'My sister faked an illness, but she has taken so many lives' DiGiovanni told the judge. Free: The judge did not give her prison time as she still has custody of her two children . Stilley's ex-husband, Brian Schenski, added that his 13-year-old daughter had left her fearful to visit him or go to school as she was worried 'that Mommy would die when she was not home'. He said that Stilley once even yelled at her daughter after an argument: 'How could you be so mean when you know Mommy's dying?' Judge Palmer added that he was shocked that Stilley apparently had such little remorse. 'You didn't appear to be serious about this offense, and this disturbs me,' he said. 'You've got to understand that this was just awful.'","When Lori Stilley, 41, claimed that she had terminal cancer, friends, family and strangers rallied to raise more than $12,000 .

The son of Boston Red Sox announcer and former player Jerry Remy is accused of brutally stabbing to death his girlfriend just a day after the hulking former security guard was released without bail for assaulting her. Jared Remy, 34, was arraigned today on murder and domestic assault charges in the gruesome slaying of his partner of seven years, Jennifer Martel, which took place at their Waltham, Massachusetts home in the presence of their four-year-old daughter. Police arrived at the residence in the Windsor Village apartment complex at around 9:30 p.m. on Thursday following multiple 911 calls. They found Martel, 27, bleeding in the fenced-in patio covered in stab wounds. Hulk: Jared Remy, pictured, appears at Waltham District Court for his arraignment, Friday, August 16, 2013 . Middlesex Assistant District Attorney Lisa McGovern said Remy attacked Martel in the kitchen, in the living room and on a stairway before pinning her to the ground of the patio where he stabbed her repeatedly. 'Great force and great effort was made by this defendant in stabbing Miss Martel over and over and over again' McGovern said, labeling the attack a 'protracted struggle.' Remy, a hulking muscle-man, was arrested at the scene after he held his hands over his head and surrendered to officers. His clothing was soaked with Martel's blood and, according to WBZ-TV, he had an engagement ring in a sunglasses case in his pocket. Just feet away lay Martel's body, shirtless and covered in blood with stab wounds to her front left shoulder area as well as wounds to her neck. A blue cloth covered her face. 'There was a substantial amount of blood on the ground surrounding the victim's head and upper torso area,' police said. 'Martel was motionless, not breathing.' Tragic: Martel, pictured, was found bleeding from multiple stab wounds on Thursday night . Horror: The stabbing took place while the couple's daughter, pictured, was home . On Wednesday, Remy, who in 2005 . admitted beating up a former girlfriend, appeared in Waltham District . Court to face allegations that he assaulted Martel in a domestic . violence incident on Tuesday night. He allegedly threw her against a mirror. He was released on personal . recognizance, and Ryan said that . the bail recommendation made by her office was based, in part, on a . conversation with Martel. 'The bail recommendation was based on a totality of circumstances,' Ryan said. She . added: 'On Wednesday, a (bail) request was made based on the . information that we had on Wednesday.

Martel's mother told The Boston Herald that her daughter had been 'planning her escape' when she was allegedly murdered by her long-time boyfriend. 'She said, ""I was planning my escape,""' Patty Martel, 53, said. 'This was on Wednesday. She said, ""Don’t worry, I’m planning my escape.""'

'And that's why he killed her, because she called the cops on him.' At least one neighbor, Benjamin Ray, in the apartment complex rushed to Martel's aid and tried to pull Remy off her. But he was driven back when Remy waved his knife in Ray's direction, McGovern said. 'It's not an easy thing to watch. It's not an easy thing to try and stop,' Ray told Boston.com. 'I did what I could to stop it. And it wasn't enough.' Witnesses told police they saw Remy 'on top of Miss Martel stabbing her repeatedly with the knife' on the patio.

BBC bosses will not be investigated by police over claims the law was broken when huge pay-offs were given to senior managers. The Metropolitan Police said there was 'insufficient evidence of dishonesty or criminal misconduct to begin a criminal investigation'. It comes after the Corporation called in external auditors to widen the search for excessive severance payoffs made to its senior executives. Questions: The BBC is under pressure over the scale of severance payments to senior managers . Director general . Tony Hall ordered KPMG to look at . deals made to departing staff prior to 2010 to get to the bottom of the . severance pay scandal. The . National Audit Office is also investigating the files of 90 senior managers . handed golden goodbyes in the past three years to see if they breached . contractual limits. But the controversial pay-outs will not be the subject of a criminal investigation, Scotland Yard said. Conservative MP Rob Wilson last month . called on the Met Police to investigate allegations of fraud and . misconduct in public office. The . Reading East MP asked officers to examine the merits of a wider . investigation ‘as to the possibility of fraud, collusion in fraud, . misuse of public funds, or other wrongdoing in relation to severance . payments at the BBC in recent years’. In response Scotland Yard said it was 'gathering information' on cases to see if the law had been broken. But today a spokesman said: 'The Metropolitan Police Service received allegations of misconduct in a public office and fraud in relation to severance payments and wider benefits for senior BBC managers. 'These allegations have been carefully assessed by officers from the Fraud Squad, Specialist, Organised and Economic Crime Command. 'The assessment, of available material, has concluded there is insufficient evidence of dishonesty or criminal misconduct to begin a criminal investigation, and the MPS will not be taking any further action.' Police: Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley told Tory MP Rob Wilson that fraud squad officers were gathering evidence covering BBC pay-offs, but now Scotland Yard says it has found insufficient evidence to launch a criminal probe . The NAO's first report identified one case . where a BBC executive was paid £300,000 in lieu of notice after their . redundancy was agreed - despite serving their notice in full. The . payment, equivalent to the cost of 2,062 licence fees - was agreed by . then director-general Mark Thompson, and the unnamed figure’s redundancy . was paid even though they had found a new job. The . report also highlighted the case of former BBC2 controller Roly . Keating, who was given a £375,000 pay-off but returned the money last . month after learning it had not been properly authorised. Its devastating report found the BBC . handed its staff £369million over eight years, but only looked in detail . at the most recent cases. The . KPMG review means even more high-profile deals could come under . scrutiny, including a £500,000 payoff to former BBC1 controller Peter . Fincham in 2007. He resigned . in disgrace after he was criticised for making false claims about . doctored footage of the Queen. Lord Hall has already asked for a . ‘detailed briefing’ into his payoff, although the BBC has not yet . confirmed whether it will publish what he is told. Another . historic payoff likely to come under the spotlight is a six-figure sum . handed to Lesley Douglas, a former controller of Radio 2 who resigned . over the ‘Sachsgate’ scandal involving Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross. Many BBC staff on lower salaries are understood to be furious at the high severance payments. In his email to staff earlier this month, Lord . Hall tried to boost morale, saying: ‘I know this issue has provoked a . very strong reaction from many of you and I understand why you feel that . way. 'It is worth saying however that severance pay in general was part . of an attempt to reduce senior management numbers, and in the process we . did save £35m which went back into programme-making and will continue . to do so at a rate of £19m a year as we move forwards. ‘However, it is clear this was not . done in accordance with best practice – that is why we have already . tightened up procedures and also why we will not contemplate this level . of payoff in the future, even though senior posts will continue to . decline in number.’ A BBC spokesman would not comment on which specific deals KPMG is likely to look at. Findings will be published on September 9. But this week it emerged KPMG has spent thousands of pounds wining and dining some of the executives responsible for the most controversial payoffs. Lord Hall's decision to call in the firm was questioned after the company lavished some of the key figures in the scandal with hospitality including concert tickets, champagne and meals at top restaurants.

Settlement negotiations are being held to divide up the $300 million estate of reclusive heiress Huguette Clark, with one month left until trial. A battle over her fortune is currently raging between her distant family and lawyer, doctor and former employees - the family are in line to . receive millions if a deal is struck. The heiress to a copper, timber and railroad fortune had no children and spent the last 20 years of her life living at Beth Israel Medical Center until she died in 2011 aged 104.

In July papers filed in Manhattan Surrogate Court revealed disturbing allegations in the battle over Miss Clark's fortune. According to the papers seen by the New York Post, . the heiress was mumbling incoherently and unable to hold the pen when . she signed her $300million fortune away to her lawyer, doctor and . employees.

Earlier this month it was revealed a . sensational new book is set to reveal the tragic, bizarre life of the . reclusive heiress Huguette Clark. Written . by a distant relative Paul Clark Newel Jr and Pulitzer Prize-winning . investigative journalist Bill Dedman, the biography offers tantalizing . details about the French-born multimillionaire who was fixated on . life-like dolls and building miniature castles - often splashing out . thousands of dollar to realize her visions. Family of fortune: Ms Clark, right, as a child in 1917 with her wealthy father and her sister Andree . One example of typical excess from the early . life of Miss Clark came when her mother sold a painting her daughter . took a deep dislike to in order to help a struggling musician. 'Madame . Cezanne in Red Dress' by Paul Cezanne terrified the young Huguette so . much so that she rarely stepped foot out of her bedroom once her mother . Anna E. Clark hung it in their 42-room, Fifth Avenue apartment, . according to the New York Post. According to the new biography, widowed Mrs Clark solved the problem in 1945 when acclaimed cellist Robert Maas came seeking her help. Maas wanted to form a string quartet but could not afford instruments. He told the wealthy widow of four rare Stradivarius violins languishing in a Manhattan store which could only be purchased as a group. Mrs Clark promptly snatched the Cezanne masterpiece from the wall and had her driver take her to an art gallery where she sold the painting and then paid $200,000 ($2.6million today) for the violins. The generous donation led to the formation of the Paganini Quartet, a renowned classical violinists which became famous the world over. Behind closed doors: Few people entered the 42-room home of the reclusive heiress which was filled with rare dolls . Such lavish spending became commonplace in the life of Huguette Clark, turning her adult-life into a strange place filled with childhood obsessions. She spent millions of dollars building up a collection of rare French and Japanese dolls. According to the Post, one of the few people who visited Clark at her apartments in the 1950s said that a long gallery was lined with dolls, each seated on its own sumptuous armchair. One of Ms Clark's few outings was to attend Christian Dior fashion shows in order to find clothes to dress her dolls. The heiress was also obsessed with building miniature models. A lover of Japanese culture, although she never traveled, Clark paid for someone to travel to Japan to photograph and note the specifications of the castles she wanted to build from the confines of her mansion. While she stayed at the hospital, her . three fabulous homes sat empty: the $100million Bellosguardo estate, a . $24million country house in Connecticut and a $100million co-op, the . largest apartment on Fifth Avenue overlooking Central Park. She . inherited her wealth from her father, Montana Senator William Clark, . and his copper mines but regarded her great wealth as 'a menace to . happiness'.

Judge Michael Thornsbury was indicted Thursday for conspiring to imprison the husband of his married mistress after she broke-up with him . A judge in West Virginia was indicted Thursday for conspiring to imprison an innocent man - the husband of his former lover. Michael Thornsbury, 57, has been the sole circuit court judge in Mingo County, West Virginia since 1997. He was accused Thursday of attempting several times to get his lover's husband arrested and imprisoned after the two broke up. According to the indictment me attempted to frame the man for drug possession, larceny and assault. Now suspended from his position without pay, Thornsbury faces 20 years in jail if convicted as well as an expected civil case . Thornsbury . started dating his longtime secretary Kim Woodruff in early 2008, but . she ended the relationship in June 2008 because she was married. A scorned Thornsbury allegedly attempted to get her back by putting her husband, Robert Woodruff, behind bars. According to the indictment, Thornsbury first tried to get Woodruff arrested for drug possession. He . asked his friend Jeff Cline to plan drugs underneath Woodruff's pick-up . truck and then made plans to alert police so they could conduct a . search. But at the last minute Cline backed out. Next, prosecutors say Thornsbury tried to get a police officer to accuse Woodruff of stealing scrap metal from his employer. Woodruff . worked at a coal processing facility and his bosses allowed him to take . any scrap metal that had fallen in with the coal. When . Thornsbury found out about this, he convinced State Police Trooper . Brandon Moore to file a criminal complaint against Woodruff, accusing . him of stealing. Moore, a former . 'Trooper of the Year', resisted at first since he knew that Woodruff's . bosses allowed him to take the metal, but filed the complaint anyway. Woodruff was arrested for grand larceny in December 2008, but the case . was dismissed when the county prosecutor disqualified himself from the . case. The things he did for love: The indictment accuses Thornsbury of trying to frame his romantic rival for drug possession, grand larceny and assault . Prosecutors . say Thornsbury even appointed his business partner Jarrod Fletcher . (Mingo County's director of homeland security and emergency management) to head a grand jury on Woodruff. Apparently . the two conspired to write subpoenaes requesting documents on Woodruff . from all his employers, which Fletcher would sign off on. Most of the businesses complied but one business requested more time. When . Thornsbury denied that request, the company started a legal battle that . eventually revealed the relationship between the judge and the head of . the grand jury. Thornsbury . was tireless. Last year, Woodruff was beaten up and threatened with a . gun by two men at a convenience store. The two aggressors were arrested . and charged with assault. But . then a month later the charges against the aggressors were mysteriously . dismissed and instead Woodruff was charged with assault and battery. Thornsbury . allegedly tried to use his clout as circuit court judge to sway the . county prosecutor in pushing for the maximum six-month sentence. Stripped of his position: Thornsbury has been suspended without pay and his law license has also been suspended in light of the indictment . Prosecutors say that would have been 'an extraordinarily harsh punishment even if (Woodruff) had been guilty.' Woodruff . refused to take the six-month plea deal and eventually that case too . was dismissed because the prosecution didn't think it was in the . interest of justice. The Woodruff's lawyer Mike Callaghan said the couple plan to sue. Thornsbury was indicted in court Thursday and released on $10,000 bond. While leaving the court he seemed confident he would win his defense. 'The truth will be told and I will be acquitted,' he said. Thornsbury has been suspended without pay.

Spared prison: Ayan Hadi, the wife of white Muslim convert Richard Dart, admitted failing to give police information about his terrorist plot . The wife of a convicted terrorist has received a 12 month suspended sentence at the Old Bailey for failing to provide information that might have helped in his arrest and prosecution. Ayan Hadi, 31, of Acton, west London, had already admitted failing to alert the authorities when her husband Richard Dart, a white Muslim convert, had planned to fly to Pakistan for combat training which could then be followed by violent acts of terrorism. She had pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to failing to provide information that she knew or believed might have helped secure the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of her husband for an act of terrorism. In sentencing Mr Justice Sweeney, sitting at the Old Bailey, told Hadi that 'justice could be tempered by mercy' particularly in cases involving someone who is vulnerable or in a relationship with a defendant. Hadi had been in an abusive first marriage, felt isolated and wanted a happy home life, the court was told. She was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment suspended for two years, a two year supervision order plus a 10 year notification requirement where she will have to tell the authorities of her whereabouts. Dart was jailed for six years in April with two co-conspirators Jahangir Alom and Imran Mahmood for engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism. The judge told Hadi that there had been 'an element of choice' in her decision not to alert the authorities after Dart revealed his intentions to her in November 2011. He also noted that having a first husband who was 'clearly abusive' towards her had 'coloured in part your relationship to the information' which Dart told her. Dart also put her 'in a difficult position' by making her 'choose between your love for him' and balancing out her duty to tell the authorities. The judge noted that Hadi was of good character and that neither she nor any member of her family had shown any Jihadist sympathies. Hadi and Dart met on the internet in . August 2011, they married a month later and she claimed she had no idea . he was an extremist until she later saw a BBC documentary by his . step-brother Robb Leech - called My Brother The Islamist. Jailed: Richard Dart was sentenced to six years in prison for planning acts of terrorism in April . The . judge said: 'You have demonstrated remorse for your behaviour. This . experience has made you aware of your responsibilities which you should . have been aware of in the first place.' Remorse: Ayan Hadi's lawyer said she had no idea her husband was an extremist until his half-brother made a documentary about him . Imran Mahmood received nine years and nine months, and Jahangir Alom was jailed for four years and six months. At the time they were sentenced, the judge said they were all 'committed fundamentalists' who would have been prepared to kill. Dart and Alom travelled to Pakistan . to try to get terrorist training, and took advice from Mahmood who had . already visited the country, the court heard. Former BBC security guard Dart also . discussed bomb making with Mahmood, and spoke of targeting the Wiltshire . town of Royal Wootton Bassett - which became a focal point for the . repatriation of UK soldiers from Afghanistan. Dart, who changed his name to . Salahuddin al-Britani, became involved in extremism after moving from . his home town of Weymouth, Dorset, to east London and fraternising with . radical Muslim Anjem Choudary. Emails between Hadi and Dart showed . that she 'endorsed his security conscious approach' including the need . for passwords, the judge said. He noted it was 'equally clear that Dart made his terrorist intentions plain'. Mozammel Hossain, defending, claimed . that Hadi was a decent woman now with a young child who had married Dart . while 'not knowing the type of man that he was'. He described her as a woman who . wanted a warm loving home life but she was quite weak willed. She . suffers from a post-natal condition. Suspicion: British soldiers and Marines killed in Afghanistan pass along the High Street in Wootton Bassett, where the terror group was believed to be targeting . 'She was desperate to have a family, to be married and have a child,' Mr Hossain claimed. Her first husband was an abusive man who kept her locked up in the house, the court was told. Mr Hossain added she did not 'condone . or support anything that her husband stood for' and there is 'no . evidence in this case that this lady held any radical or extremist . views. It was all about her desire to keep in touch with her husband.' Dart, a . son of teachers, also discussed bomb-making with Mahmood, and military . repatriation town Wootton Bassett as a potential target. Police . discovered fragments of text on his laptop that revealed that the pair . had used the computer to have a 'silent conversation' to avoid possible . surveillance bugs - opening a Word document and taking it in turns to . type, then deleting the text. They . mistakenly assumed none of it would be stored on the machine but . forensic experts who worked through 2,000 pages of computer code . deciphered fragments of what was said, including Mahmood making a . reference to Wootton Bassett and then adding: 'If it comes down to it, . it’s that or even just to deal with a few MI5 MI6 heads.' The trio were captured in a huge . surveillance operation by Scotland Yard and MI5. Investigators learned . friends Dart and Alom teamed up with Mahmood in a bid to train with Al . Qaeda in Pakistan, after a previous trip ended in failure. Transformed: Richard Dart, pictured climbing a tree with his step-brother Robb Leech, was converted to Islam by hate preacher Anjem Choudary . Co-conspirators: Former PCSO Jahangir Alom . (left) and Imran Mahmood (right) were jailed for four years and . nine years respectively after pleading guilty at the Old bailey . Mahmood said he had seen a bomb-making manual. Mr Justice Simon told the trio they . held 'radical Islamist beliefs and have shown yourselves to be committed . to acts of terrorism'. Mahmood and Dart were both given . extended sentences, meaning that they will serve two-thirds of their . prison terms rather than half, and they will spend five years on . licence. The judge said that they were all 'committed fundamentalists' who would have been prepared to kill. He told Dart and Mahmood: 'I'm . satisfied to the required criminal standard that neither of you had . ruled out an attack in the United Kingdom, and that you, Mahmood, were . looking at arming yourself with a bomb.' Extreme: Dart has made several appearances on . YouTube and on BBC TV discussing his faith and his views, as well as . attending several anti-British protests in London (right) Stand: Dart pictured before his arrest during a Muslims against Crusades protest against the Royal Wedding outside the House Of Commons . Counter-terrorism teams also believed that the pair used the same tactic walking down the street with a mobile phone. Mr Justice Simon said the men held ‘radical Islamic views’, were ‘dangerous’ and could kill. Choudary, whose groups . Islam4UK and Muslims Against Crusades have been banned, launched an . extraordinary defence of Dart, saying he was jailed for a ‘thought . crime’ and had ‘committed no sin and harmed nobody’, adding ‘Jihad . training’ is a duty for Muslim men.

The benefits cheat has been teaching the sport to children and adults, as well as running his own security business, Wolverhampton Magistrates Court heard. A blow to the system: Mark Ashman (right) has been exposed as a benefit cheat after claiming incapacity benefit while working as a boxing instructor . Over a three year period, he has received £21,742.48 in incapacity and disability allowances. He pleaded guilty to one count of failing to notify a change of circumstances affecting his entitlement to benefits between March 1 2009 and August 12 last year. Chair of the magistrates Beryl Farrow said: 'Mr Ashman, what you have done is disgusting, taking money from society. Lots of people can't even save that money in a lifetime.'

The body of the fourth victim of a North Sea helicopter crash was recovered from the aircraft wreckage today, as all Super Puma flights to and from British oil rigs were suspended. Helicopter operator CHC said it has grounded the AS332 L2 aircraft which ditched without warning into the North Sea off Shetland while carrying 18 workers on Friday evening, killing four people. The company has also suspended all UK commercial flights of three other Super Puma models following a recommendation from an aviation safety association. Scroll down for video . Investigation: The wreckage of the Super Puma L2 helicopter which went down in the North Sea with the loss of four lives at 6.20pm on Friday, around two miles west of Sumburgh Airport on Shetland . Response: The wreckage floats on the surface as the operation to recover the helicopter and the last of the four bodies was completed today . The offshore industry's Helicopter Safety Steering Group (HSSG) urged the precautionary measure until there is ‘sufficient factual information’ to resume flights. Rescuers have now recovered the final body from the site of the crash around two miles west of Sumburgh Airport. The cause of the accident is not yet known. Those who died have been named as Duncan Munro, 46, from Bishop Auckland, County Durham; George Allison, 57, from Winchester, Hampshire; Sarah Darnley, 45, from Elgin in the Highlands and 59-year-old Gary McCrossan, from Inverness. The helicopter was being operated by CHC for oil company Total and was transporting workers from the Borgsten Dolphin platform when it is believed to have experienced a ‘catastrophic’ loss of power as it approached the airport on the southern tip of Shetland's main island. The HSSG is made up of representatives from oil and gas firms, contractors, helicopter operators, offshore unions, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The group met in Aberdeen yesterday and recommended the temporary suspension of all Super Puma commercial passenger flights to and from the UK's oil and gas installations. This includes the AS332 L, L1, L2 and EC225 models. Loss of power: The helicopter was being operated by CHC for oil company Total and was transporting workers from the Borgsten Dolphin platform . Difficult task: RNLI volunteers and Coastguard workers inspecting the wreckage of the Super Puma L2 helicopter which went down in the North Sea with the loss of four lives at 6.20pm on Friday . CHC said it was ‘devastated’ by the accident and would follow the recommendation, which allows for the operation of emergency rescue flights. Fellow operators Bond Offshore Helicopters and Bristow have also enforced a temporary suspension of Super Puma flights. Bristow said three flights scheduled for today had been cancelled and further updates would be issued in due course. The HSSG will meet again on Wednesday to review the suspension unless ‘any significant information come to light before this date’. Industry body Oil & Gas UK has meanwhile arranged a meeting of operators and major contractors tomorrow to discuss ways of minimising the impact of the grounding of flights on the offshore workforce. Scotland's Finance Secretary John Swinney said the government did not anticipate that the temporary suspension would have any immediate impact on the production of oil and gas in the North Sea but that the situation would be closely monitored.

Thirteen male and female specimens live together in a large outdoor cage at Muenster University in north-west Germany. However, following complaints from nearby homeowners who said they cannot sleep because of the noise of their wild-sex sessions, they were this week the subject of a hearing in the city's Administrative Court.

Yesterday, a judge ruled the cage was too close to neighbouring houses. It is just two metres from where gardens begin and by law should be at least three metres away. A sign on the door of the guinea pigs cage reads: 'These animals live in non-committal, mixed-gender groups and mate with every possible partner.' Pavo Rueder, 69, whose house borders directly on to the guinea pig area, said: 'Don't we know it. 'They are unbelievably loud and stink to high heaven. It's unbearable.'

A young student who died after working 'crazy hours' as an intern at a top investment bank was days from being offered a full-time job at the company, it was claimed today. German student Moritz Erhardt collapsed in the shower of his student halls in east London just days before completing a gruelling internship at Bank of America Merrill Lynch International investment bank division. Friends of the 21-year-old, who had recently completed a study abroad programme at the University of Michigan, claimed he had been forced to work through the night eight times in a two week period in an effort to secure long term work with the firm. A source told The Sunday Times he was about to be offered a £45,000 analyst job at the bank starting after he graduated from university next year. The source said: 'He was one of the best interns. They hadn't made him the offer yet because they didn't get that far but it was going to happen.' Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Friday that it will be reviewing working conditions of its employees, particularly those of junior staffers, after the death of Erhardt. His emails and swipe card will be analysed to discover what times he entered the company's building near St Paul's Cathedral in the City. It is believed the student regularly left the office at 5am only to return to the flat to have a shower and change his clothes before returning to work. CCTV evidence shows him returning to his flat just after 5am on the day he died. Grueling internship: Friends of the 21-year-old claimed Mr Erhardt, pictured, had been forced to work through the night eight times in a two week period . When he did not show up for work, another intern who lived in the same flat, called the building managers who found Erhardt's body in the shower at about 8.30pm on August 15. It is believed he may have had an epileptic fit possible caused from exhaustion. In an online portfolio Mr Erhadt told prospective employers that his upbringing taught him to always be driven to be good at everything. He wrote: 'I have grown up in family that expected me, in whatever respect, to excel in life. 'Therefore I have become highly competitive and ambitious nature from early on. 'Already during my times in elementary school I began playing soccer as well as tennis, I engaged in track and field athletics, and I started ski racing. Superstar: Friends called Mr Erhardt, pictured center, the 'superstar' of the internship programme . 'Sometimes I had a tendency to be over ambitious, which resulted in severe injuries. 'With respect to my performance in school, I was striving for excellence and trying to be the best all the time.' Reflecting on his intensive approach to his education he added: 'Over the last year, I have learned that complacency implies stagnancy.' The profile also shows that prior to his seven week internship at Merrill Lynch, he had also completed placements at KPMG Consulting, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank's corporate finance division. Mr Erhadt had studied business administration as an exchange student at the University of Michigan before attending WHU Otto Beisheim School of Managment in Vallendar, Germany.

Head of PR Peter Augstin said: 'We are all deeply shocked. He was a wonderful person and a dedicated student.  He will be sadly missed. We are still trying to come to terms with his death.' Paid interns at the bank normally earn £45,000 ($70,550) a year pro rata - around £2,700 ($4,200) a month.

A Virginia man with two wives in different parts of the state has been arrested after he posed as a CIA agent in a bid to hide his elaborate double life from the young women. David Jin Lee, 26, of Williamsburg, is married to a Norfolk-based sailor and another woman, with whom he has a child, in Fairfax. After he asked the sailor to send him $2,000 claiming he had been captured and tortured by North Korean agents on a CIA mission to China she became suspicious and the Naval Criminal Investigation Service began to unraveled the plot. Investigators quickly learned Jin Lee was not in the CIA and had been staying at a home in Fairfax. Agents and City of Fairfax police searched the home and interviewed the woman who lives there with her father. She said she was Jin Lee's wife and the mother of his child. A marriage certificate at the Fairfax County Courthouse confirmed the union. 'That means bigamy here in Virginia, and it's a serious offense,' City of Fairfax police Lt. Craig Buckley told NBC News. 'It's a Class 4 felony.' NCIS investigators found a CIA coin, a gun and items that could have been used to make fake CIA badges from the Fairfax home. 'They did find a laminating machine and several laminating materials that could have been used to manufacture those identification cards, so that was certainly of use,' Buckley said.

A BBC Panorama journalist sparked a 'farcical' £14,000 terror alert at the broadcaster's Salford headquarters after sending a package that was mistaken for a bomb. Specialist bomb squad officers were called and hospitals put on standby after what was thought to be a suspicious package arrived at MediaCity earlier this week. Explosives experts were about to carry out a controlled explosion on the parcel when it was revealed it was actually a home-made spy camera. Terror alert: Specialist bomb squad officers were called and hospitals placed on alert after a package sent to the BBC's Salford headquarters was mistaken for a bomb . Scene of panic: The BBC's MediaCity development in Salford . The package was sent by a Belfast-based journalist, who works for the BBC's flagship current affairs show, Panorama, to a colleague at Salford Quays. It comprised a tiny recording device inside a plastic bottle of drink, which looked exactly like a bomb when X-rayed. However, shortly before bomb squad officers were due to carry out a controlled explosion, Greater Manchester Police said a senior employee phoned them and claimed it was part of a 'security test' being carried out by Panorama journalists. But in a later call, the employee claimed the package was a 'bug' that should have been sent in the BBC's internal post. A BBC spokesman denied the package was sent as a 'security test' and said:'The package . contained filming equipment and had been sent from BBC Northern Ireland . by Royal Mail because it was needed in Salford the following day. 'This was categorically not part of an investigation testing security procedures. 'There . was a stamp on the outside of the package that showed it had been sent . by BBC Northern Ireland and it was addressed to a producer at BBC . Salford. 'The package was referred to the police, as it was believed it looked suspicious. 'Everyone acted in good faith and we discussed what happened in detail with the police yesterday.' The incident has infuriated police commissioner Tony Lloyd, who has now vowed to send the force’s £5,000 policing bill to the BBC Director General, Tony Hall. He also labelled the blunder an ‘irresponsible’ diversion of resources. Bomb detectives were called to Swiss Post on Broadway, near the BBC studios, shortly after 9am on Wednesday after security staff raised the alarm. They were joined by five specialist hazard response teams from the North West Ambulance Service - trained to deal with major incidents - at a further cost of between £3,000 to £4,000. In addition, fire crews, including three pumps, two station managers and a specialist support unit were also put on standby, costing about £5,300. Furious: Police commissioner Tony Lloyd (left) has vowed to send the bill to BBC Director General Tony Hall . Initially, explosives experts concluded the package was either an ‘elaborate hoax’ or a real bomb - until the BBC revealed it was actually a home-made ‘bug’. A police source said: 'The package was . sent from Belfast and when it was put through the X-ray at the sorting . office, it immediately aroused suspicion, because there was a device in a . plastic bottle which had had all hallmarks of an IED (Improvised Explosive . Device). 'It was initially treated as a serious threat or a hoax, so all the usual protocols were followed. 'Shortly . after the alarm was raised, a senior BBC employee rang to say to it was a . security test being carried out by Panorama journalists. 'But then . the employee claimed it was all a terrible misunderstanding and the . package should have been sent in the BBC's internal post.' Mr Lloyd has now called for a full internal inquiry. It is understood police interviewed several BBC employees after the incident, and concluded no criminal activity had taken place. Call for inquiry: James Harding, the BBC's director of news, will be asked to investigate Panorama's involvement in the blunder . Mr Lloyd said: 'Whatever has happened here, whether a deliberate hoax or a stupid mistake, it caused severe disruption to the emergency services and the local community in Salford. 'The cost of this operation to the police alone is likely to be around about £5,000 and I will be sending the bill to the BBC’s Director General. 'It’s not right that the people of Greater Manchester should have to pick up the tab for Panorama’s stupidity. 'I will also be writing to James Harding, the new Director of News at the corporation, as I expect him to carry out a full review of the circumstances. 'The BBC owes it to the people of Greater Manchester to explain how Panorama caused this farce to happen, and what they will do to avoid a repeat of it.'","Package sent by Belfast-based Panorama journalist to MediaCity colleague .

A former Ohio theater teacher described as a 'master manipulator' who secretly videotaped teenage girls in their locker room was sentenced to four years behind bars on Thursday - but not before six of his victims bravely confronted him in court. Lawrence A. Dibble, 44, pleaded no contest to charges of voyeurism and to sexually abusing one teenage girl as it emerged the pervert had been filming his students since 2002. One-by-one, his victims walked into the court room to testify how Dibble conducted his lessons in a 'cultlike' manner, instilled fear into them and made them change into tight, revealing leotards with no underwear underneath. Scroll Down for Video . Pervert: Lawrence Dibble did not dare look at his victims as they each testified against him in court in Columbus, Ohio on Thursday . One of Dibbles victims told the Columbus, Ohio court how she needed to spend four-months in a trauma-treatment center for abused victims, while another said that to this day she still suffers from severe panic attacks. All asked Judge Tim Horton to sentence Dibble to the maximum of 17-years in prison, but were ultimately disappointed that due to a technicality he only received four years. 'We felt like we belonged, and we thought we were safe. He exploited that. He used us,' said former Wellington student, Lauren Neidhardt. One of the schoolteachers former students told the court the full extent of Dibble's creepy classes and how each student had to promise their souls to him. Victims: Corrine Steger (left) was sexually and physically abused by Dibble and he videotaped Lauren Neidhardt (right) as she undressed . Outraged: Some of Dibble's victims were too upset to speak in court - and so their parents spoke on their behalf . Traumatic: Another unidentified victim of Dibble came forward to speak at his sentencing today in Columbus, Ohio . Alexandra Vickery, a 2006 graduate of the school, said she is forever . shaken by the sight of the naked pictures that Dibble took of her . 'At one point, I even signed as a witness for his contract of another student's soul,' said victim Corrine Steger. Steger said that Dibble would terrify his students into silence - and even used physical force to frighten them. 'One time, facing me with his hands around my throat, he told me and I quote, 'I won't kill you today', she said. The brave victim said that Dibble would make her rub his back and then one day touched her inappropriately. 'He patiently waited until after my 18th birthday, and then he molested me just a month before I graduated,' she said. The victims made it clear to the court that whatever the outcome, it was important that Dibble was removed from society. Shame: Corrine Steger addresses the court while Dibble simply stares straight forward . 'If he doesn’t go to prison, there’s no doubt in my mind there will be other victims,' Lauren Neidhardt said. 'It’s all he knows.' Dibble was told by the judge that in addition to his sentence he would have to register on the sex offenders list for 15 years. 'He held a position of trust, and this was not an isolated incident,' the judge said. Described by prosecutor Ron O'Brien as 'smug and arrogant', Dibble did not even look at his victims as they read their statements. Steger told the court that Dibble groomed her from the age of 12 until she turned 18 in April 2009. Crimes: Lawrence Dibble was a theater teacher at The Wellington School in Columbus, Ohio and committed his crimes between 2003 and 2006 . It was her complaint to police that led to Dibble being arrested and investigators finding videos of her and another 19 students that he had filmed from 2003 and 2006. Alexandra Vickery, who graduated in 2006, said that naked pictures that Dibble took of her when she was a child still continue to haunt her. Fighting back tears, Vickery said that she when her children attend school, she 'will question every moment that they spend with a teacher. I will wonder if their school is a safe place...The terror will never go away.' Another victim, Payton Cohn Thompson testified that she still has nightmares about Dibble and has to take anti-anxiety medication. Sentenced: Judge Tim Horton said it was important that Dibble was removed from society .

'It’s not fair that the night before my wedding, I had a nightmare about him,' she said of Dibble reported the Dispatch.Com . 'It’s not fair that when I woke up on the day of my wedding, he was the first person I thought of.' Incredibly, a pastor at Dibble's church spoke on his behalf to try and lessen his sentence.

A Beijing theatre audience 'gasped in shock' after a banned image of a lone protestor blocking a line of Tanks in Tiananmen Square was shown on a giant screen during a Cirque Du Soleil show. The iconic image was flashed up for several seconds during the troupe's first night performance of Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour in the Chinese capital according to the South Morning China Post. The picture, showing a man standing in front of four tanks as they entered Tiananmen Square during a government crackdown on protests in June 1989, are banned by Chinese authorities along with any mention of the infamous massacre itself. Protest: The iconic Tiananmen Square Tank Man image that is banned from being shown in China but was flashed on a giant screen during a Cirque Du Soleil performance in Beijing . Opening night: The image was shown in a Cirque Du Soleil production of Michael Jackson: The Immortal. A promotional poster for the show is pictured . The editor of entertainment website That's Beijing, Stephen George, said in a blog post that the photo was shown on stage during a montage of famous protest images during the song They Don't Care About Us and resulted in 'an audible collective gasp from the audience.' According to CNN, he said: 'The very fact it was displayed, so publicly and on such a large movie theater screen in front of so many people -- and in Beijing, of all places -- felt genuinely quite radical. 'As my friend commented, ""I can't imagine ever being witness to that image being shown in Beijing again, even if I stay here for another 50 years"".' Mr George's post has since been deleted, according to reports. But show publicist Laura Silverman said that the art troupe had submitted the entire show to Chinese authorities for vetting prior to the performance but that they had not flagged the banned picture up. Popular show: Cirque du Soleil perform their interpretation of Billie Jean during the Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour . The image was deleted from subsequent performances but the show, which was on a three night run in the city, went on as planned. The infamous image featuring the protestor who has become known as Tank Man, was taken in the Beijing Square during the infamous massacre in June 1989. Students and intellectuals protested communist rule for seven weeks in the square in 1989 in the face of a brutal security crackdown. Roughly 100,000 people are believed to have taken part in the protests - with up to 3,000 of those killed during the demonstrations. Protest song: The image was flashed up on stage during a performance of the Michael Jackson song They Don't Care About Us, pictured, during which a selection of protest images are shown . The Chinese Government considers the peaceful protest to have been a 'counter-revolutionary' revolt, and has previously defended the decision to send in tanks and troops. It has never provided an official death toll. Last month authorities in the country banned the phrase 'big yellow duck' as an internet search term after a prankster doctored the famous Tank Man image and replaced the tanks with giant ducks. The ban was part of an annual crackdown on efforts by families to commemorate the massacre. A number of internet search terms, including 'tomorrow', 'today', 'tonight' and 'June 4' were also banned.","The image was shown to an audience of 15,000 in a Beijing theatre .

The owners of an organic farm which was raided by armed police who claimed that they were searching for marijuana but found nothing but crops are demanding an official apology. Residents at the self-sufficient Garden of Eden farm in Arlington, Texas, were held at gunpoint by a heavy-handed SWAT team for half an hour. One of the eight adults, who were all handcuffed during the raid, was separated from her children, one of whom is a two week old baby. Armed raid: Police pictured raiding the Garden of Eden farm in Arlington, Texas, with a warrant to search for marijuana . Justification: Police had a search warrant to search for marijuana as well as a second one to do with a series of code violations . But they claim that the real reason for the dramatic raid was an attempt to enforce authority code breaches that included the grass being too tall and bushes growing too close to the street. Officers found no marijuana plants at the farm, but code enforcement officers seized 17 blackberry bushes, 15 okra plants, 14 tomatillo plants, native grasses and sunflowers. In all they confiscated $21,000 of goods, including tyres filled with stagnant waters, a move that residents at the farm say has taken away their self-sufficient lifestyle. Farm owner Shellie Smith said that police didn't produce a warrant for two hours after the start of the raid and when they did, one warrant was produced to search for marijuana plants and another for a number of code violations. The farm owners have been locked in a dispute with the city of Arlington since February over the code violations which included a couch and piano in the yard, chopped wood that was not stacked properly and a piece of siding that was missing from the side of the house. Angry: Farm owner Shellie Smith claims that she and the other residents were targeted by the system because they are trying to teach people to live without the system . Damage: Ms Smith fixes a gate that was broken by police during the raid . But the owners say that the code violates their right to live 'freely and sustainably'. In a statement released following the raid, Ms Smith said: 'We have been targeted by the system because we are showing people how to live without it. 'We are growing more than just tomatoes here, we are growing the consciousness that will allow people to live freely and sustainably, and the system doesn’t want that to be known.' The only person to be arrested during the raid was resident Quinn Eaker - who was taken to jail for an outstanding traffic violation. Innocent: Police found no cannabis plants on the site, but a number of other crops were confiscated and taken away . Seizing goods: Code enforcement officers confiscated $21,000 worth of goods from the farm . He told television station WFAA8: 'I think every single right we have was violated, every single one.' The police say that they handled the raid with 'dignity, professionalism and respect'. A City of Arlington spokesman meanwhile told the television station that the purpose of the raid was to 'improve the quality of life, to resolve life safety issues within neighbourhoods and to hold the property owner responsible for creating blight conditions on their property'. The raid on the Garden of Eden is the latest in a series of incidents where armed police have been drafted in to deal with relatively small scale offences. Recent years have seen an Atlanta gay bar raided by SWAT teams after allegations that customers and staff were having public sex and to perform license inspections at Orlando, Florida, barbershops.","The Garden of Eden farm in Arlington, Texas, was searched for 10 hours .

A couple have been convicted of stealing the life savings of an . elderly dementia sufferer to buy themselves a new car, a home gym and wet room in a two-year spending spree. Lesley Reeve, 56, and husband Andrew, 55, spent all but £3,000 of her godmother Joan Killen’s £130,000 savings after the pensioner was moved into care and allowed him to become a signatory on her bank accounts. The couple cleared debts, bought a car and spent thousands on electrical goods and presents for themselves, Teesside Crown Court has heard. Found guilty: Andrew and Lesley Reeve, pictured outside Teesside Crown Court, have been found guilty of stealing the savings of of a dementia sufferer . They also spent some of the cash on converting the garage of their home in Chichester Close, Hartlepool, into a wet room and gym. But the couple were caught out when police launched an investigation after Miss Skillen's care home realised the pensioner was always short of money. When . the couple were arrested last year, they claimed the garage conversion on their . four-bedroom property had been carried out so that the pensioner, who had been placed in care in 2009, could . move in with them when she recovered. But a planning application submitted to the council detailed installing a gym and a wet room – and made no mention of a bedroom. The pair maintained throughout their trial that Miss Killen was 'ecstatic' when they asked her to move . in -  claiming she had told them to spend her money how they liked. That story was rejected by a jury, . who convicted them of stealing £95,000 in savings as well as the theft of rent . money they made from getting a tenant to move into Miss Killen's property when she . went into a care home after a fall. An unemployed oil company receptionist Mrs Reeve, who collapsed in the dock, was convicted of stealing £2,940 in pension payments.The couple were cleared of stealing a winter fuel payment of £150. Building work: The home where the Reeve couple built a home gym and wet room with the pensioner's money . While . they were spending up to £2,500 of the godmother’s savings a week at . one point in 2009, the Reeves, who have sons aged 27 and 24, were . sending her a weekly allowance of just £9.13 when she was in the care . home, the court heard. Their sons sobbed in the public gallery when the guilty verdicts were returned. The court heard how the pair, from Hartlepool, took over Mrs Killen’s finances when the spinster was taken into a care home in 2009 with dementia. Prosecutor . Matthew Bean told the jury how Mrs Killen was left without pocket . money while her goddaughter and her husband spent her savings . within just two years. More . than £11,000 went on paying off Mrs Reeve’s credit card bill while the . couple also bought a car, revamped their £220,000 detached home and . added new furniture. The court was told how the couple spent money at Next, Marks and Spencer and Argos. Opening . the case, barrister Mr Bean told the jury: ‘The prosecution say that . this money was taken from her account in order for them to spend it on . themselves. 'The . prosecution say the money was used to pay for the conversion at their . house... and also used by the defendants to buy a car, furnishings . and electrical equipment. ‘We ask you to look at this woman’s mental health. ‘It shows she was vulnerable and suffering from a gradual deterioration in her capacity due to the onset of dementia. 'Taking advantage': There was regular spending . by the couple at Next (left), Marks & Spencer (right, both file . pictures) and Argos, funded by Miss Killen, the court was told . Case: The couple went on trial at Teesside Crown Court (pictured) of . stealing from Joan Killen's savings after Mr Reeve became . a co-signatory for her accounts when her mental health began to . deteriorate . ‘The . prosecution say both defendants must have been well aware of this and . decided to take advantage of her vulnerability by taking and spending . her life savings.’ The . court heard that Mrs Killen had ‘substantial’ savings of more than . £130,000 in January 2009, but within two years there was just over . £3,000 left in her accounts. Hartlepool council . officials launched an investigation after realising the care home . resident was often left without pocket money and did not have enough to . meet her bills. Mr Reeve . twice ignored letters to provide detailed bank statements, said Mr Bean, . because he knew there was little left and the discovery of that could . lead to police involvement. Soon . after, small amounts of money were transferred back into the . pensioner’s accounts in a cynical attempt to hide the thefts, the . prosecutor said. Leaving court: The couple were released on bail until their sentencing hearing . After their arrests, the couple denied . acting dishonestly and claimed they had been given permission by the . woman to spend the money. Mr . Bean said their victim had no close relatives visiting her and although . her goddaughter was not a blood relative, she and her husband were in . line to inherit almost all of her possessions anyway. But . he told the jury it was ‘no coincidence’ that transfers back into the . godmother’s account began only after the Reeves were told of the council . investigation. The court . also heard that within weeks of the woman being taken into temporary . care, her home was stripped of a stairlift and warden alarms despite Mr . Reeve being told she may return. The . house was then let by the couple who had the rent and payment for . utility bills paid directly into their accounts along with the elderly . woman’s pension and winter fuel allowance. The . Recorder of Middlesbrough Judge Simon Bourne-Arton granted the couple . bail to allow reports to be prepared ahead of sentencing. After the case, Detective Inspector Dave Turnbull from the Cleveland Police Economic Crime Unit said: 'Today's result has brought a satisfactory conclusion to the first stage of what has proven to be a very difficult investigation. 'As the victim was unable to give evidence, it had to be proved by other means and credit for this must go to the investigating officer, Detective Constable Rachel Graham. 'Mr and Mrs Reeve took full advantage of a vulnerable lady and have spent her money entirely for their own benefit, which has left the victim with little left. 'We will now commence an investigation to recover the proceeds of the crime.' A council spokesman said: 'Hartlepool Council is committed to protecting vulnerable people in the local community, and this includes the identification of financial and property abuse. 'Our staff have worked extremely hard on this case and welcome today's verdict.'","Lesley Reeve, 56, and husband Andrew, 55, .

A massive multimillion degree gas cloud has been discovered in a galaxy 60 million light years from Earth. The cloud is likely to have been caused by a huge drawn-out collision between a dwarf galaxy and a much larger galaxy - and this collision could continue for another 50 million years. If this is confirmed, it will be the first time such a collision has been detected in X-rays, and could help unlock the secrets of how galaxies grow. An image combining X-rays and optical light shows the scene of this collision. The impact between the dwarf galaxy and the spiral galaxy caused a shock wave - akin to a sonic boom on Earth - that generated hot gas with a temperature of about 6 million degrees . The impact between the dwarf galaxy and the spiral galaxy caused a shock wave - similar to a sonic boom on Earth - that generated hot gas with a temperature of about six million degrees. The observations, made using Nasa's Chandra X-ray Observatory, show the hot gas has a comet-like appearance, caused by the motion of the dwarf galaxy. Astronomers believe star formation may have been triggered by the shock wave, producing bright, massive stars. Earlier this week, Nasa detected in X-rays a planet outside our solar system pass in front of its parent star. The . image was taken of a planet in HD 189733- a system which is 63 . light-years from Earth - using  Chandra and the . European Space Agency’s XMM Newton Observatory. Up . until now, exoplanets had only been observed passing in front of their . parent stars using optical light in a process known as transiting. The . planet, known as HD 189733b, is a hot Jupiter, meaning it is similar in . size to Jupiter in our solar system but in very close orbit around its . star.It is more than 30 times closer to its star than Earth is to the sun and orbits its star once every 2.2 days. The observations, made using Nasa's Chandra X-ray Observatory (pictured), could be the first time such a collision has been detected in X-rays . The mass of the entire gas cloud is unknown because the two dimensional image can’t show whether the hot gas is concentrated in a thin pancake or distributed over a large, spherical region. The X-ray image shows the hot gas has a comet-like appearance, caused by the motion of the dwarf galaxy . If the gas is a pancake, the mass is equivalent to forty thousand suns. If it is spread out uniformly, the mass could be much larger, about three million times as massive as the sun. According to Nasa, the hot gas should continue to glow in X-rays for tens to hundreds of millions of years. They believe searching for large regions of hot gas in galaxies might be a way to estimate the frequency of collisions with dwarf galaxies and to understand how important such events are to galaxy growth. An alternative explanation is that the hot gas cloud could have been produced by supernovas and hot winds from large numbers of massive stars. However, Nasa claims this is unlikely because of the lack of evidence of expected radio, infrared, or optical features. Optical data from the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope reveals the spiral galaxy in blue and white .","Potential collision was discovered in a galaxy 60 million light years away .

A survey has examined the shopping habits of those who are considering an extra-marital affair. It found that the number one supermarket for such men is Waitrose, while for women it is Sainsbury’s. Tesco, Asda and the Co-op also featured prominently. The survey of those seeking love amid the chiller cabinets and vegetable displays was conducted by a dating website. Checking out on their vows: Cheaters admitted the weekly food shop was a prime opportunity to meet a new lover (posed by models) Both sexes agreed that Iceland was the store where they were least likely to seek a new flame. Dating website IllicitEncounters.com quizzed their 800,000 members to find out more about their shopping and cheating habits. Mike Taylor, a spokesman for the website said the choice of supermarket reflects the kind of bed mate the cheating spouses are after. Affair giveaway: Those cheating go for healthier foods and 'best' ranges . He said: 'Men see Waitrose as the quality . choice for food shopping, whilst women see Sainsbury's as an ideal . combination of both quality and value for money.'

The number of workers aged over 50 has hit record levels, with two million more in jobs than just 15 years ago. It is estimated that by 2020 a third of the workforce will be over 50 as people remain in good health and live longer. Ministers say older workers have a wealth of skills that are key to strengthening the economy and have told businesses to do more to retain them. Mature workers: The number of employees aged 50 to 64 has reached 7.7 million . However, charities say the increasing retirement age, family breakdown and cuts to pension schemes have forced some older people to stay in work longer than they had planned. Figures from the Department for Work and Pensions show the number of people aged 50 to 64 in employment has reached 7.7million – even higher than before the recession. While the number in this age group will have risen, the proportion in work is believed to be higher than at any time before. Pensions minister Steve Webb said: ‘Older workers are not only essential in meeting the long-term demand for labour in our country, they are also an opportunity to add value to business and drive our economy forward. ‘Far from blocking jobs for younger workers, the over-fifties can help to mentor and develop new recruits and apprentices and maximise productivity across the workforce.’ Since October 2011 no employee can be asked to leave a job simply because they have reached the age of 65, which means they can work into their 70s and beyond. Balancing the books: Cuts to pension schemes are forced some older people to stay in work longer than they planned . Employers were warned by the DWP earlier . this year that they must hire more mature staff as Britain is ‘running . out of workers’ ,with 13.5million vacancies predicted in the next decade . – but only seven million young people due to leave education. Ministers believe the gap can be filled by older people. Around 22 per cent of people are aged over 60, but by 2035 it is expected to rise to 28 per cent. The figures out yesterday showed the average age at which men leave work has risen from 63.1 in 1993 to 64.8 today. For women it is up from 60.9 to 62.6. Fading dream: Many more over 50s and 60s are having to put back their retirement plans . For men and women the state pension age will rise to 66 by 2020, and to 67 as soon as 2025 – a decade earlier than planned. A government guide issued to employers says: ‘Older people are the main untapped source of labour: unlike migrants, they already live here, and their numbers are growing.’ Michelle Mitchell, of the charity Age UK, said a number of factors explain the rising number of older workers, including lifestyle, finances and marital status. She added: ‘It is great to see more people aged 50-plus in the workforce. Older people have a wealth of experience and skills which contributes significantly to businesses and the economy.’ A recent survey found 14 per cent of people did not know when they would ever be able to retire, with those aged 65 and over not expecting to give up work until the age of 71. But Mr Webb insisted he did not want to promote a culture of ‘work till you drop’. He said: ‘This is actually enabling people to carry on and in most cases that is good for their wellbeing as well.’ Tests . by the Max Planck Institute in Berlin on more than 200 workers found . those aged over 65 performed better than those in their 20s in speed and . memory exercises, and their work was more consistent with fewer ‘bad . days’ at the office. McDonald’s, . which employs more than 1,000 staff aged over 60, reported 20 per cent . higher performance at restaurants with older workers.","By 2020 a third of the workforce will be over 50 .

With a twisted and tilted body, England’s oldest smock mill was about to fall down after three proud centuries of displaying its industrial strength. But thanks to a 15-year restoration effort led by the bouncing bomb inventor's son, the Lacey Green Windmill in Buckinghamshire is back to its best. The mill was falling down in the 1970s when a team of volunteers decided to return it to its former glory, which prompted a mammoth restoration effort. Scroll down for video .

Workings: Millstones for grinding grain are seen at the Lacey Green Windmill near Princes Risbourgh, Buckinghamshire. It is England's oldest working smock windmill . This work to restore the mill - which stands halfway between High Wycombe and Aylesbury - was led from 1971 by Christopher Wallis, who died in 2006. He was the son of Sir Barnes Neville Wallis, who invented the bouncing bomb used in the Second World War Dambusters raid in Ruhr, Germany, in 1943. Mr Wallis Jr worked on more than 20 windmills and was a British Railways engineer in 1969 when he studied the mill and realised it could still be saved. The first decade of the restoration in the 1970s was spent restoring the mill’s structure, before it could be pulled back to its proper shape. Its eight walls were surrounded with plywood to strengthen the structure with supporting timbers either side. It was then given a layer of weatherboarding. Four new sails were fitted, before the fantail was added - a mechanism to drive the gearing that ensures the main sails always face into the wind.

Almost a third of consumers said they would be interested in using the gadget to access in-store promotions and be guided where to find the bargains in a shop. Venda, a company that looks after Tesco’s eCommerce solutions, claims wearable technology could ‘revitalise’ tired shops by encouraging consumers to make impulse purchases. Almost a third of consumers said they would be interested in using Google Glass to access in-store promotions and be guided where to find the bargains in a shop, according to an eCommerce company called Venda . Google Glass - high tech glasses that allow wearers to find information and take photos - is not yet available to UK consumers but 28 per cent of consumers would use the wearable technology to access in-store promotions, according to a poll of 2,000 UK adults. The study found 45 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds would use the technology to search for available stock and product ideas to purchase while in store. Venda believes Google Glass and other . highly-anticipated wearable devices like Apple and Samsung's watches, . have the ability to encourage consumers to buy more products in physical . shops. It said: 'More than one in five consumers said they would like to be able to unlock additional offers and promotions, via digital screens such as billboards or store window displays, highlighting Google Glass’s ability to harness impulse buys through instant offers.' Eric Abensur, Group CEO of Venda,said: 'Wearable technology has been identified as a...driving force for the high street's renaissance...and has the potential to help both consumers and retailers' Consumers are increasingly using their smartphones when browsing shops to check that products are not cheaper elsewhere and the trend will probably become more popular if consumers embrace Google Glass. The study found any moves by retailers to prevent the use of this technology in-store will be negatively received by consumers. Over half of people surveyed thought that if shops did complain about them using the technology, they would conclude the retailers probably have something to hide, including higher prices and negative reviews. The results suggest that retailers should embrace the adoption of Google Glass.

Jan Brewer for help after she was told she and her unborn child do not qualify for full survivors benefits. Roxanne Warneke lost her Marine veteran husband Billy, 25, to the fire that overcame Yarnell Hill and killed 19 Granite Mountain Hotshot firefighters, who worked for the city of Prescott. But Mrs Warneke, whose daughter is due in December, has been told that she does not qualify for full health benefits because her husband, who had only worked with the Hotshots for three months before he died, was only a seasonal employee. All 19 Hotshot families will receive worker's compensation and a federal payment of $328,000, but 13 families do not qualify for the full health benefits or lifetime salaries, which are worth thousands. Fight: Roxanne Warneke, whose husband Billy died in the Yarnell Hill fire on June 30, has pleaded to Gov. Jan Brewer for her help in securing full health benefits for all of the families left bereaved . Mrs Warneke has argued that her husband lost his life protecting the town and its residents, and that the city should pay out fully to any responder who dies on state land. 'They all deserve equal treatment because . they all made the same ultimate sacrifice,' Mrs Warneke said at a press . conference on Wednesday. In a letter to the governor, she said she is worried about health care coverage for her and her child. 'Billy was thrilled to work alongside the best of the best – and he was determined to do whatever he could do to be among the best of that supremely talented crew,' she wrote. Missed: Billy Warneke had been fighting fires with the Hotshots for just three months before he died . Torn apart: The couple had been married for four years and their first daughter is due in December . She said that by failing to receive . the same pension benefits or health insurance as the permanent . employees, 'the difference is substantial, hundreds of thousands of . dollars over the course of a lifetime'. The city has argued that it is legally . prohibited from reclassifying seasonal employees as full-time . employees after their deaths. They said they cannot give . full benefits even if they want to. Arizona . House Speaker Andy Tobin, whose district includes Prescott, said he is . working on legislation to resolve the issues, the Arizona Republic . reported. He said that men . or women who put themselves in danger to protect the larger community . should be assured that their families will be cared for if they die, . Tobin said. The governor has received Warneke’s letter, and wants to see the issue resolved a spokeswoman said on Friday, NBC News reported. Flames: 19 men perished in the fire. One of the firefighters sent this image to his wife the day they died . Killer: The fire destroyed hundreds of homes and was eventually put out 10 days after the deaths . She 'shares in the frustration felt by her and the other families of the firefighters tragically killed in the Yarnell Hill Fire,' spokeswoman Ann Dockendorff said in an email. 'There are numerous legal, policy, and . fiscal questions that must be considered... Because this issue is so . important, it's critical that policymakers get it right.' The . fight comes after another widow, Juliann Ashcraft, said she is . considering suing the City of Prescott for the benefits and salary that . her husband Andrew was receiving before he died. Mrs Ashcraft said she was relying on . the income to raise the couple's four young children - and she has . argued that her husband was misclassified as 'seasonal' staff. 'Everyone . says every day will get better and in fact every day gets harder,' Juliann Ashcraft said at a press conference last week. Battle: Juliann Ashcraft, who also lost her husband in the fire, has previously spoken out about how she is not getting proper benefits, although her husband worked full-time for the fire department . Loss: Juliann said losing Andrew, left, means she is struggling to care for their four young children . 'I have four small children that now I've got to find a way to provide for them because my husband giving the ultimate sacrifice, in the city's eyes, wasn't enough to seal the deal that we'll be given health benefits, that we'll be given his salary moving forward,' she said. She has argued that he worked full-time on a full-time salary. 'I said to them, ""My husband was a . full-time employee, he went to work full-time for you,""' she said, 'and . their response to me was, ""Perhaps there was a communication issue in . your marriage.""'

'Now I have four kids and myself, and I don't know what I'm going to do. 'I want to be able to just be mourning my husband, be supporting my children, be figuring out what our new normal is.' The 19 men perished on June 30 as they battled to control the flames ravaging Yarnell Hill. But the highly-skilled team were overcome when a sudden wind change forced the fire in their direction.

Mo Farah laid claim to being Britain’s  greatest ever athlete last night when he became the first Briton to win both long  distance titles at the Olympics and the World Championships. Farah, who added the world 5,000m to the 10,000m title he won last Saturday, knelt down and kissed the ground after crossing the finish line in the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. It is the fifth world or Olympic gold medal for the 30-year-old, after he won the 5,000m and 10,000m at last year’s Olympics and the 5,000m at the World Championships in Daegu in 2011. Scroll down for video . History made: Farah recorded an historic 'double double' holding both 5,000m and 10,000m Olympic and world titles . Top of the world: Farah came through for his third World Championship title . Delight: Farah celebrates after winning the Men's 5,000m final . Farah and American training partner Galen Rupp were the only two athletes attempting both events, with doubts cast over how successful Farah would be after only having six days to recover from the first race. Former middle distance champion Lord Coe said earlier that if Farah won the 5,000m he would be the 'greatest British athlete of all time”. He said: 'If Mo wins the 5,000m then you’d have to say he is the greatest British athlete of all time. He would be ahead of all of us with five global golds. 'I’d say Mo would have no equal in Britain if he goes on to achieve the double following on from his two golds in London. It would be a fantastic achievement.” Ahead of the race, Farah told the British public: 'My message to everyone watching on TV is chill out, make a cup of tea, Mo’s on the track!” Family affair: Gold medalist Mo Farah poses with his daughter Rhianna on the podium during the medal ceremony . On the podium: (Left to right) Silver medalist Hagos Gebrhiwet of Ethiopia, gold medalist Mo Farah and bronze medalist Isiah Kiplangat Koech of Kenya . Sporting legend: Farah has to be considered one of Great Britain's best ever athletes . Following his victory, a clearly elated Farah walked around the track with a Union flag draped over his shoulders before jumping up in the air in excitement. Smiling and waving at fans, he then made his way to where his wife Tania and daughter Rihanna were sitting in the crowd, hugging them both as hundreds of camera bulbs flashed in his face. He told the BBC: 'I never thought in my career I would achieve something like this. 'This is something I’ve worked so hard for. All I was thinking about was my kids and how much I’ve been away from them.” He said he found the race, which saw him stay behind at first before powering to the front in the final laps, a lot harder than the earlier event. 'It was hard,” he said. 'It was a lot more hard work than the last, I put so much hard work into it.”Farah also thanked his team and the public for the support they had given him. 'I had a lot of pressure but, at the same time, I enjoy it,” he said. 'I’m very proud to represent my country and hold the Union Jack.” Support: Mo Farah with his daughter Rhianna and wife Tania on the podium during the medal ceremony for the men's 5000 metres .

Farah became one of the top trending topics on Twitter with many taking to the site to congratulate him. Fellow athlete Jessica Ennis wrote: 'Never in doubt! Another amazing performance! Go @Mo-Farah.” TV presenter Clare Balding tweeted: 'Unbelievable! Mo Farah is just immense.” The Somalia-born long-distance runner won legions of fans with his gutsy performance at London 2012, while his 'Mobot” pose became one of the most memorable images of the Games, with Usain Bolt, Robbie Williams and Boris Johnson among the many famous faces pictured mimicking it. He topped off an eventful year by being made a CBE in the New Year Honours list but missed out on a top three position in the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards, having to settle for fourth place behind winner Bradley Wiggins, Jessica Ennis and Andy Murray. Held on: Farah looked tired towards the end, but powered through for a momentous victory . Close call: Farah saw off rival Isiah Koech of Kenya after a tight final 150 metres . Farah, who coined the motto 'Go Hard or Go Home”, spent most of his early life in Djibouti and arrived in London when he was eight to join his father. He settled in Hanworth, west London, and began running at school after being spotted by his PE teacher. His story from the poverty-stricken streets of Somalia to top flight athletics is one that serves as an inspiration, both in Britain and his place of birth. His charity - the Mo Farah Foundation - helps to provide life-saving aid to some of the millions of people facing starvation and disease in East Africa. Farah spends most of his time in the United States where he has been able to train away from the spotlight. He currently lives in Portland, Oregon, with his wife Tania and three daughters, Rihanna, Aisha and Amani. Aside from athletics, Farah’s other sporting passion is Arsenal football club.

"By . Guy Adams . PUBLISHED: . 19:25 EST, 26 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:38 EST, 26 August 2013 . Yesterday was a picture-perfect Bank Holiday in the Berkshire village of Cookham. Hundreds of day-trippers took advantage of the summer sunshine to wander along grassy meadows next to a meandering River Thames. On the High Street, just a brisk walk from the historic house where local author Kenneth Grahame wrote The Wind In The Willows, a steady trickle of customers came seeking refreshment at Diane Bryant and Magda Wencel’s newly opened tea shop, the Teapot. As they poured Earl Grey into bone china cups, and carved into magnificent cakes, Diane and Magda’s customers could reflect that they were enjoying a quintessentially English moment on what is rightly regarded as one of the country’s most beautiful High Streets. Victims: Magda Wencel and Diane Bryant opened the cafe only two weeks ago but had someone post 50 exotic cockroaches through their letterbox on Thursday . Unspoiled Cookham is, after all, famed for everything from its 11th-century church to the higgledy-piggledy houses that grace the oil paintings of famous landscape artist Sir Stanley Spencer, a local resident who used to call it his ‘village in heaven’. Yet behind the comforting smell of brewing tea and freshly buttered scones, another, less savoury, aroma could be detected in the airy back room of the Teapot. It was the unsettling whiff of a bizarre and increasingly ugly scandal. Trouble began on Thursday morning, when the owners arrived to discover that no fewer than 50 cockroaches had been posted through their letterbox during the night. The large red insects were crawling around on the floor, making a vigorous hissing sound that one eye-witness has compared to ‘something out of a low-budget horror movie’. Creepy crawlies: Magda and Diane went to open The Teapot on Cookham High Street on Thursday morning to find the floor covered in insects . The bugs were later collected by police and taken away for tests which have established that they were Madagascan Hissing Cockroaches, an exotic species which can grow up to three inches long. Health officials closed the tea shop for the day, and baffled detectives are now attempting to establish who might be responsible for attempting to sabotage the Teapot. The incident has stunned well-heeled villagers, and left Diane and Magda, in their words, ‘worried and thoroughly disgusted’. ‘It was a terrible, revolting thing to do, and people here just can’t believe someone could do it,’ said Magda, 38, when we met. ‘We can’t blame anyone, or point the finger. We just don’t know who might be responsible. But obviously we want to find out. This wasn’t just some kids messing around. It was a planned attack, by someone who wanted to cause harm.’ The crime has appalled and enthralled the village in equal measure. A string of conspiracy theories are already swirling around Cookham, which sits in London’s commuter belt, has a thriving Horticultural Society and, according to the Land Registry, is the second most wealthy village in the country. ‘It’s Midsomer Murders, with cockroaches in place of a corpse,’ declared one drinker, darkly, at the village’s Kings Arms pub, a hostelry occasionally frequented by such celebrated locals as rugby coach Sir Clive Woodward, singer Chris Rea, Rolf Harris and TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson. Saving grace: It was fortunate that the 50 roaches were Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches as they are easier to get rid of . Like many residents of this tight-knit community, my informant was reluctant to give his name in connection with the incident. But he was also happy to outline at some length several exotic theories regarding the Madagascan cockroaches, which are prized by pet owners for their habit of hissing noisily when disturbed. He, and several other interviewees, took the view that the bugs were planted by someone loyal to a rival business. They pointed out that the lucrative trade in providing tea and coffee to day-trippers in Cookham has hitherto been dominated by three or four nearby village pubs, along with a single coffee shop, Infusions, which is situated directly next door to the Teapot. But there is no evidence to support such claims. Indeed, when I visited Infusions, the manageress, who also declined to give her name, said she had ‘no comment’ to make about the cockroach incident, but added, pointedly, that she would ‘never have anything to do’ with any such attack. ‘I can’t stand cockroaches. They give me the heebie-jeebies,’ she said. ‘I can’t go near them. I saw them at the zoo once, when I visited with my children, and was too scared to even go near their tank. I would certainly never touch them.’ A second popular theory regarding this unsolved ‘whodunnit’ revolves around the fact that Magda Wencel hails originally from Poland. Could racism be a motive? I found nothing to support this theory, although Cookham certainly has form when it comes to taking issue with exotic incomers. A few years ago, when it was reported that rock-star Liam Gallagher had brought a house just outside the village, locals held a meeting at the Jolly Farmer pub to raise fears about the former Oasis singer and his urbanite friends lowering the tone of the community. Criminal activity: Police are investigating incident but have yet to find the culprit . Yesterday, locals were at pains to describe the village as a tolerant place which welcomes outsiders. And Diane Bryant said that she has experienced ‘nothing but goodwill’ since arriving in Cookham. ‘A lot of people have been coming in saying how awful the incident is, how sorry they are, and staying for a cup of tea,’ she said. A third theory posits the idea that the attack was the work of a homophobe who might have leapt to the conclusion that Bryant and Wencel are domestic, as well as business, partners. This thesis, aired in online forums over the weekend, was presumably inspired by Cookham’s last brush with infamy, in 2010, when a churchgoing local couple, who run a B&B, were prosecuted for refusing to allow two gay men to stay at their residence. Yet it must be discounted because both women are in happy, heterosexual relationships. Diane has a husband and a young daughter, while Magda lives with her fiancé in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. ‘That theory is very funny, but we’re business partners and nothing else,’ Magda said. ‘Not that it matters in this day and age, of course.’ The police investigation continues but, as yet, has made little progress. I understand that no fingerprints were found on the Teapot’s letterbox, and footage from CCTV cameras at either end of the High Street shows no more than a blurry image of individuals walking past the tea shop after dark, which is when the attack happened. Inquiries at local pet shops — including one in Maidenhead, about four miles away — have drawn a blank, since none is believed to stock Madagascan Hissing Cockroaches. The insects are, however, widely available over the internet, and police are working on the assumption that they were purchased online and shipped to the attacker via mail order. Whoever the cockcroach culprit was, and however well their tracks were covered, he or she also appears to have made at least one big mistake. ‘The pest control guy who visited the shop after the attack said we’d been very lucky that they had used this type of cockroach, because the insects all stayed in a relatively small area by the door,’ says Magda. ‘If they had been normal cockroaches it would have been different. Within a short time they would have been all over the shop and we would probably have been closed for days.’ Did the mysterious attacker make other crucial errors that will eventually see them unmasked? As with any high-profile, unsolved crime, only time will tell. In the meantime, sinister conspiracy theories will continue to flourish in this outwardly idyllic corner of rural England.","Newly opened Cookham tea shop victim of cruel sabotage .

The Republican party decided on Friday to boycott any 2016 presidential debates sponsored by CNN and NBC if the networks go ahead with plans to make special programs on Hillary Clinton, who is widely expected to seek the Democratic nomination. Delegates to a meeting of the Republican National Committee voted for a resolution including the boycott and said the programs would be 'little more than extended commercials promoting former Secretary Clinton.' The RNC also resolved that it would require that any future debates have 'appropriate moderators and debate partners.' Chairman of the Republican National Committee Reince Priebus, center, introduces a panel of RNC 'Rising Stars' on Thursday . Delegates approved the motion by a unanimous voice vote. Republican leaders last week sent letters of protest to both networks complaining that a planned CNN documentary and an NBC miniseries amount to political ads for the former secretary of state and wife of former President Bill Clinton. She has not confirmed whether she is running. The vote came on the last day of a three-day gathering called 'Making it Happen,' at which Republicans discussed ways to use technology and other means to connect with a wider range of voters, following Mitt Romney's failure to unseat incumbent Democratic President Barack Obama in last November's election. CNN officials have said their documentary, due to appear in theaters and on television in 2014, is not yet complete, while NBC said its mini-series is being produced by an entertainment unit, which is independent of the news division. The RNC posted this to its website GOP.org, after voting on the resolution . In preparation for the next presidential . election, RNC Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the party would . consider holding its 2016 nominating convention in June or July, rather . than August, to reduce the amount of time Republican candidates spend . competing against one another to win the nomination. An earlier . convention also would allow the Republican nominee to focus on the . Democratic opponent. 'A network that spends millions of dollars to spotlight Hillary Clinton, that's a network with an obvious bias and that's a network that won't be hosting a single Republican primary debate,' Priebus said on Friday. 'We're done putting up with this nonsense ... The media overplayed their hand this time.' A Democratic Party spokesman said the move would only limit Republicans' ability to reach more voters. 'If they truly want to connect with a broader audience, they need an agenda that fights for the middle class and is inclusive,' said Michael Czin, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. 'Sadly, it appears that with today's vote, their approach is to actually speak to even fewer voters.' New Hampshire state Rep. Marilinda Garcia, second from right, speaks during the Republican National Committee summer meeting Thursday . New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, seen as a likely 2016 Republican contender for the White House, addressed the meeting in a closed-door session Thursday. Clinton, the former U.S. senator from New York, ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in 2008, losing to Obama, but Republicans at the Boston meeting clearly saw her as a threat. Republicans are holding their regular summer meeting in a Boston hotel next door to the convention center where Romney delivered his election night concession speech nine months ago. They moved the meeting, originally due to be held in Chicago, to Boston as a show of support after the April 15 bombing of the city's marathon.","Republican National Committee delegates voted for the boycott and said the programs would be 'little .

Discrete: The drive-in sex booths will open to the public on August 26 in an effort to improve prostitutes' working conditions . Workplace: The boxes in Zurich will allow prostitutes to conduct their business in more privacy . Customers will cruise past a line of 40 prostitutes before selecting one and negotiating a fee. They will then drive into one of the wooden sheds, which are hung with safe sex posters. The boxes are equipped with panic alarms which can be activated if the clients or prostitutes feel in any danger. The sex workers will have to register with a health insurer and buy a 'work ticket' each night for £3.50 . each night that they work. Prostitution in Zurich will be confined to the booths and two other zones after they open. This is intended to curb the large numbers of prostitutes working in residential areas and in the city centre.

The family of a boy who killed himself after he was lured into a cyber blackmail plot have called for action against ‘poisonous’ social networking sites. Daniel Perry, 17, was targeted by a gang who threatened to send compromising images of him to his family and friends unless he paid them. He was also targeted by trolls on the controversial social networking site, Ask.fm, who urged him to kill himself in a disturbing echo of a recent spate of suicides by young people. Blackmailed: Teenager Daniel Perry killed himself after he was trapped in an online blackmail plot . The apprentice mechanic jumped from the Forth Road Bridge in Scotland less than an hour after the gang told him he would be ‘better off dead’ if he did not comply. Yesterday, his heartbroken mother said she was horrified by what had happened. His family demanded that Ask.fm be shut down and urged David Cameron to take action. Daniel’s ex-girlfriend said that social networking sites such as Ask.fm were ‘poisonous’. The Latvia-based website has been linked to the deaths of four teenagers, including 14-year-old Hannah Smith from Leicestershire. One anonymous tormentor told Daniel: ‘Kill yourself mate’, while another posted, ‘Please kill yourself’. A further message read: ‘You need to let a blade meet your throat.’ Daniel Perry was targeted by online blackmailers who told him they would hand a video to police of his chat with who he thought was a girl of his own age . Yesterday, his family revealed the teenager thought he had been speaking to a pretty girl his own age from Illinois. They say one of the gang pretended to be the girl during months of flirting. They then believe the gang used stolen images for a short video exchange during which they secured compromising images of Daniel. It is believed to be a typed conversation on Skype with pictures being sent between the pair, according to a family member. The images of the girl are likely to have been stolen and the footage of Daniel recorded afterwards. It is not believed a live exchange took place. The gang then revealed themselves in a menacing call also via Skype. They threatened to show the images to his family unless he paid up. He was targeted by people who it is believed found his Skype address when he tweeted it . Shortly before his death, Daniel asked the blackmailers via his laptop: ‘What can I do to stop you showing this to my family?’ He was told to pay cash into a bank account or his life would not be worth living. He replied simply: ‘Bye’. Daniel died in hospital on July 15. His mother, Nicola Perry, from Dunfermline, Fife, said: ‘They are clever people and I believe he didn’t give them any money, he was just scared and didn’t know what to do. The teenager was an apprentice mechanic in Dunfermline, Fife, where he lived . ‘On the night he died he walked out of his gran’s house at 7.30pm and texted me at 7.45pm to say he would be home soon but he never made it. I’m horrified about what’s happened, I still can’t go into his bedroom and I keep expecting him to walk through the door and say “ha, fooled you”. ‘Parents need to tell their children that nothing is that bad that it is worth taking your life over – anything can be fixed. We need to prevent this happening again.’ His uncle Ron Reilly, 47, said he went to Daniel’s bedroom on the night he died and found his laptop still on, with a picture of the girl on the screen. He added: ‘David Cameron needs to answer the question about web safety. There has to be some way that those people can be reported easily to the police and dealt with accordingly. 'These various websites named recently need to be shut down if they can’t be policed properly. How many other parents have lost their child like this and never known the reasons why? They’re scum – we want the people responsible to be found and prosecuted.’ Yesterday, Daniel’s ex-girlfriend Shannon Hughes, 17, said: ‘What happened to Daniel was horrific and I can’t believe people would write those things on Ask.fm. That is one website I would really like to see taken down – it’s poison.’ A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘We want to help parents and are working with industry to introduce more family-friendly internet filters.’ A spokesman for Skype said: ‘Bullying and harassment of any kind are not welcome on Skype and are taken very seriously. The safety of our users is paramount to us. We ask users to immediately report inappropriate behaviour through the “Report Abuse” button and encourage them to only share their Skype ID with people they already know.’ Daniel died on July 15 after jumping from a bridge just an hour after receiving the threat from the blackmailers .","Daniel Perry believed he started conversation with girl the same age as him .

Abduction victim Hannah Anderson has been seen in public for the first time since she was rescued by federal agents less than a week ago. The 16-year-old wore sunglasses, a blue top and short jean shorts as she attended a fundraiser with friends and supporters in Lakeside, California less than a week after her ordeal ended. It comes as questions remain over what exactly happened when she was kidnapped by James 'Uncle Jim' DiMaggio, a family friend who killed her mother and brother before abducting her and taking her to Idaho where FBI officers shot him dead. Many questions remain about the timeline of events on the day when Christina and Ethan Anderson were killed: why did Hannah exchange 13 calls with DiMaggio in the hours leading up to the attack? How exactly were they killed? And how was DiMaggio able to restrain and kill them without Hannah knowing before they drove off together? Scroll down for video . Hannah Anderson was spotted sneaking into a fundraiser being held for her dead relatives on Thursday . Make way: The 16-year-old was ushered into a back door of the Lakeside, California restaurant where community members had gathered to help raise money for funeral costs . Suddenly silent: Hannah did not speak on Thursday and she has set all of her social media accounts to private . Police have not explained any of these . issues publicly, but they have released the search warrants filled out . by investigators at DiMaggio's house, listing pages of evidence that . they took with them to help piece together his relationship to the . Andersons- and Hannah in particular. San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore has been adamant that Hannah was an unwilling victim from start to finish. ""I can't make it any clearer,"" he said at a news conference Monday. She . has spoken to friends and strangers over social media and released a . number of pictures of herself via her Instagram account but the first . time she was seen publicly came Thursday evening when she went to a . fundraiser for her family. Her . mother Christina and 6-year-old brother Ethan were killed and their . bodies were set on fire by their family friend Jim DiMaggio, who . 'tricked' them into coming to his home and then killed the mother and . brother before running off with Hannah and being shot dead six days . later. Hannah was only briefly seen walking from their car into the back entrance of a San Diego restaurant where the fundraiser was being held. Support: Her father said that she is happy to be home and among friends . Hannah's appearance at the fundraiser comes . the same day as a growing list of evidence recovered at DiMaggio's . house has been revealed, including firebombs, military assault rifle . ammunition, and handwritten 'letters from Hanna' to DiMaggio. One . of the most puzzling pieces added to the ongoing investigation into . this crime is that a DNA test kit was found in the burnt out car that . once belonged to Christina Anderson. NBC News reports . that other items listed in the search warrants released today include . 'crow bars and other weapons, instruments and objects capable of . inflicting blunt force trauma', as well as bomb-making materials like . gas cans, various types of duct tape and arson wire. A . number of personal items that could potentially be used for DNA . collection were also gathered, including clothing and toothbrushes but . also used condoms. The meaning behind the items was not listed, as emergency responders appear to have grabbed as many items as possible on August 5 as they tried to get a better idea of Hannah's relationship with DiMaggio as they were missing. What remained: Firefighters found the bodies of Christina and Ethan Anderson covered with tarp, showing that they were killed before the fire that burnt down Jim DiMaggio's Boulevard cabin (pictured) The 13 calls between DiMaggio and Hannah on the day of her abduction remain curious, though San Diego County sheriff's spokeswoman Jan Caldwell said that they may have been discussing what time she needed to be picked up from cheerleading practice. Today, Hannah . did not make a statement to the awaiting press, but her father Brett . Anderson came outside and made a statement, saying that his daughter was . happy to be home. 'She's with her family and of course with some friends and she's just happy to be here,' he said Thursday. 'Hannah sends her love and she keeps moving day by day.' The fundraiser was largely attended by relatives and friends within their neighborhood, and Mr Anderson cited their strong support as helping them through. 'This is a small community that we're a part of and they really came together... This is how Lakeside rolls,' he said. He also said that he has spoken with the four horseback riders who spotted Hannah in the Idaho woods with DiMaggio and called police. 'It was a chance encounter but it did save my daughter's life,' he said. Father turned spokesman: Brett Anderson stepped outside and said a few words, telling how he was so thankful for the national support that helped lead to his daughter's rescue . Spreading the love: Brett said he spoke with the four horsemen who spotted Hannah with DiMaggio and called police, leading to her recovery . The fundraiser came the day after a search warrant revealed that Hannah's mother and brother were both killed and tortured before DiMaggio's cabin set on fire. A police report that describes the scene that firefighters found when they responded to the call about DiMaggio's cabin being burnt to ashes in Boulevard, California on August 5th. They found the bodies covered with tarp, and a crowbar lying next to Christina. When the responders went to the garage to check for more victims, they found the Anderson's deceased dog and noted that it had blood near its head. The details surrounding the nature of the bodies are scant, but the fact that the humans were draped with tarp before the firefighters got there- and that there was blood coming from the dog's head- implies that they were all killed before the fire ravaged the home.","Abduction victim was seen attending a fundraiser for her family, making it her first  public outing since being freed less than a week ago .

Staff, who were already suspicious, became more concerned  when Amadi, 27, struggled to remember his own address. Fake couple: Nigerian student Chinedu Amadi, 27, and his fake bride Szilvia Basco-Porkolab, 38, pictured being arrested by Home Office investigators in the middle of a sham wedding ceremony at Leicester Registry Office . Caught in the act: A suspicious registrar contacted the Home Office who had investigator lay in wait for the pair to arrive for the sham wedding . Their fears were confirmed three . months later when Amadi arrived for his wedding in January not only an . hour late, but with a different woman. Registrar . Debra Webster, having noticed the mysterious change of bride, told them . their ceremony would have to be postponed because of Amadi’s lateness. And . when the groom returned to the Leicester register office again – on . Valentine’s Day – he was accompanied by a third woman, Hungarian Szilvia . Basco-Porkolab, 38. As . waiting immigration officials swooped to arrest the pair, Amadi said she . looked different because she had previously worn a wig.

Further investigations revealed that Amadi had paid a mystery ‘fixer’ £5,000 to arrange a bogus wedding to an EU national. Basco-Porkolab . had a history of participating in sham weddings. She had previously . married another Nigerian, Ikechukwu Egbe, at Gretna register office in . May last year. Egbe, 33, was later arrested at his Leicester home. Meanwhile .

Officials have been unable to trace the second bride.

Labour would impose rent controls ‘without hesitation’ if it won the next election, its housing spokesman Jack Dromey has been secretly recorded saying. His admission came eight days after Labour’s biggest paymaster the Unite union called for the party to adopt controls on what private landlords can charge. It brought claims that Unite, where Mr Dromey was deputy general secretary until 2010, has ‘bought’ Labour policy. Promises: Jack Dromey, pictured with his wife Harriet Harman, said that Labour would impose rent controls 'without hesitation' if it won in 2015 . Rent controls have been tried by socialist governments, in particular, around the world but have been widely regarded as disastrous. However Mr Dromey, MP for Birmingham Erdington and husband of Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman, said Labour wants to impose rent controls if it wins power in 2015. Addressing a private Labour meeting last month, Mr Dromey admitted that it would be ‘difficult in the 21st century to make traditional rent controls work’ because it would lead to a ‘loss of supply’ of rental homes and ‘deter investment’ by landlords. But he said: ‘Should you have a form of rent control to end ever-spiralling upward rent, particularly here in London, yes without hesitation, yes without hesitation.’ Suspicious words: Mr Dromey's words came just one week after his party's biggest contributors, Unite, had called for the party to adopt controls on private rents . Rent controls are seen as having led to the spread of slum dwellings under socialist regimes in Vietnam and Venezuela. They deter landlords from renting out their properties or from decorating houses that are rented out, leaving tenants with dilapidated accommodation. A minister in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in the 1980s said rent controls there led to poor housing standards and did more damage to Hanoi than American bombs. In Venezuela, rent controls imposed in December 2012 have failed to combat rising inflation which hit 39.6 per cent in June. In New York, rent controls are blamed for reducing the city’s housing supply. Varying degrees of control over rent operated on and off in Britain from the First World War until the 1980s. Official figures show they contributed to the private rented sector shrinking from 55 per cent of households in 1939 to 8 per cent in the late 1980s. Jack Dromey and his wife Harriet Harman own at least two large homes, including one in Herne Hill, South London. But Labour has come under pressure from . Unite, which has given the party £9.2million since Ed Miliband became . leader, to adopt the plans. On July 15 the union’s Twitter feed declared: ‘It’s time for Labour to be bold and commit to introduce rent control for private landlords who are profiteering.’ On July 23 Mr Dromey spoke out at an ‘affordable housing day’ organised by Brent London Borough Council. He said Labour is ‘going through a whole range of options in terms of how you deliver more affordable and predictable rents’ and that the party is looking at ‘traditional rent controls that we once had in this country’. Mr Dromey said an alternative would be to copy the ‘models in Continental Europe where you have longer-term tenancies and indexational rents’. Tory MP Henry Smith said: ‘Labour’s reckless gamble with rent controls would take us back to the 1970s: higher rents, fewer houses, and refurbishment would fall off a cliff. Clearly, Unite are buying Labour’s policy on rent controls.’ A spokesman for Mr Dromey said: ‘We have made it clear we are not talking about traditional rent controls, but a new model that works for both landlords and tenants.’","Jack Dromey was heard saying Labour would cap private rents .

'All we're doing is formalizing an unspoken consensus. We're not saying this general perception is right or even fair. We're just saying it exists,' he said. Despite posting their female peers' photographs and sorority information online, the creators have chosen to remain anonymous - a  choice they didn't grant to the hundreds of young women whose appearances are now being judged. According to a Cornell University spokesperson, the school does not condone the website and is hoping its creators will take it down. Hallowed halls: At the prestigious Ivy League school, young women are being objectified by fraternity brothers, who use their photographs without consent . 'Thankfully, in the past we've found that responsible members of the online community, at Cornell and beyond, are most effective at self-regulating these kinds of sites,' John Carberry, director of press relations, said in an email to the Cornell Sun. 'Let's hope history repeats itself in this case.' The website's creators plan to eventually remove sorority affiliations, then release all their data to show whether users voted more for a woman based on her looks or on her sorority house. It's unclear what the point of having these results would be or at which point the fraternity brothers intend to take the website down. Unimpressed: University officials are hoping the creators of CornellFetch remove the website . For women who want to have their pictures removed from the site, there's an online form, but one of the website's creators told the Huffington Post that it will take time to remove the images. Haillie Crockett, class of 2015, told the Cornell Sun that she found the site to be 'childish, objectifying and completely unnecessary,' after discovering her own picture on the site. 'Anyone who logs on to it is going to think it's about rating people by their looks and chapter affiliation. While a Cornell student will know a few of these people, which will influence their decision, they won't know the majority of them, so the ""winner"" most times will come down to looks,' Crockett said. 'I thought we left ranking popularity in high school.' Crockett said she immediately emailed the website to request her picture be removed from the site. Gauging from reactions, it looks like the anonymous fraternity brothers will be just as busy over the coming days removing women's pictures from the site as they are gathering their important data.","Male Cornell University undergraduates have created a website that ranks their female peers .

"By . Chris Brooke and Andy Dolan . PUBLISHED: . 17:43 EST, 16 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:30 EST, 16 August 2013 . Victim: Jo Hamilton, 56, pleaded guilty to fraud as she feared going to jail . Dozens of men and women running small post offices may have been wrongly taken to court and even jailed over losses caused by a faulty computer system, it has been claimed. Sub-postmasters have been prosecuted or forced to hand over their life savings after being blamed for ‘losses’ identified by a computer system. One of these, postmistress Jo Hamilton, 56, was charged with false accounting of £36,000 when a Post Office audit showed a shortfall at her sub-post office in her shop in South Warnborough, South Hampshire. They claim to be baffled by the discrepancies – sometimes running into many thousands of pounds – between what the computer claimed they should have in their tills and their actual takings for the day. But for years, they say, bosses refused to listen, denying anything was wrong with the IT system, and were ruthless in calling in police. At least three sub-postmasters have been jailed over the losses, while dozens of others have had to remortgage their homes or give their life savings to the Post Office to avoid prosecution. But last month an independent  review, ordered following pressure by MPs, revealed ‘defects’ and training failures in the system used to record all transactions in 11,500 branches nationwide. Following the publication of the critical report, the company has suddenly dropped three separate prosecutions over the last two weeks. Next week the Post Office will announce a review into the cases, and is expected to start talks on possible compensation for those wrongly accused. Some 130 sub-postmasters have lodged formal complaints. Lawyers say the losses amount to millions and that the Post Office could be inundated with claims. Ian Bates, who is negotiating with the company on behalf of the postmasters, said their treatment had been ‘scandalous’. ‘This has ruined people’s lives,’ he said. ‘No one has had the resources to take on the Post Office. I hope now the truth will come out and justice can be done.’ The problems began to emerge after the Horizon IT system was introduced in 2000. Sub-postmasters began to report that their systems were indicating losses which did not reflect the true amounts of money they had taken during the day. But for years bosses flatly denied there were problems with the system, and sub-postmasters were simply ordered to pay the money back. The situation was made worse by ‘outdated contracts’ which many sub-postmasters were on, which stated that they had to make up any losses themselves. Ms Hamilton was taken to court after a Post Office audit showed a shortfall at her sub-post office in her shop in South Warnborough, South Hampshire . One of those affected was Noel Thomas, 66, a father of three who had devoted his entire working life to the Post Office. He was jailed and made bankrupt after investigators ruled that £48,000 had gone missing from the branch he ran in Gaerwen on Anglesey. Mr Thomas, who joined the Royal Mail at 18, said he had repeatedly raised concerns with bosses over failure to get his books to balance following the introduction of the Horizon system. Rather than risking closing his business by declaring that his till did not balance, he signed off the accounts each week, in the hope that his pleas to superiors for help with the system would eventually lead to the problem being sorted out. But when they sent in auditors, he was stunned to be arrested and accused of false accounting. Jo Hamilton was one of the hundreds of sub-postmasters to have their contracts terminated by the Post Office over allegations of false accounting. Mrs Hamilton, 56, ran  the sub-post office from  her shop in the Hampshire village of South Warnborough. The respected businesswoman was prosecuted after a Post Office audit revealed a £36,000 shortfall at her branch. She insisted that she did not take the money and always  suspected the ‘unfathomable’ computer system was to blame. After she was charged with false accounting in 2008, villagers raised £6,000 to help her pay back the cash. Mrs Hamilton and her husband David, 66, a landscape gardener, re-mortgaged their home to raise the £30,000 balance.  Sixty villagers and friends supported her in court. Yesterday she said she pleaded guilty only because she was so fearful of going to prison if convicted. Mrs Hamilton said the Post Office had also offered to drop a theft allegation if she admitted false accounting and paid the ‘missing’ cash back. The mother of two, who still runs her shop, added: ‘I’m sure I will get justice in the end.’ Mr Thomas was jailed for nine months in December 2006 for false accounting, and served 13 weeks before he was released with an electronic tag. Like several of his colleagues, he admitted that he had  technically committed false accounting offences by making false declarations, because he was unable to explain the shortfalls highlighted by the Horizon system, but he insisted he had never taken any money. ‘Signing off the accounts was where I made a mistake,’ he now admits. ‘But if I didn’t do that, I wouldn’t be opening the next morning. I lost my business and my good name. I lost everything.’ Jacqueline McDonald from Broughton, Lancashire, was jailed for 18 months at Preston Crown Court in 2011 for theft and false accounting relating to £94,000 of ‘missing’ cash. The mother of three admitted putting false figures in the system when the tills did not balance, but says she ‘did not steal one penny’ and is now pursuing a civil claim against the Post Office. Last month’s independent review of the Horizon system, carried out by private firm Second Sight, highlighted ‘defects’ or ‘bugs’ in the software that affected 76 branches. It also identified training failures and said the Post Office had been ‘inadequate’ in supporting sub-postmasters to use the system. Following the publication of the report, three prosecutions which were due to take place this month have been quietly dropped by the Post Office. These include the case of Susan Knight, 58, who ran St Keverne sub-post office in Cornwall. She was accused of false accounting involving £22,500. Her contract was terminated and she handed over more than £20,000 to make up the alleged shortfall by using her life savings and borrowing money. A Post Office spokesman confirmed a working group had been set up to ‘review outstanding cases’. Commenting on the dropped prosecutions, she said: ‘A decision has been made that it is not in the public interest to prosecute.’","Jo Hamilton, 56, was charged with false accounting in 2008 .

Prince Charles has come under attack again after one of Britain's leading architects claimed that he wields a veto over prominent new buildings in London. Richard Rogers, who designed the Millennium Dome and the Pompidou Centre in Paris, described the power held by the Prince of Wales as 'an amazing situation'. The eminent architect's claims come just a week after it emerged that Charles had seconded members of his staff to advise ministers in Government departments. Veto: Prince Charles is consulted about major building projects in London, according to Richard Rogers, right . Lord Rogers told the New Yorker that he had been asked to work on a multi-million-pound development set to be built in Central London. He said he was surprised to have been asked, as he had previously clashed with the Prince over his plans for the Chelsea Barracks site. Charles lobbied the Emir of Qatar, who owns the site and eventually agreed to scrap Lord Rogers' £3billion plan for a modernist complex made of glass and steel. The 80-year-old architect went on to tell the magazine that developers routinely consulted the Prince before launching major projects. 'An amazing situation!', he said. 'But they're into minimising risk - and Prince Charles is a risk.' Scrapped: Lord Rogers' plan for Chelsea Barracks, pictured, was cancelled thanks to the Prince of Wales . Landmark: The 80-year-old architect built the Millennium Dome in Greenwich, now the O2 . Lord Rogers - whose work is currently on display in an exhibition at the Royal Academy - accused Charles of acting in an 'unconstitutional' manner by consulting the Qataris in secret, saying that his alleged influence was 'an abuse of power'. The developers who were due to carry out Lord Rogers' plans for Chelsea Barracks claimed to have lost more than £80million due to the Prince's intervention. Charles first made his traditionalist views on architecture known in 1984, when he described a proposed new wing of the National Gallery as a 'monstrous carbuncle'. He once criticised Lord Rogers' work in inflammatory terms, saying: 'You have to give this much to the Luftwaffe - when it knocked down our buildings, it didn't replace them with anything more offensive than rubble.' However, Clarence House denied that the Prince was asked for his blessing by developers seeking to embark on major projects in London. Exhibition: Lord Rogers' 'Homeshell' installation in the courtyard of the Royal Academy in London . 'Developers do not seek planning approval from the Prince of Wales as planning development approvals lie with local planning authorities,' a spokesman told the Independent. 'If developers choose to send the Prince of Wales information about upcoming developments that is up to them but the Prince does not, and cannot, grant planning permission.' The spokesman added that Charles regularly receives letters from ordinary people 'complaining about developments and planning decisions' due to his well-known interest in architecture. Developments which were scrapped after the Prince publicly opposed them include a planned skyscraper in the City and a modernist opera house in Cardiff. However, Renzo Piano's designs for the Shard skyscraper did come to fruition despite Charles's criticisms. Earlier this week, it emerged that Clarence House aides had been seconded to the Cabinet Office and the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The revelations prompted claims that the Prince could be overstepping his constitutional role by intervening directly in Government decisions.","Richard Rogers expresses surprise at being hired for new London project .

Even as San Diego County Sheriff's Department has ramped up its investigation into the kidnapping of Hannah Anderson, which so far has yielded extensive communication between the 16-year-old and her abductor, officials empathized Friday that the teen is considered a victim. Search warrants made public earlier this week showed that Anderson's letters to Joe DiMaggio - the man suspected to murdering her mother and brother before abducting her - were found at his burned home. On Friday, sheriff's spokeswoman Jan Caldwell reiterated previous statements made by Sheriff Bill Gore, who unequivocally said that Hannah ‘was not a willing participant.’ Scroll down for video . Hannah Anderson was spotted sneaking into a fundraiser being held for her dead relatives on Thursday . Make way: The 16-year-old was ushered into a back door of the Lakeside, California restaurant where community members had gathered to help raise money for funeral costs . Suddenly silent: Hannah did not speak on Thursday and she has set all of her social media accounts to private . ‘As Sheriff Gore said earlier in the week, Hannah is a victim in every sense of the word,’ Caldwell said in an email to the Los Angeles Times. ‘Our follow-up investigation has not changed that sentence.’ On Thursday, Anderson stepped out in public for the first time since she was rescued by federal agents less than a week ago. The . 16-year-old wore sunglasses, a blue top and short jean shorts as she . attended a fundraiser with friends and supporters in Lakeside, . California less than a week after her ordeal ended. It . comes as questions remain over what exactly happened when she was . kidnapped by James 'Uncle Jim' DiMaggio, a family friend who killed her . mother and 8-year-old brother before abducting her and taking her to . Idaho where FBI officers shot him dead. Many . questions remain about the timeline of events on the day when Christina . and Ethan Anderson were killed: why did Hannah exchange 13 calls with . DiMaggio in the hours leading up to the attack? How exactly were they . killed? And how was DiMaggio able to restrain and kill them without . Hannah knowing before they drove off together? Police have not explained any of these . issues publicly, but they have released the search warrants filled out . by investigators at DiMaggio's house, listing pages of evidence that . they took with them to help piece together his relationship to the . Andersons- and Hannah in particular. San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore has been adamant that Hannah was an unwilling victim from start to finish. ""I can't make it any clearer,"" he said at a news conference Monday. She . has spoken to friends and strangers over social media and released a . number of pictures of herself via her Instagram account but the first . time she was seen publicly came Thursday evening when she went to a . fundraiser for her family. Her . mother Christina and 6-year-old brother Ethan were killed and their . bodies were set on fire by their family friend Jim DiMaggio, who . 'tricked' them into coming to his home and then killed the mother and . brother before running off with Hannah and being shot dead six days . later. Hannah was only briefly seen walking from their car into the back entrance of a San Diego restaurant where the fundraiser was being held. Support: Her father said that she is happy to be home and among friends . Hannah's appearance at the fundraiser comes . the same day as a growing list of evidence recovered at DiMaggio's . house has been revealed, including firebombs, military assault rifle . ammunition, and handwritten 'letters from Hanna' to DiMaggio. One . of the most puzzling pieces added to the ongoing investigation into . this crime is that a DNA test kit was found in the burnt out car that . once belonged to Christina Anderson. NBC News reports . that other items listed in the search warrants released today include . 'crow bars and other weapons, instruments and objects capable of . inflicting blunt force trauma', as well as bomb-making materials like . gas cans, various types of duct tape and arson wire. A . number of personal items that could potentially be used for DNA . collection were also gathered, including clothing and toothbrushes but . also used condoms. The meaning behind the items was not listed, as emergency responders appear to have grabbed as many items as possible on August 5 as they tried to get a better idea of Hannah's relationship with DiMaggio as they were missing. What remained: Firefighters found the bodies of Christina and Ethan Anderson covered with tarp, showing that they were killed before the fire that burnt down Jim DiMaggio's Boulevard cabin (pictured) The 13 calls between DiMaggio and Hannah on the day of her abduction remain curious, though San Diego County sheriff's spokeswoman Jan Caldwell said that they may have been discussing what time she needed to be picked up from cheerleading practice. Today, Hannah . did not make a statement to the awaiting press, but her father Brett . Anderson came outside and made a statement, saying that his daughter was . happy to be home. 'She's with her family and of course with some friends and she's just happy to be here,' he said Thursday. 'Hannah sends her love and she keeps moving day by day.' The fundraiser was largely attended by relatives and friends within their neighborhood, and Mr Anderson cited their strong support as helping them through. 'This is a small community that we're a part of and they really came together... This is how Lakeside rolls,' he said. He also said that he has spoken with the four horseback riders who spotted Hannah in the Idaho woods with DiMaggio and called police. 'It was a chance encounter but it did save my daughter's life,' he said. Father turned spokesman: Brett Anderson stepped outside and said a few words, telling how he was so thankful for the national support that helped lead to his daughter's rescue . Spreading the love: Brett said he spoke with the four horsemen who spotted Hannah with DiMaggio and called police, leading to her recovery . The fundraiser came the day after a search warrant revealed that Hannah's mother and brother were both killed and tortured before DiMaggio's cabin set on fire. A police report that describes the scene that firefighters found when they responded to the call about DiMaggio's cabin being burnt to ashes in Boulevard, California on August 5th. They found the bodies covered with tarp, and a crowbar lying next to Christina. When the responders went to the garage to check for more victims, they found the Anderson's deceased dog and noted that it had blood near its head. The details surrounding the nature of the bodies are scant, but the fact that the humans were draped with tarp before the firefighters got there- and that there was blood coming from the dog's head- implies that they were all killed before the fire ravaged the home.","Abduction victim was seen attending a fundraiser for her family, making it her first  public outing since being freed less than a week ago .

Deep sea diver: Matthew Caldwell, 59, who was living in the Philippines, was a member of the Philippine Coast Guard Auxilliary and was widely recognised for his courage . He was among the first to be called upon in August last year when a Piper Seneca plane carrying Mr Robredo crashed in the waters off Masbate. Because of the great depth at which the aircraft was believed to be lying, Mr Caldwell's skills, along with those of two unidentified British divers, were required to search for the wreckage. Local hero: Caldwell joined two British divers in the search and recovery of the body of Interior Secretary Jessie Robredo (pictured), who died when his plane crashed in the waters of Masbate . He had attended a meeting of the coast guard on Thursday night when shortly afterwards he became involved in an argument with a security guard as he and his live-in partner, Miss Jeanelyn Flora, 36, were heading to their home in Las Pinas, five miles south of Manila. According to police the security guard, named as Ericson Elacquio, prevented Mr Caldwell from entering his road because he said the American had not paid monthly dues to the homeowners' association. When the guard continued to refuse to raise a wooden beam blocking the road, Mr Caldwell got out of his Toyota Corolla and tried to raise the barrier himself. It was then, as tempers flared, said Superintendent Samala, that the security guard raised his shotgun and fired it straight into Mr Caldwell's face, killing him instantly. The guard and a companion commandeered a motor cycle and spend off into the night. 'We have launched a major search for him,' said Superintendent Samala. 'We are confident we will find him.' As well as helping to locate the wreckage of the aircraft carrying Mr Robredo, Mr Caldwell had previously been involved in recovering bodies from a sunken wood-hulled passenger ship, the Catalyn B., which collied with a steel-hulled fishing vessel on Christmas Even, 2009.","Matthew Caldwell, 59, was shot by security guard near his home, near Manila .

Spanish Twitter trolls have made death threats against the chief minister of Gibraltar and his family during the row over border controls. Fabian Picardo said he had been abused via the social networking site because of his criticism of the Spanish Government's actions, which have led to long delays at the border with the British Overseas Territory. The chief politician in the enclave of around 29,000 people is the latest figure to be targeted online during the diplomatic row. Family man: Gibraltar Chief Minister Fabian Picardo says his family has received death threats on Twitters, pictured here with wife Julstine Olivero and their son . Conservative MEP Julie Girling, whose South West England constituency includes Gibraltar, has said she was called a 'Nazi' by trolls, who used foul and abusive language, and said she was 'too ugly to visit Spain anyway'. Mr Picardo, who is married to lawyer Justine Olivero, with whom he has a young son, tweets from @FabianPicardo. He said: 'I think social media is a great thing, but it also has a very negative aspect to it, which is people can use the cloak of anonymity to insult people and to say things that reasonable human beings don't say about each other. 'I have had some extreme reactions to things I say. I have even had death threats against my family by Twitter.' Asked where they came from, he said: 'From Spain, in Spanish.' Row: Santa Barbara Beach on the Rock of Gibraltar, the centre of a diplomatic spat between Britain and Spain . Ms Girling said on Wednesday that she had received 'a series of deeply offensive and racist messages' via Twitter and email after suggesting British holidaymakers boycott Spain over the Gibraltar blockade. She said one person, calling himself Javier, wrote: 'You are a Nazi Julie Goering.' Another used racist language to suggest she should holiday in India. She said: 'It may be that to be trolled goes with the job. However, the Spanish Twitter trolls aren't doing their argument any favours by trolling me. 'Their abuse shows they have no argument as they can only resort to the lowest form of language. 'The people of Gibraltar need our support. They will not be bullied by the Spanish Government or by a minority of the Spanish people. Neither will I.' Target: Conservative MEP Julie Girling said she has been bombarded by online abuse after calling for a boycott of Spanish holiday resorts . Economic engine: Fabian Picardo said he is in regular contact with local politicians, who wish to see an end to the stand-off . Spanish people living around Gibraltar support the British territory rather than their own government in the latest row over border controls, its chief minister has claimed. Fabian Picardo said he is in frequent 'fluid' contact with local politicians in La Linea and other areas where the more than 4,000 Spaniards who work in the peninsula live. Blaming the problems on the Government in Madrid, he said locals are supportive of Gibraltar as an 'economic engine' and want to see an easing of the border restrictions. He also warned that the fluctuating blockade could directly impact the already struggling Spanish economy if it goes on too long, with construction jobs that would normally go to Iberian workers being awarded elsewhere. Mr Picardo said: 'I have no contact with Madrid, but I have a lot of fluid contact with mayors in La Linea and others municipalities in the area who are very concerned about the effect the controls being imposed by Madrid could have on the working lives of people who come in and out of Gibraltar every day. 'So often ... the people of Gibraltar and the people of La Linea and San Roque become the whipping boys for what may be happening in Madrid, which might be totally unrelated to us here. 'The municipalities in the area are . hugely supportive of Gibraltar continuing to be an economic engine in . the zone and the free flow of people and goods to and from Gibraltar is . an important aspect of that. 'For example, we expect to be putting up a lot of affordable housing in the next two years, we would bring in a lot of Spanish labour for the purposes of building that housing. 'But of course if they can't get across the frontier we will have to bring in labour from elsewhere.' The Foreign Office is lodging a formal complaint with Spain over the latest 'unacceptable' delays at 'the border with Gibraltar. Border controls: Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has called for a ¿50 charge to be imposed on people travelling between the two terretories . Officials are still considering a legal challenge to Spain over its imposition of additional border controls in the latest diplomatic spat between the two countries over the British Overseas Territory. The Spanish action followed the construction by the Gibraltar authorities of an artificial reef which Madrid claims is designed to ruin fishing in the area. The centre-right Popular Party Government of Mariano Rajoy, which is embroiled in a corruption row, responded by beefing up border controls and suggesting that a €50 (£43.30) fee could be imposed on every vehicle entering or leaving the outpost through its fenced border with Spain. Downing Street has described the controls as 'politically motivated and disproportionate', saying they put Spain at odds with EU laws on the freedom of movement. Mr Picardo said the delays at the border had improved since they were imposed but were still fluctuating between no delays and hold-ups of several hours. A child chess prodigy was among the latest people to be affected, with reports that Spain's under-10 national champion, eight-year-old Maria Eizaguerri, was held up for four hours as she tried to get to a competition in Gibraltar.","Fabian Picardo has received a series of abusive messages via Twitter .

The case of a notorious 1896 Wild West killing may have been solved after an amateur historian found a bullet fired in the shoot out more than 100 years later - and matched it to the gun of one of the men pardoned for the the crime. Mormon sheepherders David Cummins, 22, and John Wilson, 25, were gunned down as they camped in South Hills Idaho during a bitter battle between the herders and local ranchers. The prime suspect in the shooting that rocked the state of Idaho was local gunman 'Diamondfield Jack' Davis - who was convicted of the crime and faced the hangman seven times before finally being pardoned. Eventually two cattle company employees confessed to the crime - and claimed they acted in self defense. Now a bullet fired by one of the gummen more than 100 years ago has been found - and even matched to the gun that fired it in a piece of CSI-style detective work. Smoking gun: Former Representative Max Black holds a .44-caliber Colt pistol found in the Southern Idaho deserts near Rogerson, Idaho, one of several links to the 1896 cattle-sheep war . Dark days: 'Diamondfield Jack' Davis became a national figure after his conviction for being convicted of murdering two sheepmen as part of a running dispute between sheep and cattle owners over access to open federal range . The re-examination of the case began with local lawmaker Max Black's interest 'Diamondfield Jack' Davis - a notorious Idaho outlaw. Davis, a loudmouth local character, was employed by the massive Sparks Harrell Cattle Co. to keep sheepherders off the company's land by harassing and threatening them. A previous confrontation that resulted in the wounding of a sheepherder by Davis made him the prime suspect in Cummins and Wilson's deaths. LouDmouth: According to historical reports, 'Diamondfield Jack' earned his nickname for talking about diamond fields relentlessly . Davis was convicted and sentenced to death, but managed to escape the hangman's noose seven times with the help of his lawyer, James Hawley, until in 1902, he was finally pardoned when two other Sparks Harrell employees confessed to the crime. Speaking to the Idaho Statesman, Black . said, 'My search in history is to find places,' citing places such as . the porch of a Virginia farmhouse where General J.E.B. Stuart lost his . renowned rakishly plumed hat in 1862. 'I couldn’t find anyone who knew exactly where this took place,' Black told the Times-News. 'Then I wondered about the court records.' Black . became fascinated by the case of Diamondfield Jack and the sheepherders . and wanted to see the spot where Cummins and Wilson were shot. Notes in the case reported that a bullet . fired by James Bower, one of the two men who eventually confessed to . the crime (the other, Jeff Gray, admitted to firing the fatal shots), which pierced a saddle that was resting on a sagebrush, had . never been recovered. Bower testified that following the shootout, he lost his firearm, a Colt Frontiersman .44 caliber. Improbably, Black had a feeling the missing bullet could still be lying where it fell all those years ago. With . the help of an engineer friend, Black pored over the case notes and . managed to find the spot he felt certain the shootings had occurred near . Deep Creek in eastern Twin Falls County. Armed with a metal detector, Black searched the area around some likely looking brushes - and came up with a bullet which was confirmed to be from a Colt Frontiersman .44 produced between 1880 and 1905, the exact gun used by Bower. Here, the plot thickens - or rather, thins. Black, following his amazing discovery of the bullet near Deep Creek, was updating his friend, Dan Buchwitz, on his research. Suddenly, for Buchwitz, everything clicked. 'Max,' he said, according to the Idaho Statesman. 'I think I have that gun!' Like a shot: Max Black found the rusted gun that he believes belonged to Bower in the possession of his good friend . Implausibly, Buchwitz had been given Colt Forntiersman .44 as a gift by close friends who had come across it in the Deep Creek area sometime in the 1960s or '70s. The gun had been found unloaded, implying all the bullets had been shot from the barrel before it was lost - or more likely ditched - by Bower. Only 2,100 of the Colt Frontiersman pistols were ever made, making it even more likely this gun belonged to Bower. 'Diamondfield Jack' Davis was eventually acquitted of the crime and went on to strike it rich in Nevada, where he founded several mining towns, but his name was always invariably linked to the infamous murder. He survived a shot to the mouth in a bar fight, was falsely reported killed in the Mexican revolution and finally met his death when he was hit by a cab in Las Vegas in 1949. As for the two admitted killers, they were acquitted for acting in self-defense. After four years of research, Black will publish his findings in the killings in Diamondfield: Finding the Real Jack Davis this summer, and plans to continue to investigate the life of 'Diamondfield Jack' Davis.","A bullet linked to a double murder case from 1896 and the gun it's likely to have come from have been discovered .

Some of Britain's most senior civil servants are having part of their tax bills paid out of public funds - leaving them tens of thousands of pounds better off, it emerged today. Government departments were paying the taxes on perks such as official cars, first class rail travel and rent-free accommodation. One senior Conservative MP expressed surprise at the arrangements, saying they were out of line with what could be expected in the private sector where employees would often pay the bill themselves. Benefits: Some senior Whitehall civil save thousands on perks paid for out of the public purse . But HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) insisted that taxpayers did not lose out as a result of rules which had been in place since the 1970s. According to the Daily Telegraph, officials who have benefited from the system include the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, the head of NHS England, Sir David Nicholson, and the former head of the Serious Fraud Office, Phillippa Williamson. Saving on perks: Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has benefited from the scheme . It said that the effect of the deal was to increase the value of their pay packages by up to £30,000 a year with taxpayers picking up the bill. Sir Jeremy has the use of a chauffeur-driven Toyota Prius which, the paper said, had cost taxpayers £172,100 over the past two years - including a tax bill estimated at more than £49,000. Sir David was said have received benefits worth £320,303 over the last six years, including the cost of a rented flat in London, the use of a chauffeured car and first-class train journeys. Richard Bacon, a Conservative member of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, expressed concern at the arrangements. He said: 'Most taxpayers would be surprised to find that this sort of thing is tax-free. These are out of line with what one would expect from the way people in the private sector are treated. 'Taxpayers are already paying a lot for these people, I don't think they would be expecting to dig into their pocket to pay for the tax on the benefit as well.' HMRC insisted that the arrangements were in order.""We can't discuss individual cases. However, cars provided by an employer that are available for employee use are a benefit in kind for the employee and are taxable. These rules have been in place for 37 years,"" it said in a statement. ""Employers may choose to pay the tax due on the benefit. If so any such payment will constitute an additional benefit - which will also be taxable on the employee. 'This is quite a common practice by employers and is a matter between employer and employee. HMRC makes sure all the tax due is paid.'","Pay packages increased by up to £30,000 a year for senior officials who enjoy first class travel, official cars and rent-free accommodation .

From Zac Efron's flip flop fetish to Jamie Oliver's Jesus sandals, there's no getting away from the mandal' - or men's sandal - which is one of this season's biggest trends. The summery shoes were spotted at Valentino, Vivienne Westwood and Lanvin - among many others - and have since been seen adorning the extremities of most of the A-list. Even Barack Obama is partial to exposing his toes in public. Clearly, sandals - be they flipflops, Birkenstocks, or more delicate, leather-strapped affairs - are a fashion force to be reckoned with. But they are also a sartorial minefield. What about socks? Are hairy toes allowed? Can real men have pedicures? Marc Jacob teams his mandals with patterned pajamas, while Ed Westwick keeps it simple . Len Wiseman accessorises with black nail polish but Matthew McConaughey goes au naturel . Mr Porter Editor-in-chief, Jeremy Langmead, cleared up a few issues in an article for the Times Saturday Magazine. He advises that you 'handle your mandal with care.' Rule number one is no socks, despite attempts by Lanvin - among others - to convince the world that the style beloved by grandads on the beach looks acceptable. 'Black socks, shorts and sandals will make you look like an Austrian Montessori teacher,' revealed Robert Johnston of British GQ in the Times. As Nick Clegg discovered when he was ridiculed for sporting chunky sandals while on holiday earlier this summer, velcro straps and big buckles don't cut it either. Instead, says Langmead, keep them plain and stick to dark colours such as black or brown leather. 'Team with looser rather than tighter trousers,' he adds, ' and avoid any that look orthopaedic.' Zac Efron styles his suit with flip flops . Jamie Oliver opts for an orthopaedic style . Michael Fassbender kicks back in Havaianas . Uh oh! Steve Tyler mixes socks and sandals while singer Seal opts for classic black leather mandals . Finally, while your mandals might be slick, if your feet are less than lovely, it's time to put those toes away. As Langmead puts it: 'There are two fictional characters it's vital you don't emulate: Bilbo Baggins ('Filthy little hobbitses') or hippy Keith from Mike Leigh's 1976 classic Nuts In May.' In short: 'Make sure your feet are in good shape: toenails need to be clean and short, calluses erased, dry skin buffed and excessive hair removed.' So do your man's match up? If not, it might be best to plump for a nice pair of loafers instead.","Marc Jacobs, Steve Tyler, Zac Efron and others wearing them .

NHS staff infected with the Aids virus will be allowed to carry out operations and other invasive procedures for the first time. A ban which has been in place for more than 20 years is to be lifted by the Government, which says it will not put patient safety at risk. The ban was imposed because of fears that if an HIV positive surgeon or dentist cut themselves during certain types of operation, it could result in the patient becoming infected. Scroll down for video . Concerns: The ban was imposed because of fears that if an Aids-infected surgeon or dentist cut themselves during certain types of operation, it could result in the patient becoming infected (file picture) Surgeons, dentists, midwives and nurses with HIV will be able to work normally providing they are taking drugs that eradicate the virus in the bloodstream. In another move, from next year, people will be able to buy HIV self-testing kits that are currently illegal for home use. England’s chief medical officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, said science had moved on and it was time to scrap ‘outdated rules’. She said lifting the operating ban on healthcare staff would bring the UK into line with most other Western countries. An estimated 110 staff working in the NHS would be affected by the change, based on the numbers of Britons with HIV. From next April, anyone with HIV wanting to carry out surgical and dental procedures would have to go on a confidential register and have three-monthly testing to ensure they were complying with treatment. Prof Davies said: ‘We’ve got outdated rules. At the moment we bar totally safe healthcare workers who are on treatment with HIV from performing many surgical treatments, and that includes dentists.’ She said modern anti-retroviral drugs enabled people with HIV to lead normal lives, adding: ‘With effective treatment, they are not infectious.’ The risk to patients was ‘absolutely negligible’. About 100,000 people in the UK are . living with HIV, although experts say a quarter of those infected do not . know it. In 2011, there were 6,000 new diagnoses of HIV in the UK. Prof . Davies said changing the rules would help remove some of the stigma of . the disease and encourage healthcare workers who believed they could be . at risk to get tested because their careers would no longer be on the . line. Although they are . under a professional obligation to get tested in such circumstances, . she admitted ‘a few’ might not do so for fear of the consequences. Lifting the ban: England's chief medical officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, said science had moved on and it was time to scrap 'outdated rules' Under the new rules, healthcare workers with HIV will be allowed to undertake all procedures if they are on effective combination of anti-retroviral drug therapy. They must also have an undetectable viral load of HIV in their system, and must be regularly monitored. Public Health England will set up a confidential register holding data on infected workers. There have been four cases worldwide of health workers infecting patients since 1992, with no cases in the UK. None of the workers was on drug treatment at the time. HIV was no longer a killer disease, Prof . Davies said. 'We’ve got outdated rules. At the moment we bar totally safe healthcare workers who are on treatment with HIV from performing many surgical treatments, and that includes dentists' Professor Dame Sally Davies, England's chief medical officer . She added: ‘What we need is a simpler system that . continues to protect the public through encouraging people to get tested . for HIV as early as possible and that does not hold back some of our . best healthcare workers because of a risk that is more remote than being . struck by lightning.’ Deborah Jack, chief executive of the National Aids Trust, said: ‘Allowing healthcare workers living with HIV to undertake exposure-prone procedures corrects the current guidance which offers no more protection for the general public but keeps qualified and skilled people from working in the career they had spent many years training for.’ British Dental Association scientific adviser Professor Damien Walmsley added: ‘Dentists in the UK comply with rigorous infection control procedures to protect both patients and the dental team against the risk of transmission of blood-borne infections.’ Sir Nick Partridge, chief executive at HIV charity Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ‘Advances in medication have transformed what it means to live with HIV, and it’s great to see regulations starting to catch up. ‘People diagnosed in good time can have full, healthy lives, and effective treatment dramatically reduces the risk of the virus being passed on. ‘So long as the right safeguards are in place, there is now no reason why a dentist or a midwife with HIV should be barred from treating patients, or why people who would prefer to test at home should be denied that chance.’","Ban in place for more than 20 years to be lifted by the Government .

Antiques Roadshow veteran David Battie has revealed he nearly lost his . leg after breaking it in a fall and contracting a severe infection in . the injury. The 70-year-old spent nearly seven months in hospital being treated with antibiotics and undergoing nine operations - none of which managed to shift the bacteria. After treatment failed, doctors threatened to amputate his leg but he begged them to find an alternative. David Battie (far left) revealed that he nearly lost his leg when it became infected following a fall. He has been a regular host on the Antiques Road Show for 36 years. They decided to carry out plastic surgery to cut infected flesh and bone from his right ankle and fill the space with a ‘steak’ taken from his left thigh. Now finally back on his feet, Mr Battie will make his first appearance on the Roadshow in over a year this Sunday – and has revealed he made history as the first person to appear on the programme barefoot. ‘I’m much happier without shoes and socks on,’ he said. ‘The infection is gone now but I’m still getting quite a bit of pain, sometimes a lot of pain. I try to keep (my leg) up as much as possible.’ Mr Battie, who has been a regular feature on the show for 36 years, shattered the bones in his lower leg when he slipped on wet grass in April last year. Surgeons drilled into his leg to fit a metal ‘scaffold’ to hold the broken bones in place. But within days bacteria had got in through one of the drill holes and caused an infection. Mr Battie said he had considered leaving the popular BBC programme but that he is excited to return for another series. Mr Battie was told by a nurse to go to A&E at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, where a registrar he described as ‘completely idiotic’ told him the weeping from his wound meant it was ‘getting better’ and sent him home. He returned twice in the following week only to be sent home each time - and was only admitted on his fourth visit. He said: ‘I’m not a medical expert, but if they had seen it earlier perhaps I would have been OK.’ Describing the months of treatment he had in hospital, he said: ‘They were pumping me full of antibiotics. ‘In the end they tried to inject it every two hours day and night for a month. That was awful. I was dog tired all the time.’ At the end of November he was taken to the Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead where surgeons performed the operation which saved his leg, although he still has to take ‘handfuls of pills’ to keep the infection at bay. Amazing, Mr Battie can now drive and walk again, although he feels tired most of the time because he sleeps badly due to the pain in both legs. He said he was ‘amazed’ he had ended up which so many complications from a slip ‘where most people would just fall down and go “Ow”.’ ‘It was so silly,’ he added, ‘I had just got out of the car to stretch my legs and slipped on a patch of wet grass.’ He said he had considered quitting the Antiques Roadshow but is thrilled to be back – although he is limiting his involvement to filming locations near his Sussex home. ‘I was worried all the morphine had aged me and affected my memory, but it doesn’t seem to be a problem,’ he said. Mr Battie has written to the Royal Sussex County Hospital with ‘suggestions’ for how it could improve, but said he had not heard anything save for one phone call from ‘a woman in the complaints department who clearly didn’t want to talk to me.’The first episode of the new series of the Antiques Roadshow is on BBC1 at 8pm on Sunday.","70 year-old told of how doctors wanted to amputate leg after it became severely infected .

A mother who admitted strangling her toddler son and stabbing him to death has been detained indefinitely in a psychiatric unit. Angela Vane, 40, who suffers with paranoid schizophrenia, strangled her two-year-old son Shaun O'Neill with a neck tie before fatally stabbing him in the abdomen at the family home in Devon. A court heard mother-of-three Vane told a passerby who found her standing on a bypass on the morning of Shaun's death: 'I've just killed my baby.' 'An unimaginably sad case': Shaun O'Neill, two, left, was strangled and stabbed to death by his mother, Angela Vane, 40, who admitted manslaughter at Plymouth Crown Court yesterday . Vane denied murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility at Plymouth Crown Court yesterday. She was discovered at around 8am on January 19 on the wrong side of a safety barrier on a bypass near her home in Modbury, Devon. Vane told the man she was going to jump as she had just killed her son. She told him: 'I'm in a lot of trouble, I've just killed my baby.' The passerby took Vane to the local police station, where she admitted the offence. Police officers searching the family home discovered Shaun dead on his mother's bed. He was discovered with a neck tie bound tightly around his neck and a stab wound to his abdomen, the court heard. Medical reports later confirmed he had been killed by ligature strangulation and a stab wound to the abdomen. Manslaughter: Vane is being detained indefinitely at a psychiatric unit after she pleaded guilty to manslaughter at Plymouth Crown Court . Vane, who has two children in their 20s from a previous relationship, told police officers she had tried to strangle her little boy. She said: 'It went on for ages. I thought if I put a knife into him I could feel his heart.'Vane appeared in court via a video link from Fromeside Clinic in Bristol yesterday.Sentencing, Judge Graham Cottle described the case as 'unimaginably sad' and said Vane was 'very unwell' at the time of Shaun's death. He said it was his responsibility to detain Vane under the Mental Health Act due to the risk she posed to both herself and the public.'This is an unimaginably sad case,' he said. 'It's quite clear that you were clearly very unwell at the time when you took your child's life.'Nobody has any criticism of you as a mother, in fact the contrary is true. You have two older children whose response to this has been both compassionate and understanding. 'You were clearly unwell. You were suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and the nature of your illness and the degree of it as such requires you to be detailed in hospital. That is the most appropriate disposal of the case.' Defending Vane, Fiona Elder said prior to the incident there had been no criticism of the mother and that Shaun had been a 'well-cared for child'. The court heard how Vane, who separated from Shaun's father in 2010, has a history of mental illness. She was admitted to the Glenbourne mental health unit in Plymouth in 2011 where she spent three weeks being treated for acute psychosis, during which Sean was taken into care. The police were called to the family home on numerous occasions prior to her being sectioned as Vane suffered with delusions and thought Mr O'Neill was spying on her and shining laser beams on her home, the court was told. Speaking after the sentencing, Detective Inspector John Ardron, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said: 'This is a case where there are no winners. It is one of the saddest and most tragic cases I've dealt with in 24 years.'","Angela Vane, 40, admitted killing son Shaun, two, at family home in Devon .

The U.S. government is involved in a legal battle to stop Michael Jackson's gem-encrusted glove falling into the hands of an African dictator's son. The late singer's glove was allegedly bought with dirty money by Equatorial Guinea President's son Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, the U.S. claims. Assets worth about $71 million were seized in April 2011 from Obiang, who owns a fleet of Rolls-Royces, Ferraris and Lamborghinis, as well as $38 million private jet and $30 million Malibu mansion. Legal fight: A jewel-encrusted glove once owned by Michael Jackson is listed in the lawsuit . Big spender: Obiang's lawyers say the government only has evidence that their client spent money, not where it came from . The 42-year-old, who moved to the U.S. in 1991, allegedly laundered stolen public funds in banks across the world, according to Sky News. The aspiring rap musician bought Jackson's glove three years ago along with other items from the late singer's estate. France has also moved to seize assets from the dictator's son, including a $68 million Paris mansion he bought, along with his $2 million wine collection, according to the New York Times. The Paris mansion had 101 rooms, including a Turkish bath, hair salon, nightclub and movie theater. Bathrooms were described as dripping in gold and jewel-encrusted fixtures and French police also found and seized 11 supercars, including two Bugatti Veyrons which are among the most powerful and expensive cars in the world. More than 70 per cent of Equatorial Guinea’s population lives in poverty, but President Obiang and those closely associated with him have amassed huge fortunes through corruption, the U.S. claims. Lavish: The dictator's son owns a $30 million Malibu mansion . According to the lawsuit, Obiang, who was appointed forestry minister by his father, 'amassed over $300 million in net worth, all while earning an income of less than $100,000 per year as an unelected public official appointed by his father,' Sky News reported. The lawsuit lists assets he is said to own in the U.S. which, as well as Jackson's glove, include seven life-size statues of the singer in a collection worth $494,000. His Malibu mansion, off the Pacific Coast Highway, has a golf course, tennis courts and two swimming pools, and Obiang is also said to have a fleet of cars including a Ferrari worth more than $500,000, according to Time. A California judge threw out the case last year, saying it failed to prove the fortune had been amassed through illegal means in Equatorial Guinea. The hearing on Monday is an amended version of the complaint. Obiang has been made Equatorial Guinea's Vice-President and part of the country's mission to Unesco, in a move said to be an attempt to offer him diplomatic immunity, the New York Times said. Collection: The glove is part of a $494,000 Jackson collection owned by Obiang . Lawyers for Obiang argued in a brief that the U.S. has no grounds to retain the Jackson memoribilia. Obiang Jr’s lawyers argued in a brief filed last month that the US still has no grounds to retain his pop souvenirs. 'The government still has not identified a single victim of extortion or bribery,' it said. 'All that the government has is evidence that [the] Claimant spent money. Where the money came from is a matter of pure speculation.'","Former Equatorial Guinea minister's $494,000 King of Pop collection listed in lawsuit .

Once back in the woodland it took Bear mere moments to track down his canine pal who had been underground for 36 hours.

He was labelled the terrorist advocate for taking on clients accused of mass murder and torture . French lawyer Jacques Verges, nicknamed ""Terror's Advocate"" for a high-profile client list that included a former Gestapo chief and Marxist militant Carlos the Jackal, has died of a heart attack aged 88, his publisher said. Widely regarded as one of France's most brilliant, if provocative, lawyers, Verges made a name for himself by accepting clients spurned by others as impossible to defend. The lawyer died on Thursday in the Parisian house where 18th century philosopher Voltaire once lived, according to his publisher Pierre-Guillaume de Roux. 'Like Voltaire, he cultivated the art of permanent revolt and volte-face,' his publisher said in a statement. Verges was born in Thailand in 1925 to a French father and Vietnamese mother and grew up on the French-ruled Indian Ocean island of La Reunion. The family moved there after his father lost his job as consul because he married a foreigner, something forbidden at the time. In the 1960s, Verges defended Algerians fighting for independence at a time when an end to French rule in the North African possession was violently opposed by some sections of French society. As a Communist student leader, Verges befriended Pol Pot, head of the Khmer Rouge which was responsible for the genocide in Cambodia in which 2.2 million people died. Verges baffled his countrymen by agreeing to defend Klaus Barbie, head of the Gestapo in the city of Lyon who was twice sentenced to death in absentia for war crimes. Verges, bottom, defended former Gestapo officer Klaus Barbie sitting behind a glass screen (right) at the Lyon Assize court. Barbie was accused of crimes against humanity, in 1987 . The Thailand-born lawyer befriended Pol Pot, pictured, the Communist ruler of the Khmer Rouge and the Prime Minister of Cambodia (offically Democratic Kampuchea during his rule) from 1975-1979 . When Barbie fled France in 1944, Verges was marching to liberate Paris with de Gaulle's Free French forces. 'If he (Barbie) had been at the end of the barrel of my gun, I would have shot him,' Verges told Reuters in an interview in 2002. 'Now I am simply doing my job as a lawyer.' Jacques Vergs (left) maintained his friendship with the Pol Pot family, and was filmed dining with Noun Chea (right), the brother number two of the Khmer Rouge, for a 2007 French documentary . Other high profile clients included Lebanese militant Georges Ibrahim Abdallah and former Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, and he also gave legal advice to ex-Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic. For some of his critics, Verges' client list meant his hands were as soiled as those of the people he defended. In 2007, a French documentary about his life dubbed him the 'Terror's Advocate', a nickname that stuck.","Verges befriended Pol Pot, head of the Khmer Rouge and defended Tariq Aziz, the former Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister .

It was the first such execution in a country where the killers of media workers often evade justice. GRAPHIC CONTENT: A firing squad executes Aden Sheikh Abdi in the Somali capital Mogadishu for the killing of local journalist Hassan Yusuf Absuge, pictured, last year . The death sentence, confirmed by Colonel Muse Keyse, a spokesman for Somalia’s military court, was carried out by three policemen and three security personnel. Abdi, who had been accused of belonging to the Islamic extremist rebels al-Shabab, was found guilty of murder last month by a Mogadishu court. Authorities said he killed Hassan in reprisal for his reporting of a suicide attack, according to local news reports. Tom Rhodes, the East Africa consultant for the Committee to Protect Journalists, said the execution would help end impunity in Somalia, one of the most dangerous places for media workers. At least 18 Somali journalists were killed last year. Unidentified armed men shot Hassan, a reporter and producer for the private Radio Maanta, three times in the head near a high school in Yaqshid District in Mogadishu. The killers fled before the police arrived at the scene. Hassan had worked as a journalist since 1989 and contributed to Radio Mogadishu and the broadcaster GBC, according to local news reports. He had covered a suicide bomb attack the day before at a popular café frequented by journalists and civil servants. At least 14 people died in the blast, including three journalists, news reports said. Local journalists said they were skeptical of the court's finding because of perceived violations in the way the trial was handled and the presence of some prejudicial evidence.

A fifth Vanderbilt football player and two other men have been arrested following the rape of a 21-year-old female student in a dorm last June. The three suspects are being indicted for their actions after the rape, and will not face sex crimes charges.  Four other football players were indicted earlier this month for raping a student and taping the assault. Wide receiver Chris Boyd, 21, is being charged with accessory after the fact. Another arrest: Wide-receiver Chris Boyd is being charged with accessory after the fact for allegedly trying to help the four accused rapists cover up the sexual assault . Sex crime: Four Vanderbilt University football players were indicted earlier this month in connection with the June 23 rape of an unconscious 21-year-old girl in a dorm room . The Roswell, Georgia native is being accused of giving the suspects advice on how to cover up the sexual assault. Boyd was expected to surrender himself to police. Since the indictment, he has been suspended from the team. Beth Fortune, the university's Vice Chancellor for Public Affairs issued a statement following the fifth indictment. She said that all of the allegations are 'deeply troubling' and that the university is taking them very seriously. 'Pursuant to the athletic department conduct policy, Mr Boyd has been suspended from the football team, pending further review,' Ms Fortune said. Two other men, acquaintances of Brandon Vandenburg, one of the players charged with rape, were arrested yesterday in Riverside County, California. Miles Joseph Finley, 19, and Joseph Dominick Quinzio, 20, are being charged with tampering with evidence. Accomplices: 19-year-old Miles Joseph Finley, left and 20-year-old Joseph Dominick Quinzio, right, are acquaintances of Vandenburg's accused of tampering with evidence . Initially Finley tried to flea when he saw authorities arrive at his house, but he was quickly apprehended. The two are being held as fugitives wanted by the State of Tennessee and will be extradited to the to face trial. Nashville Chief of Police Steve Anderson stated that the new indictments were reflective of hundreds of law enforcement hours spent on the case. He reiterated that the investigation remains open and active. 'We are looking at all persons who may have been involved in this event, before, during and after the fact. Additional charges cannot be ruled out,' he said. The arrests yesterday come after the four players suspected of carrying out the rape were arrested indicted earlier this month. Safety Cory Batey, 19 of Nashville, Tennessee; defensive back Brandon Banks, 19, of Brandywine, Maryland; receiver Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie, 19, of Woodville, Mississippi; and tight end Brandon Vandenburg, 20, of Indio, California were charged with two counts of aggravated sexual battery for an incident tipped to campus officials by surveillance video. Vandenburg also is charged with one count of tampering with evidence and one count of unlawful photography.

Brandon Banks, 19, of Brandywine, Maryland (left) and Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie, 19, (right) of Woodville, Mississippi are also charged in the crime . Vanderbilt dismissed the players June 29 and barred them from the campus pending the investigation. At the time, Ms Fortune said that their first thoughts are for the victim, a Vanderbilt student, and that the university will continue to offer her all of its services and support. 'We are shocked and saddened by the allegations that such an assault has taken place on our campus and that they include members of our football team,' she said in a statement. 'The charges brought today against the four former Vanderbilt football players allege conduct which is abhorrent and will never be tolerated. We will review our athletics program to be sure that it, like all other programs at the university, reflects our culture of community and respect for others and that our student athletes are held to the same high standards of conduct as all our students.' According to Nashville police, the four men are charged with raping the unconscious woman inside Vandenburg's room at Gillette House dormitory early on June 23. University officials checking the dorm's surveillance in the hallways on an unrelated matter noticed the four's behavior and notified the Vanderbilt University Police Department the night of June 25. Campus police contacted Nashville's sex crimes unit June 26. Vanderbilt did not identify the four players until July 15 before the Commodores headed to Alabama for Southeastern Conference media days. The players already were listed in the team's media guide for the upcoming season but no longer are on the roster. Vanderbilt head coach James Franklin watches his players during an NCAA college football practice on Thursday, Aug. 1, 2013, in Nashville, Tennessee . None of the four played a snap for Vanderbilt last season. Batey came in last season as a receiver and redshirted behind Jordan Matthews and Chris Boyd before switching to safety this spring. Banks also redshirted as a freshman last season. His attorney Grover Collins declined to comment on the indictment but said last month that Banks is innocent and fully cooperating with police. McKenzie redshirted in 2012, but the 5-foot-8 receiver had four catches for 83 yards in the Commodores' spring game -- the most yards receiving in the game. His attorney, Jodie Bell, did not immediately return a message by the AP. The 6-foot-5 Vandenburg was considered one of the top junior college tight ends nationally coming out of Xavier College Prep, and he became the first junior college transfer at Vanderbilt since Jordan Rodgers in 2010.

An anonymous donation made to a fund 85 . years ago is now worth £350m, but cannot be touched due to a condition made by the donor at the time . The £500,000 bequest - the same amount left by former nurse Joan Edwards which embarrassed the government this week - was to inspire the government to pay off the UK's debt. But the donor specified in 1928 that the fund . should be held in trust until the country raises enough money to pay off . the whole debt, which currently stands at £1.2 trillion. Donation: A £500,000 legacy left to the nation in 1928 to pay off the national debt is worth £350 million today . The last Victorian: Miss Edwards pictured shortly before her death and, right, as a child in 1931, was well known amongst her neighbours leading a strict and pious lifestyle . The National Fund, set up in the same year of the donation and now managed by Barclays, has grown to become one of the largest charities in the UK by net assets. Barclays has been trying for four years to get permission to use the money to make charitable grants or to turn it over to the Treasury, but any change would have to be approved by a court. A spokesman said: 'We've been working ever since we became the trustee to change the original objects, which say the funds can be used only to pay off the entire national debt. 'We are working with the Charity Commission and the attorney general's office to look at how best to take the fund forward.' Home sweet home: Joan Edwards pictured outside her Bristol council home in 1931 the former nurse left her fortune to the Government to spend 'as they may think fit.' A spokesman for the attorney general's office said: 'There has been correspondence between the Charity Commission, the trustees and ourselves over the National Fund. 'We are looking at a number of options for the future of the Fund, consistent with its object of extinguishing or reducing the national debt. 'It would not be right to comment further whilst this process continues.' A spokeswoman for the Charity Commission said is it continuing dialogue with the trustee and the attorney general's office regarding the charity. This week, the Tories and Liberal Democrats handed the £520,000 left by Miss Edwards to the Treasury after a furious row emerged over their acceptance of the money.

The legacy, disclosed along with other donations, sparked a bizarre row after a copy of the document emerged. Conservative and Lib Dem officials previously briefed that they had split the money because it was earmarked for ""whichever party was in government"". But the text obtained by the Daily Mail showed Miss Edwards - who died in September aged 90 - identified the beneficiary as ""whichever government is in office at the date of my death"". As the backlash gathered pace, both coalition partners declared they would hand the funds to the Treasury as a gesture of good faith.","Donor specified that money would only be handed over when country raised enough to pay off national debt - but that stands today at £1.2 trillion .

Facing the end of school and having no job offers, Penn, 23, decided he had to do something to stand out. So he set up a table on the sidewalk outside Goldman Sachs advertising a website with his resume and contact information - all because he wants to work for the famous investment bank. ‘It is the pinnacle, it’s everything we . learn about in school, it is the top,’ Penn told Fox Business when . asked why he wanted to work for Goldman Sachs. Resourceful: Having not heard from Goldman Sachs after applying online, Michael Penn took his message directly to them - handing out coffee and doughnuts on the sidewalk outside the bank's lower Manhattan headquarters . Though Penn told Fox Business that . he never did get an interview with the famous investment bank, he has . had several interviews, and for that he’s grateful. Penn is graduating with a Masters in Global Management from Fordham University in two weeks and is looking for work in business development. The idea was to stand out by doing something unique, as well as getting in front of potential decision makers, Penn told multiple media outlets. ‘It’s just simple economics — supply and demand. The jobs are there. There are just more master’s and MBAs out there now. You really need to get out there and differentiate yourself,’ he told ABC News. Custom coffee cups: Custom sleeves made for the coffee he was handing out had a miniature resume on them, Penn told Fox Business he will answer every message sent to him - even hate mail . His table had a banner with his website, www.HireMichaelPenn.com, and his coffee cups came with custom-made sleeves that had contact information and a short job seeking pitch to anyone interested. It didn’t take long for Penn to hear back from someone interested in his brand of ingenuity. ‘My girlfriend saw you doing this, she took a picture,’ Penn told WPTV a potential employer said to him. ‘I'm intrigued. I want to speak with you, how fast can you get down to my office?’ Penn was there later that morning for an interview, and has had several since, according to reports. Though he still has no job offers, Penn told Fox Business the drastic action was necessary because he couldn’t see himself having to live in his parents’ basement like so many of his fellow graduates. The whole setup set Penn back only $150, he told Fox Business, and even that had to be earned. Penn’s mother funded the operation by paying him to design a website, he added. His website lists his experience, multiple degrees and even that he was a US Chess Federation National Co-Champion at age nine, in 1998, his studies on three continents and his co-founding of Finding Refuge, a non-governmental organization whose goal is to eradicate child slavery in Ghana – Archbishop Desmond Tutu is a spokesperson. Blessed: Penn told Fox Business that he feels lucky and blessed to have the opportunities he now has . Despite the down economy and considerable student loan debt from graduate school Penn remains hopeful. ‘My life has changed for the better,’ Penn said, ‘I’m so fortunate, so blessed and so grateful.’ Penn is just the latest in a series of people who have been forced to use innovative means to find jobs during the so-called Great Recession.

"PUBLISHED: . 13:08 EST, 12 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:04 EST, 13 March 2013 . Demand for Red Cross food parcels is at its highest since the Second World War. And while the increase might be expected in war zones or areas affected by natural disasters, the surge in need has come from countries in the EU. One day after a leading European politician warned of parallels between the continent now and in the days before the First World War, it was revealed people across the whole of the EU are increasingly reliant on charities for food and shelter. Poverty in Paris: French Red Cross volunteers attend to a homeless person living in a train station tunnel during a night round of French Samu . Two thirds of Red Cross societies in . Europe have begun distributing food aid – the most serious indicator yet . of the scale and depth of the economic crisis. Yves Daccord, of the charity’s . International Committee, said its food distribution had not been as high . since the end of the Second World War. He added: ‘We . are now seeing for the first time that the Red Cross in several . European countries need to focus on the poor in their own country, much . more than on external missions outside Europe. 'We are giving out more . food in Europe than at any time since the end of WW2.' 'It is not just Eastern or Southern . Europe; it is across the European Union, people in Luxembourg and . Finland... Public support services begin to fail and people run out of . all support mechanisms, so they come to the church or the Red Cross,' said Eberhard Lueder, who heads the Red Cross's European Union unit.' Handouts in Spain: Red Cross worker arranges boxes with biscuits while unemployed Spaniards, right, wait in line for a food hand out inside a Red Cross post in Villacanas . 'Nowadays, . nobody knows who is going to be hit next. Many people who would have . considered themselves safe — middle class — find themselves in a . situation where they cannot finance their own needs.' The charity said it is also being asked for record levels of help water, electricity bills and . rent payments for poor people. The social consequences of the . economic crisis worries the EU Commission. José Manuel Barroso wants to . raise the impact of their suffering on Thursday ahead of the EU's spring . summit. Waiting for handouts: Unemployed Spaniards wait at a Red Cross post for a food handout in Villacanas, Spain . Countries like France, Germany, .

In Belgium and France, . there are shops where people can buy food and clothing for heavily . reduced prices. Jorge Nuno . Mayer, the secretary general of Caritas Europa, a Catholic welfare . charity, said people turn to food aid when difficulties in paying for . utilities such as housing, water and electricity, mean they have no . money left for food purchases. 'The information we are getting from Caritas organizations all over Europe shows that more and more people are asking for food aid. The main reasons are increasing unemployment and long-term unemployment, increasing in-work poverty, and austerity measures that affect social protection schemes,' Mayer said.","Charity reveals devastating toll of downturn .

You could say disgraced parking meter mechanic James Bagarozzo was given no quarter when he was sentenced to prison Friday for stealing $210,000 in coins from the very machines he was hired to fix. Over more than eight years, Bagarozzo, 58, brought home 10,500lbs of quarters - which he stashed in his pockets, in a sack in his truck, in closets at his house - before dutifully rolling and packing them in $500 boxes to be exchanged for cash at banks on his lunch hour. On Friday, a judge imposed a 2 1/2-year sentence on Bagarozzo, who blamed a gambling addiction and an illness he believed would kill him before he built a nest egg for his family. Scroll down for video . Money man: Former City of Buffalo parking meter mechanic James Bagarozzo was handed a 2 1/2 year prison term for stealing $210,000 in quarters from the meters he was supposed to be repairing . Heavy load: Over more than eight years, Bagarozzo, 57, brought home 10,500lbs of quarters . ‘With all its problems, the last thing the city of Buffalo needs is employees who don't do what they're paid to do,’ U.S. District Judge Richard Arcara said as he rejected a defense plea for home confinement or community service. From 2003 through 2011, the meter mechanic spent the first half of every workday stealing from 70 to 75 meters, prosecutors said. Rather than fix machines, he broke them so that quarters would collect on top where he could grab them with his hands instead of dropping into the collection canister. Bagarozzo, speaking purposely but with little emotion, apologized during a brief statement to the court and said he accepted responsibility. ‘I have hit rock bottom and I have had to come up with my family and friends,’ the 58-year-old said.A former co-worker, Lawrence Charles, followed Bagarozzo's lead, stealing $15,000 in quarters over about five years, prosecutors said. He was expected to get 6 months to a year in prison. His sentencing also was supposed to be Friday, but it was postponed until August 29. The employees came under scrutiny in 2011 after Parking Commissioner Kevin Helfer noticed the city's new computerized pay stations were bringing in far more money than the old quarter-fed parking meters. ‘What may have begun as a theft of nickels and dimes, in the end was the equivalent of a major bank heist,’ U.S. Attorney William Hochul said. Since the arrests, the city's annual parking meter revenue has increased by more than $500,000, Helfer said. During the hearing, it was revealed that in 2008, three years before Bagarozzo's arrest, city Hall received a complaint accusing the repairman of being involved in suspicious activities. Candid camera: This Oct. 3, 2011, image taken from surveillance video shows Bagarozzo remove a half-full red bag of quarters from his pocket . Caught red-handed: Bagarozzo throws a handful or quarters into a red bag on the seat of a truck while working his job in Buffalo . Keeping busy: The meter mechanic spent the first half of every workday stealing from 70 to 75 meters . At the time, however, Bagarozzo was let off the hook with only a reprimand and allowed to keep his job. Police Commissioner Daniel Derenda said the investigation is not over. Disciple: A former co-worker, Lawrence Charles, followed Bagarozzo's lead, stealing $15,000 in quarters over about five years . ‘We are looking at other people,’ he said. At the time of his arrest, investigators found $40,000 in cash in the ceiling of Bagarozzo's bedroom, $4,100 in a dresser and $3,000 worth of quarters in closets in bags and boxes around the house. Prosecutors said the money allowed Bagarozzo to send his daughters to college and pay off his mortgage, but defense attorney James Harrington said virtually everything was lost at casinos. ‘It was rooted really in this . spiraling addiction that he had,’ said Harrington, who gave Arcara 138 . letters of support from Bagarozzo's friends and family. In . court papers, Harrington wrote that Bagarozzo's stealing began in 2003 . following a serious episode of Crohn's disease that left him believing . he did not have long to live. ‘He said he was worried about his wife and two teenage daughters and that they would have little if he died,’ the lawyer wrote. Even . though Bagarozzo lost his job and was sentenced for stealing from the . City of Albany, the prosecutors said he will be allowed to continue . collecting his pension, according to the local station WGRZ. Evidence of tampering: Rather than fix meters, the mechanic broke them so that quarters would collect on top where he could grab them with his hands . Stash house: Police found $40,000 in cash in the ceiling of Bagarozzo's bedroom, $4,100 in a dresser and $3,000 worth of quarters hidden elsewhere on the premises . Bagarozzo, who will be allowed to surrender voluntarily, declined to speak with reporters as he left the court surrounded by family. Buffalo News reported that the FBI has expanded its investigation into the parking meter thefts, which now allegedly targets two other former city employees accused of stealing thousands of dollars in quarters. The two men, who worked together on one tuck as parking meter collectors, were fired after their supervisor had discovered an authorized second vault inside their city-owned vehicle.","James Bagarozzo, 58, brought home 10,500lbs of quarters between 2003 and 2011 Blamed crime on a gambling addiction and Crohn's disease he believed would kill him .

Leanne Atherton said she was not fully aware of the risks of using tanning beds and was spending up to 20 minutes a week on them. She was diagnosed with malignant melanoma in June and has had a lymph node biopsy to find out if the cancer has spread.

Some of the nation’s best-loved programmes including Coronation Street and EastEnders are littered with so many references to alcohol that they are a ‘major source of exposure’ for children and young people. The study  found 92 per cent of episodes contain some form of alcohol imagery including drinking, bottle branding and scenes in the Rovers Return and Queen Vic. Bingeing: EastEnders' character Lauren Branning during a scene from the soap. The shows have been blamed for encouraging teenage drinking after a study found 92% of episodes contain alcohol imagery . Research also revealed drink was a recurring theme every nine minutes on terrestrial channels during the evening. Alcohol use was highest in soap operas, closely followed by feature films, says the report published in the Journal of Public Health. The greatest amount of alcohol content was in the hour immediately before the 9pm watershed. The study, by researchers at Nottingham University and King’s College London, is the first for nearly two decades to document alcohol content during prime time on the five most popular terrestrial TV channels. Cheers: Maria Connor and Marcus Dent pictured in a scene from Coronation Street . The researchers said: ‘Our findings demonstrate that prime-time television is a major source of exposure to alcohol imagery among children, and as such is likely to be contributing to uptake and consumption of alcohol among young people in the UK. ‘Tighter regulation of advertising and promotion of alcoholic drinks, including promotion through sporting events, has been proposed to reduce [such] consumption. ‘We suggest that such measures should include television programme content as well as advertising, particularly before the 9pm watershed.’ They added: ‘Episodes of alcohol branding comprised advertising, such as billboards, branded products such as bottles visible behind a bar or held or used in a scene and branded items such as umbrellas or clothing.’ The study examined more than 400 broadcasting hours between 6pm and 10pm, including adverts. The researchers said it was ‘surprising’ to see real brands of alcohol alongside fictitious branding in TV pubs. The study found that 92 per cent of soap episodes carried alcohol imagery compared to 86 per cent of feature films, and sport and comedy,  both 63 per cent. The study led Alcohol Concern to call for the appointment of an alcohol advertising regulator. But ITV spokesman Alison Sinclair insisted alcohol imagery in programmes is taken seriously. Influence: The study suggested prime-time TV is a major source of exposure to alcohol imagery among teenagers and is likely to contribute to them consuming alcohol (picture posed by models) ‘Real advertising brand names never feature and the focus is on the drama in a small community and on the dialogue amongst the characters in the pub as opposed to alcohol intake,’ she said. BBC spokesman Joanna Allen added: ‘Any alcoholic drink bought or consumed by a character in EastEnders will always be a fictitious brand. Any use of branded alcohol is purely for background dressing.’ Last year, the World Health Organisation found that binge drinking among British teenage girls was the worst in Europe. More than half of all 15 and 16-year-olds admit to getting drunk at least once a month.","Research finds drink is a recurring theme every nine minutes on terrestrial channels during the evenings .

One voice: All UK Girl Guiding troops have to use the new secular pledge (file photo) A Christian Girl Guide troop who had refused to drop their traditional oath to God have backed down and agreed to accept a new secular wording, it emerged yesterday. Plans for a new religion-free oath due to be introduced next month have proved controversial, with 839 complaints to the movement’s leadership and warnings of a damaging split. Instead of a promise to God, youngsters will instead pledge to ‘be true to myself and develop my beliefs’ after it was decreed the old wording could discourage new members from joining. Backed by a former bishop, the group from Harrogate, North Yorkshire had pledged to retain the old oath, saying the organisation had ‘God at its core’. However yesterday its stand was at an end after leaders of the troop met senior figures from Girlguiding UK, which has insisted no exceptions can be made. The change of heart came after pressure from local volunteer and self-professed atheist Jem Henderson as well as from the National Secular Society. Hazel Mitford, leader of the Harrogate-based St Paul’s United Reform Church troop, had written to a local newspaper along with Brownie representatives pledging to stick to the old Christian oath. ‘Girlguiding has God at its core and anyone who has issue with this is free to start their own organisation,’ they wrote. Their stand was last week backed by former Bishop of Rochester Michael Nazir-Ali who insisted Girl Guiding was ‘rooted in the Christian faith’ and warned the new oath could split the movement. It emerged yesterday that 839 complaints had been made by members to Girlguiding UK about its insistence that all troops should introduce the new oath. Yesterday, however, it emerged that the St Paul’s group had agreed to fall into line and accept the new wording after meeting national leaders. Girlguiding’s Chief Guide Gill Slocombe said: ‘We always want to support our leaders and we spent some time talking with the Harrogate volunteers about the new promise and supporting them to understand it is intended to embrace all girls, those with a faith belief and those without. ‘As a result they decided they would be able to start using it as planned from September 1.’ Inclusive: Chief Guide, Gill Slocombe says the pledge is about including girls of all faiths and beliefs, not just Christians . But Mrs Mitford added that she wouldn’t instruct members of the troop whether to follow the old or new oath, saying: ‘It’s for the girls to decide what they choose to do. ‘Girlguiding is saying, “Yes they will make the new promise”, but the way that the girls explore their own spiritual journey is up to them, it’s not dictated by anybody else really.’ She declined to comment yesterday. Girlguiding UK insisted response nationally to the new oath had been ‘overwhelmingly positive’ and that the 839 complaints from members represented just 0.15 per cent of its overall strength. The climbdown was welcomed by Jem Henderson, 28, an atheist volunteer leader who had accused the Harrogate group of excluding non-believers, saying ‘all I wanted out of it was for the troops to take the secular promise’. ‘I think it’s more important that all girls get included in Guides than just the ones that have religious affiliation,’ she said. ‘It’s a new oath, and more leaders that are younger and perhaps less stuck in their ways should make Guiding more exciting for people that want to join that don’t just want to go and sit in a church hall with women who are older than their mothers talking about whatever it is they’re talking about.’ She said she now hoped to volunteer with the St Paul’s troop and didn’t expect her public criticism of its leaders to cause problems. ‘I think it will be fine,’ she said. ‘I mean, they’re Christians, therefore they’re capable of turning the other cheek.'","Yorkshire Girl Guides group refused to use secular oath .

But Nicola Whitehill’s daily routine is a little more complicated. She needs three hours of bathing in oil and slathering moisturiser on her skin to unlock her stiffened limbs. Miss Whitehill, 40, has systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), meaning her skin and blood vessels harden and restrict her movement. Nicola Whitehill, 40, suffers from both Raynaud's phenomenon and systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), meaning her skin and blood vessels harden and restrict her movement . Ms Whitehill says that when she wakes up she is 'like the Tin Man' and that her skin feels very stiff and as thought it is made of leather . Ms Whitehill must also wear gloves constantly as . simply putting her hand into the fridge can mean her fingers turn blue . and cause her immense pain. She also wears Ugg boots to keep her toes warm . Raynaud's phenomenon affects the blood supply to certain parts of the body - usually the fingers and toes. It occurs when the blood vessels go into a temporary spasm which blocks the blood flow (pictured) ‘When I wake up I’m like the Tin Man. My whole body is stiff and feels like leather,’ she said.   ‘I have to . bathe in liquid paraffin and then cover myself in cream, otherwise I . can’t even straighten my arms out in front of me.’ She also has Raynaud’s syndrome, a . condition in which blood is prevented from reaching the extremities of . the body, mainly the fingers and toes, when exposed to the cold. The diseases are linked, with a small proportion of patients suffering from both. Miss Whitehill, a barrister, was diagnosed in 1997 after several years of feeling unwell and exhausted. It takes Ms Whitehill three hours to prepare to leave the house as she has to apply so many creams to her skin . She has to bathe in liquid paraffin to soften her skin or she is unable to straighten her arms out in front of her . Ms Whitehill has to go to her local hospital every month and sees her consultant in London twice a year. She works hard to raise awareness of her conditions . Ms Whitehill says that for the first seven years that she had the conditions she did not look after herself properly and that she failed to recognise how serious they are . Scleroderma, an auti-immune condition, results in an overproduction of collagen, which is found in connective tissue. Scleroderma is a disease that results in the hardening and thickening of areas of skin. It is an autoimmune condition which means that the body attacks its own tissues causing them to harden. Systemic scleroderma, as suffered by Ms Whitehill, can also affect the internal organs. This can cause symptoms such as heartburn and difficulty swallowing. The condition causes the skin to become thick and puffy which can restrict the movement. It can also cause the fingers and toes to swell. In some cases it causes hair loss, weight loss, fatigue and joint pain. Treatments include taking steroids and immunosuppressants, physiotherapy and applying creams and moisturisers. It affects skin, blood vessels, and joints but can sometimes sink into internal organs such as the heart, kidneys and bowel. Luckily, Miss Whitehill is not  yet . affected to this extent but she does suffer from ulcers, which build up . on her fingers and toes. Changes in temperature set off her symptoms and . something as simple as a cool breeze or air conditioning can  affect . her. ‘I live in gloves and Ugg boots, and . when I leave the house I look like an Eskimo, all year round,’ she said . at her home in Southport, Merseyside. ‘I can’t walk in proper shoes any more, but I have to be thankful for the things I do have.’ The severity of the illness meant  she . had to give up work in 2004  and she now spends as much time as she can . working as a volunteer with the Raynaud’s and Scleroderma Association. She relishes the chance to help other patients understand the condition, manage it properly and live life to the full. ‘There isn’t enough awareness  out . there, even among the medical profession – many GPs don’t know anything . about it,’ she said. ‘I can’t live the life I used to but I have  to . look at the positives and hope  that one day I will wake up and jump out . of bed.’","Nicola Whitehill has Raynaud's phenomenon and systemic sclerosis .

Fresh allegations have emerged that 1973’s infamous ‘battle of the sexes’ tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs was thrown by Riggs to settle an $100,000 gambling debt with the mob. The event, which took place on Sept 20 1973, was one of biggest media events of its day and King’s impressive victory was widely credited with striking an impressive blow for the women’s liberation movement. Despite being 55 at the time, retired tennis champ Bobby Riggs was expected to comfortably beat Billie Jean King, then 29 and the world’s No. 2 female player. Scroll down for more . Victory for the fairer sex? Did Billie Jean King win the 'battle of the sexes' fair and square or was the match thrown by Bobby Riggs to settle gambling debts . Ego talk: Billie Jean King has dismissed the latest allegations that the infamous tennis match was throw . Four months earlier, Riggs had easily dispatched with the women’s No. 1 Margaret Court. Instead, Riggs lost 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 to King before a stunned audience of 30,472 fans at the Houston Astrodome. The attendance is still the largest crowd in the U.S. to ever attend a tennis match and millions more watching on TV. The outcome has repeatedly been dogged by claims it was fixed or the result was thrown, something Riggs repeatedly denied until his death in 1995. But now almost 40 years after the event, a man has come forward with new allegations that he overheard mob bosses discussing the plot - apparently Riggs' idea - which was set to net them lucrative takings from bookies. Hal Shaw, left, has told ESPN that he overheard mobsters discussing fixing the 'Battle of the Sexes' tennis match won by Billie Jean King in 1973 . In the early 1970s, Hal Shaw worked as an assistant golf instructor at the Palma Ceia Golf and Country Club in Tampa, Florida. Now aged 79, Shaw has told ESPN’s ‘Outside the Lines’ that he overheard mob attorney Frank Ragano, Florida mob boss Santo Trafficante Jr. and New Orleans crime boss Carlos Marcello discussing the plan late at night at the club. 'Ragano was emphatic,' Shaw told ESPN. 'Riggs had assured him that the fix would be in - he would beat Margaret Court and then he would go in the tank' against King, but Riggs had promised that he would 'make it appear that it was on the up and up.' According to Shaw the mobsters said Riggs wanted his gambling debts with them be paid off in return for throwing the game. 'Ragano says, ""Well, he's going to [get] peanuts compared to what we're going to make out of this, so he has asked for his debt to be erased,'"" Shaw said. Shaw claims he overheard mob attorney Frank Ragano and other mobsters discussing the plan for Riggs to thrown the match . '(He) has also asked for a certain amount of money to be discussed later to be put in a bank account for him in England.' Shaw said he waited 40 years to come forward with his revelation because he wants to set the record straight . 'There are certain things in my life that I have to talk about, have to get off my chest,' Shaw said. 'It's been 40 years, OK, and I've carried this with me for 40 years… The fear is gone… And I wanted to make sure, if possible, I could set the record straight — let the world know that this was not what it seemed to be.' Larry Riggs, Bobby’s son, told ESPN that his father did know mafia figures and that 'it’s possible' they talked about fixing the match, but said it was more likely his father lost with the intention of setting up a rematch and an even bigger payday. Riggs was 77 when he died on Oct. 25, 1995, but just months before his death he said: 'People said I was tanking, but Billie Jean beat me fair and square' King also remains skeptical that her opponent threw the match. Riggs was an overwhelming pick in Las Vegas and bookies could barely entice any action on King, despite long odds. 'People who were unhappy - guys who lost money,' she told ESPN. 'And a lot of people, men, particularly, don't like it if a woman wins. They don't like it. They make up stories. They start just thinking about it more and more. It's hard on them. It's very hard on their egos.' Riggs was 77 when he died on Oct. 25, 1995, just months before his death he said: 'People said I was tanking, but Billie Jean beat me fair and square. 'I tried as hard as I could, but I made the classic mistake of overestimating myself and underestimating Billie Jean King.'

It’s the property with a £1.5million price tag where a homage to Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara taking pride of place. The five-bedroom detached house in London belongs to the country’s most famous socialist firebrand George Galloway, who is set to make a distinctly capitalist £1million profit from its sale. The three-storey property was purchased by the politician for a snip at £220,000 almost 20 years ago in 1995. He is has now set to make a 600 per cent profit on the house after putting it on the market for a hugely increased £1.5million. The large red-brick townhouse, located on a quiet tree-lined street in Streatham, south London, boasts five double-bedrooms, three bathrooms and a huge 70ft garden. It is filled with expensive antique furniture, plush rugs, chandeliers and four poster beds. But despite these luxurious touches, the interior still bears hall marks of the left-wing MP’s presence. One of the most telling clues is the framed black and white photograph of the Che Guevara, which hangs over a Victorian fireplace in the politician’s home office. Mr Galloway has often spoken of his admiration of the Argentinian guerrilla fighter, describing him as his hero and professing to be a ‘soldier in Che Guevara’s army’. Another sign that Mr Galloway owns the property is the two oversized wooden ‘G’s’ that act as bookends for a row of books just below this picture. In the same room the MP for Bradford West, who has often been the subject of press interest, also has a framed picture of a newspaper frontpage. Another personal touch in the master bedroom is a white heart-shaped frame hanging by ribbons from a chandelier above the four poster bed. Grand: George Galloway's large house in Streatham . Dangling within this white heart is a photograph of the same shape which appears to contain an image of a married couple - quite possibly the Scottish politician and his fourth wife. The 59-year-old, who celebrated his birthday on Friday, tied the knot with a Dutch-born consultant Putri Gayatri Pertiwi – 31 years his junior – in an Islamic ceremony in March last year. And giving hints of Mr Galloway’s middle-east connections, also mounted over the bed is a framed depiction of Arab script in gold leaf. The pictures of the rooms are part of selection that have been posted on a property website which states the price tag for the home as a hefty £1.475,000. Meanwhile, the house is described as : ‘A beautiful and rarely available detached family home extending to over 3000 Sq Ft. Set back from the road the property benefits from off-street parking, large garage and 70’ mature and secluded garden. Internal accommodation comprises a large double reception room, separate kitchen, five double bedrooms, three bathrooms and a bright and beautiful galleried central landing.’ The upmarket home is worlds apart from Mr Galloway’s birthplace in Scotland - an impoverished tenement in the Irish quarter of Dundee. The veteran politician bought the three-storey property just a year after he returned from a 1994 visit to Iraq where he pledged his support for Saddam Hussein with the memorable words: ‘Sir, I salute your courage, your strength, your indefatigability.’ Firebrand: Galloway is famous for his revolutionary socialist views . In 2010 the MP was forced to tighten up security at his South London home over suspicions that a homeless person taken up residence there while he was away in Egypt. He became concerned after his aides reported that his ties and shoes had been moved from room to room. And teetotal Mr Galloway said his fears that someone had moved in upstairs were confirmed when he went to investigate wielding a sword and found an empty bottle of gin and gay video in a closet. ‘I have a sword, given to me in Saudi Arabia or somewhere,’ Mr Galloway said at the time of the incident. ‘So I unsheathed my sword and went upstairs. ‘There was no-one there, but there was a bottle of gin - which, of course, would never be in my house - and a gay video, which definitely would never be in my house.’ Estate agent Dexters confirmed they were selling the property but refused to discuss any further details.","George Galloway has put his London home on the market with a 600 per cent mark-up .

Ed Miliband was dealt a twin blow last night after two former allies launched devastating attacks on his leadership skills. Lord Glasman, the political ‘guru’ who was rewarded by Mr Miliband with a Labour peerage, said it was time he showed he was sufficiently ‘grown-up’ to become Prime Minister. And rebel MP Tom Watson, who quit over the Labour seat-rigging scandal in Falkirk, said Mr Miliband was wrong to have called in police, and had caved in to pressure from David Cameron over the issue. Devastating attacks: Lord Glasman, left, said Ed Miliband had to prove he was 'grown-up' enough to be PM, while rebel MP Tom Watson, right, said the Labour leader was wrong to call in police over the Falkirk scandal . Significantly, both men questioned Mr Miliband’s leadership qualities and said he must admit to economic blunders made by Gordon Brown’s Government, in which he was a senior Cabinet Minister. Writing in today’s Mail on Sunday, Lord Glasman said the Labour leader had failed to produce the policies needed to get Britain’s economy back on track. ‘At the very time when Labour should be showing the way ahead, it gives the impression of not knowing which way  to turn. ‘When the Labour battle  bus should be revving up, it is parked in a lay-by of introspection.

Militant hunt saboteurs have vowed to disrupt the start of badger culling by infiltrating animal rights groups planning peaceful protests. Police have increased patrols in the countryside fearing violent clashes between farmers and hardcore opponents when the cull begins, which could be as early as today. More than 500 protesters are expected, with even some of those planning to demonstrate peacefully saying they are prepared to run from footpaths into the line of fire of the farmers culling the badgers to force them to put down their arms. Protest: The sign yesterday outside an anti-cull camp near Watchet in Somerset . But others are veterans of the anti-hunt sabotage campaigns. The cull is an attempt to tackle bovine tuberculosis which is transmitted by badgers and has led to the death of 305,000 cattle in the UK over the past decade. Farmers say the cull is the only way to protect their livelihood and the Government has approved trials in West Gloucestershire and West Somerset that could see as many as 5,000 badgers killed. Police have said militant campaigners have infiltrated local campsites and have been spotted patrolling farmers’ fields wearing balaclavas at night. One group, Bristol Hunt Saboteurs, said it would trespass on to sites with large horns to scare the badgers away and remove bait left by farmers. It comes as a protester was arrested yesterday for allegedly trying to break in to a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs site in Stroud, Gloucestershire. Joe Mossman, of Bristol Hunt Saboteurs, said ‘extensive research’ had been carried out to find out where the badgers’ setts are and where peanut bait had been laid by farmers. He added: ‘The intention is to just turn up in large numbers, making lots of noise, getting in the way and having a massive presence. We will try to locate the shooters, which will involve trespass if necessary. Controlling disease: 5,000 badgers could be killed in two trials culls . ‘Spoiling bait is one of the  most effective ways you can sabotage the cull, because if the bait’s not there the badgers won’t be drawn away.’ Dozens of people have also set up a camp, dubbed Camp Badger, on the outskirts of the sleepy harbour town of Watchet, Somerset. Mostly members of campaign group Stop The Cull, they intend to carry out nocturnal patrols looking to document evidence of wounded badgers. Protest: Animal rights groups say badgers should be vaccinated instead of culled . Carla Kidd, 39, a gardener from Penzance, Cornwall, said: ‘If it came down to it and I was in the killing zone, then yes, I would run in front to try and stop the shooting. That would be my natural reaction.‘It’s your natural instinct to protect an animal as if it was a pet or your own child.' 'Our intention is to carry out peaceful protest while on patrol at night and stick to the footpaths, but I couldn’t say that I’d stick to that if I saw culling. Our main task is about raising awareness.’ Miss Kidd added that protest groups had been buoyed by recent anti-fracking protests in Balcombe, West Sussex, when hundreds of activists were able to stop exploratory drilling temporarily. The past 15 years has seen a boom in bovine TB which is spread to cattle when badgers urinate on grass which is eaten by cows. The trial scheme is due to continue every year for the next four years, and is predicted to cut bovine TB by 16 per cent. Two . companies have been given the licence to carry out the culling in the . counties, but both Defra and Natural England, the public body . responsible for the operation, have kept their identities a secret in . case activists target them directly. Last . week the National Farmers Union was granted an injunction in the High . Court barring anti-cull activists from approaching farmers’ homes, . business premises and cull sites.

A married army general could face jail over charges that he forcibly sexually assaulted a female captain . All the sordid details are coming out during a military trail in Fort Bragg, North Carolina where the army is court-martialling Brigadier General Jeffrey Sinclair, one of its generals, for just the third time in fifty years. On trial: Brigadeer General Jeffrey A. Sinclair faces court martial on charges that include forcible sodomy and adultery . It was a volatile love affair that lasted for three years during which time the captain called her boss ‘Poppa Panda Sexy Pants.’ Brig. Gen. Jeffrey A. Sinclair, an . Army Ranger and paratrooper is accused of forcible sodomy, adultery and . other charges that could land him in prison. Prosecutors . say he abused his authority by sleeping with a subordinate officer . which is a taboo in the armed forces and a violation of military law. The charges also suggest that the relationship became violent when he attempted to force the Captain to perform oral sex. There are also some additional charges that allude Sinclair had inappropriate communications with three other female officers. Sinclair has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Rare court-martial: The general will be tried at the end of September of sex assault charges . On patrol before being on trial: Brig. Gen. Jeffrey A. Sinclair served as a special assistant to the Commanding General, XVIII Airborne Corps . Well traveled: Sinclair has been deployed to combat in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan but could now face jail time after conducting a sordid affair with a Captain 17 years his junior . The case is being seen as a test of how well the U.S. military handles allegations of sexual assault. President Obama recently demanding a crackdown after a host of scandals and admissions by military leaders. Sinclair’s trial begins at the end of September but before then, the army is selecting a jury of five major generals, all men, who will decide his fate. 40 generals have so far been summoned to the military base to see if they are suitable to be included on the jury. Almost all of the generals that were questioned said they believed  sexual assault was a serious problem in the ranks. Although Sinclair has pleaded not guilty, his attorneys have acknowledged that he carried on an affair with a subordinate officer 17 years his junior. Serious charges: The Army has charged Sinclair with forcible sodomy because of the oral sex allegations. More than 100 witnesses have been involved in the investigation . Reputation: The Army is trying to shelve its reputation of being awash with cases of sexual assault. 40 generals have been questioned so far to see if they could sit on the jury for Sinclair's upcoming trial . During a pretrial hearing last year, the woman testified that the pair had sex in the general’s quarters in Iraq, in her car in a German parking lot, in an office in Afghanistan and even on a hotel balcony in Arizona. The affair may well have remained a secret however the  general and the captain  ended up bombarding one another with explicit and angry text messages. The Washington Post has revealed how one read: ‘You are my heart and world you beautiful magnificent man,’ whilst the captain texted the general, ‘I need you and I mean really deeply profusely need you.’ There was also a darker side to the affair where the captain threatened to kill herself or expose Sinclair to his superiors. The affair exploded out into the open when in Kandahar, Afghanistan, in March 2012, the captain was snooping through Sinclair’s e-mail in his office and discovered loving messages to his wife, as well as love notes to another female Army officer. The captain has admitted she flew into a jealous rage first firing off an e-mail to the other female officer, saying, ‘I hope you don’t think you’re the only girl that he’s sleeping with.’ Witnesses: More than a 100 people have been interviewed in connection to Sinclair's affair, many of whom had turned a blind eye whilst the relationship was developing . Uniquely understanding: Rebecca Sinclair, wife of General Jeff Sinclair said last year that she understood why her husband had an affair and agreed that the the strains of war had lead to infidelity . Then she entered the office of Maj. Gen. James L. Huggins, then the commander of the 82nd Airborne Division and leader of all U.S. forces in southern Afghanistan and spent two hours confessing to the affair. Phonecalls and emails followed amongst the army’s top brass and a full investigation was launched that spoke to more than 100 witnesses. The became even more serious when the captain accused Sinclair of sexual assault by forcing her to perform oral sex against her will on two occasions in Afghanistan. The Army charged Sinclair with forcible sodomy because of the oral sex allegations. The captain testified that the assaults occurred between December 2011 and February 2012 but said she cannot recall the exact dates. Defense attorneys have accused her of making up the assault allegations to save her Army career. They said she first told one confidant that the relationship was entirely consensual but gave investigators a different version after she realized that she, too, could be kicked out of the Army for adultery. Sinclair also is charged with having inappropriate relations with three other female junior officers. In November, Sinclair’s wife, Rebecca, stunned many in the Army when she wrote an op-ed column in The Washington Post to declare that she was sticking by her husband and that she blamed his infidelity on ‘the stress of war.’ Mrs Sinclair said her husband may be a cheater but not a violent abuser. ‘I don’t excuse my husband’s bad behavior or bad judgment,’ she said. ‘I never said it’s okay. I said I understand how it could happen.’ Although she has not attended most of the court proceedings, she said she’s still living with the general. ‘We’re doing the best we can,’ she said. ‘It’s draining.’","Affair lasted for three years between the general and a Captain who was 17-years younger .

While promoting his new film in a television interview Friday, actor Forest Whitaker discussed the recent incident in which he was accused of shoplifting at a New York City market and took the opportunity to address New York City’s stop and frisk policy and racial politics in America in general. While talking about The Butler, a film that revolves around America’s civil rights movement and also stars Oprah Winfrey, film critic Peter Travers asked the 52-year-old what it felt like to be the victim of racial profiling despite his many successes. ‘I was angered,’ said Whitaker, who is black, in the interview which aired on ABC. ‘It’s a humiliating thing for someone to come and do that. It’s attempted dis-empowerment.’ Scroll down for video... Profiling: Critic Peter Travers' question about Whitaker's false shoplifting accusations gave the Oscar winner a chance to address st-and-frisk policies and race politics in general . Modest: Instead of directly addressing Travers' questions about the February incident, Whitaker took the chance to suggest America shift the tide of racial profiling . But the modest Oscar winner was quick to turn the topic from himself to the problem of racial profiling in general. ‘Most of the stop and frisk,’ began the actor, though Travers had asked only how Whitaker felt about his own false shoplifting accusation. ‘Nine out of the ten, the person is not a criminal. They don’t ticket them, or they don’t arrest them. 99 percent of them don’t have a weapon. So I think there’s something that has to be examined.’ Whitaker did eventually get around to discussing his own brush with racial profiling, but would only say how he turned it into a positive. Co-stars: Whitaker stars in The Butler with Oprah Winfrey, who was herself the victim of racial profiling by a Swiss saleswoman who refused to sell her a purse . ‘It’s attempted disempowerment,’ he said. ‘And for me it just spurred me into action.’ The vehicle for that action, Whitaker said, came in the form of his PeaceEarth Foundation which, according to a foundation video, seeks to build inroads toward peaceful resolutions in areas of conflict around the world. The shoplifting snafu occurred in February, when Whitaker was perusing the aisles at the Milano Market in Manhattan’s Upper East Side when an employee approached him and made the accusation, according to TMZ. The worker then frisked the Last King of Scotland actor in front of the other customers as if he was a lowly thief. Not surprisingly, the employee turned up no contraband on Forest's body, and the actor left the story in a fury. Five finger apology: A worker at Milano Market on the Upper East Side falsely accused Whitaker of stealing . 'Frisking individuals without proof/evidence is a violation of rights,' Whitaker's rep told TMZ at the time. The statement continued: 'This was an upsetting incident given the fact that Forest did nothing more than walk into the deli. 'What is most unfortunate about this situation is the inappropriate way store employees are treating patrons of their establishment.' The actor took the higher ground and didn't call the authorities on the employee, instead reasoning with the store manager to 'change their behavior' and 'treat the public in a fair and just manner.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:28 EST, 17 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:35 EST, 18 August 2013 . Sales of liquor are to be restricted on Navy bases to try to reduce sexual assaults and other crimes, the leading Admiral has said. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert has ordered a series of changes to the way alcohol is sold on bases, including a ban on sales in its mini marts and restricted selling times at other stores. 'It's not going to fix everything, but it is a real step in the right direction,' David Jernigan, Johns Hopkins University's director of the Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth, said. Last orders: Sailors will be restricted from buying alcohol overnight on bases . 'Historically, the military, as elsewhere, has viewed these problems as individual problems to be dealt with by identifying the individual with the problem. While that's important, the research shows it's much more effective actually to look at it as a population problem and to deal with things that are affecting everybody across the population,' he said. The changes, which include not selling alcohol between 10pm and 6am, are the latest addition to a broader alcohol education and awareness program that appears to have had some success. Throughout the Navy, the number of alcohol-related criminal offenses dropped from 5,950 in 2007 to 4,216 last year. The number of DUI offenses dropped from 2,025 to 1,218 during that same period, according to Navy Personnel Command. Liquor will still be sold on U.S. bases at a discount of up to 10 per cent for what it can be bought at a regular store, but sales will be limited to dedicated package stores or exchanges that sell a variety of items. At Naval Station Norfolk, the main exchange is comparable to a small shopping mall that sells clothing, electronics and jewelry, among other things, at a discount. At smaller naval bases, the exchanges are not as sprawling but still often have the feel of big-box retail. While hours at those stores vary, most are open between 9am and 9pm. Restricted: Alcohol will be stacked at the back of the building in larger stores on bases, such as the NEX in Norfolk, Virginia . The Navy's minimarts at the Norfolk base currently start selling liquor as early as 6am - four hours earlier than people can buy it at Virginia's state-run ABC stores off-base. Mr Jernigan said a preference among young people for distilled spirits over beer and wine means the Navy's moves could be helpful. 'Reducing the availability of one kind [of alcohol] is a step in the right direction, but you can certainly get just as impaired from drinking beer and wine as you can from distilled spirits,' he said. Last year, the Navy reported $91.9 million in distilled spirits sales, compared with $39.3 million in wine and $62.3 million in beer. The Navy uses 70 per cent of the profits from its sales of alcoholic and non-alcoholic products to support morale, welfare and recreation programs. Admiral Greenert has ordered the exchanges to display alcohol only in the rear of its stores. The new rules are set to take effect by October. His order on alcohol sales was issued the same day last month that the Navy announced other initiatives to prevent sexual assaults. Measures include hiring more criminal investigators and installing better lighting on bases. The effort follows a Pentagon report, released in May, that estimated as many as 26,000 service members may have been sexually assaulted last year. Curbed: The Navy is trying to restrict access to beer and other drinks to reduce crimes . Alcohol is often involved. In a survey, 55 per cent of Navy women said they or the offender had consumed alcohol before unwanted sexual contact. Navy officials said they were not trying to keep sailors from drinking rather, they wanted them to do so responsibly. The Navy is already holding random alcohol-detection tests when sailors report for duty, and soon the devices will be found on store shelves for personal use. The single-use product will sell for $1.99. Mr Jernigan suggested the Navy may want to end discounts for alcohol, just as it did with tobacco. Not all sailors believe the new rules will help. 'If people are going to drink, they're still going to buy it wherever,' Seaman Bryan Free told Associated Press, as he bought a bottle of vodka from a Naval Station Norfolk gas station. 'So if they take it out of here, it's not going to do nothing because they're going to go to the package store right out of base. That's usually where everybody gets it. So it doesn't really matter.' Variety: Currently sailors are able to buy a wide range of drinks and other goods at base stores, such as the Main Exchange in Norfolk . Robert Parker, a University of California at Riverside sociology professor who has studied the links between alcohol and crime, said restricting on-base alcohol sales should help even if there are places to buy it nearby. 'If you make something like alcohol harder to get, you restrict the hours, you restrict the places it can be bought, then generally consumption goes down in that community or that area because people have a lot of things to do in addition to buying alcohol,' he said. 'There will be some individuals that will be determined no matter what, and they'll travel 100 miles to buy a six pack, but most people won't do that,' he added.","Rules to curb drinking habits as Admiral battles to lower DUI offenses .

The central government has informed all states, including Delhi, to conduct regular surveillance of poultry farms after outbreaks of avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, in Chhattisgarh and Bihar. Considering the outbreak of the avian influenza H5N1 virus in the two states, the Ministry of Agriculture's Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries has recently informed the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Union health ministry, Union home ministry and all the states to carry out regular checks to enable early detection of any possible spread of the virus. According to officials, the reasons for the outbreak in Chhattisgarh this month, and in Bihar in March, and the factors that help spread it include fluctuating temperatures, poor hygiene conditions at the poultry farms and lack of adequate surveillance. Fears: The government has ordered all states and authorities to make regular surveillance to prevent a serious outbreak of bird flu . Conditions: Poor hygiene and lack of proper checks are thought to have caused recent outbreaks of the disease, as well worsening conditions due to a heavy monsoon . Past problems: The first reports of bird flu in India came from the village of Nawapur, in Nandurbar district of Maharashtra, on February 19, 2006 . The same conditions, exacerbated by a heavy monsoon, may give rise to the infection in Delhi as well. Around 200 trucks of chicken reach Delhi wholesale markets daily to cater to the demands of the city and NCR areas. First outbreak . In March 2013, when the first outbreak took place in Purnea, Bihar, the government and the Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries took several steps, declared India Avian Influenza free, but at the same time called for surveillance. ""India has declared itself free from Notifiable Avian Influenza on 15 June, 2013. It is, however, emphasised that regular surveillance is to be continued throughout the country, especially in the vulnerable area bordering countries and in areas visited by migratory birds,"" stated a letter by R S Rana, joint secretary, Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries. ""Delhi may also be in a bird flu-prone zone as migratory birds from other countries fly here. Nepal, which is already in the grip of bird flu, is nearby and birds can fly over 1,000 kilometres to warmer climes. They may also be carrying the virus,"" said Dr V K Monga, former chairperson of the health committee of the erstwhile Municipal Corporation of DelhiMCD). Monga, a public health expert, is also president of the organisation Prevention of Public Diseases in India. ""Moreover, Delhi has badly organised poultry farms with the least monitoring. The people handling bird excreta, saliva and other waste products should be very careful,"" he said. Two months after the government declared the country ""Avian Influenza free"", the virus again crept into Jharkhand, resulting in an outbreak. The government has kept the NDMA in the loop as well. ""We have been informed about the outbreak by the agriculture ministry. In case the Centre or state governments need any help from us, we are ready to extend it. ""Moreover, last time, during outbreaks of swine flu and bird flu we issued advisories to state governments. ""Local health authorities though have a bigger responsibility in terms of surveillance and control. We are ready to coordinate with them,"" said NDMA vice-chairman Shashidhar Reddy. A ministry of agriculture letter of this month marked ""Most Immediate"" confirms bird flu in poultry originating from the ""Poultry Production Unit, College of Veterinary Sciences and Animal Husbandry, Anjora, Durg"" and ""Government Poultry Farm, Jagdalpur"". Both farms are in Chhattisgarh. The Delhi government is also preparing proper surveillance plans, according to the ""Action Plan of Animal Husbandry for Preparedness, Control and Containment of Avian Influenza"", circulated by the Central government. ""We will be having a meeting soon on the issue and we will carry out extensive surveillance programmes in the city. We will take all necessary action and direct all the concerned doctors to take precautionary measures,"" said Dr A K Walia, health minister, Delhi government. The first reports of bird flu in India came from the village of Nawapur, in Nandurbar district of Maharashtra, on February 19, 2006. Villagers had then reported a large number of bird deaths in the village. After bird flu was confirmed, at least 253,000 birds and 587,000 eggs were destroyed within five days.","Bird flu outbreak in Chhattisgarh sparks fears disease will spread .

Four years later, victims of the Fort Hood massacre got the opportunity to speak about the physical and emotional toll the shooting spree had on their lives. Survivors of the attack and relatives of those killed at Fort Hood testified Monday during the sentencing phase of Major Nidal Hasan's trial. Prosecutors hope the testimony helps convince jurors to impose a rare military death sentence on Hasan, who was convicted last week of killing 13 people and wounding more than 30 others at the Texas military base. Staff Sgt. Patrick Ziegler was one of the 30 injured in the attack and among the first to testify Monday. Sgt .

Because he's paralyzed, he can't play with a son like a . normal father. Survivor: Staff Sgt Patrick Ziegler was shot by Maj Hasan that day and became severely paralyzed . While he is . hopefull that he will gain more movement, he said he will eventually . succumb to his wounds and 'won't be able to function.' Widows . and parents of those who were killed also testified today, proving that . Maj Hasan left a wake of destruction much larger than the 13 he killed, . and 30 he injured. Jennifer . Hunt had only been married to her husband Spc Jason Hunt for two and a . half months when he was shot to death by Maj Hasan. Too soon: Jennifer Hunt had only been married to her husband Spc Jason . Hunt for two and a half months when he was shot and killed by Maj Hasan. She says his death caused her to attempt suicide twice . She says her daughters have taken it a lot better than she has. 'I pretty much lost my mind for a while,' she said. 'I got suicidal. I had two suicide attempts.' For Juan Velez, Hasan not only killed his daughter, but his unborn grandchild. Double the loss: Juan Velez, center, spoke through an interpreter today about losing his daughter Pvt Francheska Velez, and the unborn grandchild she was carrying . Loss: Shoua Her's story about how she lost her husband, 23-year-old Kham Xiong, brought one male juror to tears . 'That man did not just kill 13 that day. He killed 15. He killed my grandson and he killed me that day,' said Mr Velez, with the aid of an interpreter. His daughter Private Francheska Velez, 21, was pregnant when she was shot. According to reports, Pvt Velez pleaded with Hasan to not kill her, and spare her child's life. Shoua Her wiped away tears as she recalled how her husband, Pfc Kham Xiong, talked about growing old together and having more children. Now, she said, her three children only know their slain father through memories or stories. 'I miss him a lot,' she said. 'I miss . his soft, gentle hands. How he holds me. He made me feel safe and . secure. Now the other side of the bed is empty and cold. I feel dead but . alive.' As she testified, one juror, a male officer, fought back tears. The jury is made up of 13 high-ranking military officers. Another . woman, Angela Rivera, was widowed when Hasan killed her husband - Maj . Libardo Eduardo Caraveo. Maj Caraveo was the father of five, three of . whom were still young and living at home. Another widow: Angela Rivera's husband Maj Libardo Caraveo had arrived at Fort Hood the day before to deploy for Afghanistan when he was shot and killed . Her husband had only arrived at Fort Hood the following day, right before he was due to deploy to Afghanistan. For a long time, her only comfort was keeping her husband's cellphone on just so she could call it and hear his voice. And she wasn't the only one. She would see the missed calls from other family members doing the same thing. Father killed: Maj Caraveo left behind five children, and three still living at home . Mrs Rivera testified to something her 12-year-old daughter told her: 'Mom, I hope who did this understands the pain he has caused all these families.' Other widows, mothers, children and siblings of the slain were expected to tell the jury about how their loves ones and describe the pain of living the last four years without them. Two more soldiers who suffered debilitating injuries also were scheduled to testify about their struggles since the attack. What they won't be allowed to do is talk about their feelings toward Hasan or what punishment they think he deserves. Terror: In this image released by the U.S. Army, wounded are prepared for transport in waiting ambulances outside Fort Hood's Soldier Readiness Processing Center Thursday, Nov. 5, 2009, in Fort Hood, Texas . Attack: U.S. Army post police take cover as a gunman fires at the Soldier Readiness Processing Center November 5, 2009 at Fort Hood, Texas. Thirty were wounded in the deadly rampage at Fort Hood that left thirteen dead . Hasan, an American-born Muslim, has admitted carrying out the attack and showed no reaction when he was found guilty. He is representing himself during his trial, yet he called no witnesses, declined to testify and questioned only three of prosecutors' nearly 90 witnesses before he was convicted. It remained unclear Monday whether he planned to say anything during the trial's sentencing phase. The judge, as she has done repeatedly, asked Hasan on Monday if he wanted to continue representing himself. She went through a series of questions that appeared to be aimed at getting on the record that Hasan was adamant about remaining in charge of his own defense. 'The defense rests': Accused Fort Hood shooter Major Nadal Hasan refused to defend himself in court . 'You understand that this is the stage of trial ... you are staking your life on decisions you make. You understand?' the judge, Col. Tara Osborn, asked. 'I do,' Hasan said.

A hunter in the remote wilds of Alaska has been rescued in an elaborate mission by the Alaska Air National, 36 hours after he was mauled and nearly killed by a grizzly bear. The man was on a hunting trip with a guide north of Anatuvuk Pass, Alaska, nearly 300 miles from the nearest city when he was attacked and severely injured on Wednesday. A trained medic who happened to be with a nearby hunting party was able to stabilize him and minimize blood loss. Dense fog descended on the area and hampered air evacuation efforts by local rescue teams and the Alaska State Police. The man was on a guided hunt in the wilds of Alaska, hundreds of miles from civilization, when he was attacked and nearly killed by a grizzly bear . The 11th Air Force Rescue Coordination Center learned of the man's plight Thursday, about 36 hours after the attack and mounted a massive rescue effort with personnel from the Air National Guard. The man, whose name was not released, had suffered severe blood loss and other injuries and was at risk of drying in the remote wilderness if he was not evacuated to a hospital. Officials credited the medic who first treating his wounds with saving the man's life. 'He was able to decrease the blood loss and maintain life until help could arrive,' said Master Sergeant Armando Soria, a search and rescue controller with the coordination center. 'He provided expert care with limited resource for several hours, ultimately stabilizing, warming and rehydrating the victim.' No details about the bear attack were released. High-flying: The rescued required an Air Force HC-130 plane to refuel the HH-60 Pave Hawk rescue helicopter in mid-air - a maneuver similar to the one pictured in this stock photo . The Alaska Air National Guard sent a search-and-rescue plane carrying a helicopter crew from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson near Anchorage. They landed at Eielson Air Force Base near Fairbanks, where a helicopter had been prepared for them. Together, the plane, an HC-130 search and rescue aircraft, and helicopter headed more than 280 miles northwest to the victim. The plane's crew launched illumination flares to guide the HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopter through Anaktuvuk Pass and to help find the site. The man was trapped in such a remote area that the HC-130 plane had to refuel the helicopter in mid-air during the flight, between cloud layers. The helicopter reached the victim before 3am Friday. The man was brought to the Air Force base just before 5am, then taken by ambulance to Fairbanks Memorial Hospital. He was listed in stable condition there Saturday.","Man was on guided hunting trip 300 miles from civilization when he was attacked and nearly killed .

The concession follows accusations that Bashar Assad's regime is responsible for a chemical attack which killed more than 350 people - many of them children - on Wednesday. Syria has denied that it is to blame while many Western officials claim the . poisoning was caused by a chemical agent used in a rocket attack carried . out by government forces. Scroll down for video . Agreement: Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem pictured right with UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Angela Kane as the country agreed weapons inspectors may visit sites where the chemical attacks happened on Wednesday . Negotiations: UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, Angela Kane, has been pushing for weapons inspectors to be able to access the site since the chemical attack on Wednesday . Ongoing conflict: Black columns of smoke rise after heavy shelling in the Jobar neighborhood, east of Damascus, Syria, today . Under fire: The heavy shelling came just hours after Syria reached an agreement with the United Nations to allow a UN team of experts to visit the site of alleged chemical weapons attacks outside Damascus . A statement released by the Syrian government said: 'The Syrian government and the United Nations agreed on a common understanding ... to allow the United Nations to investigate allegations of chemical weapons use in the Damascus suburbs.' Many hundreds of people were poisoned to death on Wednesday before dawn in what appears to have been the world's worst chemical weapons attack since Saddam Hussein's forces gassed thousands of Iraqi Kurdish villagers in 1988. The incident took place just three days after a UN chemical weapons team arrived in Syria to investigate other smaller allegations of poison gas use. The inspector team's movements must be agreed with the Syrian authorities. Chemical attack: Aid organisations claim the more than 350 people - many of them children - died after being exposed to neurotoxins in Arbeen town, Damascus, Syria, this week . The two leaders want to send a clear warning to dictator Bashar Al-Assad over the deaths of as many as 1,300 people, many of them children . The Syrian statement said that the date . and time of the inspectors' visit to the site had been agreed, but it . did not say when it would take place. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem met UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Angela Kane - who was in Damascus to negotiate access - this morning. Moualem stressed 'Syria's readiness to cooperate with a team of investigators to uncover false allegations by terrorist groups that Syrian troops used chemical weapons.' U.S. President Barack Obama and top advisers are debating options for responding to the reported use of chemical weapons in Syria amid what Britain called 'increasing signs' that the Syrian government was responsible for the attack. Warning: Iran has warned the U.S. President Barack Obama, pictured on Friday as he walked across the South Lawn of the White House, of 'severe consequences' should America cross the 'red line' on Syria . President Obama appeared on CNN's 'New Day' on Friday to discuss the alleged attack, saying it was a 'big event of grave concern' that requires American attention . A senior U.S. government official told . Reuters: 'Based on the reported number of victims, reported symptoms of . those who were killed or injured, witness accounts, and other facts . gathered by open sources, the U.S. intelligence community, and . international partners, there is very little doubt at this point that a . chemical weapon was used by the Syrian regime against civilians in this . incident. 'We are continuing to assess the facts so the president can make an informed decision about how to respond to this indiscriminate use of chemical weapons.' Meanwhile Iran has warned the United States it will face 'severe consequences' if it crosses the 'red line' on Syria. Deputy chief of staff of Iran's armed forces Massoud Jazayeri said: 'America knows the limitation of the red . line of the Syrian front and any crossing of Syria's red line will have . severe consequences for the White House.' Prepared: Chuck Hagel, right, says the President has ordered the Pentagon to prepare potential military options . David Cameron and Barack Obama discussed the plan in a 40-minute phone call at the weekend and will finalise the details within 48 hours . President Obama has been holding talks with David Cameron over the growing crisis in Syria. The Prime Minister and the U.S. President discussed the conflict by telephone last night and have ordered officials to examine 'all options'. A Downing Street spokesman said the leaders spoke for around half an hour. 'They are both gravely concerned by the attack that took place in Damascus on Wednesday and the increasing signs that this was a significant chemical weapons attack carried out by the Syrian regime against its own people,' he said. 'The UN Security Council has called for immediate access for UN investigators on the ground in Damascus.

'They agreed that it is vital that the world upholds the prohibition on the use of chemical weapons and deters further outrages. They agreed to keep in close contact on the issue.' President Obama previously suggested that the use of chemical weapons in Syria would be a 'gamechanger'. But he has stopped short of committing to direct intervention in the troubled country - a step that would risk inflaming tensions with Russia. Mr Cameron would also face domestic resistance to military action, with Tory MPs already having insisted there should be a Commons vote before arms are supplied to rebels. Bloody conflict: Medical charity Medicin Sans Frontieres said hospitals in Syria treated thousands of people for symptoms of inhaling nerve gas . Accusations: The Syrian opposition has accused the government of carrying out a deadly chemical attack on its own people .

Battle: The bloody civil war continues to rage - pictured, an injured Syrian army soldier is evacuated following heavy clashes with rebels . However, there is speculation that the U.S., Britain and France could back limited airstrikes to demonstrate that deployment of chemical weapons will not be tolerated. Mr Cameron also spoke to Canadian PM Stephen Harper, who agreed that the 'international community must respond appropriately'. Medecins Sans Frontieres said hospitals it supports in Syria treated some 3,600 patients with 'neurotoxic symptoms', 355 of whom died. It said the patients had arrived in three hospitals in the Damascus area on Wednesday. Staff described people suffering from convulsions, extreme salivation, contracted pupils and sight and respiratory problems.

It was the day when all that was good reigned over all that was bad in the life and death of murdered Australian baseballer Chris Lane. Hundreds of friends - those who had played with him as a kid to old folks on walking sticks who had watched his sporting progress - gathered today on 'Laney's' field of dreams in Melbourne where his sporting life as a catcher had taken off. His family and friends had shed tears all week since the day they learned that Chris had been shot randomly in the back as he jogged through the streets of Duncan, Oklahoma, on August 16. Remembered: A tribute game was held in Melbourne Sunday afternoon to celebrate the life of slain Australian baseball player Chris Lane . But today there was more joy than sorrow at a life remembered as red and black balloons, in the colors of the Essendon club that Chris had formerly played for, were released, bearing his player's number 40. Boredom: Lane was gunned down while out on a jog in Oklahoma where he was attending school on a baseball scholarship. The teens who shot him did it because they were 'bored' His girlfriend, 22-year-old Sarah Harper, flew from the US to be there for the tribute game. Chris's parents, Peter and Donna were there. His sisters, Erin, Andrea and Jennifer were there, along with Andrea's baby daughter. So, too, were all his former clubmates but equally touching was the presence of strangers who didn't even know Chris but who felt the need to drop by and share the tribute being paid by hundreds of others who turned out to watch the Essendon Club play Melbourne University. His parents hugged those who waited patiently in a bitter winter's wind to pass on memories of their son before some of those who gathered allowed a few tears to fall as senior and junior players walked onto the field and stood with caps against their chests while the American and Australian national anthems were played. Chris's parents, forcing back tears . which tried to well up, spoke of their strong and talented son, but . agreed that while they would never stop looking back at his life, it was . also time to look to the future. Referring . to the trauma that the Lane family and friends would have to face as . details of his murder are played out through the US courts, Mr Lane . said: 'Distance isn't going to change the size of the task ahead, but we . still have three beautiful daughters and we have grandchildren. 'They . need to pick themselves up each day and get on with their lives. Whatever task you need to do, you get up each day and you have to move . forward.' He . and his wife, he said, as they stood on a windy hill overlooking the . field where Chris had played so often, had been moved by the 'tremendous . tributes', particularly as their son had been in the US for four years. Lost son: Chris' parents, Peter and Donna Lane, hug during the memorial service held today at the Essendon Baseball Club where Chris used to play baseball before attending East Central University in Oklahoma . 'So many people have been prepared to roll out and support him. He was much loved, but I have never doubted that for a minute. 'It's . nice to have so many people come here, so many family faces, kids Chris . played under-11s with and who maybe gave up the game when they were . under 12. They knew what a guy he was when he was in 11 and 12.' But . it was the girl he had met and loved - Sarah - who Peter and Donna . acknowledged was 'quite a girl'. He described her as 'an outstanding . kid, with such a strong personality and temperament' and it was . important for her to be in Australia at this time 'because we will hang . together.' Donna described . her as a 'beautiful, gorgeous, strong young woman' who carried Chris on . from the upbringing he had received in Australia when he had been . surrounded by strong women in his family. Sarah . had decided to allow his club friends and his parents do all the . talking today but she said through officials that she was deeply moved . by the tribute match, in which all the players wore black arm bands. Grieving girlfriend: Lane's girlfriend Sarah Harper, left, flew out to Australia to attend the tribute game. She didn't speak at the event but told officials she was moved by the black arms bands worn by the players . Torn apart by tragedy: Lane's mother said she was glad that girlfriend Sarah Harper made it out for the game and described her as a 'beautiful, gorgeous and strong young woman' Alleged killers: James Edwards Jr, left, and Chancey Luna, right, are being charged with the first degree murder of Lane. Their friend Michael Jones is facing accessory to murder charges . President Barack Obama has sent his thoughts and prayers to Chris' family, saying through a spokesman that 'there is an extra measure of evil in an act of violence that cuts a young life short,' but Mr Lane said he did not want to get drawn into a political discussion about America's gun laws. 'I have said at the start that we are not buying into gun control, punishment, race issues or any such thing. 'Our kid died in horrible circumstances and that is not going to be solved by me standing here making statements about the American political system or anything like that. I'm not buying into any of these other issues.' Like many traumatic moments, players said they would always remember what they were doing when they heard the news that Chris had been gunned down, reportedly by three bored teenagers who had allegedly set out to murder someone - and he was the anonymous target they had picked. Word had spread rapidly from a single phone call from the US - and within hours most of Chris's friends had heard. Dean Mackintyre, the team pitcher, heard just before a game last weekend. They continued playing, but their hearts weren't in it, he said. Memorable player: The players from Essendon and Melbourne University baseball clubs release red and black balloons - the Essendon team colors - in tribute to fallen player Chris Lane . Salute: Tribute game players watch their memorial balloons set off into the cloudy gray sky . 'He was such a good mate and I went into deep shock when I heard about it,' said Dean. 'He was just one of the boys, always enjoying himself. I remember when we lost a grand final on one occasion we all ended up with terrible hangovers on a hotel room floor - good job we didn't win!' Josh Davies, the team's shortstop, was on holiday with a group of friends in the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales when they received the news. 'It put a total dampener on the holiday, of course. It was straight out of the blue.' Gary O'Brien, 58, leaning on a walking stick, told how he had watched Chris progress through the club and said he knew that he would go far. 'It's so tough to think that his life has been cut down like this,' he said. 'I'm still trying to come to terms with it' Steve Morris, the club's vice-president recalled watching Chris play as a junior at the age of seven. 'He was playing in a tournament and he was so tired afterwards - having put in so much effort - that his dad had to carry him to the car. 'He went on to play Australian rules football for three clubs, winning the ""Best and Fairest"" award on one occasion. That's the kind of guy he was.' As sausages sizzled and people lined up for coffee from a mobile kiosk - typifying a weekend Aussie family gathering for a community-conscious club - the last word came from Chris's father, referring to a newspaper story about his son's murder. 'A front page calling him a baseball star - he would have loved that because he never saw himself that way. There have been quite a few things he would have taken the micky out of. Me crying for a start. 'He would have told me to toughen up!' Staying strong: Chris' father Peter Lane said at the Sunday tribute game that his son would have wanted him to 'toughen up'","Chris Lane was shot and killed August 16 while jogging in Oklahoma by 'bored' teens .

An ex-con opened fire on a train in New Jersey and wounded two passengers - and then himself - after becoming enraged when a stranger objected to him falling asleep on her shoulder, police said today. Tari Turpin, 34, pulled out a 9mm Glock semi-automatic pistol and started shooting aboard a PATH Train in Jersey City, New Jersey, on Sunday morning. He shot one woman in the ankle and hit another in the hand. Then, he accidentally shot himself in the leg, according to reports. None of the injuries were life-threatening. Turpin was riding the train with his girlfriend and their two children at the time, WABC-TV reports. The TV station spoke to Diamond Drummer, who said Turpin was falling sleep on her on her ride home from New York City about 5.10am. When she asked the man not to lean on her, he became furious and pulled out his pistol and racked the slide, Ms Drummer said. Her brother, who was riding in the train car with her, intervened and convinced Turpin to put the gun away. The shooting happened aboard a PATH Train in Jersey City, New Jersey, about 5.10am on Sunday. It restricted service on the New Jersey-to-Manhattan trains for several hours . Ms Drummer said she then remarked, 'Who pulls out a gun for something like this?' That's when Turpin started firing, Ms Drummer told WABC. He fired several shots, striking Ms Drummer in the ankle. He hit another passenger, Aubree Marshall, in the hand. The gunfire ended when Turpin wounded himself in the leg. All three were taken to the Jersey City Medical Center for treatment. The shooting happened aboard a PATH Train while other passengers were in the car . PATH train service between Journal Square in Jersey City and Hoboken, New Jersey, was suspended in both directions for three hours.

Men may be able to protect their fertility from the effects of ageing by simple tweaks to their diet. Those with a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, fish and nuts showed fewer signs of damage to the DNA of their sperm in a study than those who avoided these foods. Nutrients in these foods could  be the key, said scientists in California. Juice boost: Men over 40 who follow a diet rich in Vitamin C, which can be found in citrus fruits, as well as Vitamin E, zinc and folate may increase their chance of fatherhood . Previous research has shown that the older a man is, the more chance he has of DNA fragmentation and chromosomal rearrangements in his sperm. These can lead to a higher chance of being infertile or having children with a disability. But a diet rich in Vitamins C  and E, zinc and folate could protect the DNA – especially for those above the age of 40. Professor Simon Fishel, managing director of CARE Fertility Group and one of the world’s leading fertility specialists, said that men who are struggling to father a baby should not underestimate the impact that diet could have. ‘Diet can have good and bad effects,’ he said. ‘Compounds called free radicals can have a damaging effect on cells, and they can concentrate  in the testes. Go nuts: Eating fruit, vegetables, fish and nuts means the sperm's DNA is less likely to suffer age-related damage . Some of the nutrients, such as Vitamin C, whether from food or supplements, can mop them up and prevent damage. Others, such as zinc, play a role in the integrity of sperm. ‘But what we eat can also be damaging. Oestrogen-like compounds that slip into the food chain, through meat,  for example, can have a damaging effect on the development of sperm.’ Some 3.5 million couples in the UK may have difficulty conceiving, according to the NHS, and it is estimated that 25 per cent of infertility in couples is due to poor-quality semen, the fluid containing sperm. Men’s sperm quality can also fall as they age. Although fertility treatment can  be highly successful, it is expensive and lengthy, and researchers have been increasingly looking  at whether compounds in the food we eat can help. The latest study showed that men aged over 44 with the highest intake of Vitamin C found in  foods such as oranges, peppers, strawberries, broccoli and potatoes had 20 per cent less damage to their sperm DNA than men who did not eat these foods. It was a similar situation for those with a high intake of zinc, found in fish and shellfish; Vitamin E, found in nuts and seeds; and folate, which is present in leafy greens.","Eating fish, vegetables and nuts prevents sperm aging .

Plans by police in London not to arrest shoplifters who take goods worth less than £50 have been scrapped after being branded a ‘looters’ charter’ by shopkeepers. Police in Hammersmith and Fulham – home to the Westfield shopping centre, Britain’s worst shoplifting hotspot – said that the radical scheme would allow them to focus on more serious offences. Officers told businesses and town hall bosses they should deal with low-level crimes themselves rather than calling 999. Crime hotspot: Westfield Shopping Centre in White City, west London, where police were planning to drop arrests on small-time shoplifters . But representatives of the West London council and retailers reacted with fury. Greg Smith, deputy leader at Hammersmith and Fulham Council, said: ‘Anyone who steals is a criminal – full stop. They will face the full force of the law in our borough.’ Conservative MP Michael Ellis, who sits on the Home Affairs Select Committee, added: ‘Such a policy would be akin to a looters’ charter.’ Scotland Yard admitted that  a sergeant in the borough had made the suggestion during a meeting with council officials and business leaders. A pilot scheme was due to take place across Hammersmith and Fulham and would have meant shop assistants and security guards apprehending suspected shoplifters with less than £50 worth of goods themselves rather than calling for police assistance. Vulnerable: The plans meant that shops would be left to deal with their own suspected thieves . But the Metropolitan Police insisted this was not official force policy and dismissed the plan as unworkable. Mr Smith added: ‘We are pleased that the local police have rejected this barmy idea.’In last week’s report on crime hotspots, we said that Judkin Court in Cardiff had a high level of drugs offences. In fact, the crimes were recorded at the nearby Cardiff Bay police station, when offenders were arrested and found to have drugs on them.

Hannah Anderson has braved the cameras once again, thanking her supporters for rallying around her and her father as she copes with the murders of her mother and little brother and her kidnapping by a close family friend. Hannah, 16, appeared noticeably nervous around the camera as she made an appearance Saturday at a car wash organized in her hometown of Lakeside, California, by her high school friends to raise money to help her cope with her ordeal. Her father revealed that 'ever moment' is a struggle for the girl, who was rescued just last week from 40-year-old James DiMaggio, who kidnapped her and took her 1,000 miles from her home to the Idaho wilderness.

She said she wanted to thank everyone was who helping her . Hannah's watchful father Brett stands by his daughter as she mingles with her high school friends, who are raising money to help support her . Her appearance was brief and it was clear that she wasn't entirely comfortable being followed by the camera from KNSD-TV. However, she did offer thanks to her supporters when asked . When asked by KNSD-TV if she had any words for her friends and supporters in the community she responded: 'Just, thank you.' Her father told the TV station that his daughter is still learning to cope with the trauma she endured. 'Right now, she just wanted to come out and thank these people personally,' Brett Anderson said. 'It's very difficult. Every moment is difficult for her.' Police said they consider Hannah 'a victim of every sense of the word' after she was rescued last week from an encampment in the remote River of No Return Wilderness in Idaho after FBI agents shot dead her captor - 40-year-old James DiMaggio. DiMaggio was a trusted family friend, who Hannah and her eight-year-old brother Ethan referred to as 'Uncle Joe.' Police say he lured Hannah's mother Christine and her brother Ethan to his home and then bound, tortured and killed them. He then shot the family dog before burning his house down. On Friday, sheriff's spokeswoman Jan Caldwell reiterated previous statements made by Sheriff Bill Gore, who unequivocally said that Hannah ‘was not a willing participant.' var nbcLP={};nbcLP.aRandomNumber=Math.floor(Math.random()*10000);nbcLP.currentPageLoc=encodeURIComponent(window.location.href);nbcLP.currentSiteLoc=encodeURIComponent(window.location.host);nbcLP.defaultWidth=652;nbcLP.defaultHeight=367;nbcLP.cmsID=""220059881"";nbcLP.vidPid=""n85_bUOjlAkt"";nbcLP.vidSec=""TK"";nbcLP.vidSubSec=""TK"";nbcLP.vidFrame=document.getElementById(""nbcLP220059881"");nbcLP.vidFrame.style.border=""none"";nbcLP.vidFrame.width=nbcLP.defaultWidth;nbcLP.vidFrame.height=nbcLP.defaultHeight;nbcLP.vidFrame.scrolling=""no"";nbcLP.vidFrame.src=""http://www.nbcsandiego.com/templates/nbc_partner_player?cmsID=""+nbcLP.cmsID+""&videoID=""+nbcLP.vidPid+""&width=""+nbcLP.defaultWidth+""&height=""+nbcLP.defaultHeight+""&sec=""+nbcLP.vidSec+""&subsec=""+nbcLP.vidSubSec+""&turl=""+nbcLP.currentSiteLoc+""&ourl=""+nbcLP.currentPageLoc+""&rand=""+nbcLP.aRandomNumber; . Murdered: Hannah's mother Christine and eight-year-old brother Ethan were tortured to death and murdered by Hannah's kidnapper James DiMaggio . Hannah Anderson was spotted sneaking into a fundraiser being held for her dead relatives on Thursday . Make way: The 16-year-old was ushered into a back door of the Lakeside, California restaurant where community members had gathered to help raise money for funeral costs . Suddenly silent: Hannah did not speak on Thursday and she has set all of her social media accounts to private . ‘As Sheriff Gore said earlier in the week, Hannah is a victim in every sense of the word,’ Caldwell said in an email to the Los Angeles Times. ‘Our follow-up investigation has not changed that sentence.’ On Thursday, Anderson stepped out in public for the first time since she was rescued by federal agents less than a week ago. The . 16-year-old wore sunglasses, a blue top and short jean shorts as she . attended a fundraiser with friends and supporters in Lakeside, . California less than a week after her ordeal ended. It . comes as questions remain over what exactly happened when she was . kidnapped by James 'Uncle Jim' DiMaggio, a family friend who killed her . mother and 8-year-old brother before abducting her and taking her to . Idaho where FBI officers shot him dead. Many . questions remain about the timeline of events on the day when Christina . and Ethan Anderson were killed: why did Hannah exchange 13 calls with . DiMaggio in the hours leading up to the attack? How exactly were they . killed? And how was DiMaggio able to restrain and kill them without . Hannah knowing before they drove off together? Police have not explained any of these . issues publicly, but they have released the search warrants filled out . by investigators at DiMaggio's house, listing pages of evidence that . they took with them to help piece together his relationship to the . Andersons- and Hannah in particular. San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore has been adamant that Hannah was an unwilling victim from start to finish. ""I can't make it any clearer,"" he said at a news conference Monday. She . has spoken to friends and strangers over social media and released a . number of pictures of herself via her Instagram account but the first . time she was seen publicly came Thursday evening when she went to a . fundraiser for her family. Her . mother Christina and 6-year-old brother Ethan were killed and their . bodies were set on fire by their family friend Jim DiMaggio, who . 'tricked' them into coming to his home and then killed the mother and . brother before running off with Hannah and being shot dead six days . later. Hannah was only briefly seen walking from their car into the back entrance of a San Diego restaurant where the fundraiser was being held. Support: Her father said that she is happy to be home and among friends . Hannah's appearance at the fundraiser comes . the same day as a growing list of evidence recovered at DiMaggio's . house has been revealed, including firebombs, military assault rifle . ammunition, and handwritten 'letters from Hanna' to DiMaggio. One . of the most puzzling pieces added to the ongoing investigation into . this crime is that a DNA test kit was found in the burnt out car that . once belonged to Christina Anderson. NBC News reports . that other items listed in the search warrants released today include . 'crow bars and other weapons, instruments and objects capable of . inflicting blunt force trauma', as well as bomb-making materials like . gas cans, various types of duct tape and arson wire. A . number of personal items that could potentially be used for DNA . collection were also gathered, including clothing and toothbrushes but . also used condoms. The meaning behind the items was not listed, as emergency responders appear to have grabbed as many items as possible on August 5 as they tried to get a better idea of Hannah's relationship with DiMaggio as they were missing. What remained: Firefighters found the bodies of Christina and Ethan Anderson covered with tarp, showing that they were killed before the fire that burnt down Jim DiMaggio's Boulevard cabin (pictured) The 13 calls between DiMaggio and Hannah on the day of her abduction remain curious, though San Diego County sheriff's spokeswoman Jan Caldwell said that they may have been discussing what time she needed to be picked up from cheerleading practice. Today, Hannah . did not make a statement to the awaiting press, but her father Brett . Anderson came outside and made a statement, saying that his daughter was . happy to be home. 'She's with her family and of course with some friends and she's just happy to be here,' he said Thursday. 'Hannah sends her love and she keeps moving day by day.' The fundraiser was largely attended by relatives and friends within their neighborhood, and Mr Anderson cited their strong support as helping them through. 'This is a small community that we're a part of and they really came together... This is how Lakeside rolls,' he said. He also said that he has spoken with the four horseback riders who spotted Hannah in the Idaho woods with DiMaggio and called police. 'It was a chance encounter but it did save my daughter's life,' he said. Father turned spokesman: Brett Anderson stepped outside and said a few words, telling how he was so thankful for the national support that helped lead to his daughter's rescue . Spreading the love: Brett said he spoke with the four horsemen who spotted Hannah with DiMaggio and called police, leading to her recovery . The fundraiser came the day after a search warrant revealed that Hannah's mother and brother were both killed and tortured before DiMaggio's cabin set on fire. A police report that describes the scene that firefighters found when they responded to the call about DiMaggio's cabin being burnt to ashes in Boulevard, California on August 5th. They found the bodies covered with tarp, and a crowbar lying next to Christina. When the responders went to the garage to check for more victims, they found the Anderson's deceased dog and noted that it had blood near its head. The details surrounding the nature of the bodies are scant, but the fact that the humans were draped with tarp before the firefighters got there- and that there was blood coming from the dog's head- implies that they were all killed before the fire ravaged the home.","Abduction victim was seen attending a fundraiser for her family, making it her first  public outing since being freed less than a week ago .

She is the star of some of the world's best-loved children's books, but as she approaches her 60th birthday Miffy the little white rabbit is to get a 21st century makeover. Miffy was created in 1955 by Dutch artist Dick Bruna and her adventures have now sold some 85 million books which have been translated into 80 languages. With a hugely successful toy range and last year's foray into cinema with a feature-length film, she is now worth an estimated £150m. 21st century rabbit: The much-loved Miffy books are to be revamped to appeal to a wider audience . Publisher Simon & Schuster announced a number of MIffy Books books, starting with Miffy, Miffy at the Gallery and Miffy at the Zoo will be updated 'to appeal to a modern British audience'. Mr Bruna, 86, has always stuck to a rigid formula with the books. Most contain sixteen pages of story with one illustration and four lines of verse per page. Dutch artist Dick Bruna created Miffy during a rainy holiday in 1955. She is now worth an estimated £150m . The last word of the second line always rhymes with the last of the fourth and they always have a happy ending. Some books, such as Miffy's Dream, have no text at all. Simon & Schuster have recruited award-winning poet Tony Mitton to revamp the original rhyming verse. Simon & Schuster Editorial Director Meg Wang said: 'Generations of British children grew up with Miffy – and now as parents, are introducing this loveable and iconic character to their own children. 'Dick Bruna's stories explore the extraordinary wonder of everyday things in a child's life – which have proven to be both timeless and universal. 'We're thrilled to be bringing Miffy to a wider audience in the UK with brand new activity and novelty books, while also introducing a new generation to the classic Miffy stories through the newly-translated hardbacks.' Mr Bruna created Miffy during a rainy seaside holiday in North Holland. He entertained his young son by sketching a little bunny in the garden of their holiday house, and making up stories about it every evening.","Loveable white rabbit was created in 1955 by Dutch artist .

For Charissa Garner, it was love at first sight. ‘I’m quite an instinctive person and whenever we drove past the house, I always dreamed of living there,’ she says. ‘We had our home on the market and then I saw an advert for The Manor House in the paper. I rang our estate agent and said, “You have to sell our house in three weeks!” He said, “Mrs Garner, you have to  be realistic.” But I’m not that kind of woman at all, and he did sell it in that time.’ The Garners now want a home nearer their children’s schools and are selling the seven-bedroom property – in the village of Blofield, just east of Norwich – for £1 million. Best bar none: Charissa Garner with her son Zachary at The Manor House at Blofield, Norfolk, which had been owned by the Mackintosh sweets family for generations . Charissa, 40, and her husband Neil, 41, who owns an IT communications business, bought the house from the Mackintosh confectionery family, who had owned it for generations. In the garden, outside the dining room, is  a ‘cocoa wheel’ from the first Mackintosh factory, which would have been used to crush cocoa beans. Toffee and chocolate used to be made in the kitchen and tested on local schoolchildren. The Mackintosh family, which is best known for brands such as Quality Street, developed what we now know as toffee, by blending brittle English butterscotch with soft  American caramel. Before this, the word ‘toffee’ had been used to describe any kind  of boiled sweet. The family was also the first to turn chocolate-making into a mass-distribution business so that buying and eating chocolate was no longer just for the rich. They did this by importing cocoa beans at lower costs. Sweet days: The seven bedroom property outside Norwich also features a cocoa wheel from a Mackintosh factory . Millie Mackintosh, star of E4 reality programme Made In Chelsea and fiancee of rapper Professor Green, is the current heir to the Mackintosh family fortune. She has commented on how much her family loves cooking. So it is fitting that  her family’s former home is now owned by an equally enthusiastic cook, who not only has a herb garden and greenhouses full of tomatoes but keeps chickens for their freshly laid eggs and has planted a garden of wild garlic. The idea of Mackintosh chocolates having been being made  in their house is appealing to Charissa’s children – Talia, ten, Romilly, six, and Zachary, one. But they also adore the house in its own right. Charissa says their friends are always eager to visit. It is no wonder, as aside from the enormous size of their bedrooms there is a secret passage that runs from the en suite bathroom down to a swimming pool and sauna area. The en suite itself has a sash window with views of the garden. Cameron Black, managing director of Fine & Country Norwich, says: 'The Manor House is one of the most beautiful and unique homes I have seen come to market in Norwich over the past few years' ‘It’s lovely to lie in the bath and watch the birds in the trees by the window,’ Charissa says. There is a large balcony attached to the master bedroom where, Charissa adds, ‘we sometimes sit with a glass of wine when the children have gone to bed’. For the children, there is a zip wire to play with in the garden as well as a swing, not to mention the three acres of land the Garners own in total. The Garners have had the house, which . dates from 1784, extensively renovated. And if they didn’t need to move . for schooling, they would set about converting the coach house into a . new kitchen. Charissa says: . ‘I love interior design and I’ve done a lot of property renovation over . the years. My dad’s a builder so that’s helped, and I’d love to do some . more renovation projects once the children are older.’ Star link: Nowadays the former owners are famous for more than Quality Street thanks to the heiress to the toffee fortune Millie Mackintosh starring in Made In Chelsea . As an indication of how skilful her overhauling of the house has been, she opens up her husband’s study, which has not been redecorated. In spite of its double aspect, the moss-green carpet and brown walls make it seem dismal when compared to the light and tasteful decor in the rest of the house. Cameron Black, managing director of Fine & Country Norwich, says: ‘The Manor House is one of the most beautiful and unique homes I have seen come to market in Norwich over the past few years. ‘When I recount the wonderful history to viewers, it makes their faces light  up and feel like the house is truly  special – which it is. As soon as you walk up the drive, you know it is an impressive house. ‘Aside its chocolatey past, the location of The Manor House  is incredibly sought-after – Blofield village has access to all aspects of Norwich via  the A47, allowing you to get to the centre of town in ten minutes. ‘It also has numerous outbuildings, which  is getting rarer and rarer these days and  a big differentiator in  the market. ‘We have sold a couple of houses in the area at about £1 million, so I am confident this house will sell quickly. ‘The current market and summer weather is bringing out a much  more positive result in serious buyers and faster sales.’ Fine & Country Norwich, fineandcountry.com, 01603 221888 .","Seven bedroom Norwich property in the market for £1million .

Sweet tooth: Mel Giedroyc revealed that she puts on three quarters of a stone every year when she presents the Great British Bake Off . Resisting the temptation of sweet treats can be difficult at the best of times. But if you work on a cookery programme, surrounded by freshly baked goods, it seems saying ‘no’ is almost impossible. Mel Giedroyc revealed yesterday that she puts on three quarters of a stone every year when she presents the Great British Bake Off. The 45-year-old, who hosts the culinary contest with fellow comic Sue Perkins, admitted gorging on cakes, bread and quiche. And with the aroma of up to 12 tasty offerings being baked at once in the early stages of the competition, it is easy to understand why. Miss Giedroyc said yesterday: ‘I’ve put on a good 11lb every series. The first couple of episodes it’s, “No thank you, not for me”. 'Cut to the semi-final and we’re hoofing up whole quiches.’ In an interview with the Radio Times, she revealed the BBC2 show’s production team had invested in heated belts to prevent judge Mary Berry from getting too cold, but added that the devices helped to ‘keep your stomach in’. The programme, which is in its fourth series, is recorded in a tent in the grounds of Harptree Court, Somerset, and was last year marred by terrible weather, forcing the crew to come up with inventive ways of dealing with the cold. Miss Giedroyc said: ‘When we first started filming, in April, it was freezing so our main concern was to keep Mary Berry warm. She had four thermal layers on and two water bottles down the trousers. Team: Miss Giedroyc is pictured with her fellow Bake Off presenters Paul Hollywood (bottom left), Mary Berry (bottom right) and Sue Perkins (top left) ‘This year we discovered these marvellous heated belts called “hot trusses”. I was a big fan. They keep your stomach in as well, which is useful as the series goes on.’ They are stodgy and sticky and most definitely not for dieters. Thanks to the recession, old-fashioned puds like jam roly-poly are back on the menu at mealtimes. Demand for school dinner-style dishes has rocketed as families turn to comfort over style – driven by our economic woes and the latest restaurant trends for retro desserts. A report by Trade magazine The Grocer yesterday revealed that sales of traditional puddings like spotted dick have climbed 42 per cent in a year. The latest data on the UK’s £169million a year hot puds market shows that bread and butter pudding is up 15.2 per cent while crumbles have enjoyed growth of 13.2 per cent. Supermarket chain Asda has seen a 9.4 per cent rise in sales of puddings. The Grocer said: ‘Billy Bunter would be proud. Britain is rediscovering the kind of traditional, school dinner-style puddings that gave him his figure. Downturn-driven nostalgia and comfort-eating are clearly playing their part.’ Paul Watmore, of food manufacturer Ambrosia, said ‘proper puddings’ are emotionally satisfying in a way that a yoghurt can never be. Miss Berry, 78, revealed another downside to sampling food on the show, saying she has grown sick of cake. But she need not worry about the impact on her waistline, for she chooses clothes that are extra roomy to allow for layering. She was praised for her style when she wore a Zara floral bomber jacket last year, but writing in the Mail yesterday, she said she only chose it because there was ‘lots of room under there for warm layers’. ‘I get immensely cold while filming as the wind blows through the break in the side of the tent, so the crew always get me long-sleeved thermal underwear,’ she said. Not only that – she also keeps two hand warmers in her jeans back pockets.","Mel Giedroyc, 45, presents Great British Bake Off with comic Sue Perkins .

'This is what she wanted to do when she was younger, and even today. Make candles, soaps, etc. She loves this. She hated her old job as a banker and she hated retail. I want her to be happy.' 'Buying from her website would mean a lot but I am not asking you too (sic)' Selling out: Danielle's mother's small online business, Suffield Sundries, sells artisan candles and soaps and is hosted on the e-commerce crafts site, Etsy .

Jerry Remy is a former Red Sox second baseman who has been a color analyst on team broadcasts on the New England Sports Network since 1988. He has been battling lung cancer in recent years, but has stayed on as the Red Sox announcer. NESN said Friday that he will be off the air through next weekend. Hulk: Jared Remy, pictured, appears at Waltham District Court for his arraignment, Friday, August 16, 2013 . Remy posted a link to his Twitter account containing his brief statement on the allegations against his son . Jerry Remy said Saturday that his thoughts and prayers go out to the victim's mom and her family. Also on Saturday, Martel's uncle, Richard Martel Jr, said in an interview with Good Morning America that Thursday's tragedy did not come to him as a surprise given the number of red flags in her relationship with Remy. Warning signs: Jenifer's uncle, Richard Martel Jr, said he had predicted that her relationship with Remy would not end well . ‘He never let her go out anywhere, he wanted her for himself,’ he said. ‘She's dead now, and I predicted it to my friends.’ Police arrived at the residence in the Windsor Village apartment complex . at around 9.30pm Thursday following multiple 911 calls.

Middlesex Assistant District Attorney Lisa McGovern said Remy attacked Martel in the kitchen, in the living room and on a stairway before pinning her to the ground of the patio where he stabbed her repeatedly. 'Great force and great effort was made by this defendant in stabbing Miss Martel over and over and over again' McGovern said, labeling the attack a 'protracted struggle.' Remy, a hulking muscle-man, was arrested at the scene after he held his hands over his head and surrendered to officers. His clothing was soaked with Martel's blood and, according to WBZ-TV, he had an engagement ring in a sunglasses case in his pocket. Just feet away lay Martel's body, shirtless and covered in blood with stab wounds to her front left shoulder area as well as wounds to her neck. A blue cloth covered her face.

'And that's why he killed her, because she called the cops on him.' At least one neighbor, Benjamin Ray, in the apartment complex rushed to Martel's aid and tried to pull Remy off her. But he was driven back when Remy waved his knife in Ray's direction, McGovern said. 'It's not an easy thing to watch. It's not an easy thing to try and stop,' Ray told Boston.com. 'I did what I could to stop it. And it wasn't enough.' Witnesses told police they saw Remy 'on top of Miss Martel stabbing her repeatedly with the knife' on the patio.

Hospitals have been accused of conning the public with bogus claims about the quality and choice of food on offer to patients. NHS hospitals claim their own studies show that 99 per cent of patient meals are rated ‘good’ or ‘excellent’. However, new figures from the care watchdog published today show that around half of patients feel hospital food is not good enough. Only 55 per cent felt the meals were ‘good’. Hospitals have been accused of conning the public with bogus claims about the quality and choice of food on offer to patients . And some hospitals are spending as little as £2.94 a day to provide three meals to patients – a figure which seems to be indicative of poor quality. Campaigners claim nutrition and quality standards are below those for prisons and Whitehall department restaurants which must adhere to mandatory levels. In some NHS trusts, such as the Heatherwood and Wexham Park, which serves Ascot, Maidenhead, Slough and Windsor, less than four in ten rated the food as ‘good’, placing it bottom of the league of patient satisfaction. However, a survey of staff at its hospitals rated the food, which is prepared by outside contractors, as excellent. Other low scores were given to the Medway NHS Foundation Trust in Kent, and the South London Healthcare NHS Trust, which includes Queen Mary’s hospital in Sidcup. The research also reveals that there is little correlation between the amount of money spent on meals and their quality. For example, Heatherwood and Wexham Park trust spends a relatively high figure of £13 a day per patient, yet it came bottom on patient satisfaction. The lowest spending to provide three meals to patients was at the Gateshead Health NHS Foundation Trust, where the figure was just £2.94. Only 52 per cent of patients said the food was good, however hospital staff said the quality and range was excellent. In some NHS trusts, such as the Heatherwood and Wexham Park, which serves Ascot, Maidenhead, Slough and Windsor, less than four in ten rated the food as 'good' Other low spending trusts were the Shrewsbury and Telford trust at just £3.65 a day, and Heart of England trust at £3.80 and the Homerton trust in East London at £3.82. The trust which spent the most on food was Barts in London at £15.65 a day, however the proportion of patients who rated the food as good was just 48 per cent. The figure at the South Tees trust was £15.47 a day – five times higher than the nearby Gateshead hospitals. At South Tees, the proportion of patients who rated food as good was 60 per cent. The damning figures were released by the Campaign for Better Hospital Food, which is supported by 97 organisations, including the Royal College of Physicians, British Heart Foundation and the Patients Association. All are calling on the Government to support a change in the law that would improve all patient meals by requiring them to meet mandatory standards, including quality and nutrition. Campaign co-ordinator, Alex Jackson, said: ‘It is time for the Government to come clean about the sorry state of hospital food in England and set mandatory standards for patient meals. ‘This would only involve extending an existing policy which has seen it set mandatory standards for prison food and food served in government departments, to go alongside those that already exist for school food. ‘Surely patients recovering in hospital have the same right to good food as government ministers, school kids and prisoners?’ The Unison union, whose members work in hospital kitchens, claimed that meals produced in-house were generally a higher quality than those from outside contractors. Its deputy head of health, Sara Gorton, said: ‘While costs vary, it is plain that food cooked fresh on hospital premises scores the highest with patients. ‘Unison is backing calls for set standards for hospital food in England. At the same time we want more hospitals to use kitchens to prepare and cook patient meals instead of bringing in ready-meals from outside.’ The Department of Health rejected the need for minimum legal standards and said the figures, which relate to 2011-12, were out of date. A spokesman said: ‘There are many fantastic examples of really good food across the NHS thanks to forward-thinking and innovative staff. ‘But, we recognise that there is too much variation across the country — that is why we have implemented a tough new inspection programme. ‘With our army of thousands of patient assessors we will drive up standards and reduce variation in hospital food.’ She added: ‘We support the principle of food standards but do not think that legislation is the right way to proceed. ‘We believe that the best decisions on hospital food are those taken locally by chefs and catering managers. Patients are the ones who consume hospital food and they are best-placed to decide what is good and what is not.’","NHS hospitals claim their own studies show that 99 per cent of patient meals are rated ‘good’ or ‘excellent’

A third girl was due to take part in the Peru drug smuggling plot which has seen two British women caught with cocaine worth £1.5million, it has today been reported. The girl, who claims she was enlisted to carry the drugs alongside Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollom Connolly, said she is now in hiding and fears for her life. Both women face up to 25 years in prison after they were caught with the haul at Lima Airport. Melissa Reid (right), 20, and Irish Michaella McCollum, 20, (left) were arrested at Lima's international airport on suspicion of trying to smuggle 11 kilos of cocaine out of the country . Michaella . McCollum Connolly (left) and Melissa Reid . (right) face up to 25 years in prison after they were caught with the haul at Lima Airport . In an interview with the Sunday People the woman - who is in her 20s - says she changed her mind at the last minute and immediately left Ibiza for the UK, reportedly scared of the 'revenge' the plotters may enact. It comes as doubts have been raised about Melissa and Michaella’s story. The women claim they were targeted by Colombian drug gangsters on the party island of Ibiza, who kidnapped them and threatened them with guns as they were forced to fly to Peru. But police on the island say they believe they were acting of their own accord. The third girl says she has been willing to join them on their return trip to Peru, which was arranged by a British man they met in Ibiza reportedly nicknamed The Cockney. She met Melissa shortly after arriving in Ibiza to work for the summer season, and soon the pair were partying together, a source told the paper. They claim that former sales assistant Melissa, from Lenzie, near Glasgow, was heavily involved in the island's drug culture after losing her job at the Ibiza nightspot Millennium Bar. The former friend, who asked to remain anonymous, rubbished the two girls' version of events. He claimed two of Melissa's friends and another man transported cocaine from Majorca to Ibiza in June, and that she was 'so impressed she agreed to take part'. He said she believed the £11,000 she was to be given for her part was 'easy money'. Michaella's legal team said that she was innocent and was kidnapped and forced to carry cocaine. Human-rights lawyer Peter Madden said she is prepared to give full details to the police . He added that she had not been forced into anything: 'If gangsters had really been forcing her to go through with it they would never have let one of the girls suddenly walk away. This wasn’t a case of the third girl achieving some great escape.' The source - who claims he urged her not to get involved -  lived in the same apartment block as Melissa in San Antonio Bay. He said she knew what she was getting involved in. He claims that Melissa had been in contact with a friend while she was away via Facebook, who then tried to delete the messages. The man added that Melissa 'loved the flash lifestyle' and had been partying every night. But both girls deny all of the allegations and all suggestions they were involved in drug taking. Michaella’s legal team said that she was innocent and was kidnapped and forced to carry cocaine. Human-rights lawyer Peter Madden said she is prepared to give full details to the police.

A mother of three today claimed she was told to put on her school uniform and sexually abused as a child by a top British actor. The woman - who is now aged 39, but was 15 at the time in 1989 - said the TV star even recited the nursery rhyme Ride a Cock Horse to Banbury Cross while they were lying on the floor. She told police last year and prosecutors said although there was enough evidence to proceed, a legal loophole meant the alleged attacker could only be charged up to a year after the incident. Abuse claim: The woman is now aged 39 but was 15 at the time of the incident in 1989 (posed by model) The woman, who lives in the South West and cannot be named for legal reasons, said she met the man in a theatre and he told her how ‘sexy’ she was, shortly before she started at a boarding school. The man said the school was near his parents’ house and he would take her out. She then called him in October 1989 after starting at the school, and he said it would be ‘nice’ if she wore her uniform. They met in the local town centre and he allegedly drove her to his home where he gave her wine, before they had sex. He later dropped her back and said ‘see you soon’, she claimed. The woman, who is a civil servant, told the Sunday Mirror: ‘I can’t remember what we spoke about as we sat in the living room but it was there, on the floor, that we had sex. Report: The twice-divorced woman told Surrey Police (file picture of one of the force's police stations) about the incident 24 years later, before they handed over the case to the Crown Prosecution Service . ‘It happened fairly quickly and I was compliant and just let him get on with it. It was clear he knew what he was after. As we had sex he recited the nursery rhyme.’ 'I can’t remember what we spoke about as we sat in the living room but it was there, on the floor, that we had sex' The twice-divorced woman - who first married aged 18 and has attempted suicide twice - eventually told Surrey Police about the incident 24 years later, before they handed over the case to the Crown Prosecution Service. The actor denied the allegations when questioned by officers, but the CPS told the woman in a letter that it was ‘entirely satisfied the sexual assault took place as you described’. However, it added that the charge would have been under the Sexual Offences Act 1956 - and could only have been made against the man if proceedings had started within a year of the allegation. Decision: She eventually made a complaint when Jimmy Savile was exposed as a predatory paedophile in 2012 . The CPS said this law was only relevant to incidents alleged to have taken place before 2004. But if there was sufficient evidence that there was no consent to the act, rape could be prosecuted. 'It happened fairly quickly and I was compliant and just let him get on with it' The woman met her current partner in 2010 and only revealed the abuse to him two years ago after having to leave the room while they were watching a DVD featuring the actor. He told her to tell police, but she did not want to at the time. However she eventually made a complaint when the late BBC DJ Jimmy Savile was exposed as a predatory paedophile last year. She told the Sunday Mirror: ‘What he (the actor) did set the tone around my expectations of men and being used by them. He knew what he was doing and doesn’t care about anybody else.’","Woman says star recited Ride a Cock Horse to Banbury Cross .

Bare-faced beauty: Louise appeared sans make-up in a fund-raising campaign for Children in Need . 'As . you see wrinkles appearing it can be quite aggravating and of course . there are things you can do about them but personally I think it is best . to accept what's happening and make the best of it.' Redknapp, who along with her presenting work has co-founded cosmetics company, Wild about Beauty, added: 'My tips would be to look after your . skin: although my skincare routine is simple, I believe it can still be . really effective. 'People don't need to spend hundreds of pounds on . products and spend hours on a routine - sometimes all you need is a good . moisturiser. 'Also keep your make-up simple. The older we get, less is . definitely [becomes] more.' Redknapp certainly knows about paring down her make-up bag. Last year, she appeared bare-faced alongside Caroline Flack and Lulu to help raise money for Children in Need. Despite the lack of make-up, her fresh-faced, glowing complexion appeared enviably youthful and wrinkle-free, although Redknapp complains that she's had to deal with pigmentation problems and patchy skin since becoming a mother in 2004. Unable to find products to sort out her skin, she turned instead to make-up artist Kim Jacob for help. The result was paraben-free make-up line, Wild about Beauty, and Redknapp is justifiably optimistic about its future. Fresh-faced: Louise Redknapp (pictured with husband Jamie) still looks enviably young at 38 . Business: Louise set up Wild about Beauty with the help of make-up artist, Kim Jacob . Favourite: Louise's hero product is Wild about Beauty Sheer Glow Moisture Tint SPF 20, £19.00 . 'I am very proud to have the business,' she revealed. 'We are still on a journey and have a long way to go. 'Starting up a . company, especially in today's world is tough - it's dog-eat-dog out . there.  Not many businesses even make it into their first year of . trading so I feel very proud that we have been able to get it off of the . ground and into the make-up bags of so many women everywhere. 'My . aspiration is that the company will grow and one day every woman will be . using at least one Wild about Beauty product in their make-up routine.' Her own favourite product is the Sheer Glow Moisture Tint, which along with SPF20, deals instantly with patchy skin. 'It is the one product that really evens my skin out and I can see a difference instantly - I don't leave the house without it,' she enthuses. She also makes a point of being careful about looking after her complexion, although admits that she, like many other working mothers, doesn't have time for a complex routine. 'I don't spend a massive amount of time on my skincare or . make-up routine - I get things done really quickly,' says Redknapp. 'I choose products . that are quick and easy to use so that I don't have to waste too much . time on it all.

But police officers in Seattle have been adding to the fun this weekend by providing snacks at a marijuana festival. The Seattle Police Department descended on the city’s annual Hempfest, which celebrates marijuana culture, to put into action a plan dubbed 'Operation Orange Fingers.' Dangerously cheesy: Police officers at this year's Hempfest festival in Seattle will dish out bags of Doritos with messages outlining the new marijuana laws in Washington . Police notice: Seattle police are keen for cannabis users to understand how the new laws affect users of the drug . In a move to draw attention to marijuana usage rules and restrictions in the state, officers handed out free Doritos with stickers about pot laws stuck on the bags. Each bag displayed a sticker of do’s and don’ts of I-502, Washington’s ballot measure that legalized the possession of marijuana in November. However, it the festival goers already came with the munchiues as Seattle police found themselves running out of their stash of chips within 10 minutes of dolling them out. The stickers instructed Washingtonians to remember to avoid driving while high, giving or selling weed to people under the age of 21, as well as forgoing pot use in public. Cat-snack: One of the lucky festival goers who managed to grab a bag of the chips and who will of course be now far better informed about the new rules . Lining up the chips: Seargent Whitcomb of the Seattle PD hands out the munchies to attendees of Hempfest 2013 . Seattle Police Department's spokesman, Sergeant Sean Whitcomb, said the department wanted to use the opportunity to spread the word about new marijuana laws, by attaching a summarized version to bags of Doritos. The law came into effect in 2012, and allows anyone to legally possess up to an ounce of recreational marijuana. But police are worried people still aren't clear enough on the rules. 'Distributing salty snacks at a festival celebrating hemp, I think, is deliberately ironic enough that people will accept them in good humor,' Seargant. Sean Whitcomb said. 'We want to make sure people learn the rules and that they respect the vote.' The Seattle Police Department has composed its own guide to the law , 'Marijwhatnow?'. “When the laws changed, there was a little bit of an informational vacuum about how police would react,” Whitcomb told nbc news. 'Marijwhatnow' clearly states that Seattle police will not arrest anyone for possessing under an ounce of marijuana, but also outlines the rules that do still exist in the state, and at federal level. Delivery: Police were on scene at 10am on Saturday morning ready to dish out the Doritos complete with informative sticker explaining the new laws . All out: Seattle Police announced that they had run out of Dorito's on their twitter feed in a humorous way . Hempfest is an annual Seattle event where marijuana enthusiasts gather in protest of strict cannabis laws. More than 200,000 people are attending this weekend . A thousand bags of cheesy Doritos were handed out. Seattle's Hempfest is the largest gathering advocating cannabis decriminalization in the world. It takes place over two miles of Seattle parks this weekend. Sergeant Whitcomb was also a due to speak at the three-day event. 'We wanted to do something in a fun way that said, 'look this is cool and everything but the rules are the rules' he said. Can I legally carry around an ounce of marijuana? According to the recently passed initiative, beginning December . 6th, adults over the age of 21 will be able to carry up to an ounce . of marijuana for personal use. Please note that the initiative says it “is . unlawful to open a package containing marijuana…in view of the general public,” so there’s that. Also, you probably shouldn’t bring pot with you to the federal . courthouse (or any other federal property). Where can I legally buy pot, then? The Washington State Liquor Control Board is working to establish guidelines . for the sale and distribution of marijuana. The WSLCB has until December 1, 2013 . to finalize those rules. In the meantime, production and distribution of . non-medical marijuana remains illegal. Can I grow marijuana in my home and sell it to my friends, family, . and co-workers? Not right now. In the future, under state law, you may be able to get a . license to grow or sell marijuana. Can I smoke pot outside my home? Like at a park, magic show, or the . Bite of Seattle? Much like having an open container of alcohol in public, doing so could . result in a civil infraction—like a ticket—but not arrest. You can certainly use . marijuana in the privacy of your own home. Additionally, if smoking a cigarette . isn’t allowed where you are (say, inside an apartment building or flammable . chemical factory), smoking marijuana isn’t allowed there either. Will police officers be able to smoke marijuana? As of right now, no. This is still a very complicated issue. If I apply for a job at the Seattle Police Department, will past (or . current) marijuana use be held against me? The current standard for . applicants is that they have not used marijuana in the previous three years. In . light of I-502, the department will consult with the City Attorney and the State . Attorney General to see if and how that standard may be revised. What happens if I get pulled over and an officer thinks I’ve been . smoking pot? If an officer believes you’re driving under the influence of anything, they . will conduct a field sobriety test and may consult with a drug recognition . expert. If officers establish probable cause, they will bring you to a precinct . and ask your permission to draw your blood for testing. If officers have reason . to believe you’re under the influence of something, they can get a warrant for a . blood draw from a judge. If you’re in a serious accident, then a blood draw will . be mandatory. The Seattle Police Department seized a bunch of my marijuana before I-502 passed. Can I have it . back? No. Will Seattle Police Department assist federal law enforcement in investigations of . marijuana users or marijuana-related businesses, that are allowed under . I-502? No. Officers and detectives will not participate in an investigation of . anything that’s not prohibited by state law. December 6th seems like a really long ways away. What . happens if I get caught with marijuana before then?   Hold your breath. Your case will be processed under current state law. However, there is already a . city ordinance making marijuana enforcement the lowest law enforcement . priority. I’m under 21. What happens if I get caught smoking pot? It’s a violation of state law. It may referred to prosecutors, just like if . you were a minor in possession of alcohol.","Seattle Police Department to hand out bags of Doritos with marijuana laws stuck to them in bid to clarify rules .

Expensive railway fares mean consumers are paying up to three times more to travel around Britain on trains than planes, it was revealed today. Advance air fares are cheaper than train prices on nine out of ten of the most popular long-distance routes between major cities - with the only exception being London to Manchester. For travelling in five weeks’ time on September 23 and returning one week later, flying with EasyJet from Glasgow to Bristol will cost £53 - but the cheapest train ticket is a whopping £141. Up in the air: For travelling in five weeks' time on September 23 and returning a week later, flying with EasyJet from Glasgow to Bristol will cost £53 - but the cheapest train ticket is a whopping £141 . And for Bristol to Edinburgh on the same dates, an EasyJet flight there and back is currently only £62, compared to £149 for a return train ticket with CrossCountry. A similar gap can be seen on the Bristol to Newcastle route, with EasyJet flights costing £43 but the train coming in at £124. It is also much cheaper to fly from Glasgow to Cardiff than take the train. The gap is much smaller for most other routes, although an exception is seen when travelling from London to Manchester, which is £26 on Virgin Trains but £111 by plane with Virgin Atlantic. The routes with similar train and plane prices were London to Edinburgh, London to Inverness, London to Glasgow, Birmingham to Edinburgh, Birmingham to Glasgow and London to Paris. By rail: Advance air fares are cheaper than train prices on nine out of ten of the most popular long-distance routes between major cities - with the only exception being London to Manchester on Virgin Trains . The survey was originally carried out by The Sun on Sunday, but MailOnline has also independently researched the prices using the Skyscanner and The Trainline comparison websites. It’s certainly a reason to call it ‘cattle class’. Train passengers get less space than livestock when being transported, it was revealed today. The Government has assumed that non-seated train passenger occupies 0.25m2 of floor area - about the size of a sofa cushion. Now more than 1,700 new train carriages for services in London and the South East are being built with the thinking that four people can occupy every m2 of standing space. But European Union animal welfare regulations say that at least 0.3m2 must be given to calves and adult goats when transporting them, reported The Sunday Times. Unshorn sheep weighing less than 55kg (8st 9lbs) should have the luxury of between 0.3m2 and 0.4m2. The revelation comes after it was revealed that millions of rail commuters will be hit by crippling price hikes of up to £200 for their annual season ticket, in a move attacked as ‘bad for the economy’. In a bitter blow for passengers, it was announced last week that fares will rise by an average of 4.1 per cent in January, far higher than the pay rise that the majority of workers can expect. Over the past decade, the cost of many annual season tickets for the growing number of workers who commute into London has risen by more than 50 per cent. Skyscanner spokesman Mary Porter told The Sun on Sunday: ‘Our research shows that more often than not, it's cheaper to take a domestic flight than a train. ‘There is now more competition in the skies, particularly with the recent launch of Virgin Atlantic's Little Red, which is operating several domestic routes. More competition usually means better prices for flights.’ Prices for leaving on September 23 and returning on September 30, 2013, checked on Skyscanner and The Trainline today: .

Bad teacher: 38-year-old surf instructor Dylan Greiner was arrested Friday night on suspicion of child molestation . A surf school instructor in Santa Cruz, California was arrested late Friday night on suspicion of 'lewd and lascivious acts' with children. Dylan Greiner, 38, is the owner of the Santa Cruz Surf School, and police say that he has been engaging in inappropriate relationships with children for at least the past four years. Many remember Greiner as a local hero who posted a video drawing attention to the problem of needles on a local beach. But that was changed when two teenage girls, 13 and 14, alerted police that the instructor lured them into relationships by offering free surf lessons. He then proceeded to make sexual advances on the children and videotaped their private body parts. And police believe there may be more victims. An . initial search of Greiner's home and business turned up 'thousands' of . images of young girls, focusing on the 'breasts, buttocks and genitalia . of young girls,' according to Santa Cruz police spokesman Steve Clark. There was even video footage taken of students changing in and out of their wetsuits in the school's dressing rooms. The photographs and footage captured girls as young as 8-years-old. Greiner . admitted to taking the secret changing room video and photographs and . to downloading inappropriate images of teenage girls. He also admitted . to viewing other child pornography.

I'm sorry: After his arrest, Greiner wrote letters to two to of the teenage girls he had a relationship with and the community, apologizing for his behavior . 'Unfortunately, his video skills didn't stop there,' Clark told the San Jose Mercury News. T.J. Magadallanes, who helped Greiner raise awareness about the needle problem was surprised to learn about the surfer's arrest. 'It's sickening. I can't believe it,' he said. 'It was quite a shocker considering he was a local hometown hero.' As of Sunday morning, his Facebook account was still public and friends were taking to his wall to condemn Greiner.

A baby who was born with half a heart and was given just a 50 per cent chance of survival has amazed medics by flourishing - thanks to swimming lessons. Charlie Cobb had to undergo open heart surgery just hours after being born and surgeons warned he might not survive. Even after the surgery, he suffered a huge heart attack, underwent two more operations, and was hospitalised countless times after developing infections. Charlie Cobb was born with half a heart and was given just a 50 per cent chance of survival. He has amazed medics by flourishing - and his mother believes it is thanks to his swimming lessons . But ever since his mother, Louise Bushby, 26, first took him to the pool the one-year-old has flourished. Ms Bushby, a nursery practioneer from Brighton, said: ‘He just seems to thrive in the water and it seems to have helped him since day one. ‘I'm no doctor but I certainly believe it has helped him so much with his recovery and we go every week. ‘When he is running around he can get so breathless - but not in the pool. He can just get that exercise which has to be good for his heart and make it stronger, with the support of the water. ‘I'm not a cardiologist but it has given him a huge step in the right direction. ‘His cardiologists can't believe how well he is doing, and quite often when we take him in to appointments the nurses can't believe he actually has the condition he has.’ Charlie (pictured with his father, Dan) had to undergo open heart surgery just hours after being born and surgeons warned he might not survive. He then suffered a heart attack and had to have two more operations . Charlie's mother, Louise Bushby, takes him swimming once a week and she believes that this has helped him to build up his strength. She says his doctors are amazed by how well he has done . Ms Bushby and her partner Dan Cobb, 28, were told 20 weeks into her pregnancy that her unborn son had hypoplastic left heart syndrome - a rare congenital heart defect where the left ventricle of the heart does not develop properly. They were asked to make a life-changing decision about whether or not to continue the pregnancy. They pledged to fight on for their little boy - even though he was given just a 50 per cent chance of survival. Ms Bushby was told 20 weeks into her pregnancy that Charlie had hypoplastic left heart syndrome - a rare congenital heart defect where the left ventricle of the heart does not develop properly . He had his first open-heart surgery operation at one-day-old, and recovered remarkably well. But hours before he was due to be discharged, Charlie had a cardiac arrest in his mother's arms and was rushed to intensive care. Ms Bushby, said: ‘The doctors didn't think Charlie would wake up after the cardiac arrest and he was moved to the high dependency unit for three weeks before we were allowed to bring him home. ‘He will always have half a heart, but he is just doing so well now. He's 17 months now and he's walking, talking, running around - and of course swimming.’ Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a condition where the left side of the heart has not developed properly. The condition usually causes the left ventricle, which should pump oxygenated blood to the body, to be very small. It also often results in a blockage between the ventricle and the aorta - the artery which carries blood to the body - and in the aorta being much too small. Many babies with the condition are diagnosed before birth. The condition is very hard to treat and the heart defect cannot be corrected. Surgery is sometimes carried out to allow the right side of the heart to take over the work of the left. However, this procedure is risky and requires three operations. Occasionally, babies with the condition will be given a heart transplant. Children with the syndrome sometimes experience breathlessness and often tire easily even after treatment.","Charlie Cobb was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome .

A Noah's Ark of 18th century porcelain creatures said to be the most significant in the world has emerged - and is tipped to sell for up to £2million. The magnificent menagerie features more than 140 ornate animals and birds, many of which come in matching pairs, made by famous German porcelain pioneers Meissen. The pieces were hand-crafted in the 1730s and 1740s by Johann Kandler, who at the time was court sculptor to Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland. Regal: These £60,000 lions are part of a menagerie of porcelain animals sculpted in the 18th century . Intricate: Porcelain is notoriously hard to work with, which is why the pieces were so sought after at the time. These sparrowhawks are worth an estimated £20,000 . Highlights include a 19-inch . snuff-sniffing porcelain monkey worth £400,000 and a 17-inch pair of . guinea fowl valued at £200,000, both commissioned in 1732 for the King . of Poland's Japanese Palace in Dresden, Germany. Other pristine pairs include parrots, bitterns, lions, cats and ducks - and all items bear the famous Meissen crossed swords logo. The rare artefacts are from the private collection of British aristocrats Sir Gawaine and Lady Baillie, amassed at their West Sussex home. Sir Gawaine, a racing driver in the 1950s and 1960s, inherited the beginnings of the collection from his Anglo-American heiress mother, Lady Baillie, who had started collecting Meissen ornaments at her home at Leeds Castle in Kent in the 1930s. Experts have described the Meissen collection as the most significant to ever appear at auction and expect it to sell for up to £2million. The collection was amassed by British aristocrats Sir Gawaine and Lady Baillie at their West Sussex home. Pictured are two £60,000 bitterns (left) and a porcelain monkey (right) is expected to sell for £400,000 . Johann Kandler, the court sculptor to Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, crafted all the animals by hand, including these £200,000 guinea fowl . Alice Bleuzen, ceramics expert at . auctioneers Sotheby's, said: 'This is the most extensive collection of . Meissen animals and birds ever seen. 'Each item is of the highest quality and 95 per cent of them are 18th century originals rather than 19th century reproductions. 'Porcelain is not easy to work with but Johann Kandler was a master and this is why Meissen sculptures became famous, luxury products. 'The auction represents a wonderful opportunity for collectors. 'There is something here for everyone with items ranging from a miniature hare valued at £400 to the almost life-size monkey sculpture at £400,000. 'Never before have Meissen items of such rarity appeared at auction.' Craftsmanship: Up for auction is the biggest collection of Meissen animals ever. Pictured left are pied wagtails worth £20,000 and, right, two £40,000 parrots . Pedigree: Two cats worth £30,000. Some of the animals were commissioned in 1732 for the King of Poland's Japanese Palace in Dresden, Germany . Valuable: There are 140 ornate animals and birds in total. These wild boar could sell for £12,000 . Since the early 13th century, Europe's ruling houses had been importing porcelain at extortianate prices from China. In the early 18th century a group of mining and smelting specialists began working to discover the method of how it was produced. The first white porcelain was produced in 1708 under the direction of Johann Friedrich Böttger. Europe’s first porcelain had been born. It was the dominant style of European porcelain among royals and nobility until around 1756. The techniques used in the manufacture of pieces were cloaked in secrecy and meant to be maintained by the group, but one member betrayed the others. According to Meissen's website, the arcanist Samuel Stöltzel attempted to use his knowledge to set up a rival to the company in Vienna in 1718. This attempted faking exercise rendered a system of 'marking' necessary to prove the authenticity of any given piece. Several means of identifying porcelain were devised in the next few years, although it was not until 1920 that an underglaze cobalt blue was perfected by Meissen. This ensured a forgery-proof system of marking was found. Johann Melchior Steinbrück, first inspector at the manufactory, proposed using a motif from the Electoral Saxon coat-of-arms as the official symbol of the company, in keeping with the monogram of the then Elector Prince of Saxony and King of Poland, Augustus the Strong. Its signature logo, the crossed swords, was introduced in 1720 to protect its production; the mark of the crossed swords is one of the oldest trademarks in existence. The 'crossed swords' are still painted on by hand today.","Intricate porcelain sculptures of animals will be auctioned .

Living the high life: Speaker John Bercow's stays at top hotels have cost the taxpayer £96,000 since 2010. His wife Sally did not accompany him on the trips . John Bercow has billed the taxpayer for stays at some of the world’s most exclusive hotels, it emerged yesterday. Documents reveal that the Commons Speaker has stayed at a string of five-star establishments during official travels costing the taxpayer £96,000 since 2010. The total includes flights and other costs, but more than £10,000 went on hotels. Despite paying lip service to the need for austerity, the accommodation list for Mr Bercow, who was travelling without his wife Sally, suggests a weakness for the finer things in life – particularly when the taxpayer is picking up the bill. His stop-offs during taxpayer-funded trips have included the exclusive Park Hyatt hotel in the US capital Washington, the opulent Ashok hotel in New Delhi and the Hotel Grand Bretagne in Athens, where rooms can cost £2,000 a night. The Speaker and an aide ran up a bill of £1,062 for a two-night stay at the Park Hyatt in February last year. The hotel – where some rooms cost . £1,000 a night – boasts ‘spa-inspired limestone bathrooms’, a sky-lit . indoor swimming pool with whirlpools and a spa offering ‘facial . treatments and a private aromatherapy steam shower’. In . the same month Mr Bercow and an aide ran up a £491 bill during a . one-night stay at the Boston Harbor Hotel, listed as one of the ‘world’s . best places to stay’ by Conde Nast Traveller. Mr . Bercow also chose to relax in the luxury of Edinburgh’s Hotel Missoni . during a trip to the Scottish Parliament in June last year. The designer . hotel, where room rates this weekend started at £395, claims to be the . only five-star hotel on the Royal Mile and describes itself as ‘unique, . beautiful and daring’. The Speaker and an aide clocked up a £1,036 bill for a two-night stay at the Grand Hotel Union in Ljubljana in February 2011. The hotel describes itself as ‘the renowned address for celebrities’ visiting the Slovenian capital. Hypocrite? Mr Bercow has publicly said Parliament must do its fair share to cut the deficit but appears to enjoy the finer things in life . New Delhi’s five-star Ashok Hotel is home to one of the city’s most exclusive nightclubs where, despite India’s continuing poverty, bottles of champagne sell for £250. Details of the lavish expenses were revealed following a Freedom of Information Act request by the Daily Mail. Commons officials initially refused to publish the list of hotels on ‘security’ grounds. They argued that Mr Bercow’s safety would be put at risk if people were able to build up a ‘pattern’ of the places he stays. In fact the list, which has been released following an appeal, shows that Mr Bercow has never stayed in the same hotel twice on his official travels. The Speaker, who is paid £142,162, has said Parliament must play its part in cutting the deficit and is driving through a number of cost-cutting measures. But his own expenses are anything but modest, with his accommodation list reading like a tour of some of the world’s finest hotels. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, questioned why Mr Bercow had to stay in such lavish accommodation. He added: ‘The Speaker’s gallivanting is an expensive habit that taxpayers cannot afford and nor should they. ‘Bercow should lead by example and end his love affair with five-star accommodation. It’s hypocritical for him to dip in taxpayers’ wallets to pay for grandiose hotel bills given Westminster’s necessary drive to cut spending. ‘It’s clear that the Speaker realises . these expenses are extravagant given his determined attempt to bury the . true cost of his globe-trotting.’ Since the election in 2010 Mr Bercow . has visited almost 20 countries, as well as clocking up thousands in . expenses for travel in the UK mainly on projects to increase awareness . of the work of Parliament. The . most expensive foreign trip cost a total of £11,252, including business . class return flights to Toronto for Mr Bercow and two aides in . September 2010. It included a three-night stay at the luxury Fairmont . Chateau Hotel in Ottawa. Commons officials have defended the spending, . arguing that it is ‘an important duty of the Speaker to represent . Parliament abroad and foster good relations with fellow speakers and . parliamentarians’. A source said officials tried to achieve ‘value for money’ when booking the trips, many of which are at the invitation of foreign parliaments. But Tory MP Rob Wilson questioned why the British taxpayer should pick up the bill. ‘In such difficult economic times this looks, to the public, quite extravagant,’ he said. ‘That is not good for Parliament’s reputation, whatever the motive for the visits.’ A spokesman for Mr Bercow insisted he often had little say over where he stays. The spokesman said: ‘Overseas hotels are usually booked by the hosts and the House of Commons pays the bill – we are therefore not involved in specific arrangements. For travel within the UK, hotels are chosen for their proximity to official engagements.’","Stop offs included hotels where rooms can cost up to £2,000 a night .

Cregan wants to move to Strangeways so he can be closer to his family in Droylsden, Greater Manchester. He is currently believed to be in segregation at Full Sutton - 80 miles from Manchester - to shield him from ongoing safety threats, with reports suggesting there is an underworld reward of £20,000 for anyone who damages his remaining eye.

'If a prisoner chooses to refuse food for any reason, the Prison Service works with healthcare staff to monitor their physical and mental health. 'Prisoners who are considered mentally capable are entitled to refuse health interventions, provided they fully understand the consequences of their decision.' Fellow inmates at Full Sutton include Dennis Nilsen, who murdered 15 young men and kept their remains in his flat, and Jeremy Bamber, convicted of killing five members of his own family.

Cregan lured police officers Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, to their deaths in a gun and grenade attack on September 18 last year. He had gone on the run days before killing David Short last August after gunning down his son, Mark in Droylsden three months earlier. The manhunt reached a ghastly conclusion when Cregan ambushed the constables following a bogus 999 call to a house in Hattersley. He was given a whole life sentence at Preston Crown Court in June.","Cregan is being held in HMP Full Sutton but wants to move to Strangeways .

A Colorado man had three toes amputated after a 78-year-old veterinarian allegedly gave him medicine meant to treat cancer in dogs. A veterinarian for 54 years, Francis Freemyer is accused of illegally treating at least one human with disastrous results. The animal doctor was cited by officials for rubbing Dermex, a salve used to treat skin cancer in dogs, on the man’s foot, causing it to become infected and resulting in the man losing toes. Freemyer denies the charges and insists that he only treats animals. Dermex is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use on humans and is still in testing on animals, but Freemyer swears by the drug – he says it cured him of melanoma. Denial: Fran Freemyer denies he ever treated humans, except for himself - when he rubbed dog medicine on his own melanoma . Cops allege the folksy animal doc was ‘very energetic about his confidence in his ability to fix the foot’ and applied the ointment to a 58-year-old man’s toes when he went to the Eldred Animal Hospital in June complaining of sore toes, according to a police report. The man’s foot became severely infected, resulting in three toes being amputated at a local hospital, according to reports. Authorities told local media that Freemyer admitted to treating the unidentified man in exchange ofr payment, but he has denied these claims in several interviews with local media. ‘I don't treat people,’ Freemyer told KMGH. ‘I treat dogs and cats and cows and horses and fish and snakes and all of those things, anything that comes in the door – except people.’ Scene of the alleged crime: Cops have accused Freemyer of rubbing cancer medicine meant for dog's on a man's foot in exchange for money . Miracle drug: Freemyer swears Dermex - meant for dogs - cured his melanoma, despite its use resulting in a man losing three toes . A veterinarian at the clinic since 1959, Freemyer told CBS Denver that he rubbed Dermex on a Jack Russell terrier named ‘Scooter’ to treat lesions on its back. The woman who owns the dog then decided there was too much medicine on the dog, scraped it off and gave it to a neighbour who rubbed it on his foot and went to the animal clinic for a follow up. Ever the attentive doctor, Freemyer covered the man’s foot in plastic wrap so the dark brown dog liniment wouldn’t stain his sock. ‘He came and talked to me I said, 'hell, I don't treat people, but you've already put it on there,’ Freemyer told KUSA. A follow up visit to a regular doctor resulted in the man being admitted to a hospital and his toes being removed after his infection made its way to the bone, according to KMGH. Officials think there may be other humans Freemyer has treated. ‘This isn’t something that we run across every day and it is something that we would like to see if there’s other people out there that this person may have actually treated as well,’ a Greeley Police spokesperson told KDVR. Freemyer sees it as a witch hunt, telling KDVR ‘this is just such, it’s such a crock of, well, anyhow… the doctor’s the one that’s after me. The guy with the foot is still a good friend.’ Not his first time at the rode: Freemyer has been previously cited twice for improprieties . The unidentified man refuses to cooperate with police, according to reports. One local called the allegations ‘crazy.’ ‘When I heard it I couldn’t believe it because I’ve know the man all my life and he doesn’t do that. He doesn’t do it because he knows his job,’ Ruth Allmer emphatically told KDVR. Even crazier, Freemyer told KUSA that he cured himself of malignant melanoma by rubbing Dermex on his skin. This is not the first time the animal doc has run afoul of regulators, he has been previously cited twice for indiscretions, according to Reuters. The first citation was the result of Freemyer certifying he examined 13 greyhounds after only seeing 12, it resulted in a $1,500 fine. The second violation came when Freemyer was found to have not properly kept a cat’s medical records, he was fined $250. The veteran vet plans to fight the latest charges in court.","Francis Freemyer has been a veterinarian since 1959 .

Sweet victory: The England team go berserk last night after winning the Ashes 3-0 following the final test at the Oval . The story has come from the Australian media, who could be accused of sour grapes after their team lost 3-0 after a five-match series this summer. The Herald Sun in Melbourne called it a 'distasteful incident' that was carried out in full view of the press box - but after the 23,500 fans had gone. Malcolm Conn wrote in the Herald Sun: 'While the centre of the ground was quite dark, lights were on in the grandstands with dozens of people still cleaning up after a late finish which saw the game go beyond 7.30pm. 'A number of players including Stuart Broad, Kevin Pietersen and Jimmy Anderson took it in turns urinating on the pitch to the cheers of their team mates.

Nearly one in four people blame their aches and pains on their working environment where they remain in the same position for long periods of time, a new study has revealed. More than one in six Britons also blame joint pain and back ache on the chair they sit in at work, according to new research. However, more than a third of Britons who suffer aches and pains believe they are just an inevitable part of ageing. Nearly one in four people blame their aches and pains on their working environment where they remain in the same position for long periods of time - and one in six think their chair is to blame . The study suggests that people’s aches and pains also cause them trouble outside of work - one in seven Britons say they are less interested in romantic relationships as a result of their pain. The survey of 1,000 people, aged 25 to 65, with aches and pains was commissioned by the Simplyhealth Advisory Research Panel. It found that aches and pains associated with the body’s skeleton and muscles are a fact of life for thousands of people in the UK, with back pain affecting four out of five people at some time in their lives. Aches and pains are estimated to cost the UK £5.7 billion a year and result in 10 million lost working days. Perhaps worryingly, three in four sufferers do not seek professional help, believing they need a referral from their doctor to see a physiotherapist. The study identifies that lower back pain is the nation’s number one sore spot with seven in 10 complaining of problems in this area. More than a third of Britons who suffer aches and pains believe they are just an inevitable part of ageing . It also reveals that those who weigh more than 14 stone are more likely to suffer pain on a daily basis. Nearly a quarter of back and joint pain sufferers cannot lift heavy items, one in five cannot walk for long periods and nine per cent say pain had such a big impact on their lives that they are unable to play with their children or climb stairs. The study found that women are more likely to suffer joint pain than men. One in three women have painful knees compared with one in five men, while 40 per cent of women say their joint problems make them feel old before their time and 28 per cent are depressed and frustrated. This was compared to 25 per cent of men who say pain makes them feel older and 23 who say it makes them depressed. Painkillers are the most commonly used treatment for back pain, despite dangers of long-term use, including heart attack, stroke and high blood pressure. Arthritis is the most common cause of musculoskeletal problems in the UK, with more than 10 million people per year consulting a doctor about it. Experts say the problem is rising because of the growing issue of obesity in the UK. Dr Gill Jenkins, a GP on the Simplyhealth Advisory Research Panel, said: ‘Over the counter painkillers can be useful, particularly for acute episodes, but it is not wise to take them for long periods without consulting your GP, particularly if you have other problems. ‘It is important that people with persistent aches and pains discuss their options with their doctor, physiotherapist or other health professional.’ Raman Sankaran, a spokesperson for healthcare provider Simplyhealth, said: ‘While people visit the dentist when they have a toothache or see an optician if their eyesight worsens, 89 per cent of those with pain in their lower back and joints appear reluctant to consult a physiotherapist.’","One in six Britons blame their joint pain on the chair they sit in at work .

A burglar who was held up by politicians as a major success story for the justice system has returned to jail after resuming his life of crime. Brandon Chomyn had vowed to turn his life around, working hard to gain qualifications while on probation, and earned a meeting with the Home Secretary in January this year. But although he sent off applications for more than 50 jobs, not a single employer offered him an interview or even acknowledged his receiving his CV. He went back to earning a living 'the only way he knows how', a court heard, and burgled a house in June. Chomyn, 34, was jailed for three months at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court yesterday after admitting to the crime, in which he stole £170 cash. Judge David Pugsley told him: 'In prison you learnt things that would help you find a job, but when you came out you didn't even get a reply to your applications. 'That is something lots of people with unblemished characters have to deal with, and don't think I'm unsympathetic to that. 'It is tough, especially in this area. But burgling other people's houses isn't the answer.' Stoke-on-Trent has some of highest levels of unemployment in the country, with nearly 3,000 people currently out of work. Theresa May visited the city earlier this year to learn about the local police's Integrated Offender Management programme, which targets prolific offenders, and met Chomyn during her trip. Meeting: Chomyn was hailed as a success story by Home Secretary Theresa May . Robert Smith, defending, told the court: 'Mr Chomyn's explanation is that since coming out of custody where he had completed courses such as NVQs, he applied for 50 jobs. 'In doing so he was frank about his history, and never got an interview, or an acknowledgement. But he continued to do well, that is the picture painted by the probation officer. 'He did so well he was invited to a meeting with the Home Secretary. He was presented as a model of compliance.' However, following his release, . Chomyn was put in accommodation by crime reduction charity Nacro, which . put him back in touch with other offenders. Mr Smith added: 'He was living with people who had committed the same sort of offences, people he had learnt to move away from. 'He . was desperate. He couldn't obtain work. His girlfriend's benefits had . been stopped. So they were both living on £70 a fortnight. This is why . these offences were committed. 'He decided to make a living the only way he knew how.' Chomyn . asked for another two break-ins to be taken into account, taking his . total number of convictions for burglary up to eight.","Brandon Chomyn, 34, tried to reform himself after being released from jail .

Cigarettes could be banned from being sold in packets of 10 in an EU bid to prevent children from starting to smoke. The planned curbs, which would also hit menthol and 'slim' cigarettes, could outlaw the sale of more than half of all tobacco currently sold in Britain. Tobacco giants have lashed out against the proposed legislation, claiming that it will deprive the Treasury of revenue as smokers turn to the black market. Curbs: 10-packs and menthol cigarettes could be outlawed by new legislation being considered by the EU . The latest development in the EU's long-running battle against smoking is set to come in a European Parliament vote on September 10. MEPs will vote on whether to outlaw the sales of 10-packs, flavoured and slim cigarettes, as well as smaller packets of loose-leaf tobacco. If they approve the new rules, they could come into effect as early as 2016. Currently 38 per cent of all cigarettes are sold in packs of 10, but there are concerns that the cheaper packets make it more likely that young people will start smoking. Crackdown: The Government has jettisoned plans to introduce plain packaging with graphic photographs . Mothers and grandmothers are concerned that bright, colourful packaging makes tobacco appealing to children, according to a new poll. The survey by Cancer Research UK found that four out of five women believe bright packaging is attractive to young people, with 85 per cent saying that children should not be exposed to tobacco marketing. Campaigners are using the results to push the Government to introduce plain packaging for all cigarettes, a plan which was put on hold last month. Under the plans, tobacco packs would all be the same colour and would carry a prominent, graphic warning about the dangers of smoking. Today's survey of mothers and grandmothers of children under 18 found 92 per cent would be worried about their children if they became addicted to smoking. Over 200,000 children take up smoking every year, with more girls smoking regularly than boys, figures show. Alison Cox, Cancer Research UK's head of tobacco control, said: 'We're urging the Government to introduce plain, standardised packaging of tobacco, which, as well as being a popular move, would show that the Government cares more about the health of future generations than the profits of the tobacco industry. 'We'd like to see the Government protect children from the lure of sophisticated tobacco industry marketing and introduce plain, standardised packaging as a way to reduce the number of young people who take up smoking.' Labour has accused the Coalition of 'caving in to big business' by delaying the introduction of plain packaging, but health minister Anna Soubry said she 'would never give in to pressure'. Menthol and slim cigarettes are also thought to be more attractive to young people by disguising the taste of smoking. Another proposal would mean that loose tobacco for roll-up cigarettes and pipes could only be sold in packs of 40g or more. Currently, more than 90 per cent of loose tobacco comes in packs of 25g or 12.5g. The EU is anxious to reduce the number of deaths caused by smoking, which currently stands at 700,000 per year across the continent. However, large tobacco companies have warned that the legislation could have unintended consequences, costing the Treasury as much as £800million in lost revenue. Japan Tobacco International, maker of Silk Cut and Benson & Hedges, suggested that the UK was 'sleepwalking' towards an unacceptably harsh crackdown. Paul Williams, the firm's head of corporate affairs, said that the legislation was 'even more severe' than plans to impose plain packaging which were delayed last month. Ukip leader Nigel Farage, one of Britain's most high-profile smokers, told the Daily Express: 'This is part of a wrong-headed drive that will penalise the legal pleasures of the least well-off. 'The net result will be an increase in sub-standard counterfeit and smuggled tobacco, which will have obvious negative health outcomes. Let alone a deliberate reduction in personal freedom - that is a matter of course from Brussels.' Ronan Barry of British American Tobacco added: 'There's an enormous risk. 'Just take menthol - if almost a million smokers wake up one morning and they can no longer buy their preferred product in the shop, there's a massive opportunity there created for criminals and illegal traders to step in and meet the demand that the legal market can no longer supply.'","European Parliament to curb smaller packs as well as flavoured cigarettes .

The number of people renting homes has soared by a staggering 89 per cent in 10 years as householders struggle to get on the housing ladder, new data has revealed. Figures show a dramatic rise in the number of tenants in England and Wales, from 1.9million households in 2001 to 3.6million in 2011. The rise has lead to a surge in the number of 'rental hotspots' emerging across the country. In 2001 there were just eight 'hotspot' areas in England and Wales that had between 20 and 40 per cent of homes . rented out, but by 2011 this had climbed to 51 areas. Rental surge: The flooding of colour across the 2011 map shows how widespread this new market has become, with large numbers of people renting in London, Kent, Nottingham and Leicester . Changing times: The rental picture looked dramatically different in 2001 with large swatches of people in Wales, Devon and Cornwall and parts of the North renting properties ten years ago . Experts say the phenomenon - dubbed 'Generation Rent' - is down to the battle . many face to raise enough money for a house deposit, and the older . generation being forced to release capital from their own homes to pay . for their care in later life. Traditionally, . London has always been the area where large numbers of people choose to . rent, due to the spiraling cost of buying. However the new data shows that in the past decade this has expanded to include large pockets of the South, East and North.  Now only a few small areas of the country have little or no properties lived in by tenants. Seaside town: Bournemouth (pictured) is the top rental hotspot outside of London. More people are renting for longer as they struggle to raise a deposit meaning the rental market has changed dramatically in just 10 years . Hotspot: Many . of the renting hotspots tend to be university cities or major business hubs, . but more unusual hotspots include Torbay, (pictured) Eastbourne and Hastings where landlords are cashing in . Many . of the hotspots tend to be university cities or major business hubs, . but more unusual hotspots include Torquay in Torbay, Eastbourne and Hastings.

Hastings . 4. Manchester . 5. Oxford . 6. Reading . 7. Blackpool . 8. Cambridge . 9. Southampton . 10. Slough . The South East is also popular with many seaside towns seeing rising numbers of rental properties. Ten years ago, the picture was radically different and rental hotspots were centred on large parts of Devon and Cornwall, London and the west of Wales. Housing . experts believe that although home-ownership will remain constant, more . people will have to rent for longer as it becomes increasingly . difficult to raise a deposit. Stephanie McMahon, Head of Research for Strutt & Parker said: 'The . private rental sector has changed dramatically over the past decade, . and although this brings us more in line with our northern European . peers we are still some way off the scale of the rental sector in . countries like Germany and Switzerland. 'In . our view it is likely that overall home ownership will remain between . 60 and 70 per cent over people’s lifetimes, but we will see much more . openness to rental at different life stages and for longer time . periods.' She added: 'It is widely acknowledged that long-term . rental is increasingly common, driven by factors such as whether the . younger generation are able to raise deposits to buy, or indeed the . older generation releasing capital from their homes for care and . pensions. Capital bubble: There are a significant number of London boroughs where the rental increase has been dramatic with Barking and Dagenham seeing an increase of 230 per cent in 10 years . 'The varied growth of this market across the UK clearly points . to a need to understand local markets rather than just the big picture.' Within London, a number of boroughs have seen an increase in the number of rented properties, such as Barking and Dagenham, which has seen an increase of 230 per cent in 10 years, and Tower Hamlets, which has seen a rise of more than 150 per cent. Traditionally established areas in prime central London such as Hammersmith and Fulham as well as Kensington and . Chelsea have also seen increases of between 30 and 60 per cent. Ms McMahon said: 'It is widely acknowledged that long-term renting is now immensely common for the younger generation and even more affluent older generations are exploring this different lifestyle option and seeing how much more they can get for their money in rental rather than committing to buying.'","Numbers rose from 1.9million tenant households in 2001 to 3.6million in 2011 .

Jack Newton, 23, sprinted to the wreckage to find businessman David, 56, and university student Rebecca, 21, had been horrifically maimed in the light aircraft crash. After begging local farmers for help, paramedics were called to the site in Wymeswold, Leicestershire, but the father and daughter were pronounced dead at the scene. Horror: Jack Newton, 23, left, watched in horror as the plane carrying father David, 56, and university student sister Rebecca, 21, right, crashed on a landing strip in Wymeswold, Leicestershire . As emotional tributes were paid to Mr and Miss Newton, investigators are now trying to work out what caused the tragic accident. Mr Newton, an experienced pilot nicknamed ‘Dangerous Dave’, is understood to have lost control of the two-seater plane just 300 yards away from the runway. It is thought that moments after taking off at just before 8pm on Wednesday evening, the Europa XS aircraft, which Mr Newton had owned since 2009, suddenly came down, crashing into farmland with such force that the nose and tail of the plane broke off on impact. Eye-witnesses said Jack, who had been . watching his family fly from nearby, ran over to the wreckage before seeking help from farmers. Billy . Dunne, 53, whose Common Farm home overlooks the crash site about 200 . yards away, said: ‘A young lad came running across the field. [At first] . he couldn’t speak. He said a plane had crashed and was shouting about . getting the ambulance and the police. ‘I . ran across to try and help, but when I got there I saw there was . nothing anyone could do, it was too late. He wanted to get his sister . out, but I had to pull him back. Tragedy: David Newton, 56, left, and his 23-year-old daughter Rebecca, right, were killed when the light aircraft they were flying in smashed into farmland in Wymeswold, at around 7.55pm on Wednesday . ‘The . young lad was in a state of shock. He said it was his dad and his . sister. I took his keys off him so he couldn’t drive and kept his car . here for him. I think the police took him home.’ The farmer said no one could have survived the crash. ‘I was quite shocked when I went over . to it. You couldn’t tell it was an aircraft, the cockpit had gone and . the back of the plane had broken off. It was totally smashed, shattered . to pieces. It was a mess,’ he added. Mr Newton, who flew three times a week, was a director of a company specialising in air conditioning instillations. He . lived with his children in a £250,000 house the village of Cropwell . Bishop, Nottinghamshire, after becoming estranged from their mother, . Sylvia. Keen pilot: David Newton was a keen pilot who is pictured here in his light aircraft at an air show in Wickenby, Lincoln, in 2011 . The businessman was a regular visitor to air shows and he was pictured landing his Europa XS in Wickenby, Lincoln, in 2011. Paul Wheaton, who worked with him, wrote online: ‘Raising a glass in town to a good friend and work colleague who died unexpectedly on Wednesday. ‘I will miss the chats, your sense of humour and the pints in the Grinder. ‘Rest in peace and God Bless you Dangerous Dave.’ Rebecca, who was due to start her final year at Brunel University, lived in Southampton but had been visiting her family during the summer holiday. The keen skier, who had worked as a volunteer for St John’s Ambulance for three years, is believed to have been in the passenger seat when the plane crashed. Mr Newton’s son Jack is believed to have been in the Armed Forces since 2009, serving in Afghanistan until two years ago as a Guardsman in the Grenadier Guards’ 1st Battalion Inkerman Company. A spokesman for Leicestershire Police said: ‘The two people who died in the light aircraft crash in Wymeswold earlier this week were father and daughter. ‘Formal identification of the deceased has not yet taken place and may not be done for some time. ‘Officers are working in conjunction with the Air Accident Investigations Branch to investigate the cause of the crash. It is believed the flight was taking off from the Wymeswold area.’","Experienced pilot David Newton, 56, 'lost control' of plane just yards from runway in Wymeswold, Leicestershire .

He is said to move in mysterious ways and, at last, there may be an explanation why. For, according to pensions minister Steve Webb, God is a Liberal Democrat. Although the party has been languishing in single figures in the polls, he argues that, in the long term, it has the support of the Almighty. Writing in a new book about the party’s relationship with Christianity, Mr Webb says it is clear from the Bible that God shares the Lib Dems’ core beliefs. ‘The most fundamental reason why Christians should feel at home in the Liberal Democrats is that the character of God, as revealed in the Christian Gospel, would suggest that God must be a liberal,’ he writes. ‘This assertion will shock or offend some but I believe there is no other conclusion that can be drawn from the New Testament.’ He goes on: ‘Those who recognise in the Gospel a deep reverence for human freedom and self-determination will find a natural home in the Liberal Democrats.’ His comments come in a new book of essays, Liberal Democrats Do God. The title is a riposte to former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell who famously banned questions about Tony Blair’s religious faith by telling reporters: ‘We don’t do God’. Despite Mr Webb’s eye-catching claims the book is unlikely to feature on Nick Clegg’s reading list, since the Lib Dem leader has declared himself an atheist. But party president Tim Farron appears to back Mr Webb, citing a call to Christian’s by Peter to ‘engage with politics’. Writing in the new book, Mr Farron says: Liberal Democrats stand alone as the defender of the rights of all human beings’. But writing in the same book the Catholic MP Greg Mulholland warns that the Lib Dems have become ‘anti-religious’ and ‘illiberal’ in their rejection of Christianity. Halo default: Despite the God Almighty supposedly being on his side, Nick Clegg's party keeps sliding in the polls . ‘I fear that what we are heading towards now in the party is away from freedom of conscience and towards a new moral conformity,’ he writes. Mr Webb is also taken to task by a prominent Lib Dem councillor who pointed out that ‘virtually every political tradition under the sun has at some time claimed the Almighty as their own.’ Lester Holloway, a councillor in Sutton and former editor of the Black newspaper New Nation, said: ‘History is littered with assorted dodgy Christian tribes hanging their noxious beliefs on particular Bible passages. Indeed slavery and forced conversion was justified on such grounds. ‘Webb’s interpretation is, of course, grounded on a wider reading of the Bible yet so too is a Conservative take on the Bible.’ Mr Holloway went on: ‘The party is led by a man who has declared he doesn’t believe in God yet his belief in the Tories seems to be stronger. I don’t suppose God believes in suicide yet several disabled people have done just that after (eligibility) tests imposed by the department of which Webb is a minister of state.’","Pensions Minister Steve Webb claims God is Liberal Democrat .

"By . Sean Poulter . PUBLISHED: . 12:10 EST, 25 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:25 EST, 25 August 2013 . Reduced alcohol wine has been presented by the government as the answer to the crisis of drink-related illness and even drunkenness among the middle classes. Now, the major wine labels are introducing brands that typically come in at an alcohol content of 5.5per cent, which is less than half the normal figure. Australian brands like Banrock Station and Blossom Hill are marketing the new low alcohol wines on the basis that customers can safely have a relaxing glass and still drive home. Reduced alcohol: Traditional producers are sceptical about Australian brands Blossom Hill, left, and Banrock Station, right, creating new low alcohol wines . Best of both worlds: Manufacturers of the low alcohol wine hope that drinkers will still be able to enjoy wine without the negative side effects . However, they are running up against a tide of opposition from both British wine experts and traditional producers in France and other parts of Europe. For a drink that wants to be called wine is – under EU law – required to have a minimum alcohol content of at least 8.5per cent. Trend: Miranda's Summer Light Shiraz will go on sale in Tesco in November for £4.99 . British health minister, Earl Howe, is lobbying in Brussels to win a change in the definition, for there is a fear that these new low alcohol drinks will not succeed unless they are called wines. The low alcohol wines are made in exactly the same way as traditional vintages, which come in at between 11per cent and 15per cent alcohol. The change comes at the end of the process, when the alcohol is removed using a spinning centrifuge system or filtered out via a process called reverse osmosis. However, renowned wine expert, Charles . Metcalfe, said: ‘The problem with removing the alcohol is that it takes . some of the flavour with it. 'You are left with something that really . just does not taste like wine.’ The . Blossom Hill Vie and the Banrock Station Light White are both 5.5per . cent alcohol and sell for £4.99 a bottle in leading supermarkets. A . 2013 Miranda Summer Light, which is made with Shiraz grapes, and a 2013 . Miranda Summer Light, made with Sauvignon Blanc grapes, will go on sale . in Tesco in November for £4.99. Both are 5.5per cent. Earl Howe claims that the market for low or reduced alcohol ‘wines’ has been increasingly rapidly. He . insists that promoting low alcohol wines was in customers’ ‘best long . term interests’, amid concerns over a rise in liver diseases and cancers . linked to alcohol consumption. ‘The . government has consistently made the case for change to the EU wine . rules to permit reduced and de-alcoholised products to be called wines,’ he said. However, Mr . Metcalfe said: ‘This is the British government against the whole of wine . making Europe and there is no real chance of success.’ He . said there are some traditional wines that are relatively in low . alcohol, for example some German types made with Reisling grapes and the . moscato wines from the north of Italy. Mr Metcalfe said: ‘Of course it is a good idea for people to drink less alcohol. ‘There is a huge amount of . alcohol-related disease, the road accidents, plus the aggressiveness and . violence, but, personally, I don’t believe that going for reduced . alcohol wine is the best way to achieve a reduction in consumption. ‘Leave . wine alone. Drink naturally lower alcohol wine if you want to, . otherwise don’t drink wine, beer and spirits, stick to water and fruit . juice. ‘Don’t mess around with wine.’ Drinks industry expert at retail analysts, Mintel, Chris Wisson, said he sees a big future for these reduced alcohol wines. ‘I call them 'sessionable' wine. That means you can drink a lot in one session,’ he said. ‘We're not expecting them to be for connoisseurs. They're absolutely fine, but they won't blow your socks off.’","Australian brands are releasing new low alcohol wines at 5.5% ABV .

"By . Krishna Kumar . PUBLISHED: . 18:20 EST, 26 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:25 EST, 26 August 2013 . In the wake of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar's murder in Pune and a photojournalist's gang-rape in Mumbai, a regional language news channel in Maharashtra carried the pictures of chief minister Prithiviraj Chavan, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and home minister R R Patil with the caption 'Murda' (dead). It was a strong statement but one that aptly summed up the general sentiment against the government - in fact, the entire political class - across the state. The political leadership seems simply incapable of doing anything to stem the rot that the state had slipped into. Law and order - its absence, to be precise - has particularly been an area of concern. The amount of pressure on the government can be gauged by the fact that home minister R R Patil himself went to the NM Joshi Marg police station, where the gang-rape case was registered, and was present during the interrogation of the accused. Chief minister Prithviraj Chavan, along with other cabinet members, went to pay his last respects to Dabholkar and also visited the Mumbai gang-rape victim in the hospital. Nervous . That has, however, not assuaged the public anger and the Congress-NCP coalition government has been facing the Opposition heat. BJP leader Devendra Phadnavis said the two recent incidents of crime ""shows that there is no law and order in the state"". The Shiv Sena, which at one time used to laud R R Patil, also slammed him and called for his resignation. While Patil's detractors in the NCP are happy, the top leadership is worried that his sliding performance - as that of other ministers from the party - could hurt the NCP's prospects in the next Lok Sabha and Assembly elections. This nervousness is betrayed by the fact that the NCP, which until two years ago was flexing its muscles and planning to go it alone in the next elections, seems to have changed its mind. It has decided to contest in alliance with the Congress and on the basis of the old seat-sharing formula. Political analyst and associate professor in the University of Mumbai, Aruna Pendse, said the fact that the NCP has decided not to demand more seats from the Congress shows the party is on the back foot. ""The two big faces of the NCP in the state are R R Patil and Ajit Pawar and they have been facing flak for a number of issues - Patil for the law and order issue and Pawar for his alleged involvement in the irrigation scam and his insensitive comments in the aftermath of drought. ""Thanks to these leaders, the NCP's image has taken a beating and that could hurt its prospects in the polls,"" Pendse said. Poll prospects . According to Pendse, the irrigation scam and the poor law and order situation will not damage the Congress as much as its alliance partner. ""The people know that Patil and Pawar are the faces of the NCP and that they are responsible for the mess in their departments. Also, if the Congress rolls out the Food Security Bill even by December, it could create a favourable impact among the voters,"" said Pendse. Also, CM Chavan has maintained a clean image in spite of all the controversies. Not all, however, agree. The anti-incumbency factor, price rise and the lack of development are some of the strong factors that go against the Congress. The only solace for the ruling parties . is that the Opposition seems to be in the shambles and has not been able . to capitalise on the government's failures. Pendse also feels that despite the hammering that its image has taken, the NCP may not face a poll rout simply because its elected representatives control Western Maharashtra's economy through the sugar cooperatives. ""For the NCP, the emphasis would be on retaining its current eight seats and then try to get more,"" she said. If the prognosis for the ruling parties is grim, the Opposition's prospects are not bright either. The BJP is grappling with infighting and the lack of an inspiring leader. Its two biggest leaders in the state, Gopinath Munde and Nitin Gadkari, are staunch rivals. Crime scene: The Shakti Mills compound in Mumbai where a photojournalist was gang-raped. The Prithviraj Chavan government has been facing the heat over rising incidents of crime in the state . The situation of its ally, the Shiv Sena, is even worse. Since Bal Thackeray's death, the Senais fast becoming a spent force. Uddhav Thackeray lacks the charisma of his father. Its ties with the BJP have also been strained of late as it's openly aired its unease with Narendra Modi. With elections approaching, all eyes will be on Raj Thackeray-led MNS, which is being courted by both the BJP and the Congress. While the people are angry over the failure of political leadership, the political parties are only worried about the impact of some recent developments on their electoral fortunes. Chief minister Prithviraj Chavan maybe at the receiving end of all the criticism, but it would be unfair to blame him solely for all that transpires in the state. The Congress and its ally NCP are both in power in the state with almost equal number of seats shared between them. The portfolios are divided between the two in such a manner that the Congress doesn't interfere in the departments held by the NCP and vice versa. Take for example the CCTV promise. Chavan has not been able to pull up state home minister R R Patil, whose department is supposed to handle the CCTV installation programme, because Patil belongs to the NCP. Even in the case of bad roads in the state, the chief minister has not been able to assert much as the Public Works Department (PWD) and the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) are headed by NCP ministers. When the chief minister did try to intervene in the irrigation scam, it shook the stability of the government. Last year, Chavan had questioned how the irrigation department had spent close to Rs 70,000 crore on irrigation projects but had not been able to bring even one per cent of land under cultivation. This led to a war of words between the chief minister and his deputy Ajit Pawar of the NCP. Pawar had held the irrigation portfolio till a few years ago. The feud between them went to such an extent that Ajit resigned as the deputy chief minister in September last year, prompting a spate of resignations from his supporters. While the crisis was averted and Ajit was brought back as deputy chief minister a few days later, the issue clearly showed how the two ruling parties were actually behaving in a state of opposition and hurling charges against each other. Chavan has also been constrained in his task of providing good governance from elements within his own party. Since Chavan took over as the chief minister, there have been at least three attempts to unseat him. One of attempts was led by State Congress president Manikrao Thakre. Chavan despite hailing from the state does not have a support base of MLAs. This means that almost all factions in the Congress are gunning for him. Many of his party's ministers do not listen to him.","NCP-Congress coalition feels the pressure mount over high-profile crimes .

Plans: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles will announce that councils should ban speed bumps in town centres . Councils should ban speed bumps in town centres and provide more parking spaces for shoppers, Eric Pickles will announce today as he targets ‘anti-car’ measures. The Communities Secretary will tell local authorities their parking rules must aim to rejuvenate high streets, rather than raising revenue from ‘penalising’ drivers. New guidance will state that ‘draconian’ measures against cars, including ‘over-zealous’ traffic wardens, and ‘street clutter’ such as bollards and road humps which prevent parking, are stifling the local economy. Half of parking services are run by councils and Mr Pickles said attempts to put off drivers have pushed shoppers away from high streets and into out-of-town shops. He cited recent research from the Association of Town and City Management which has shown a strong relationship between parking provision and high street footfall. Mr Pickles said simpler rules – to replace 7,000 pages of previous planning documents – would be issued to councils this week with guidance on the design of parking arrangements to boost walking and cycling but without penalising car users. He said: ‘Draconian town hall parking policies and street clutter can make driving into town centres unnecessarily stressful and actually create more congestion because of lack of places to park. ‘Anti-car measures are driving motorists into the arms of internet retailers and out-of-town superstores. ‘Trying to find somewhere to park is an obstacle course in too many of our towns, cities and seaside resorts. 'Confusing and difficult car parking practices are undermining the economic vitality of the high street and tourist destinations. Changes: Mr Pickles said simpler rules - to replace 7,000 pages of previous planning documents - would be issued to councils this week with guidance on the design of parking arrangements . ‘Over-zealous parking wardens have inflicted real damage on local economies and given many towns and councils a bad name. Town halls need to ditch their anti-car dogma.’ Figures out this month from the RAC showed the 359 English councils raked in a £565million surplus from parking charges in 2011-12 – £50million more than the previous year. This is what they earned from on-street parking, off-street parking and penalties, minus running costs. 'Town halls need to ditch their anti-car dogma' Communities Secretary Eric Pickles . Westminster council in London had the highest individual parking surplus at nearly £42million. A Local Government Association spokesman said parking charges were falling in real terms, while councils were investing the money in filling potholes and improving roads. He added: ‘Councils work hard to try to boost trade and keep high streets vibrant through parking incentives. ‘Creating more spaces in town and city centres where there is no room for them is simply not the way to draw more shoppers to the high street.’","Eric Pickles will say parking rules must aim to rejuvenate high streets .

George Zimmerman's lawyer has chided him for visiting a firearms factory that makes the type of gun he used to kill unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin last year. Zimmerman, who was acquitted of murder in July, was this week pictured at the Kel-Tec plant in Cocoa, Florida, grinning and shaking hands with an employee. 'We understand how George visiting the factory that produces the gun used to shoot Trayvon Martin is seen as inappropriate,' Shawn Vincent, spokesman for Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O'Mara, told Reuters on Friday. Scroll down for video . Shopping around: This is the first public image of George Zimmerman to emerge since his acquittal on murder charges. He poses here with an employee at the Kel Tec gun factory . Zimmerman and his lawyer stopped at the gun maker's headquarters to check out the high-capacity Kel-Tec KSG pump-action shotgun. TMZ.com reports that Zimmerman was interested in buying the weapon, though it is unclear whether he actually left with one. Kel-Tec is the same company that made the . PF-9 9mm pistol he used to shoot 17-year-old Trayvon last year. Zimmerman contended he killed the teen in self-defense after he . sustained a beating. TMZ . reports that the son of Kel-Tec's owner personally gave Zimmerman a tour . of the company in Coca, Florida, including a view of the manufacturing . plant and showroom. Making a statement: The Kel-Tec KSG holds up to 15 shotshells - nearly twice the capacity of traditional tractical-style shotguns . In the market for a new gun: George Zimmerman was seen shopping for a high-tech shotgun at the headquarters of Kel-Tec arms . Zimmerman and his lawyer, Mark O'Mara, were looking into the legality of buying a Kel-Tec KSG, a cutting edge weapon that has two magazines to hold shotgun shells, according to reports. He posed for at least one photograph with a worker at the plant. It is unknown whether he actually bought the weapon. The KSG can fire up to 15 12-gauge shotgun shells without re-loading, nearly twice the capacity of other tactical-style shotguns, which are usually converted hunting arms.The gun costs about $1,200. Shotguns like the KSG are primarily used for home defense. Shotshells fire multiple pellets at once that are meant to spread out. Zimmerman's 9mm pistol, also made by Kel Tec, was returned to him after he was acquitted of all charges in the death of Trayvon Martin . They can be devastating at close range - and much more effective than the 9mm bullet fired by his handgun. Shotshells lose most of their effectiveness at ranges over 25 to 35 yards. Whereas Zimmerman's Kel-Tec pistol is small and concealable, the shotgun he examined is meant to make a statement. It emits an audible sound - familiar to any hunter or fan of zombie movies - whenever the action is cycled. Zimmerman, 29, has been a free man since he was acquitted of all charges July 13 in the shooting of unarmed Trayvon. The racially-charged case brought thousands of death threats to Zimmerman and his family. A fringe black panther group reportedly put a price on his head, as well. After his acquittal, police returned the pistol that killed Trayvon to Zimmerman. He was carrying it in his truck when he was pulled over in Texas less than two weeks later. The former neighborhood watch volunteer from Sanford, Florida, was forced to flee his home and has been in hiding ever since the case began receiving international attention.

Marksmen will begin culling thousands of badgers today amid a huge police operation to prevent disruption from protesters who plan to overrun killing sites. Officers are braced for violent clashes between farmers and animal rights campaigners who will launch patrols this morning. Activists even plan to abuse health and safety rules by storming into cull sites, forcing shooters to hold their fire. TB prevention: Marksmen will begin culling thousands of badgers today amid a huge police operation to prevent disruption from protesters . Jay Tiernan of campaign group Stop the Cull said: ‘We will not have to stand between the guns and the badgers. Health and safety rules mean they will not shoot when people are nearby.’ Police today said a cull protester had been arrested after allegedly trying to break in to a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs site. A police helicopter and three police cars were called after the protester, thought to be Mr Tiernan, tried to enter the site in Gloucestershire. The cull is an attempt to tackle bovine tuberculosis, which is transmitted by badgers and has led to the death of 305,000 cattle in the UK over the past decade.

Over the course of a trial that begins today, as many as 5,000 badgers will be killed across 58 square miles of Gloucestershire and Somerset. The scheme will continue every year for the next four years, and is predicted to cut bovine TB by 16 per cent. Last week the National Farming Union was granted an injunction in the High Court barring anti-cull activists from approaching farmers’ homes and business premises and cull sites.

Furious: Angela Godwin, 34, with her daughter who was illegally tattooed aged 14 by a man using a kit he bought online . An unlicensed tattooist who illegally branded a 14-year-old girl has been let off with only a £40 fine. Ross Richardson used a kit he had bought online to mark the stomach of the teenager, who was four years below the legal minimum age of 18. The schoolgirl paid him £20 for the tattoo – designed to commemorate her late grandfather – which was done at his flat on a ‘dirty mattress on the floor’. Richardson, 23, was later fined £40 after he pleaded guilty to tattooing a minor. Yesterday the girl’s mother Angela Godwin, 34, said: ‘I think it is disgusting he has got away with just a £40 fine. ‘It’s pathetic. My daughter was vulnerable and she was put in a compromising position by this man.’ The mother-of-three, who works as a midwife, said: ‘I’m so angry and so upset with what has happened and the tiny amount of punishment he received. ‘It was an unforgivable act of selfish greed. I despise him.’ Miss Godwin, who did not want to reveal her daughter’s name, said the teenager – now 15 – had been ‘scared to death’ after realising she could have become ill from unsterilised tattoo equipment. Speaking at their family home in Gloucester, she said: ‘She had blood tests and they are clear but it has petrified her. ‘She hates it and regrets it entirely. She is desperate to have it removed and is really upset she has this horrible mark on her.’ Angry: Miss Godwin, left, was horrified when she saw the design on her daughter. Ross Richardson, right, was fined just £40 for the offence at Stroud Magistrates' Court on Monday . She added: ‘She can’t have it removed until she is 18 and even then it could cost £2,000 so I see this as her punishment.’ The design shows a set of rosary beads with the letter J underneath, for her grandfather John who died in March. Miss Godwin first spotted the tattoo, inked in June, while her daughter was playing with her younger sister, and demanded an explanation before calling the police. She said: ‘He never asked her age [or] gave her any information on safety and just did not seem  to care. ‘He asked her who knows about it and she lied and said her dad, to which he apparently replied “That’s good enough for me”. 'At the age of 14 I do not see how it can be her fault. She didn’t have the capacity to make her own decisions. He had a responsibility to say no to her.' Richardson was fined £40 and ordered to pay a £20 victim surcharge as well as £20 costs at Stroud Magistrates’ Court in Gloucestershire on Monday. Prosecuting, Teresa Perry said: 'No questions were asked of age or consent. Her mother was aghast.' She said he admitted not asking the girl’s age but assumed she was 18. Richardson refused to comment at his Gloucester flat yesterday.","Schoolgirl paid Ross Richardson, from Gloucester, £20 for tattoo .

"By . Jack Doyle . PUBLISHED: . 18:20 EST, 26 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:07 EST, 27 August 2013 . Britain’s regime for controlling dangerous paedophiles is fundamentally flawed, a damning police review has concluded. It leaves thousands of serious sex offenders free to leave the country to abuse youngsters overseas. There are some 65,000 registered sex offenders in the UK, but only 50 orders stopping such individuals travelling abroad have been obtained in the past five and a half years. Free to attack again: Paedophiles such as pop star Gary Glitter are largely free to travel abroad where they can attack again . Yet every year the Foreign Office is notified of dozens of alleged paedophiles arrested overseas for child sex offences. There were some 66 such arrests last year. At the same time, the protection of children in Britain is ‘compromised’ by the system of court orders for child rapists and molesters, the report states. Only 2,658 Sexual Offender Prevention Orders supposed to control dangerous paedophiles in Britain were imposed in 2011/12. The review was commissioned by the Association of Chief Police Officers and written by a leading QC, Hugh Davies, and police experts. It found gaping holes in the regime for stopping paedophiles from travelling overseas. Police can apply for a Foreign Travel Order to keep them in the UK, and anyone on the sex offenders’ register must notify the police if they intend to go abroad. But the report said the number of such orders was ‘absurdly small’ compared to the number of known sex offenders and ‘even the lowest estimates of extra-territorial offending by identifiable British nationals’. Greater protection: In the wake of the Oxford sex ring ran by Mohammed Karrar, left, and Bassam Karrar, right, local MP Nicola Blackwood is pushing for new laws to safeguard children . It added that this ‘tends to demonstrate... that the orders are intrinsically flawed’. In 2007 not one order was handed down by the courts. The report said: ‘The UK’s ability effectively to police the conduct of high-risk sex offenders abroad is highly compromised. ‘The irresistible conclusion is that serious sexual offending against children has occurred and is occurring in many jurisdictions in a culture of near impunity.’ The report is also damning about the Sexual Offender Prevention Orders which can be used to put strict controls on a sex offender’s behaviour in Britain. But police can apply for an order only for someone who already has a conviction for sex crimes, and must show evidence of subsequent threatening behaviour – which is often hard to prove. The report says the ‘fundamental flaws’ in the orders are ‘serious and in need of immediate remedy’. It adds: ‘The existing regime simply serves to compromise effective child protection.’ The report was uncovered by Tory backbencher Nicola Blackwood, who today launches a major campaign designed to fix flaws in child protection. Campaign: Nicola Blackwood MP is seeking to fix flaws in child protection . The Oxford West and Abingdon MP is demanding new laws to protect children in the wake of the Oxford sex ring scandal. Her Childhood Lost campaign is backed by leading children’s charities including Barnardo’s, the NSPCC and Save the Children. Miss Blackwood is suggesting a new ‘Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Order’ which would consolidate all existing orders into one and be easier for police to obtain. It would last five years and could be used on someone without a conviction if there was evidence of the danger they pose to children. Miss Blackwood is also petitioning David Cameron to set up specialist child sexual exploitation centres and for new guidance for judges to ensure tough sentencing in child sexual abuse cases. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Whilst we have some of the toughest powers in the world to deal with sex offenders, we keep them under constant review, and will consider proposals like this.’ Cases which have caused alarm include that of Gary Glitter who was jailed in Britain in 1999 and listed as a sex offender for downloading child abuse pictures. Despite this he was able to travel to South East Asia. In 2005 he was arrested by the Vietnamese police and convicted of molesting two girls. At the time critics raised concerns about the apparent ease with which Glitter was able to travel. A Sexual Offender Prevention Order could have restricted his movements, but was not imposed.","There are 65,000 registered sex offenders in the UK, but only 50 orders to prevent them travelling abroad .

An investigative panel has requested the school records of Sandy Hook school shooter Adam Lanza after revealing that he was a deeply isolated individual who bounced between several schools. A panel convened by Connecticut's child advocate office is seeking new information on Lanza, it was revealed today including the release of his school records. Lanza was the gunman responsible for the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, killing 26 people, 20 of them children. Connecticut's child advocate office has requested the release of Adam Lanza's (pictured), school records. Lanza was the lone gunman responsible for the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, killing 26 people, including 20 first-graders . Lanza's records are being requested as . part of an investigation in conjunction with Connecticut's Child . Fatality Review Panel. The panel reviews unexpected child . fatalities. It has obtained some of Lanza's school and hospital records, . but the state attorney general asked on the panel's behalf for the . release of his educational records. 'I think from our perspective right now . from what we've gathered, we're concerned about the level of isolation,' said Faith Vos Winkel, assistant child advocate. 'It's never one thing. I think a theme that is beginning to emerge for us - how it plays out, . what it ultimately looks like, I'm not sure - is that this was a very . isolated kid.' Teenagers and young adults typically are involved in sports, clubs, jobs, community activities and have friends, Vos Winkel said. Lanza, apparently, was the opposite of this. 'I think at least from what we're gleaning at this point there was very little of that,' she said. Vos Winkel even compared the case to a 5,000-piece puzzle and said officials had only a limited number of pieces. 'Piecing this enormous complex puzzle together, we're beginning to see some education disruption certainly in middle school and, we believe, in high school,' Vos Winkel said. 'I think education disruption is a feature. Those will be some of the issues we're going to explore more fully.' Lanza attended various middle schools, was homeschooled and appears to have spent a limited amount of time enrolled in high school. Lanza was responsible for the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting after he killed his mother at their home. He killed himself as police arrived at the school. Mourners gather in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut last December . Others have also requested the release of Lanza's school records, including Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen. The child advocate's office first sought Lanza's school records in March, but Newtown school officials have not released the information. District officials did not immediately return a phone message left Monday. The child advocate's office has subpoenaed many records, not just school documents, Vos Winkel said. 'Our desire here is to understand the . constellation of issues in this young man's life and make, hopefully, . an informed and thoughtful analysis of this,' Vos Winkel told The Courant. 'So if we talk about prevention … what are the signs and indicators we . need to know when kids are suicidal or homicidal?' she said.

The mother of a British businessman murdered in China has urged the Chinese government to make his killer pay £5million in compensation. Gu Kailai, the wife of former top Communist Party politician Bo Xilai, was jailed for life last year for poisoning Neil Heywood, 41, whose death in 2011 sparked a massive political scandal in China. Ann Heywood said her son’s two children, aged eight and 12, who live in Beijing with their mother, Lulu, faced the insecurity of having no financial provision for their future. 'Compassion': The mother of murdered British businessman Neil Heywood, left, has called on China to end his family's nightmare - Gu Kailai, right, was jailed last year for poisoning Mr Heywood . Mrs Heywood, of south London, blamed . prominent officials including a member of the Communist Party’s . politburo and police bosses of orchestrating a cover-up. She added: ‘While struggling to come . to terms with my own grief, my overriding concern has been for the . security and wellbeing of Neil’s children. ‘Given the circumstances of Neil’s . murder, I have been surprised and disappointed that, despite repeated . discreet approaches to Chinese authorities, there has been no . substantive or practical response.’ Chinese law allows for a murder victim’s family to be compensated by convicted killers. Li Xiaolin, a lawyer who has . represented Gu’s family, said: ‘Talks started last year, but have not . reached agreement. Gu Kailai has no money.’ Human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang said: . ‘Compensation should have been decided at the time of Gu Kailai’s . trial, but it appears it was not. This is very strange. ‘The government can compel the sale of assets to pay compensation.’ However, in such a sensitive case, the upper echelons of Communist Party would have to agree to any deal. ‘Decisions about this case have to be . made single-handedly by the Communist Party’s top leaders,’ said He . Weifang, a law professor at Beijing University. Mrs Heywood urged China to show . ‘decisiveness and compassion’ to ‘enable my family to achieve some kind . of closure to our ongoing nightmare’. She explained that, in the months after Mr Heywood's death, it became clear that he had not died from natural causes but was the victim of murder. 'It also became clear that prominent Chinese officials, including a member of the Communist Party's politburo and a number of senior policemen, were connected with the murder and involved in a systematic coverup,' she said. After initially refusing to speak to the media to spare Chinese authorities unnecessary embarrassment, their lack of any 'substantive or practical response' had compelled her to break her silence, Mrs Heywood added. Compensation: Mr Heywood's family is seeking compensation from his convicted killer Gu Kailai, seen with her husband Bo Xilai in 2007 . A source close to Mr Heywood's Chinese widow, Lulu, said she had been pushing for compensation for herself and their two young children. Li Xiaolin said Heywood's family was seeking between 30 million and 50 million yuan in compensation. Bo was sacked as Communist Party chief of the southwestern city of Chongqing last year when his wife was named as an official suspect in the November 2011 murder of Heywood, a long-time friend of the couple who also helped their son, Bo Guagua, settle into study in Britain. Bo is now awaiting trial on charges of corruption, taking bribes and of bending the law. The government originally implicated Bo in helping to cover up Heywood's murder, but the legal indictment issued last month made no mention of that and it is unclear if the case will be included in his trial, likely to start this month. The British Embassy in Beijing said it had passed on the family's concerns about a lack of progress on the compensation request to the Chinese government. 'We've made the Chinese authorities, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, aware of the family's concerns on several occasions since the trial, most recently twice during July,' said an embassy spokesman, who did not elaborate. Mrs Heywood said: 'Given the circumstances of Neil's murder, I have been surprised and disappointed that, despite repeated discreet approaches to the Chinese authorities, there has been no substantive or practical response.' China's Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Chinese law stipulates that victims of crime can seek compensation from those convicted of crimes, but does not lay out monetary benchmarks, which are generally decided by the courts depending on ability to pay and the nature of the crime. While assets ordered confiscated by courts can be used for compensation, Gu's verdict - as relayed by official state media - made no mention of asset confiscation. 'Compensation should have been decided upon at the time of Gu Kailai's trial, but it appears it was not. This is very strange,' said Pu Zhiqiang, a prominent human rights lawyer. 'The government can compel the sale of assets to pay compensation,""'which for murder cases was generally several hundred thousand yuan, he added. However, for such a sensitive case as this, the upper echelons of ruling Communist Party would have to sign off on a compensation deal, making any court involvement moot. 'Decisions about this case have to be made single-handedly by the Communist Party's top leaders. It's not for a court or the government to decide,' said He Weifang, a law professor at Peking University who has closely followed Bo's downfall. Bo, 64, was widely seen as pursuing a powerful spot in the party's top decision-making body before his career unravelled after his former police chief, Wang Lijun, fled to a U.S. consulate for more than 24 hours in February last year and alleged that Bo's wife Gu had killed Heywood. At her trial in August of last year, Gu admitted to poisoning Heywood, alleging that she had acted after he had threatened her son, Bo Guagua, when a business deal turned sour, according to official accounts published by state media.","Businessman, 41, poisoned by wife of top Communist Party figure in 2011 .

I went to sleep . eventually, woke up the next morning, and then did the same again.’ After he was found he was taken to . hospital where he spent three and a half weeks recovering from bad . bruising from his abdomen to his knees. Mr Lee’s son Jules said the . family was considering legal action. He added: ‘At the age of 99 how can . you expect someone to always remember to wear a pendant? ‘As far as I’m concerned, the intercom . is the only way they could guarantee his safety because it’s a . guaranteed check once a day.’ Looking out: Second World War veteran Harold Lee sits in his flat after recovering from a fall in Derby . Cuts: Mr Lee now has to pay 42p per day for an intercom service at his home in Derby, pictured . Mr Lee claims he was contacted by . Derwent Living about the 42p charge just a couple of months before the . free intercom was taken away. Derwent Living insisted it had . organised a 12-month campaign to give residents, carers and next of kin . notice, and blamed the change on cuts in the amount of cash it is given . by Derby City Council. The free ‘daily welfare call’ had been covered by . the council, but ended after the authority’s housing-related support . budget was cut from £6,472,000 in 2012-13 to £3,739,000 in this . financial year. Gemma Trowbridge, from Derwent Living, . said an alternative was made available at a ‘small fee’ but some . residents had chosen not to take up the service. She added: ‘We were disappointed by . the council’s decision to cut the funding. Our thoughts are with Harold . and his family following  his distress.’ She said a programme of daily . support for Mr Lee was now in place.

Upset: Mr Lee was rescued from his ordeal only when his grandson went to visit him . Councillor Mark Tittley, cabinet member for adults and health, expressed his ‘deep regret’ for what happened. He added: ‘The council recognises that . housing-related support services are valuable to help vulnerable people . live independently.

Simpson, pictured in May, is going up for auction online . The lavish Florida home where O.J. Simpson lived for nearly a decade before heading to prison will be auctioned off online, it has emerged. A Miami-Dade County judge signed off the deal on Wednesday, two years after JP Morgan Chase filed to foreclose the disgraced NFL star's four-bedroom four-bathroom home in Kendall. The bank will take possession of the house on Tuesday and it will go on sale online on a auction website on October 29, the South Florida Business Journal reported. He had stopped paying his mortgage in 2010 and owed the bank $892,283.11, including the $660,000-principal, fees, interests and court costs. He also owed four years in taxes, the judge ruled. Simpson bought the 4,334-square-foot house, which also has a swimming pool, in 2000 for $575,000, but was financially . destroyed by court orders related to his acquittal for the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ronald Goldman in 1997. While he was found not guilty, he was found liable and a Los Angeles judge ordered him to pay $33.5 million for the wrongful death of Goldman. The families are still trying to collect the money. After the ruling, he moved to Florida and bought the home as the state's laws protected a primary residence from being seized to pay off a civil judgment, RadarOnline reported. On sale: It comes two years after JP Morgan Chase filed to foreclose Simpson's Florida home, pictured .

Simpson remains behind bars in Nevada after being convicted of armed robbery and kidnapping in Las Vegas in 2008. But last month he was granted parole for some of the charges, and he could get parole for the other charges within the next 18 months. Simpson had appeared before a two-member parole panel to plead for leniency, expressing regret for his actions and saying that he has been a model inmate.

Householders could be banned from buying a deadly pesticide that caused serious pollution on a renowned fishing river. Scientists investigating the incident believe that someone may have poured only two teaspoons of the poison down a kitchen sink but it was enough to wipe out all the bug life along a ten-mile stretch of the Kennet. It killed all the freshwater shrimp, caddis fly and mayfly, leaving trout and other fish with nothing to feed on and in turn hitting predators up the food chain such as otters, kingfishers and herons. The pesticide entered the Kennet, pictured, at Marlborough in Wiltshire via a sewage pumping station and affected the river as far downstream as Hungerford in Berkshire . The pesticide entered the Kennet at Marlborough in Wiltshire via a sewage pumping station and affected the river as far downstream as Hungerford in Berkshire. At the height of the alert last month, people were warned not to let river water between the two towns come into contact with their skin, to stop children splashing in it and not to eat the trout caught in it. Now Environment Minister Richard Benyon has ordered his staff at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to investigate how the pesticide, chlorpyrifos, can be banned from general domestic use. Mr Benyon, who owns a country estate flanking the Kennet further downstream near Reading, said he was alarmed to find ‘how easy’ it was to buy the pesticide online. ‘I have asked Defra to find out why this chemical is so readily available and to suggest what restrictions we should be imposing,’ he said. ‘I’m firmly on the side of those who want to make sure this never happens again. Something as toxic as this should only be available to people with the qualifications to use it safely. It killed all the freshwater shrimp, pictured, caddis fly and mayfly along a ten-mile stretch of the Kennet in Wiltshire, leaving fish with nothing to feed on . ‘I’ve asked Defra’s chemical regulations directorate to provide me with advice and I will act upon it. We want to make sure in the medium to the long term that we are protecting rivers like this from pollution incidents, whether they come from agricultural use or personal use. Somebody could have just been cleaning out their garden, trying to clean algae out of their fishpond. We don’t know. ‘Whether we get to prosecutions or not, I don’t know. The important thing is that we look at every aspect of this, making sure that the availability of this chemical is investigated.’ The Kennet, which flows down to Reading where it joins the Thames, is renowned in angling circles for the purity of its water and the fatness of its trout, and there are syndicates along the river near Hungerford where anglers pay up to £3,000 a season for their sport. Chlorpyrifos is regularly used on lawns and golf courses and to tackle insects on crops and some soft fruits. It was banned in Singapore in 2009 for use in termite control in soil and the US phased out chlorpyrifos for use in buildings and on construction sites from 2001 due to public health and environmental concerns.","Pesticide kill freshwater shrimp, caddis fly and mayfly in Kennet ."

British buyers are snapping up entire villages in Spain for a fifth of the price of the average semi-detached home here. Property bargain-hunters are making the most of Spain's economic crisis to buy homes locals can no longer afford to keep. Most of the tiny villages have been in the hands of the same families for generations, but in many cases their inhabitants have moved away to urban areas and the houses have fallen into disrepair. Bargain: Briton Neil Christie snapped up the entire Spanish village of Arrunada for just £39,000 . DIY: Mr Christie has had to completely rebuild some of the houses in his village . Ghost towns: Many of the villages in rural Spain have been abandoned after families moved away and couldn't afford to maintain the properties . Unable to afford to maintain or restore them, they are being sold at knockdown prices. Estate agents say 80 per cent are being bought by foreigners - and a third of buyers are British. Father-of-two Neil Christie bought the hamlet of Arrunada in an idyllic corner of rural north west Spain for just 45,000 euros - or £39,000. That is just a fifth of the price of the average semi-detached house in Britain, at £201,427, according to the most recent Land Registry statistics. Even after he has totally renovated the four dilapidated properties, he expects to have spent no more than £140,000 on the project. Former ITV transmission controller Mr Christie, 61, fell in love with the area while holidaying with his Peruvian wife Rosa. Scenic: Mr Christie and his wife Rosa will be able to enjoy amazing views once the main house is finished . Economic crisis: Around 80 per cent of properties like this are sold to foreign buyers as Spain struggles financially, estate agents said . The couple have moved from their former home in Cumbria and are now staying in a . nearby village where Mrs Christie works as a schoolteacher, while Mr . Christie spends his time renovating their future home. He said the work has not been a . project 'for the faint hearted' and that the main house had no roof and a . tree growing in the living room when he arrived. But he has no regrets about investing in the village. 'Apart from when I’m running out of tea bags there’s absolutely ­nothing . I miss,' he told the Sunday People. 'The work I did in England could be very stressful. I found it . difficult to relax at times. 'Here I’ve got zero pollution, fresh air and fresh water and I haven’t had to bankrupt myself to get it.' Specialist estate agents are selling the abandoned villages from £53,000 to £385,000. Buyers . tend to be middle class couples in their 50s or 60s looking for . somewhere for their retirement, said estate agent Rafael Canales. Ruins: Some of the villages are cheap to buy but would take considerable work to make habitable . In need of renovation: The village of Pena Bella is on the market for £53,000 . His business partner Pepe Rodil said Spanish families were selling up because they no longer had the money to maintain the properties and because who had moved away to towns and cities saw returning to the countryside as 'a backwards step'. He said: 'Foreigners are filling . the gap. I’m happy to see villages which were falling down being . renovated. It makes me sad to see them in ruins.' Even the most expensive village on . the pair's books, El Costal, has a price tag of £385,000 - or to put it . another way, £10,000 less than the average London flat. The five-property village needs minimal renovation work and comes with 60 acres of land and amazing views. Resale prices of homes in the right . location can be considerable.

Twenty-five men who claimed they were abused by former Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky, have reached settlements with the university. The university's lawyer revealed that 25 lawsuits had been settled out of the 31 that were filed against the former school's assistant football coach. Among the victims to receive a settlement is the accused's adopted son, Matt Sandusky, who finalized a deal with Penn State lawyers on Friday. A total of 25 of Jerry Sandusky's victims reached settlements with Penn State lawyers yesterday. The former assistant football coach (pictured) is serving 30 years in prison for sexual abuse . Matt . Sandusky had been expected to be a defense witness for his father until . the trial, when he told investigators that he also had been abused by . Jerry Sandusky. He has since petitioned for a legal name change for . himself and his family. More than a dozen additional victims who had not come forward with their allegations during Sandusky's trial in June 2012 reached settlements yesterday, with the university paying out 'millions of dollars' to victims. Jerry Sandusky was the longtime defensive coordinator at Penn State and ran a charity for underprivileged children in his spare time. Prosecutors said Sandusky used the charity, The Second Mile to find and groom victims whom he would bring to Penn State football games and facilities, where he molested them. He was convicted in June 2012 of 45 counts of sexual abuse and sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison. Philadelphia-based attorneys Joel Feller and Matt Casey represented seven of Sandusky's victims, including Matt Sandusky and three men who testified at the trial. Victims who had not come forward with their allegations during Sandusky's trial in June 2012 were granted settlements by the Pennsylvania university yesterday . A statement released by the two lawyers on Friday quoted one of Sandusky's victims, known as Victim 7, who said: 'despite the settlements, my life will never feel back to normal.' 'If I had the power to go back in time and not ever meet Jerry Sandusky, I wouldn't hesitate.' Neither the victims' lawyers nor the university's would reveal the exact amount of money that was awarded to victims the wake of Sandusky's conviction. Matt Rozen, the legal representative for Penn State said the university tried to round off all of the negotiations at the same time. Mr Rozen told ABC news yesterday, the accusers were divided into three groups -  those who said they were abused before1998, between 1998 and 2001, and after 200 to correspomd with when university employees and officials were made aware of Sandusky's alleged behaviour. He said: 'The range of resolution dollars varied on those factors. 'Every lawyer representing a claimant was well aware of those different stratifications, and accepted there are real differences between and among those claimants.' Settled: Matt Sandusky, right, the adopted son of former Penn State University assistant football coach settled with the university over sex abuse claims on Friday . On Friday it was revealed that ""Victim 2"" said he was the boy the . then-graduate assistant coach, Mike McQueary, testified he saw being attacked by . Jerry Sandusky in a team shower in 2001. Mr McQueary notified school . officials at the time, but police were never called. Mr Casey, one of the victims' lawyers, did not disclose the terms of the settlements, but said they took shape . some time ago and were completed more than week ago, followed by passing . paperwork back and forth to memorialize them. 'To say they're relieved, I think, is a . fair statement,' Casey said on August 23. 'But it's also accurate to say that while . we've closed this chapter, there's a whole lot of this that's . necessarily inadequate.' A sick man: Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky arrives at the Centre County Courthouse for a post-sentencing hearing January 10, 2013 . Over a week ago, a lawyer disclosed . the first settlement among the 31 lawsuits filed against the school amid . the Sandusky scandal. Earlier last week, a lawyer brought in by Penn . State to facilitate negotiations said he expected 24 more cases to . settle in the near future. A Penn State spokesman on Friday said only that settlement talks continued to progress. He declined further comment. The school has spent nearly $50 million on the Sandusky scandal, not including any payments to the victims and accusers. Other . lawyers involved in settlement talks said on Friday they were still . working with the university but none had a signed, final agreement. A sad ending: Legendary Penn State football coach Joe Paterno was fired before the end of the 2011 season amid the scandal and died only months later . Sandusky spent three decades at Penn . State under former head coach Joe Paterno. A 1998 complaint about . Sandusky showering with a boy - one of those who testified against him - . was investigated by university police but no charges were filed. McQueary witnessed a different incident involving ""Victim 2"" in the team . shower in 2001 and notified Paterno and other high-ranking school . officials, but police were not called. The . response of university leaders, including Paterno, was heavily . criticized in a report commissioned by the school last year. Paterno . died in January 2012, but criminal charges for an alleged cover-up are . pending against three others: former president Graham Spanier, retired . vice president Gary Schultz and retired athletic director Tim Curley. All three deny the allegations. Sandusky, . 69, was convicted of 45 counts of child sexual abuse and is serving a . decades-long state prison sentence.
