"(CNN) -- In watching Mitt Romney's painful -- and self-destructive -- gaffe about the ""47 percenters,"" it at first seemed inexplicable, as if the man was writing off half of the electorate. Never mind that the self-declared ""victims"" he's talking about include seniors (who actually voted Republican in 2010) and veterans (many of whom might be inclined to vote for the GOP). Or that they're also people who work hard and pay their payroll taxes, and might be getting some tax benefits for their children. So what is it about Mitt Romney, who should know these things -- and probably does -- that makes him so gaffe-prone? Another way to ask the question: Why does a smart man say such stupid things? iReport: I'm the 47% but - You're WRONG Mitt Romney! I have a theory about this. In spending a lot of time this year thinking about Romney -- and speaking with those who know him the best, politically and personally while reporting a CNN documentary -- this much appears to be true: Romney has a businessman's approach to politics. Which means: He sizes up a situation (or an audience). He figures out what he needs to do to cut the deal. Then he does it, and expects it to work. Ergo, Romney speaks to a group of conservative GOP fat cats, and tells them what he thinks they want to hear so they will cough up the dough. Belief is almost beside the point. He was closing the deal. Here's something to know: While Romney was born into politics, he's not a natural-born politician. His father may have been a three-term Michigan governor, but he told his son to go into business first. So he did. And now Romney is a numbers guy who came to the ideological part of politics late. And it shows, especially when you are asking voters to trust what you believe to become president. Some politicians are hatched out of strong loyalty to a cause or a party. Romney is a businessman who came to politics out of a strong sense of duty -- and belief in his own ability to repair what's broken. Getting elected is what you have to do so you can do what you're good at: fixing things. (In an odd way, kind of like President Obama, who also believes getting elected is what you have to do so you can do what you're good at: transforming things.) Romney has had much success painting the self-portrait as a Mr. Fix-it. While he couldn't defeat Ted Kennedy, he did become the governor of the liberal state of Massachusetts in 2002, running as a pro-choice moderate. Opinion: How Romney really feels about Republicans . Once in office, though, when confronted with the difficult issue of abortion -- and looking at a presidential bid in the ever more conservative GOP -- he flipped, explaining to me that it was a matter of conscience, tempered by the reality of political power. ""I realized what sounded good in a campaign, when I actually became the governor and would be the person who would sign a piece of legislation which could take human life -- I simply couldn't do that,"" he told me. But there's no doubt about it: Romney had to move to the right to try and get the nomination, so he did in the 2008 campaign. And he did it again in 2012. In trying to explain Romney's jujitsu, former adviser Alex Castellanos told me that Romney's journey on social issues was the journey of a businessman who ""mainly looked at governing as an economic proposition, all of a sudden confronting some social issues as a mature adult responsible for human life. And so he did evolve there."" Fast-forward to the ""severely conservative"" candidate of the 2012 primaries. And to the latest fundraiser chat in which Romney says half of the American public believes it has been victimized, and the government needs to take care of them. CNNMoney: Romney's '47% . All of which leads to this question: Does Romney believe any of this stuff? In the end, it's hard to know. But I'll subscribe to a theory advanced by David Brooks in The New York Times today: that Romney is a ""decent man who says stupid things because he is pretending to be something he is not -- some sort of cartoonish government-hater."" Maybe that's what Romney thought he needed to be to cut the deal. But the problem is, presidential politics isn't just business. It's personal.

"(CNN) -- (CNN) -- Two skiers missing after a weekend avalanche in the Colorado mountains were found dead Sunday, authorities said. A search and rescue team worked to remove the bodies from the steep terrain Sunday, said Betty Benson, a spokeswoman for the Lake County Office of Emergency Management. Searchers braved ""very, very steep"" terrain and high risks of another snowslide while following signals from the emergency beacons the skiers wore, Susan Matthews, another emergency management spokeswoman said Sunday. A record level of snow this winter and changing wind patterns have combined to create ""very unstable conditions"" on Colorado mountains, Matthews said. ""For those people who are not prepared to be in those backcountry conditions, unfortunate incidents happen."" The two skiers were part of a group of seven who were caught in the rugged backcountry east of Aspen on Saturday. Officials have not released the names of the skiers. One of the three survivors was released from a hospital Sunday, while two others were transferred to other medical centers and two more were unharmed, Lake County authorities said. The reported injuries included a broken leg, a broken ankle, a possible broken rib and a collapsed lung, county authorities said. Saturday's avalanche follows a string of deadly snowslides that killed six people last week -- two each in Colorado, Utah and Oregon. The Colorado Avalanche Information Center has issued warnings that cover much of the state's ski country throughout the weekend. The center warns of ""unusual conditions"" in the Rocky Mountains -- weak layers beneath the surface of the snowpack, rapid warming and strong winds -- that can lead to ""unusual and surprising avalanches."" ""We are seeing very dangerous avalanche conditions developing from basically the New Mexico border north to Wyoming,"" the center said in an advisory issued Saturday. ""And the problem list is about as complicated as it can get. We are seeing very large avalanches taking out very old trees, mine buildings that have been around for many decades, and avalanches burying roadways with 20 feet of debris. ""People have been getting caught and killed in avalanches recently. These are glaring, flashing and obvious clues that things are not all good across our backcountry. We are seeing a snowpack that is teetering on the brink of critical mass."" Avalanches kill 6 in the western United States . Grandson of Vail resort co-founder killed in Colorado avalanche .

"(CNN) -- A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and undocumented immigrant who was detained at a southern Texas airport this week said Wednesday the incident wasn't a stunt. Asked how it was possible that he didn't know he would get extra scrutiny at the border airport, Jose Antonio Vargas told CNN's ""New Day"" that he didn't anticipate being detained in McAllen, Texas, after visiting a shelter where undocumented immigrant children were being held. ""Is it a stunt to get on a plane to leave to try to get out of south Texas?"" he asked. About his detention, he added: ""That's the risk undocumented people take every day."" On Tuesday, U.S. Border Patrol agents detained the journalist-turned-activist at McAllen-Miller International Airport after he told them he was in the country illegally, officials said. He was released later that day and given a notice to appear before an immigration judge. At the very least, Vargas likely knew after he'd arrived in McAllen last week that he might have difficulty leaving the area by plane or by land. In a piece that he wrote for Politico, he said acquaintances informed him after he arrived that Border Patrol agents check IDs at the airport, and that immigration checkpoints are set up along roads within 45 miles of the city. Vargas became an outspoken advocate pushing for an overhaul of the nation's immigration laws in 2011, when he revealed he was undocumented -- having entered the United States from the Philippines as a child -- in a column for The New York Times Magazine. Vargas was detained at the McAllen airport while trying to pass through security en route to Los Angeles, said Ryan Eller, campaign director for Define American, a group Vargas founded in 2011. Earlier, he visited a shelter to ""highlight the stories of refugee children who have fled countries in Central America because of increased levels of violence,"" according to a statement on the website of United We Dream, a group that provides support to children and families. On Facebook Wednesday, Vargas wrote, ""We, the American people, must not allow our elected officials to further politicize the humanitarian crisis at the border. America does not turn its back on children -- then or now. We must (find) a solution to this crisis."" He wrote that the Rio Grande Valley in south Texas was ""the most militarized zone I've ever been to in the U.S. Can you imagine living there, being trapped in a 45-mile radius of check-points and border patrol agents? I only visited and I got out. I got out. What about other immigrants?"" Recently, Vargas detailed his life story in ""Documented,"" a film about the U.S. immigration debate that he wrote and directed. CNN aired it on June 29. Even with his high-profile and frequent speaking events about his immigration status, Vargas hadn't found himself in the cross hairs of authorities until his trip this month to the border region to support unaccompanied minors coming from Central America. ""Mr. Vargas has not previously been arrested by (Immigrations and Customs Enforcement,) nor has the agency ever issued a detainer on him or encountered him,"" the Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday. ""ICE is focused on smart, effective immigration enforcement that prioritizes the agency's resources to promote border security and to identify and remove criminal individuals who pose a threat to public safety and national security."" Vargas said he considered the possibility of detention after arriving in the region. ""Because I don't have any ID besides my Filipino passport, it's going to be hard for me to actually get out of here at some point when I decide to get out of here in the next couple of days,"" he told CNN on Sunday. Early Tuesday, Vargas tweeted that he was about to go through security at McAllen-Miller International Airport. Since outing himself as an undocumented immigrant three years ago, he says he has traveled extensively, visiting 40 states. ""I don't know what's going to happen,"" he tweeted, directing his followers to the Twitter handles for Define American and the University of Texas-Pan American's Minority Affairs Council. Within minutes, the latter retweeted a photo of Vargas in handcuffs with the caption: ""Here's a photo of (Vargas) in handcuffs, because the Border Patrol has nothing more pressing to do apparently."" In 1993, when he was 12, Vargas came to the United States from the Philippines with a man he'd never met but whom his aunt and a family friend introduced as his uncle, Vargas wrote in his 2011 New York Times Magazine column. Once in the States, he lived with his grandfather, a security guard, and grandmother, a food server. Both were naturalized American citizens who had been supporting Vargas and his mother since Vargas was 3. He'd later learn that his grandfather had paid $4,500 for this purported uncle -- who was a coyote, or people smuggler -- to bring Vargas to the United States under a fake passport and name.

"(CNN) -- Even the prospect of rain is little help to the crews fighting an Arizona wildfire that killed 19 of their comrades. But firefighters battling the Yarnell Hill blaze did get a boost from the U.S. military, which committed four specially equipped C-130 transports to the effort Tuesday. About 400 ground personnel and 100 incident management staff are working to control the fire, shadowed by the near-total loss of an elite team that was overrun by the spreading blaze Sunday. ""You have to acknowledge it,"" Karen Takai, a spokeswoman for the firefighting effort, told reporters Tuesday morning. ""You can't push it behind in your head, but acknowledge it, and then they get their head back in the game. They have to focus very hard on the ground, or we'll be in that same circumstance again."" And though Tuesday's forecast calls for about a 25% chance of thunderstorms, those squalls could bring gusts of 50 to 80 mph, lightning and only ""spotty"" rain, National Weather Service forecaster Jim Wallmann told reporters. ""Although 80 miles per hour is unlikely, the potential there is for stronger winds than what we saw on Sunday afternoon,"" Wallmann said. Meanwhile, temperatures in the 90s are expected to prevail throughout the week, he said. The fire had scorched about 8,400 acres Tuesday morning and was largely unchanged Tuesday afternoon, incident commander Clay Templin told a public meeting. How to help the families . The region has been suffering from an extreme drought, and the winds whipping through the mountains can blow embers into new patches of parched woodland and mesquite grass, Takai said. ""That mesquite is extremely oily, and once that starts, an ember gets into those extremely dry fuels, that fire is going to rip,"" she said. ""It's very difficult to control at that degree, especially with the winds that we're having out here."" The fire has scorched about 13 square miles of the mountains outside Prescott, 80 miles northwest of Phoenix. It remained completely uncontained Tuesday morning, Takai said. Late Monday afternoon, the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office advised residents in the communities of Peeples Valley and Yarnell to evacuate their dwellings. An estimated 200 homes and other structures have burned in Yarnell. Though firefighters got a break with higher humidity and brief showers Tuesday morning, ""The winds are just drying out that fuel right after the rain is hitting the ground,"" Takai said. ""It's a pattern that is very difficult to work with."" Remembering those who were killed . The C-130 crews now joining the fight will have their work cut out for them in battling what is now considered the deadliest fire in state history. Equipped with the Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System, or MAFFS, the planes, loaded with water or fire retardant, can drop 3,000 gallons in less than five seconds. The retardant covers an area one-quarter of a mile long and 60 feet wide, and the aircraft can land, reload and be airborne again in under 20 minutes. ""They'll be capable of actually dropping a lot of liquid on that ground in areas where it will be most effective,"" Takai said. The planes are from Colorado, where crews had been working on fires for the last several days. But they are now considered more vital for Arizona. The military deployment is coming at the request of civilian firefighting authorities. A Defense Department official confirmed the details to CNN but declined to be identified because an announcement has not yet been made. CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","80-mph wind gusts are ""unlikely"" but possible, forecaster says .

"(CNN) -- Rene Gonzalez, a Cuban convicted of spying in the United States, was released Friday after serving most of a 15-year sentence, a prison spokesman told CNN. Gonzalez was one of five convicted spies known as the ""Cuban Five"" who were arrested in 1998. A Miami jury in 2001 convicted members of what was called the Wasp Network on charges they had spied on prominent Cuban-American exile leaders and U.S. military bases. The five were Gonzalez; Ruben Campa, also known as Fernando Gonzalez; Gerardo Hernandez; Luis Medina (also known as Ramon Labanino); and Antonio Guerrero. Hernandez, the group's leader, also was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder for engineering the shoot-down of two planes flown by the group Brothers to the Rescue in 1996. Gonzalez is the first of the five to be released from prison. He was behind bars for 13 years and 26 days, said his attorney, Philip Horowitz. But he still has three years of probation to serve, said Neil Robinson, spokesman for the federal prison in Marianna, Florida. Gonzalez was freed about 4 a.m., Horowitz said. ""I cannot discuss or disclose what he is doing and where he is going in order to protect his personal safety,"" he said. ""Mr. Gonzalez is glad to be out but it is a bittersweet day because his four friends are still in prison. He wishes he could return to his family in Cuba as quickly as the judge permits."" Gonzalez will appeal the conditions of his probation so that he may serve it in Cuba instead of the United States, Horowitz said. Gonzalez has a 25-year-old daughter and a 13-year-old daughter who was only 4 months old when he was arrested. During the trial, the defendants claimed they had spied as a way to defend Cuba from hardline anti-Castro groups in Miami they feared would attack the island. The case has been widely followed in Cuba, where the men were regarded as heroes and whose former leader, Fidel Castro, regularly advocated their release. Gonzalez was born on Chicago's north side in 1956, but his parents brought him to their native Cuba in 1961 so that the family could join Castro's revolution. U.S. authorities accused the Wasp Network of spying on an American naval base in Key West, Florida, and militant anti-Castro Cuban groups in Miami. Throughout Cuba, Gonzalez and the four other convicted spies are considered ""political prisoners,"" unjustly punished in American courts. They are known simply as ""Los Cinco,"" or the Cuban Five, and their faces appear on billboards. State-controlled Cuban media labels them ""terrorism fighters"" because they infiltrated Cuban-American groups in South Florida that the Cuban government alleges was bent on terrorizing the island in the 1990s. That era marked severe financial difficulties for Cuba because the country lost subsidies from the collapsed Soviet Union. The Cuban government renewed its tourism sector to bring in hard cash. But several Cuban tourist destinations were bombed during that decade, and the Castro regime lodged a protest with the United States over what it claimed were Cuban exiles in America financing the attacks. CNN's Michael Martinez, Gustavo Valdes and Bill Mears contributed to this report.","Rene Gonzalez wants to serve his probation in Cuba .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- A member of the ""Cuban Five"" spy group renounced his United States citizenship at the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana on Monday, removing the final obstacle to his permanent return to the island. Rene Gonzalez, a Cuban intelligence officer, was a member of a network of agents in South Florida that the Cuban government said was gathering intelligence to prevent terrorist attacks against Cuba; U.S. federal prosecutors called them a dangerous spy cell. The men were convicted in 2001, and ever since they have been the focus of a campaign by Cuban officials to free them. Gonzalez was released from prison in October 2011 but was required to serve three years' probation in the United States. But on Friday U.S. District Judge Joan Lenard ruled that Gonzalez, who had already been allowed to temporarily return to Cuba for his father's funeral, could stay there if he renounced his U.S. citizenship. In her ruling she wrote that federal prosecutors had said Gonzalez would be less of security risk to the United States if he returned to Cuba. Previously prosecutors had argued that Gonzalez should not be allowed to return to Cuba. Gonzalez, who had dual Cuban and American citizenship, arrived Monday at the U.S. Interest Section in Havana to renounce his citizenship surrounded by his family and U.S. attorney. ""Rene went in and filled out all the paperwork necessary to renounce his citizenship,"" said his attorney Phil Horowitz. ""He will be able to stay in Cuba after a couple more processes, and after the State Department issues a certificate of loss of nationality, he will be able to stay in Cuba forever."" Former federal employee charged in spy conspiracy . Gonzalez is the first of the Cuban Five to return the island. The other four men continue to serve lengthy sentences in U.S. federal prisons. Their case strained already shaky United States-Cuba relations. The Cuban government said that their agents had simply kept tabs on violent Cuban-American exile groups. But federal prosecutors argued the men also had tried to infiltrate U.S. military installations and had provided information that led to the 1996 downing of two planes from the group Brothers to the Rescue, which searched for boats stranded in the Florida Straits. Four men flying from Florida to Cuba were shot down and killed by Cuban air force jets. In 2012 Cuban officials offered to negotiate the release of the Cuban Five for Alan Gross, the U.S. State Department contractor jailed in Cuba for transporting banned communications equipment to the island. But U.S. officials rebuffed those overtures, saying Gross had not spied in Cuba.","'Cuban Five' renounces U.S. citizenship as condition of staying in Cuba .

"Sydney (CNN) -- It might be surprising that in a country as wealthy, multicultural and big as Australia, one of the key election battles is about asylum seekers and refugees. Both major parties are engaged in a race to the bottom about how best to shut down Australia as a place of refuge for people who take to the sea. Asylum seekers are an easy target for anxieties about national security, unemployment and demographic composition. Politicians have fueled fears that asylum seekers present a threat not only to the integrity of our borders, but to the national fabric as a whole. Their policies rely on a spurious dichotomy between the ""good refugee"" (who waits patiently in a camp to be resettled in a faraway land) and the ""bad refugee"" (who ""jumps the queue"" by engaging people smugglers to come by boat). International law makes no such distinction because a person either has a well-founded fear of persecution and is in need of protection, or does not. Australia's bid to stop 'queue jumpers' The ""queue jumper"" narrative has permeated so deeply that it has enabled both political parties to construct extraordinary legislative and policy interventions: Mandatory detention for all unlawful arrivals; the excision of the whole Australian mainland from Australia's ""migration zone;"" the removal of boat arrivals to offshore processing centers in small Pacific island countries, with no prospect for resettlement in Australia; and the creation of temporary protection visas, barring ""genuine"" refugees from family reunion and permanent residence. Despite originally decrying such draconian measures as inhuman and illegal, the Labor government, led by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, has built upon many of them and increased their severity. For a time, it explained that its deterrence measures had an underlying humanitarian objective -- to ""save lives at sea."" But the latest iterations of its policy reveal a strong message of punitive deterrence. OPINION: Why Australia's asylum plan won't work . In 2012, the Labor government reopened offshore processing centers in Nauru and Papua New Guinea, despite vowing it would never do so. The idea was that the inferior conditions there, lack of legal advice and review mechanisms, and delayed resettlement (around five years) would deter asylum seekers from getting on boats. But it didn't work, largely because it ignores the reasons why people seek protection in the first place. So the government took it a step further, declaring in July 2013 that asylum seekers arriving by boat would now be sent to PNG for processing and resettlement. As full-page newspaper advertisements explained: ""If you come here by boat without a visa you won't be settled in Australia."" The Opposition's political plan . The opposition Coalition, led by Tony Abbott, countered with disincentives of its own. First, if elected in a federal vote on September 7, it will expand offshore processing and actively seek other resettlement countries for boat arrivals found to be refugees. READ MORE: Riots as Australia shuts door on asylum . Though it will be possible for them to be resettled in Australia, it will be a ""last resort"" -- and temporary. Refugee status will be reassessed every three years, family reunion will be banned, and only work for the dole will be allowed. The deleterious psychological effects of this ""limbo"" protection have been well documented. Furthermore, the last time the policy was used, more women and children got on to boats because of the bar on family reunions. Many died in the process. Secondly, the Coalition would appoint a three-star commander to protect Australia's borders. This is because it views the continued arrival of boat people as a national emergency requiring a military-led response. But according to a former chief of Australia's defense force, this is a misguided policy that would change nothing. Asylum seekers are not a defense issue. Thirdly, the Coalition also promises to ""turn back the boats"" when it is safe to do so. But it rarely will be because it is illegal to expose people to a risk of persecution or turn back an unseaworthy vessel and place the lives of passengers at risk. It also suggested it would buy up Indonesian fishing vessels to stop those boats being used by people smugglers, a suggestion that was dismissed by the Indonesian government as unworkable and derogatory. Fourthly, the Coalition has threatened to abolish the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT), the independent body that reviews decisions made by government officials about whether or not people are refugees. This is because the RRT has found that many governmental decisions are flawed. But rather than probing the quality of government decision making, the Coalition has decided to get rid of the reviewer. This undermines a central tenet of a functioning administrative law system. Life or death decisions cannot be reviewed. Further, the Coalition's weekend announcement that it will strip legal aid from asylum seekers increases this risk of poor initial decision making and heightens the chance of refoulement -- or the expulsion of people with the right to be recognized as refugees. A 'breach of international human rights' Both Labor and Coalition policies breach Australia's international human rights obligations in various ways. At the very least, they undermine the humanitarian purpose of the Refugee Convention. More significantly, they violate concrete legal obligations -- such as the individual right to seek asylum (and the right not to be subjected to penalties for arriving without a visa in such cases), the right to be free from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the right not to be arbitrarily detained, and the right to non-discrimination. A recent report by the U.N. Human Rights Committee underscored this. But because Australia has no bill of rights, it is very difficult to challenge such policies in domestic courts. Experience tells us that these policies do not ""stop the boats."" As former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser recently observed, ""No amount of deterrence can match the terror from which those who are genuine refugees are fleeing."" Instead, they lead to increased levels of trauma and mental illness among refugee communities, exorbitant financial costs, and desperate family members undertaking dangerous boat voyages to try to join their loved ones. Moreover, asylum seekers get on boats because Australia tries to prevent their arrival by other means. There is no such thing as a ""refugee visa"" to apply for before departure, and it is highly unlikely that refugees would be able to get a tourist or work visa because of the presumption that they would apply for asylum on arrival. It is a Catch-22. Australia is one of the few countries in the Asia-Pacific region that could offer durable protection to refugees, since most of its neighbors have not ratified the Refugee Convention and do not have the legal, financial or technical capacity to offer real protection. How many asylum seekers are there? To put all of this into context, in 2012 Australia received 17,202 asylum seekers by boat, its highest annual number, but only 1.47% of the world's asylum seekers. In the same period, it accepted 190,000 people through its skilled and family migration scheme. On a positive note, both parties will continue to resettle refugees directly from camps and urban settlements in other countries, as well as asylum seekers who come by plane who are found to be refugees. The total number of refugees accepted by Australia -- whether by overseas resettlement, plane arrivals or boat arrivals -- will be capped at 13,750 by the Coalition. Labor will increase that number to 20,000, and possibly up to 27,000 if there is a significant decline in the number of asylum seekers arriving by boat. Public perception at fault? The public perception is that asylum numbers are much higher than this, and many people do not understand why people flee in the first place. Given Australia's relative affluence and political stability, most voters have no conception of what it means to fear persecution or other forms of serious harm. In fact, perhaps the saddest irony of all is that precisely because the asylum issue has such a negligible impact on most Australians' everyday lives, they can choose to remain ignorant about the issue. Yet it still drives votes. Finally, the more that asylum seekers are made to disappear from our community, the less chance there is for Australians to get to know them as neighbors, colleagues or friends. As this happens, the chance for greater empathy and understanding also disappears. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality this week. Marriage is an institution intended for two people who love one another, who want to commit to lifetime bonding as mates, and to form a family, whether it's only the two of them, or also includes children. The traditional concept of marriage has evolved over time. In recent history, it has been defined by most religions, and the states, as one man and a woman. Yet there are millions of humans whose makeup is such that they are attracted to the same gender and share the universal human desire to bond with a lifetime mate. They're gays. In 2013, the vast majority of Americans have moved beyond prejudice toward gays and lesbians. Gay couples and their families have lived openly in our communities for more than 30 years, and we know them now as neighbors, family members and friends. In the course of living their daily lives, raising families and contributing to society, we've come to see that gay and lesbian Americans share the same hopes and dreams as everyone else. Yet for decades, we've had a political debate about opposite-gender vs. same-gender marriages that has created a constant undercurrent of unrest. What many public figures have known to be true about gay people in their personal lives has been -- until recently -- unacceptable to acknowledge openly in the political realm. Over the last several years, however, public opinion has pushed our political conversation forward dramatically. Four out of five young voters, of all faiths and political parties, support marriage equality, and even those who continue to oppose marriage rights for same-sex couples can see that it is inevitable. The problem is that even while public opinion has reached an all-time high on marriage equality, old laws discriminating against gay and lesbian Americans have stayed on the books, hurting gay couples and their families. Congress passed a law -- the Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA -- that forbade the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriage, although this is a matter, constitutionally, that most agree belongs to the states to decide. And that is the wrong that the Supreme Court set right this week. The court found DOMA to be unconstitutional -- and it also allowed marriage rights for same-sex couples to return to California. Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy ruled that restricting marriage to opposite-gender couples ""forces same-sex couples to live as married for the purpose of state law but unmarried for the purpose of federal law, thus diminishing the stability and predictability of basic personal relations the state has found it proper to acknowledge and protect."" Kennedy also said the law unfairly treated the 220,000 children of same-sex couples in American differently from the children of opposite-sex parents -- which we should all be able to agree is harsh, unnecessary and unjust. Ensuring that all children can grow up with the same federal benefits and protections afforded by their parents' marriage and legal status is crucial, and Kennedy rightly saw the impact of not only making marriages equal for federal purposes -- but making their families equal. Marriage is an institution that provides stability for society and for the family. By striking down DOMA and dismissing the appeal on California's Proposition 8, the Supreme Court has forged a bipartisan consensus that marriage is an important enough institution that it should apply to humans equally, regardless of gender. Importantly, the court also strengthened the foundation upon which advocates and officials will one day achieve marriage equality nationwide. That wasn't so hard now, was it? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile: Vast majority of young Americans support same-sex marriage .

"(CNN) -- Ernests Gulbis is no stranger to a controversial comment. The Latvian tennis star once described the press conferences of Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray as boring. Then there was the time he said the fact that marijuana was legal in the Netherlands was one of the reasons he liked playing in Rotterdam so much (although he quickly added that he didn't smoke himself, he just liked that way of thinking). Now, Gulbis has caused a stir thanks to his views on the sport's female players, telling reporters at the French Open in Paris he hopes his younger sisters don't become tennis professionals because women need to think about having children. ""Hopefully they're not going to pursue a professional tennis career,"" Gulbis said. ""A woman needs to enjoy life a little bit more, needs to think about family, needs to think about kids."" He added that female tennis players can't think about having kids until they are in their late 20s, and ""that's tough for a woman."" Unsurprisingly, Gulbis' comments were picked up on social media sites Friday with many decrying the remarks as sexist. But Maria Sharapova, who defeated Paula Ormaechea 6-0, 6-0 Friday to move into the fourth round of the ladies draw, played down any controversy. ""I don't think we can take everything serious when he speaks,"" Sharapova laughingly said in her post match press conference. ""I think he's great entertainment and we love to listen to what he has to say."" ""I think the sport brings so many opportunities to women. I mean, it's brought me so many things into my life and my career. I don't regret any step that I have taken."" Gulbis was speaking after defeating Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic 6-3, 6-2, 7-5. He now advances to play Roger Federer in the fourth round after the Swiss overcame Dmitry Tursunov 7-5 6-7 (9/7) 6-2 6-4. Gulbis, who has risen to a career high world ranking of 17 thanks to a fine run of form this year, has never made the fourth round of a major before but admitted he was keen to make up for lost time. ""Until the last two years I would be consistent for say three months, then I got sick or went to Latvia and took stupid ten days off,"" he said. ""Now I'm jumping on the last train. I'm 25 so this is my last opportunity to be really successful."" Gulbis and Federer were joined in the fourth round later in the day by world No 2 Novak Djokovic who battled past Croatia's Marin Cillic 6-3 6-2 6-7 (7-2) 6-4. The Serb, who dropped a set against Cilic for only the third time in nine meetings, will now face home-favorite Jo Wilfred Tsonga for a place in the quarter finals. ""Physically I had to work very hard, because he was very aggressive, and I could expect that,"" Djokovic said of his opponent after the match. ""(But) In important moments I held my nerves and, you know, I'm very happy that I went through."" Elsewhere in the men's draw, John Isner overcame Tommy Robredo of Spain 7-6 (15-13) 7-6 (7-3) 6-7 (7-5) 7-5. The big-serving American will now meet Thomas Berdych in round four after the Czech beat Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut. Radwanska stunned . The women's draw witnessed yet another shock Friday as third-seed Agnieszka Radwanska lost to unseeded Croat Ajla Tomljanovic. The Pole went down 6-4 6-4 in the first game of the day on Philippe Chatrier and follows top seeds Serena Williams and Li Na in making an unexpected an early exit at Roland Garros. ""After seeing the two first seeds go out, (I) feel like I can do this too. I grew up with these girls that are beating them... obviously, you respect everyone, but you don't fear anyone,"" Tomljanovic told reporters. The highest ranking player left in the ladies competition is now fourt seed Simona Halep of Romania who doesn't play her third round match against Maria-Teresa Torro-Flor until Saturday. Elsewhere on Friday, Angelique Kerber of Germany beat Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova 7-5, 6-3 and will now face 18th seed Eugenie Bouchard of Canada for a place in the quarters. Meanwhile, Samantha Stosur overcame Dominika Cibulkova 6-4, 6-4 to set up a fourth round tie with Maria Sharapova.","Ernests Gulbis says female tennis players need to think about kids when considering career .

"(CNN) -- The African National Congress has won South Africa's general election, holding on to power despite economic woes and corruption allegations that some felt might weaken its grip. Some 62.2% of votes cast went to the ANC, according to provisional results from the country's electoral commission as of Saturday morning. The Democratic Alliance placed a distant second with 22.2% of the vote, while four other parties split the rest. The millions of voters who participated in Wednesday's elections were charged with electing 400 members of Parliament, as well as representatives in new legislatures in South Africa's nine provinces, according to the South African Press Association. The electoral commission reported just over 73% turnout among the nation's 25 million registered voters. Earlier, South Africa's Government Communication and Information System called the elections ""a resounding success."" The result represents an expected victory for the party of Nelson Mandela, who died last December. But it's not necessarily a total one, considering that the ANC garnered a lower portion of the overall vote from the 65.9% it won in 2009. The ANC, which has governed for the past 20 years, still enjoys widespread support after the defeat of the apartheid system and the beginning of democracy in South Africa. But its popularity and that of President Jacob Zuma have been hit by various issues, including a scandal centered in Zuma's rural homestead in Nkandla, in the province of KwaZulu Natal. The state watchdog has alleged that more than $20 million of public money was misused in improvements to the sprawling complex. Zuma has denied any wrongdoing. CNN's Jethro Mullen, Robyn Curnow and Lonzo Cook contributed to this report.","NEW: Electoral commission reports just over 73% turnout .

"(CNN) -- The phrase ""small soy latte liberalism"" deserves to become the defining symbol of the failure of the Democratic Party. The Starbucks reference came from New York's new mayor, Bill de Blasio. As his party's putative presidential front-runner and her husband looked on, de Blasio put the incoherence of the modern left on full display in his inaugural address Wednesday. After a mayoral campaign which emphasized boldness, radicalism, populism and the ""new Progressive"" commitment to fighting income inequality, he revealed that after the rhetoric comes timidity, incoherence, and absurdity. Mayor de Blasio promised to change New York City for the daily price of a small soy latte from Starbucks. ""We will ask the very wealthy to pay a little more in taxes so that we can offer full-day universal pre-K and after-school programs for every middle school student,"" he said. ""And when we say 'a little more,' we can rightly emphasize the 'little.'"" ""Those earning between $500,000 and $1 million a year,"" the new mayor continued, ""...would see their taxes increase by an average of $973 a year. That's less than three bucks a day -- about the cost of a small soy latte at your local Starbucks."" It was sadly symbolic that Mayor de Blasio was speaking one week before the 50th anniversary of President Lyndon Johnson's declaration of a ""War on Poverty."" Look at the contrast between the mayor's reassurance about tiny sacrifices and Johnson's bold declaration in his State of the Union address on January 8, 1964. ""It will not be a short or easy struggle, no single weapon or strategy will suffice, but we shall not rest until that war is won,"" Johnson pledged. ""The richest nation on earth can afford to win it. We cannot afford to lose it."" Fifty years after the War on Poverty began, the boldest declaration our new champion of liberalism can muster is that his own expansion of the welfare bureaucracy will cost the New York elite no more than their daily dose of caffeine. Oh, how the price to ease their consciences has fallen in half a century. And yet the poor are still impoverished. Here are the facts: After 50 years and trillions of dollars, bureaucratic government has lost the war on poverty. Each year, we spend $17,000 per person in poverty on means-tested welfare programs alone, as Peter Ferrara points out. That adds up to more than $16 trillion since 1965. Yet today, left-wing leaders like Mayor de Blasio and President Barack Obama still call inequality ""the defining issue of our time."" What does this say about their welfare bureaucracies? Like Obama's small, recycled proposals to help poor Americans, de Blasio's ""small soy latte"" liberalism will grow bureaucracy and please bureaucratic unions but will not help win the war on poverty. Their minor tinkering with the current welfare state will clearly fail, just as it has failed for decades, and yet minor tinkering is all that the chiefs of modern liberalism have to offer. As if to reassure us, they pledge that continuing the charade will cost just a little more. Poor and disadvantaged Americans deserve a completely new approach to poverty -- one which has the courage to analyze the failures of the past 50 years. A focus on incentives, economic growth, and on helping the least well-off learn the skills they need to leave poverty would be a good start. Poor Americans need a fundamental break from a system which has trapped so many in dependency. Ironically, de Blasio has done us all a favor by being so clear about the small, timid, and ultimately hopeless efforts to use big bureaucracies to solve the real problems of impoverished Americans. Let's say no to ""small soy latte liberalism"" and yes to profoundly rethinking the best way of helping our fellow citizens. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of Newt Gingrich.","NYC mayor proposes slight tax hike on high earners to fund pre-school .

"Shanghai (CNN) -- With its expansive steel skin, tall parasol-shaped concrete pillars, and huge vestigial coal hoppers, the 33,000-square-meter Long Museum West Bund makes a grand impression in a former industrial site beside Shanghai's Huangpu River. Launched at the end of March, the museum is the second and the largest private institution established by prominent Chinese art collectors Wang Wei and her husband Liu Yiqian. It has the potential to become Shanghai's equivalent of a Guggenheim or a Whitney. Yet as significant as it may someday be, the Long Museum is a mere spark in the explosion of China's ongoing museum boom. In 2010, the National People's Congress outlined a five-year plan that, among other things, aimed to see China's high-speed railway network reach 45,000 km and its number of museums increase to 3,500 nationwide. The idea that culture can be laid like train tracks may be moot, but there's no question that this cultural infrastructure is being rapidly developed. By the end of 2013, two years before deadline, China already exceeded its goal, tallying a total of 4,000 museums. ""Museumification"" Museum experts observe that China's strategy is focused on building new museums, while the problem of setting up quality exhibition programs and finding an audience is dealt with later. For the first phase of that strategy, the country is still in its early stages. ""China plans to elevate the per-capita number of museums to equal international levels. The short-term goal is to have one museum per 250,000 people,"" says Jeffrey Johnson, director of Columbia University's China Megacities Lab. Johnson calls this aggressive proliferation of institutions the ""museumification"" of China. It is an aggressive plan to fast-forward the development of the cultural sphere. The UK counted 3.12 museums per 100,000 people in 2011, but this number took more than a century to achieve. One reason China is exceeding its museum building goals is that, in addition to state-run institutions, many new museums are being built to service corporate and private interests. Property giants Times Property, Rockbund, and OCT have all built art museums to garner interest in their real estate developments. Shanghai's Tobacco Museum provides propaganda in favor of smoking, while the Museum of Glass, widely celebrated for its design, was built so the owners could develop the land while satisfying a legal requirement that they continue to use the land in an industry-related way. Nationwide craze . China's new museums aren't all concentrated on the country's prosperous east coast. ""The good quality museums are pretty well spread out, even in remote places,"" says Clare Jacobson, author of New Museums in China. ""If you have an archaeological site in nowhere northern China you're going to build a museum on top of it to protect that site."" ""Ordos (Inner Mongolia), where they're trying to set up a new town, actually has two museums that are used as focal points in the urban planning of that city, much like a church or town hall would be used in the West."" From an architectural perspective, Jacobson is enthusiastic about the quality of many of China's new museums. She cites the Museum of Handcraft Paper -- ""a beautiful little project right on the Burmese border"" -- as particularly impressive, as well as the Norman Foster-designed Datong Art Museum in Shanxi Province. ""Datong is not completely third-tier or anything but it's not Beijing or Shanghai, so for Foster to be building a huge museum there, for me, is something,"" says Jacobsen. Money matters . Monumental government institutions, such as the China Art Palace, occupy some of the country's most impressive buildings, but successful museums provide more than just awesome architecture. Jacobson cites private art museums such as the Rockbund in Shanghai and the Times Museum in Guangzhou as institutions that have not only interesting architecture but also quality exhibitions and strong events programs. Viewed holistically, Jacobson says, ""a lot of the successes are private museums rather than the state-run museums."" Li Xu, the Deputy Director of the state-run Power Station of Art (PSA) museum, says: ""The government is still in the process of developing a system for supporting established museums."" Li helps to run the 41,000-square-meter mega museum, often likened to another converted power station, the Tate Modern in London. It has no collection of its own, an annual budget of just RMB 20 million, and fewer than 10 staff to arrange exhibitions. ""Compared to public museum budgets in developed Western countries, our exhibition budget is very low,"" Li says. The Tate's total income for 2012-2013 was nearly Â£158 million. That kind of big budget is able to draw in big crowds, such as the 4.8 million visitors in 2013. In Shanghai, the PSA received 380,000 visitors in that same year, a modest number for a city as large as Shanghai. While the PSA is a young institution, having only opened in 2012. The activity of museum going itself remains relatively new in China, and these factors only emphasize the need for bigger budgets, better exhibition design and more effective outreach programs to build and educate a new audience. ""I think necessarily in the development of China the 'hardware' comes before the 'software,'"" says Jacobson. ""It just does. There are models of that in industry and in housing."" She believes that museums here are often vanity projects, generating spectacular architecture but vast quantities of underutilized space. For the moment, she thinks China lacks enough experienced curators, researchers and museum directors, but that this is changing. ""There continue to be more university-level programs established in China offering museum and curatorial studies, and more and more Chinese students (are traveling) abroad for education in internationally established programs,"" says Jacobson. Architectural legacy . The danger of building a vast infrastructure network of any kind in anticipation of demand is that the demand doesn't always arrive. There's been notable unevenness in many areas of China's growth, with forests of apartment blocks and entire speculative cities lying empty. With many new museums devoid of visitors, the same could happen in the cultural sphere. The China Megacities Lab research project is watching to see how museums in China might evolve. ""Are there new rolesâ€”socially, culturally, politicallyâ€”that the museum is playing? What new architectural forms and spatial organizations are being invented to accommodate these new ambitions?"" Johnson asks. And if museums in China do evolve into wholly different forms, what will happen to the buildings being built? Clare Jacobson says the new architecture is worthwhile, regardless of the 'museum' label. ""Actually you do need a few places of beauty within this vast array of residential towers and boring office buildings. And I think the quality of a lot of these museums is just stunning, from both international architects and local architects. I think those buildings will remain -- whether they're used as museums or not is a different question. The buildings themselves will be important for a long time.""","China counts 4,000 museums at the end of 2013, meeting its five-year goal two years early .
New museums promote culture but are also used for corporate branding and for anchoring China's new cities .
What will become of these architectural wonders if the museums fail to attract visitors?"
"(CNN) -- Five Somali men were convicted in the Netherlands of plotting a hijack at sea and sentenced to five years in prison, CNN affiliate RTL reported Thursday. The trial of the five, said to be the first trial of pirates in Europe in modern times, opened in Rotterdam District Court May 25. The men were captured by the Danish navy in January 2009 in the Gulf of Aden, off Somalia, after a cargo ship with a Dutch Antilles flag was attacked, said Wim de Bruin, a spokesman for the Netherlands National Prosecutor's Office. ""The ship of the pirates was destroyed by the Danish navy, and the pirates were captured and handed to the Dutch authorities,"" he said. The pirates are Ahmed Yusuf Farah, 25, Jama Mohamed Samatar, 45, Abdirisaq Abdulahi Hirsi, 33, Sayid Ali Garaar, 39, and Osman Musse Farah, 32, de Bruin said. They had faced a maximum sentence of nine to 12 years, he added. Another suspected Somali pirate is awaiting sentencing in the United States, where he pleaded guilty in May to hijacking and kidnapping. Prosecutors say Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse led an attack on a U.S.-flagged vessel, the Maersk Alabama, off the coast of Africa last year. He pleaded guilty May 19 in a New York federal court to felony counts of hijacking maritime vessels, kidnapping and hostage taking for his role in the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama in the Indian Ocean on April 8, 2009. Muse faces a maximum sentence of almost 34 years behind bars when he is sentenced October 19. The pirates who were tried in the Netherlands spent four weeks aboard the Danish navy ship after their capture before being taken to the Netherlands, spokesman de Bruin said. They were held in pre-trial custody while the court interviewed witnesses from the Danish navy and seamen on the Dutch Antilles cargo ship that was under attack, he said. Five Dutch defense lawyers represented the suspects, de Bruin said. The trial is the first of its kind in Europe, he said. Germany will soon try 10 suspected pirates who were captured in the Gulf of Aden earlier this year. They were arrested after their attempt to board a German cargo vessel, but the Danish navy ended the hijacking and handed them over to the Dutch authorities, Bruin said. They have since been held in the Netherlands, and Germany requested their extradition about two months ago. CNN's Richard Allen Greene and Eileen Hsieh contributed to this report.","Five Somali men convicted in Netherlands court .

"(CNN) -- Ariel Castro agreed Friday in an Ohio courtroom to a plea deal in one of the most sensational kidnapping cases in recent memory. The deal, reached with prosecutors, would let him avoid the possibility of a death sentence and spare his victims from having to testify at a trial. The plea deal recommends that he be sentenced to life in prison without parole -- that he never get a parole hearing. It would also mean that a trial Castro was facing on August 5 would not happen and he would not face the possibility of being sentenced to death. Judge Michael J. Russo went over the deal with Castro, and told him that he would be labeled as a sexual predator. Castro replied that he understood. At one point, he interjected that he was ""also a victim as a child"" to which Russo responded that he could make whatever statement he wanted during the sentencing hearing. Russo also said that victims would be notified of the hearing and also would then have a chance to say what they liked. Russo went through charges Castro faces relating to the allegations he held three women captive for a decade and asked him how he pleaded. Over and over, Castro replied: ""Guilty."" At another moment in the hearing, which lasted well over an hour, the judge asked Castro how good his English is. Castro replied that he is good at spelling and reading but his comprehension is bad because ""my addiction to pornography and my sexual problem has really taken a toll on my mind."" Timeline: Three Cleveland girls go missing . An attorney for three women had told CNN that they were hoping for a plea deal because they did not want to take the stand at Castro's trial. A law firm representing Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus, issued a statement after Castro agreed to a plea. ""Amanda, Gina, and Michelle are relieved by today's plea,"" according to Jones Day. ""They are satisfied by this resolution to the case, and are looking forward to having these legal proceedings draw to a final close in the near future."" The women want to remain private and don't want to speak to media or others, the statement said, but they're grateful for the support they've received from family and friends and the Cleveland Courage Fund, which has helped raise money for them. With help, women freed . Castro's defense attorneys had previously said they wanted a deal that would take capital punishment out of the equation. Castro was charged with 977 counts, including aggravated murder on suspicion of ending the pregnancy of one of his captives. Under the deal, he agreed to plead guilty to 937 counts. Russo told Castro that the deal would mean he would go to prison for life, plus at least 1,000 years. Earlier this month, the former bus driver had pleaded not guilty to the 977 charges. He was being held on $8 million bail. At the close of Friday's hearing, Russo remanded Castro back into custody, and set a sentencing date for August 1. Castro abducted Knight, Berry and DeJesus separately in a two-year period starting in 2002, according to authorities. Snapshots: Who are the three women? The women and Berry's 6-year-old daughter -- DNA tests have confirmed that Castro is the child's father -- were freed in May after one of the women shouted for help while Castro was away from his 1,400-square-foot home. The cries for help were heard by neighbor Charles Ramsey, who was sitting down to eat. Read more: Charles Ramsey: I'm no hero . ""I see this girl going nuts trying to get out of a house,"" he told CNN affiliate WEWS. ""I go on the porch and she says, 'help me get out. I've been in here a long time.'""

""I've been kidnapped, and I've been missing for 10 years. And I'm here, I'm free now."" Under the plea deal, the house where the women were confined will be demolished, Russo said. Berry was last seen after finishing her shift at a Burger King in Cleveland in 2003. It was the eve of her 17th birthday. DeJesus disappeared nearly a year later, in April 2004. She was 14. Knight vanished in 2002, at age 21, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer newspaper. Read more: Freed women reunite with families . In early July, Berry, DeJesus and Knight released a YouTube video offering their thanks to all those who have helped them since they were freed.

"(CNN) -- These days, no fashion house portfolio is complete without a hotel -- or at the very least, a luxuriously designed suite. Tommy Hilfiger and Karl Lagerfeld are the latest fashion icons to try their hands at hoteling, with Hilfiger recently purchasing Miami's The Raleigh Hotel and Lagerfeld set to open his first branded property in Macau (albeit not until 2017). They join the ranks of many of the fashion industry's most iconic members, including Bulgari, Armani, Versace, and -- until recently -- Missoni (the Hotel Missoni brand, alas, is calling it quits). ""From a designer's perspective, a hotel gives you complete latitude to bring their way of thinking to everything, from the draperies to the textures and colors, that's what you sign up for,"" says Nikhil Bhalla, vice president of equity research in lodging at FBR Capital Markets. In many cases, a hotel acts as a sort of large-scale designer showroom. Armani Hotels, for instance, are outfitted with furnishings from Armani Home, ball gowns accentuate the décor at Milan's Maison Moschino, and no suite at Bulgari Hotel is complete without the brand's signature silver. ""Hotels are a great way to showcase the design identity of a brand, and to project a lifestyle that goes beyond products,"" notes Silvio Ursini, the executive vice president of Bulgari Hotels & Resorts. Or, as Bhalla puts it, ""the handbag experience has extended itself into a lifestyle experience."" Hotel brands are just as eager to align themselves with a fashion brand (even if they don't hand over the reins completely). When they're not tapping big-name designers to decorate their suites, hotels are conjuring up fashion-led experiences to entice customers, be it a Burberry trench coat-loan program or same-day delivery from Net-a-Porter. ""For the consumer, who probably already likes the brand, these experiences are an opportunity to experience it at a higher level; it helps them bond with brand a little bit more than they would have before,"" explains Bhalla. It also offers the customers a consistency that they might not otherwise expect from a hotel room. ""When a woman comes to us for a dress, she knows she's going to look gorgeous and glamorous -- that's what we do. When she stays in our suite, she'll know the same design levels went into making the space,"" notes James Mischka, half of the design label Badgley Mischka, which designed a 1,700-square foot suite at The Breakers Palm Beach. Branding a hotel suite with a fashion label also helps it attain an extra level of exclusivity. Bulgari Hotels, for instance, mimics the exclusivity of its design brand by limiting its room count. ""There's always a scarcity value attached to these types of offerings, and at no point does a brand want to dilute that,"" explains Bhalla.","Tommy Hilfiger and Karl Lagerfeld are the latest fashion icons to turn hotelier .
Lately, hotels and fashion houses are becoming more aligned .
Many hotels offer designer suites and experiences to bring in customers ."
"New Delhi (CNN) -- The father of the woman whose rape and fatal beating provoked outrage across India and worldwide says his daughter's death ""brought an awakening to society."" The 23-year-old student, whose name has not been released, died in a Singapore hospital in late December after being assaulted on a New Delhi bus on December 16. The case sparked protests in several Indian cities and led to promises to strengthen laws against sexual assault. Opinion: India's rape problem needs a rewiring of society's attitude . ""Society can no longer turn a blind eye to these sorts of incidents, which are happening every day,"" the woman's father told the British television network ITV. ""We have to change ourselves. If there are no changes, then these horrible things won't stop. The public has to wake up now."" The victim was a physiotherapy student who was expecting to start a hospital internship this month. Her father said she wanted to be a doctor ""right from the start,"" largely to help her family escape poverty. ""Her main aim was that our family would not have to suffer anymore,"" he said. ""She wanted to put the difficult life behind us. Why bow to our poverty? She also wanted to make sure that I didn't have to keep working hard late in life."" Five men were charged with murder, rape and kidnapping, and could be sentenced to death if convicted. A juvenile court will take up the matter of determining the age of a sixth suspect, who claims to be 17 and therefore not old enough to be tried as an adult. Read more: Lawyer urges not-guilty pleas in India rape case . The five adults appeared in court Monday, when a New Delhi judge ordered proceedings closed after tempers flared among lawyers inside the packed courtroom. The local bar association last week vowed not to represent any of the suspects because of the nature of the crime they are accused of committing. A male companion who had gone to the movies with the woman survived the attack with a broken leg. He later recounted that the bus driver made lewd remarks about the woman when they boarded, and five other men taunted the couple and locked the doors. Opinion: Indian rape debate: Why death penalty is no solution . Then the attack began, with the driver, wielding an iron bar, taking part, the man told the news agency Agence France-Presse. The badly beaten woman was flown to Singapore for treatment after the attack. Her father told ITV he was ""like a bird without wings"" as he accompanied his unconscious daughter, but ""I used to get filled with some hope."" ""When I was told that she might not get well and might have to get an operation, I felt uncomfortable. It was difficult for me,"" he said. ""But when she was put on a ventilator, it gave me some hope that she would get better. I thought she might get better and she would live."" Read more: New Delhi rape exposes the perils of being a woman in India . In some ways, Indian women have made great strides in the past few decades. Literacy rates have gone up and maternal mortality rates have gone down. Millions of women have joined the workforce, and political leaders like Congress Party chief Sonia Gandhi are role models. But the number of reported rapes -- in a country where a cultural stigma keeps many victims from reporting the crime -- has increased drastically, from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011, according to official figures. New Delhi alone had 572 rapes reported in 2011 and more than 600 in 2012. Most women in India have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation or on the streets, said Seema Sirohi, of the Indian Council on Global Relations. The slain student's father said he hoped any new law inspired by the attack -- or perhaps a hospital -- would bear his daughter's name. ""She has brought an awakening to society,"" he said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder Thursday ran into unexpected bipartisan opposition on Capitol Hill over the Justice Department's failure to release its report on the alleged misconduct of the prosecutors who mishandled the prosecution of the late Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens. Two Democrats and two Republicans jumped on Holder for not releasing the report by the Justice watchdog unit, the Office of Professional Responsibility. Holder said the report is essentially complete, and that he would support making most of the report public at the appropriate time, but said he is awaiting a separate report by an outside counsel hired by the federal judge who heard the Stevens trial. That report by independent attorney Henry Schuelke is expected to be released by trial judge Emmet Sullivan as early as March 15, although one of the prosecutors in the case is still fighting making that report public. Sens. Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland, and Diane Feinstein, D-California, joined Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchinson, R-Texas, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, in urging Holder to release the internal Justice report promptly. Mikulski, who chairs the Appropriations subcommittee where Holder testified on the Justice Department budget, said the report needs to be public. ""Regardless of the party in the White House we must have a Justice Department we believe in and the American people believe in,"" said Mikulski. Holder told Hutchison he believes five attorneys cited by the report are still employed by the Justice Department, and he would take action if necessary after the reports are released. A sixth attorney under investigation has since committed suicide. The lawyers were investigated for mishandling critical evidence in the case. Stevens was convicted of failing to disclose a gift from a contractor friend on required campaign financial forms while seeking re-election in 2008. He narrowly lost. He was killed months later in a private plane crash while on a fishing trip in Alaska. Feinstein called it a tragedy that Stevens died before he knew that he was convicted by a faulty prosecution.","2 Democrats, 2 Republicans jumped on AG for not releasing report on prosecution of senator .

"(CNN) -- For three months, Mark Cherry lay in a Chicago-area hospital room, close to death. He suffered a gunshot wound during a home invasion in Gary, Indiana -- a crime he is accused of committing, and in which he allegedly shot and killed a 22-year old man. In late February, fully recovered, Cherry discharged himself and walked out of the hospital. Now, the victim's family is questioning how an accused killer could just leave, with no one stopping him. Law enforcement and the hospital are blaming each other for the mix-up. And Cherry is still on the run. ""Why wasn't he handcuffed? Why didn't you have a police officer at the door waiting for him to get released?"" Lourdes deJesus Correa, mother of the victim, Rolando Correa, told CNN affiliate WLS Tuesday. The home invasion . Lourdes Correa's son was killed more than five months ago. Just before midnight on December 1, Cherry and two other men allegedly forced their way into a home where Rolando Correa was staying. At some point during the home invasion, shots were fired and Cherry allegedly shot and killed Rolando Correa, Gary Police spokeswoman Cpl. Gabrielle King told CNN. Cherry was also wounded and transported to a local hospital, and then airlifted across state lines to a hospital in Illinois, she said. That same month, Cherry was charged with murder, attempted murder, criminal confinement, and battery with a deadly weapon. At Advocate Christ Medical Center, Cherry recovered but was apparently not under police guard during his hospital stay. The hospital told CNN it can't hold a patient against their will, and that without prior written consent, can't alert another person of a patient's pending discharge. Privacy laws are in place to prevent that type of information from being shared, a hospital spokesman said. ""If a patient is under suspicion for a serious offense, the police department involved in the case typically posts an officer on site during the period of the hospitalization,"" the hospital said. Gary police say that they have no jurisdiction in Illinois, and that prevented them from having someone guarding Cherry. ""I don't know what a better scenario would be,"" King, the police spokeswoman, said, adding that ""we really don't know who is responsible"" for Cherry slipping through the cracks. Gary police could have asked the Cook County Sheriff's Office in Illinois to monitor the suspect. That wasn't done. ""Unfortunately, our investigators assumed because he was unconscious that the hospital would give the detective a call before he was released,"" Chief Wade Ingram told WLS. Police are searching for the murder suspect, though there are few clues other than he was discharged from the hospital, King said. It's an emotional blow for a family that's already lost so much. ""It's like our whole family is falling apart due to this. We are falling apart,"" Lourdes deJesus Correa said. ""Please, I just want justice for my son. For my family. That's all I want.""","NEW: ""We really don't know who is responsible"" for Cherry slipping away, police say .

"Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- A Ugandan gay rights activist whose name was published on a list of the nation's ""top homosexuals"" was bludgeoned to death in his home near the capital, his lawyer said Thursday. A neighbor found David Kato dead and notified authorities, according to the lawyer, John Onyango. Kato's money and some clothes were missing after the attack, Onyango said. It was unclear whether Kato's killing was linked to his gay rights activism or a front-page story in a Ugandan tabloid that reignited anti-gay sentiments late last year. The story included a list of ""top 100 homosexuals"" with their photos, addresses and a banner with the words ""Hang Them."" Kato's name and picture were on the list. Arrest warrants have been issued for two suspects: a taxi driver found near Kato's house and an ex-convict who was staying with Kato before the killing, Onyango said. Kato told CNN last year that he feared for his life after the list was released. His lawyer said he had informed authorities in Mukono, the town where he lived, of his fears. ""The villagers want to set my house ablaze,"" he told CNN at the time. ""They want to burn my house. ... (They say,) 'Can you go away before my house is burned?'"" Authorities in the Mukono criminal investigations department declined to comment pending further investigation. Activists decried the attack, and urged authorities in the east African nation to investigate the killing. They called on the government to protect them from violence, and act on threats and hostility toward them. ""David Kato's death is a tragic loss to the human rights community. David had faced the increased threats to Ugandan LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) people bravely and will be sorely missed,"" said Maria Burnett, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. U.S. President Barack Obama said he was saddened by the death of Kato, whom he called a ""powerful advocate for fairness and freedom."" ""At home and around the world, LGBT persons continue to be subjected to unconscionable bullying, discrimination, and hate,"" the president said in a written statement. ""In the weeks preceding David Kato's murder in Uganda, five members of the LGBT community in Honduras were also murdered. It is essential that the governments of Uganda and Honduras investigate these killings and hold the perpetrators accountable."" Earlier this year, Kato and two activists won a case against the magazine that published the list. The court ruled that media in Uganda are barred from releasing details of known or potential homosexuals in the country. The editor of the Rolling Stone, the tabloid that published the list, denounced the attacks and said he sympathized with the victim's family. ""When we called for hanging of gay people, we meant ... after they have gone through the legal process,"" said Giles Muhame. ""I did not call for them to be killed in cold blood like he was."" The Rolling Stone tabloid is not affiliated with the iconic U.S. music magazine by the same name. Homosexuality is illegal in most countries in Africa, where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism. In Uganda, homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life in prison, according to rights activists. The U.S. Mission in Kampala, Uganda, said, ""David's courageous devotion to promoting the universal human rights of members of Uganda's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community improved the lives of minority populations in Uganda and throughout Africa, and his selfless dedication to defending human rights and speaking out against injustice served as inspiration to human rights defenders around the world."" CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report.","NEW: President Obama says the activist was advocate for fairness and freedom .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Schoolchildren were ordered to halt outdoor sports activities until Tuesday this week, as a dirty cloud of smog continued to shroud China's capital. This was among a series of emergency response measures adopted in Beijing Sunday when the city's Air Quality Index exceeded 500 micrograms, the highest level. Anything above this is regarded as ""beyond index."" Reports of respiratory problems -- as well as the sale of masks -- have skyrocketed, according to state media, and over the weekend, streets appeared emptier, as a sun was barely visible amid a hazy blanket. On Monday morning the U.S. Embassy in Beijing recorded ""hazardous"" levels of pollution, with a ""Beyond Index"" reading of 515 at 3:00 a.m. (2 p.m. Sunday) local time, last seen on Saturday when the air quality index, based on U.S. national air quality standards, hit as high as 755. Read more: Which city has best quality of life? Beijing Hyundai Motor Company suspended production on Sunday, and nearly 30 construction sites halted construction, the China Daily cited the city's environmental protection bureau as saying. The city's residents say pollution is worsening despite authorities' assertions that air quality has improved since the city hosted the 2008 Olympic Games. Last year, heavy haze and smog forced the cancellation of almost 700 flights at Beijing airports. The city is comparable to Los Angeles, another gray city, according to experts. ""With their difficult meteorological conditions and a large number of pollution sources, addressing pollution is a long-term and difficult task,"" Deborah Seligsohn, adviser of the World Resources Institute, said last year. The agency runs a climate energy and pollution program in China. Los Angeles has battled air pollution since the 1950s, well before U.S. national regulation, according to Seligsohn. ""Stilll in the 1970s, 20 years later, it was famous for its smog,"" she said. ""In the 40-plus years since the Clean Air Act was passed, L.A. has never been fully in compliance with EPA standards, even though it has continued to improve.""

European Commission figures show that China produced 9.7 million kilotons of carbon dioxide while the United States had 5.42 million kilotons in 2011, the latest available numbers.

""Pollutants have gradually accumulated over the course of recent windless days, making the air quality even worse,"" said Zhu Tong, an environmental sciences professor at Peking University told news agency. Beijing will remain covered in gray until Wednesday, when the wind will sweep in to the rescue and blow the smog away, according to state media.

"(CNN) -- Deadly explosions ripped through two passenger buses in Nairobi, Kenya's capital, on Sunday, killing at least three people and injuring a number of others. Kenyan police reported three people were killed and seven injured in one bus explosion, but they have not yet confirmed the second blast. Police are treating the incident as a terrorist attack, but there were no immediate suspects, spokeswoman Zipporah Mboroki said Sunday. The Kenya National Disaster Operation Center confirmed explosions on two buses. The agency tweeted that two people were killed and 62 injured, including 20, who were in critical condition. Kenya's Interior Ministry reported that of the 20 people critically injured in the attacks, nine were women, six were men and five were children. The buses were on Thika Highway, one near the Safari Park Hotel, the other near the Homeland Inn, when the explosions occurred, according to a tweet from the NDOC. Pictures from the scene show the buses were still mostly intact, but the windows were blown out of both vehicles. One of the buses had a piece of its side missing and part of its front bumper. Kenyan police said they will have more information on the deadly attack at a news conference Monday. Tossed grenade in Mombasa kills at least three people . Four killed in blast in Nairobi suburb .

"(CNN) -- New details emerged Friday of the fatal gang rape of a 23-year-old student in New Delhi from a male friend, who detailed the incident as horrific and their subsequent treatment as callous. The 28-year-old man, who asked not to be identified, said he and the young woman had watched a movie December 16, and then boarded a private bus to return to her home in a New Delhi suburb. The driver made lewd remarks and five other men taunted the couple and locked the doors, he said in a telephone interview with Agence France-Presse from a town in Uttar Pradesh state. ""They hit me with a small stick and dragged my friend to a seat near the driver's cabin,"" the man said. Then the ""driver and the other men raped my friend and hit her in the worst possible ways in the most private parts of her body."" The driver used an iron bar in the attack, he told the news agency. The friend said he suffered a broken leg. ""The cruelty I saw should not be seen ever. I tried to fight against the men but later I begged them again and again to leave her,"" he said. In an interview with Reuters, the man said their abductors drove the couple throughout the city for about two hours before dropping them below an overpass; he was unable to stand and had no clothes. ""Three-wheeler taxis would slow down, take a look at us and move on,"" he said. ""So would cars and motorcycles. We got no help for nearly 20 or 25 minutes."" When three police vehicles finally did show up, he said, ""they couldn't decide among themselves which police precinct has jurisdiction."" Throughout, his friend was bleeding profusely, he said. ""We need change in every area,"" the companion said. The attack, which resulted in the woman's death on December 29, has prompted widespread debate over the way the country handles sexual assaults and the treatment of women in India. Numerous protests have taken place and laws have been proposed. India's interior minister has ordered New Delhi police stations to increase the number of women officers to facilitate the handling of complaints from women. Interior Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said Friday that each police station in Delhi should have 10 women constables and two women subinspectors. Indian rape debate: Why death penalty is no solution . ""We will be posting these women very soon, according to this order, by diverting staff from other places and making them available in Delhi,"" police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said. At present, women comprise 7% of police forces, he said. Candidates will be recruited within four months, and training will take an additional nine months, he said. Bhagat denied that the directive was issued solely because of the rape, but said it is aimed at helping women. Read more: The perils of being a woman in India . ""We need overall more women in the police station as other women feel more comfortable with female officers,"" he said. ""If all women complaints are attended to promptly, situations like that of the gang-raped medical student may have been avoided."" The interior minister said he is working with security officials to strengthen laws regarding rape and assault. In the state of Haryana, about 80 miles northwest of Delhi, officials plan to publicize the profiles of rapists. The state will publish the names, addresses and case numbers of convicted rapists on a website. ""In doing so, we hope to curb crime against women,"" said Laik Ram Dabbas, director of the state crime records bureau. The website could be active this month, Dabbas said. ""By making these names and profiles public, we think crime can be curbed, as in India people are sensitive to public embarrassment,"" Dabbas said. ""Once the public is aware of such people roaming around their area, they will become more careful.""

"(CNN) -- Eastern North Carolina cleaned up Saturday from powerful tornadoes that damaged about 200 homes and knocked out power to thousands of customers. Meanwhile, much of the central United States is bracing for even more severe weather in the form of tornadoes, damaging winds and hail. Multiple twisters touched down in an area east of Greenville, North Carolina, to Beaufort County, on Friday evening, the National Weather Service reported. A tornado that struck Whichards Beach in Beaufort County injured 16 people and damaged or destroyed 150-200 homes, reported the Pasquotank-Camden Emergency Management, quoting the National Weather Service. The twister was rated an EF-3, with winds estimated at 150 mph. Emergency management official said that ended the streak of days without an EF-3 tornado at 158 days. John Pack, spokesman for the Beaufort County Emergency Management, estimated more than 200 homes in that county sustained major damage, and at one point at least 2,500 homes didn't have power. He told CNN that staffers at the National Weather Service, county volunteer fire crews and more than 100 electrical crews were working to assist residents. In Pasquotank County, three tornadoes touched down, destroying 13 homes and causing major damage to 17 homes, the Pasquotank-Camden Emergency Management said. The weather service said those were EF-2 and EF-1 twisters. NC Dominion Power reported 3,100 customers losing power in Pasquotank County. Elizabeth City Public Utilities said approximately 4,000 city customers lost power. In nearby Perquimans County, the story was similar. A spokesman for that county's emergency management agency, Tom Ponte, told CNN a preliminary assessment showed the storm damaged 38 homes and left about 1,770 residents without power. According to Ponte, the county is opening a shelter for residents displaced by the storm and roads are being cleared by the county fire department, with assistance from the North Carolina Department of Forestry. The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center, which monitors severe weather across the United States, said severe weather will move over other parts of the United States over the next three days. That's all due to a storm that's moving eastward from the Rockies. CNN meteorologist Matt Daniels predicts a slight risk of severe storms Saturday evening from central Texas into southeast South Dakota. This may include damaging winds and large hail, but does not rule out a few tornadoes. On Sunday, most of Arkansas and neighboring areas -- including Shreveport, Louisiana, and Springfield, Missouri -- face the highest chance of severe weather, though states as far north as North Dakota, and southeast to Georgia, also could be in harm's way. The SPC said it may upgrade Sunday's threat level from moderate to ""high risk."" This would be the first ""high risk"" threat this year -- a warning that is typically issued only a few times a year. The danger zone shifts farther east on Monday, with Memphis, Tennessee, and Tupelo, Mississippi, among the cities most likely to get hit. There is also a slight risk of storms stretching into the Midwest, north Georgia and the western Carolinas. These storms could produce damaging winds, large hail and tornadoes (some could be strong) throughout the day. And yet more severe weather looms for Tuesday. The Storm Prediction Center notes that these threats come in a year that has been -- so far -- one of the quietest for tornadoes in U.S. history. Already, the country has set a record for going the longest into a new year without a tornado fatality. CNN's Ralph Ellis, Dave Hennen, Suzanne Presto, John Branch and Stephen Daniel contributed to this story.","Tornadoes rip eastern North Carolina .

"(CNN) -- The Christmas Day airline terror alert has brought focus on PETN, a substance till now largely unknown to the public. The white powder is said to be central to the alleged plot by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab to bring down a passenger aircraft, carrying 300 passengers, as it prepared to land in Detroit. But just what is PETN? What does PETN look like? Pentaerythritol tetranitrate, to give it its full name, is a fine white powder that resembles sugar or salt. It does not compress down very well. How easy is to obtain? The core chemical in PETN is hard to make or get your hands on. How volatile is PETN? Not very. Although it is an explosive, you have to hammer it or ignite it to make it go off. And since it is not volatile, it is perfect for a terrorist on a long haul flight. As Sidney Alford, a UK explosives expert, explained to CNN's senior international correspondent Nic Robertson: ""It wouldn't go off accidentally. If I was carrying a pocketful of just neat powder in my pocket, it blowing up would be the last of my worries."" How much PETN did alleged bomber AbdulMutallab possess? Sources familiar with the investigation tell CNN the working assumption is that AbdulMutallab may have had some 80 grams of PETN. Alford says that this would be enough to blow a hole in an aircraft. What will PETN do when ignited? Alford conducted a controlled explosion of a sample of PETN for CNN. Six grams of PETN -- less than a tenth of what AbdulMutallab is alleged to have had in his possession -- punched a large circular dent into a metal plate twice the thickness of an aircraft fuselage. Alford said that he would usually expect six grams to punch a hole through the plate. He said it failed to happen on this occasion because half of the PETN burnt off before the explosion itself; also thick ice under the plate would have softened the impact of the blast. AbdulMutallab is said to have had much more than six grams. But, it is alleged, he didn't have the expertise to detonate it. How easy is PETN to conceal? CNN understands that alleged bomber AbdulMutallab was wearing explosives in the groin area. The appearance of PETN makes it easy to imagine how it can be stitched into clothing hidden around the body. Alford says that it is possible to sew PETN into a set of underpants. ""I've done it,"" he says, ""no problem at all.""  He also added: ""A great potential advantage of powdered PETN is that it could look like a wide range of substances or be disguised as even more -- whereas plastic explosives do look suspiciously like plastic explosives."" Given its appearance and ability to be concealed, PETN is a challenge for airport security officials to detect through usual means such as a metal detector. A statement attributed to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, dated Saturday and published Monday on radical Islamist Web sites, claimed responsibility for the attempted terrorist attack. It said it tested ""new kind of explosives"" in the alleged plot and hailed the fact that the explosives ""passed through security."" ""There was a technical problem that resulted in a non-complete explosion,"" the message said. Why did the PETN that AbdulMutallab allegedly possessed fail to explode? Alford believes the only reason lives were spared this time is because the alleged bomber's lack of training meant he couldn't detonate the bomb. That means he probably did not make it. As Alford explains: ""On the one hand he's been given a high value substance. On the other hand he's been left to his own efforts. ""I would expect someone knowledgeable and disciplined enough to make PETN would have been equally careful and assiduous in his means of initiating it."" CNN's Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","PETN is a white powder which is hard to ignite but easy to conceal .

"(CNN) -- Malaysian officials coordinating the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have been battered by criticism that they have mishandled the investigation into the plane's fate and the public response to the crisis. Here's a look at some of the notable issues raised by critics: . Malaysian military radar captured signatures of a plane that is believed to have been Flight 370, but it wasn't immediately noticed. The radar signatures offered evidence that the flight had turned west after its last contact with air traffic controllers, and that contact was lost over the Strait of Malacca. But radar operators did not see it in real time, meaning an opportunity to track the plane while it was in flight may have been lost. While the radar data was the key reason for expanding the search west of Malaysia, it took officials until March 11 -- three days after the disappearance -- to explain why they were looking so far off the plane's expected course. All the while, search efforts continued in places where data showed it could not have been -- the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea. Early briefings seemed chaotic; it was unclear who was in charge. ""Well, I think they didn't have a proper plan in place for such an accident like this,"" aviation analyst Alastair Rosenschein told CNN's Isa Soares. ""They were speaking off the hymn sheet, if you like, and they were making things up as they went along. And they said things, and then they withdrew them without actually saying they withdrew them."" Early on, an official inaccurately described two men traveling on stolen passports as resembling a black Italian soccer player. ""Do you know of a footballer by the name of Batolli?"" Malaysian Civil Aviation Director Azharuddin Abdul Rahman asked reporters at an early briefing. ""He's an Italian. Do you know how he looks like? Battoli, Battoli, Balloteli, Balloteli."" He was trying, in a roundabout way, to say the men were black, like Italian soccer player Mario Ballotelli. The men turned out to be Iranians seeking asylum, according to investigators. They are not believed to have had any links to terror. From ""none of those on board survived"" to ""hoping against hope"" On March 24, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said the plane's flight had ""ended"" in the southern Indian Ocean. Not long before that, Malaysia Airlines sent a text messages to some relatives, telling them that ""beyond any reasonable doubt ... none of those on board survived."" But on Saturday -- after family members had angrily blasted the conclusion as premature and lacking hard evidence -- acting Minister of Transport Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters that he had not entirely given up hope of finding survivors. ""Even hoping against hope, no matter how remote, of course, we are praying and we will continue our search for the possible survivors,"" he said. On Monday, Hishammuddin further seemed to further walk back the account offered by the government-owned airline, noting Najib's carefully worded statement that did not mention a crash or a lack of survivors. A glaring error emerges in the last words from the cockpit . On March 17, Malaysian authorities publicly confirmed the final words from the cockpit as ""all right, good night."" The innocuous bit of radio banter became yet another headache for investigators when, after days of prodding from reporters and family members, they released a transcript showing the final words were actually, ""Good night Malaysian three seven zero."" It's not that the new language was suspect -- it's not. It's that Malaysian officials got the original wording wrong, let it stand for nearly two weeks, and then -- after saying they wouldn't release the transcript because of its role in the investigation -- suddenly reversed course. ""Now it's just one thing, one day it's the next. It's truly kind of an amazing roller coaster ride,"" said CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo. ""That would be bad enough just for a civil aviation investigation and a criminal investigation, according to Malaysia. But there are 239 families involved. So high criticism is in order at this point."" She says the shifts call the investigation's credibility into question. Confusion over who spoke those words . Initially, officials indicated that it appeared it was co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid who was speaking to controllers. But on Monday, they seemed to waver on that claim. Previously, Malaysia Airlines had stated initial investigations indicated that the voice which signed off was that of the co-pilot,"" Hishammuddin said in a written statement. ""The police are working to confirm this belief, and forensic examination of the actual recording is ongoing."" Switching search zones delayed . On Friday, the search area in the Indian Ocean suddenly shifted more than 600 miles northeast after authorities announced further refinement of radar and satellite data had showed the plane couldn't have flown as far south as previously thought. But the Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous people familiar with the matter, reported Monday night that ""lapses in coordination among countries and companies"" led to a three-day delay in making that move. What happened? Andy Pasztor, one of the reporters who wrote the story, said it boiled down to poor coordination between two parts of the investigation: One dealt with satellite data, and the other with fuel consumption and aircraft performance. ""And so what we're left with is sort of a three-day gap where it's clear that folks were definitely looking in the wrong place,"" he said. The tools used in the search .

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- Is it time for underwater search vehicles to start scanning the ocean floor in the hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370? Some analysts say it is, because it's been days since anyone has picked up a possible signal from the missing aircraft's data recorders. And the batteries powering the locator beacons inside the so-called black boxes are probably dead, a top official from the company that manufactures the beacons told CNN on Sunday. That means searchers may not be able to detect any more pings to help lead them to those pieces of the missing plane. Meanwhile, the search area for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 grew over the weekend. And authorities say no one onboard the plane has been ruled out in connection with its disappearance. Sound familiar? Don't worry, it's not just you. More than five weeks into the search for the missing plane, in some ways, investigators seem to be back at square one, or at the very least, nowhere near solving the mystery. So should investigators stop listening for pings and start using new tools to scan the bottom of the ocean? That's the logical next step, analysts told CNN. And some argue that it's time to take it. ""Every good effort has been expended, but it's now looking like the batteries are failing, and it's time to start mowing the lawn, as we say, time to start scanning the sea floor,"" said Rob McCollum, a CNN analyst and ocean search specialist. Others said it's worth the time to keep listening for pings -- just in case. ""Any more information that they can glean over the next couple days could save weeks in the other phase of the search. A little investment now may save a lot of time later,"" said Van Gurley, a retired Navy oceanographer. Any data authorities can get to help narrow the search zone could have a major impact, he said. On Sunday, investigators increased the search area. Is that a bad sign? Not necessarily, said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. ""What I think they're doing is giving one last final push, a last-ditch effort if you will, to see if by any chance there is any wreckage to be found,"" she said. ""Because even a few pieces would help narrow the search. I think it's one last big push. Maybe just a Hail Mary pass to try and find anything that they can to help them zero in on where to go on the ocean floor."" The search area has shifted each day as officials look at new data and study the ocean currents. Still, no debris has been found, and promising audio signals heard days ago were far apart. On Monday, 12 aircraft and 15 ships were set to participate in the search for the missing plane in an 18,400-square-mile (47,600-square-kilomter) area. That swath of the Indian Ocean is smaller than the area crews searched on Sunday, but larger than the areas searchers focused on at the end of last week. Searchers are still listening for the sound of underwater pings, Australia's Joint Agency Coordination Centre said, even though no sounds have been picked up in the past 24 hours. Batteries 'most likely' dead . The plane carrying 239 people vanished from radar screens early March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The batteries that power the beacons attached to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370's black boxes are ""most likely"" dead or almost depleted, an official with the company that designs and builds the pingers told CNN on Sunday. ""More than likely they are reaching end of life or already have. We're at Day 37. ... If (a beacon) is still going, it is very, very quiet at this point,"" Jeff Densmore told CNN's ""State of the Union with Candy Crowley."" Densmore, director of engineering for Dukane Seacom, said his company has been helping search officials interpret the data from recent audio signals in the southern Indian Ocean, where the plane is thought to have been when it reached the end of its fuel supply. The signals were definitely man-made, he said, but there is no way to be 100% sure they came from the flight data recorder in the tail of the plane or the cockpit voice recorder until wreckage or the so-called black boxes are found on the ocean floor. The batteries that send out the signals were certified to last 30 days, a deadline that's already passed. ""We are in a transition period at the moment,"" retired Lt. Col. Michael Kay of the Royal Air Force told CNN, referring to the fact that searchers will soon have to give up hunting with pinger locators and switch to sonar. ""We know that the (data recorder) batteries last between 30 and 40 days."" Once searchers conclude there is no hope that the batteries could still power the beacons, they will lower the Bluefin-21, an unmanned underwater vehicle that uses sonar to scour the ocean floor, U.S. Navy Cmdr. William Marks said. Black boxes are vital to determine cause . A top Malaysian official on Sunday reaffirmed the importance of finding the black boxes from the Boeing 777 if the mystery of the missing airliner is ultimately to be solved. For instance, it would be difficult for investigators to clear crew or passengers until the two recorders are located, Malaysia's acting transport minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, said at a news conference in Kuala Lumpur. The inspector general of police has found nothing suspicious about the passenger manifest, Hishammuddin said, but ""he did not say that they all had been cleared on the four issues that the police are still investigating, which is the possible hijacking, issues of terrorism, psychological and personal problems. ""That is an ongoing thing, and I don't think the IGP would have meant that they have all been cleared, because unless we find more information, specifically on data in the black box, I don't think any chief of police would be in the position"" to declare the cases cleared, he said. Odd paths pings can take underwater . Living in limbo . Four pings, one dud . On April 5, the towed pinger locator detected two sets of underwater pulses of a frequency close to that used by the locator beacons. Three days later, on Tuesday, it reacquired the signals twice. All four signals were within 17 miles of one another. A fifth ping, detected Thursday by a sonobuoy dropped from an airplane, is ""unlikely to be related to the aircraft black boxes,"" Australian chief search coordinator Angus Houston said a day later.

"(CNN) -- The weeks have passed and, in most cases, their nerves have calmed. What began as shock, that they were almost victims of an in-flight terrorist attack, has morphed for many into contemplation. There are those who are still talking about what happened to them on Christmas Day, and there are others who are determined to put the incident behind them. The passengers of Northwest Flight 253 may have been one faulty explosive away from disaster. The suspect in that incident, Nigerian-born Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, 23, pleaded not guilty in January to six federal terrorism charges. And he has been talking to authorities, thanks to help from his own family members. But what if the passengers could be part of that conversation? What would they want to know or say to AbdulMutallab, the government, the world? CNN reached out by phone and e-mail to find out. More than anything, if they could sit down with AbdulMutallab they would simply ask: Why? How did a young man who grew up with privilege, education and exposure to the greater world end up accused of attempting a terrorist attack? ""For me, these are the burning questions,"" said Roey Rosenblith, 27, who co-founded Village Energy, a company in Uganda that hopes to help bring solar electricity to the 80 percent of Africans who have no electrical power. ""I've never had someone try to murder me, much less someone I didn't even know. So I'm very interested in finding out more about [his] motives so that we might possibly figure out how to avert others from traveling down the same path."" Could the fact that AbdulMutallab is talking to officials signal he has regret, Rosenblith wonders. If not, if he is a ""lost cause,"" Rosenblith said he wouldn't care to waste breath speaking to him. ""I don't spend a lot of time seeking out conversations with Holocaust deniers, Islamic fundamentalists or religious fanatics of any stripe,"" he said. ""I guess I've decided that people that are beyond the pale of reason are simply that and nothing I say will convince them otherwise."" Melinda Dennis, 31, was sitting about an arm's length from AbdulMutallab when he was taken up to first class after the incident. She stared at him, and his blank expression. Now she says she'd rather speak to others considering the path he is accused of taking. ""No matter what nationality we are or religion we choose, we are still people. I am a human being, a person that faces each day trying to make myself better and enrich the lives of people who know me,"" said Dennis, who's lived the past year-and-a-half in Rotterdam, Netherlands, where she works as a manufacturing project manager. ""Whether I live or die should not be decided on the whim of a person that wishes to brand all Americans as evil people. I am not defined by my nationality, but I believe in the goodness that resides in the people of every country."" Not everyone would let AbdulMutallab get away without hearing from them. If she could speak to him, Lori Haskell, a 32-year-old attorney in Michigan, would give him an earful. ""You attempted to kill my husband and I, as well as 300 other individuals, and you don't care at all,"" are some of the words she said she'd share. ""You have taken away my carefree attitude about flying and have made me terrified to fly anyplace ever again. I don't say this word much, because I don't like it, but I completely and totally hate you and what you did to my family. I never believed in the death penalty until I saw you try to blow me up."" Her anger is directed, too, at government authorities who she and others feel let them down. In the weeks that have followed the Christmas Day incident, further information has come to light about what officials knew or should have known before AbdulMutallab set foot on the airplane. AbdulMutallab's father had met with U.S. Embassy officials and with the CIA to discuss concerns about his son. U.S. intelligence reportedly knew about ""The Nigerian"" who had ties to Yemen, and they even had a partial name of ""Umar Farouk."" Customs and Border Protection officers say he was on a list of people who should be questioned when entering the U.S. They planned to talk to him once the aircraft landed in Detroit. But before they could do that, authorities say AbdulMutallab attempted to ignite an explosive device hidden in his underwear. ""I would ask [officials] to not get complacent ... just because we didn't die,"" Dennis said. ""We were lucky, pure and simple."" Added Mirco Lammerts, of the Netherlands, a 46-year-old father who was traveling with his wife and two teens: ""Why were we forced to stay on the plane while they knew there might be a risk of another bomb on board? Why were we being held like cattle for almost seven hours without any information at all?"" His concern may be fueled by the helplessness he felt after his 13-year-old daughter, seated directly behind AbdulMutallab, leapt into his lap and grew hysterical. No one knew, when the flight landed, that there were no other explosives on board, and for this reason, Patricia ""Scotti"" Keepman echoed similar concerns: ""Why did you allow the passengers to remain on the plane until you removed AbdulMutallab? Why were we not your first priority?"" Keepman, 51, her husband and grown daughter were making their way home to Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, with two new family additions in tow -- a boy and girl they'd just adopted from Ethiopia. After the incident on the plane, as it descended into Detroit, the family found comfort in their religious beliefs, joining hands and singing ""Jesus Loves Me."" In the aftermath, they still draw on their faith. ""Do not let people in this world filled with hatred stop you from experiencing everything this world has to offer. God is in control in the end, so you need not fear what 'might' happen, but rest in knowing that you are in his hands,"" she said, as a warning to others whose lives may be touched by terrorists. Some people like Beau Taylor, who at 35 has dedicated his professional life to economic and rural development in places that have included Iraq, don't even want to think about this incident anymore. ""I have put the experience behind me,"" said Taylor, who has witnessed up close the destruction of bombs, ""and do not wish to revisit it at this point."" But at least one passenger, who said he remains ""tormented"" by the experience and ""disappointed"" in the government, wants not only to keep revisiting it but to get the passengers recognition for surviving it. Alain Ghonda, a 38-year-old real estate developer who lives in Silver Spring, Maryland, would like passengers to sign a petition so that they may all be honored by President Obama, the state of Michigan, Northwest Airlines and its parent company Delta Air Lines. He is convinced that it is because of the passengers -- ""We were all heroes,"" he said recently -- that Flight 253 didn't become the next 9/11. ""Would we have been dead,"" he said, ""our spouses and children would have been guests at the White House and Congress, receiving medals and American flags."" This kind of thinking bothers Lammerts, who fired off a response to Ghonda's request, saying, ""It does not matter who did or did not do anything. Fact of the matter is that we would not have been able to do anything at all if the igniter would have functioned properly. ... We are victims of a failed terrorist attack."" Lammerts said he and his family ""are getting on with our lives and are just extra grateful for being alive,"" and he told Ghonda, ""I recommend you try and do the same. Live your life to the fullest."" That's a message that Rosenblith, who is back in Kampala, Uganda, carries with him, too. ""Though this might sound strange, for me personally almost getting killed 30,000 feet above the earth by an al Qaeda terrorist has been one of the best things that's ever happened to me,"" he said. ""Now being alive, seeing the blue sky, hearing the rain fall, eating a delicious meal, drinking a beer with a friend -- everyday stuff just feels like an amazing gift. ... I feel as though I've somehow cheated death and against all odds been given this gift of continuing my life."" And he recognizes this gift every single day. ""I actually have my boarding pass framed now, and it's sitting on my desk, right next to a little prayer book I keep with its page turned to Psalm 23,"" he said. ""I keep it there simply to remind myself that whatever happens to me, things could always be far worse.""","Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab allegedly tried to detonate bomb on Northwest Flight 253 .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Five months after the Deepwater Horizon explosion unleashed a torrent of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, a male dolphin washed up on Louisiana's Gulf Coast just barely alive. ""Other dead ones [dolphins] had exterior oiling on them,"" recalls Michele Kelley of the Audubon Nature Institute in New Orleans. ""He was the first live oiled marine mammal."" Oil covered the dolphin's body, but little was found in his blowhole or mouth -- a good sign. Rescuers noticed that the animal appeared to be underweight for his size and put his age at about 2 years old. The rescuers also saw injuries and believe he was beaten by another dolphin. ""For an animal as young as he is, he has a stat of about a 5% chance of survival,"" said Kelley, who oversees the rescue of stranded animals in Louisiana for the Audubon Nature Institute. ""Him, I would have given him maybe 2% max. He had a lot of issues, oil was his final issue."" Explore the depths of the Gulf Oil disaster . The rescue team photographed him and recorded him under the name LA-405.  He was later given the nickname ""Louie."" The rescue team took Louie to the Audubon Aquatic Center in New Orleans, cleaned him off, and began teaching him how to swim again. A staff member had to be in the water with him around the clock to hold Louie above the waterline so he could breathe. Otherwise, he would sink. It took over two and half weeks until the little dolphin showed signs of improvement. Louie started eating fish on his own and started learning how to swim again by moving his tail up and down. That was the beginning of an intense rehabilitation process. In the end it would take 700 hours of care over five months before Louie would be declared healthy. That was a bittersweet time for the Audubon Aquatic Center staff. ""You cry. You shed tears,"" Kelley says, ""You put five months into this animal, his rehab and seeing him everyday and taking care of him. Then it's time for him to go and we know that it's the best thing for him."" Despite his progress, it is too risky to release Louie into the wild because of his young age. So this week, with the help of the U.S. Coast Guard, Louie was transported the Dolphin Research Center in the Florida Keys, a nonprofit organization that cares for rescued dolphins. ""In dolphin maturity he would still be dependent on his mom and that whole structure of a maturity pod to learn foraging, to learn survival techniques, avoiding predators, things like that,"" said Mary Stella, a spokeswoman for Dolphin Research Center. In Louisiana, 62 dolphins have been collected since the oil spill, and all but two were found dead, according to Kelley. One of the two rescued died during rehabilitation. This left Louie as Louisiana's sole survivor, and the only rehabilitated dolphin to survive the worst oil spill in U.S. history. Timeline: Oil spill in the Gulf . Having just arrived at his new home, Louie will eventually be integrated into a group of other dolphins at the facility. He will also have to get used to his name, which he received upon arrival in the Florida Keys. ""Part of the reason we named him Louie is to immediately connect him to his Louisiana roots because here you have a little guy who has a real survivor story to tell,"" Stella says. ""He serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting these animals out in the wild and protecting the environment.""","""Louie"" the dolphin washed up on Louisiana's Fourchon Beach in September .

"(CNN) -- Take your thumb and hold it out directly in front of you, away from your face. Now close the left eye. Open it and close the right eye. Your thumb appears to have moved, even though you didn't move it with your arm. Three-D technology capitalizes on this effect, taking advantage of the brain's ability to fuse two images into one. Those glasses that you have to wear when watching something in 3-D are basically helping your brain interpret two flat images as one object that has depth. With the success of ""Avatar,"" a cluster of 3-D movies, including ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""How to Train Your Dragon"", are making their mark in Hollywood. Martin Scorsese recently announced plans to direct a 3-D film later this year. Nintendo also announced plans for a 3-D gaming console, the 3DS. Many electronics companies have 3-D television models, bringing the opportunity for this enhanced viewing into the home as networks begin to air more 3-D programming. Comcast's 3-D channel aired the Masters Golf Tournament earlier this month, and ESPN plans to launch a 3-D sports network this year. But doctors say that for eyes unaccustomed to watching 3-D for hours every day, there are some dangers, including mild symptoms such as disorientation and, in rare cases, seizures. The Samsung 3D LED TV comes with a substantial health warning. It cautions that certain flashing images or lights could induce epileptic seizure or stroke, and that ""motion sickness, perceptual aftereffects, disorientation, eye strain and decreased postural stability"" may result. Doctors say the percentage of people who should worry about significant adverse effects is small, especially the possibility of seizure. More commonly, people may experience dizziness or other discomfort after watching something in 3-D, including a feature film. One pair of 3-D glasses to rule them all . Symptoms of nausea, headache and fatigue may result because 3-D causes the eyes to move in an unnatural way, said an e-mail from Dr. Lisa Park, clinical assistant professor in the department of ophthalmology at New York University Langone Medical Center. Here's how it works: The 3-D movie presents two slightly different perspectives of the same scene, superimposed but separated by a specific degree. Three-D glasses have a polarized filter that separates those two images, allowing each to be seen by a different eye. This happens so fast that you don't see the transitions, said Steven Nusinowitz, associate professor of ophthalmology at the Jules Stein Eye Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles. In the brain, the two images are fused, creating the illusion of depth, he said. When you see something come toward you in the real world, your eyes slightly cross toward each other. At the same time, the lenses change shape in order to keep the object in focus as it moves in your direction, a process called accommodation. But when you see images on a screen, your eyes try to align the two images, but not ""accommodate,"" because the object is not actually moving toward you. ""The movie is telling you 'Hey, I'm moving around in this scene,' but your vestibular system is telling you, 'I'm not moving anywhere,' and that disconnect will make you feel sick, for some people,"" Nusinowitz said. Read about 3-D at CES . For those with certain underlying conditions, the artificial environment of a 3-D movie strains the ocular system, so when you take off the glasses it can be disorienting, said Dr. Norman Saffra, director of ophthalmology at Maimonides Medical Center in New York. People whose eyes are not perfectly aligned, or who have a weak eye muscle, will not be able to see in 3-D, Saffra said. Strabismus, a condition in which the eyes point in different directions, can be an impediment to seeing 3-D. Some people with amblyopia, or lazy eye, may also miss out on the depth perception effect when wearing 3-D glasses. Why I can't watch 3-D TV . Nusinowitz himself gets dizzy watching 3-D movies because his eyes have very different refractive errors -- he needs different prescription strengths in each lens of glasses. Still, based on experiences with patients, he said he believes he's in the minority. ""I'm willing to say that 80 percent of people will not have problems,"" he said. As for long-term effects of watching 3-D television instead of regular television, no one knows for sure because it's too new. Park is concerned about serious consequences for children who watch 3-D television for long periods of time -- ""a continuous abnormal stimulus may possibly have long-term effects that are yet to be studied,"" she said.","In 3-D movies, glasses help the brain fuse two images, creating the illusion of depth .

"Danville, Kentucky (CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden and Republican Paul Ryan, the man who wants his job, exchanged fire over taxes, Medicare, national security and some animated facial expressions in their only debate before Election Day. Here are five things we learned from Thursday night: . 1. Biden brought it . We expected Ryan, not Biden, to bring a three-ring binder full of facts and figures to the debate. It's not that the data-driven Ryan didn't show up with an arm full of his statistics; it is just that Biden did so as well. And Biden's aggressive offense from the very beginning drowned out Ryan until about 45 minutes into the debate. Biden's 36 years in the Senate served him well Thursday night. Who says that delivering hundreds of floor speeches on Capitol Hill isn't useful? The vice president also proved wrong the critics, who predicted he was going to make a gaffe. He didn't. In many ways, Biden stole a page from Mitt Romney's debate playbook: put your head down, charge forward and don't stop. Romney effectively employed this strategy last week, and Barack Obama was never able to recover. While Ryan put up a fight last night, he, too, was unable to regain his footing. The many expressions of Joe Biden . An Obama-Biden campaign official said before the debate that the vice president's goal was to try to compare and contrast the two competing campaigns' vision for the future. Whether you agree or disagree with the specifics of the Obama-Biden or Romney-Ryan plans, Biden did a better job of selling his last night. It will be several days until we know if this debate has helped the Obama-Biden campaign stem the political bleeding. But Biden did what he needed to do. 5 Independent perspectives on the VP debate . 2. Too much Joe? If Biden was on a mission to bring the fight to Ryan, then it appeared to be mission accomplished for the vice president. Moments into the debate, Biden went on the attack. ""On Iraq, the president said he would end the war. Gov. Romney said that was a tragic mistake,"" said Biden. Minutes later the vice president pushed back against criticism by the Wisconsin congressman, saying ""not a single thing he said is accurate."" Feisty vice presidential debate sets up Obama-Romney rematch . And he called other accusations by Ryan ""a bunch of stuff."" Biden went where President Barack Obama wouldn't last week in his debate with Romney, bringing up Romney's ""47%"" controversy as well as the Republican nominee's tax rate. And later, when Ryan discussed President John F. Kennedy's tax policies, Biden fired back: ""Oh, now you're Jack Kennedy?"" ""The vice president came and showed fight. He showed his boss what it is to engage and engage and engage and attack and attack and attack,"" said CNN Chief National Correspondent John King. ""I think Joe Biden did do his boss a lot of help,"" agreed Senior CNN Political Analyst David Gergen, who's advised both Democratic and Republican presidents. But was Biden too aggressive? ""I think Joe Biden is an authentic person. He speaks his mind. People know him. They expect that,"" Obama senior adviser David Axelrod said. ""I think that authenticity is something that people appreciate."" The Romney campaign disagreed. Poll: Debate watchers split on who won . ""The sighing, the eye-rolling, the grinning. I don't know if the vice president knew that there was a camera on him the whole time, that there was a split screen,"" senior Romney campaign adviser Russ Schriefer said. ""Even if we thought he was making good points, I think that they stepped on his good points. He was trying to cram everything in that he could that wasn't in the last debate to try and get it all out at once. But I don't think he made any kind of coherent argument as to why the Obama-Biden ticket should be re-elected."" Gergen agreed: ""On style I think that Paul Ryan won the debate. The Biden dismissive laughs, the interruptions, the sort of shouting, I think that Ryan was calmer and frankly more presidential."" What did debate watchers think? Seven out of 10 debate watchers in a CNN/ORC International poll said that Biden was the aggressor. Opinion: Hyper Biden, wonky Ryan . 3. Does the debate even matter? The short answer is no. People don't vote for vice presidents at the ballot box. They vote for presidents. Past vice presidential debates, no matter how high the drama, have ultimately done little to move the needle in modern elections. Not surprisingly, Biden's scenery-chewing performance was viewed differently by both campaigns. The Romney campaign said he looked erratic, rude and unhinged. The Obama campaign said he laid out the facts and made Ryan look, in the spin room words of former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, ""like a lightweight."" But a common refrain from both campaigns after the debate was that it will probably have a minimal effect on the race one way or the other. 25 funniest tweets about the VP debate . The biggest impact of the night, and the reason Democrats were ebullient after the debate, was the base-rallying impact of Biden's aggressive and blustery stage presence. In the wake of Obama's wilting flower routine in last week's debate, the full Biden, exasperated and angry with Romney and Ryan, was just what Democrats needed. How happy was team Obama? Campaign surrogates stayed in the spin room with puffed chests for much longer than they did in Denver, when they offered dubious messaging before escaping. The campaign immediately sent out a fundraising plea. President Obama put himself in front of cameras after landing at Andrews Air Force Base to praise Biden's performance. And it wasn't just the Obama camp. Democratic state parties, liberal interest groups and down-ballot campaigns rushed to send out fundraising e-mails to capitalize on a fired-up base. You didn't see much of the same on the Republican side. The debate launched a fresh news cycle that will put a temporary halt to the ""Chicago in disarray"" storylines. Now the pressure is on President Obama to keep that narrative going next week in New York. First two debates couldn't be more different . 4. Ryan rises to challenge . It was arguably Ryan's biggest task in the vice presidential debate. As the running mate to the Republican challenger, Ryan needed to convey that he's fit to serve should something happen to the commander in chief, that he would be acceptable to Americans as president. Known as an expert on economic and budget issues, early in the debate Ryan showed his smarts on foreign policy. During a discussion on troop drawdowns in Afghanistan, he explained how the seasonal changes affect the fighting in Afghanistan. Opinion: Sports bar Biden vs. seminar Ryan . ""The mountain passes fill in with snow. The Taliban and the terrorists and the Haqqani and the Quetta Shura come over from Pakistan to fight our men and women. When it fills in with snow, they can't do it. That's what we call fighting seasons. In the warm months, fighting gets really high. In the winter, it goes down,"" explained Ryan. ""And so when Adm. Mullen and Gen. Petraeus came to Congress and said, if you pull these people out before the fighting season ends, it puts people more at risk. That's the problem."" ""I think Ryan proved himself unexpectedly competent on foreign policy,"" said Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos, who worked for Romney's 2008 presidential bid. ""I think Ryan met his test tonight. Ryan looked very reasonable."" As expected, the Obama campaign disagreed. ""I think Congressman Ryan was out of his depth and showed clearly the ticket is not ready for prime time on foreign policy, and I think that was a decisive difference between the two sides,"" said Obama campaign manager Jim Messina. So what do debate watchers think? Did Ryan pass the competency test? Six out of 10 debate watchers in the CNN/ORC poll conducted said that Ryan is qualified to be president.

People apparently rushed to their computers to find out. ""Malarkey,"" it turns out, was the third-most-searched debate-related term of the night on Google. It was also trending on Twitter for a good chunk of time. For the record: it's basically the Irish-American term for ""nonsense.""

"(CNN) -- He is hoping to be one of the stars of the 2014 World Cup, but an injury blow for Luis Suarez has drawn extreme reaction from Uruguay football fans. Suarez is facing a race against time to be fit for the showpiece tournament in Brazil starting next month, and the player whose challenge required the Liverpool star to have knee surgery has been bombarded with death threats. Paul Dummett, who plays for Newcastle United, was sent off for his challenge on Uruguay's all-time leading scorer on the final day of the English Premier League season earlier this month. Uruguay has been drawn in the same group as England, and some fans took to Twitter to unleash their fury at the 22-year-old, with many posting violent messages on the social media network. One message read: ""Hi Paul Dummett. I hope some day you come here (Uruguay) to have a nice time with friends. We have things for you, like a bullet in the head."" Another tweeted: ""Hey, Paul Dummett. If SuÃ¡rez doesn't play against England, you'll never play again."" The English Football Association rescinded Dummett's suspension following the May 11 incident, and Suarez was able to join up with his national side for a training camp in Montevideo -- but limped out in a warmup on Wednesday and had a minor operation Thursday. The 27-year-old, who has scored 38 goals in 77 international appearances, is likely to be out of action for a fortnight after damaging his meniscus. Oscar Tabarez's side begins its World Cup campaign on June 15 against Costa Rica before facing England four days later in Sao Paulo, with a final group-stage match against Italy on June 24. Suarez left the hospital in a wheelchair following the procedure, but Uruguay's football association insists ""his participation in the World Cup in Brazil has not been ruled out."" ""He had a magnetic resonance which confirmed a partial lesion of the external meniscus,"" it said in a statement. ""In terms of relevant clinical history, to point out that he suffered a blow to his left knee during the last game of the Premier League season with Liverpool, which provoked a pain that subsided with rest following the end of the season."" Suarez, one the world's most potent strikers, enjoyed a successful season with Liverpool, becoming the first player to score 30 league goals for the club since Ian Rush in 1987. He was named player of the season but his team missed out on a first English title since 1990, finishing second behind Manchester City despite leading with three matches to play. Suarez helped Uruguay finish third at the 2010 World Cup but was sent off in the quarterfinal against Ghana after deliberately handling the ball on the goal line. Ghana missed the resulting penalty and Uruguay went on to progress to the semifinals. A year later, he helped Uruguay win its 15th Copa America by scoring in the 3-0 win over Paraguay in the final. Suarez has had a controversial career, twice receiving lengthy suspensions for biting opponents while playing for Liverpool and Dutch club Ajax. He was also banned for eight matches after being found guilty of racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra in October 2011.","Luis Suarez facing race against time to be fit for 2014 World Cup .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. federal grand jury in Texas has indicted the suspected top leaders of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel. Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman Loera and Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada Garcia face murder and conspiracy charges connected with drug trafficking, money laundering and organized crime. The indictment, returned April 11 and unsealed Tuesday, also charges 22 other people who prosecutors allege are connected with the cartel. It is one of several U.S. federal indictments charging Guzman, who is widely known as Mexico's most wanted fugitive and has made Forbes magazine's list of the world's most powerful people. ""It's a reminder we're right behind him, that he can't live out in the open. We need to get them apprehended,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Tony Franco said Tuesday. This month's indictment in western Texas detailed two acts of violence prosecutors said were committed by members of the cartel, including the 2010 kidnapping of an American citizen and two members of his family during a wedding ceremony in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, because of their ties with the rival Juarez cartel. The target was the groom and a resident of Columbus, New Mexico, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas said in a statement. Police found the bodies of the groom, his brother and his uncle three days after the wedding in the bed of a pickup truck, according to the indictment. The indictment also describes the 2009 kidnapping, killing and mutilation of a Texas resident ""to answer for the loss of a 670-pound load of marijuana seized by the Border Patrol,"" prosecutors said. Investigators found the Texas resident's body in Ciudad Juarez, according to the indictment. ""He had been beaten and strangled and his hands had been severed above the wrists and placed on his chest, to serve as a warning to those who might attempt to steal from the cartel,"" the indictment says. Guzman and Zambada have been indicted on drug trafficking and organized crime charges in a number of U.S. federal courts. U.S. officials have offered a $5 million reward for information leading to their capture. Guzman was arrested in 1993 on homicide and drug charges but escaped in 2001, reportedly by bribing prison guards to smuggle him out in a laundry truck. A Mexican federal investigation led to the arrest of more than 70 prison officials. Forbes magazine has placed him on its list of the world's most powerful people, reporting his net worth of $1 billion as of March. Rumors regularly surge about his whereabouts. Franco declined to comment on whether there was new information regarding Guzman's location. He described Guzman as ""a man who has unlimited means, more money than most people in Mexico."" ""It affords him the ability to hide,"" Franco added. The Sinaloa Cartel, named after the Mexican state where the gang was formed, is one of the most powerful drug-trafficking groups in the nation.

"(CNN) -- It's been a great week for Cleveland. On Monday, the Republican National Committee announced its intention to hold the 2016 GOP convention in Cleveland. Then on Friday, LeBron James said he was ""coming home"" to the Cavaliers. While sports analysts have universally praised the decision by ""King James,"" political observers have not been as kind to the Republicans. The consensus is that the location of political conventions doesn't affect elections. To a degree, this conclusion is supported by the political science literature, particularly a 2004 study by Richard Powell at the University of Maine, which found that parties gained no significant electoral benefits in states where they held conventions. One has to be careful, however, about reading too much into these past election results. After all, we only have one presidential election every four years. That means in the last 50 years, we have only 13 data points. Since each party holds a convention, perhaps that number can be doubled. Still, when looking at conventions, there is the additional problem of looking at all states as if they were equal. More than half of the 26 conventions held since 1964, however, occurred in only four states (Florida, New York, California and Texas). Moreover, the convention in Cleveland will be just the start of a major investment of time and money by the GOP in the Buckeye State. Clearly this was not the case in New York and Massachusetts, for example, where the Republicans and Democrats held their conventions in 2004. While it is true that the outcome of the 2016 race will not be determined solely by where the political conventions are held, this early choice might help Republicans at the margins. In our 50-50 nation, anything that moves the needle, even slightly, in one direction or the other, is important -- especially if that movement is in Ohio. It is very difficult to construct a plausible winning 2016 electoral map for Republicans that does not include Ohio. It is difficult to exaggerate just how evenly divided the two major parties are in Ohio. For example, if one adds up all the Democratic votes for president between 2000 and 2012, and then compares that number to all the corresponding Republican votes during that same period, the difference is only about 150,000 votes out of more than 21 million cast. This comes out to a difference of less than 1%. There is no reason to think, therefore, that the election won't be very close in Ohio in 2016. And this is where the choice of Cleveland becomes very interesting. For Republicans, the path to victory in Ohio runs directly through what Ohioans call the ""three C's"": Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. More accurately, the election depends on the final tallies in the three counties that contain these cities: Cuyahoga (Cleveland), Franklin (Columbus) and Hamilton (Cincinnati). These are by far the three largest counties in the state, which, taken together, account for nearly 30% of the population of Ohio. If, on election night in 2012, you began tabulating the vote in Ohio using these counties first, Republicans would have been seen as starting out behind by 413,590 votes. Working though the remaining 85 counties, the Republicans were not able to overcome this deficit, though they narrowed the gap to 166,272 votes. In comparison, the last time Republicans won Ohio (2004), Democrats came out of these three urban counties ahead by only 252,594 votes. It is not that Republicans have to actually win in any of these counties to win Ohio (they lost two out of three in 2004). They just have to narrow their losses. The problem for the GOP is that the trend is getting worse. Even though President Obama's margin of victory in Ohio dropped by almost 100,000 votes between 2008 and 2012, the Republican vote gap in these three countries increased by nearly 10,000 votes. Republicans simply cannot hope to win Ohio if they continue to do worse and worse in the three largest counties. But can the GOP use a Cleveland convention to turn this tide? Simply selecting Cleveland over the other finalist, Dallas -- pierogies over porterhouses -- sends a good message to the thousands of working-class voters who live in these counties. The millions of dollars that will flow into the coffers of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County because of the convention will also not hurt. Finally, there is a wild card that is precisely the kind of nuance that is often passed over by statistical analyses of past election results. A convention in Cleveland will allow the Ohio GOP to remind Cuyahoga County voters, and urban voters throughout Ohio, that they once supported Republicans. Without a doubt former Ohio governor, senator, and perhaps most importantly, Cleveland mayor, Republican George Voinovich, will be prominently featured in his home city convention. It bears noting that Voinovich carried all three counties during both his gubernatorial campaigns. In the end, the analysts may be right and, despite holding their convention in Ohio, Republicans will still lose both Ohio and the national election in 2016. Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, is very popular in Ohio. On the other hand, if Republicans do manage to capture both the state and the White House, it will be hard to not give some credit to the GOP leaders who decided to take their convention to Cleveland. And although it is too early to speculate, we should not discount the fact that two Ohioans, Sen. Rob Portman and Gov. John Kasich, have at least a shot at standing on the stage in Cleveland accepting their party's nomination for president.

"(CNN) -- A few weeks ago, an Arabic campaign exploded on Twitter. The Arabic hashtag -- #الراتب_مايكفي_الحاجة (loosely translated as ""the salary does not meet my needs"") -- reached 17 million tweets in the first two weeks. At its height, it registered 1.2 million tweets a day, and was not only the most popular hashtag in Arabic, but the 16th most popular in any language. Somewhat unexpectedly, the campaign, which hints at a financially aggrieved populace, comes out of one of the world's wealthiest nations: Saudi Arabia. ""There's a feeling among some people that I guess you could characterize as anger. Others are disappointed, some think it's a question of (the Saudi government's) priorities,"" says Fahad Nazer, a Saudi political analyst with JTG Inc. The anger he refers to is fueled by growing unemployment and frustration at government spending. Nazer notes that the campaign gained particular traction following the Saudi government's announcement that it would give financial aid to Egypt's military regime. ""The government is giving handouts to Egypt, Jordan and Tunisia, and using a third of the country's budget for this year to pay for the Riyadh metro. Meanwhile, Saudi's are paying most of their salary on rent, private schools, private hospitals -- because public ones aren't good -- while salaries have practically stayed the same,"" laments Manal Al Sharif, a Saudi activist who gained notoriety for posting video of herself driving on YouTube. She is also one of the country's most vocal tweeters. ""There's a long list of things that are wrong,"" she adds. Unemployment is higher than one might suspect in the oil-rich nation. Though official figures are hard to come by, there are approximately 1.8 million Saudis enrolled with Hafiz -- the country's unemployment benefits program -- according to Adam Coogle, a Middle East researcher with Human Rights Watch. The campaign has also drawn attention to a topic that was once considered taboo: Saudi poverty. Accompanying many of the tweets are images and video supposedly depicting Saudis living in squalor; some show Saudi's beggar class while others reveal the existence of Saudi shanties. Lynsey Addario, a photographer who documented Saudi poverty in Riyadh for Time Magazine, recalls how the assignment challenged her expectations. ""What you see on the surface are the shiny buildings and the shopping malls and the new universities being built -- the wealthy side. I was actually quite shocked when we went to the slums,"" she says. She recounted families struggling to pay the bills, and living in single-story, cockroach infested houses in the heart of Saudi Arabia's capital. ""Poverty in Saudi challenges many people's assumptions, including some Saudis',"" admits Nazer. Poverty and unemployment are particularly rife among Saudi youths (Coogle estimates they make up anywhere between 18 and 35% of the unemployment rate), and even more so among women. According to English-language newspaper the Saudi Gazette, an annual report put out earlier this year by the Ministry of Labor showed Saudi men in the private sector earn an average of $1,516, with women staffers pulling in half that sum. Al Sharif notes that working women are at a further disadvantage due to the many practices that are banned to them. ""A woman in Saudi is dependent on men to do just about everything in her life. If a man doesn't exist, she will have to pay for those services she can't do herself, like driving a car, starting her own business or going to court,"" she notes. Read more: Saudi Arabia's first anti-abuse campaign . Despite its popularity, the campaign has attracted critics who argue Saudis are already too reliant on their government. Nazer himself notes that the campaign risks oversimplifying what is actually a very complex issue. Several factors, he argues, have fed unemployment, including a population explosion -- since the '70s, Saudi has grown from 6 million people to nearly 20 million, with an additional 10 million expats competing with nationals for jobs. Adding to the problem is the fact that in the past, many Saudis chose to study religion and languages -- areas for which there is little demand. ""It's a complex situation, as is true of any economy. People who try to trivialize or simplify it miss a lot of variables,"" says Nazer. Regardless of where one stands on the issue, what's been particularly surprising is the willingness of Saudis -- who traditionally value cultural privacy -- to air their grievances in an international forum. ""It's true, we are a very private nation, and we don't want the rest of the world to know anything about us,"" admits Al Sharif. However, she says, it's a price many Saudis are willing to pay. ""Saudis are realizing that you can't isolate yourself from the rest of the world, because the only way we can communicate and read each other's views is through social media. It's our kind of parliament, where we can go and debate, and do things we can't do in the real world.""","Saudi Arabian Twitter users have flocked to a campaign bemoaning wages in their country.

"Washington (CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden and Republican vice presidential contender Paul Ryan plowed fertile ground in terms of policy and politics during their debate -- now the question is whether the presidential candidates can reap what was sown. Biden aggressively pressed Ryan on Thursday to defend his ticket's positions on everything from Medicare to trimming the nation's debt to the way forward in dealing with Iran. Biden tried to frame the election as a choice between different directions for the country by contending policies of the Mitt Romney-Ryan ticket would hurt the middle class and move the nation backward on social issues, like gay rights and abortion. In doing so, Biden helped set up President Barack Obama to further those arguments during the second presidential debate on Tuesday in New York, political experts say. For his part, Ryan was equally hard-charging and vigorously put forth the ticket's domestic and foreign policy proposals in exchanges that were at times sharp and pointed. Ryan repeatedly sought to focus the debate on the Obama-Biden record of the last four years, arguing the administration's policies hindered economic recovery and weakened the nation's standing and influence in the world. Five things we learned from Thursday's vice presidential debate . Romney is now well-primed to drive that message home. A CNN-ORC International poll released after the debate suggested voters who watched narrowly favored Ryan over Biden by 48%-44%, a statistically even result. That followed an overwhelming Romney victory in their first of three debates. ""I think they both accomplished the kinds of things they wanted to accomplish,"" said John Geer, chairman of Vanderbilt University's political science department. Political analysts say Biden also helped re-energize Democrats, whose spirits might have flagged after Obama's lackluster performance in last week's debate. 5 Independent perspectives on the VP debate . ""The most important job Biden did for Obama is reawakening the depressed Democratic base,"" said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. ""Biden has primed them for a better performance from Obama."" What Biden failed to do, some political analysts say, is make the case that Obama deserves another four years. That's up to the president when he takes the stage next week. Debate aftermath: Romney hammers Biden on Libya remark . Ron Brownstein, a CNN senior political analyst and editorial director of the National Journal, said ""as strong as Biden was,"" there was almost nothing on what a second Obama term would mean for America, especially on the economy. ""That is still the big missing piece in their argument,"" Brownstein said. Ryan was able to capitalize on Romney's momentum from his well-received debate performance. The Wisconsin congressman's performance further smooths Romney's path to charge ahead, political experts say. ""Ryan was a steady, unflappable presence onstage who made an articulate set of arguments in favor of conservative principles while also seeming sensitive and reasonable to many moderates,"" David Gergen, a senior political analyst for CNN, wrote Friday. ""Ryan was also surprisingly strong on foreign policy, holding his own against a man far more schooled in the subject."" However, some political watchers said Ryan's response on women's health issues could prove problematic for Romney during the next two debates. ""It's kind of the untalked about thing this morning -- raised a bunch of issues for the campaigns to be talking about over the next couple of weeks,"" Hilary Rosen, a Democratic pundit and CNN contributor, said. ""Yes, the economy is important, but when women have to worry about their health care and the economy, that's just an extra burden."" But CNN contributor and RedState blogger Erick Erickson, appearing on ""CNN Newsroom"" with Rosen, said most women agree with the Romney-Ryan position. ""I'm sorry, Hilary, but you're just wrong on this,"" he said. ""In the Gallup poll, the Pew poll, Mason Dixon poll, you name it, they show that the majority of women in this country, they are pro-life. They consider themselves for pro-life, with the exceptions Paul Ryan named (in the debate).""

"Table Mountain, Cape Town (CNN) -- For hundreds of millions of years it has dominated the coastal skyline of southern Africa, imposing a dramatic and domineering backdrop to an idyllic location. Table Mountain, recently voted one of the ""New Seven Wonders of Nature"" by a global audience, now joins the ranks of the Amazon rainforest of South America and other exotic sites throughout Asia. My task for 'Inside Africa' is to meet the most interesting people living in its shadow, connected to its spirit. The first people to live near this majestic mountain were the Khoi, migrating here some 2,000 years ago. As I hike through its rugged terrain near a feature called Lion's Head, I approach an unassuming man standing amid the rich biodiversity of flora and fauna. His name is Kerneels, a direct descendant of the Khoi, and he wants to show me a sacred place he visits regularly, but first he hands me something. See also: A journey through South Africa's stunning wine region . ""This is wild sage,"" he tells me as I raise it to my nose, ""anytime we journey to the shrine, we bring this to burn. It releases all negative energy."" I clutch it tightly as we make the 30-minute trek, off the hiking trail, up the steep terrain walking where few people venture. Kerneels stops along the way telling me every plant growing around us was used in some way by his ancestors. He snaps in half a stiff aloe vera leaf revealing a green goo and begins to apply it to his hair - I do the same. Kerneels says among medicinal uses, aloe keeps hair shiny and wavy. When we arrive at the shrine all I see are large rocks grouped together overlooking the coastline and South Atlantic Ocean - it was simply beautiful. In the center just an open space to sit; no pictures, no idols, no markings whatsoever. This is a place to be alone with one's thoughts. As wind whistles through the rock formations Kerneels whispers to me, describing how hard it is to be one of the few remaining Khoi people here. Their philosophy was one of use only what you need, and respect all forms of life on the mountain. A mantra almost lost with time as the modern world crept in, colonized the area, violently pushing out the Khoi. I sit silently allowing him to gather his next thought. He says my energy is positive, so we don't need to burn the sage. He sends me off with a heartfelt wish that visitors to Cape Town respect the hallowed ground and remember the first people to call this place home. Adding that while his ""people"" may be broken they are not defeated. In many ways Kerneels' request is being carried out by mother of two, Caron von Zeil. She's the founder of the ""Reclaim Camissa"" project. The Khoi first called Cape Town ""Camissa"" meaning ""the place of sweet waters"" because of its natural and clean streams stemming from the mountainside. The Dutch colonized it because of the abundant fresh water between the mountain range and the coast. But as the city grew, the waterways were gradually closed off (to limit pollution) and now all of it gets dumped into the South Atlantic. Blog: Discovering the real Zambia . I meet Caron at the foot of Table Mountain with her 10-year-old son. With a Master's degree in Environmental Planning and Landscape Architecture, Caron explains her research requires she map each and every stream, step by step, turn by turn. Her son likes to join the adventure. We pull back branches, jump over puddles and discover pristine waterways rushing down the porous sandstone of the mountain and over the solid granite of the ground. Later, Caron unlocks an old fence, walking me to a mysterious underground housing. Behind the four-foot-high Dutch style door is a pitch-black room. Inside, crystal clear water on its way to the ocean. Her calculations tell her there is enough fresh water in this system for all residents living in the immediate surroundings. Caron explains that efforts to lobby officials to reopen these water sources are falling on deaf ears - but still she charges on. Beyond the challenges of local bureaucracy she feels a deep-rooted commitment to the project and her Capetonian neighbors. Of course, the views atop Table Mountain are breathtaking, watching from 1,000 meters in the sky as white clouds roll over the cliff's edge, explaining why locals call this the ""tablecloth."" This is also one of the most photographed places in the world, but I wonder how many people truly see the beauty. I purposely didn't want to write about the sights, the awe inspiring views this week because of that. Instead I want people going to Cape Town to remember Kerneels and Caron; look closer, dig deeper and reflect on what the people of Table Mountain represent. My journey of discovery 'Inside Africa' has taken me through Victoria Falls in Zambia and all around Cape Town, South Africa and now I'm setting my compass to West Africa and the sights of Senegal... stay tuned.","CNN's Errol Barnett visited the Table Mountain in Cape Town, South Africa .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- One morning a couple of months ago at Westchester Medical Center, Dawn Verdick gave Daniel Flood one of her kidneys. Daniel Flood received a kidney from Dawn Verdick. They were brought together through Craigslist. Verdick and Flood were not friends or family. In fact, they were total strangers from the East and West coasts. But that's not the most unusual aspect of this case. The patient and donor were brought together after Flood's three daughters placed an ad on Craigslist, the online classifieds site that offers everything from autos to real estate and guitar lessons to massage. ""Please help us, my dad needs a kidney!"" began their posting in the site's volunteer section.  Watch more on the Craigslist-kidney connection » . ""It was a shot in the dark, but it had worked for everything else,"" Jennifer Flood said. After years of untreated high blood pressure, Flood's levels of creatinine had risen, indicating damage to the kidney. The bean-shaped, fist-sized organs process blood to sift out waste products and extra water. More than 15 million Americans have some degree of kidney disease, according to estimates. Flood's doctor told him he needed a transplant or dialysis. Both options have pros and cons. Dialysis can be hard on the heart and takes up time several days a week. Making Flood's situation more difficult was the fact that the retired 68-year-old life insurance salesman was born with only one kidney. In addition, Flood's rare O-negative blood type made the odds even tougher. None of Flood's daughters, or his immediate family, was a match. Jennifer and sisters Cynthia and Heather, all in their early 30s, vowed to find their father a living donor. ""We knew that the waiting list was two to six years. And we knew how dialysis takes a toll on your body, and we knew we had to save Dad.'' About three-quarters of kidney transplants are between family members, and the rest are among friends and acquaintances, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, a not-for-profit organization that manages the nation's transplant system. Nearly 75,000 Americans were waiting for a kidney by the end of 2007, according to the organization. Just over 16,000 on the wait list received one, about 6,000 of them from living donors. Although the number of kidney donors has grown since 1998, the wait list has doubled as the incidence of diabetes, a leading cause of kidney disease, rises to crisis levels. A kidney from a deceased donor is far more likely to be rejected than one from a living donor and may not hold up for the recipient's lifetime. ""Kidneys from living donors last, on average, 25 years while kidneys from cadavers last an average of 10 years, because kidneys from living donors are usually in better shape,'' said Dr. Jonathan Lazare, a urologist with the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. Visit CNNhealth.com, your connection for better living . The Floods received more than 100 responses to the Craigslist ad. Many sounded genuinely interested in helping, but others sought to sell a kidney, which is illegal in the United States. One encounter with a young man from the Washington area was especially disheartening. The man traveled to the Floods' home in Pleasantville, New York, just outside New York City, and even stayed with them a few days. Soon after, he e-mailed Jennifer Flood to say he had only wanted to see the city. Internet appeals for organ donations raise a number of questions of fairness, one medical ethicist said. ""Ideally, organs should be fairly allocated on basis of medical need and time on the waiting list,"" said Dr. Kenneth Prager, director of clinical ethics and chairman of the Medical Ethics Committee at New York Presbyterian Hospital. ""Solicitations undermine the concept of a level playing field."" But, he added, ""we are a country with free speech. There is nothing illegal in advertising or in using the Web for personal or health reasons. Altruistic organ donors have the legal right to designate recipients."" And he sees a potential benefit from the Internet. ""An important argument supporting the solicitation of donors through advertising is that many such altruistic unrelated donors would never have given their organs without being moved by the personal stories of the patients on the Web,"" Prager said. ""As such, patients who solicit such donors do not do so at the expense of others on the list. By expanding the population of organ donors, Web sites such as matchingdonors.com or Craigslist can benefit the population of those in need of organs as a whole."" For the Flood family, the breakthrough came when Verdick, who lives in Monterey, California, went on Craigslist for the first time to look for a volunteer project when a close friend died. ""I didn't set out to donate a kidney,'' said Verdick, 48, the founder of a not-for-profit educational organization. The ad initially caught her attention because it mentioned her blood type. ""I turned it over to the universe early on. And I just said, 'If it's meant to be, then I will qualify, and if it's not, I won't.' '' Verdick was such a strong match that doctors said it was as if she and Flood were close relatives. As part of the screening process, Verdick underwent two psychological evaluations. One question asked how she would react if she were to donate and later have kidney failure. '""What if I'm hit by a bus tomorrow?"" she responded. ""There's a lot of 'what ifs.'

"(CNN) -- Dinosaur skeletons illegally smuggled in to the United States have been turned over to the Mongolian government in a repatriation ceremony Thursday. U.S. authorities officially turned over 18 dinosaur skeletons -- including a ""nearly complete"" Tyrannosaurs Bataar, Saurolophus Angustirostris, and an Oviraptor, a fossilized egg and a ""grave yard"" containing the remains of at least five dinosaurs. During the ceremony, U .S. Attorney Preet Bharara and James T. Hayes, Jr., Special Agent in Charge at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) returned the historic items to Od Och, Mongolia's Permanent Representative to the United Nations. ""A recovery of this sort is really without precedent,"" said Bharara. ""This is a historic event for the U.S. Attorney's office as well as a prehistoric event."" On display, was a multicolored egg that looks much like a rock, a large rock containing the remains of multiple Oviraptors, and another rock with two well preserved Gallimimus. The looted fossils are 68 to 80 million years old and originated from the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, which had much more water at the time, said paleontologist Mark Norell during the ceremony. The bones were disassembled into many pieces before being smuggled through customs between 2005 and 2012, said Hayes. The Department of Homeland Security Investigations seized the skeletons from a commercial paleontologist, Eric Prokopi, who pleaded guilty in 2012 to smuggling and other charges. Prokopi had a ""vast inventory"" of historical items in a number of locations under his control, said Hayes. In June, Prokopi was sentenced to three months in jail and one year and three months supervised release on charges related to smuggling, conspiracy, and sale or receipt of stolen goods, according to ICE. Under Mongolian law, dinosaur fossils are property of the Mongolian government and exporting them from the country is a criminal offense. Och expressed his appreciation to the U.S. attorney and the agencies involved in the recovery. ""This can be seen as best practice of international cooperation to fight organized crime,"" Och said. The skeletons returned to the Mongolian government are very important, said Norell. ""They are extraordinarily rare."" Prokopi was also at the center of a 2013 investigation that led to the recovery and reparation of a ""nearly complete"" skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus bataar to the Mongolian government. Bharara and ICE turned over a skeleton standing 8 feet tall and stretching 24 feet in length after it was illegally smuggled and changed hands several times, including being sold at auction. ""The fossils returned today do not belong in the hands of any private collection or one owner,"" said Hayes. ""They belong to the people of Mongolia where they will be displayed in their national museum alongside the Bataar ICS repatriated last year.""

"(TIME.com) -- Over the last 20 years, the number of parents sharing a bed with their infants has doubled. That revelation, published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, concerns doctors, as in that same time, greater awareness of the dangers of bed sharing, which include sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), accidental suffocation, and getting trapped in bedding, have also increased. According to the survey, the percentage of infants who shared a bed with their caregivers rose from 7% in 1993 to 14% in 2010. The upward trend was strongest among African-American infants; in 1993, 21% co-slept with an adult, while in 2010 39% did. The findings point to the weak penetration of public health messages urging parents to give each child her own place to sleep not just for safety reasons, but to make the transition to independent sleeping arrangements easier later on. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents put babies in their own sleeping area in the parents' room. TIME.com: Why infants shouldn't sleep with Mom and Dad . The research, funded and conducted by the National Institutes of Health, surveyed 20,000 caregivers about their bed sharing habits. While more parents were cuddling up with their infants compared to earlier years, despite the known health risks, the researchers did discover that parents would listen to their pediatricians if they were warned about the dangers of the practice. Caregivers who believed that their family doctor did not approve of bed sharing were 34% less likely to report co-sleeping with an infant than caregivers who did not receive such advice from their doctor. In an accompanying editorial, however, Dr. Abraham Bergman of Harborview Medical Center in Seattle argued that there isn't strong evidence to link co-sleeping arrangements with a higher risk of SIDS or suffocation. He noted that bed sharing can strengthen the bond between parents and infants, and that the practice could make breastfeeding easier for mothers. (In fact, a recent study found a strong connection between bed sharing and extended breasfeeding.) More studies may be needed to tease apart the relative benefits and risks of the practice, especially since the latest data shows that co-sleeping is becoming increasingly popular with parents.

"(CNN) -- An unknown tennis player ranked number 100 burst from obscurity and knocked Rafael Nadal out of Wimbledon Thursday. Lukas Rosol defeated the number 2 ranked Nadal, 6-7 (9-11) 6-4 6-4 2-6 6-4. Fresh off the biggest win of his life, Rosol said: ""Before the last game, I was not sure if I will be shaking or not because it was the first time against Rafa and the first time also in Wimbledon Center Court. You never know what to expect, so it was not easy, and I survived."" Rosol comes from Prerov, Czech Republic. He made his Wimbledon debut after losing in the first round of qualifying the last five years. In contrast, Nadal has reached the Wimbledon finals five times in the last six years, winning the title twice. Both players are 26 years old. Rosol started playing tennis at age six, and his hobby is listed as watching sports, according to his ATP profile. His favorite surface to play is clay, although his latest victory came on Wimbledon's famous grass courts. Prior to the season, Rosol had never won a tour-level grass-court match, according to ATP. Looking dismayed after his earliest Grand Slam defeat in seven years, Nadal spoke haltingly in a press conference. ""These kinds of matches can happen. Today it happened,"" said Nadal, who has won 11 Grand Slam titles. Later, Nadal tweeted in Spanish: It couldn't be...This is sport! You must know how to celebrate wins and assume defeats!

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney heads in to Illinois's presidential primary this week with a handy win in Puerto Rico, pocketing the territory's 20 GOP delegates in a bruising race that has become a numbers game for the Republican nomination. With about 83% of total ballots accounted for early Monday in Puerto Rico, Romney had garnered more than 98,000 votes -- or 83% of the total -- based on unofficial results obtained from local party and election officials. Rick Santorum was a distant second, at 8% with slightly more than 9,500 votes. The other two candidates, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas Rep. Ron Paul, were barely registered in the race with 2,431 votes, or 2% of the vote, and 1,452 votes, or 1%, respectively. Even as the vote was being counted in Puerto Rico, Romney, Santorum and the other candidates were already on the mainland vying for delegates in Illinois and Louisiana. Illinois holds its primary on Tuesday and Louisiana on Saturday. CNN's latest delegate estimates show Romney with 518 delegates to Santorum's 239. Gingrich has 139 delegates, and Paul, the libertarian champion, has 69 delegates. To secure the nomination, 1,144 delegates are needed. Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, was in Louisiana late Sunday, where he is expected to win the primary. Romney was in Illinois where polls indicate he holds a small lead over Santorum, with Gingrich and Paul well behind. Romney framed his win in Puerto Rico as the territory's desire for a candidate that ""most represents their feelings"" -- and especially their desire to nominate some who can bring about a stronger economy and a smaller government. He also said his party can appeal to Latinos, and win the presidency, with a low-tax, pro-business message. ""Those people who don't think that Latinos will vote for a Republican need to take a look in Puerto Rico,"" said the former Massachusetts governor, noting that the territory's governor and its legislative leaders are conservative. ""Hispanic voters are going to vote for Republicans if we stand for something -- conservative principles that bring growth and good jobs and rising home values. That's how we're going to win, and we're going to get Latino voters to help us out."" Romney had entered the contest in Puerto Rico as the favorite. He was largely backed by the island government's political establishment, including Gov. Luis Fortuno, who campaigned with Romney last week. Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, created a small political firestorm on the island in the days leading up to the primary when he said English should be the principal language in Puerto Rico before it could gain statehood. Puerto Rico will vote on a statehood referendum in November. After arriving in Puerto Rico on Friday, Romney said he would have ""no preconditions"" on language for Puerto Rico to gain statehood, though during a CNN debate in January he said English should be the nation's official language. Santorum immediately hit back, accusing Romney of flip-flopping. Romney fired back that English has been the official language of the government in Puerto Rico for more than 100 years. The heated, see-saw allegations between the two candidates have marked much of the race for the GOP nomination, which Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, called ""the nastiest I've ever seen"" during an appearance Sunday on NBC's ""Meet The Press."" Puerto Rico's primary came two days before the showdown in Illinois, where 54 delegates will be awarded proportionally and polls show a tight race between Romney and Santorum. Asked over the weekend while campaigning in Missouri about whether a win in Illinois would mean he'd win the nomination, Santorum said: ""We feel very, very good about it. Let's put it that way. Really good about it."" Santorum also challenged Romney's assertion that his business experience is one of his strongest credentials, telling CNN's Candy Crowley on ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that, ""If Gov. Romney thinks that he is the CEO of America and can run and manage the economy, he doesn't understand what conservatives believe in."" Romney's campaign released an ad in Illinois on Friday, attacking Santorum for having ""never run a business or a state."" Santorum on Sunday said he had experience in the private sector as a lawyer, but argued that executive experience at a company is not necessary to be commander-in-chief. ""Running a business is not the same as being president of the United States,"" he said. Santorum also gave no indication that he has plans to drop out of the race should his campaign reach a point where the delegate math doesn't add up in his favor. ""What I'm hearing is that we want a conservative nominee, that the establishment is trying to push a moderate like they did in 1976 against Ronald Reagan, like they did in 1996 with Bob Dole and what they did with John McCain,"" Santorum said. ""I think conservatives would like an opportunity to nominate a conservative, and that's an opportunity."" Both Santorum and Romney also focused their rhetoric at President Barack Obama, particularly with regard to rising gas prices. Romney said Obama needed to fire Secretary of Energy Steven Chu and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar for their role in driving up gas prices. ""Given the fact that (Obama has) changed his policies, wants lower gas prices, he needs to fire them and return to the energy policies we need,"" Romney said during a town hall meeting in Collinsville, Illinois. Santorum told a crowd in Effingham, Illinois, to remember Obama at the gas pumps. ""When you see that zero come up, when it gets to the $100 range, when you see the zero, think of 'O' for Obama because that's why you are paying that extra amount of money,"" Santorum said. CNN's Jim Acosta, John Helton, Ashley Killough, Rachel Streitfeld and Shannon Travis contributed to this report. Watch State of the Union with Candy Crowley Sundays at 9am ET.

"(CNN) -- Three-time Tour de France winner Alberto Contador has been stripped of his 2010 title and retroactively banned from cycling for two years following Monday's ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. He could also face a fine of more than $3 million, but this will be decided at a later CAS hearing. The Spaniard tested positive for the banned anabolic steroid clenbuterol during the sport's premier race in July 2010, and the results were revealed in September that year. He was initially suspended for one year by the Spanish Cycling Federation after claiming that he had eaten contaminated meat, which left small amounts of the drug in his urine sample, and was then acquitted on appeal in February 2011. However, the International Cycling Union (UCI) and the World Ant-Doping Agency (WADA) both contested the ruling, and appealed to CAS. The UCI also asked that Contador be fined at least â‚¬2.485 million. The court's decision means that the 29-year-old will lose his race victories during 2011, including the Giro d'Italia. His ban will end on August 5 this year. CAS said the ban started retroactively on January 25, 2011 -- the start date of his original ban -- but was reduced by the time he had already been suspended of five months and 19 days. The UCI confirmed the decision on its website, but called it ""the end of a long-running affair that has been extremely painful for cycling."" ""This is a sad day for our sport. Some may think of it as a victory, but that is not at all the case,"" UCI president Pat McQuaid said. ""There are no winners when it comes to the issue of doping: every case, irrespective of its characteristics, is always a case too many."" The case had dragged on after the first two hearings were canceled before a third was finally held in November last year. The UCI and WADA both submitted that it was more likely that Contador had either had a blood transfusion or eaten a contaminated food supplement rather than the meat scenario. CAS agreed in its ruling, stating: ""Unlike certain other countries, notably outside Europe, Spain is not known to have a contamination problem with clenbuterol in meat. Furthermore, no other cases of athletes having tested positive to clenbuterol allegedly in connection with the consumption of Spanish meat are known. ""The panel concluded that both the meat contamination scenario and the blood transfusion scenario were, in theory, possible explanations for the adverse analytical findings but were however equally unlikely. ""In the panel's opinion, on the basis of the evidence adduced, presence of clenbuterol was more likely caused by the ingestion of a contaminated food supplement."" Past cases of positive clenbuterol tests have had different outcomes. Last year more than 100 footballers at the under-17 World Cup were cleared by FIFA due to a ""serious health problem with regards to meat contaminated with clenbuterol"" in host nation Mexico. Five members of that country's senior team also escaped punishment after testing positive at the CONCACAF Gold Cup later that year. Two Chinese swimmers were banned for three years in 1999 after eating contaminated pig livers, but in 2010 a German table tennis player was cleared following a hair test after his positive result during a competition in China. Andy Schleck, who was runner-up at the 2010 Tour de France, said he would not be happy to be installed as the new winner. ""First of all I feel sad for Alberto. I always believed in his innocence. This is just a very sad day for cycling. The only positive news is that there is a verdict after 566 days of uncertainty. We can finally move on,"" the rider from Luxembourg said. ""I trust that the CAS judges took all things into consideration after reading a 4,000-page file. If now I am declared overall winner of the 2010 Tour de France it will not make me happy. I battled with Contador in that race and I lost. ""My goal is to win the Tour de France in a sportive way, being the best of all competitors, not in court. If I succeed this year, I will consider it as my first Tour victory.""","Court of Arbitration for Sport overturns ruling by the Spanish Cycling Federation .

"Berlin (CNN) -- The outbreak of E. coli in Germany has killed several more people and sickened hundreds, authorities said Tuesday. News reports citing local authorities reported 16 deaths linked to E. coli in some raw vegetables. CNN has confirmed at least 12 deaths. As more people have died, the outbreak has shown itself to be spreading geographically as well. No longer contained in northern Germany, the outbreak has killed at least two people in the western part of the country. One of the 16 deaths was in Sweden. A woman died after visiting Germany, the Swedish Ministry for Health and Social Affairs said. The Robert Koch Institute, Germany's federal unit responsible for disease control and prevention, said 373 people have been confirmed sickened. But figures coming in from local authorities and hospitals made clear many more people are believed to be infected. ""Here in Hamburg we're pretty much at the epicenter,"" Jorg Debatin, medical director of the Hamburg Medical Center, told CNN. His hospital has 600 to 700 infected patients, Debatin said. About 20% to 30% of them develop hemolytic-uremic syndrome, or HUS, ""a very severe complication,"" he said. The hospital is especially concerned about 85 patients -- 20 children and 65 adults -- who may go into renal failure and develop neurologic symptoms, he said. Sweden's health ministry said there have been 39 confirmed cases of people sickened by E. coli in Sweden, 16 of which are being investigated for complications caused by HUS. All 39 patients recently visited 39 Germany. No contaminated vegetables have been reported in Sweden, the ministry said. While authorities in Germany worked to contain and respond to the outbreak, the specific cause remained unclear. The European Food Safety Alert Network said EHEC, or enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, a strain of E. coli that causes hemorrhage in the intestines, was found in organic cucumbers originating from Spain, packaged in Germany, and distributed to countries including Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg and Spain. But the source has not yet been pinpointed, authorities said. Hans-Joachim Breetz, executive director of Hamburg's Institute for Sanitation and Environment, said it can take days or weeks to find a source of infection. In the meantime, ""the warning remains not to eat raw cucumbers, leaf lettuce or tomatoes,"" said Cornelia Pruefer-Storcks, . Hamburg's top official for health and consumer protection. European Union spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde-Hansen told CNN that German authorities were examining cucumber batches from the Spanish cities of Almeria and Malaga as potential sources of infection. She also said a shipment originating in Denmark or the Netherlands is being checked. The questions surrounding produce from Spain have ""paralyzed"" vegetable exports, a spokeswoman for Fepex, the Spanish export producers group for vegetables and fruits, said Tuesday. The industry in Spain expects weekly losses of about 200 million euros ($288 million), Fepex officials said. Fepex President Jorge Brotons and Director General Jose Maria Pozancos called on Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to step in, the spokeswoman said. The Fepex officials argue that German authorities have accused the Spanish cucumber of being the source of the outbreak, without proof. Spanish Health Minister Leire Pajin discussed the outbreak on Twitter. ""In the absence of proof. we're not ruling out using all necessary measures to make sure there's compensation for the (economic) damage,"" she wrote. ""From the first day, the government launched a diplomatic offensive to prevent the linking of this health crisis with our products."" Germany is the top purchaser of Spain's produce, according to Fepex. In 2010, Spain exported 9.4 million tons of produce; a quarter of that went to Germany, Fepex said. A Spanish health ministry spokesman told CNN that Spanish authorities are investigating the outbreak. Initial results that could cite a potential casue are expected by Thursday, or possibly as early as Wednesday, the spokesman said. Spanish authorities are sharing their investigative results with German and European Union authorities, the spokesman added. The Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition said two Spanish companies producing cucumbers may be involved in the outbreak. The agency was awaiting further results from Germany's investigation. The Robert Koch Institute said Germany's Federal Institute for Risk Assessment ""advised against eating raw tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuces to prevent further cases.""

"Washington (CNN) -- When Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine rocked the political world with her announcement that she would not seek a fourth term in the Senate, she was forthright in expressing her frustration with ""an atmosphere of polarization"" in politics. But for all her transparency, it was one of Snowe's Senate colleagues who perhaps best summed up her motivation for deciding to end her decades-long tenure on Capitol Hill. ""I think she lost hope,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told CNN. Graham, who like Snowe had participated in bipartisan efforts to find compromise on hot-button issues, added, ""You know, all of us need to believe there is a light at the end of the tunnel. If you lose that belief, why do you spend seven years of your life -- which in her case would have been her commitment -- to do something that there seems no hope."" Citing partisanship, Snowe makes surprising exit . Snowe is the latest in a string of centrist senators to announce that they will not seek re-election in the fall. Late last year, Sen. Ben Nelson, a conservative Democrat from Nebraska, announced that he would not seek re-election in 2012. In a statement announcing his decision, Nelson called for ""those who will follow in my footsteps to look for common ground and to work together in bipartisan ways to do what's best for the country, not just one political party."" At the beginning of 2011, Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut who caucuses with Senate Democrats but agrees with Senate Republicans on many issues of foreign policy and national security, announced he would not run again in 2012. ""I have not always fit comfortably into conventional political boxes,"" Lieberman said at the time, ""Democrat, Republican, liberal or conservative. Because I've always thought my first responsibility is not to serve a political party but to serve my constituents, my state, and my country."" Nelson and Lieberman are joined by Sens. Jim Webb, a centrist Democrat from Virginia focused on military and foreign affairs; Kent Conrad, a North Dakota Democrat who said a re-election campaign would distract him from focusing on trying to solve the nation's serious challenges; and Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat. Retiring senators: Time is ripe for bipartisanship . While Snowe's departure is indicative of growing partisanship in the Senate, it will also be an unexpected obstacle to conservatives' ambition of regaining a Republican majority in the Senate. Democrats hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate but are defending 23 of the 33 seats up for grabs in November, including those of two independents who caucus with the Democrats. ""It's a significant blow to Republican prospects in picking up the Senate,"" Stuart Rothenberg, editor and publisher of the Rothenberg Political Report, said. ""They're going to now have to defend a very difficult seat."" In the wake of Snowe's announcement, both Rothenberg and the Cook Political Report, both of which are nonpartisan, changed their ratings of the outlook for her Senate seat in the general election from ""likely Republican"" to a toss-up. Snowe explains reasons for leaving . Rothenberg said that he thought ""probably most people would agree"" with Snowe's comments about the climate in the Senate. Congress' upper chamber is starting ""to look more and more like the House,"" observed Rothenberg, where Republicans and Democrats have recently found themselves in the past year on opposite sides of an ideological gulf. ""[The Senate's] not there yet,"" Rothenberg said, ""but it starts to look more like the House where you have people increasingly on both ends of the spectrum and relatively few people in the middle. And the people on each partisan side are more hesitant to compromise."" ""The center has been under siege in our Congress,"" CNN contributor John Avlon said. ""This is not normal and it's not healthy for our democracy,"" Avlon also said about the heightened level of partisanship in Congress currently. Avlon: Snowe's departure symptom of partisan illness . Avlon added, ""We've had divided government before and we've been able to accomplish great things in our history . . . but because hyper-partisanship has hijacked our politics with this divided government [right now] we've got dysfunctional government."" What Avlon sees as dysfunction that impedes achieving bipartisan consensus, others -- especially conservatives and tea party movement activists -- see as a necessary and principled commitment to core ideological values. Indeed, backed by support from the tea party movement, a cadre of close to 90 freshman Republican House members arrived in Washington in 2011 committed to imposing fiscal discipline and either rolling back or stopping many of Democrats' key policy priorities. ""You're calling them centrists and moderates,"" Amy Kremer, chairman of the Tea Party Express, said of Snowe and others on Capitol Hill. ""But they're not centrists and moderates in the things that matter to us, and that's fiscal responsibility."" ""They are extreme on the spending,"" Kremer added, ""and because of their reaching across the aisle and continuing to compromise we are now [close to] $16 trillion in debt. That's extreme. And we cannot support people like that."" Although observers like Rothenberg believe Snowe would have survived a primary challenge and won re-election, a year ago the Tea Party Express included Snowe on its 2012 target list. ""She's definitely one that has voted to spend more and grow government and she's definitely not a small-government, rein-in-the-spending senator,"" Kremer said of her organization's decision to target Snowe for ouster. Asked about the paradoxical situation created by Snowe's decision, with the GOP now facing a new obstacle in retaking the Senate, Kremer made no apologies for the tea party movement's push for more commitment to conservative fiscal principles. ""Regardless of whether President Obama is re-elected or not, we need to take back the Senate,"" Kremer said. ""We have changed the narrative,"" added Kremer, ""Never before have Democrats even been talking about cutting spending. So we have to take that gavel out of [Senate Majority Leader] Harry Reid's hand."" Kremer said Republican Sens. Jim DeMint of South Carolina, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah are examples of the kind of fiscal conservatives that the tea party movement would like to see more of in the Senate after this fall's election. Despite partisan pressures for firmer ideological commitments from conservatives and the tea party movement on the right, and increasingly from liberals and the Occupy Wall Street movement on the left, some centrists remain in the Senate. ""I am concerned when people like Evan Bayh, Olympia Snowe and Ben Nelson leave the Senate,"" said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia. ""I hope and pray it doesn't mean the end of sensible people in the Senate who wan to get things done."" Warner was a member of the so-called ""Gang of Six,"" a bipartisan group of senators who tried prior to the creation of the debt ""Super Committee"" this summer to arrive at a deficit-reduction deal that would have shaved roughly $4 trillion off the federal deficit. Although the ""Gang of Six"" did not succeed in crafting a plan that garnered enough support for passage in the Senate, Warner was quick to point out that the bipartisan effort did get 45 senators to sign on to its broad, bipartisan deficit reduction plan. And far from giving up on bipartisanship, Warner said that he and Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, have been hosting a series of bipartisan dinners for their fellow senators. Four have been held so far, Warner said, with about 20 senators attending each gathering so that a majority of the Senate has already participated in the events. Republican shake-ups in Senate leadership . ""It does worry me if you allow voices on the ends of the political extreme to dominate the debate,"" Warner said, ""That's not where the American people are. They want us to get things done."" Pointing to Congress' historically low approval rating, Warner said he thinks its ""both good policy and good politics"" to try to figure out ways to get things done in Congress. Warner said he was ""disappointed"" to hear that Snowe would not seek re-election. ""She's a great senator,"" the Democrat said of his Republican colleague, ""She didn't view every issue through a partisan prism."" On the same day that Warner praised his soon-to-be former colleague, Snowe held a news conference in her native Maine to explain her surprise decision. Snowe told a gathering of family, friends, staff, and reporters that she did not see the partisan atmosphere in Congress changing. ""To the contrary, what I like to call the sensible center has now virtually disappeared in Washington,"" Snowe said. CNN's Ted Barrett, Dana Bash, Paul Steinhauser, Rebecca Stewart, Alexander Mooney, Shannon Travis and Mark Preston contributed to this report.","Sen.

"(CNN) -- The issue of whether English should be a requirement for Puerto Rico to be considered for statehood lasted for a third day -- two days ahead of the U.S. territory's Republican presidential primary -- and provided Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum with opportunities to take shots at each other. The back and forth began Wendesday, when Santorum said while campaigning in Puerto Rico that English should be the principal language in Puerto Rico before it could gain statehood. Puerto Rico will vote on a statehood referendum in November. Romney's campaign issued a statement Thursday contrasting his position on the issue with Santorum's. ""Puerto Rico currently recognizes both English and Spanish as the official languages of the commonwealth,"" Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul said. ""Gov. Romney believes that English is the language of opportunity and supports efforts to expand English proficiency in Puerto Rico and across America. However, he would not, as a prerequisite for statehood, require that the people of Puerto Rico cease using Spanish."" But at CNN's debate in Jacksonville, Florida, in January ahead of Florida's primary, Romney said that English should be the nation's official language. After arriving in Puerto Rico on Friday, Romney said he would have ""no preconditions"" on language for Puerto Rico to gain statehood. Minutes later, Santorum deputy communications director Matt Beynon tweeted, ""So Romney once supported English as national language, then goes to Puerto Rico and says no language req on statehood. #FlipFlop? #Pander?"" Santorum's communications director, Hogan Gidley, noted broad support for English as the nation's official language and said in an e-mail to reporters, ""How can Romney say he supports English as the official language of America and not believe Puerto Rico should speak English? If he'll spend the whole election being untruthful about his positions -- it makes you wonder what else he's being untruthful about."" But Saul responded, ""Gov. Romney supports making English the official language of the United States government. This should have no impact on Puerto Rico's statehood effort. English has been an official language of Puerto Rico for over 100 years."" Romney was also asked in Puerto Rico about his criticism of Puerto Rican Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, which has roiled some Puerto Rican voters. ""In looking at Justice Sotomayor, my view was that her philosophy is quite different than my own, and that's the reason why I would not support her as a justice for the Supreme Court,"" Romney said. ""Had I been in the Senate -- I was not in the Senate -- I would be happy to have a justice of Puerto Rican descent or a Puerto Rican individual on the Supreme Court, but they would have to share my judicial philosophy. That comes first."" Santorum's campaign announced Friday that it had brought in $1 million since its twin wins in Alabama and Mississippi on Tuesday. But then he was forced to address an off-message issue when asked about an undated post on his website that said the country is ""suffering a pandemic of harm from pornography,"" including ""profound brain changes in both children and adults."" At an event in Illinois on Friday, Santorum said, ""I said that as a president, I would enforce the law, which is not being done now."" The post on Santorum's campaign site criticizes the current administration, saying the Justice Department is failing to prosecute the law. ""The Obama Administration has turned a blind eye to those who wish to preserve our culture from the scourge of pornography and has refused to enforce obscenity laws,"" the site said. ""While the Obama Department of Justice seems to favor pornographers over children and families, that will change under a Santorum Administration."" Santorum has been criticized by some Republicans from focusing too much on social issues when the economy is most on voters' minds. The former Pennsylvania senator was campaigning in Illinois ahead of that state's primary on Tuesday. Romney campaigned in the state on Friday morning before flying to Puerto Rico. Romney predicted victory in Illinois on Friday morning and focused more on President Barack Obama than his Republican opponents, hitting familiar themes, like gas prices. The Republican front-runner responded to Obama's energy speech on Thursday, telling a crowd in Rosemont, ""He is out there pushing for alternative energy, and we are here pushing for an alternative to the president. We are going to get a new president."" Romney also responded to the 17-minute video that Obama's campaign released Thursday night and offered director David Guggenheim some advice. ""I'll give you some help, Mr. Guggenheim. You can make a call to some of the moms that are having a hard time paying for gas as they get their kids to and from school and practice and music lessons. You can also talk to people who are having a hard time getting to and from work, given the price of gasoline."" Romney is expected to win Puerto Rico's primary, which will award its delegates proportionally. However, if any one candidate wins a majority, he would take all 20 delegates. Asked on CNN's ""Starting Point"" whether Santorum's comments reflected a lack of understanding about Puerto Rico, the territory's Republican Gov. Luis Fortuno, who has endorsed Romney, said, ""Gov. Romney has shown respect for exactly our heritage and our history, understands it better. That's why I'm supporting Gov. Romney, because he has shown respect towards our community."" Fortuno also said Romney's economic and security message has resonated on the island. ""if we want to win the hearts and minds of Hispanic voters across America, you have to understand what Hispanic voters care about: We care about public safety, we care about location, we care about lowering taxes, on creating the proper conditions to create jobs. Mitt Romney has done that down here in Puerto Rico,"" Fortuno said. Puerto Rico's primary comes two days before the showdown in Illinois, where 66 delegates will be awarded proportionally and polls show a tight race between Romney and Santorum. Santorum's campaign was re-energized after key primary victories in the South that raised questions about conservative rival Newt Gingrich's viability as a candidate and portended a long battle with Romney. Romney, rejected again by Southern conservatives in the Tuesday primaries in Mississippi and Alabama, won caucuses in Hawaii and American Samoa to claim about a third of the total delegates available and maintain his delegate lead. However, Santorum's twin primary triumphs -- while narrow -- reframed the GOP race as a one-on-one battle between the socially conservative former Pennsylvania senator and the more moderate Romney, with Gingrich's chances fading fast. CNN's latest delegate estimates show Romney with 498 delegates to Santorums's 239. Gingrich is 100 delegates behind Santorum, and Texas Rep. Ron Paul, the libertarian champion, won 69 delegates. The Alabama and Mississippi victories gave Santorum wins in 10 states, to Romney's 18. Gingrich won the South Carolina primary in January and last week in Georgia, which he represented in Congress for 20 years. Asked Friday whether he would end his campaign should his wealthiest backer, Sheldon Adelson, urge him to do so, Gingrich insisted that he would stick it out until the very end. ""I'll be with you in Tampa,"" Gingrich said on CBS's ""This Morning,"" referring to the site of the Republican National Convention in August. Adelson, a Nevada casino mogul known for his strong support for Israel, has donated millions in recent months to Winning Our Future, a pro-Gingrich super PAC. But the former House speaker argued Friday that he has more than 175,000 online donors to consider when making a decision about his presidential run. ""They want me to stay in the race, and I really represent their interest as individuals,"" he said, adding that 95% of them have given less than $250. Asked Friday whether he thought Gingrich was hurting the Republican Party by staying in the race and shoring up delegates, Romney avoided making the case that his opponent should call it quits. ""Well, I don't know, but he certainly has every right to carry his campaign as long as he feels it has a meaningful opportunity for him to become the nominee, and he cares very deeply about the country as I do, and I wish him well,"" Romney said on Fox News. After the stop in Missouri, Santorum has two events in Illinois. He's also getting help in the form of a $310,000 ad purchase in Illinois from the Red, White and Blue Fund, a super PAC that has been supportive of his candidacy. Romney is bringing in New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to campaign for him in the state Friday. Christie, who's popular with Republicans across the country for his tough talk and tough actions in taking on Democrats in New Jersey, disappointed many in his party in October when he announced that he would not launch his own presidential bid. Instead, he endorsed Romney and has traveled to a number of primary and caucus states to stump for him. Santorum and Romney are expected to split the next few contests on the calendar. After Puerto Rico and Illinois, Santorum is expected to win in Louisiana a week from Saturday. Then the race turns north and east: The District of Columbia, Maryland and Wisconsin vote on April 3, and Romney is the early favorite. But that's three weeks away, and much has changed in such a span in the most volatile Republican race in generations.

"Washington (CNN) -- The devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina along the Mississippi coast was fresh in Haley Barbour's mind when he met with Sen. Thad Cochran and other members of the congressional delegation about aid in 2005. ""My first trip to Washington after Katrina, Senator Cochran said, 'You tell me what the state needs and I'll try to get it,'"" Barbour told CNN. ""He never deviated from that and ultimately he succeeded."" Cochran did it, Barbour and political observers said, by employing the same sort of quiet, persistence that has marked his 36-year tenure in the Senate. He worked behind the scenes, talking with colleagues, negotiating and eventually he was able to net $29 billion in relief money. He also worked across the aisle with Democrat Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana to reform the law governing federal disaster relief policies aimed at helping communities recover. Their efforts helped ensure that the victims of broad devastation, such as the type seen after Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy in 2012, could get aid for housing and rebuilding. ""In our time of greatest need, he was the giant in the delegation for Mississippi,"" Barbour said. Now, one of the longest serving lawmakers in Congress is facing a very different type of storm. Cochran is a septuagenarian facing a serious challenge from arch-conservative Chris McDaniel, a state senator who is about half his age and has the grassroots support of the tea party, the Club for Growth and Sarah Palin. The veteran lawmaker and his challenger both failed to eclipse the 50% threshold in the June 3 primary to avoid a runoff and will face off again on Tuesday. Mississippi GOP primary heads for runoff . The stakes are especially high in Mississippi as the tea party reels from Republican primary setbacks in Kentucky and other states this spring. Conservatives are hoping to oust another ""establishment"" Republican. They are buoyed by Virginia GOP primary's surprise defeat of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor by political newcomer, Dave Brat. In Mississippi, the race leading up to the runoff turned ugly. This month, police arrested political blogger Clayton Kelly after authorities said he broke into a nursing home where Cochran's wife, Rose, has lived for roughly 14 years and snapped pictures of the elderly woman which ended up in a political attack ad on YouTube, according to The Clarion-Ledger. Both Cochran and McDaniel denounced the act, but the fallout has led to accusations of dirty politics through attack ads. Blogger's arrest shakes up Mississippi Republican primary . ""I think Senator Cochran is generally viewed positively by the electorate as a whole,"" said John Bruce, chairman of the University of Mississippi's political science department. ""However, among those voters who are likely to take part in the Republican primary, his numbers are not as high."" Though the Cook Political Report and the Rothenberg Political Report both have the senate seat as remaining solidly in the Republican column, Stuart Rothenberg in April wrote: ""Cochran, 76, is in trouble â€” in deep trouble â€” primarily because of changes in the Republican Party. But it's also true that the senator, and his campaign, didn't start his re-election effort where they needed to be."" Complete Coverage: 2014 Midterm Elections . That's partly because the very thing Cochran has cited as a strength: his tenure in Washington and power broker status, has been used by his tea party backed opponent to paint him as an antiquated Beltway insider. In 2010, Citizens Against Government Waste, a non profit government spending watchdog group, dubbed Cochran the ""king of earmarks"" after he netted roughly $490 million for projects he favored. Cochran has served as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the Agriculture Committee. In this role, he was able to help net federal funding for his alma mater, the University of Mississippi, for medical research, as well as money for defense contractors and protected the interests of Mississippi farmers, Barbour said. ""He has worked hard in the state to make sure Mississippi got its fair share,"" Barbour said. Barbour's nephew, Henry, is an adviser to Mississippi Conservatives, a super PAC that is trying to get Cochran re-elected. Still, the challenge from McDaniel has Cochran on the defense, Bruce said. ""I think McDaniel's campaign is a little bit of tea party, a little bit of personal attacks, and a little bit of ambition on McDaniel's part,"" Bruce said. ""The mystery going forward is the magnitude of any impact from the photos of the senator's ailing wife."" Short-lived tea party victories? The race's tenor seems a departure for someone who, friends like Barbour said, prides himself on being ""a true gentleman."" ""He is a true gentleman. He is gracious, never says anything bad about anybody,"" Barbour said. ""He is a quiet, but very able colleague. He's always been held in very high regard by people in both parties."" Cochran's mother was a school teacher; his father was a principal. This educationally steeped environment helped shaped his core values, the lawmaker has told the media over the years. Though he was a high school football star in Hinds County, Mississippi, he decided to join the cheerleading squad at the University of Mississippi â€” an experience he credits with his first taste of politics. Key races to watch in 2014 . ""You had to go around to the different residence houses and fraternity and sorority houses and campaign, answer questions and make a little speech about why you thought you'd be a good cheerleader,"" Cochran told Roll Call in 2011. Fellow Mississippi Republican and former Sen. Trent Lott was also an Ole Miss cheerleader a few years after Cochran. Cochran followed his cheerleading stint with service in the Navy. He earned a law degree, practiced and also headed Richard Nixon's 1968 campaign in Mississippi. Cochran was elected to the House in 1972, serving three terms before moving on to the Senate. ""I think he's a pragmatic politician that understands getting a half a loaf most of the time is better than never getting anything while you hold out for a whole loaf,"" Bruce said.","Long time Mississippi senator has a tough runoff on Tuesday .

"Washington (CNN) -- Congressional leaders on Tuesday will mark the 50th anniversary of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sex or national origin. Rep. Marcia Fudge, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, will join Congress' top two Democrats and Republicans to commemorate the law and issue the Congressional Gold Medal in honor of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and his wife Coretta Scott King. The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest civilian honor awarded by Congress. President Barack Obama marked the anniversary in April, speaking at the Lyndon B. Johnson presidential library.

"(CNN) -- The blacklegged ticks are out, and they're infecting hundreds of thousands of Americans with a bacterial illness -- more often than experts previously thought. About 300,000 Americans each year are diagnosed with Lyme disease, according to new estimate released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week. That number is 10 times higher than the number of cases reported annually to the CDC. The latest estimates were presented at the 2013 International Conference on Lyme Borreliosis and Other Tick-Borne Diseases on August 18. ""This new preliminary estimate confirms that Lyme disease is a tremendous public health problem in the United States, and clearly highlights the urgent need for prevention,"" said Dr. Paul Mead, chief of epidemiology and surveillance for the CDC's Lyme disease program, in a statement. Lyme disease, which comes from a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi, is the most common illness spread by ticks in North America and Europe, according to the Mayo Clinic. Blacklegged ticks can spread such bacteria while feeding on the blood of animals and humans. Most humans are infected by immature ticks called nymphs, the CDC says, which generally feed during the spring and summer months. Ticks carrying this disease hang out in grassy and heavily wooded areas. Patients who take appropriate antibiotics early on in the disease are likely to make a full recovery, according to the Mayo Clinic. It may take longer to respond to treatment in later stages of Lyme disease, but, with appropriate treatment, most people recover completely. Why you should be afraid of Lyme disease . Symptoms . Fever, headache, fatigue and a rash called erythema migrans are all typical symptoms of Lyme disease. This rash often resembles a bull's eye and can appear within a few days of infection. Between 70% and 80% of people with Lyme disease develop this rash, and some patients develop it at more than one location on their bodies. Left untreated, the Lyme disease infection can spread to the joints, heart and nervous system, according to the CDC. This can lead to joint pain and swelling. After several weeks to months, patients may also experience swelling of the membranes surrounding the brain, temporary paralysis of one side of the face and ""brain fog"": forgetfulness or confusion. What to do if you get bitten . Ticks can be tiny: Deer ticks may be as small as the head of a pin, so look for them carefully. Removing a tick within 24 hours cuts your risk of developing Lyme disease because it takes time for the bacteria to move from the tick to the host. The longer the tick is attached to the human body, the more likely that person will be infected. Use tweezers to carefully and steadily pull the tick off, grasping near its mouth or neck. Then put antiseptic on the infected area. Contact your doctor immediately if you've been bitten by a tick and start to experience symptoms. Even if your symptoms disappear, you should still see a doctor. Treatment . The standard treatment for Lyme disease in early stages is oral antibiotics. Usually, a 14- to 21-day course is recommended, but some studies suggest that a 10- to 14-day course is equally effective, according to the Mayo Clinic. If the central nervous system has been affected by the disease, intravenous antibiotics may be given for 14 to 28 days. This treatment eliminates the infection, but you may need more time to recover from symptoms. The side effects from this treatment may include a lower white blood cell count, diarrhea or infection with other organisms resistant to antibiotics that are unrelated to Lyme disease. Prevention . The CDC recommends wearing insect repellent with at least a 20% DEET concentration and avoiding wooded areas with high grass areas where ticks are most often found. It also suggests checking for ticks daily and showering soon after being outdoors. Using a washcloth while bathing may remove any unattached ticks lingering on the skin. Covering yourself outdoors can also help: Wear shoes, long pants, long-sleeved shirt, hat and gloves in wooded or grassy areas, says the Mayo Clinic. Your pets can also bring ticks into the house, so check them regularly. More facts about ticks . These arachnids can't fly or jump but rather wait for a host -- whether it be a mammal, bird, reptile or amphibian -- to feed on while resting on the tips of grasses and shrubs. They hold on to leaves and grass with their lower legs, a position called ""questing."" As the host passes by, the tick climbs on and finds a place to bite. Besides Lyme disease, ticks can also transmit other illnesses such as babesiosis and Colorado tick fever. Make it your quest to stay safe. Buzz off, bugs!

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Justice Department Tuesday said its prosecutors are assisting the State Department Inspector General in the investigation into the breaching of passport files of the three leading presidential candidates by State Department contractors. The passport files of Sens. Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and John McCain were improperly accessed. The involvement of its lawyers appears to be a shift in the Justice Department's position since Friday, when Attorney General Michael Mukasey said he wouldn't join the investigation until the State Department inspector general requested assistance. In the event someone walked into the Justice Department ""with a box full of evidence,"" Mukasey said Friday, that could change his stance. The State Department confirmed last week that contract personnel had accessed Sen. Barack Obama's file on three occasions, and had made unauthorized entry once each into the passport files of Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. John McCain. Obama and Clinton are competing to be the Democratic nominee for president. McCain is the likely Republican nominee.

Watch more on the passport breach » . He said the department would have no further comment. The State Department initiated the contact and a follow-up meeting with Justice prosecutors sometime after Mukasey spoke, according to a knowledgeable official who asked not to be identified because of the pending investigation. The official said the guidance requested by State officials does not constitute what could be described as a ""joint investigation"" by the two departments.

The latest such call came Tuesday from the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, and the panel's ranking Republican, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. ""The Justice Department should not wait to be handed 'a box full of evidence' as you said at your recent briefing, before determining whether federal laws were broken,"" Leahy and Specter said in a joint letter to Mukasey.

"(CNN) -- Most American states are doing a subpar job in protecting against corruption and assuring accountability, according a study released Monday. The joint report -- from the Global Integrity nonprofit advocacy group, Public Radio International and Center for Public Integrity investigative news organization -- used data on a host of measures to score all 50 states. No state received an A grade, while five got Bs and 19 were given Cs. The majority got grades that would be considered not passing in American schools, including 18 Ds and eight with failing grades. ""What's behind the dismal grades? Across the board, state ethics, open records and disclosure laws lack one key feature: teeth,"" said an overview of the report written by Caitlin Ginley from the Center for Public Integrity. The report assessed 330 ""Corruption Risk Indicators"" across 14 aspects of government such as ethics enforcement, lobbying disclosure, auditing practices and executive, legislative and judicial accountability. The top-ranked state, after an analysis of these measures, was New Jersey. It got a score of 87, equivalent to a B+. It was followed closely by Connecticut. The only three other states earned above-average scores of B- or better: Washington, California and Nebraska. On the other end of the spectrum was Georgia, which ranked at the bottom of the report's rankings when it came to transparency and accountability. Citing one reason for Georgia's failing grade, the report claimed ""more than 650 government employees accepted gifts from vendors doing business with the state in 2007 and 2008"" despite this being a clear violation of state ethics laws -- adding that the state hadn't issued a related penalty since 1999. The Peach State wasn't alone in scoring an F. It was joined by South Dakota, Wyoming, Virginia, Maine, South Carolina, North Dakota and Michigan. The report's overview notes that low grades in some sparsely populated Western or Plains states may be attributable to ""libertarian roots, a small-town, neighborly approach and the honest belief that 'everybody knows everybody' (that) has overridden any perceived need for strong protections in law."" But overall, the study concludes that many failings are preventable, whether by giving more power to ethics boards, bolstering penalties, increasing openness and transparency, or taking stronger measures to decrease the influence of money in politics. This is despite some public steps in recent years aimed ostensibly at fighting corruption. ""State officials make lofty promises when it comes to ethics in government. They tout transparency of legislative processes, accessibility of records and the openness of public meetings. But these efforts often fall short of providing any real transparency or legitimate hope of rooting out corruption,"" wrote Ginley. The report offers a number of examples. One is former West Virginia Gov. Arch Moore, in office for three terms in the 1970s and 1980s, who went to a local dealership and took a car on a ""test drive"" and ended up keeping it for four years, while the dealership earned state contracts. Then, the report references a North Carolina legislator who owned five billboards and sponsored a bill to loosen billboard construction regulations, with an ethics commission finding no violations. And it also faults a Tennessee ethics commission that hasn't issued a penalty in its six years in existence and that doesn't make complaints available to the public. Scandals and a history of political corruption can be prime drivers of effective reforms, according to the report, which points to the positive measures taken in New Jersey, Illinois and Louisiana. It also credits widespread improvements in transparency, in which legislation and ""some government records are easier to retrieve than ever."" But Ed Bender of the National Institute on Money in State Politics says in the report that such information often isn't presented in an easy-to-use, easy-to-understand format. Ginley, in the report's overview, also claims the study found that ""lobbyists find ways"" around even retooled laws and that ""across the board, enforcement is weak."" ""When it comes to money, influence and power in state government, interest groups and big-money donors will find ways around just about any limit,"" she wrote.","A joint study assesses U.S. states on corruption, accountability and transparency .

"(CNN) -- After two years of debate, the constitutional challenges to President Barack Obama's health care law finally reached the U.S. Supreme Court this week. While the intensity of the debate suggests the law is vulnerable to being overturned, 70 years of judicial precedents provide strong grounds for upholding the law. On Monday, the opening day of oral arguments did little to address the core constitutional questions. Rather, the nine justices were asked to consider whether an arcane rule of tax law would require the court to postpone its decision on the constitutionality of the individual mandate to purchase health care. Under a federal statute, people cannot challenge a tax until the Internal Revenue Service tries to collect it. According to this line of reasoning, people who object to the individual mandate are objecting to the tax that they will have to pay if they do not purchase insurance. Since no one will have to pay a penalty until 2015, one of the courts of appeals had dismissed the constitutional challenge. However, there was little sentiment among the justices to postpone a decision until 2015. The only real uncertainty is how they will explain why the appellate court was wrong. Is it because the penalty for not purchasing insurance is not a ""tax""? Is it because the government wants the case to go forward and can permit people to challenge a tax even before it is imposed? There's another tax argument that the court is likely to reject based on clues given on the first day. The government is claiming that the individual mandate is authorized by the power of Congress to tax Americans. The justices seemed skeptical about this point. Justice Stephen Breyer, for example, expressed doubt that the penalty for not purchasing insurance could be viewed as a tax. And none of the lower courts have bought the taxing power argument. On Day Two, the government's more important constitutional argument will be brought up. The government will make a case that the individual mandate is authorized by the power of Congress to regulate commerce. Based on their past statements, the four liberal-leaning justices on the court are expected to agree. Legal experts therefore will pay close attention to the questions asked by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia for signs on their views about the commerce power. Critics of the health care law say the commerce power allows Congress to regulate people who are voluntarily engaged in economic transactions, but Congress cannot require people to buy a good or service solely because they are living in the United States. The government will respond that under the new health care law, insurers no longer will be able to deny people affordable coverage because they have had a heart attack, cancer diagnosis or other medical problem. Starting in 2014, ""pre-existing medical conditions"" cannot serve as a basis for raising premiums or refusing to offer insurance. And there is no question that the commerce power permits this new rule. But there is a cost to protecting the public from pre-existing conditions fees. Insurers can be asked to charge the same rates for everyone only if the public is required to purchase coverage. Otherwise, many people would wait until they suffer an illness or injury to buy their policy. In other words, the individual mandate is simply designed to prevent freeloading that would cause the pre-existing conditions provision to fail, and the Constitution gives Congress the power to make sure its laws can be implemented effectively. For argument, the government will cite the court's medical marijuana decision, and it will be interesting to see how Scalia discusses his position in that case. There, he sided with the majority in recognizing a broad federal power to regulate commerce, even when an individual is cultivating marijuana for personal medical use and not for any commercial purposes. If Congress can apply its drug laws to someone not engaged in any commercial activity, why can't it apply its health care laws to someone not engaged in any commercial activity? Expect the justices to ask about the implications of individual mandate for future laws. If Congress can make people buy health care insurance, can it also make people purchase other products, such as broccoli? The answer is no. Insurance is different from all other products. If Congress wants to improve people's diets, it can require dairies to add vitamin D to their milk or bakers to add fiber to their bread. The government can regulate the food we eat by regulating our voluntary transactions. There is no need to force us to go out and buy foods we don't want to buy. Opponents of the health care law make arguments that sound plausible and that once reflected the constitutional interpretations of the Supreme Court. But decisions since the 1940s provide ample support for the court to uphold the law. How the justices will ultimately rule, it's hard to say. But Tuesday's hearings should tell us more about their inclinations. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Orentlicher.","Oral arguments on the Affordable Care Act have begun before the high court .

"Washington (CNN) -- As the Republican primary reaches its halfway point, the question of inevitability is a main topic of conversation. Is former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who holds a sizable lead in delegates, destined to be the Republican nominee for president in 2012? While Romney's campaign says yes, his three rivals argue otherwise. Mathematically, former Sen. Rick Santorum, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Rep. Ron Paul all still have a chance to win the nomination. But the odds are quickly stacking against each one of them. One mishap now could cost them the chance of an outright win before the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida. How to win the nomination . Every primary contest comes down to one thing: amassing as many delegates as possible. These delegates are elected to go to the national convention, where they will officially nominate the candidate to represent the Republican Party in the general election against President Barack Obama. It takes 1,144 delegates to win the GOP nomination. As of Monday, CNN estimates that Romney has 519 delegates, Santorum has 239, Gingrich has 138, and Paul has 69. Delegates are allocated based on primary and caucus results, per the state Republican Party's rules. The rules differ from state to state, but most are approved by the Republican National Committee. Some states have a one-day primary, some have a multistep caucus system, and others have a mix of the two. New Hampshire, South Carolina, Florida, Michigan and Arizona were penalized for moving their primaries outside the window authorized by the national committee. The road to 1,144 . Romney's delegate total puts the odds in his favor. CNN estimates that there are 1,290 delegates up for grabs, meaning Romney would need 49% of the remaining delegates to win the nomination. His plan: Stay the course. ""We're going to the convention with more than 1,144 delegates,"" said Rich Beeson, Romney's political director. ""We're going to do what we've always done. We've had a plan since day one."" Contests in Illinois, Maryland, Wisconsin and Washington appear to favor Romney. But the way the rules read, most delegates are awarded in a proportional manner, making it almost impossible for one candidate to win them all in one contest. There are some contests remaining in which delegates are winner-take-all: Washington, Delaware, New Jersey and Utah. That does not mean Santorum can't catch up. He needs 70% of the remaining delegates to win the nomination before the convention. Santorum's focus: the May contests. ""We believe that May 8th is the beginning of the end for Mitt Romney and the date that puts Rick Santorum on a path to the nomination,"" John Patrick Yob, a Santorum strategist, wrote in a recent campaign memo. North Carolina, Indiana and West Virginia vote that day; a win in all three could be pivotal to changing the momentum of the race. Santorum isn't the only one looking ahead to May. The Gingrich campaign believes those and other May contests such as Arkansas, Kentucky and Texas will be fertile ground for delegates as well. The 152 delegates at stake in Texas could be a boon for all the candidates. Gingrich has the endorsement of Gov. Rick Perry, who unsuccessfully sought the GOP presidential nomination. Expect Gingrich to lean on Perry when the primary turns to Texas. ""With 4 candidates remaining, the GOP nomination now moves into unchartered waters with history in the making,"" wrote Randy Evans, senior adviser, and Martin Baker, political director to Gingrich, in a recent campaign memo. ""The sequencing and pace of the second half favors Newt."" For Gingrich and Paul, the numbers are more difficult. They need 78% and 83% of the remaining delegates, respectively, to earn the nomination. Paul's plan: unpledged delegates. Delegates: Pledged, unplugged and the power to switch . Not all delegates are the same. ""Pledged"" delegates are required to vote for the candidate based on the results of their state's contests. ""Unpledged"" delegates are allowed to vote for any candidate they choose, regardless of the results in their state. For Paul, this could mean picking up delegates in states that have already held their first round of voting. In many caucus states, the first round usually has a nonbinding presidential straw poll and an election of delegates to another local convention. These delegates then go to a county, congressional district or state convention. At this second-stage convention, which could occur months after the initial vote, the actual delegates for Tampa are selected. The process varies from state to state. In some states such as Iowa, delegate selections are done at different events. Congressional district delegates are elected at the district conventions, while at-large delegates are elected at the state convention. This is where the Paul campaign sees an opening. The congressman is counting on his strong grass-roots organization to help him pick up delegates at these local conventions. ""Our campaign has continued to follow up and work the delegate selection processes in the states where contests have already been held, and we plan to work hard to collect delegates in upcoming states where the awarding of delegates is proportional,"" Gary Howard, Paul's national press secretary, said in a statement. ""No one can afford to think too far ahead right now, it is still a wide open race so our campaign will continue to hunt for as many delegates as we can gain up until the convention."" Most of the delegate-selecting conventions in caucus states have yet to take place. In Wyoming, Paul did see a loss of a couple of delegates between the first straw poll and the county conventions. His supporters will have to rally stronger to make sure he maintains -- if not picks up -- delegates. Unpledged delegates can also change their minds and vote for a different candidate. This is why it is extremely important for campaigns to have strong organization to try and pick up new delegates, while making sure they hold on to unpledged delegates who expressed support. ""The accumulation concept is analogous to attaining one's GPA -- harder to bring up than to start up -- so is the delegate horse trading,"" said Mary Matalin, a former campaign adviser for George H.W. Bush. ""If you don't have good solid, 'political' ones and full slates from the get-go, it's harder, if even possible, to move them around."" The three most important delegates . Unpledged delegates will sometimes follow three key members of their state's delegation: the party chair and the two national committee members. Except in states where they've lost their vote due to a penalty, these three members are part of every voting delegation at the convention. The three members are leaders in the party and often have contact and influence with the campaigns and their state's delegation. If the convention is brokered, they can advise delegates on possibly switching their vote on a second or third ballot. ""They become magnifying forces for other unpledged or second ballot switchers,"" Matalin said. Most pledged delegates are bound only on the first vote, making it crucial for any candidate who does not want a floor fight at the convention to lock up their delegates ahead of time. The three committee members can help accomplish that. While a brokered convention might not seem like a pressing issue, Republican leaders will want to avoid the chaos. It takes to time prepare to run a national campaign, which the winning candidate won't have if the nomination isn't decided until late August in Tampa. If you're a Republican national delegate, that's the last thing you want, for one important reason. ""Essentially, what they're saying is that 'we have a nominee with 60 days to go against Obama, the most funded president in American history,' "" said Beeson, Romney's political director. ""My guess is, if you're a delegate to the RNC, you want to beat Barack Obama, and this is not how you're going to do it."" CNN Political Research Director Robert Yoon contributed to this report.","It takes 1,144 delegates to win the GOP nomination .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal's ""King of Clay"" crown may have slipped a little this year, but the world No. 1 is not giving up his reign without a fight. Having suffered shock quarterfinal defeats in his former strongholds of Monte Carlo and Barcelona, the Spanish tennis star rallied to retain his Madrid title -- and on Friday he battled back from the brink of defeat in Rome to reach the semifinals. Two-time defending champion Nadal overcame Andy Murray in three sets, having been thrashed in the opener and then trailed 4-2 in the decider before prevailing 1-6 3-6 7-5 in two hours and 40 minutes. As a measure of his recent struggles, it was the first time since 2005 that Nadal had been taken the distance in three consecutive matches on his favorite surface at the same tournament. Murray, seeking to regain the form that took him to second in the rankings, had been poised for his first win over Nadal on clay but the seventh-seeded Brit ultimately failed to press home his advantage. Nadal, seeking his eighth title in the Italian capital, will next face Grigor Dmitrov on Saturday. The 14th-ranked Bulgarian celebrated his 23rd birthday with easy passage against German veteran Tommy Haas, who retired with a shoulder injury after losing the first set 6-2. ""I'm just a happy birthday birth today,"" said Dimitrov, who received a cake in the face after the match courtesy of his coach. World No. 2 Novak Djokovic also battled into the semifinals, beating Nadal's Monte Carlo conqueror David Ferrer 7-5 4-6 6-3 in two hours 32 minutes. ""It was the most physical match I had on clay this year,"" said the Serbian, who will next play Canada's Milos Raonic. The eighth seed was also taken to three sets by Frenchman Jeremy Chardy -- who upset Roger Federer on Wednesday -- before triumphing 6-3 5-7 6-2. In the women's draw, world No. 1 Serena Williams set up a semifinal with former top-ranked Serbian Ana Ivanovic. The American defending champion defeated China's Shuai Zhang 6-1 6-3, while 11th seed Ivanovic followed up her win over two-time Rome winner Maria Sharapova by beating Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro 6-4 3-6 6-4. Ivanovic's only win over 17-time grand slam champion Williams came at January's Australian Open, but the 2008 French Open winner then lost to young Canadian Eugenie Bouchard in the quarterfinals. World No. 2 Li Na suffered a 6-3 4-6 6-2 loss against Italy's 2012 French Open runner-up Sara Errani, who will next play Jelena Jankovic in her home event. Ivanovic's compatriot, also a former No. 1, upset Polish third seed Agnieszka Radwanska 6-4 6-4 to give herself a chance of reaching the final for the third time. Jankovic, still seeking her first grand slam title, was Rome champion in 2007-08 and losing finalist in 2010.","Defending champion Rafael Nadal wins through to semifinals of Rome Masters .

"(CNN) -- Should the world's best video game players -- those who earn six figures and play professionally -- be considered athletes? Are they on par with Olympians? People who read CNN's recent story on pro gaming and gaming addiction in South Korea raised these questions in comments threads, on Twitter and over e-mail. Many criticized CNN for highlighting the dark side of video gaming in that country, instead of celebrating the achievements of the world's best e-sports athletes. Specifically at issue was the story of MarineKing, one of the world's best ""StarCraft II"" players who, in the past, worried his parents and teachers because he practiced sometimes for 20 hours a day. They flagged him as a potential gaming ""addict,"" but his parents now support his quest to be the world's best at the strategy game he loves. Furthermore, they regret having pushed back against their son's passion. How do you draw the line between obsessive, unhealthy behavior and a drive to be the world's best? Should pro gamers (or chess players, for that matter) be put in the same class as track-and-field stars and gymnasts, who also go to extreme lengths to get in shape for competition? Many pro gamers in South Korea, for example, are required to run, swim and lift weights as part of their training. Here's a look at what some of you had to say. Comments may be edited for brevity and clarity: . On the training schedules of pro gamers vs Olympians: . ""Would you claim that Phelps is addicted to swimming? Simply because someone works hard at something that is not what you view as a traditional sport does not mean their work is not real, and difficult. I dare you to compare top e-sport athlete's training regimens to top Olympic athletes training regimens. I wouldn't be surprised in the least if their schedules were similar."" -- Justin Ahn, 22, from Waterloo, Ontario . On MarineKing as an athlete: . ""To me, MKP (MarineKing) represents many things. He represents dedication and skill and perseverance. He is one of the best in the world at one of the most difficult endeavors that has ever existed and he is beloved by his fans for good reason.Â To mention him in the same breath as something bizarre like addiction is to belittle everything he has worked for and everything we as a community value."" -- Twitter user @kevinflo, over e-mail . On passion/love vs. addiction: . ""They make money doing something they love, which takes hard work, perseverance and sacrifice. What a terrible addiction."" -- CNN commenter ""Shivy Deo"" On when that passion goes too far: . ""We all know that most pro gamers started because they became addicted to gaming, not because they played every now and then. And it was their addiction and their willingness to spend most of their time in front of a computer that made them so good and eligible to become pros. Also, it's not because you make money doing something that makes it OK (just look at gambling). You can rationalize it as much as you want but an addiction is an addiction, period. It means that your life is not balanced and therefore it means you have a problem. Are there other (more conventional) professions in the world like that? Of course there are. But two wrongs don't make one right."" -- CNN commenter ""diiggas"" On the skill required to be a pro gamer: . ""This article did not truly distinguish the difference between game addiction and professional gaming or even gaming as a hobby. I do no(t) believe the article shows the amount of skill needed to be one of the best in the world or how truly big professional gaming has become."" -- Justin Pringle, 24, from Augusta, GeorgiaÂ . On ""physicality"" being an important part of athletics: . ""I wouldn't call them athletes. The one common denominator with all Olympians is the physicality involved. Even the word athlete refers to physical activity. I have no issues with video gaming, but the Olympics just seems to be the wrong venue."" -- CNN commenter ""t0of1y"" On video games as physical challenges: .

"(CNN) -- Another day, another toll in Syria's civil war: 213 dead. For many around the world, the story of the fighting in Syria is a near daily listing of casualty figures that represent the devastation of war. For those on the ground, it's the reality of nearly two years of fighting with no end in sight. It's that reality the country's principal opposition group says led it to suspend its participation in next week's meeting in Rome of the Friends of Syria -- an international conference of diplomats from more than 60 nations working to bring about an end to the violence. ""Enough is enough. The whole world is not doing anything,"" Adib Shishakly, a member of the Syrian National Coalition, told CNN on Friday. ""We are not going to any more conferences."" In a statement released Friday, the coalition said it also would not accept upcoming invitations to meetings in Washington and Moscow. What's next? The war in Syria began in March 2011 when President Bashar al-Assad's government brutally cracked down on protesters, partly inspired by Arab Spring uprisings in the region, calling for political freedoms. The protest movement quickly devolved into an armed conflict along somewhat sectarian lines between majority Sunnis and al-Assad's minority-Alawite dominated government. Alawites are an offshoot of Shiite Islam. World leaders have been hard pressed to end the fighting with the U.N. Security Council hopelessly deadlocked amid concern the violence could spill over into neighboring countries and destabilize the region. The United States, the European Union and the Arab League -- the backbone of the Friends of Syria -- have supplied aid to rebels in the form of communications equipment and humanitarian aid. The rebels want more, specifically military aid in the form of arms and training. ""We want the U.S. to help the people on the ground,"" Shishakly said. But countries have stopped short of providing military aid as many did to Libyan rebels over concerns about the unity of the fractious Syrian opposition. Concerns also have been raised about rebel ties to an al Qaeda affiliate, the al-Nusra Front, and other militant groups. Counterproductive move? The news that the National Coalition was pulling out of the meeting came as a surprise to the United States where at least one senior U.S. official warned the move would be counterproductive. The meeting will provide the opposition its first opportunity to meet with new U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The coalition did not notify the United States ahead of its decision, said the official, who was not authorized to release the information. Britain urged the coalition to reconsider its move. ""It is important to have Coalition participation, and we strongly urge members to help win the arguments for achieving more support for the Opposition. The Coalition is making progress; it is not easy, but now is not the time to give up,"" the Foreign Office said in a statement. The National Coalition, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with plans to create a transitional government despite al-Assad's refusal to cede power. A head of the interim government will be named within 10 days, according to a statement released Friday by the group at the conclusion of a two-day meeting in Cairo. See-saw battles . The announcement by the coalition comes as see-saw battles between government forces and rebels have reached a near draw in the civil war, with neither side gaining ground in recent months. The fighting has spilled from the countryside into city centers, with rebels and government forces reportedly clashing in the capital city of Damascus as well the country's largest city of Aleppo. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said 213 people killed in fighting across the country Friday. Of the casualties, 92 were killed in the opposition stronghold of Aleppo, according to the group. CNN cannot confirm casualties as access to the country has been severely restricted. The deaths in Aleppo, according to the opposition, occurred when Scud missiles were fired Friday by government forces at rebel strongholds in predominantly residential neighborhoods. The missile attack came a day after a series of car bombs targeted government buildings in the capital city of Damascus, including the headquarters of al-Assad's ruling party, and left at least 53 people dead and more than 230 wounded. The United Nations recently estimated 70,000 people died in the fighting in Syria.

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. A man from Honduras reads in an ""English As A Second Language"" class in Miami, Florida. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2006 American Community Survey, approximately 80 percent -- or 223.2 million people -- of Americans use only English at home. The remaining 20 percent -- 55.8 million people -- speak a language other than English. Add the millions of tourists visiting the country each year and you have a huge demand for workers who can communicate in more than one language. Thankfully, bilingual workers come to the rescue. In almost every line of work the ability to speak a second language makes you a valuable asset. Any job that requires you to interact with customers -- either in person, on the phone or online -- can use your knowledge of a second (or third) language. Think about it: Every additional customer you can speak with not only improves his or her experience but also brings in revenue to your employer. The states with the largest percentage of citizens speaking a language other than English at home are California, New Mexico, Texas, New York and Arizona. Spanish is by far the most popular non-English language spoken at home with roughly 34 million speakers nationwide. Still, there are millions of people speaking other languages -- including French, German, Mandarin, Arabic and lesser known languages -- that also benefit from bilingual workers. If you speak more than one language or have thought about learning a second one, here are some industries and jobs where your skills will come in handy. Industry: Health care  Why: Patients visiting emergency rooms and doctor's offices come from all walks of life. In fact, America's reputation as a leader in medicine attracts people from around the world, so you never know what language you'll hear when someone walks through the door. Jobs: Registered nurse, paramedic, physician's assistant, home health aide . Industry: Hospitality  Why: Spas, resorts and hotels help visitors escape their daily routine and makes them feel like royalty. Creating a little bit of paradise -- for a tourist or a local just trying to get away -- is easier when you can understand what your client is saying to you. Jobs: Concierge, resort manager, hotel manager, desk clerk . Industry: Education  Why: One of the richer aspects of an American education is the exposure to different cultures. You can walk into most classrooms, from kindergarten through graduate levels, and find students who come from multilingual households or who are studying abroad. Jobs: Teacher, ESL instructor, guidance counselor . Industry: Law enforcement  Why: Among the many duties of law enforcement personnel is interviewing people, either to solve crimes or to understand what's happening in a conflict. You can save a lot of time (and maybe even a life) if you don't have to wait for an interpreter. Jobs: Police officer, investigator, security guard, probation officer, corrections officer . Industry: Customer service  Why: Every aspect of customer service involves dealing with people. Depending on where you work, you might have customers who are tourists or who come from households where English isn't spoken. Knowing more than one language means you can communicate to a larger amount of visitors, which both your employer and customers will appreciate. Jobs: Sales clerk, demonstrator, retail store supervisor, computer support specialist, customer service representative . Industry: Social services  Why: Social service workers meet with families, adoption agencies and schools in order to ensure the well-being of children. The fewer language barriers between the worker, children and important people in their environment, the smoother things can run. Jobs: Family social worker, substance abuse social worker, social work administration . Industry: Finance Why: Money doesn't only stay on one continent, so in the world of finance, whether you're a teller or the CEO of an investment bank, you're dealing with euros and yen and the languages that come with them. Jobs: Teller, financial adviser, investment banker, accountant . Industry: Communication  Why: Whether your job is talking to the media or writing for a publication, words are your livelihood. The more you know, the better you can do your job. Whether it enables you to speak to a reporter or interview a source for a story, being bilingual makes your job easier.

"(CNN) -- The Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibiilty for two explosions Thursday at a shrine in Karachi in which at least eight people were killed and dozens injured. The suicide attack was launched at the shrine of a revered Sufi Muslim saint, Abdullah Shah Ghazi, said Zulfiqar Ali Mirza, interior minister of Sindh province. Mirza has ordered the closing of Karachi shrines until further notice. Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, is located in Sindh province. Saghir Ahmed, Sindh's health minister, told CNN that the victims have been brought to hospitals in Karachi and 60 people are being treated for injuries. Authorities said crews were sifting through human remains at the site. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack. ""The relentless attacks on ordinary Pakistani citizens by those who want to impose an extremist mindset and lifestyle upon our country will not deter our government and the Pakistan Peoples Party,"" a statement from Zardari's office said. ""We remain committed to fighting these murderers and expelling them from our land."" The attack occurred Thursday night, the busiest time at the shrine because it's the eve of Muslim Friday prayers. Karachi and Sindh residents make pilgrimages to the shrine to offer prayers.

"(CNN) -- The recession in Europe is entering its fifth year and unemployment doesn't look like it will be returning to normal levels anytime soon. In the countries with debt problems, especially Greece and Spain, unemployment skyrocketed in the last couple of years and is now at unprecedented levels. One in two young workers is out of a job. Are we losing a whole new generation of young workers? Are we wasting hard-earned skills? Some countries are actually doing better than in previous recessions. For instance, unemployment in Germany and the Netherlands is no longer a big problem. But the countries that are doing better tend also to be the countries whose sound fiscal finances allowed them to avoid a deep recession. It is clear unemployment will not recover fully before the debt crisis is over and Europe's economy improves. Read more: Portuguese head to Mozambique to escape eurozone crisis . The fiscal consolidation programs, although necessary in the long term, are making the unemployment problem worse -- and policy is needed to offset their impact on jobs. The policies needed to combat unemployment go against the thrust of fiscal consolidation; it is not only an economic problem but a serious social problem. Read more: Spain braces for protests as budget cuts are unveiled . Deep recession and high unemployment tear into the fabric of society. Unemployment causes misery to families, destroys their self-esteem and wastes their potential. It is both a waste and a regression. Jobless youth often feel rejected by society, and react either by withdrawing, by wasting themselves or by lashing out violently, as we have already seen in some southern countries. Spending money on policies that can combat the problem until the economy recovers is a good investment in the future of our societies. Read more: Greece: When anger goes beyond despair . It is a better investment than building a new road or airport. The road construction can be postponed without lasting damage to the project; a job cannot be postponed without lasting damage to the person. Read more: Could derelict airport be Greece's economic savior? For the young, excluding the education and training budget from the fiscal consolidation programs is essential. I would go further during recession and stress the importance of increasing spending on training and job subsidies for new job creation. Two measures that helped Germany keep youth unemployment low are apprentice training and subsidized employment for young people, including self-employment. There is a lot of creativity and entrepreneurship in young people that can be unleashed if initial financing can be found. Governments can help in this, just as they help with student loans. I am in favor of extending the student loan scheme to start-ups by young people, subject to approval of the start-up by the appropriate government department. In recession the government should become the ""angel"" of young entrepreneurs. Read more: Why Hollande must show clearer leadership . Unfortunately if left alone employers will not create enough jobs in recession to keep unemployment low. Of course, to some this is the essence of recession but the jobless rate depends also on many other factors, not just on the fall in demand. Just as government should help reduce the impact of recession on unemployment through programs, workers and their unions should be prepared to take pay cuts and share out work in recession. The alternative is much worse: it shifts the burden of recession onto the few who have been unfortunate enough to lose their jobs. It is appalling to hear sometimes that even in recession there are people who earn overtime wages. Work should be shared out, even if it means lower pay for those who would have kept their jobs.","Germany keep youth unemployment low by apprentices and subsidized employment, writes Pissarides .

"(CNN) -- A 36-year-old crew member on a Disney Cruise Line ship was arrested in a Florida port on Thursday on suspicion of molestation and false imprisonment, officials said. Disney said it notified police about an incident that was alleged to have occurred Thursday morning while the ship was at Port Canaveral. Canaveral Port Authority Police said Ahmed Sofyan faces two charges of lewd or lascivious molestation and one charge of false imprisonment.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Saudi Arabia's foreign minister expressed concern Monday over Iran's nuclear ambitions during a meeting between the two leaders. At the meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal called on Iran ""to respond to efforts to remove regional and international suspicions toward its nuclear program"" and stressed his country's desire for a region ""free of weapons of mass destruction, most notably nuclear weapons."" Clinton called Iran's recent announcement that it will start to produce higher-grade enriched uranium, ""a provocative move in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions"" and warned that the ""increasingly disturbing and destabilizing actions"" by Iran ""will result in increasing isolation."" Clinton's comments came hours after she told a town hall meeting in Doha, Qatar, that the United States believes Iran ""is moving toward a military dictatorship."" Clinton was responding to a question about whether the United States was getting ready for military action in Iran. ""No, we are planning to bring the world community together in applying pressure to Iran through sanctions adopted by the United Nations that will be particularly aimed at those enterprises controlled by the Revolutionary Guard, which we believe is, in effect, supplanting the government of Iran,"" Clinton said. ""We see that the government of Iran, the supreme leader, the president, the parliament, is being supplanted, and that Iran is moving toward a military dictatorship. Now, that is our view."" The tough comments on Iran came during Clinton's four-day trip to the Middle East. A day earlier, Clinton called for stronger actions against Iran in the wake of its announcement that it is stepping up production of highly enriched uranium. ""Iran leaves the international community little choice but to impose greater costs for its provocative steps,"" she said. ""Together, we are encouraging Iran to reconsider its dangerous policy decisions."" Speaking at the U.S.-Islamic World Forum, Clinton said the United States is ""working actively"" with its partners ""to prepare and implement new measures to convince Iran to change its course."" Iran already faces U.N. sanctions. The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- the United States, Britain, Russia, China and France, all of which have veto power -- have been engaged along with Germany in discussions about possible further sanctions. While Clinton was in Qatar, Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, arrived in Israel Sunday evening to meet with that nation's top military officials, including Minister of Defense Ehud Barak. ""Right now, diplomatic efforts continue,"" Mullen said, according to the Israel Defense Forces Web site. ""The option to attack Iran is still on the table, but we're not there yet."" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said Israel ""must be wiped off the map"" politically. The United States has had to assure Israel that its interests will be protected to keep its military on the sidelines. ""Conflict with Iran would be a big problem for everyone,"" Mullen said. ""I worry about the unintended consequences of an attack. While every situation has limits, we're not there yet. The diplomatic efforts must be exhausted until the end."" Iran said last week that it had completed its first batch of 20 percent enriched uranium and will soon triple production. Uranium enriched to 20 percent can set off a nuclear reaction, scientists say, but is not weapons grade. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley told CNN Monday that the United States, France and Russia recently sent a joint letter to International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Yukiya Amano challenging Iran's decision to enrich uranium to 20 percent and emphasizing other options available to Iran so it would not need to increase enrichment. ""We referred back to the Tehran research reactor proposal from last fall that Iran has yet to accept and we alluded to the availability of medical isotopes on the international market,"" Crowley said. ""Given these two legitimate and immediately available options, there is no rationale for Iran to attempt to produce its own fuel."" Asked about comments made Monday by the director of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi, to the semiofficial Fars News Agency that Iran would be prepared to stop its 20 percent enrichment, Crowley encouraged Iran to bring its ideas to the table. ""If they have ideas on how to enact the Tehran research reactor proposal, they should bring them to the IAEA and we can have another round of talks,"" Crowley said. ""Within the parameters of the Tehran research reactor proposal, we are happy to discuss effective ways of implementing it. Our problem is that we had one meeting on the issue and Iran has yet to come back to the table."" The Islamic republic insists its nuclear program is solely for peaceful civilian purposes. ""But Iran has consistently failed to live up to its responsibilities. It has refused to demonstrate to the international community that its nuclear program is entirely peaceful,"" Clinton said. ""And last year, the world learned of a secret nuclear facility near the city of Qom."" The country could get the enriched uranium that it says it wants for medical research by accepting a proposal under which Iran would ship its uranium abroad to be enriched and then returned, but Iran has rejected that offer, Clinton said. ""This has only deepened the international community's doubts about Iran's nuclear intentions, along with the Iranian government's own isolation."" Iran has also refused recent diplomatic efforts to reach a resolution, she said. A soon-to-be released U.S. assessment of Iran's nuclear program is expected to conclude the government has resumed limited work on a nuclear weapon, according to a U.S. official. CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Hillary Clinton calls trend of greater military lock on leadership disturbing .

"(CNN) -- Today marks one year since a tragic fire at the Tazreen Fashions factory in Bangladesh killed 112 workers. When the fire alarms went off that day, managers acted with indifference and forced workers to stay at their stations. Months later, devastation again struck Bangladesh's workers when the Rana Plaza building collapsed, killing 1,131. Inspectors had declared the building unsafe, yet management compelled the workers to enter with threats of lost pay or termination. These twin tragedies galvanized world attention on the terrible conditions under which Bangladeshi workers produce over $20 billion worth of clothing for consumers abroad each year. For many Americans, Bangladesh is a far-off nation on the other side of the world. The challenges workers face there seem distant. But in this country we have risen in solidarity when workers' rights have been ignored. Just as the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in New York City resulted in dramatic changes to U.S. factory safety standards, the tragedies in Bangladesh are a call to action for consumers in America. The principles of fairness and equality for working men and women are deeply interwoven within the fabric of our nation's history. No one will want to wear clothes made in Bangladesh if they are stained with the blood of workers. After these tragedies, I urged the Obama administration to suspend preferential duty-free status for certain products from Bangladesh. Our government responded and since the suspension of Generalized System of Preferences benefits, Bangladesh's government has dropped charges against labor activists and begun to allow local unions to form. In addition to pressure from our government, American and European companies are working together to establish common standards for fire and building safety. A 77% increase in the minimum wage was announced but is not yet enacted. The AFL-CIO's Solidarity Center is training union organizers and the International Labor Organization has established a program to help develop durable institutions to protect workers' rights. But considerable long-term work remains. Unions have a troubled history in Bangladesh. In the past they were subject to undue influence by political forces with agendas that did not put workers first. This legacy will be difficult to overcome -- workers need to feel safe in joining a union and management needs to understand that unions can play a constructive role in worker safety as well as factory production. However, there are disturbing signs of backsliding, so Western governments and consumers must remain vigilant. Some factory managers have intimidated union organizers and thugs have reportedly attacked workers who dared to organize. Dozens of workers have died in fires in Bangladesh's factories since Rana Plaza collapsed. We have a responsibility and an opportunity to bring about change in Bangladesh's garment industry. First, the United States must remain vigilant and ensure that labor law reforms are correctly implemented and labor organizers are protected from anti-union activity. We should also increase funding for efforts, such as the AFL-CIO's Solidarity Center programs, that support workers' capacity to organize and engage in collective bargaining. Second, the government of Bangladesh and the garment industry associations should immediately develop and apply tough sanctions against factory owners who engage in anti-union activity. Finally, international companies must continue to require their supplier factories to abide by strict safety and labor standards. The latter will require long-term, well-resourced programs to educate their suppliers on workers' rights and constructive worker-management relations. They should also implement a zero-tolerance policy for suppliers who consistently engage in anti-union activity. A Bangladesh with a fully empowered work force and safe factories will require sustained action by its government, apparel companies, domestic factory owners, organized labor as well as the international community. It will take time, but this time there can be no going back. A year ago, the world woke up to the horror caused by unsafe working conditions in Bangladesh. We owe it to the victims and the four million garment workers in Bangladesh, who produce a lot of the clothes we wear, to maintain pressure until Bangladesh's workers are given the rights they deserve and the tools they need to protect themselves. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Menendez.","Today marks one year since a fire killed 112 workers in a factory in Bangladesh .

"(CNN) -- A new digital map helps you find the Pokemon among us. YouTube made a shocking confession, Samsung and HTC advanced the world of wearable tech with souped-up gloves and you'll never have to take another lonely selfie, thanks to The Hoff. It must be April Fool's Day on the Internet. In what's become an annual tradition, the tech world embraced the tomfoolery of April 1 with all the gusto you'd expect from clever geeks with time on their hands between hackathons. And the results this year were solid. As usual, Google led the cheeky charge with a spate of gags spanning its many Web and mobile services. First came the rollout of Pokemon Challenge, which turns the iOS and Android versions of Google Maps into a big version of the classic ""catch 'em all"" video and card games. According to the gag -- or are they serious? It's so hard to tell today -- applicants who find all 25 Pokemon hidden around the world will be considered job finalists by Google and given the job title ""Pokemon Master."" ""It's always been important to us to have the most qualified employees at Google,"" Brian McClendon, the company's vice president in charge of Maps, says in a video. ""Now, using the technology created by the Google Maps team, we've prepared the most rigorous test known to man to find the world's best Pokemon Master."" To play, users just need to open the newest version of Maps on their phone, tap the search bar and press start. The Google Maps accounts on Google+, Facebook or Twitter will be providing hints and tips. Google+ announced Auto Awesome Photo Bombs with David Hasselhoff, a tool by which everyone's favorite knight-riding, lifeguarding Teutonic crooner may magically appear in photos they upload to the site. Google Translate will now work with Emojis, the Chrome team announced, letting Web users who cling to those old-fashioned things called ""words"" know what these cheerfully annoying little icons mean. (Spoiler: A pair of clapping hands means ""Yay!"") ""If somebody were able to just explicitly say, 'Hey, I'm flirting with you' or 'Hey, I'm mocking you,' that would just make my life a lot more efficient,"" joked Emily Mee, head of market research for Google Mobile Insights, in a YouTube video. And speaking of Google-owned YouTube, the site made a big April Fool's confession: All those viral videos? Fakes. ""Since 2005, YouTube's staff has worked tirelessly behind the scenes, meticulously crafting the viral videos and Internet memes you've come to know and love,"" the announcement reads. ""From mainstream hits like Gangnam Style and Harlem Shake to your obscure web forum favorites, our staff of writers, producers and directors has shaped the pop culture moments that matter in our digital lives."" The announcement, in a YouTube video, naturally, lifts the lid on the videos that ""we"" will make popular in the coming year. Among them: Clocking, an only slightly more ridiculous cousin to planking, Butter Fails, i.e. YouTube users ""hilariously ruining their bread when they try to spread cold butter on it,"" and Baby Shaming. But Google weren't the only ones putting us on. The gadgety folks at ThinkGeek rolled out a host of gag items, from a car charger powered by the flux capacitor from ""Back to the Future"" to a tie that fires lasers to Mr. Beard, a machine that will help you grow ""Duck Dynasty""-level facial hair in mere moments. Wearable tech is the big thing in the mobile world right now, and two big tech players advanced the game by moving mobile to your hands. Samsung unveiled Samsung Fingers, which includes a flexible LED screen on your palm, a 16-megapixel camera on your finger and 5G connectivity. Meanwhile, HTC countered with the HTC Gluuv, which straps the new HTC One M8 to your forearm and provides the ability to ""like"" things on Facebook by giving an actual thumbs-up with your hand. Airbnb announced that it's expanding into the professional world with AirBRB, which lets you rent desk space from fellow office workers around the world who may have just popped out for a cup of coffee or bathroom break. iFixit, the gadget-repair service, annouced they had been bought by Apple. ""As part of the deal, Apple made a commitment to produce the most replaceable electronic devices and personal computers on the market,"" they said. ""Device is more than a year old? Upcycle. Visit any of our Apple Store locations and an army of well-groomed young people will happily take your money and congratulate your excellent taste."" And CERN, the European scientific-research organization credited with helping to launch the Web, announced that all its communications will be displayed from now on in the (much-mocked) font Comic Sans. So, let us remind you that everything you read on the Internet Tuesday might not be true. In fact, that's advice that should maybe be heeded the other 364 days of the year, too. Those aren't nearly all of the gags floating around the Web on Tuesday. What are your favorites? Let us know in the comments.","In an annual tradition, tech companies launch fake products on April Fool's Day .

"Mumbai, India (CNN) -- Forget going door-to-door, Gaurav Sharma, 31, campaigns from window-to-window. He's an independent candidate running for a seat in India's general election from South Mumbai. Unlike the politicians he's up against, who wear traditional Indian clothes, Gaurav Sharma dresses like a man with extraordinary powers -- the Marvel superhero Spider-Man. As he pops his head into a window after scaling a residential building, he asks startled residents to vote for him. When asked if people take a candidate dressed up as a comic book character seriously, he sincerely says, that they do and they should. Because unlike the fictional superhero, Sharma has real guts, intense concentration and dedication. These are the qualities, he says, that enable him to scale a 45-story building in just 19 minutes. ""It takes a higher level of thinking and great organized thought,"" Sharma says, adding that a candidate needs these qualities to help the citizens of Mumbai. After all, with great power comes great responsibility. Though Mumbai is India's financial capital and one of the wealthier cities in India, ""people are still deprived of the basic necessities like water, electricity, schooling,"" he says. If he's elected, these are the basic issues he will tackle. His election symbol is -- you got it -- a window. These symbols are a crucial part of India's election exercise. In a country where a large part of the population is illiterate, people cast their vote for a symbol rather than a candidate's name. It's a palm for the Congress party, a lotus for the Bharatiya Janata Party, a broom for the Aam Aadmi Party and a window for Sharma. The friendly neighborhood Spider-Man says he hopes the public will grab the window of opportunity they have to bring about change in Mumbai. He hopes they'll take it and vote for him. Will he win? That's still up in the air.","Independent candidate runs for seat in India's general election dressed as a superhero .

"(CNN) -- ""You sure can't eat oil,"" Billy Redwing Tayac, chief of the Piscataway Nation, noted in video from the Cowboys and Indians Alliance protest last week in Washington against the proposed TransCanada Keystone XL pipeline. Ranchers and farmers have joined forces with tribal communities and created the unified coalition in opposing the construction of the pipeline that would transport tar sands oil through their lands from Canada to Texas. Despite TransCanada's promises of jobs and money for the Great Plains region, the CIA is loudly voicing opposition to this shortsighted, quick-cash scheme that would poison the environment as well as humans who live there. It's a simple message really, and one that Native peoples have been repeating for centuries. Whatever we do to the Earth, we do to ourselves. It's not because we are closer to nature than others, have spirit animals or look really attractive on horseback that we know this basic fact. Everyone on Earth knows it, too, but they get pressured to ignore it. There is no escape from the order of nature. We are all subject to the same processes regardless of wealth, position or politics. In the end, there's no way to stave off the simple true-ism that if we poison our land and water, we will sicken and die. Greed and its childish illusions of invincibility have long driven the uniquely foolhardy mindset that dominates American economics. To speak against it was to be marginalized as being a tree-hugger, a hippie or downright un-American. Perhaps until now. At the Protect the Sacred Gathering on the Dakota reservation in South Dakota last year, I witnessed the beginnings of the CIA's current plan of action. I watched and listened as non-Native ranchers, farmers and environmentalists met with tribal folks, perhaps for the first time, creating a common language of love for the land, their families and community. More than a classic sociology 101 class experiment that draws disparate groups together by introducing a common enemy, the CIA's current Reject and Protect action in Washington represents a consciousness shift among non-Natives. In the traditional Native worldview, the land, water and wildlife are also members of the community. We care for these relatives as we would care for other members of our families. As they have learned about this continuity of Native culture and environmental responsibility, the non-Native participants are embracing this philosophy, grateful that someone has finally given them permission to express it. Interviewed by the coordinators of the Reject and Protect website, Ben Gotchall, fourth-generation Nebraska rancher said, ""Historically, cowboys and Indians have been at odds, but no more. The CIA shows our cooperation and working together in mutual respect. ""That shared bond proves that we pipeline fighters are not just a few angry land owners holding out or environmentalists pushing a narrow agenda. We are people from all walks of life and include the people who have been here the longest and know the land best. ""Sadly, they know what it's like to lose their land, to lose the ground that gives a nation its identity. We're proud that they have joined us in this fight. Together this time, we cannot lose.""

"(EW.com) -- If you loved ""21 Jump Street,"" you're in luck: The sequel, ""22 Jump Street,"" is the exact same movie. Since the first film was such a fast and fizzy buddy-cop bromance, that's not the worst news in the world. But it is a bit of a disappointment. Reprising their Mutt-and-Jeff routine, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum play undercover narcs Schmidt and Jenko, who are assigned to go back to school and pose as students to sniff out a drug ring. Sound familiar? Only this time, instead of high school, they're dumped on a college campus, and the drug is a deadly synthetic mix of Ecstasy and Adderall called WHYPHY. ''Do the same thing as last time and everyone will be happy,'' their pencil-pushing supervisor (Nick Offerman) tells the fellas at the outset. And that's precisely what they do, beat for beat, for the next two hours. To cover up the script's lack of originality, screenwriters Michael Bacall, Oren Uziel, and Rodney Rothman pummel us with a string of self-aware meta-commentary jokes that poke fun at bloated sequels. It's as if they're trying to beat viewers to the realization that we're being peddled sloppy seconds. But just because the writers repeatedly elbow the audience in the ribs about how cynical sequels are doesn't make their approach any less cynical. It's a good thing, then, that Hill and Tatum continue to have such great chemistry. Hill's neurotic-motormouth act and Tatum's lovable-lunkhead shtick still shoot giddy sparks. After kicking off with a ridiculously over-the-top action-flick sequence, the guys show up at their swanky new HQ in an old Vietnamese church across the street from their previous digs (hence the new address in the title). Their barking captain, played with hard-a** menace by Ice Cube, informs them that he's enrolling them at MC State, where they'll pretend to be the most genetically mismatched siblings since Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""Twins."" Adding some supporting-cast spice are comedians Kenny and Keith Lucas as a pair of narcoleptically chill identical twins who live across the hall and Jillian Bell as a sarcastic grump who spews acid insults about how old Schmidt and Jenko look. One of the unexpected treats of the first film was the positioning of the Abercrombie-sculpted Tatum as the unpopular loser and the brainy sack of mashed potatoes Hill as the BMOC. Here, the roles are reversed: Tatum bros down with some football-stud frat boys, while Hill is shunned and forced to hang with an emo crowd that includes a beautiful coed (Amber Stevens) he meets when he does a bonkers poetry-slam number that earns him the (untimely) nickname Maya Angelou (see sidebar). The spoken-word bit culminates in one of the film's best moments: a walk-of-shame gag in which Hill exchanges embarrassed glances with female classmates making the morning-after walk across the quad. The movie could've used more cracked scenes like that one. Instead, ""22 Jump Street"" lazily milks the undercover brothers' codependency for gay-panic punchlines (enough already). They bicker. They break up. They go their separate ways. (Cue John Waite's ''Missing You.'') Tatum then finds a new target for his homoerotic double entendres in the alpha-male quarterback Zook, played by Wyatt (son of Kurt) Russell. As the tired investigation spins its wheels to a spring-break climax in Mexico, the movie nearly morphs into a slack installment in the ""Bad Boys"" franchise, complete with shootouts, chases, and even a fiery helicopter explosion. On the plus side, it also gives us more of Bell's delirious deadpan misanthropy. I don't want to give the impression that I didn't laugh at times. I did â€” especially during the film's inspired end-credits tease of future Jump Street installments. But I've come to expect more from directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who have been on a roll with the cult TV series ""Clone High,"" the first ""Jump Street,"" and most recently ""The LEGO Movie."" The merry-prankster duo have a real knack for cheeky pop culture mischief and placing clever new spins on shopworn properties. I get that with sequels, moviegoers are, to some extent, asking to see more of the same. But does the same have to feel quite so samey? Grade: B- . See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Ukraine has suspended one of their top Olympic officials after an investigation alleged he was willing to sell up to 100 tickets for the London Games on the black market. A probe by the BBC, a British broadcaster, made the claims about Volodymyr Gerashchenko, a senior member of the Ukraine National Olympic Committee (UNOC). Gerashchenko, who has been part of the UNOC since 1997, was told of his suspension Wednesday by president Sergey Bubka, the former pole vaulting legend. A statement on UNOC's website quoyed Bubka as saying: ""As President of the Ukraine NOC, I am committed to maintaining the highest standards and ethics within the Olympic Movement. ""I am deeply concerned about these allegations and I have ordered an immediate investigation in Ukraine. I have briefly spoken with General Secretary Gerashchenko and informed him that he is suspended pending this investigation. ""I have also spoken to (London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games) chairman Sebastian Coe since I learnt of this news and informed him that I will ensure that we fully co-operate with any subsequent investigation that takes place in London. ""There has never been a situation where we have had a surplus number of tickets and those that we have received will all be distributed using official channels. ""London 2012 is going to be a spectacular celebration of sport and it is imperative that tickets are distributed to deserving recipients."" However, AFP reported that Bubka's deputy, Viktor Korzh, was dubious about the veracity of the BBC's claims. ""I still have great doubts about this and think that the whole story could come to nothing,"" he is said to have told reporters. In their undercover operation, the BBC alleged Gerashchenko told a reporter he was willing to sell up to 100 tickets. He said: ""I understand you're a dealer -- that's why for me, you are priority number one, the top, the person, in case we have extra tickets to contact you, we contact you."" When the charges were put to him, he is said to have responded that he ""never planned to sell tickets in the UK,"" and had been making ""diplomatic talk to satisfy the persistent interest of the ticket dealer.""","Senior member of Ukraine National Olympic Committee (UNOC) suspended .

"(CNN) -- A teenager has been charged with murder in stabbings at a Houston-area high school that left one student dead and three others injured, the Harris County Sheriff's Office announced Wednesday evening. Luis Alonzo Alfaro, 17, faces one count of murder in the Wednesday morning confrontation at Spring High School, about 20 miles north of downtown Houston, the sheriff's office said. A 17-year-old student was killed and three other students were injured. The three injured students have been released from hospitals, the sheriff's office said. Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia said earlier that ""there has been some information that this may have been gang-related,"" but he stressed that no conclusions had been reached because the investigation was in the early stages. Information on what led to the stabbings was limited. Garcia said an encounter between students turned into a physical confrontation involving ""cutting instruments of some sort."" The statement issued Wednesday evening read in part: ""The stabbing occurred during a physical altercation between several students in the hallways. During the altercation, the suspect produced a knife and fatally stabbed the victim to death and injured 3 other victims."" It was unclear Wednesday night whether Alfaro had an attorney. After the stabbings, students were kept in classrooms for safety and to allow authorities to interview witnesses, said the superintendent of Spring Independent School District, Ralph Draper. The school intended to dismiss students for the day at noon, he said. In April: Stabbing at Texas college . Sheila Dauth, mother of a Spring High School freshman, said she learned of the stabbings around 7:15 a.m., when her son texted her. They continued to communicate in the hours after, while he and other students were kept in their first-hour classes, she said. ""He said he's OK. He said it was pretty scary at first when they were rushing everyone into the classrooms,"" Dauth said. The students have drilled for such situations, ""but I don't think he expected to be in a lockdown"" like this, she said. Dauth said she was disappointed that she learned about the incident through her son and the local media hours before the school district contacted her. The district gave automated phone and e-mail messages to parents about three hours after the stabbings, she said. Draper, while not specifying the time it took to notify parents, told reporters that the district needed to do two things before communicating with families. First was to ensure the rest of the students were safe, and second was to coordinate with authorities so that the investigation wouldn't be compromised.

"(CNN) -- A juror in the George Zimmerman trial says she feels the man who killed Trayvon Martin ""got away with murder."" ""George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God. And at the end of the day, he's going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with,"" Juror B29 told ABC, according to an article posted on the network's website Thursday. ""(But) the law couldn't prove it."" The juror, who used only her first name of Maddy out of concerns for her safety, told ABC that she and others on the panel felt Zimmerman was guilty, but that wasn't enough. ""You can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty,"" she said. ""But we had to grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence."" Thursday night, Martin's mother said she was devastated after hearing the juror's comments. ""It is devastating for my family to hear the comments from juror B29, comments which we already knew in our hearts to be true. That George Zimmerman literally got away with murder,"" Sybrina Fulton said in a written statement. ""This new information challenges our nation once again to do everything we can to make sure that this never happens to another child."" Maddy is the second juror to speak about the high-profile case since the six-person, all-female jury acquitted Zimmerman earlier this month. She and other jurors also have identified themselves by their numbers from the jury pool. Opinion: What if both were white? Last week the woman known as Juror B37 told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" that Zimmerman ""didn't do anything unlawful"" and was ""justified"" in shooting 17-year-old Martin last year. Zimmerman has been out of the public eye since the jury found him not guilty of second degree murder on July 13. His parents told ABC News last week that their family has received an ""enormous amount of death threats."" He fatally shot Martin in the Sanford, Florida, neighborhood where Zimmerman and Martin's father lived in February 2012. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, had a confrontation with the unarmed African-American teen after calling police to report a suspicious person, and he said he shot Martin in self-defense. The case became a flash point in debates over racial profiling, and thousands attended vigils across the country over the weekend, decrying the verdict. Martin's father goes to Capitol Hill . Maddy, 36, is Puerto Rican and a mother of eight children, ABC said. She was the only minority to deliberate in the case. She told ABC that the case was never about race to her. At the beginning of deliberations, she told ABC, she wanted to convict Zimmerman of second-degree murder. But she realized on the second day of deliberations that there wasn't enough proof to convict him of murder or the lesser charge of manslaughter. ""I was the juror that was going to give them the hung jury. I fought to the end,"" she said, according to ABC. Juror B37 told CNN that the jury was initially split -- three and three along the line of guilt. Juror B37 was among those who believed Zimmerman was not guilty from the start. She stressed that she and the other jurors took their responsibility seriously. ""I don't want people to think that we didn't think about this, and we didn't care about Trayvon Martin, because we did. We're very sad that it happened to him,"" she said. Juror B29 told ABC that the decision is still weighing heavily on her, and she thinks she owes Martin's parents an apology. ""It's hard for me to sleep, it's hard for me to eat because I feel I was forcefully included in Trayvon Martin's death,"" she told ABC. ""And as I carry him on my back, I'm hurting as much (as) Trayvon Martin's mother because there's no way that any mother should feel that pain.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- It's likely someone from Hong Kong has just beaten you to this story. The city was found to have the highest average peak connection speed of just over 54 megabits per second during the third quarter of 2012, according to analysis by Akamai Technologies. It's the first time speeds have shot past 50 Mbps and, if the global trend continues, it's just going to get faster. While there was a slight drop in pace over the quarter, over the year average peak speeds surged 36%. In the peak speed stakes, Hong Kong is followed by South Korea (48.8 Mbps), Japan (42.2 Mbps), Latvia (37.5 Mbps) and Romania (37.4 Mbps). The United States straggled in in 14th place with 29.6 Mbps. The U.S. state with the fastest connection is still Delaware with a swift 10.9 Mbps, although the District of Columbia is catching up. For the fastest average connection speeds in Europe, head over to Switzerland (8.7 Mbps), which just beats the Netherlands (8.5 Mbps) to second, while the Czech Republic (7.7 Mbps) is in third. The place NOT to be for speedy downloads is China. Despite a 21% jump in connection speed during the quarter, the country's average peak connection reached just 7.1 Mbps. That makes it the slowest in Asia and gives it a lowly global rank of 123. For consistency, South Korea was the best place to log on, boasting the highest average connection speed of 14.2 Mbps. Japan came second at 10.7 Mbps and Hong Kong third with a surprisingly sluggish 8.9 Mbps. The State of the Internet Report also revealed the top sources of Internet attacks, as well as the most common targets. Once again, China was found to be the single largest source of attack traffic -- 33% -- during the quarter. Attacks from the country doubled during the period, a statistic the report described as ""somewhat surprising."" The United States and Russia came next in the top three. In all, the top 10 countries were responsible for almost three quarters of global attacks.

"(CNN) -- ""Let Allah sort it out."" That is Sarah Palin's succinct argument against U.S. intervention into Syria. And I have to be honest: I'm impressed with Palin on this one. Not with her horribly callous recommendation, made via Facebook late last week, but because she appears to speak some Arabic. I'm not saying Palin is fluent in the language, but she did use the Arabic word ""Allah."" She could've simply used the word ""God"" instead of Allah since it has the identical meaning. (Christian Arabs use the word Allah when speaking of God in Arabic.) I think deep down she wanted to show off her language skills. Could Palin know even more Arabic? She did go on to say that both sides fighting in Syria are, ""shouting 'Allah Akbar' at each other."" She could've easily translated ""Allah Akbar"" into English, noting that the combatants were screaming, ""God is great."" Or as Sen. John McCain remarked Tuesday on Fox News, ""Allah Akbar"" is no different than an American Christian saying, ""Thank God."" Opinion: GOP shouldn't bail out Obama's floundering foreign policy . But Palin went with the Arabic. Why? Because I think deep down she loves the language. And I bet Palin knows even more Arabic words such as humus, falafel and possibly babaganoush. So, let's get back to her statement, ""Let Allah sort them out."" Now, there is a possibility that Palin believes that Muslims worship a different God than Christians and Jews. If she does, is she's actually saying that we should sit back and revel in watching Muslims slaughter each other? Could that be her barbaric message? Possibly. But my cynical side tells me that Palin was just trying to use inflammatory language to get attention. (I know what you're saying: ""No, our Sarah Palin would never do that."") But let's not forget what Palin said about President Barack Obama's comments on Libya: ""Obama's shuck and jive shtick with these Benghazi lies must end."" Palin was roundly criticized for using ""shuck and jive,"" which is a term dating back to 1870s and was originally a ""Southern 'Negro' expression for clowning, lying, pretense."" Palin denied she was being racially insensitive in using that phrase. Was it just an inadvertent slip or a ploy to draw media coverage? So what's the genesis of Palin's statement, ""Let Allah sort it out""? The big debate: Should U.S. strike Syria? Well, it appears to be based on the infamous phrase: ""Kill them all, let God sort them out."" This term reportedly comes from the time of the Crusades. You know, those ""holy wars"" waged by Christians that Sarah might refer to in her Arabic as a ""jihad."" However, this expression was not coined in a battle between Muslims and Christians. Rather, legend has it that it was uttered by a Catholic monk in the 13th century as Crusaders were about to lay siege to the French city of Beziers, a town filled with Cathars, who were considered heretics to the Catholic Church. When the monk in charge of the assault, Arnaud Amalric, was asked by the military commander how to distinguish between heretics and Christians, the monk responded: ""Kill them all, God will know his own."" Consequently, 20,000 people were slaughtered, including women and children. It's unclear if Palin comprehends the origins of the phrase she used, but what's abundantly clear is that she believes that the U.S. should do nothing while people are being slaughtered in Syria. I'm not sure to what God she prays, but I can assure her that the God of Christians, Jews and Muslims demands more than silence in the face of mass killings -- some 100,000 people, including scores of women and children. Many of us would prefer a political solution that ends this conflict. Opinion: Don't use Syria to pump up Pentagon spending . Former President Jimmy Carter has called for a peace summit to try and end the bloodshed while we await a vote by Congress' on military action in Syria. Regardless of how we end the violence, silence is not a morally acceptable option. In the future, if Sarah Palin is going to show off her Arabic vocabulary, it's my hope that she doesn't use it to encourage the world to turn a blind eye as innocent people are butchered. Instead, she might use an Arabic word such as ""salaam,"" which means ""peace,"" and encourages people to support a policy that brings an end to the fighting. After all, peace means the same thing in every language. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: Sarah Palin wrote ""Let Allah sort it out,"" referring to possible U.S. action .
He asks who knew she spoke Arabic? But does she know where that phrase comes from?
He says Catholic monk said it before 13th-century siege that killed 20,000 .

"(CNN) -- In the end, it was Scotty who got beamed up. The ashes of late actor James Doohan, who played chief engineer Montgomery Scott in the original ""Star Trek"" television series and a series of subsequent films, were on the SpaceX rocket that launched a private spacecraft into orbit this week. Doohan's character was referenced in the ""Beam me up, Scotty"" catchphrase associated with ""Star Trek."" In various versions of the command, Capt. James T. Kirk, played by William Shatner, would ask his Scottish-descended colleague to activate a matter teleportation device that would transport Kirk or others to the starship Enterprise. While it is unclear if the exact phrase ""Beam me up, Scotty"" ever was uttered in a ""Star Trek"" episode, it became a popular bumper sticker and Doohan chose it for the title of his autobiography published in 1996. He died in 2005. Celestis, a company that provides memorial spaceflights, confirmed that some of Doohan's cremated remains were among 320 sets on the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched Tuesday. Stellar week for SpaceX founder Elon Musk . In addition, a portion of the cremated remains of Mercury 7 astronaut Gordon Cooper also were on board, the company confirmed. The Falcon 9 rocket, which carried up the SpaceX Dragon craft for a possible rendezvous this week with the International Space Station, is expected to remain in orbit for months until burning up when it falls back into the Earth's atmosphere. ""He would rather have flown when he was alive, of course,"" said Doohan's widow, Wende Doohan, who watched the SpaceX launch Tuesday with the couple's 12-year-old daugher, one of three children from a 31-year marriage. Doohan always told her he wanted his ashes flown in space, she said Thursday, adding that the contract with Celestis was not signed until after Doohan died. ""He was this enormous fan of technology, future technology, space exploration, NASA and anything with mankind reaching out,"" Doohan said. Doohan and Cooper's ashes also were launched in 2007, but that flight failed to make it into space. My friend's ashes ride into space . Charles Chafer, the CEO of Celestis, said Thursday the remains aboard the Falcon 9 rocket came from 18 countries and included many people linked to the space industry, such as workers on the Apollo program. According to Chafer, another celebrity whose remains were included was Randy VanWarmer, who wrote the song ""Just When I Needed You Most."" VanWarmer died of leukemia in 2004, Chafer said. A common theme among those on board was their interest in traveling in space when alive, Chafer said, adding ""but there's also a bunch of folks sort of new age; they wanted to be part of the universe."" In Doohan's case, timing led his acting career to the stars instead of the depths of the ocean, according to his widow. He read for parts on both ""Star Trek"" and ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,"" and got a call back first from ""Star Trek"" producer Gene Roddenberry, she noted. ""No one would know him today if he'd gotten the other call first,"" she said.","James Doohan played Scotty in the original ""Star Trek"" television series .

"(CNN) -- As Amanda Knox left prison, a free woman for the first time in four years, many were left wondering how someone they've been told was responsible for a bloody murder could walk free. For four years, people have been hearing how ""Foxy Knoxy,"" an ""angel-faced killer,"" led her rich Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito and a ""drifter"" named Rudy Guede into a ""sex game gone wrong"" the night after Halloween 2007, finally stabbing British exchange student Meredith Kercher to death with a kitchen knife. Through the course of a trial and an appeal, it became clear that the police had no material evidence for this theory and no plausible witnesses. Our obsession with female evil, our fascination with the possibility of a depraved criminal hiding behind a pretty face, drove the coverage of this case, eliciting innuendo as fact, and excluding at least half of the narrative. Only the most die-hard crime story aficionados even know the name Rudy Guede, who was already in jail for Kercher's murder. Even as Knox returned to Seattle, people around the world, especially in Italy, will never be convinced she is anything other than a sexual psychotic who bewitched two men into killing for her in the name of lust. KING: Amanda Knox returns to Seattle . I began researching my book on the case in 2009 assuming that Knox was guilty. But after only a month in Italy, I realized that almost no evidence supported the charge. Eventually, I corresponded with Knox in prison. The young woman I interacted with seemed troubled by her incarceration, a bit detached and naive, but overall not much different from other women her age. During my investigation, I came to realize that even though three people were convicted of killing Kercher, most people I met who were not reporters could only recall the name of the woman. KIRO: Seattle reacts to Knox's release . None of the journalists in the huge pack in Perugia over the years made any but the most casual efforts to uncover the life story and habits of small-time break-in artist Rudy Guede, whose fingerprints were in the murder room, who never denied being there as Kercher was bleeding to death, and who has been convicted of murdering her in a separate trial. His own story -- an immigrants' son, adopted and then disowned by one of the richest families in Perugia, suffering from fugue states and sleep-walking -- makes him one of the more interesting characters in the case. His past criminal history involving break-ins certainly made him worthy of more study, but no one was inclined to pursue his tale. One reason for the focus on ""Foxy Knoxy"" to the exclusion of the men is the Italian attitude toward women. The story is rooted in a spirituality based in sex and the worship of the female. In Italy, the word ""veneration"" comes from Venus, goddess of fertility, called in Italian, Venere. The primeval object of ""veneration"" was the goddess with the power to call forth desire from men, and to make barren women fertile. In modern Italy, one feminine deity is venerated above the rest: Mary, the mother of Jesus. The young virgin is worshipped apart from God or Christ and the Mary cult is stronger in Italy than in any other European nation. The flip side to Italian veneration of the female deity is her legendary insatiable neediness, the voracious desire and jealousy of females, embodied in the whore, who is also still very much a part of modern Italian culture. Either incarnation carries terrible powers. All women are assumed to be in possession of bewitching seductive powers, but proper women are assumed to know how to use control and limit those powers. Modern young women visiting Italy might not recognize those limits, though, because the stripper or girly show girl was so mainstreamed in Italy, especially during the years of Silvio Berlusconi's control of Italian television and politics. Perugia's Madonna delle Grazie in the Duomo is a larger-than-life, clearly pregnant young woman, painted in 1515 by one of Perugia's Renaissance greats. She wears a brocade blue dress, and her pale eyes are strangely distant and slightly uneven. Perugians hundreds of years ago adorned her image with a real crown. Prosecutor Giuliano Mignini, a staunch traditional Catholic, kept her image hanging on the wall behind his desk and spoke of how she had helped his uncle escape from certain death at the hands of the Russians in the 1940s. The Madonna has a pale, heart-shaped face, tiny pert nose, light distant eyes, and small perfect mouths. Knox bears an uncanny resemblance to both of them. The hippie soccer player from 21st century Seattle could have been the Renaissance artist's model. Many forces abetted the confusion over this very simple if horrible crime, which was almost surely a robbery gone wrong. Superstition, shoddy police work, cultural and actual mistranslation were among those forces. The sexuality of the female at the center of the narrative was one of them. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Nina Burleigh.","Nina Burleigh: The focus was on 'Foxy Knoxy,' even though two men were also convicted .

"Washington (CNN) -- Talk about a tall order. A Congress that can agree on little has 12 scheduled work days to forge a compromise on one of the most volatile issues -- immigration -- before going home for all of August. Failure to find agreement in the next three weeks means no immediate help for a U.S. immigration system overwhelmed by tens of thousands of children from Central America illegally entering the country in recent months. Republicans and Democrats are refining their opening positions this week as officials scramble to keep up with the unprecedented influx amid the hyperpartisan political climate of a congressional election year. Both sides appear supportive of spending more money. The sticking points involve how much to spend on what, as well as the broader policy issue of who gets deported and how fast. What's happened so far . Facing chronic violence at home and motivated by the belief they won't get sent back by the United States, an unprecedented surge of unaccompanied minors from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador continues traveling through Mexico to cross the border into Texas. Administration officials told a congressional hearing last week that almost 60,000 arrived since October 1, with up to 30,000 more expected by the end of the current fiscal year on September 30 -- well over twice the figure of the previous year. They face an immigration limbo of overcrowded holding centers, followed by transfer or release to await deportation hearings that can take months or years to happen and many don't attend. President Barack Obama last week requested $3.7 billion in emergency funding from Congress to respond to what his administration calls an urgent humanitarian situation. The request includes $1.8 billion to provide temporary care for children while they are in government custody, and $1.6 billion to bolster customs and border efforts while cracking down on smugglers. Another $300 million would help Mexico and the Central American governments discourage desperate parents from paying smugglers to get their children into the United States. Also, the Department of Homeland Security announced Monday it had sent about 40 recent arrivals including adults and children back to their home country of Honduras. It said more deportations to the three Central American nations were expected soon. First group of Hondurans deported from new U.S. facility . Republicans contend Obama created the problem by halting deportations of some child immigrants in recent years, a move they say invited more to come. They want any additional resources now to bolster border security and swiftly send back the new arrivals. Democrats argue that additional resources should speed up the processing of the child immigrants, with faster hearings to determine if they have the right to stay and quicker deportations if a judge issues a removal order. Meanwhile, the divisive issue plays out on streets in some affected areas, with protesters in one California town blocking buses transporting new arrivals to temporary facilities. The House . A Republican working group appointed by House Speaker John Boehner to come up with recommendations for legislation reports back Tuesday, with its findings expected to outline the GOP negotiating stance. Boehner already is under pressure from Obama and Democrats to bring up a broad Senate-passed immigration reform measure that would boost border security while providing a path to legal status for millions of longtime undocumented immigrants in the country. Conservatives oppose the Senate plan as an amnesty, knowing it would add millions of likely Democratic voters to election rolls. However, moderate Republicans fear continued GOP resistance to immigration reform supported by a broad coalition of business, faith and social leaders undermines the party's chances to increase its popularity with Hispanic Americans -- the nation's largest minority and an increasingly crucial election demographic. Boehner and other Republican leaders may consider the current border crisis an opportunity to show their willingness to agree on a narrow immigration measure while avoiding the sweep of comprehensive reforms pushed by Obama and Democrats in the Senate proposal. The 2008 trafficking law . Republicans and some Democrats appear focused on changing a 2008 law designed to crack down on child trafficking. The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Action Act requires deportation hearings for child immigrants who show up at the border from all countries except for U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada. It distinguished between neighboring and non-bordering countries because Mexicans or Canadians turned back at the border are in their home country, unlike those from Central American nations and elsewhere. Bipartisan border bill proposed . A proposal by two Texas legislators -- Republican Sen. John Cornyn and Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar -- would remove the hearing requirement, treating child immigrants from all countries the same. To address Democratic concerns, the measure also would allow children who are the victims of human trafficking or have a credible threat of persecution to appear before a judge to seek asylum in the United States, with a decision required within 72 hours of a child's claim. It was unclear if the Cornyn-Cuellar proposal would gain support from House Republicans, while a group of conservative southern House Democrats planned to meet Monday night with Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to discuss the issue. No Senate Democrats have signed onto the Cornyn-Cuellar plan, with several party leaders including Assistant Majority Leader Dick Durbin of Illinois, Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez of New Jersey expressing skepticism at the concept. Durbin set two conditions for his support: legal representation for child immigrants at deportation hearings, and proper social conditions back home if they get deported. The Cornyn-Cuellar proposal relies on existing law that calls on the Department of Health and Human Services to seek out pro bono legal counsel for the child immigrants, but it contains no requirement that they have legal counsel. ""I think that would be a disaster for our immigration system,"" Cornyn said, warning of a prolonged hearing process that would ""serve the goal of some of the people who want to come because it would be years before they were ever deported."" At the White House, spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday that talks with legislators continued on possible revisions to the 2008 law, or leaving it intact while coming up with a separate proposal to give Johnson more flexibility. Earnest made clear that the administration wants arriving immigrants to get a full determination of their legal right to stay in the country. ""We certainly would ensure that they receive the due process to which they are entitled,"" Earnest said. ""But once that due process has run its course, if it's found that those individuals do not have a legal basis for remaining in the country, we would like the secretary of homeland security to be able to exercise the discretion necessary to repatriate that individual or those individuals."" Political fallout . With all 435 House seats and about a third of the Senate up for election in November, both parties seek maximum political advantage from the issue. Republicans criticize Obama's policies for causing the border crisis and complain his administration has been slow to react. Some Democrats joined Republicans in saying the President should have gone to the Texas border to witness the situation for himself when he visited the Lone Star State last week. Obama and Democrats argue the broad reforms they support, which House Republicans have blocked after the Senate passed them, demonstrate their commitment to the plight of immigrants. Earnest noted that Obama proposed his $3.7 billion emergency funding request last week, with no substantive response as yet. ""We've seen a lot of talk from Republicans about how urgent and pressing the situation is, but not a lot of action when it comes to acting on ... a detailed proposal that the President put forward eight days ago,"" he said. In a display of the high stakes involved, the White House planned to meet Wednesday with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to discuss concerns over expedited deportations, and also provide a briefing on Obama's funding request to the Senate.

After the December 2001 fall of the Taliban, Bin Laden and his cohorts fled his Kandahar compound. (UWIRE) -- English majors getting tired of Shakespeare and Wordsworth will soon be able to turn to Yale's libraries for a poet of different kind altogether: Osama bin Laden. Yale is in the midst of processing, preserving and archiving 1,500 audio tapes recorded in bin Laden's Afghanistan headquarters from 1988 through 2000 -- a collection that includes recordings of everything from celebrations after militant actions to religious sermons to, yes, bin Laden's poetry. The university has already digitized 335 of the tapes and will have the rest of the project completed in a few years, Yale spokesman Tom Conroy said. Once the archiving is finished, the entire collection will be available to researchers and students. ""The library's duty is to ensure the long-term preservation and access to these and other materials for decades and centuries to come, and for future generations of scholars,"" Conroy said. The tapes took a roundabout route to New Haven, Connecticut. In December 2001 Bin Laden and his cohorts fled his Kandahar compound, leaving behind hundreds of audiotapes of gatherings, speeches and sermons that would be unearthed by CNN in the ensuing weeks. The network turned over the tapes to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which decided to release the tapes after concluding that the recordings did not contain any sensitive intelligence. David Edwards, director of the Williams College Afghan Media Center, obtained the tapes with the intention of preserving and cataloging them. Edwards, a professor of anthropology and sociology, alerted his colleague Flagg Miller, an assistant professor of religious studies at the University of California at Davis, of the tapes' availability for research purposes. But Edwards subsequently determined that the tapes, having been tossed around and kept in a damp and dusty environment, were in fragile condition and required treatment. He said he thought they would be accessible to a wider range of people at a large research university -- particularly one with a strong interest in Middle East collections, such as Yale. In 2005, he offered the audiotapes to the Yale Library Manuscripts and Archives, and later that year they made the trek from Williamstown, Massachusetts. to New Haven, Connecticut. William Massa, head of collection development for Yale libraries, said that while the original audiotapes are being kept in a Yale library shelving facility in nearby Hamden, Connecticut, researchers, including those without a Yale ID, are welcome to use Yale's digital archive to access the tapes that have already been restored and processed. ""Anybody who registers to use Yale's resources can have access to the digital recordings,"" he said. Conroy said researchers can listen to the digital files in the original Arabic on a secure laptop in the Manuscripts and Archives reading room. For now, Miller is the sole researcher studying the tapes. Miller, who has access to the original tapes but also uses copies, said the tapes are helping him to investigate the role that language ideology and poetry play in contemporary Muslim reform in the Middle East. Miller, who over the past three years has been translating and transcribing the tapes, said his research will be compiled into a book that will seek to explain the development of Bin Laden's militant movement with respect to the role of language in Islam and Muslim culture. ""The collection represents the most important database on Bin Laden's intellectual formation that is available to the public,"" Miller wrote in an e-mail. Miller said Western scholarship and the media have focused specifically on Bin Laden's public statements surrounding September 11 and on rare occasions have revisited earlier statements that he made about the West. The cassettes in the collection, in contrast, offer recordings from as far back as the late 1980s in which Bin Laden can be heard opining on issues such as fighting the Soviet Union, which invaded Afghanistan in 1978. The cassettes include ""moving personal narratives of martyrdom"" from members of a group that in time would develop a more rational public persona, Miller said. The New York Times has reported that one of the tapes includes a recording of notorious Egyptian-born cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri preaching to jihad recruits by comparing frying eggs to holy war. Despite the tapes' high-profile content and recent coverage in major news outlets such as the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, many Yale history and political science professors interviewed for this article, including those who specialize in the Middle East, said they were unaware of the recordings' residence in Yale's libraries. ""This is the first time I have heard of them,"" political science professor Andrew March said. More than 200 speakers are featured in the audiotape collection, with 20 audiotapes featuring Bin Laden's voice.","Yale University archiving 1,500 audio tapes recorded by Osama bin Laden .

"(CNN) -- At the last minute, Morgan Victoria's friend convinced her to attend their 10-year high school reunion. Victoria hadn't had any intention of going to ""such a silly thing,"" but her friend's significant other couldn't make it and, well, peer pressure doesn't end at 18. Victoria balked as the former class president handed her a name tag. On it was Victoria's senior photo. Walking around the event, something inside of her snapped. ""I'm wearing a picture of me 10 years younger and 100 pounds lighter,"" Victoria remembers. ""It was humiliating."" ""The next day I was like, 'That's it.' "" At the August 2012 reunion, Victoria weighed 255 pounds and wore a size 18 dress. Over the next nine months, she lost more than 100 pounds by moving more and eating less. ""There is no secret,"" Victoria says about weight loss. ""All you have to do is care. If you honestly care about yourself, if you honestly care about getting it done -- that's all you have to do."" Victoria didn't grow up overweight, though she sometimes felt like it in her athletic family. Her parents cooked healthy meals around the house, and Victoria swam, played tennis and ran cross country until she left for college. At the Savannah College of Art and Design in Georgia, where she majored in communication arts (otherwise known as comic books and poetry, she jokes), she ate whatever she wanted. That included plenty of junk food. ""You eat the cheap stuff,"" Victoria remembers. ""It wasn't like I was getting home from the studio and being like, 'I need some lean protein and vegetables.' "" When she graduated and struggled to find work, she ate even worse. Though she lived in Savannah, Georgia, a walking city, she never went to the gym and couldn't combat the excess calories she was consuming. At 5' 8"", her body mass index was 38. (Over 30 is considered obese.) In 2011, Victoria married Lyndsay Rosenlund in a small private ceremony with family and friends in Washington state. The couple moved to Atlanta and started going out for dinner frequently with friends. But the day after her high school reunion, Victoria went into the pantry of their home and got rid of anything with more than a few ingredients on the label. She read about serving sizes and started using an app to count calories. She even bought a food scale. ""Honestly, all of it was kind of hard,"" Victoria says. ""At 255 pounds, you don't actually want to do anything. ... Exercising was hard because I was embarrassed. Nobody wants to be the fat girl working out."" So she stayed out of the gym, and started walking with Rosenlund and their dogs, Giuseppe and Romona. She walked for about an hour every morning and an hour every night. Eventually she gained enough confidence to jog. Now she runs 5Ks. ""We tried running together when we first started our journey, but it turns out I hate running,"" Rosenlund says. ""However, we both enjoy hiking so we try and hike every chance we get."" The couple also tried to limit how often they ate out. When they did go to a restaurant, they made a game plan and made smarter choices. Water instead of beer. Balsamic vinaigrette instead of ranch dressing. Victoria swears she never goes hungry. She relies on big salads, air-popped corn and lean protein to keep her full without a lot of calories. With these simple strategies, she lost about 2 pounds a week. Rosenlund also lost 50 pounds. Victoria now wears a size 6 and has maintained her final weight of 150 pounds for nearly a year. ""Morgan has a lot more energy and less anxiety,"" Rosenlund says. ""I think that the weight loss has definitely improved her outlook on life."" ""I feel amazing,"" Victoria agrees. ""You feel totally different about yourself. You shouldn't feel all that from weight, but you do.""","Morgan Victoria had an ""aha"" moment at her 10-year high school reunion .

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday, protests rocked the American embassy compound in Cairo, while heavily armed militias overran the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, killing U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and several others. The incidents initially seemed related, but they are in fact dramatically different developments. In Egypt, a 2,000-strong crowd of protesters gathered in front of the U.S. Embassy to protest a film that depicts Islam in crude and offensive ways. The film is apparently being promoted by an Egyptian-American Coptic Christian now living in the United States and Terry Jones, the Florida pastor of ""International Burn a Koran Day"" infamy. News: Six things to know about the attack . At the American embassy in Cairo, some protesters scaled the walls and in the courtyard were able to take down an American flag and put up a black Islamic flag associated with militant Islam. Why the Egyptian police, ever-present outside the American Embassy, allowed the protesters to progress that far is an unanswered question, although they -- like the U.S. Marines guarding the embassy - might have reckoned that stronger action to stop the protest could have quickly escalated into violence. The incident was eventually defused peacefully, and the Muslim Brotherhood has called for Egyptians to protest peacefully against the offensive film on Friday. The Egyptian government is struggling to walk a fine line on this situation. On the one hand, the Egyptian public is deeply offended by the video and looks to its government to defend the faith. While President Morsy has made some lukewarm statements about the responsibility of the Egyptian government to protect diplomatic missions, he has issued much stronger words denouncing the film. Indeed, he has demanded the United States take ""all possible legal action"" against the producers of the movie, an indication he does not fully understand our First Amendment. This is a widespread problem across the Arab world: People who have lived their lives largely under dictatorship simply cannot understand how a film can be made without government sanction. Their protest against the film is a protest against America. Opinion: Extremists don't speak for Libya . On the other hand, Egypt's government is also well aware that ongoing street protests and any type of violence badly hurt its efforts to revive an economy that depends largely on tourism. The protests also could undermine international support. Egypt needs U.S. support for a $4.8 billion International Monetary Fund loan, and the United States is also considering forgiving $1 billion in Egyptian debt. As a statement from Egypt's foreign ministry about the embassy protests correctly noted, ""Such incidents will negatively impact the image of stability in Egypt, which will have consequences on the life of its citizens."" Reports of what happened in Libya are still emerging, but it seems clear that the takeover of the consulate was a well-planned attack by a highly armed group. The protests against the video simply provided an expedient cover or perhaps were even coincidental with an attack planned for the anniversary of 9/11. The success of the assault underscores the fragility of the security situation in Libya. Not only are there competing militias that have yet to relinquish their weapons, there are also various heavily armed jihadi groups determined to replace the state with an Islamic government. The attack in Benghazi was apparently planned and carried out by members of a ""pro al Qaeda group,"" perhaps in retaliation for the death of a Libyan al Qaeda member in June. Although local forces tried to fire back, they were no match for the group's guns, grenades, and by some accounts, rockets. Libya's president condemned the violence, saying, ""We refuse that our nation's lands be used for cowardice and revengeful acts. It is not a victory for God's Sharia or his prophet for such disgusting acts to take place."" However, it is unclear whether the government can respond effectively to the myriad security challenges it faces. To bolster Libyan capabilities, Washington is apparently sending reconnaissance drones over Libya to help hunt down the jihadi perpetrators. The tragic violence in Libya and the unrest in Egypt raise the stakes on long-simmering tensions and issues. While debates over free speech and the role of religion in society have defined the Egyptian political scene in recent months, religious frictions between Egyptian Coptic Christians and Muslims are now at an important inflection point. The association of an Egyptian Copt with the offensive video is sure to inflame those tensions. In Libya, the violence is yet another indication of competing visions for the future of the country, which, despite a successful national election in July, have not been resolved. Opinion: Libya killings show U.S. at risk in Arab world . If history is anything to go by, we can expect difficult weeks ahead as protests against the video spread and likely erupt into violence in other places. In a notorious case beginning in 2005, cartoons negatively depicting the prophet Mohammed, published in a Danish newspaper, sparked uproar from Indonesia to Afghanistan to Morocco. At least 200 people lost their lives in unrest related to that controversy. How much momentum the current video controversy generates will depend in no small on part on whether Islamic leaders in Egypt and other countries call for restraint or choose to fan the flames. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Isobel Coleman.","Isobel Coleman: Origins of anti-American actions in Egypt, Libya were quite different .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A Columbia University professor, who gained notoriety when a noose was found on the door of her office, has been fired after months of public and private allegations of plagiarism and racial targeting. Madonna Constantine, professor of psychology and education at the university's Teachers College, was initially suspended after an independent 18-month investigation into allegations of plagiarism concluded that on several occasions she had published academic work without crediting others for content. Constantine immediately denounced the findings as well as her suspension, calling the university's actions ""vindictive and mean-spirited."" ""It is my opinion that this investigation, along with other incidents that have happened to me at Teachers College in recent months, point to a conspiracy and witch-hunt by certain current and former members of the Teachers College community,"" she said in a written statement. Twenty-six pages of tables and spreadsheets submitted to CNN by Paul Giacomo, Constantine's attorney, contend that the passages in question can be traced to previous writings by Constantine. According to Giacomo, the former teacher at the school and two former students who alleged plagiarism had in fact plagiarized from Constantine. He called the termination of his client's employment an ""entirely retaliatory"" move intended to punish Constantine for filing a grievance against the university president and appealing the faculty's prior decision to suspend her. He called the university's treatment of his client unfair. ""To me, it was tantamount to a kangaroo court,"" Giacomo said of the review process. ""They wanted to be rid of her."" A spokesperson representing Teachers College disagreed. ""She was given a full and fair opportunity to respond to the allegations against her,"" Marcia Horowitz of Rubenstein public relations told CNN. ""She was provided with copies of the journal works where similarities were found and was given an opportunity to explain them. All appropriate legal processes were followed."" Giacomo said Constantine may challenge the university's actions in court. The NYPD would not comment on the progress of the investigation into the noose incident.

"(CNN) -- A letter from Albert Einstein warning of the persecution of Jews in Germany on the eve of World War II sold for nearly $14,000, about double the auctioneer's highest prediction. The hand-signed letter went Tuesday night for $13,936, including the buyer's premium, said Sam Heller of the California auction house which sold it. The auctioneer did not reveal who the buyer was. The physicist writes of the importance of ""rescuing our persecuted fellow-Jews from their calamitous peril and leading them toward a better future"" in the June 10, 1939, letter. Einstein praises New York businessman Hyman Zinn for his ""splendid work"" on behalf of refugees. ""We have no other means of self-defense than our solidarity and our knowledge that the cause for which we are suffering is a momentous and sacred cause,"" Einstein writes to Zinn, of the Manhattan Button Company. The typewritten letter, hand-signed ""A. Einstein,"" was written just under three months before the outbreak of World War II, when the persecution of Jews was already well underway. Auctioneer Nate Sanders had expected the letter to go for $5,000 to $7,000. It ""contains powerful content showing that Einstein was devoted to the Jewish people,"" Sanders said in a statement. An estimated six million Jews died at the hands of the Nazis and their allies in the Holocaust. Einstein was born in Germany but renounced his citizenship in 1933, when Adolf Hitler became leader of Germany, and moved to the United States.","Einstein warns that ""our fellow-Jews"" face ""calamitous peril""

"(CNN) -- Florida authorities Wednesday announced the arrests of 22 people, including three who listed Walt Disney World as their employer, in a sting of people allegedly targeting children for sexual activity. The arrests came after a weeklong investigation involving the Lake County sheriff's cybercrimes unit in central Florida and other agencies. In the sting, which was called ""Be Mine,"" detectives posed as children, or parents of children, in various online chat forums to connect with suspects seeking children for sex, authorities said. A vacant home was set up as a meeting place for the encounters, authorities said. As the detectives were solicited for sex, arrangements were made for the suspects to travel to the home for what they believed would be sex with a child. Upon arrival, the suspects were arrested. One suspect, identified as David Griffith, 47, allegedly told detectives that he had recently made arrangements to meet a 7-year-old child in another county for sex. After reviewing his e-mails, detectives found conversations between Griffith and the 7-year-old's mother. When the child was interviewed, she told investigators that her mother had sexually abused her, police said. The other suspects were identified as Marcos Soto-Rossi, 30; Joey Hughes, 31; Brian Baker, 25; Tyler Edge, 23; Ryan Roach, 25; Alexander Vorobets, 27; Paul Samaroo, 31; Robert Kingsolver, 49; Troy Allen Dupler, 43; David Penny, 32, who police said is a registered sex offender; Patrick Holgerson, 32; Joel Torres, 32; Aaron Will, 23; Nasib Jobe, 39; Angel Eduardo Alvarez, 29; Ariel Ovanounou, 20; Belal Shofique, 33; Mathew Dove, 20; David Earl Parker, 43; Adam Michael Jimenez, 25; Nathan Taylor Sullivan, 22. Kingsolver, Holgerson and Torres listed their employers as Walt Disney World, authorities said. The nature of their jobs was not known. Marilyn Waters, a Disney spokeswoman, said the three have been placed on unpaid leave pending the outcome of the cases. The charges against the suspects included soliciting a child for sexual acts, traveling to meet a minor, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution and failing to disclose HIV status to a sexual partner.","Sting dubbed ""Be Mine"" nets 22 people allegedly targeting children for sex .

"(CNN) -- As Hillary Clinton makes a whirlwind round of appearances in her last days as secretary of state, one groundbreaking aspect of her work deserves a moment in the spotlight: In a bold departure with tradition, Clinton made the promotion of equality for gay people a core value of U.S. foreign policy. That is a transformative change, one that advances the cause of human rights around the world -- not just for gays and lesbians, but for everyone. The way governments treat their LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) citizens can tell us much about their overall approach to human rights and democracy. Mistreatment of sexual minorities is a microcosm of greater repression. Take a look at the gruesome spectacle of young gay men executed by the government of Iran in the streets, for all to see. Or, look at the new anti-gay laws coming into effect in Russia's increasingly authoritarian regime. It is no accident that the growing repression of LGBT Russians coincides with a dramatic deterioration of political freedom and what the nonpartisan Freedom House called ""the return of the iron fist in Russia."" It is clear that gays and lesbians are the canaries in the coal mine of human rights. When gays live under pressure, everyone should worry. That, however, is not how Clinton explained it 14 months ago, when she stood before the Human Rights Council in Geneva, in front of an audience filled with representatives from Arab and African countries, from places where homosexuality is a crime, even one punishable by death, and declared that gay rights and human rights ""are one and the same."" Gay people, she explained, deserve equality simply because everyone does. It was Human Rights Day, the commemoration of the signing of the 1948 U.N. Declaration of Human Rights, and she used the occasion to send a message to the world on behalf of the United States. She declared unequivocally that there is no exception for gay people when it comes to human rights. Opinion: President Hillary Clinton? If she wants it . She admitted that the U.S. record on human rights for gays and lesbians ""is far from perfect."" But by proclaiming, without caveat or qualification, the American stance on the issue, she sent a signal to the rest of the world that, while equality for gay people is far from reached, the rightness of the goal is beyond debate, much like it is with equal rights for women or for racial minorities. In doing this, she announced it was now the official policy of the U.S. government to promote the rights of LGBT people everywhere. Clinton has always been a couple of steps ahead of President Barack Obama when it comes to gay rights. It's a safe bet she persuaded him to jump on board and put the full force of the administration behind this new policy. In Geneva that day, she announced that the president had instructed all U.S. government agencies working in other countries to ""combat the criminalization of LGBT status and conduct"" to help protect vulnerable LGBT, helping refugees and asylum seekers and responding to abuses. Today, American diplomats, as part of their official mandate and as an explicit tenet of U.S. values, must speak up for the rights of individuals experiencing persecution on the basis of their sexual orientation, as when a couple were sentenced in Cameroon for ""looking"" gay. News: Hillary Clinton talks future 'adventures' America may be not as influential as it once was, but no country carries more weight; there's not even a close second. America's opinion matters if you want foreign aid or political assistance. But it matters even more to people on the ground, eager, perhaps desperate to make their case before the authorities, their boss or their family. In the latter case, that it was the popular and respected Hillary Clinton making the argument undoubtedly made a difference on a personal level, even if dictators did not relent. Clinton also noted that ""being gay is not a Western invention; it is a human reality,"" and noted nations that have enacted protections for their gay citizens, including South Africa, Colombia and Argentina. It was a rebuke to that tragicomic moment in 2007, when Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told an audience in New York, ""In Iran, we do not have homosexuals like you do in your country,"" prompting an explosion of laughter from the crowd. Of course, gay people live in Iran, where homosexuality is punishable by death. America's stance, promoted so passionately by Clinton, is gradually becoming the global standard for human rights. Under intense lobbying from America, the usually feckless and frequently counterproductive U.N. Human Rights Council adopted a measured entitled ""Ending Violence Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity,"" and another supporting equality, important symbols that this is a standard for the entire world. Clinton moved the issue of equality for members of the LGBT community to the front of America's diplomatic agenda; in the process, she gave a boost to human rights for all and a considerable nudge to the inexorable progress of freedom. Let's hope her successor doesn't let up. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: As secretary of state, Clinton made equality for gays a foreign policy value .

"(CNN) -- If the pre-vote predictions had been accurate, football heavyweights Italy would be preparing to host the 2012 European Championship. It wasn't a shock on the scale of Qatar's swoop for the 2022 World Cup, but the joint bid from Poland and Ukraine was at one stage considered third favorite to host Euro 2012 -- out of three candidates. But taking advantage of the hooliganism and match-fixing allegations making ugly headlines in Italy back in 2007, Poland and Ukraine stole up on the outside to pip both the 1968 champions and another joint bid from Hungary and Croatia to the honor. Racism, rather than Ronaldo and Ribery, dominates Euro 2012 storylines . Fulfilling UEFA chief Michel Platini's ambition of balancing the power in European football, this will be the first major football tournament in the former Iron Curtain. But as early as 2008, Platini was telling Ukraine to ""get going"" as the building of new stadiums and improvements in the transport network slipped behind schedule. At one stage, there was even talk of Scotland stepping in as emergency host. By the end of 2011, Platini was diplomatically describing the buildup as a ""complicated adventure."" ""Difficult births often lead to beautiful babies,"" the French football great concluded in March as Poland and Ukraine finally declared they would be ready for the June 8 kickoff when an estimated worldwide audience of at least 150 million is expected to be watching. Only time will tell whether Platini will return to UEFA's headquarters in Switzerland a proud father. Most major sporting tournaments experience a rocky buildup, Poland and Ukraine's has been at the turbulent end of the scale -- understandably so, given the countries' lack of major event experience coupled with ambitious improvement plans that are reported to have cost $38 billion combined. The stadia are breathtaking. Five of the eight on show during the tournament are brand new, and the existing venues in Kiev, Donetsk and Kharkiv have undergone major developments. The 50,000-capacity, newly-constructed National Stadium in Warsaw will host the opening game between Poland and Greece. Kiev's 60,000-capacity Olympic Stadium, which began life in 1923 as the Red Stadium of Lev Trotsky and hosted games during the 1980 Moscow Olympics, has been completely renovated with a new transparent roof and will host the final on July 1. While the venues have been tested, the transport network will come under scrutiny for the first time when an estimated one million fans descend on the two countries. Ukraine faces a race against time to complete the planned 1,750 kilometers of new roads in time for the start of the tournament. It has also shipped in high-speed trains from South Korea to ease travel between the two host countries. Poland has already accepted that some of its transport improvements -- including the construction of 750 km of new motorways -- may not be ready. ""We know not everything will be completed in time for Euro 2012,"" Poland 2012 communications director Mikolaj Piotrowski told CNN late last year. ""But today we can say that a lot of important investment projects will be completed three to five years sooner than without the Euros scenario, so I think it was worth it to see Michel Platini opening the envelope in Cardiff in 2007."" If getting around should be manageable for fans, finding somewhere affordable to stay once they get to their destination is an altogether trickier task. England -- traditionally one of the best-supported European teams -- failed to sell out its original allocation of tickets for its group games in Kiev and Donetsk, with many fans opting to stay at home as Ukrainian hotel owners seek to make hay from the tournament by ramping up prices. In April the Football Supporters' Federation said fans were being quoted as much as $1,000 a night for a three-star room. The England team avoided that problem by choosing a base in Krakow, Poland -- even though it will mean thousands of miles of travel between the two countries. If it isn't financial concerns putting off fans, it is the fear of the kind of reception they'll get. The English Foreign Office warns that there has been a recent ""increase in hostility"" toward gay people in Ukraine and that ""travelers of Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent and individuals belonging to religious minorities should take extra care."" The families of black England players Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain have already decided against traveling to Ukraine -- and that was before a BBC documentary highlighting racism and violence in the host countries was screened . ""It's a major concern,"" said Oxlade-Chamberlain's father Mark, himself a former England player. ""I think your safety is more important than a game of football."" Poland, too, has suffered serious problems with racism. ""Monkey chanting, banana throwing, that has happened in Polish matches unfortunately,"" Rafal Pankowski from the campaign group Never Again told CNN. ""We want to use the Championships to highlight some of the issues and make a difference in a positive way in terms of anti-racism education."" A series of bomb blasts in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine's fourth largest city, in late April only added to the pervading nervousness over traveling to the country, while several EU leaders will boycott the tournament over Ukraine's treatment of imprisoned opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko. Amnesty International, meanwhile, has warned of ""widespread police criminality"" in Ukraine, leading to concerns that any crowd trouble could be met with a particularly brutal response. UEFA has always accepted that giving Euro 2012 to Poland and Ukraine was a risk. ""From the beginning, it was a big challenge to go to Poland and Ukraine,"" Platini told CNN last month. ""Four years ago when all the signs were red, red, red -- stadium, roads, accommodation -- it was not easy. ""But I say it was a good risk."" And Kiev could witness a historic moment if Spain can follow up 2008's victory and become the first team to successfully defend the title since the tournament began 52 years ago. On a lighter note, we await the predictions of Ukraine's ""Psychic Pig"" and Poland's ""Citta"" the elephant with interest. They follow in the footsteps of 2010 World Cup soothsayer Paul the Octopus in what seems to be becoming a curious tradition at major football tournaments. For most pundits, the Spanish are favorites for the title, but they have their problems. Record scorer David Villa and veteran defender Carles Puyol have been ruled out of the tournament, while striker Fernando Torres -- who netted the only goal of the 2008 final -- has endured another torrid season for Chelsea. Their competition looks set to come from Joachim Low's youthful Germany side, 2010 World Cup finalists Netherlands, and perhaps a France team that appears to be back on an even keel under the calming influence of Laurent Blanc. Italy, six years on from the scandal that so seriously damaged the country's chances of hosting the tournament, is embroiled in another match-fixing crisis that led defender Domenico Criscito to be cut from the squad. The English are even less fancied, particularly so among their own pessimistic supporters. Roy Hodgson took up his coaching job just 29 days before the first game against France and has to get the best out of a squad that must survive the first two games without the suspended Wayne Rooney, one of the team's few world-class players. As for the hosts, Poland looks to have the easier group with Czech Republic, Greece and Russia. Ukraine must contend with France, England and Sweden. For 35-year-old national icon Andriy Shevchenko, the tournament is a chance to put the perfect full stop on a 17-year international career. ""Ukrainians, our time has come!"" declares the team's slogan. UEFA might be hoping it also applies to the country as a whole.","Euro 2012 kicks off on June 8, with 16 nations taking part .
Buildup to the four-yearly tournament has been difficult for the co-hosts .

"(CNN) -- Polls finally closed in Egypt's presidential election Wednesday, and workers have started to count the ballots, according to Egyptian state media. An extra day of voting was added to boost turnout, but it may have done little, according to CNN crews who witnessed no lines at polling places throughout Cairo. The election, initially scheduled for Monday and Tuesday, pit former army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi against Hamdeen Sabahy. The election commission extended the voting saying people living far from where they are registered need to return to vote, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported. No numbers have been released, but the move came after TV hosts had openly criticized voters for not participating. Both Candidates had criticized the extra day of voting and had filed complaints. ""We strongly denounce the (election commission's) decision to extend voting another day. Extending the voting period for no real plausible reason will open the door to possible vote violations and rigging,"" said Hussein Abdel Ghany, a top adviser to Sabahy. Sabahy's campaign announced Wednesday that it's withdrawing its delegates who observe the polls because they have been arrested or assaulted: . ""In the past 48 hours we were subjected to a wide range of abuses, assaults and violations. These include preventing campaign delegates from entering the polling stations, and assaulting and arresting them,"" it said in a statement. Egyptian Prime Minister Ibrahim Mehleb had even declared Tuesday a public holiday ""in compliance to citizens' wishes,"" state TV reported. The decision was thought to be a move to increase turnout. Human Rights Watch said Egypt's 10-month-long crackdown on the opposition undermined the fairness of the presidential elections. ""The mass arrests of thousands of political dissidents, whether Islamist or secular, has all but shut down the political arena and stripped these elections of real meaning,"" the group's Middle East director, Sarah Leah Whitson, said in a statement Wednesday. The election was called because President Mohamed Morsy was removed from power in July in a popular military coup. Al-Sisi, who was army chief at the time, stepped down from his military post this year to run for president.","NEW: Polls closed in presidential election amid low turnout .

"(CNN) -- How many people can play the same video game? Not in the same video game, mind you, but play the exact same game at once? With the help of a social-media robot, more than 80,000 people are currently trying. A version of ""Pokemon Red/Blue,"" a 1990s game for Nintendo's Game Boy, has been streaming on Twitch.tv, an online video platform devoted to gaming, for the past five days. A user known only by the gamer tag ""TwitchPlaysPokemon"" set up the ""social experiment"" to accept chat commands as the equivalent of button pushes. You know, typing ""up"" moves your character up, ""down"" moves him down and whatnot. Except that tens of thousands of other people are doing the same thing at the same time. The resulting movements of the main character have been spastic, to say the least. Although the horde managed some success in the first few days, capturing several of those elusive Pokemon, the sheer number of people now tapping commands into Twitch's chat window is causing the game's main character, Red, to wander back and forth over the same spot, bang into walls and check his inventory with neurotic frequency. The page has been viewed more than 10.6 million times, with the number of active users peaking at about 81,000. ""This is one more example of how video games have become a platform for entertainment and creativity that extends way beyond the original intent of the game creator,"" said Matthew DiPietro, vice president of marketing for Twitch. ""By merging a video game, live video and a participatory experience, the broadcaster has created an entertainment hybrid custom made for the Twitch community."" The modified game's creator, whose real identity is unknown at this point, has implemented some features to cut down on trolling and help with coordination. The ""start"" command has been disabled, after people started spamming it into the chat, and the game now has ""Anarchy"" and ""Democracy"" modes that players can select via a virtual voice vote. ""Anarchy"" is essentially the experiment's original form, in which everyone's command is applied immediately. In ""Democracy,"" players are allowed to vote on their character's next move. It takes a vote from 75% of the players to switch modes, though. And you can imagine how easy that is. Fans of the game have created their own subreddit, Twitch Plays Pokemon fan art, progress tracking via a Google document and a Twitter feed. Twitch.tv hopes this inspires others to transform gaming into entertainment. ""I didn't really have any plans for it from the beginning,"" the creator said in an e-mail to gaming site Polygon. ""I just wanted to put it up to see how people would respond. I put it together and put it up on a dedicated server all within a few days."" He, or she, has been keeping track of players' progress, or lack thereof, and says it would be considered a win if they masses defeat the game's Elite Four -- opponents who need to be bested before a final confrontation.

"(CNN) -- A civilian boarded a U.S. Navy destroyer at the world's largest naval base, took a gun from a Navy guard and used it to fatally shoot a sailor before security personnel shot and killed him Monday night, Naval Station Norfolk's commanding officer told reporters Tuesday. The shooting happened at about 11:20 p.m. aboard the USS Mahan, which was docked at the Virginia base's Pier 1, Capt. Robert Clark said. The civilian -- a man -- had credentials to be at the base and the pier, having ""worked at the installation at a previous time,"" Clark said. He added he believed the credentials did ""not necessarily"" allow him to be on the ship, and that investigators were trying to determine whether he had a current assignment at the base. The names of the people involved in the shooting were not immediately released. The Navy was trying to inform the sailor's family about his death, Clark said. The man was approaching the quarterdeck when sailors working security confronted him, Clark said. During a struggle, the man disarmed the petty officer of the watch, he said. He used the petty officer's gun to shoot and kill a different sailor who had come to help, Clark said. ""Naval Security Forces then killed the suspect,"" Clark said. Clark emphasized that the man was not armed when he entered the base. Clark said he didn't know why the man was there Monday night, and he didn't provide details about the nature of his previous work at the base. The civilian had credentials to be on the base but breached security to get on the ship, a U.S. defense official told CNN earlier Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. Naval Station Norfolk was briefly locked down after the shooting. Clark said officials would examine the base's security procedures because of the shooting.

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- A Chinese ship loaded with arms and ammunition sailed away from a South African waters and is on its way to Luanda, Angola to unload its cargo bound for Zimbabwe. South Africa's High Court ruled Friday the cargo could be offloaded in the Durban port, but it could not pass over South Africa roads to get to Zimbabwe, a country in crisis because of an election stalemate. Durban's dockworkers also said they would not handle the cargo, fearing the arms would be used by the Zimbabwean government against its own people. A South African government source told CNN the China-flagged An Yue Jiang had sailed away from Durban Friday evening before the High Court's order could be served to the ship's captain. The ship was headed to the port of Luanda, Angola, according to the South African Department of Transport. Zimbabwe is in turmoil after elections last month that saw the opposition Movement for Change party win a majority of seats in the parliament, although Mugabe's ZANU-PF party has contested 16 seats, claiming the MDC cheated. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission began a recount of 23 of those districts Saturday morning. The presidential election, however, has sparked much more concern. The government of President Robert Mugabe, who has been in power since Zimbabwe won its independence in 1980, has refused to release results of that vote before a recount. The MDC says its candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai, won the election, but ZANU-PF has claimed the MDC engaged in election tampering. The delay in releasing the vote sparked violence and a government crackdown on opposition members. ""This union has a proud history of taking action against regimes which it disapproves of in the past, but this is certainly the first time it has gotten involved in an African regime like Zimbabwe,"" David Cockroft, general secretary of the International Transport Workers Federation, said. ""I don't think there's much doubt that the (dock) workers ... are very strongly against the Mugabe regime,"" he said. Cockroft said that arms had almost certainly been shipped to Zimbabwe through Durban in the past, but the size of this shipment -- ""more than a million pounds"" and 3.5 million rounds of rifles, small arms, mortar shells and rocket-propelled grenades -- made it more noteworthy. Earlier, South African Revenue Service spokesman Adrian Lackay told CNN ""that it is commonplace for landlocked neighboring states in southern Africa to use South African ports of entry for the transshipment of goods."" Lackay indicated that the ship had complied with South African regulations requiring it to disclose the contents of the cargo it is carrying. A government spokesman, Thembo Maseko, told CNN, ""There were arms on the ship."" The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement in a fax to the Reuters news agency saying that China and Zimbabwe have normal trade relations, that the Chinese government takes a ""prudent and responsible"" position on arms deals and that it does not involve itself in the internal affairs of other countries.

"(CNN) -- Three teenage boys in a Connecticut town -- at least two of them popular high school football players -- stand accused of rape for alleged encounters with two 13-year-old girls. And at least one of the alleged victims has been attacked on social media, with messages from fellow teens calling her a ""whore."" The allegations are spiraling through Torrington, a small town of 36,000 people in northwest Connecticut. The case has come to light just days after two teenage football players in Steubenville, Ohio, were found guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl in an incident involving disturbing, boastful text messages and a series of social media attacks against the accuser. Now Torrington is thrust into the national spotlight, becoming a new focal point for worries over teenage sex, rape and the use of social media to alternately attack both the alleged victim and the accused . The Torrington cases are very different from Steubenville, however. ""What we're dealing with here is an age difference,"" Lt. Michael Emmanuel, commander of the Torrington Police Department Detective Division, told CNN. ""If it was a one-year age difference... there would have been no crime."" How do I raise a boy not to be a rapist? Connecticut law makes it illegal for a teenager to have sex with a minor more than three years younger than him or her. ""These victims knew the arrestees, they were friends with them,"" and they were involved in the encounters ""voluntarily, although it was still wrong,"" Emmanuel said. It was ""consensual"" in the sense that there was not an attack but was illegal because by law, a 13-year-old is too young to give consent, he said. Joan Toribio and Edgar Gonzalez, both 18, are charged with sexual assault, risk of injury to a minor and illegal contact with a child, prosecutor Terri Sonnemann told CNN. The alleged offenses occurred in early February. Toribio also faces similar charges in an alleged earlier incident in January involving one of the two alleged victims. Police documents provided to CNN list the alleged offenses by Toribio and Gonzalez as ""sex forcible rape."" The young men have not made a public statement. An attorney for Toribio declined to comment. Gonzalez's attorney, J. Patten Brown III, said his client denies all charges against him. Gonzalez is being held in jail pending trial because his mother cannot afford to post bond, Brown said. ""We pleaded not guilty, and we asked for a jury trial,"" Brown said. ""We deny anything occurred; we deny all allegations."" Torrington High School senior Joe Tessora told CNN affiliate WFSB that Toribio and Gonzalez are ""the coolest guys ever. They're not all that bad. All this stuff is getting pulled out of proportion."" Opinion: In Steubenville, why didn't other girls help? A 17-year-old boy has also been charged in an alleged incident last fall, police said. Because he is a minor, authorities have not released information about him. Authorities have not released many details because the cases remain under seal. Emmanuel explained how the case began: The family of one of the alleged victims learned of the encounter and reported it to police. That sparked an investigation, which led to police discovering that two 18-year-olds had allegedly sexually assaulted two 13-year-old girls, and that one of those girls had also allegedly been sexually assaulted by a 17-year-old boy last fall. Attacked on Twitter . After word broke of the case in February, some people, many of them fellow teens, began vicious attacks, particularly against the girl whose parents had gone to the police. ""I wanna know why there's no punishment for young hoes,"" one person tweeted. ""Young girls acting like whores there's no punishment for that young men acting like boys is a sentence,"" another tweeted. ""I hope you got what you wanted,"" wrote another. One tweet accused her of having ""snitched."" The local newspaper, The Register Citizen, archived images of tweets before many were taken down. ""Even if it was all his fault, what was a 13 year old girl doing hanging around with 18 year old guys,"" tweeted one girl, whose Twitter handle seemed to no longer be active Thursday. She later tweeted that she was misunderstood. Healing process after rape never ends . One boy tweeted that he is the cousin of the girl who wrote that tweet, and that some people on Twitter were ""threatening to kill"" her for what she wrote. Brown, Gonzalez's attorney, said his client had no knowledge of the Twitter traffic, has had no access to computers and has had no visitors who could have informed him. ""I find it interesting that the accused's name is published but not the accuser's,"" Brown said. ""But that's the law, and I have every intention of respecting and obeying the law, and my client has every intention of respecting and obeying the law as well. ""He's more concerned with moving forward with the trial, being exonerated and putting this behind him,"" Brown said.

"Brunswick, Georgia (CNN) -- A Glynn County, Georgia, grand jury indicted two teenage defendants in the death of a 13-month-old boy, the district attorney announced Wednesday. Because the defendants were younger than 18 when the killing took place on Thursday, they cannot face the death penalty if convicted. De'Marquise Elkins, 17, and Dominique Lang, 15, were charged with murder last week and made their first court appearance Monday. CNN is identifying Lang because he is charged as an adult and media in the community have been naming him since he was arrested. Elkins faces malice and felony murder charges. Lang is accused of felony murder. Among other charges, each teen is accused of aggravated assault, criminal attempt to commit armed robbery and first-degree cruelty to children. Elkins also is accused of attempted robbery on March 11. According to the indictment, the gun used in each case was a .22-caliber revolver. Last week, Sherry West told reporters she was pushing her baby, Antonio Santiago, in a stroller in broad daylight in Brunswick, Georgia, when two teenagers approached her. One demanded money and pointed at her what West first thought was a fake gun. But he fired at her twice, missing her head and hitting her in the leg, West said. The teen then shot the baby Antonio in the face, West said. Neither teen entered a plea during Monday's court hearing. The indictment also includes charges against Elkins' mother, Karimah, his sister, Sabrina Elkins; and an aunt, Katrina Elkins. Karimah and Katrina Elkins are accused of making a false statement. Karimah and Sabrina Elkins are charged with tampering with evidence by throwing a firearm into a pond. The mother also is accused of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Congress approved a $3.4 trillion budget for the coming year Wednesday, approving most of President Obama's key spending priorities including increasing in health care, education and alternative energy spending. Congress approved a budget plan Wednesday, President Obama's 100th day in office. The spending plan passed without a single Republican vote in either the House or Senate. The Senate voted for the plan 53-43. Four Democrats, including recent party-switcher Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, voted against it. Earlier, the House approved the budget 233-193, with 17 Democrats voting against it. The measure passed two days after congressional Democrats reached an agreement reconciling House and Senate versions of the budget package. ""Today, for the first time in many, many years, we have a president's budget ... that is a statement of our national values,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said during the final debate on the House floor. ""What is important to us as a nation is reflected in this budget. It's a very happy day for our country."" Republicans said the budget reflected reckless taxing and spending priorities that would leave the country in a more fiscally precarious position. ""Budgets are supposed to be about tough decisions, and there are no tough decisions in this budget,"" said House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio. ""It spends an awful lot of money, it raises a lot of taxes, and it puts all of this debt on the backs of our kids and grandkids. This is not the American way. The American way has been about a more limited government."" In one of the most contentious and politically polarizing decisions this year, Democratic budget negotiators decided to fast-track a key part of the budget process. Major health care reform is likely to pass this year because the special process, known as budget reconciliation, won't allow Republicans to filibuster the legislation, as was widely expected. Democrats, who control 59 seats in the Senate, will be able to pass it with a simple majority vote instead of the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad, D-North Dakota, said he didn't believe that the Senate would need to use reconciliation but noted that it is ""there as an insurance policy."" Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyoming, speaking for most of his GOP Senate colleagues, warned in the budget debate that if a health care ""reconciliation winds up in the budget bill, it'll be like a declaration of war."" Under the Democratic plan, the federal government will run an anticipated deficit of $1.2 trillion in the next fiscal year. Their plan promises to cut the deficit by more than half by 2012. ""It is clear that more will be needed to address the long-term fiscal imbalance confronting the nation beyond the five-year budget window,"" Conrad said. Under the compromise plan, increases in non-defense discretionary spending are limited to 2.9 percent through 2014. Obama's signature tax cuts from the stimulus plan -- $400 for individuals and $800 for couples -- are slated to expire after 2010. The measure also allows former President George W. Bush's tax cuts for couples who make more than $250,000 to expire in 2010. The budget compromise largely tracks the Obama administration's initial $3.67 billion proposed spending plan, with the notable exception to drop his $250 billion request for potential bailouts of struggling financial institutions. Fiscally conservative House Democrats, known as Blue Dogs, also negotiated with Democratic leaders to cut $10 billion from the president's $540 billion request for non-defense discretionary spending. In an additional nod to her caucus's conservatives, Pelosi and House Majority Whip Steny Hoyer sent a letter to Senate leaders ""throwing down the gauntlet"" to insist that a pay-as-you-go system be followed, which would require new federal spending to be offset with budget cuts or tax increases, a Democratic aide said. Obama called for the ""PAYGO"" legislation in his weekend radio address. The president also gathered his Cabinet members last week and challenged them to cut a total of $100 million in the next 90 days. In the context of the federal budget, $100 million in savings is a tiny amount, critics say. It is the equivalent, according to one example, of having a car dealer offer to shave $1 from the cost of a $36,700 vehicle. ""Any amount of savings is obviously welcome,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said at the time. ""But [$100 million is] about the average amount we'll spend every single day just covering the interest on the stimulus package that we passed earlier this year."" White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said ordinary Americans would nevertheless appreciate the savings effort. ""Only in Washington, D.C., is $100 million not a lot of money. It is where I'm from. It is where I grew up. And I think it is for hundreds of millions of Americans.""","Senate votes in favor of budget 53-43; House votes 233-193 .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has denied allegations that she failed to heed warnings of possible corruption in a rice subsidy program whose recent problems have stoked anger among farmers in the country's rural heartland. The controversy over the rice program has deepened the political crisis in which Thailand has been mired for months. Thailand's National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) said Tuesday that it was bringing charges against Yingluck over the program, which pledged to pay farmers well above the market rate for their rice but has run into financial problems. The commission has summoned Yingluck, whose government is already under pressure from months-long protests in Bangkok, to appear February 27 to be notified of the charges. ""I wish to assure you that as I have served my duty with righteousness and contrary to the charges brought against me by the NACC, I have done nothing wrong,"" Yingluck said in a statement Thursday. The anti-corruption commission's charges, which accuse Yingluck of ignoring warnings of corruption in the program, could eventually lead to the suspension of the Prime Minister from all political positions. ""Though I may be charged in this criminal case and may have to give up my position in accordance to the wishes of those who want to topple my government, I will still lend my full cooperation and give necessary information to the NACC,"" she said. Yingluck insists that the rice subsidy program, introduced in 2011, has been successful and benefited farmers. But critics says it has wasted large amounts of public funds trying to please rural voters, hurting exports and leaving the government with large stockpiles of rice it can't sell without losing money. The program has encountered intensified difficulties after an election earlier this month was disrupted by anti-government demonstrators and failed to deliver a conclusive result. The situation has left Yingluck's weakened caretaker government struggling to operate effectively and ensure payments are made to rice farmers. Angry farmers . Problems with the subsidy program have angered many farmers, normally an important component of Yingluck's support base. Groups of farmers have held protests in recent weeks after not being paid for their rice. About 3,000 farmers from central Thailand spent Thursday night camped out on the outskirts Bangkok after traveling on tractors, trailers and quad bikes. They had threatened to take their protest to the city's main airport, Suvarnabhumi, if they didn't get paid what they're owed. But the leader of the group of farmers, Chada Thaiseth, said Friday that they would be heading home later in the day after the government informed them they would be paid early next week. The farmers said their planned protest wasn't political -- unlike the anti-government demonstrators in central Bangkok, they say they don't want to see the ouster of Yingluck. But they do want their money. Long-running protests . The tensions over the rice program come against the backdrop of the protests by groups affiliated with Yingluck's political opponents. Those demonstrations, calling for Yingluck to step down, have been taking place in central Bangkok since November and have been plagued by outbreaks of deadly violence. Earlier this week, police tried to clear demonstrators out some protest sites. But the efforts resulted in violent clashes that left five people dead, including one police officer, and dozens wounded. Police have since suspended their attempts to seize the protest sites for the time being. And a court ruled Wednesday that the government can't use force and weapons against peaceful unarmed protesters. The protest leaders say they want to rid the country of Yingluck and her wealthy brother, the deposed former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Thaksin, who lives in exile, faces a corruption conviction, which he says was politically motivated, if he returns to Thailand. Political opponents say Yingluck, who convincingly won elections in 2011, is simply Thaksin's puppet, an allegation she has repeatedly denied. The protests were sparked in November by Yingluck's government's botched attempt to pass an amnesty bill that would have paved the way for her brother's return to the political fray in earnest. The protesters say they want Yingluck's government replaced by an unelected ""people's council,"" which would oversee electoral and political changes. CNN's Kocha Olarn and Saima Mohsin reported from Bangkok, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","NEW: Rice farmers call off a planned protest at Bangkok's main airport .

"(CNN)  -- South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, already under fire for an extramarital relationship, should be impeached for abusing state finances, a Republican state senator said Monday. A Republican senator in South Carolina says Gov. Mark Sanford should be impeached over financial violations. Sen. David Thomas -- the chairman of the Senate constitutional and administrative subcommittee -- wrote to leaders of the Republican-controlled Senate, accusing the governor of violating state regulations. The allegations involve flights he took to London, England, and China in 2006 and 2007 on state business. South Carolina requires the governor to charge the state the lowest rate available unless there are overriding circumstances, such as emergency travel. ""The two flights by Gov. Sanford were in violation of the South Carolina Code of Regulations,"" Thomas said in his letter. ""The difference in price between the most economical and the more expensive price of the seats the governor chose is approximately $13,700."" Thomas said he thought the violations were enough to trigger impeachment proceedings. ""If I were in the House, the answer would be yes, I would be involved in the beginning of the impeachment process,"" he said. ""I think there is enough data right now to take seriously a move toward impeachment. Is that sufficient for impeachment? That I don't know."" Sanford has been under fire since he disappeared in late June. Initially, there was speculation that he had simply gone off to recover from a bruising legislative session, in which he lost a fight to reject $700 million in federal stimulus money. His office tried to quiet the rumors, saying Sanford was hiking along the Appalachian Trail. But the governor offered a different account when spotted in the Atlanta, Georgia, airport after nearly a week out of pocket. With his wife nowhere in sight, a teary-eyed Sanford confessed to the affair with a woman from Argentina in a rambling news conference. He stepped down as head of the Republican governors' group. Thomas urged Sanford to resign after he admitted his affair. Sanford said then that he intended to continue as governor and would try to rebuild his relationship with his wife and family. Last Friday, South Carolina first lady Jenny Sanford said she and her four boys were moving out of the governor's mansion in Columbia and back to their home in Charleston for the upcoming school year. Jenny Sanford announced the news in a statement e-mailed to reporters, days after the family returned from a two-week vacation to an undisclosed location in Europe. In response to his wife's decision, Sanford said, ""The first lady's office has already put out a statement that speaks for the family, on this decision that we felt best, both for our process of reconciliation, and for the boys in the upcoming school year.""","State Sen.

"(CNN) -- Venezuela's president said Monday that he is expelling three U.S. diplomats for their alleged involvement in acts of sabotage to destabilize the South American country. ""They have 48 hours to leave the country,"" President Nicolas Maduro said in remarks broadcast on state-run VTV. ""Get out of Venezuela,"" he said, listing several names. ""Yankee go home. Enough abuses already."" The list includes Kelly Keiderling, who is the top U.S. diplomat in Venezuela as the charge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, according to the embassy's website. ""We have seen Maduro's televised announcement but we have not received any official notification of expulsions,"" said a U.S. State Department spokesperson. ""We completely reject the Venezuelan government's allegations of U.S. government involvement in any type of conspiracy to destabilize the Venezuela government."" Maduro accused the group of diplomats of meeting with right-wing political opponents of his government, financing their activities and encouraging them to sabotage the country's electrical system and its economy. Earlier this month an electrical blackout left more than half of Venezuela without power. At the time, Maduro blamed the opposition for the massive power outage. The country has also been battling inflation and goods shortages. Hours before he announced former President Hugo Chavez's death from cancer in March, Maduro said he was expelling two U.S. Embassy officials and accused them of plotting to destabilize the country. At the time, State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell denied the accusations. ""This fallacious assertion of inappropriate U.S. action leads us to conclude that, unfortunately, the current Venezuelan government is not interested an improved relationship,"" he said. Several days later, the United States expelled two Venezuelan diplomats in response. Maduro's remarks Monday are the latest in a series of accusations alleging plots to destabilize his government or assassinate him. He has made at least 11 such accusations since the beginning of his presidency, CNN en EspaÃ±ol reported last week. Maduro canceled his plans to travel to New York and attend the U.N. General Assembly last week because of what he said were plots to physically harm him there. Venezuela: Recording of 'kidnapped' Chavez is fake, president says .

"New York (CNN) -- Calling a sharp drop in overall violence throughout America's most populous city ""one for the record books,"" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced this week that 2009 saw historic crime-rate declines across the city's five boroughs. The declines occurred in nearly every crime category, including the ""lowest number of murders ever,"" Bloomberg said Monday. According to the mayor's office, there have been 461 homicides to date on Monday in 2009. That number is down nearly 11 percent from the same time a year ago, with 516 murders recorded in 2008. Bloomberg said 2009 is on track to have the fewest murders in New York City's history since reliable recordkeeping began in 1963. Bloomberg, with New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly at his side, relayed the latest findings at the New York Police Department graduation ceremony for the city's 250 newest officers. The mayor said the drop in New York's crime rate can be attributed to a combination of using new technologies and strong management, using statistics in police planning and responses, adequately funding the department and focusing resources to address problem areas. Along with stringent gun laws, regulations and enforcement mechanisms, the combination of all these strategies ""have helped to substantially reduce the level of violence on our streets,"" Bloomberg said. Bloomberg and Kelly called special attention to ""Operation Impact,"" the city's program aimed to address particularly dangerous locales. Started in January 2003, the operation floods troubled areas, known as ""Impact Zones,"" with teams of rookie and veteran police officers. The program has allowed the police department to mass resources to provide security for those living in high-risk locations, Kelly said. ""Police officers are saving lives in New York City every day, usually in the poorest neighborhoods,"" Kelly said. New York City had not had a year with fewer than 600 recorded murders before 2002, but there have been eight consecutive years with fewer than 600 slayings, according to crime records. This year also saw the 19th straight year of overall decline of major felony crimes, authorities said. The highest spike in New York City murders came in 1990, when 2,262 people were killed, according to the NYPD. Since 2001, all major crime rates in New York have declined by 35 percent, according to the police department. Rape and robbery are down 38 percent and 34 percent, respectively. Murders and assaults have dipped by 29 percent, according to the department. National violent crime trends also are on the decline, according to the FBI. The bureau released nationwide crime statistics in June for the first half of 2009, showing a nearly 4.5 percent drop in overall violence. Murder is down by 10 percent from a year ago across the United States, according to the FBI. The new class of officers from Monday's graduation joins the largest police force in the world, one with about 38,000 uniformed personnel. ""The world will be watching them start their careers,"" Kelly said at Monday's graduation. ""Their first assignment is on patrol at Times Square on New Year's Eve.""","As of Monday, New York City had 461 murders; that's down almost 11% from 2008 .

"(CNN) -- The United States has created a ""zone of impunity"" by rarely investigating private contractors involved in the unlawful killing of civilians in Afghanistan and Iraq, a U.N. human rights envoy said. Civil rights activists protest the use of unmanned U.S. drones in Pakistan. The U.S. government should track the number of civilians killed in its military operations abroad and limit collateral damage from unmanned drone attacks, Special Investigator Philip Alston said in a stinging report submitted Wednesday to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland. ""The government has failed to effectively investigate and punish lower-ranking soldiers for such deaths, and has not held senior officers responsible,"" Alston said. ""Worse, it has effectively created a zone of impunity for private contractors and civilian intelligence agents by only rarely investigating and prosecuting them."" Alston recommended that the United States establish a national commission to independently look into the policies and practices that are leading to the deaths. He also urged that an independent special prosecutor be charged with pursuing criminal allegations against government officials accused of wrongdoing. ""First, the government has failed to track and make public the number of civilian casualties, or the conditions under which deaths occurred,"" he said. ""Second, the military justice system fails to provide ordinary people, including U.S. citizens and families of Iraqi and Afghan victims, basic information on the status of investigations into civilian casualties or prosecutions resulting therefrom."" Alston called the United States' reliance on pilotless missile-carrying aircraft ""increasingly common"" and ""deeply troubling."" U.S. forces operating in Afghanistan have used drones to attack militant targets in Pakistan. Pakistan has said the attacks have claimed hundreds of civilian lives. Mark Cassayre, the American representative to the U.N. Human Rights Council, said U.S. military and intelligence operations during armed conflict did not fall within the special investigator's mandate. Alston is the special investigator on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. ""We wish to be clear that the prosecution of private contractors who commit crimes is an important priority of the Department of Justice, and despite the difficulty of these cases, the United States continues to attempt to bring private contractor cases to justice,"" Cassayre said.","U.N. envoy rips U.S. over investigation into drone attacks overseas .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The women are too afraid and ashamed to show their faces or have their real names used. They have been driven to sell their bodies to put food on the table for their children -- for as little as $8 a day. Suha, 37, is a mother of three. She says her husband thinks she is cleaning houses when she leaves home. ""People shouldn't criticize women, or talk badly about them,"" says 37-year-old Suha as she adjusts the light colored scarf she wears these days to avoid extremists who insist women cover themselves. ""They all say we have lost our way, but they never ask why we had to take this path."" A mother of three, she wears light makeup, a gold pendant of Iraq around her neck, and an unexpected air of elegance about her. ""I don't have money to take my kid to the doctor. I have to do anything that I can to preserve my child, because I am a mother,"" she says, explaining why she prostitutes herself. Anger and frustration rise in her voice as she speaks. ""No matter what else I may be, no matter how off the path I may be, I am a mother!""  Watch a woman describe turning to prostitution to ""save my child"" » . Her clasped hands clench and unclench nervously. Suha's husband thinks that she is cleaning houses when she goes away. So does Karima's family. ""At the start I was cleaning homes, but I wasn't making much. No matter how hard I worked it just wasn't enough,"" she says. Karima, clad in all black, adds, ""My husband died of lung cancer nine months ago and left me with nothing."" She has five children, ages 8 to 17. Her eldest son could work, but she's too afraid for his life to let him go into the streets, preferring to sacrifice herself than risk her child. She was solicited the first time when she was cleaning an office. ""They took advantage of me,"" she says softly. ""At first I rejected it, but then I realized I have to do it."" Both Suha and Karima have clients that call them a couple times a week. Other women resort to trips to the market to find potential clients. Or they flag down vehicles. Prostitution is a choice more and more Iraqi women are making just to survive. ""It's increasing,"" Suha says. ""I found this 'thing' through my friend, and I have another friend in the same predicament as mine. Because of the circumstance, she is forced to do such things."" Violence, increased cost of living, and lack of any sort of government aid leave women like these with few other options, according to humanitarian workers. ""At this point there is a population of women who have to sell their bodies in order to keep their children alive,"" says Yanar Mohammed, head and founder of the Organization for Women's Freedom in Iraq. ""It's a taboo that no one is speaking about."" She adds, ""There is a huge population of women who were the victims of war who had to sell their bodies, their souls and they lost it all. It crushes us to see them, but we have to work on it and that's why we started our team of women activists."" Her team pounds the streets of Baghdad looking for these victims often too humiliated to come forward. ""Most of the women that we find at hospitals [who] have tried to commit suicide"" have been involved in prostitution, said Basma Rahim, a member of Mohammed's team. The team's aim is to compile information on specific cases and present it to Iraq's political parties -- to have them, as Mohammed puts it, ""come tell us what [they] are ... going to do about this."" Rahim tells the heartbreaking story of one woman they found who lives in a room with three of her children: ""She has sex while her three children are in the room, but she makes them stand in separate corners."" According to Rahim and Mohammed, most of the women they encounter say they are driven to prostitution by a desperate desire for survival in the dangerously violent and unforgiving circumstances in Iraq. ""They took this path but they are not pleased,"" Rahim says. Karima says when she sees her children with food on the table, she is able to convince herself that it's worth it. ""Everything is for the children. They are the beauty in life and, without them, we cannot live."" But she says, ""I would never allow my daughter to do this. I would rather marry her off at 13 than have her go through this."" Karima's last happy memory is of her late husband, when they were a family and able to shoulder the hardships of life in today's Iraq together. Suha says as a young girl she dreamed of being a doctor, with her mom boasting about her potential in that career. Life couldn't have taken her further from that dream. ""It's not like we were born into this, nor was it ever in my blood,"" she says. What she does for her family to survive now eats away at her.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The case of a convicted rapist paroled in 1999 has come back to haunt Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, with the mother of a woman the convict later murdered pledging to campaign against the former Arkansas governor. Mike Huckabee says he did not try to influence the Arkansas Parole board to parole Wayne DuMond. Huckabee, during his first term as Arkansas governor, expressed support for the parole of Wayne DuMond in a letter to him. DuMond was serving a life sentence for raping a 17-year-old girl. The Arkansas parole board had the final say on DuMond's parole. Less than a year after his release from prison in 1999, DuMond was accused of raping and murdering Carol Shields, a woman in Kansas City, Missouri. DuMond was convicted of the crime in 2003. He died in prison in 2005. Huckabee on Sunday confirmed to CNN he had sent the letter to DuMond. The murdered woman's mother, Lois Davidson, said she will ""absolutely campaign against"" Huckabee, and said she decided to come forward when he started doing well in the polls. ""It's because he is a serious contender,"" Davidson said. ""I didn't think he had a chance, but now he's right up there in Iowa."" In an interview with CNN Wednesday, Huckabee said it was ""heartbreaking"" that the murders had become politicized. ""There are families who are truly, understandably and reasonably, grief stricken,"" Huckabee said. ""And for people to now politicize these deaths and to try to make a political case out of it rather than to simply understand that a system failed and that we ought to extend our grief and heartfelt sorrow to these families, I just regret politics is reduced to that."" Huckabee said he had considered granting DuMond clemency, but he dropped the idea in response to public outcry. Huckabee also said he did not grant clemency because he wanted to ensure DuMond was supervised when he was released from prison. ""Had I granted his commutation, then there would have been no supervision at all,"" Huckabee said, ""I wasn't comfortable with that."" The DuMond case began in 1985, when he was accused of raping a 17-year-old girl. Before trial, DuMond was attacked in his home and castrated, and the local sheriff kept the severed testicles in a jar. No charges were brought in the attack. Huckabee said the process leading to DuMond's release began under former President Bill Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas. Clinton and, later, Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker commuted part of DuMond's sentence, Huckabee said, because they thought it was excessive. When he spoke about the case, Huckabee suggested his role in the decision to parole DuMond was limited. Huckabee said it was the decision by Clinton and Tucker that made DuMond eligible for parole, and Huckabee declined to reduce DuMond's sentence further. In 1996, Huckabee sent a letter to DuMond saying parole was the best option for him, the National Review reported. ""I've never made a decision about the DuMond case other than the decision to write the letter"" to DuMond, Huckabee said. ""That was my decision, but I didn't parole him, because governors don't parole people in Arkansas."" However, Charles Chastain, a parole board member at the time, told ABC News he felt pressure from Huckabee when the board considered DuMond's parole in 1996. The Arkansas Times reported in 2002 that two other board members said they were influenced by Huckabee to parole DuMond. Huckabee denied he asked the board to approve DuMond's parole. ""No, I did not,"" Huckabee said Sunday. ""Let me categorically say I did not."" Huckabee said Wednesday his discussion with the parole board in 1996 was a general discussion about clemency, not about the DuMond case. Huckabee noted that the three board members who said they were pressured were appointed to the board by Democrats Clinton and Tucker. Documents posted on the Web site The Huffington Post indicate Huckabee received letters from several victims of DuMond before his release. The letters detailed his past actions and pleaded that he remain incarcerated. ""I feel that if he is released it is only a matter of time before he commits another crime and fear that he will not leave a witness to testify against him the next time,"" one victim wrote. She described how DuMond had raped her at knifepoint. A former top Huckabee aide confirmed to CNN the then-governor received that letter and a follow-up phone call from the victim. In another letter, a woman documented how her mother was raped by DuMond, and said he had told her mother he would rape her daughter if she did not cooperate. The Huffington Post said it received the never-before-published letters from a ""deeply troubled"" former aide to Huckabee who believes the presidential candidate has ""deliberately attempted to cover up his knowledge of DuMond's other sexual assaults."" Huckabee spokeswoman Alice Stewart denied to the Huffington Post that Huckabee received any of the letters, but later told CNN he got at least one from a victim named ""Onita,"" who lived in DeWitt, Arkansas. It's not clear if this is one of the letters posted on the Huffington Post, because the site has redacted the names. The Huffington Post has published three victims' letters, and says it will post additional files later Wednesday. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Always outspoken. Always challenging the system. Always a champion for freedom. Anderson Cooper's conversation with singer, actress and activist Madonna about her ""Art for Freedom"" movement yielded not only a sense of the passion she has for it, but also revealed a few things about the woman who has both scandalized and intrigued the world with her refusal to be anyone other than herself. Here are five things we learned from Madonna: . 1) This project is the most important thing she's done besides raising her kids . By providing people a vehicle in which to express their thoughts on freedom by sharing their photographs, videos, music or other media, Madonna feels an incredible sense of responsibility. And just as she does not take her role as a mother to her four children lightly, she also feels an incredible sense of responsibility for ""Art for Freedom."" ""This is a situation where I have put in I don't know how many man hours,"" she said. ""I've poured my own money into it. Steven Klein [the photographer who is working jointly with her on it] has done the same. We've done it for no financial gain, (and) also not to promote any product in particular. The only reason we're doing this is because we want to shed light on subjects that need to have light shed on (them)."" 2) She worries about humanity . One of Madonna's main concerns, she said, is ""that the world we are living in is collapsing to a certain extent, and that civilization as we know it is caving in on itself."" ""I think 95% of that reason is that we are at a very low level of consciousness, and we do not know how to treat each other as human beings,"" she said. 3) You are proving her point right now . The singer has such a strong belief in the transformational power of creativity and art that she wants others to be able to have that voice. So those wishing to participate need only to click on the ""Art for Freedom"" website because, as Madonna points out, the Internet is how the world now communicates. ""That's how we reach one another,"" she said. ""We watch things on Youtube, we listen to music on iTunes, and we connect to feelings, we connect to situations. We are inspired to change, we gain strength, we are horrified...This is how people are reached through art, through creativity."" 4) Madonna doubts that some of the great artists would be able to make it in these times . It goes without saying that the music icon is squarely against censorship and political correctness. After all, this is a woman who was slammed by the Vatican in 1989 for her ""Like a Prayer"" music video with its imagery of the stigmata and burning crosses as well as her nude coffee table art book titled ""Sex."" But today's artist must contend with issues such as being perceived as ""brands"" and being judged for their personal lives - all of which she feels would probably have hampered the creativity of some of the legends like John Lennon and others. ""[The late R&B singer] Marvin Gaye was an incredible artist,"" Madonna said. ""But his personal life was pretty in question if you really put him under a microscope. I'm not sure how far he would get in this day and age."" 5) She has very personal reasons for rallying for freedom and the disenfranchised . Madonna has been a vocal advocate for gay rights, used her celebrity to bring attention to the issue of poverty in the African nation of Malawi through the charity Raising Malawi and paid tribute to Malala Yousufzai, a Pakistani girl shot and critically wounded by the Taliban because of her advocacy for girls' education. She said she feels so strongly about fighting against oppression and conformity because she's been there. ""I'm not saying this to feel sorry for myself, but I wasn't very popular,"" Madonna said. ""It's just in my nature that I wanted to challenge the system."" Watch Anderson Cooper . 360° weeknights 8pm ET.

"(CNN) -- Another cruise ship, another fire. And for thousands of passengers, another vacation cut short. More bad news for a cruise company? Maybe not. Less than an hour after a Memorial Day fire aboard Royal Caribbean's Grandeur of the Seas was extinguished, company officials started tweeting out details. The fire forced the cancellation of the rest of a seven-day cruise to Port Canaveral, Florida; CocoCay and Nassau, in the Bahamas. The ship changed course and sailed under its own power to Freeport in the Bahamas, arriving about 10 a.m. the same day. Days after the Cruise Line Industry Association announced its Passenger Bill of Rights, Royal Caribbean had the opportunity to put it to the test. Cruise line passengers get bill of rights . Tweeting cruise fire news . The ship had been docked just six hours when Royal Caribbean tweeted that passengers would receive full refunds of the fare paid and a certificate valued at the May 24 fare for a future sailing. The bill of rights requires only partial refunds for voyages that are terminated early because of mechanical failures. Another promise of the 10-point bill of rights is transportation to the scheduled port of disembarkation or passenger's home city in the event of a terminated cruise. The cruise line has taken care of flights and said it was looking into transportation via boat, bus and train for passengers who didn't want to fly back to the departure point of Baltimore, the company announced via Twitter. In an age when nearly everyone has a smartphone to record incidents as they are occurring, cruise lines should be prepared for passengers to share what happens aboard ship. ""If you have any kind of problem, don't think it's not going to find its way into the mainstream press,"" said Carolyn Spencer Brown, editor-in-chief of cruise travel site CruiseCritic.com. Royal Caribbean officials understood that new reality. Transparency wins over passengers . ""Nothing says a cruise line has to break the information on Twitter,"" the way Royal Caribbean is doing, Spencer Brown said. ""Those are impressive photos they're tweeting out. Yes, they have the happy picture with passengers. But they also tweeted out (a picture of) Deck 6 that was charred and burned. I love the transparency. "" Spencer Brown says the company's strategy appears to be working. ""Passengers are already saying (publicly) that they felt comforted and confident about their safety during this trying episode,"" she said. ""Doing the right thing is the best way to control what people say about you. Since you know the information is going to come out, be transparent and get ahead of the story."" Lessons were probably learned from Carnival Cruise Line's handling of recent problems aboard the Carnival Triumph and Dream and the capsizing of the Costa Cruises Concordia. (Carnival Corp. owns Carnival Cruise Lines and Costa Cruises.) Politicians and passengers criticized Carnival's public response. And in March, U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller asked that the company repay the government for at least $4.2 million for the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy costs associated with two Carnival incidents. In April, Carnival announced that it would ""voluntarily"" reimburse the U.S. Treasury but didn't name a dollar amount. The bad publicity is what led to the industry's announcement, says maritime lawyer Robert Peltz. ""I believe the cruise line industry bill of rights is window dressing designed to distract attention from the Carnival Triumph, Carnival Splendor and the Costa Concordia incidents,"" Peltz said. Missing from the bill of rights? Royal Caribbean tends to respond to its passengers' concerns, says Peltz, but he would like to see stronger industry-wide provisions protecting passengers in the event of injury or death aboard ship or on third-party or cruise company shore excursions. The current bill of rights doesn't mention those issues. The cruise association's new passenger bill of rights, announced May 22, applies to 26 North American member cruise lines and applies to cruises purchased in North America on those lines, regardless of itinerary. The association plans to request global recognition of the new policy from the International Maritime Organization. CNN.com commenter Graeme McIntosh, who says he has sailed on 15 cruises throughout the Caribbean, Alaska, South America and the East Coast and has never experienced an incident, agreed that the bill of rights is ""a damage control measure drafted by the industry."" McIntosh, a fire and safety consultant in Toronto, would like to see crew and passengers required to take muster drills more seriously (no drinking or partying for passengers) and require surprise drills that take into account how passengers would respond to locked doors and blocked stairwells. He applauded passengers using smartphones to capture events as they happen. ""They can assist investigators with establishing a time line of events and show the actions of occupants and crew during a real situation."" Cruising enthusiast and CNN.commenter Aubrey Pruis isn't cynical about the industry's move to adopt a bill of rights. ""Yes, the cruise lines are hard at work protecting/salvaging their public image in the face of tragedy, but on the same note, cruise lines do seem to take tragic matters seriously as demonstrated in how they take immediate action to remedy any given situation."" ""I do think this will have a positive impact on the cruise industry and the public will continue to take cruises,"" he wrote via e-mail. ""I know I will.""","Royal Caribbean tweeted news about ship fire early and often .

"(CNN) -- In one of the clinics in Arsal, a young fighter asks that we conceal his identity, going simply by the name Ahmed. Three years ago, when Syria's revolution had not yet morphed into the brutal war it is today, the 20-year-old was still in high school. His ambition in life was to be a doctor, but a year-and-a-half ago that all changed. ""We reached a point where if we don't fight, we will get killed, it was the only option,"" Ahmed tells us, one hand rubbing against the bandages swathed around his waist. ""If I don't fight for my country then who is going to?"" Ahmed was wounded during the fighting for the town of Yabroud, just across the border. ""It's a strategic area, it's a main access route to get the wounded out and the medical and other aid in,"" Dr. Kasem Zein explains, as he checks Ahmed's wounds. Pleas for mercy . In pre-revolution Syria Dr. Zein was a gastroenterologist, hardly equipped to deal with war wounds ranging from bullets to severed limbs. The doctor is a familiar face, known to us in the media and the world from countless YouTube videos during the fighting for the town of Qusair. Often overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of casualties Dr. Zein would broadcast impassioned pleas for mercy, for help, but none came. He spent more than two years apart from this family. Over the summer when Qusair, due to an influx of hardened Hezbollah fighters fell back to the regime, Dr. Zein fled to Lebanon. ""It's not just a war with weapons -- it's a war on our soul, our psyche,"" he says. ""It's all death, but at least here it is slightly more gentle."" Increasing tensions . Arsal was once a sleepy border town tucked amidst the mountainous terrain of Lebanon's eastern frontier with Syria. The flow of Syrian refugees has seen the town's population roughly triple, makeshift camps seeping into any open space or empty lot. Lebanon hit the one million registered Syrian refugee mark last week. The number is on track to hit 1.5 million, according to the UN. This in a country whose own population is 4.4 million. Aid agencies can offer little. The United Nations' refugee agency, the UNHCR, says it only has $242 million of the $1.89 billion needed just for the Syrian refugee crisis in Lebanon alone. Some towns house more Syrians than Lebanese, and while many Lebanese sympathize with the plight of the Syrians, the strain being put on this tiny nation is unsustainable and tensions are increasing. Lives forever scarred . Arsal finds itself in the crosshairs of the Syrian war, a Sunni enclave in Lebanon's Shi'a Bekka valley -- Hezbollah's stronghold. Hezbollah dispatched its fighters to battle alongside the Assad regime, its hardened fighters allowing the Syrian government to reclaim key towns and territory close to the Lebanese border, choking-off key supply lines for the rebels, and sending masses streaming into Lebanon. Lives lost, lives forever scarred, a population that hardly recognizes its homeland or in many cases even itself, thrown into the midst of unimaginable violence, adapting to survive. In one of the newest refugee camps on the outskirts of Arsal, under a rusty Ferris wheel, the youngest residents dart through large chunks of limestone. The men gather around us, angry, desperate, frustrated. ""Is this a way to live?"" one man demands. ""If we were animals the world would have more compassion.""","The Lebanese town of Arsal lies just across the border from war-torn Syria .

"(CNN) -- France and the United States put their support behind a new coalition of Syrian dissidents Tuesday, but Damascus slammed the group, saying any effort to topple President Bashar al-Assad will be futile. French President Francois Hollande said his nation ""recognizes the Syrian national coalition as the sole representative of the Syrian people and therefore as the provisional government of the future democratic Syria, making it possible to bring Bashar al-Assad's regime to an end."" In Washington, a deputy spokesman for the State Department said the U.S. believes the decision to unite opposition groups marks the start of a democratic future for the Syrian people. The U.S. has yet to formally recognize the group, though, as a representative government. Artists tackle Syria's brutal civil war . ""We're going to work with them in the coming days to ensure that our humanitarian and nonlethal assistance serves the needs of the Syrian people,"" Mark Toner told reporters. Hollande, however, said the issue of arming the rebels ""will have to be renewed"" in nations that back the new National Coalition Forces of the Syrian Revolution. The Syrian government remained defiant. ""There is no power in this entire world that can defeat Syria because we have a valiant military and our noble people believe in our cause,"" Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi said, according to the state-run Tishreen news agency. ""Defending Syria is a national destiny and not a political option."" He also described dissidents outside Syria as ""nothing but an empty bubble."" ""The opposition abroad is clinically dead, and they are in a state of turmoil,"" al-Zoubi said. The latest insults in the Syrian civil war came days after opposition factions formally agreed in Qatar to unite on Sunday. Five signs the war in Syria is changing . After 20 months of relentless turmoil, rebel forces had not had a unified vision for the country or single military plan to oust al-Assad, whose family has ruled Syria for more than four decades. The United States and Arab nations pressured the groups to get on the same page. The new coalition agreed that it wants al-Assad gone and that no one would talk with his government. Spokesman Mohammed Dugham said the only option now is a totally new government. On Monday, the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council endorsed the coalition. Despite the opposition's unification efforts -- and in light of the government's defiance -- the bloody civil war rages on. At least 172 people died Tuesday, including 109 people in the Damascus region, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Arab League recognizes new Syrian opposition coalition . The U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday it is working to provide aid to residents who have fled Syria. ""The number of Syrian refugees registered or awaiting registration throughout the surrounding region has now surpassed 407,000 and continues to climb. There are tens of thousands more Syrians around the region who have not registered. Many are expected to come forward for registration and assistance in the coming weeks as winter sets in and their resources run out,"" the agency said. Doctors Without Borders said it has treated more than 2,500 patients at four new hospitals in northern Syria since June. Doctors have conducted 550 surgical procedures, the charity group said.

"(CNN) -- A 75-year-old Australian missionary who traveled to North Korea as part of a tour group has been detained there, his wife said. John Short had with him some Gospel tracts in Korean ""which seem to be at the core of the detention,"" his wife said in a statement Wednesday. ""It is alleged he is being asked questions such as, 'Who sent you?', 'To what organization do you belong?', 'Who translated this material into Korean?'"" his wife, Karen Short, said. North Korea hasn't so far commented on the reported detention. Short, who lives in Hong Kong, went to Pyongyang on Saturday. The next night, police questioned him at his hotel and took him into custody, according to the statement. His family found out about the detention only after another member of the group returned to China on Tuesday. ""He has been the only source of information,"" the wife's statement said. Short has been arrested multiple times while doing evangelical work in China ""for speaking out about brutality against Chinese Christians,"" according to a biography on a religious website named Gospel Attract. In the 1990s, he became ""persona non grata"" with Chinese authorities for almost two years and was unable to visit mainland China, the biography said. The Australian consulate in Hong Kong said the Australian government is aware of the report. Since Australia does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea, the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang is handling representations on its behalf. Last year, North Korea sentenced Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American, to 15 years of hard labor on charges he planned to topple the government through religious activities. Washington has repeatedly called on Pyongyang to release Bae, expressing concerns about his health. But Kim Jong Un's regime has so far refused to budge. Bae, 45, was widely reported to have been carrying out missionary work in North Korea. His family says he ran a company specializing in tours of the secretive country. North Korea has a number of state-controlled churches, but the authoritarian Communist regime doesn't tolerate independent religious activities. The regime ""considers the spread of Christianity a particularly serious threat, since it challenges ideologically the official personality cult and provides a platform for social and political organization and interaction outside the realm of the state,"" a United Nations panel said in a report released this week. ""People caught practicing Christianity are subject to severe punishments in violation of the right to freedom of religion and the prohibition of religious discrimination,"" the report by the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea said. CNN's Tim Schwarz, Jethro Mullen and Chieu Luu contributed to this report.","John Short, 75, had with him some Gospel tracts, his wife says .

"(CNN) -- International criticism swiftly and robustly censured the decision by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to block access to social networking website Twitter. European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes called the ban ""groundless, pointless, cowardly"" and the U.S. State Department likened it to ""21st century book burning."" But Erdogan is less concerned about what the ""international community says"" and more determined to stem the seemingly unstoppable leaking of illicit audio recordings posted on Twitter and YouTube, allegedly documenting corruption in the highest echelons of the Turkish government, ahead of next Sunday's municipal elections. Twitter is gaining popularity in Turkey as a forum for unhindered debate and information at the expense of traditional sources of news. It played a critical role in mobilizing opposition to Erdogan during last summer's Gezi Park protests. And no wonder -- media freedom in Turkey has plummeted from 98th to 154th position worldwide since 2006, according to Reporters Without Borders. Publicity surrounding the Twitter ban notwithstanding, one should be careful not to exaggerate the near term impacts of this policy move. Research company Emarketer estimates that a mere 15% of Turkish citizens are Twitter users. This statistic suggests that Twitter use is limited to a small segment of tech-savvy and globally-connected Turks -- a fact that partly explains why they had the technical acumen to circumvent the ban and actually boosted Twitter usage by 33%, as revealed by social media rating agency Somera. More broadly, the vast majority of the Erdogan's core supporters -- religious and conservative Turks -- are probably not avid Twitter fans. Their main concern is not media freedom or the pervasiveness of corruption but bread-and-butter economic issues. Ali Carkoglu, a political scientist at Istanbul-based Koc University, notes that popular perceptions of the state of the economy have not deteriorated significantly  implying that while Erdogan may lose some votes, he is likely to largely retain his base of support in Turkey's upcoming elections. Opinion: Twitter ban is the least of Turkey's woes . What the Twitter ban indicates is that the Turkish leadership psychology is incapable of tackling effectively the myriad serious political, economic and external challenges facing the country. It does not appear inclined to implement structural and liberalizing reforms to prevent a ""middle income trap"" -- in other words a slow growth regime -- from taking hold. As I argued in a recent Chatham House report, in the absence of these reforms Turkish growth rates of 3% or lower will become the norm rather than the exception. Turkey is addicted to continuous flows of fickle global capital and external debt to fund private consumption. Its economy suffers from persistently high current account deficits, meaning that imports vastly outpace exports and cannot be paid for by the low levels of domestic savings. Unwisely, Turkey's focus on hubristic construction projects such as the third Istanbul airport and its capricious use of the law to suppress Twitter, rather than competitiveness and innovation, will most likely further undermine future business plans and -- critically -- the confidence of foreign investors. Turkey's brand, which was on the rise during the first decade of this century, has witnessed a formidable hammering in the Middle East and North Africa. Very few in the region now look to Turkey as an inspiration for liberal politics and open markets. Tunisia has primarily supplanted Turkey on the consolidation of democracy, despite the latter's six decades of electoral experience. Turkey is a vivid illustration that personality-based top-down governance and fragile institutions are not a recipe for political maturity and lasting economic success. This strategically-located nation of 76 million people demonstrates the time-honored principle that ""absolute power corrupts absolutely"" and reinforces Winston Churchill's dictum that ""democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.""

"(CNN) -- White House hopeful Mitt Romney will tell Americans Thursday morning as he seeks to become the nation's first Mormon president that he shares the same ""moral convictions"" as other people of faith. GOP White House hopeful Mitt Romney says his address won't be a ""JFK speech."" The former Massachusetts governor is delivering the speech to address religion's role in government but also to address concerns voters might have about the Mormon religion. In excerpts released Thursday morning, Romney talks about the shared convictions of all faiths. But he resists those who would have him explain his own faith. ""There are some who would have a presidential candidate describe and explain his church's distinctive doctrines. To do so would enable the very religious test the founders prohibited in the Constitution,"" according to the excerpt. ""No candidate should become the spokesman for his faith. For if he becomes president, he will need the prayers of the people of all faiths."" The GOP contender has brushed off comparisons between his speech and John F. Kennedy's famous address about his religious beliefs, insisting it won't be a flashback to 1960. ""I'm not going to be giving a JFK speech,"" Romney said. ""He gave the definitive speech on discrimination relating to a political campaign, and what he said makes sense to me. I'm going to be talking about the role of religion and faith in America, in a free society."" However, he added, ""I certainly will answer some questions related to how my own faith will inform my presidency.""  Watch why Romney's faith could trouble some voters » . The GOP candidate's campaign announced on Sunday his plans for the speech on ""Faith in America."" Romney will give the address at 10:30 a.m. ET at former President George H. W. Bush's presidential library in College Station, Texas. About 300 people -- a combination of friends, family and religious and conservative leaders -- will be in the audience, according to a campaign spokesperson.   Watch what's behind Romney's decision to talk about faith » . Nearly a half century earlier, Kennedy took the stage in Houston, Texas, and addressed concerns that the Vatican would influence his policies. ""But because I am a Catholic, and no Catholic has ever been elected president, the real issues in this campaign have been obscured -- perhaps deliberately, in some quarters less responsible than this,"" Kennedy said before Southern Baptist leaders on September 12, 1960.  Watch Kennedy describe the 'real issues' of his time » . ""It is apparently necessary for me to state once again -- not what kind of church I believe in, for that should be important only to me -- but what kind of America I believe in,"" he said, adding ""I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute."" Kennedy's move was daring. He had come under attack for his Catholic upbringing, and he was tackling the issue before an audience of Southern Baptists. ""Given the closeness of the vote, you could easily make the argument that JFK won because of that speech,"" said CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider. The man who wants to become the first Mormon president faces a different religious climate. Nearly 77 percent of those questioned in an October CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll said the fact that a candidate is a Mormon would not be a factor in the way they vote for president. But a significant portion -- 19 percent -- said they are less likely to vote for a Mormon. ""Those who have the biggest problem supporting a Mormon are church-going and evangelical Christians -- particularly those who believe that Mormonism is not a Christian religion,"" Schneider said, citing the October poll.  What do Mormons believe? » . And that also represents a large portion of the Republican base. Kennedy wasn't viewed as a prominent player in Catholic circles. He told the Texas crowd, ""I am not the Catholic candidate for President. I am the Democratic Party's candidate for President who happens also to be a Catholic.""  Watch Kennedy promise to separate his religion's views from his own » . ""Non-Catholics expected Kennedy to say his faith would make no difference, which is hardly what today's Republican Christian conservatives want to hear,"" religion reporter Dick Ostling said in an interview with ReligionWriter. Romney, however, is active in his church. At age 19, he became a full-time missionary of the Mormon church, temporarily leaving college to fulfill a Mormon calling and eventually becoming the equivalent of a bishop. Romney later made a fortune in the business world, and played a big role in the financial success of the 2002 Olympic winter games. In 2002, he defeated the Democrats and became governor of traditionally liberal Massachusetts. In 1960, Kennedy was already the Democratic Party nominee when he made his famous speech. Romney, on the other hand, has yet to seal his party's nomination. He is still vying for his party's vote, and the evangelical Christian vote in particular, which some say puts him in a more difficult position than Kennedy. ""Romney will address deeply committed religious Republicans and tell them, 'My values are the same as yours, even if we belong to different churches,' '' Schneider said. Brushing off differences between Mormons and other Christians is not the best campaign strategy, according to Ostling in RW. ""Better to candidly admit there are differences but these should not affect voting decisions,"" Ostling told RW. ""The more effective plea is tolerance, asking voters to follow the spirit of the Constitution's ban on any 'religious test' to hold public office."" The Salt Lake City-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints claims about 12 million adherents worldwide, roughly half of them in the United States. Followers consider themselves Christians, but elements of Mormon theology -- that the Garden of Eden was located in what is now Missouri, that a lost tribe of Israelites settled in North America and that a resurrected Jesus Christ visited them -- differ sharply from orthodox Christian belief. The church's early belief in polygamy fueled its persecution as followers migrated across the United States, but church leaders banned the practice in 1890.

"(CNN) -- You've probably heard that the Turkish government's attempt to ban Twitter quickly collapsed into farce. From USA Today: . ""More than 2.5 million tweets -- or over 17,000 per minute -- were reportedly posted (from Turkey) in the first 24 hours after the ban, according to several media reports. HootSuite, a Vancouver, Canada-based startup that measures and analyzes Twitter marketing campaigns, said in a corporate blog post that its traffic from Turkey tripled in the first day after the ban. So ... all is good, right? Not right. Turkey is a NATO ally, a candidate for membership in the European Union, a front-line state facing Iran, Syria and Russia -- and it is heading seriously in the wrong direction. A lot of people have invested a lot of time and effort denying that unwelcome news. It can be denied no longer. Turkey's Twitter-banning prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, came to power after a big election win in 2002. Erdogan's party was staunchly Islamic, yet seemingly committed to electoral democracy. Its victory was hailed by many as a hopeful sign for the post-9/11 world. Europe had Christian Democratic parties; why couldn't Turkey have a Muslim Democratic party? Indeed, Erdogan-style Muslim Democracy seemed a decade ago the striking alternative to radical Islamism, a political alternative that would integrate religion into politics while preserving individual freedom and democratic decision-making. Erdogan and his Islamic regime lifted restrictions on the wearing of hijab in public buildings. He abolished the daily pledge of allegiance to a secular Turkey required in all Turkish schools since 1933. He downgraded the longstanding Turkish relationship with Israel and mused instead about a ""neo-Ottoman"" role for Turkey at the head of the Middle East's Muslim nations. He and his party passed restrictions on the sale and promotion of alcohol and boldly disavowed the equality of the sexes. At the same time, the Erdogan government did initiate important economic liberation of Turkey's traditionally state-led economy. He made concessions to ethnic and religious minorities. It seemed imaginable that Erdogan's reactionary religious message could somehow be fused with modern economics and tolerance. President Barack Obama certainly imagined so: In a 2012 interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, the President cited Prime Minister Erdogan as one of the five foreign leaders with whom he'd forged his closest ""bonds of trust"". Yet from the start, Erdogan's Islamic democracy had a strongly authoritarian whiff to it. Through the Erdogan years, Turkey has led the world in the number of journalists jailed, ahead of both China and Iran. Erdogan's government banned YouTube for two years beginning in 2007, purged and jailed hundreds of politically uncongenial military officers and reshaped both police and the judiciary. Turkish voters overlooked and forgave these infringements. They elected and twice re-elected Erdogan. Turkey achieved genuine economic progress during his rule. Ordinary Turks believed that their blunt, traditionalist prime minister cherished their interests in a way his more cosmopolitan predecessors did not. Then came the swirl of corruption rumors, corruption on a massive multi-billion dollar scale. Police fired tear gas and water cannon at people protesting the death of a 15-year-old boy who died in demonstrations against development of Gezi Park in central Istanbul. Audio was posted to social media that purported to reveal the prime minister in plots with his son to collect and conceal tens of millions of Euros in illegal cash. (Erdogan has claimed that a corruption investigation that entangled four of his former cabinet ministers is a ""coup plot"" and that some of the recordings are ""immorally edited material"".) Erdogan has responded with more censorship and more controls, culminating in the Twitter ban. That ban failed -- yet the underlying problem remains: the country that was once the West's most reliable partner in the Islamic world is not so reliable any more. Turkey defies embargoes to trade with Iran. Turkish foreign policy has sought to build relationships with everyone and anyone except Turkey's traditional Western partners: with Syria, China, Russia, anyone. With Russia's seizure of Crimea, the once-exotic and once-remote Black Sea region has suddenly emerged as a central global zone of conflict. Time was when the United States and the Western world could count on a steady, responsible and democratizing ally on the south shore of that sea. No more. The Twitter ban has collapsed. All the bad impulses that imposed that Twitter ban remain in place -- and will remain so long as Erdogan remains in office. The promise of an Islamic version of Christian Democracy has proved a big lie. Instead, the country that was once the most stable, reliable and democratic state in the Islamic world seems now to have cast itself as the region's saddest backward-slider -- with its ever more authoritarian leader playing the role of an Islamic Vladimir Putin, or maybe Eva Peron. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Turkey once gave people hope for the future of democracy in Islamic nations .

"(CNN) -- George Zimmerman, charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, had a ""little hero complex"" but was not a racist, a Sanford, Florida, homicide investigator told federal agents, according to reports released Thursday. In an interview with FBI agents in March, investigator Chris Serino told authorities he ""believed that Zimmerman's actions were not based on Martin's skin color, rather based on his attire, the total circumstances of the encounter and the previous burglary suspects in the community,"" according to an FBI report. The reports and other information in the case against Zimmerman were released Thursday by Special Prosecutor Angela Corey to Zimmerman's attorney. The U.S. Department of Justice took up a civil rights investigation after allegations that race played a part in the killing of Martin, 17, in February in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. The reports released Thursday do not draw conclusions in that investigation. Read the FBI reports (PDF) Martin's family and supporters say Zimmerman racially profiled the teen, describing him as ""suspicious"" during a 911 call and ignoring a police dispatcher's request that he not follow him. The 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer has said he killed Martin in self-defense, saying the teen punched him and slammed his head into a sidewalk before the shooting, according to family members and police. Trayvon Martin memorial removed but preserved . Among the evidence released Thursday are details about federal interviews with more than 30 people, including key members of the Sanford Police Department and Zimmerman's neighbors and co-workers. In his interview, Serino explained to the FBI agents that African-American gangs in the community ""typically dressed in black and wore hoodies,"" the report said. ""Serino believes that when Zimmerman saw Martin in a hoody (sic), Zimmerman took it upon himself to view Martin as acting suspicious,"" the report said. ""Serino described Zimmerman as overzealous and as having 'a little hero complex,' but not as a racist. Serino explained that on numerous occasions he asked Zimmerman specifically if he followed Martin based on his skin color and Zimmerman never admitted to this fact."" In June, Sanford police said Serino had voluntarily asked to be moved from detective to patrol officer. At the time, police Sgt. David Morgenstern said the move was not a demotion and that he did not know why Serino made the request. Many of Zimmerman's neighbors, whose identities are redacted, told federal agents they did not know him. Those who did had nothing derogatory to say about him. Similarly, interviewed co-workers were complimentary of Zimmerman. Several noted an incident in which a lock Zimmerman used to attach his orthopedic chair to his desk was cut, but said he handled it appropriately and professionally. One apparent co-worker, whose identity was redacted, told agents she saw Zimmerman as he was waiting to speak to human resources the Monday after the shooting and noticed his injuries. The woman told agents that Zimmerman was ""absolutely emotionally devastated."" A timeline of events . Another FBI report documents a March 30 interview with a store owner who contacted authorities to say Zimmerman had contacted him about two weeks earlier ""in reference to purchasing a new firearm."" Zimmerman told the owner, whose identity was redacted, that ""his life is in danger and he needs more guns,"" the report said. It was unclear from the report whether Zimmerman purchased the firearm. The evidence also included audio of conversations between 911 dispatchers and Sanford police. The dispatcher tells officers to look for a ""black male, late teens, wearing a dark gray hoodie and sweatpants, walking around,"" adding that the youth was last seen running toward the back of the neighborhood. Then, says the dispatcher, ""There's screaming and a gunshot, are you responding?"" Dispatchers later tell responding officers they have received a total of four calls regarding the incident. ""Someone's laying in the backyard,"" a dispatcher says. ""I need somebody ASAP,"" an officer says on the recording. ""I've got one down with a gunshot wound, and I've got one secure."" Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" on Thursday evening that the question of Zimmerman's attitudes on race was not pertinent. ""None of that matters to why this armed watchman with a 9 mm gun got out of his car and chased an unarmed teenager and shot him in the heart,"" said Crump. ""The fact I wear a hoodie doesn't justify you killing me,"" he told Burnett. Also released Thursday were reports on interviews with agents of the Florida Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, who arrested Zimmerman in 2005 on suspicion of battery against a law enforcement officer and obstruction of justice. The agents told authorities that Zimmerman did not use racial slurs or discriminatory language during the incident, the reports said. The charges against Zimmerman, who was accused of pushing an undercover agent, were later dropped after he entered a pretrial diversion program and completed an anger management class. A report on an interview with Zimmerman's ex-fiance was also released. The woman told authorities that while she and Zimmerman had physical altercations and at one point filed restraining orders against one another, she never saw Zimmerman exhibit any other violence or exhibit any racial bias. Additionally, details about Zimmerman's MySpace account, surveillance video and e-mails between Zimmerman and ousted Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee were released as part of the evidence handover. On the MySpace account in the name of ""Joe G.,"" Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, recalls moving from Manassas, Virginia, saying, ""I don't miss driving around scared to hit Mexicans walkin on the side of the street, soft ass wanna be thugs messin with peoples cars when they ain't around (what are you provin, that you can dent a car when no ones watchin) don't make you a man in my book. Working 96 hours to get a decent pay check, getting knifes pulled on you by every Mexican you run into."" Also released were copies of the e-mails between Zimmerman and Lee before the shooting regarding the neighborhood watch program. Zimmerman, in the e-mails, notes there has been a ""spike in robberies and home invasions in the neighborhood within the past two months."" He adds that he has not had a positive view of Sanford police because of the ""Sherman Ware incident."" Ware, a black homeless man, was beaten by a Sanford police lieutenant's son. Zimmerman was critical of police handling of the case and reportedly worked on Ware's behalf. Zimmerman was released on $1 million bond last week. An initial bond of $150,000 was revoked last month after a judge learned that Zimmerman and his wife failed to disclose more than $150,000 in donations from the public. Shooting leaves community divided .

"(CNN) -- As young children, the stress and burden of our life-threatening allergies to a range of common foods, including nuts, seafood, shellfish, eggs and other substances, really fell on our parents more than us. Like many kids, we were unaware and felt invincible. We didn't worry too much about managing our allergies. That changed after the first severe allergic reaction either of us had. Evan was playing at a friend's house when he ate what he had been assured was a ""fake peanut."" Almost immediately, it was apparent that something was very, very wrong. Luckily, his friend's dad also happened to be Evan's doctor; he treated him immediately, and the incident was resolved. Life-threatening allergies were much less common when we went to school, so we really stood out as the ""strange twins with allergies"" -- those guys who had to sit at a separate table by themselves at lunchtime. It is unfortunate that severe allergies are much more widespread now, but there is a silver lining: People and organizations are more aware and better able to support the children and adults who suffer. The idea to develop a new epinephrine auto-injector (commonly known as an EpiPen), specifically designed for the needs of patients like us, came about the summer after we graduated high school. We were on our way to a family vacation in Europe, and it looked as if, once again, the two of us had not packed our EpiPens. They were too bulky so we often didn't carry them. After the usual finger-pointing and questions about why we didn't carry something that could save our lives, the idea of developing a smaller, more portable type of epinephrine auto-injector was born. At the time, we had recently selected our college majors. (Evan went into the engineering program at the University of Virginia, and Eric chose pre-med/medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University.) We decided to customize our education to develop the skills necessary to make this invention a reality. At the start of each school year we reviewed our course options and decided together which classes to take that would help us achieve our goal. Our first real funding came from winning a collegiate inventors' grant from the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance. It was at that point we knew we were on our way. Soon after we confirmed what we had already suspected: that developing a new pharmaceutical product is extremely complicated. To do it successfully would require deep industry expertise. We founded Intelliject, which now has a leadership team with more than 100 years of combined experience in the pharmaceutical industry. We are fortunate to work with a team of industry veterans who are just as committed to patients as we are. As we say, the patients are the real experts -- we just need to create the opportunities to capture their insight and design products that truly address their needs. Our entire approach puts the user at the center of development from the beginning of the process. It is hard to describe the feeling now that Auvi-Q -- the epinephrine auto-injector that is a culmination of the ideas we had all those years ago -- is available in pharmacies across the United States (and as Allerject in Canada). If you had asked us on the day of the launch in January, we would have told you that it simply can't get any better than this. But we were wrong. About a month after Auvi-Q's launch, we read a Facebook post in which a mother described how her daughter had a severe allergic reaction. She described how Auvi-Q helped her by ""having a voice walking through the steps in an emergency situation."" In her opinion, Auvi-Q saved her daughter's life. We can confidently say that there is no better feeling than that.","Evan and Eric Edwards developed Auvi-Q, which launched in January .

"(CNN) -- It seems Christina Aguilera needs to plan for a wedding and a baby. A week after the singer and ""The Voice"" coach revealed that she's engaged to boyfriend Matt Rutler, multiple reports suggest that they're also expecting their first child together. Aguilera, 33, and Rutler, 29, have been dating since 2010, following Aguilera's breakup with her ex-husband, Jordan Bratman. The powerhouse vocalist welcomed her 6-year-old son, Max, with Bratman in 2008. Although Aguilera was eager to share news of her engagement -- she posted a photo of her sparkling ring on Twitter on February 14 -- she has yet to say a peep about the pregnancy reports. It appears someone close to the star is talking, though: People magazine quotes an insider who says that Aguilera and Rutler are ""very much in love and are really excited to take this next step."" At least the singer will have some downtime to adjust to her latest life changes: While she's a regular on ""The Voice,"" she's taking off season 6, which premieres on February 24, as singer Shakira takes her place.","Christina Aguilera is reportedly expecting her second child .

"Sharpes, Florida (CNN) -- For most, jail may well be an unpleasant experience. Some facilities are rough and tough places, serving bad food and filled with a whole host of society's underachievers. Meanwhile, one Florida jail is being sued by one of its inmates who says he's being tortured -- because he has to watch the same movies over and over again. ""It's a lot like Chinese water torture,"" said James Poulin. In an interview with CNN affiliate Central Florida News 13, Poulin said that the Brevard County Detention Center's inmates aren't able to watch regular television and are forced to watch the same movies repeatedly. Movies like wartime epics ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and ""Black Hawk Down,"" and the holiday classic ""Polar Express,"" with its boisterous children on a speeding train. ""I hear those little kids screaming through my brain. All night long I can hear them,"" Poulin said . ""I can close my eyes, but I'm still going to hear them over and over and over,"" he added. Poulin has been at the jail for almost four years now, so it's not too surprising that he's seen a couple of the features more than once. He's been there since early 2007, when he was charged in a DUI crash that killed his female passenger. Poulin should have been at the jail only a short time, but he's filed 15 court motions for continuances, which have delayed his trial. He's also filed six lawsuits against the jail. All the previous lawsuits have been dismissed except one in which he demands access to newspapers and publications. ""We're not preventing him from receiving any material,"" said Commander Susan Jeter of the Brevard County jail. ""He just has to get a subscription and pay for it,"" she told CNN. But magazines and newspapers are taking a back seat to Poulin's complaints in a new lawsuit that he has to watch the same movies again and again. Jeter says that tough economic times have affected the jail's budget, just like they've affected most people's budgets. When the broadcast networks switched over to digital technology, the jail would have been forced to purchase new TV equipment. As a savings move, the jail decided to keep its old TVs and DVD players, thereby losing the ability to get TV channels. ""We decided to do things more constructively,"" said Jeter. Jail officials restructured their program to offer more educational DVDs, as a way to help the inmates. ""We try to keep them informed, and provide something that could keep them from getting AIDS or hepatitis....instead of watching Jerry Springer,"" said Jeter. Jeter says that historical DVDs are often followed by movies about the period. So, movies like ""Saving Private Ryan, and ""Black Hawk Down,"" have gotten some play. But that doesn't appear to be good enough for Poulin. It seems he doesn't necessarily have to have his MTV, but he does crave just plain TV. ""The jail has the necessary equipment already to go ahead and give us regular TV,"" he said. ""We have a right to the media in jail,"" he said. Jail officials say that in the time that live TV access has been gone from the jail, inmate-on-inmate violence is way down. ""There are families that don't even have cable TV . We can't bring it in for his (Poulin's) benefit, at the taxpayers' expense,"" said Jeter. ""He doesn't have to watch it,"" she said of the movies programming. ""He can go in his room and close the door. He can read a book. No one forces him to watch."" ""When you have someone here as long as him, he is going to see a rerun.""","A Florida jail inmate says watching the jail's few movies over and over is ""torture""

"(CNN) -- A 15-year-old boy who survived a flight from California to Hawaii by hitching a ride in the plane's wheel well said he was trying to get to Somalia to see his mother, a law enforcement official told CNN on Tuesday. He remains in a hospital in Hawaii, Kayla Rosenfeld, a spokeswoman for the state's Department of Human Services, said Tuesday afternoon. The teen, who has not yet been identified, spent more than six hours on the ground before the Maui-bound jet took off, another government official says. The boy jumped an airport fence in San Jose, California, shortly after 1 a.m. on Sunday, hours before Hawaiian Airlines Flight 45 took off at 7:55 a.m., the official said. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, didn't know when the teen climbed into the wheel well, but said the plane already was at the airport at 1 a.m. Investigators say they don't think the teen knew where the plane was heading and just went to the nearest aircraft. Teen stowaway raises questions about airport security . Authorities said the boy came out of the wheel well of the Boeing 767 about an hour after it landed at the Kahului Airport on the island of Maui. He is in the custody of child welfare services workers, said Kayla Rosenfeld, a spokeswoman for the state's Department of Human Services. The teen told authorities he was from Santa Clara, California, and ran away from home on Sunday, FBI Special Agent Tom Simon said. Emanuael Golla, a senior at Santa Clara High School who told CNN he had met the boy but isn't good friends with him, described him as extremely shy and quiet and said he had just transferred to the school within the past few weeks. The boy told authorities that he crawled into the wheel well and lost consciousness when the plane took off. He survived the nearly five-hour flight in subzero temperatures at oxygen-depleted heights -- as high as 38,000 feet -- against the odds, authorities believe. Since 1947, 105 people are known to have attempted to fly inside wheel wells on 94 flights worldwide, the Federal Aviation Administration's Civil Aerospace Medical Institute says. Of those, 25 made it through, including a 9-year-old -- a survival rate of 24%. One of the flights went as high as 39,000 feet. Two others were at 38,000 feet. The conditions at high altitudes can put stowaways in a virtual ""hibernative"" state, the FAA said. 5 stowaway attempts that didn't end tragically .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Protests outside the U.S. Embassy in Cairo continued into Friday, after U.S. President Barack Obama issued what is being seen as a stern warning to Egypt that relations between the two countries will be shaped by ""how they respond to this incident."" ""I don't think that we would consider them an ally, but we don't consider them an enemy,"" Obama told Telemundo in an interview to be aired Thursday night. ""They're a new government that is trying to find its way. They were democratically elected. I think that we are going to have to see how they respond to this incident."" In the interview, recorded Wednesday, Obama said that if Egypt takes actions that ""indicate they're not taking responsibilities, as all other countries do where we have embassies, I think that's going to be a real big problem."" Meanwhile, violent protests -- sparked by outrage over an anti-Islam film made in the United States and posted online -- marked their fourth day in Cairo. The film, which denigrates the Prophet Mohammed, has sparked protests across the region. Clouds of tear gas wafted over the hulks of burned-out cars Thursday as hundreds of demonstrators battled police 300 yards from the embassy. The demonstrators threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at police and chanted, ""With our souls, with our blood, we will sacrifice for you, Prophet Mohammed."" At least 224 people were injured, according to Egyptian state television, Nile TV. Six things to know about the Benghazi attack . Images from Friday morning showed throngs of people still massed in the area, with authorities stationed in front of them, under a dark sky. While there was ample activity and apparent commotion, there was no audible chanting or notable clashes evident between authorities and protesters. The protests, and Obama's comments, come during a delicate period in the relationship between the United States and Egypt under Mohammed Morsy, the country's first democratically elected leader since the overthrow last year of longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak. They also come amid heightened tensions at U.S. diplomatic missions in the Middle East and North Africa following Tuesday's attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that left Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other American consular officials dead. That same day, police and Egyptian troops formed defensive lines around the embassy to prevent demonstrators who had also gathered there from advancing, but not before the protesters had scaled the embassy fence and placed a black flag atop a ladder in the American compound. Police arrested four protesters, but the failure of Egyptian authorities to take action sooner has been widely questioned. Some also questioned President Morsy's response. He initially focused his criticism on the film as an unacceptable slap at Islam. Ambassador's killing shines light on Muslim sensitivities around Prophet Mohammed . ""The presidency condemns in the strongest terms the attempt of a group to insult the place of the Messenger, the Prophet Mohammed ... and condemns the people who have produced this radical work,"" the president said in a statement posted on his Facebook page. ""The Egyptian people, both Muslims and Christians, refuse such insults on sanctities."" But after speaking with Obama in what the White House described as a review of the ""strategic partnership between the United States and Egypt,"" Morsy directly criticized the attacks for the first time Thursday. ""Those who are attacking the embassies do not represent any of us,"" he said in comments from Brussels, Belgium, where he was visiting the headquarters of the European Union. Obama's comments were widely seen as a warning to Egypt, which under Mubarak was widely considered a staunch U.S. ally and remains a major recipient of American foreign aid. ""I think it was a little bit of a strange choice of words to say that Egypt is not an ally,"" Atlantic Council analyst Michelle Dunne said. ""But I think that his purpose is to put President Morsy on notice that he really has to do what's necessary to prevent the escalation of these demonstrations in Cairo to what we have seen, for example, in Libya."" On Thursday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama used the correct ""diplomatic and legal terms"" in that the United States and Egypt do not have a formal alliance or mutual defense treaty. But, he said, Egypt remains ""a longstanding partner"" of the United States, and U.S. officials have no intention of cutting aid to the country. Yemeni police, demonstrators hurt in U.S. Embassy clashes . Brookings Institution analyst Shadi Hamid said it was telling that the United States seemed angrier about Morsy's delayed response than it was when the country's military government disbanded parliament this year. ""After getting on 'right side' of history, security still trumps democracy,"" Hamid posted on Twitter. ""That's fine (and not surprising) but let's not pretend otherwise,"" he said. But Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said the president's assessment was largely correct. ""They have gone from a staunch ally under Mubarak to one which is a country that's seeking its own way,"" McCain said. He said that the United States needs to have a good relationship with Egypt, but that it is understandable why many in the United States are displeased with its leaders. ""They have a pretty big army,"" McCain said. ""They could have protected our embassy."" Thursday's protests were a continuation of demonstrations that broke out Wednesday night near the embassy. Protesters tried to push through barbed wire fencing protecting the embassy and set fire to two police trucks and a car, according to Alla Mahmoud, a spokesman for the Egyptian Interior Ministry. Forces pushed back the protesters after the vehicles were set on fire. ""Forces were able to push them down toward Tahrir Square farther from the embassy street,"" Mahmoud said, adding that some arrests had been made. At least 13 protesters and six police officers were injured in the earlier clashes, Egyptian government officials said Thursday. Reaction to film fuels debate on free speech vs. hate speech .

"Rancho Palos Verdes, California (CNN) -- Google, now an Internet giant, is learning that it needs to take more careful steps in regards to privacy. Prompted by intensifying scrutiny from government regulators and privacy watchdogs, Google is striving to be more sensitive to data-collection issues that often make people uneasy. It went so far as to spike a recent project Google engineers had developed because of fears of potential backlash, said Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman and former CEO. The scrapped software would have let people include their head shot photos in a database so that they could be recognized by a mobile application when someone takes a picture of their faces. ""We built that technology, and we withheld it,"" Schmidt said in an onstage interview at the D: All Things Digital conference here on Tuesday. ""As far as I know, it was the only technology that Google built, and we decided to stop."" That product was meant to be part of an app called Google Goggles, which is able to look at a picture taken from a phone and then translate text or recognize a building, advertisement or painting. (Facial recognition is, however, being used to power a feature in Google Maps's Street View that blurs the faces of bystanders caught on camera.) As recently as March, Google still had plans to eventually release the facial-recognition version of the app, CNN reported. Schmidt was less supportive of the idea at a conference two weeks ago when he said it was ""unlikely"" that Google would release the software. With facial-recognition technology, ""an evil dictator could use that against you,"" Schmidt said on Tuesday. ""We're so sensitive on the privacy issue now."" Since Schmidt handed over the CEO reigns to co-founder Larry Page in April, the goal was to create an organization that operates more autonomously, that works like a startup, Google managers say. But to address privacy issues, Google has inserted a layer of oversight to reduce the recklessness that many fledgling companies get away with. ""Historically, we would just throw stuff over the wall,"" Schmidt said. ""We now have a very, very thorough process."" Company lawyers and government-policy specialists now work with the development teams as they're building products and brainstorming ideas, Schmidt said. It's their job to wrangle expectations and ensure Google doesn't overstep ""the creepy line"" (to borrow a phrase from Schmidt). Regulators say Google has crossed that line before, with its camera-taking vehicles and with Google Buzz. The latter attracted the ire of the U.S. government when the service published the e-mail contact lists for users. As a result, Google agreed to submit to reviews of its privacy policies as part of a Federal Trade Commission settlement. Schmidt, an industry veteran, knows that a series of stumbles can scar a tech company. He said at the conference that software giant Microsoft is no longer a top player among tech brands. ""Microsoft is not driving the consumer revolution in the mind of consumers,"" Schmidt said. (However, it's worth noting that in an interview with the Wall Street Journal last year, Schmidt named Microsoft, with its Bing search engine, as Google's biggest competitor, ahead of Apple and Facebook.) Schmidt's big four is Amazon.com, Apple, Facebook and (you guessed it) Google. Honorary mentions go to Twitter and PayPal. Coincidentally, the latter is suing Google over its new mobile-payments service, called Google Wallet, which launches in Portland on Wednesday and was demonstrated at the event. Apple, which Google competes with on smartphones and soon laptops, was a recipient of much praise from Schmidt. He said Apple makes ""beautiful products"" and has just renewed a deal to use Google's search and maps services. He suggested people buy Mac computers over Microsoft's Windows PCs if they're concerned about getting viruses -- ""speaking as a proud former board member of Apple,"" he said. Besides including Facebook in his list of top companies, Schmidt had little else to laud the social network for. The site is about connecting with ""every friend you've ever had, including the ones you can't quite remember,"" he said. Google has tried to partner with Facebook, but Microsoft usually wins those deals, he said. Facebook, too, has had to walk a privacy tightrope when rolling out new features. Responding to a question about Facebook's growing presence, Schmidt said: ""I think the industry would benefit from having an alternative.""","Google has appointed lawyers to work with developers on new products .
For the first time, Google canned a finished project due to privacy concerns .
The product would have used facial recognition to find out who someone is ."
"(CNN)  -- John Isner has defeated Nicolas Mahut 70 games to 68 in the final set of their first round marathon match at Wimbledon. After 11 hours and five minutes, spread over three days, the 6-foot-9 American finally broke his French opponent's serve in the 138th game of the fifth set, putting an end to one of the most extraordinary matches of tennis ever played. The final score read 6-4 3-6 6-7 7-6 70-68. Interviewed after the match, Isner had warm praise for Mahut. ""What can I say, The guy is an absolute warrior. To share this day with him was an absolute honor. I wish him nothing but the best. Maybe we'll meet again somewhere down the road and it won't be 70-68,"" Isner told the BBC. Mahut described the last three days as an amazing experience. ""The Crowd was fantastic, John deserved to win,"" he told the BBC. Immediately after the match ended, officials from the All England Club presented both players with momentos for their record-breaking feat. The players then posed for a photograph by the scoreboard, alongside match umpire Mohamed Lahyani. A huge crowd greeted the players as they returned to Court 18 a little after 2.30pm GMT, Thursday, with spectators and press lining the walkways above the court. Isner, serving first, took the opening game of the day, but Mahut followed up by holding his serve to level the match 60 games all. The match quickly resumed the pattern established on Wednesday with each player rarely looking in trouble on their own serve. The pair battled on for a further 20 games before Isner, who served a record breaking 115 aces during the match, triumphed. The pair had already made history on Wednesday contesting the longest grand slam singles match of all time. It was called off for the day due to bad light at 59 games all in the fifth and deciding set after 10 hours of action. During their marathon fifth set, the pair surpassed the previous record of six hours and 33 minutes set at the 2004 French Open, when Fabrice Santoro beat fellow Frenchman Arnaud Clement 6-4 6-3 6-7 3-6 16-14. Isner had match point at 59-58, but Mahut saved it with an ace and went on to level again. The match had also been stopped on Tuesday night due to bad light. ""This is beyond anything I've ever seen. It's absolutely amazing,"" Defending champion Roger Federer told reporters, Wednesday. ""I have almost no words anymore watching this. I don't know how their bodies must be feeling. This is incredible tennis. Someone has to lose, but in this match both will be winners,"" Federer added.","John Isner beats Nicolas Mahut 70 games to 68 in final set of first round Wimbledon match .

"(CNN) -- A pair of gaffes by Vice President Biden and ex-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton illustrate just how hard it is to explain how vast the gaps of income and wealth in America have become -- including the significant but seldom-discussed difference between being merely rich and being super-rich. When Biden recently told an audience -- inaccurately, it turned out -- ""I don't own a single stock or bond ... I have no savings accounts,"" he was widely seen as responding to earlier comments by Clinton that she and her multimillionaire husband, ex-President Bill Clinton, would not be seen by voters as part of the economic elite who crashed the economy because ""we pay ordinary income tax, unlike a lot of people who are truly well off."" Both statements were widely seen as hopelessly off-key and out of touch, especially coming from politicians whose not-so-secret hopes for a shot at running for president in 2016 depend on connecting with average Americans. If they expect to make it through the coming campaign without further ridicule, Biden and Clinton will have to figure out a better way to discuss -- or not discuss -- their personal finances. Let's start with a reality check. Biden and his wife do, indeed, own multiple savings and stock accounts, but most have less than $15,000 in them. That makes Biden relatively poor, compared with his former colleagues in the U.S. Senate, whose average wealth is nearly $1 million. But the vice president is much better off than the typical U.S. family, which has a savings account balance of only $3,800. More than half of all Americans own no stock at all, and only one-third have stock accounts worth more than $5,000. Clinton suffers a similar problem of perspective. It's true that she and her husband ended the Clinton presidency facing $5 million in legal bills and no place to live (they'd spent more than a decade living in the Arkansas governor's mansion and then the White House). But Hillary Clinton's $8 million advance for her autobiography instantly moved the family into the 1%, and both she and her husband can command $200,000 per speech. Bill Clinton's net worth is estimated at $55 million. Even with all that wealth, Clinton's underlying point -- that she and Bill earn their money and pay taxes on it every year -- is valid. The rarified company the former first couple keeps put them in touch with the super-rich -- heirs to great fortunes and owners of vast companies who don't need to write books or give speeches to rake in their millions. It's the difference between life in the top 1% -- which requires household earnings of about $394,000 a year -- and the top .01%, where the money zooms into the stratosphere and, more important, comes mostly from stocks and other investments rather than work. When merely rich people like Biden and Clinton look around within the 1%, they can't help but notice -- perhaps with a touch of envy -- that the top 0.1% crowd is living a very different lifestyle. It's one thing to fly first class (or even Air Force One) and quite another to pal around with people who command their own personal fleets of private jets. But if Biden and Clinton are serious about a 2016 foray into the vote-getting business, they must suppress the very real urge to present themselves as ""just plain folks"" in a country where they are, by any measure, among the most fortunate. According to Census Bureau figures, half of all U.S. households earn less than $53,000 a year. Those voters aren't likely to extend much sympathy to a vice president crying the blues about saving nothing while earning a federal salary of $233,000 a year or an ex-Cabinet member, ex-senator who commands $200,000 per speech. The surest cure for seeming out of touch is to hit the campaign trail, with its endless string of town hall meetings and county fairs, its trips to diners, bowling alleys and factories during shift changes. It will take Biden and Clinton back to their own working-class roots, and remind them what real economic struggle looks like.","Errol Louis: Biden, Hillary gaffes show how wide America's wealth gap has become .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- A military jury on Friday convicted Army Maj. Nidal Hasan of 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder in a shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas, making it possible for the death penalty to be considered as a punishment. The jurors deliberated less than seven hours over two days before finding Hasan guilty on all charges in connection with the November 5, 2009, shootings at a deployment process center. The Army psychiatrist admitted to targeting soldiers he was set to deploy with to Afghanistan, saying previously he wanted to protect the Taliban and its leaders from the U.S. military. Under the rules of a military court-martial, the jury must return a unanimous verdict of premeditated murder for the death penalty to be considered as a punishment option. The jury is not required to tell the court whether they reached a unanimous verdict on the attempted murder charges. The court-martial moves on Monday to the penalty phase, where Hasan -- acting as his own attorney -- will have the opportunity to address the jurors considering whether he should be executed for his actions. As has been done nearly every day in the three-week court-martial, the judge asked Hasan if he had reconsidered defending himself as the case enters the penalty phase. Jurors ""will decide whether you live or die,"" the judge, Col. Tara Osborn, told Hasan after reconvening the court Monday afternoon as part of the penalty phase preparation. ""...I think it is unwise for you to represent yourself."" Hasan told the judge he intended to continue acting as his own attorney. Courtroom reaction . Inside the courtroom, the judge warned the audience in the gallery, including family members of those killed, before the verdict was announced that outbursts and reactions to the verdict would not be tolerated. Hasan stroked his beard as the jury -- a military panel of 13 senior officers -- filed into the courtroom. He then looked at the head of the jury -- a colonel -- who affirmed a verdict had been reached. Hasan showed no emotion as the verdict was read, a contrast to a handful of some of family members who cried or gave one another brief hugs. ""Today's guilty verdict, rendered almost four years after the attack, is only a first, small step down the path of justice for the victims,"" said attorney Neal M. Sher, who represents victims and families of those killed in a compensation claim against the government for failing to stop the attack. Almost immediately after the attacks, there were widespread questions about how Hasan was evaluated, promoted and transferred to Fort Hood with plans to deploy to Afghanistan despite questions about his actions, including giving an academic presentation on the value of suicide bombings. Sher renewed the call for the government to reclassify the shootings as a ""terror attack"" rather than workplace violence. ""Justice for the victims of Fort Hood will be done only when the government admits its mistakes, keeps its promises to 'make the victims whole' and comes clean about Fort Hood, "" Sher said. "" The victims, and the American people, are owed nothing less."" The husband of Amber Bahr Gadlin, a former private who testified about the wounds she received during the attack, said the death penalty ""would be too lenient"" for Hasan. ""I would much rather see him sit in prison for the rest of his life. He shouldn't be allowed to dictate what happens. He wants to motivate other terrorists,"" Joshua Gadlin told CNN by telephone. Hasan doesn't call witnesses, give closing argument . On Thursday afternoon, the judge handed the case to the jury after Hasan declined to make a statement during closing arguments that followed 12 days of testimony. The prosecution urged the jury to convict, saying the evidence showed that he believed he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible. ""There is no doubt, as I said in the beginning, the accused is the shooter,"" the prosecutor, Col. Steven Henricks, told the jury. ""The only question for you is ... is this a premeditated design to kill?"" For more than 90 minutes, the prosecutor took the jury methodically through the evidence in the case, meticulously piecing together how he says Hasan prepared and planned for the attack. Soldier on soldier attacks Fast Facts . Prosecutors have maintained that the American-born Muslim underwent a progressive radicalization that led to the massacre at the sprawling central Texas base. ""He did not want to deploy, and he came to believe he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible,"" Henricks told the jury. Hasan picked the day -- November 5, 2009 -- because it was when the units he was scheduled to deploy with to Afghanistan were scheduled to go through the processing center, he said. Hasan rested his case without calling a single witness or taking the stand to testify on his own behalf. His decision not to offer a defense was an anticlimactic end to the trial in which prosecution witnesses, primarily survivors, painted a horrific picture of what unfolded inside a processing center during the attack. A graphic FBI video during closing arguments . During closing arguments, prosecutors showed a graphic FBI video of the crime scene hours after the rampage, where bodies, blood and bullets still covered the floor. As the video was shown to the jury, some of the family members of those killed fought back tears. One woman laid her head on her husband's shoulder, tears pouring down her cheeks, while another woman, a wife of a victim, left the courtroom. For his part, Hasan watched the video, appearing to pay close attention. Hasan, who has insisted that the jury not be allowed to consider lesser charges against him, said his attack on soldiers at Fort Hood was not an act of ""sudden passion."" Fort Hood victims feel betrayed . There was ""adequate provocation"" for the attack because the soldiers were going to participate in ""an illegal war"" in Afghanistan, Hasan told the military judge Wednesday, arguing against the jury being allowed to consider voluntary manslaughter or unpremeditated murder. Prosecutors argued against the inclusion of lesser charges, saying the attack wasn't carried out in ""the heat of sudden passion,"" and Hasan said he agreed. The judge ruled that the jurors can consider a lesser charge of unpremeditated murder but not voluntary manslaughter. They can also consider unpremeditated attempted and other lesser charges, she ruled. Hasan's defense . Much has been made of Hasan's defense or, as his stand-by attorneys have said, the lack of it. Judge Tara Osborn declined a request by Hasan's attorneys to drop out of the case. The attorneys argued that Hasan was helping the prosecution put him to death. There may be something to that claim. Hasan took credit for the shooting rampage at the outset of the trial, telling the jury during opening statements that the evidence will show ""I was the shooter."" Osborn barred Hasan from pleading guilty at the start of the court-martial. Under military law, defendants cannot enter guilty pleas in capital punishment cases. The judge has refused to allow Hasan to argue ""defense of others,"" a claim that he carried out the shootings to protect the Afghan Taliban and its leaders from U.S. soldiers. Perhaps as a way around that ruling, Hasan in recent days has leaked documents through his civilian attorney to The New York Times and Fox News that offer a glimpse of his justification for carrying out the attack. Among the documents was a mental health evaluation conducted by a military panel to determine whether Hasan was fit to stand trial. ""I don't think what I did was wrong because it was for the greater cause of helping my Muslim brothers,"" he told the panel, according to pages of the report published by The New York Times. He also said, according to the documents: ""I'm paraplegic and could be in jail for the rest of my life. However, if I died by lethal injection, I would still be a martyr."" Prosecutors call dozens of witnesses . Military prosecutors called 89 witnesses and submitted more than 700 pieces of evidence before resting their case. The judge excluded much of the evidence that the prosecution contends goes to the heart of the motive for the attack, including e-mail communications between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki, the U.S.-born cleric who officials say became a key member of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. He was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2011. Osborn also declined to allow prosecutors to use materials they maintain showed Hasan's interest in the actions of Army Sgt. Hasan Akbar, the American soldier sentenced to death for killing two soldiers and wounding more than a dozen others at the start of the Iraq war, an attack he said he carried out to stop soldiers from killing Muslims. Along with the e-mails and the material related to Akbar, Osborn declined to allow the use of Hasan's academic presentation on suicide bombings, saying ""motive is not an element of the crime.""","NEW: Husband of a victim says death penalty ""would be too lenient"" for Hasan .

"(CNN) -- Teriyaki meatballs, rice, cookies and a bottle of water. That's what authorities gave a hungry teen stowaway who survived a five-hour flight hidden in the wheel well of a jetliner, soon after his unexpected arrival. The 15-year-old boy sneaked into the wheel well of a Boeing 767 and flew from San Jose, California, to Maui, Hawaii. ""He was really soft-spoken and appeared to be tired. His answers were a little slow initially coming out,"" Maui District Airport Manager Marvin Moniz told CNN affiliate KGO. ""We did get him some food prior to the paramedics getting here. We asked if he was hungry. He indicated yes he was. We got him some teriyaki meatballs and rice and a package of cookies and a bottle of water,"" Moniz said. According to a state health official, the teen is recovering at a Hawaii hospital. Once he's ready to go home to California, he'll have access to counselors and psychologists, Santa Clara High School Principal Gregory Shelby told KGO. The quiet teen, who recently transferred to Santa Clara High, is now the talk of the school. Emanuael Golla, a senior, said the boy was extremely shy. He told CNN that he had just arrived within the past few weeks. But he already wanted to run away from home -- apparently to see his mother in Somalia. His father and stepmother live in Santa Clara, where neighbors say family members kept to themselves after moving in a few months ago. ""When I watched the analysis about the extraordinary and dangerous trip of my son on local TVs and that Allah had saved him, I thanked God and I was very happy,"" the teen's father told Voice of America's Somali service on Wednesday. He described his son as a ""really cool boy,"" a ""very quiet person, always busy with watching the TV and using computer."" When asked what might have motivated the teen's trip, the father told VOA his son had been struggling in school. ""He did not receive education when he was in Africa. Since we came here, he had learning challenges at school. He was not good at math and science, and I think he had a lot of education problems bothering him,"" the father said. ""He was always talking about going back to Africa, where his grandparents still live,"" he told VOA. ""We want to go back, but due to the current living conditions, we can't go back."" The boy is said to have hopped a fence at San Jose International Airport shortly after 1 a.m. on Sunday, the dark of night cloaking his intentions. But the teen, who has not been publicly named, didn't just breach the fence -- he stayed on the grounds for six hours without getting caught, a government official said. The boy just wanted to see his mother in Somalia, a law enforcement official said. But he had no clue which plane went where. Eventually, he settled on a Hawaiian Airlines 767. Armed with nothing but a comb, he climbed into the jet's wheel well. As the plane took off, the wheels came up -- barely sparing the teen from a crushing impact. It was just the first of several dangers that nearly took his life. The temperature dropped well below zero. The oxygen levels diminished. By the time the plane ascended higher than the peak of Mount Everest, he had passed out. It wasn't until an hour after the plane landed in Maui that he emerged from the underside of the jet. The idea that he survived the flight seemed unbelievable. The boy is now in the custody of Hawaii child welfare services workers, said Kayla Rosenfeld, spokeswoman for the state's Department of Human Services. It's quite possible he suffered permanent brain damage such as neurological issues, memory problems or a lower IQ, said Dr. Kenneth Stahl, a trauma surgeon at Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital. The teen also could have frostbite or a kidney injury because when the body freezes, particles of muscle enter the bloodstream and damage the kidneys, the doctor said.

"(CNN) -- They struggled to get pregnant for nearly two years. They gave it a go the natural way and then did three or four intrauterine inseminations, where the sperm is washed, concentrated and placed directly into a woman's uterus at an optimal time. But as mom and dad were both ""pushing 40,"" these methods didn't work, and the couple decided to try in vitro fertilization. With in vitro, or IVF, several eggs are fertilized outside the body; the resulting embryos are then implanted in the woman's womb. It worked -- on the first try. But the result wasn't exactly what this couple was looking for. ""To say we're excited would be an exaggeration,"" the dad wrote on Babble.com in an anonymous post that recently started trending on social media. ""More truthfully, we're pissed. And terrified, and angry, and guilty, and regretful."" You see, both embryos that were implanted stuck. The wife is pregnant with twins. ""I lay on the table -- dazed and unhappy -- as I received the news that there were two healthy sacs present,"" the anonymous mom wrote in a separate post. ""We were pregnant with twins -- twin boys, we'd find out later. In my mind I had done nothing less than ruin our family."" To say the reaction from Babble's readers was angry would be an understatement. Many blasted the couple for being ungrateful. Selfish. Bitter. ""Seriously, suck. it. up,"" one commenter wrote. But there was a small majority who seemed to sympathize with how these new parents were feeling: overwhelmed, exhausted and afraid they won't be able to provide for these new lives in addition to their older son. Multiple births are an increasingly common outcome for couples using assisted reproductive technology, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and IVF is often responsible. ""A woman undergoing IVF has an approximate 22-fold increased risk of conceiving a twin pregnancy and a 100-fold increased risk of conceiving a triplet pregnancy, as compared with natural conception,"" ACOG's website says. So why do doctors still occasionally place multiple embryos in women who undergo IVF? Because the chances that even one will stick and grow into a baby are low. According to the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies, women under the age of 35 have a less than 43% chance of giving birth after IVF; women over 41 have a less than 18% chance. Dr. Dorothy Mitchell-Leef, a fertility specialist in Atlanta, always has a long conversation with her patients before implanting any embryos. She said she discusses the risks, the possibility of multiples and the chances that the couple may not get pregnant. ""They may be angry because maybe that's not what they wanted,"" Mitchell-Leef said of the anonymous couple on Babble.com. ""But they have to ask themselves: Did you have a conversation that stressed the fact that you did not want more than one pregnancy?"" The problem, she said, is that no doctor can promise which embryos are going to take, if any at all. IVF specialists have become more cautious. As doctors saw the multiple birth rates increase dramatically in the United States, they began transferring fewer embryos to the mother. Most of the time, Mitchell-Leef said, she only implants one. But the quality of the embryos matters; so does the woman's age. A 41-year-old with three embryos has a low chance of any one of those being normal, ""but the better chance is to put three in hoping that one will take,"" Mitchell-Leef said. You may remember how Nadya Suleman -- aka ""Octomom"" -- was criticized for not reducing the number of embryos she carried before giving birth to octuplets. Selective reduction -- which involves aborting one, or more than one, of the fetuses -- was also a possibility for this anonymous Babble couple. In general, the decision to do a reduction for twins is extremely controversial. Twins don't necessarily carry high health risks to the mother or her children beyond perhaps needing bed rest and more intense care, Mitchell-Leef said. ""We considered a reduction for about 30 seconds,"" this anonymous father wrote. ""If you thought that IVF involved playing god, a reduction felt beyond brazen -- Machiavellian, even."" Selective reduction is usually done between 9 and 12 weeks into the pregnancy. A doctor will use a needle to inject potassium chloride into the fetus, according to the National Institutes of Health. There is a small risk the mother will miscarry all the fetuses with this procedure. Multiple gestation is risky for both mom and the babies, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Multiples are more likely to have developmental problems. Moms carrying multiples are more likely to miscarry, develop gestational diabetes and to suffer from high blood pressure-related issues such as pre-eclampsia. Fertility treatments: Would you get selective reduction? But multiples can also be a blessing. ""You will make it work and you will love these children,"" posted one commenter, who says she's the mother of twins. ""I won't lie and say that it is going to be a breeze, because it won't. But I promise you if you pull through the first year together as a team you will be the strongest kind of family there can be, and nothing can stop you from there!""","Couple writes anonymously about their frustration in being pregnant with twins after IVF .

"(CNN) -- The death of MI6 codebreaker Gareth Williams -- whose naked body was found inside an externally locked bag in his bathtub in 2010 -- was a ""perfect crime,"" a confined spaces expert says. Peter Faulding said he disagreed with Scotland Yard's conclusion that Williams most likely locked himself in the bag, saying it was his belief that the MI6 worker was murdered. Last week, London's Metropolitan Police said its three-year investigation had found a lack of evidence to show that someone else had been involved in Williams' death. The police position differs from a 2012 coroner's report, which said it was likely he had been killed. Read more: MI6 codebreaker not killed, police say . Faulding testified at the Coroner's inquest and did not definitively rule out that Williams could have somehow locked himself into the bag alone. But he said he could not have done so without leaving evidence. This week Faulding told CNN he was still of that view, using the same model of bag and a similar type of bathtub to show how Williams could have gotten into the bag and why he held the view that someone else was involved. ""There was no DNA found on the padlock, the zipper closures -- anywhere around this bath,"" he said. ""To do this without leaving a trace is absolutely impossible. Even Houdini couldn't do this."" Faulding said the lack of DNA was ""the key to this crime."" ""We can zip ourselves in the bag ... but you can't do it without leaving a trace."" Faulding said a scuff mark was found on the bath, and it was his belief that Williams was murdered. ""The bag was lifted. It scuffed the top and he was dropped into the bath,"" he said. With the heating in Williams' apartment turned up, Faulding said ""the decomposition fluids would actually run down the plughole, and it would stop the smell of decomposition escaping the flat."" He concluded: ""This was the perfect crime."" Read more: Coroner says spy likely poisoned, suffocated . The Met last week acknowledged that some of the evidence -- including the lack of DNA on the padlock or hand prints on the bath -- was ""odd."" It said there was insufficient evidence to be definitive on how Williams died but that police believed that theirs was the ""more probable"" conclusion. The case gripped the British public when Williams was found dead at age 31 in August 2010. Among the theories aired by UK media were that Williams might have died at the hands of foreign intelligence agents or as a result of a kinky sexual encounter gone wrong. While the circumstances of Williams' death remain somewhat murky, there is still forensic evidence left to examine. More than 10 samples of DNA found in Williams' apartment were too small to test. Police say that maybe, one day, technology may help solve the mystery. Read more: Mysterious spy death grips Britain .","MI6 codebreaker Gareth Williams' body was found locked in a bag in 2010 .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- A doctor's license was revoked Friday in the case of a teenager who planned to have an abortion but instead gave birth to a baby she says was killed when clinic staffers put it into a plastic bag and threw it in the trash. Pierre Jean-Jacques Renelique, right, and his attorney, Joseph Harrison, at the hearing. The doctor, Pierre Jean-Jacques Renelique, was not present when the baby was born, but the Florida Medical Board upheld Department of Health allegations that he falsified medical records, inappropriately delegated tasks to unlicensed personnel and committed malpractice. Joseph Harrison, the attorney representing Renelique at the license revocation hearing in Tampa, said Renelique has not decided whether to appeal. The state attorney's office, meanwhile, said its criminal investigation into the incident is ongoing and no charges have been filed. A fetus born alive cannot be put to death even if its mother intended to have an abortion, police said when the incident occurred in 2006. The baby's mother, Sycloria Williams, sued Renelique, the clinic and its staff in January, seeking damages. She alleges in her suit that ""she witnessed the murder of her daughter"" and said she ""sustained severe emotional distress, shock and psychic trauma which have resulted in discernible bodily injury."" ""This is not about a pot of gold,"" said Tom Pennekamp, her attorney. ""What this is about is right and wrong and making a statement, making sure it doesn't happen to other young women."" According to the suit, Williams, then 18, discovered while being treated for a fall that she was 23 weeks pregnant. She went to a clinic to get an abortion on the morning of July 20, 2006, after receiving medication and instructions the previous day. Renelique was not at the clinic, however, and Williams was told to wait for him. She was given two pills and told they would make her ill. When she complained of feeling ill, clinic staff members gave her a robe and told her to lie down in a patient room, the suit says. Renelique was still not present when Williams ""felt a large pain"" and delivered a baby girl, according to the suit. ""The staff began screaming and pandemonium ensued. Sycloria watched in horror and shock as her baby writhed with her chest rising and falling as she breathed."" A clinic co-owner entered the room and used a pair of shears to cut the baby's umbilical cord, the suit said. She ""then scooped up the baby and placed the live baby, placenta and afterbirth in a red plastic biohazard bag, which she sealed, and then threw bag and the baby in a trash can."" Staff at the clinic did not call 911 or seek medical assistance for Williams or the baby, the suit said. Renelique arrived at the clinic about an hour later and gave Williams a shot to put her to sleep. ""She awoke after the procedure and was sent home still in complete shock,"" the suit said. Police were notified of the incident by an anonymous caller who told them the baby was born alive and disposed of. ""The complainant [Williams] observed the baby moving and gasping for air for approximately five minutes,"" according to a police affidavit requesting a search warrant for the clinic. Two search warrants found nothing, but officers executing a third warrant ""found the decomposing body of a baby in a cardboard box in a closet,"" the suit said. The baby was linked to Williams through DNA testing, the lawsuit said. An autopsy showed it had filled its lungs with air prior to death. Documents from the state Department of Health said its cause of death was determined to be ""extreme prematurity."" Fewer than 1 percent of babies are born at less than 28 weeks, according to the March of Dimes, a nonprofit organization aimed at reducing premature births, birth defects and infant mortality. Infants born at that stage may survive, but require treatment with oxygen, other medical help and mechanical assistance to help them breathe. They are too immature to suck or swallow and so must be fed intravenously. Babies born before about 32 weeks of gestation face the highest risk of health problems, the March of Dimes said. Williams' lawsuit seeks damages from Renelique, the clinic and its staff. It claims that clinic records were falsified to say only that Williams underwent an abortion. Williams filed the suit individually and ""as personal representative of the estate of Shanice Denise Osbourne, deceased,"" the suit said. The medical board's action Friday came at the request of the Florida Department of Health, which filed an order in February 2007 seeking emergency restrictions on Renelique's license. Department documents list many of the same allegations as Williams' lawsuit. ""Dr. Renelique's failure to practice medicine with that level of care, skill and treatment that is recognized as being acceptable, as well as his willingness to falsify medical records, poses a serious and immediate danger to the public,"" the health department said. Renelique did not respond to the health department or dispute the facts it alleged, department spokeswoman Eulinda Jackson said Friday. Williams has declined to speak publicly about the case, said Pennekamp, her attorney. She suffers from post-traumatic stress because of the experience, he said.","Teen says she sought abortion, but gave birth and baby was killed .

"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- A cruise ship carrying 122 people was stranded Thursday on the coast of Antarctica after striking ice, officials said. Mariano Memolli of the Argentina Antarctic Directorate told Argentina's TodoNoticias (TN) Television a naval boat and plane were dispatched to evacuate the passengers of the Ushuaia as a precaution. The ship, carrying 89 passengers and 33 crew members, was losing fuel and taking on water but was not in danger of sinking, Television C5N reported. Adm. Daniel Martin, head of the naval base in Ushuaia, Argentina, where a call for help was received from the ship, said the passengers were ""in a perfect state of health,"" and were awaiting the arrival of the Atlantic Dream, a nearby cruise ship, C5N said. ""The weather conditions are not the best"" where the ship is, he said. ""There are regular winds in the zone with violent gusts."" But he said the ship is protected because it is in a strait, and the weather would not affect the arrival of the rescue plane. The Panamanian-flagged Ushuaia was located about 186 miles (300 kilometers) southwest of Argentina's Marambio naval base in Antarctica.

"(CNN) -- The two men vying to lead Indonesia is a study in contrasts: a self-made furniture salesman who has sprang into contention for the country's top political job, and a former general with a long military history who projects a strongman image. In the fourth election for the young Indonesian democracy, Joko Widodo and Prabowo Subianto are in contention to lead a country with a slowed economy and rising voter concerns about corruption in government. One of them will become the head of the most populous Muslim nation for the next five years when voters make their choice on July 9. Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo . Commonly known by his nickname ""Jokowi,"" Widodo, 53, has been compared to the 2008 vintage of Barack Obama in part for his charisma and focus on change, and also because he represents a break from the political establishment. Styling himself as a man of the people, Widodo eschews business suits for checkered shirts with his sleeves rolled up. As a self-made businessman turned Jakarta governor, Widodo would be the first president without a connection to the military or the country's traditional elite. ""In order to resolve problems in Indonesia related to rule of law and fighting corruption, it can only be done by a new figure, not by someone who's been taken hostage by the past,"" Widodo told CNN. Much like Obama's sprightly first campaign, Widodo relies heavily on his personal history and his image as an outsider. That appeal helped Widodo charge ahead in opinion polls earlier this year, when he appeared to be a virtual lock for the presidency. But much of his lead has eroded following smear campaigns suggesting that he is of Chinese descent or even a Christian -- a deal breaker for many in this Muslim-majority nation. The attacks have sidetracked his campaign and prompted Widodo to release evidence of his upbringing and photos of his haj pilgrimages to Mecca. The smear campaigns have ""forced Jokowi on the defensive on issues of his personal identity,"" instead of being able to put up a progressive vision for the country, said Douglas Ramage, an analyst with Bower Group Asia, based in Jakarta. Born in the central Java city of Surakarta, Widodo grew up in a slum on the banks of the Anyar River. His family lived in illegally-built shacks, in which they were evicted by the government. This background has helped his appeal among the country's poor. ""Jokowi is very popular among farmers and the common people,"" said Hamdi Muluk, a professor at Indonesia University who specializes in political psychology. ""His image is that he is part of the people."" Widodo worked in his family's furniture business before starting his own export company, which he made a huge success. In 2005, he was elected mayor of Surakarta and became known for his spontaneous visits to slums, which drew media attention, and unannounced drop-ins at government offices to catch under-performing workers. He rose to become Jakarta governor in 2012, where he piloted new healthcare and education programs. But critics say Widodo is too inexperienced and hasn't finished his work in Jakarta after only 18 months in the governor's office. Several major projects, including a new railway, remain behind schedule. Widodo's policy platform tends to be grounded by his own experience as a businessman. He speaks on the campaign trail about the difficulty of licensing and regulations, and the need to simplify the bureaucracy to help businesses succeed. Widodo says to help Indonesia's economy, the government has to tackle corruption. ""We will issue a decree related to strengthening a bureaucracy that is clean and always there to serve,"" he said. ""This way, we can attract more investment to Indonesia and consequently create more jobs."" Prabowo Subianto . Prabowo Subianto has framed himself as the strong, decisive leader, calling for more nationalistic policies. In a nod to both his military background and his Muslim faith, Prabowo styles himself in a khaki military-style shirt and fez, much like his former father-in-law, Suharto, the country's second president. A hulking presence, Prabowo even arrived to campaign events mounted on a Lusitano horse -- a famed breed used in dressage. ""He's the most experienced presidential candidate in Southeast Asia,"" said Ramage. ""He's been doing this for at least a decade."" Prabowo ran for president in 2004 and for vice-president in 2009. He has never held public office. As leader of the Great Indonesia Movement (Gerindra) party, he has touted his military service and projected the image of a decisive man capable of taking charge. Most voters ""have aspirations for a strong leader who will turn Indonesia to have a stronger position in Asia,"" said Wijayanto Samirin, managing director of Paramadina Public Policy Institute, a Jakarta think tank. Very much part of the country's traditional establishment, Prabowo, 62, is the son of the nation's leading economist. He also became part of one of the most influential families when he married Suharto's daughter, Siti Hediyati Hari in 1983. They have since divorced, but his ex-wife backs his candidacy, even appearing publicly in his campaign events. Suharto, who passed away in 2008, led a dictatorship in Indonesia for 32 years, which was marred by allegations of corruption, repression and the politically-motivated killings of an estimated 500,000 to a million opponents and dissidents. His downfall in 1998 ushered in an era of democracy in Indonesia. Prabowo's military service during the time of Suharto's reign has cast doubts over his human rights record, having served in controversial campaigns in West Papua and East Timor, which have both had independence movements, with East Timor achieving nationhood in 2002. Prabowo, however, has played up his military record -- he became a lieutenant general in the army -- which has proven to be both a blessing and a curse for his campaign. He is accused of several human rights violations, including the kidnapping of activists during the 1998 mass protests that led to Suharto's downfall. Prabowo has denied allegations, while human rights activists say he has not been held to account for his alleged actions. Prabowo was removed from his military post in 1998. Prabowo's former military boss, Wiranto who supports Jokowi in the presidential race, said in a televised press conference that Prabowo had been discharged for ordering the abduction of pro-democracy activists. In 2000, Prabowo was denied a visa to the United States, believed to stem from his human rights record. A U.S. State Department spokesman said it's not taking a position on Indonesia's presidential candidates but added that ""we do, however, take seriously allegations of human rights abuses, and urge the Indonesian government to fully investigate the claims."" The spokesman declined to comment about whether Prabowo's visa denial would be reversed if he were to be elected. When asked about the U.S. visa issue by Al Jazeera, he replied, ""Nelson Mandela was blacklisted from the United States at one time. Am I not in good company?"" Prabowo's representatives did not get back to CNN regarding an interview request by the time of publication. Regarding the allegations, Prabowo has maintained that he was following orders. ""I am the staunchest human rights defender in this country,"" he said during a televised debate in early June. CNN's Kathy Quiano contributed to this report from Jakarta.","Indonesia's voters to choose between military man or self-made furniture salesman .

"(CNN) -- Rachel Hope was 33 years old when she received a painful reminder: She couldn't outrun the past. Hope was trying to help a new assistant at her Maui rental property business, but it wasn't going smoothly. Part of it was Hope herself. ""I had this startle reflex,"" she explained. ""The phone would ring, and I'm literally three feet off the floor, screaming. ""My new assistant said, 'You're driving me crazy!' And I would say, 'I'm really sorry, just please try to ignore it. It's embarrassing, but let's keep working.' "" But the young man, a teacher on break, wasn't pushed off easily. Soon after, Hope said, ""he walked over to my desk and dropped a stack of papers two inches thick. It was every single PTSD study that was online, and he just said, 'pick one.' "" A few days later, Hope was dialing the number of South Carolina psychiatrist Dr. Michael Mithoefer. Her plan: to see whether she could free herself of a lifetime of torment by taking a drug he was testing -- a drug most people know as Ecstasy. A teetotaler, Hope wasn't looking for a thrill. She'd been born to a young hippie mother who couldn't stand the thought of parking their VW bus in one spot. After seeing psychedelic casualties all along the road, to Hope, drugs signified a lack of control. That was the last thing she needed. It was hard enough to hold things together stone sober. Truth be told, Hope didn't need her new assistant to tell her what the problem was. She just didn't know how to fix it. She'd been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, traced to a period of sexual abuse as a child and a life-threatening car accident. She'd been hospitalized four times for the debilitating symptoms, and stress had caused bleeding ulcers bad enough to send her to the emergency room twice more. Along the way, she tried cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnosis and acupuncture. She tried an established therapy called eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, where a therapist used physical stimuli -- light tapping and guided eye movements -- to try to retrain her brain. It made her eyeballs feel like they would burst out of her head. She tried gestalt therapy, screaming out her rage. ""Nothing worked,"" she says. ""I got to the point where I just said, 'I'm handicapped. I'm just going to have to live my life like this.' It was pretty horrible."" A formal plan . More than 7 million Americans suffer from PTSD, and by most estimates, only half of them -- at best -- are ever cured. A decade ago, the widely acknowledged need for better treatments opened the door to Mithoefer and his unconventional approach. By the time he took Hope's call in February 2005, the soft-spoken, ponytailed Mithoefer had managed to convince the Drug Enforcement Administration to green-light a study of Ecstasy as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Of course, he wasn't calling it Ecstasy. Neither were the scientists from the Food and Drug Administration and certainly not the DEA agents who had picked over Mithoefer's bungalow in Charleston, South Carolina, making sure it was ""secure"" in case drug-hunting criminals tried to break in and grab the stash. He'd gotten the 3,4-methylenedioxy-methylamphetamine (MDMA) -- the chemical name for pure Ecstasy -- from Rick Doblin, the founder of a MAPS, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. The group's stated purpose is to develop ""medical, legal and cultural contexts for people to benefit from the careful uses of psychedelics and marijuana."" It wants to turn mind-altering drugs like Ecstasy into prescription medicine. The advocacy unsettles some people, but this was no Timothy Leary operation. Doblin says he was determined to do things the right way. ""Doing science that gets reported, that's an idea we can sort of leverage,"" Doblin said. To win broader acceptance for MDMA -- and for cousins like LSD and psilocybin, the mind-altering compound in so-called magic mushrooms -- ""the medical route was the only route. Everything else was blocked."" That meant a formal plan for drug development: study protocols, institutional review boards and the rest. Mithoefer, a University of Virginia-trained clinician who specializes in trauma and had a long-running interest in MDMA, was the perfect partner. When Mithoefer enrolled the first patient in the new study in 2004, U.S. troops were in Iraq fighting the longest-running war in American history. They just didn't know it yet. Even then, there were men and women jumping out of their shoes at the sound of a car horn and waking up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat from another nightmare. But most troops hadn't come home yet. America wasn't ready. A sense of crisis was years away, but Mithoefer -- and other specialists in psychological trauma -- were bracing for a wave of tortured souls. Before taking Hope's call, the doctor had spent nearly three years navigating the federal bureaucracy to win approval for his small experiment, designed to test a simple question: Is MDMA, used in a clinical setting, safe? The point is sometimes lost, but even today, civilians make up the vast majority of people struggling with PTSD. As Mithoefer launched his research, he wouldn't be working with veterans. He'd be working with civilians, mostly female survivors of sexual assault. All had tried conventional treatments -- either therapy or medication -- without success. On average, they had suffered their debilitating symptoms for 19 years. Hope was patient No. 7. 'It just wouldn't stop' Hope was used to putting on a front. To a casual visitor, she seemed fine. Her rental property business in Hawaii earned a steady living, and she and a close friend were happily raising a 13-year-old son through an unconventional co-parenting arrangement. She was restless on Maui, but after a bumpy childhood, it seemed she'd found a kind of peace. But you didn't have to look hard to see a dark side. ""I was argumentative and defensive, and I was very angry,"" she recalled. ""I was having panic attacks and anxiety attacks and all the physical problems that come with it. I had irritable bowel syndrome, and I couldn't sleep."" To survive, she pushed people away. ""It makes intimate relationships very difficult,"" she said. ""Some part of me was on guard, and it just wouldn't stop."" To be continued in Sunday's story .","Rachel Hope suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder for years .

"Editor's Note: CNNU is following two student teams from the University of Southern California as they work to improve the quality of life in India. One team, Oral Cancer Awareness, is working to educate locals on the dangers of gutka. Tajdip Sandhu, a biological sciences major from USC, is part of that team. The following is a column he wrote for CNNU about his experience. The views expressed in this article are not necessarily those of CNN or its affiliates. Trash fills a local stream in Hubli, India. (CNN) -- Walking through the streets of Hubli, there are a few sights and sounds that one will notice immediately upon entering the city limits: auto-rickshaw horns, bright red dirt and trash. Trash is everywhere in Hubli, on the sides of the roads, in bushes around schools and temples and in the villages surrounding the city. The most prolific offender of the litter ravaging the city is the infamous gutka wrapper. Not only does this small little tobacco pouch pack a potent carcinogenic punch, but also it soils the background of the beautiful Indian environment. In a country that can boast of the majestic scenery of the Himalayas, the beaches of Goa and a man-made wonder of the world in the Taj Mahal, seeing this trash is disappointing. With a powerful force of motivated, educated and patriotic citizens, I am mystified by the paradox of the lack of determination illustrated through the social acceptance of littering. Personally, I feel that to dirty one's country implies that one lacks true pride in the land in which they were born and raised. I have a moral aversion to throwing trash aside at home in the US, because I am invested in the prosperity of my country.  Meet the rest of the students from the Oral Cancer Awareness Team » . While in Karnataka, I have had a chance to talk to the Hubli director of the Children's Movement for Civic Awareness. She informed me that her NGO is actually trying to instill such a sense of national responsibility in its young citizens ranging from water usage and litter to volunteer work. It seems as if the major impetus for ignoring the calls for civic awareness is the age-old mantra, ""everyone is doing it."" When one sees trash thrown on the road around them, with everyone including parents and grandparents performing in concert, one will follow in those footsteps as if it were innocuous. With a population well over one billion, refuting this thought process is difficult at best. The key to address this problem is to target the youth, as the CMCA is doing, in order to break the cycle comfort with trashing India. No society is perfect, but if even a fraction of the youth here could be motivated to buy into the principle that each individual in society can make an impact and has a responsibility to act for the greater good of everyone around them, India would be on the road to an even brighter future. The economy in India, booming with numerous highly-educated workers, can drive the country to certain levels of prosperity, but only the people can launch their homeland into an era of lasting social reform.","Students from University of Southern California go to India to improve quality of life .

"(CNN) -- Islamic fighters have seized control of a strategic Somali port city just outside the capital, Mogadishu, where United Nations relief supplies enter the famine-stricken country. Islamist fighters from Al-Shabaab group in Somalia display their flag. Al-Shabaab fighters chanted ""Allahu Akbar"" -- or ""God is great"" -- on Wednesday as the armed men entered Merka, located about 90 km (55 miles) south of Mogadishu, a local resident said. Earlier this year, the United States designated Al-Shabaab a terrorist group and has accused it of having ties to al Qaeda. On Tuesday, Al-Shabaab took control of two towns near Merka -- Bulo Marer and Quryoley -- giving it a strategic base in central Somalia, where it also controls Kismayo, the country's third-largest city. The fall of Merka marks the most important territorial gain by Al-Shabaab since it took control of Kismayo earlier this year. Al-Shabaab is consolidating its control in Somalia less than a week after a cease-fire was declared between other Islamic militias operating in Somalia and the country's transitional government. Under the pact -- which took effect last Thursday -- Ethiopian forces who support the transitional government would begin to withdraw from key positions on November 21 and leave Somalia completely within another 120 days, ending a two-year presence in its strife-torn, Horn of Africa neighbor. Al-Shabaab has rejected the cease-fire and was not a signatory to the deal, which was signed in Djibouti in late October and brokered by the United Nations and the African Union. Residents of Merka said hundreds of heavily armed Al-Shabaab fighters stormed the city without a fight, as rival militias who controlled the town had left Merka hours earlier. ""They are now in everywhere in the town including the police station and the prison,"" said Ali Sharif Hassan, a local businessman in Merka. ""Residents are coming out into the streets in large numbers to see them."" Many of the Islamic fighters rolled into Merka in ""technicals"" -- pick-up trucks mounted with anti-aircraft weapons that may have scared off the rival militias. So far, Al-Shabaab's seizure of Merka has not affected the U.N. World Food Programme's aid shipments to the port city, WFP spokesman Peter Smerdon told CNN. ""The situation in Merka appears to be calm,"" Smerdon said from his office in Nairobi, Kenya. The WFP currently has 25 Somali staffers in its Merka office, he said. Its eight international staff members were relocated a few weeks ago following the murder of a fellow staff member, he said. ""All we can say is WFP is a neutral organization -- we work with the authorities who are in place to deliver life-saving humanitarian aid,"" Smerdon said. ""Merka is a very strategic location for us, a natural beach port .. that we plan to continue using."" Ninety percent of WFP's food for Somalia arrives by sea, either through Mogadishu or Merka. The shipments are currently being escorted by NATO naval vessels to protect them from pirate attacks off Somalia's coast. Smerdon said most of the aid is delivered through Mogadishu because ""Merka can only take smaller ships, which have to unload on barges that take them on shore."" But Merka is a key port city because it allows WFP to reach more of southern Somalia. The conflict in the country makes it one of the most dangerous places in the world -- particularly for international aid workers -- and is making the humanitarian situation worse. More than 3 million people are estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance there -- a 77 percent increase since the start of 2008 -- according to a U.N. funded analysis released in August. One in six children under the age of 5 years is now acutely malnourished, and the numbers are rising, the analysis found.","Islamists seize control of Somali port city where U.N. supplies enter capital .

"(CNN) -- Golf legend Gary Player has told CNN that 20-year-old Rory McIlroy ""has the world at his feet"" after the Northern Ireland ace claimed his seventh top-10 finish from eight stroke play events with a third-place finish in Abu Dhabi. ""I believe he is the best young player in the world today. Everything is just going right for him and if he works hard he has got the world at his feet,"" Player told CNN's Living Golf in an exclusive sit-down interview with McIlroy. World number 11 McIlroy finished third at the U.S. PGA Championship in Augusta in 2009 but has only one career title to his name -- the Dubai Desert Classic -- despite a number of second-place finishes. McIlroy then raised eyebrows, after achieving his breakthrough win in the 2009 European Tour, by then committing to play on the rival U.S. Tour for 2010. However, Player -- who was in Abu Dhabi to open a new course of his own design -- said McIlroy's versatility would stand him in good stead for the future and ultimately lead to success in America. ""The good thing about Rory going to the United States is that he's learnt his golf in Europe, in Ireland where the wind blows and you have to play in rain.  A lot of young players haven't had that experience,"" he said. South African-born Player, 74, started his stint in the U.S. in the late 1950's competing for titles against the likes of Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. Despite often receiving verbal and physical abuse as a reaction to South Africa's apartheid policy, the one dubbed the ""Black Knight"" went on to complete a career grand slam by the age of 29. McIlroy will also face challenges to win titles, but Player was confident that with the help of father--figure and manager Chubby Chandler, McIlroy would also prove competitive. Despite the prospect of relocating McIlroy said he already feels at home on the other side of the Atlantic: ""I love it over in the States, it's one of the main reasons I wanted to take my card up over there. I love the courses, I love the climate and the people; I feel really comfortable over there.""","Gary Player tells CNN that 20-year-old Rory McIlroy ""has the world at his feet""

"MAE SOT, Thailand (CNN) -- A Myanmar rebel leader killed in February said that his group is fighting for the preservation of the ethnic Karen minority, and for greater freedom throughout the southeast Asian nation. Mahn Sha is seen at his home in Thailand shortly before his slaying in February. Pa Doh Mahn Sha, the secretary-general of the Karen National Union (KNU), spoke in an interview three weeks before his death. He talked about his group's battle against Myanmar's military government. ""Our struggle is to protect ourselves from the military regime,"" he said. ""They always attack our villages, burn down our villages, burn our food supplies. We want to stop fighting but we have no choice."" The government of Myanmar has blamed the KNU for waging attacks to destabilize the military junta. Mahn Sha was shot and killed at his home in Thailand on February 14, a KNU official said. During one of the last interviews Mahn Sha granted to international journalists, he posed in front of the Karen national flag hanging in his living room, and talked about the future of the Karen people and the KNU's fight for autonomy. He said the KNU's fighters would continue to battle the military junta in self-defense. ""Our struggle is the same struggle as the monks who protested in September, the same struggle as [pro-democracy activist] Aung San Suu Kyi,"" he said. ""Only in a different form, ours is a violent struggle, and we cannot give up until we have won."" The 64-year-old Mahn Sha was shot and killed in Mae Sot, Thailand, just across the border from Myanmar, a KNU official said. As Thai police investigate his killing, speculation has varied on how the Karen leader was killed. There have been suggestions the killing may have been the result of internal differences within the rebel group. But some Karen blame Myanmar's military junta. The government has not commented. The killing came just days after Myanmar announced plans for a referendum on a new constitution, to be followed by a general election in 2010 as part of its ""road map to democracy."" The plan has been denounced by pro-democracy opposition leaders. A charismatic leader mourned . Mahn Sha was the KNU's third in command, but widely respected as the group's acting leader, said KNU Foreign Affairs spokesperson David Taw. His death is viewed by many as a major setback for the already struggling resistance movement. ""Mahn Sha [was] the strong guiding light,"" said Oscar Baaye, an ethnic Karen from the United States who was living with Mahn Sha prior to the rebel leader's death. Mahn Sha had been described as a skilled mediator between different Karen factions, as well as other ethnic groups in the region and those working for democracy in Myanmar. ""Mahn Sha's assassination was a blow to the entire democracy process,"" said Aung Zaw, editor of the Irrawaddy magazine. ""A lot of people saw him as a potential figure to work on national reconciliation. He was able to connect the Karen struggle to the bigger picture,"" he said. ""He built bridges between all groups, that was one of his strengths,"" said Phil Thornton, author of Restless Souls, who has been reporting on the Karen for seven years and lives in Mae Sot. Young Karen, in particular, said they felt inspired by Mahn Sha's approach to the democracy movement in Myanmar. ""He had a very clear vision of our struggle,"" said Nicky Zaw, who attended Mahn Sha's funeral. Dwindling numbers . The KNU's military, a ragtag group of soldiers who often wield World War II weaponry, has come under criticism, accused of recruiting child soldiers and carrying on what many have called an unwinnable war in civilian-occupied territory. The KNU has denied using child soldiers. In his interview, Mahn Sha said that the KNU had the support and backing of the villagers who are caught in the middle of this conflict. ""The military regime might have big numbers, but they don't have the support of the people,"" he said, claiming that for every KNU soldier there are at least 25 government soldiers. ""We can protect them because we have their support,"" he said. Still, humanitarian groups such as the Free Burma Rangers regularly report attacks in Karen villages by the military regime carrying out counterinsurgency operations. Thousands have fled the fighting. Prior to his death, Mahn Sha had just returned from a Karen Unity Seminar, in which Karen from around the world gathered at a secret headquarters in Myanmar to discuss the future of their movement and their people. The KNU has been fighting the government of Myanmar for about 60 years, since shortly after the departure of the British from the country then known as Burma in 1948. It is one of the world's longest-running insurgencies. But during the past decade, their troop numbers have dwindled from 20,000 to a mere 4,000, said David Taw. The KNU has suffered huge losses as members tire of war and resettle in places such as Europe and the United States, he said. The group also still suffers from crippling infighting and another splinter group, a faction commonly called the Karen National Union Peace Council, recently broke ranks to sign a peace agreement with the government of Myanmar-- like many other groups. While KNU leaders have been clear that they will continue their battle against Myanmar's military regime, they say the loss of Mahn Sha was a huge blow for the movement. At Mahn Sha's funeral, more than 1,000 mourners gathered in the jungle inside Myanmar, including representatives from nearly every regional ethnic group and Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party.

"(BudgetTravel.com) -- To whet your appetite for earning miles (without flying!), several major airlines are offering sign-up bonuses this fall for their mileage dining programs. Your favorite restaurant might offer from 1 to 10 miles for every dollar you spend. But are those miles enough to justify the logistical hassle of signing up and dining at designated restaurants? The value of these programs depends on 1) taking advantage of some of the current sign-up bonuses; 2) having at least one participating restaurant near where you live and that you might dine at every other month; and 3) using the mile activity as a way to keep your frequent flier accounts active. Budget Travel: Southwest waters down its rapid rewards program . One of the biggest things to change in the past year for these programs has been the development of smartphone apps. Now, instead of having to bring along a clunky, quickly outdated paper directory of participating restaurants, you can get a real-time list of what spots will earn you miles. Another change in recent years has been consolidation in the industry, with only one company Rewards Network, running all of the major programs. This change has allowed programs to become simplified and standardized. If a restaurant participates in the program for United, it probably also does for Delta, too, and you can use the same downloadable app for your smart phone to figure it out. If you have more than one dining card, you can double up on your rewards. Here's the lowdown on how these programs work: It's free to sign up for a dining card that gives airline credit every time you use it. Rewards Network, for instance, will (typically) give you three United miles for every mile you spend at a restaurant. At a value of about a penny a mile, that credit amounts to a 5 percent rebate on a family of four's typical restaurant check. Compared with some charge-cards, that's a decent mileage payoff. No wonder more than 3 million travelers are enrolled in these programs. All the dining programs work in a similar way. You sign up online for free at the sites (see the list, below), punching in your frequent flier number and registering a debit or credit card (American Express, Discover, MasterCard, Visa.) Use the card to pay your bill (including food, beverage, tax and tip) at a participating restaurant, and then miles will be automatically credited to your frequent flier account. No need to tell the waiter. As I mentioned, sign-up bonuses can juice up your earnings. To use United as an example again because it's so large, its dining program currently offers 1,000 mile bonus for signing up and spending at least $50 at a participating restaurant by the end of the year. Budget Travel: Ads on boarding passes -- Are airlines sharing your info? These are the sweetest bonuses being offered now: . Alaska Airlines . Bonus: Earn an additional 500 miles if you spend $25 at a participating restaurant within a month of signing up. Delta . Bonus: Earn 1,000 miles if you spend $25 at a participating restaurants within a month of signing up. Southwest Rapid Rewards Dining . Bonus: Spend $25 at participating restaurants within two months of signing up and you'll receive 300 points . United . Bonus: Earn 1,000 miles extra for signing up and spending at least $50 at a participating restaurant by the end of the year. US Airways . Bonus: Earn 1,000 points if you spend $25 or more on two different occasions between now and the end of the year at participating restaurants. Another perk of dining cards: It's a no-sweat way to keep your frequent flier mileage accounts active and prevent the qualifying miles you earn by actually flying from expiring after the typical 18-month span. (Miles will usually be deleted if an account is stagnant for 18 months.) The first step in deciding if the programs are worth it to you is to see if local restaurants that you love participate. It's understandable to be suspicious that restaurants must be bad to have to throw 5 miles per dollar at you to eat at them. But because of the recession many eateries are becoming more competitive. You can always ask a waiter, of course, to see if the restaurant participates. Or you can download a free app to find participating restaurants. The largest dining club program, Rewards Network is a good example to use, as the major airlines United/Continental, American, Delta, Southwest, and US Airways all belong. Find a participating restaurant by downloading one of these free apps: Blackberry, iPhone/iPad, Android . There are some annoying downsides to the programs, though: One is that you can often only earn credit once per month (or a similar limit) at any one restaurant. The other is that, if you're not careful in the e-mail preferences you fill out, you could be blitzed with messages from participating restaurants. If you block the e-mails, however, you could get only one mile per $1 spent -- or worse, maybe even nothing. The things a budget-conscious traveler has to put up with these days!

"(CNN) -- A suicide bombing ""mastermind"" in the Pakistan Taliban has been gunned down and killed in the country's northeastern tribal region, just days after a major faction in the militant group announced it was breaking away over ideological differences. Gunmen riding in a car attacked Ashiqullah Mehsud, a senior commander in the leadership of the group known formally as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), in the village of Urmuz in North Waziristan on Thursday before speeding off, sources told CNN. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, while the TTP has yet to issue a statement. Mehsud was viewed as a successor to Qari Hussain Mehsud, the militant group's explosives expert whose notoriety includes allegedly recruiting children as suicide bombers. Deadly infighting . Pakistani intelligence sources believe the incident is the result of internal rivalries between TTP factions. The Pakistan Taliban has been beset with months of deadly infighting, culminating in an announcement early this month by the group's Mehsud faction that it would be going its own way after failing to convince the leadership to give up what it said were ""un-Islamic"" practices, such as attacks in public places, extortion and kidnappings. It's the first split since the TTP -- a coalition of militant groups -- was founded in 2007, seeking to establish its version of sharia law across Pakistan. Tensions within the TTP escalated after the group's leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in November last year, setting off a power struggle among top commanders of the TTP that led to violent clashes in which dozens of people were killed. Appointed by a tribal council, Mullah Fazlullah has stood at the helm of the TPP since Mehsud's death. He hails from the country's Swat valley and is the first TTP leader who is not a Mehsud. He has struggled to contain the internal frictions among the group's factions, especially those within the Mehsud tribe, which makes up the majority of the TTP. In a statement released last month, Azam Tariq, a spokesman for the breakaway Mehsuds, said the TTP leadership had ""fallen into the hands of a bunch of conspirators ... involved in criminal activities like robbery and extortion.""

"(CNN) -- The director of the embattled Phoenix VA Health Care System remains on the government's payroll more than four weeks after President Barack Obama pledged to hold accountable Veterans Affairs officials involved in fraudulent scheduling practices. Acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson said Director Sharon Helman and two other officials at the Phoenix VA have been ""removed"" from their positions, but he said the government continues to pay federal employees during the sometimes lengthy termination process. Speaking at the Washington, D.C., VA Medical Center on Wednesday, Gibson said actions have been taken to recover the more than $9,000 in bonuses Helman received for 2013, but he did not know if she had paid back the funds yet. He clarified that no senior Veterans Health Administration officials will receive performance bonuses in 2014 due to the ongoing controversy. When CNN interviewed Helman in April, she denied any wrongdoing and welcomed an investigation by the VA's Office of Inspector General. Gibson has toured VA medical centers in three cities in the last week, meeting with hospital staff and outlining his plan to reform the embattled federal health care system that has delayed or failed to provide appointments for more than 120,000 veterans in the past decade, according to an internal VA audit. ""I will use every bit of authority I have at my disposal to hold people accountable who have committed acts of woeful misconduct,"" Gibson said. Gibson said he expects to ""take action"" against officials at a particular VA medical center this week after receiving more information from the VA's Office of Inspector General. He would not specify which facility. Although he said problems with manipulated wait lists in the VA are systemic, Gibson is not aware of any individuals being terminated outside of Phoenix. At a news conference on May 21, Obama said, ""Anybody found to have manipulated or falsified records at VA facilities has to be held accountable."" Obama named Gibson, the former president and CEO of the USO, the VA's interim secretary after Eric Shinseki resigned May 30. Responding to CNN's questions about when long wait times will be reduced, Gibson said his top priority is to ensure veterans receive timely, high-quality health care, but he does not know exactly when all wait lists will be reduced. ""I can't stand up here and say, 'By this date we are going to have every veteran seen within less than 30 days.' I want to be able to say it but I just can't do it yet,"" he said. Gibson described numerous steps he has directed the VA to take in order to fix the broken system, including adding appointments for veterans on wait lists, increasing funding for staff to work overtime, expanding clinic hours, making room for walk-in appointments and leasing new space for medical care. He added that he wants to change the VA's culture of discouraging whistle-blowers from speaking out. ""Retaliating against whistle-blowers is against the law,"" he said. ""The last thing in the world you want to do is create an environment where people are afraid or unwilling to raise their hand and say 'I think there is a better way.'""

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities say they have arrested a fugitive in rural Florida who was on the lam for 30 years after faking a heart attack to escape from prison. A handwritten document buried in a file led cold case investigators to Ian Jackson MacDonald, 71, the U.S. Marshals Service said in a statement. They arrested him Tuesday in Homosassa, Florida. ""I was told that he just let out a big sigh and said, 'Yeah, you're right -- you got me,'"" U.S. Marshals senior Inspector Barry Golden told CNN affiliate CBC News. Authorities allege that MacDonald, who went by the nickname ""Big Mac,"" faked a heart attack while he was in a federal prison in South Miami-Dade County in 1980. He later escaped from a hospital, the U.S. Marshals said. MacDonald had been awaiting extradition on a Canadian warrant to face outstanding charges for allegedly smuggling 500 pounds of marijuana. After less than a day in the hospital, he persuaded a security guard to unshackle his legs so he could take a shower, the U.S. Marshals said in a statement. ""The security guard walked to the nurse's station, and when he returned, MacDonald was gone,"" the statement said. People in Pennsylvania and West Virginia knew MacDonald by a different name -- Jack Hunter, CNN affiliate WTOV reported. U.S. Marshals allege that MacDonald and his wife changed their names and moved to southwest Pennsylvania after he escaped from custody. He owned a store in nearby West Virginia, ""19th Hole Used Appliances,"" WTOV said. ""It's really surprising that someone can live in your neighborhood for that long undetected,"" resident Jim Lyle told WTOV. Investigators in Pennsylvania learned that MacDonald and his wife were living in a Florida mobile home they had purchased in 2009. Authorities there arrested him outside the home Tuesday. ""I have been looking over my shoulder all these years. I wondered when this day would come,"" MacDonald reportedly told investigators, the U.S. Marshals said. According to the U.S. Marshals, Canadian authorities said their arrest warrant for importation of marijuana was still active, and MacDonald could still face charges in Canada.","Inspector: ""He just let out a big sigh and said, 'Yeah, you're right -- you got me'""

"(CNN) -- It took until the presidential campaign was over, but Mitt Romney finally figured out the sinister plan Barack Obama executed to win re-election. Here's how it worked: During his first term, Obama craftily carried out policies that helped improve Americans' lives, thereby tricking them into voting to re-elect him. Diabolical! OK, that wasn't exactly how he put it. But in a conference call with his major donors after the campaign ended, Romney attributed his loss to the fact that Obama gave ""gifts"" to various groups to win their loyalty. Young people, women, Latinos, African-Americans, all voted for Obama because he showered them with presents, he concluded. ""With regards to the young people, for instance, a forgiveness of college loan interest was a big gift,"" Romney said. ""Free contraceptives were very big with young, college-aged women. And then, finally, Obamacare also made a difference for them, because as you know, anybody now 26 years of age and younger was now going to be part of their parents' plan, and that was a big gift to young people."" Romney's interpretation of the election results provides an apt footnote to his campaign, an encore performance of the infamous ""47%"" videotape. And that was hardly an isolated incident; you'll recall that Romney spent weeks attacking the Obama administration for supposedly eliminating the work requirements in welfare. ""You wouldn't have to work,"" said a Romney ad. ""They just send you your welfare check."" The claim was false, but it sent the message he wanted: Obama was the candidate of the moocher class, the leeches who wanted only to luxuriate in their unearned benefits while good people worked for a living. But this idea didn't just occur to Romney out of nowhere. If in the last couple of years you've been listening to conservative talk radio, watching Fox News or even attending panel discussions at tony conservative think tanks in Washington, you've heard this analysis again and again. As the title of a recent book by a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute has it, we've become ""A Nation of Takers,"" selfishly grabbing what we can while hoping someone else will pay for it all. And since the election, one conservative after another has been complaining about those ungrateful Americans with their hands out. ""There are 50% of the voting public who want stuff. They want things,"" said Bill O'Reilly on Election Night. ""And who is going to give them things? President Obama."" Which brings us back to the word Romney used over and over on that phone call: ""gift."" Apparently, he believes that when the government works to ensure that everyone has access to health care, or that young people can afford to attend college, it's kind of like giving a kid a new Xbox -- he didn't need it, he probably didn't deserve it, but we gave it to him anyway so there won't be any tantrums for a while. You might say that a guy who doesn't have an actual job, yet pulls in $20 million a year on which he pays 14% in federal income taxes because of how the tax system is so skewed in his favor perhaps should not be talking so contemptuously about the government giving people gifts. But in the world that Romney and his wealthy donors inhabit, policies that benefit the upper class can't possibly be ""gifts."" Is eliminating the estate tax a gift? Heavens, no. It's just a way to encourage investment, which is good for all of us. Only benefits that accrue to the common folk are gifts, those undeserving masses gauche enough to send their children to public schools (another gift), who worry about finding insurance if they have a pre-existing condition, who think that clean air and water are things everyone deserves. The truth is that we are all both takers and givers, at different times and in different ways. We pay taxes and we get benefits from government, both collective (such as national defense and clean air) and individual (such as Medicare). We take from our parents, then give to our children. We're individuals who make our own way, but we also live in a society where we depend on one another every day. For all the pettiness and silly attacks we saw in this election, there was also a genuine and enlightening philosophical debate. Republicans tried to paint the nation as an Ayn Rand fantasy world in which there are only two kinds of people: the brave individualists needing nothing from anyone, and the blood-sucking parasites who rely on government. The voters took a look at that fantasy and decided it wasn't true. But Romney still believes it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Waldman.","Paul Waldman: Romney now sees Obama won by diabolically helping voters with policies .
He says Romney told donors these ""gifts"" aimed at blacks, Hispanics, women, young .
Waldman: This idea not new from the right -- tax breaks not ""gifts,"" but public benefits are .
Waldman: Election actually revealed this disconnect, and voters showed they didn't buy it ."
"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Barack Obama, who shot from obscurity to fame based on a single speech and then captured the White House in a campaign marked by soaring rhetoric, delivered a restrained, sober inaugural address Tuesday. American patriot Thomas Paine seems to have informed some of the spirit of President Obama's inaugural speech. Gone was the mantra-like ""Yes we can"" chanted by supporters, which Obama invoked as a refrain right through his victory speech on Election Night. Largely absent, too, were citations from the two historical figures on whose shoulders Obama stood Tuesday -- Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr., both of whom he quoted on the night of his triumph in November. He took his oath of office on Lincoln's 1861 inaugural Bible, closing a circle of symbolism that began when he declared his candidacy for president two years ago on the same spot in Illinois where Lincoln launched his own first campaign. But other than mentioning ""the lash of the whip,"" an echo of Lincoln's towering second inaugural address, and ""gathering clouds and raging storms,"" Obama did not seem to quote the 16th president. And, perhaps thinking that the simple fact of an African-American being sworn in as president was sufficiently drenched with significance, he made only the most glancing reference to King. ""We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and nonbelievers,"" Obama said, a contemporary variation on King's hope that ""Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics"" would one day join hands and sing.  Watch President Obama's full speech » . In fact, if the speech could be said to have an animating spirit, it was that of Thomas Paine, the great 18th-century pamphleteer who played a key role in the American and French revolutions. Obama referred to ""the rights of man,"" the title of a book Paine wrote in praise of the French Revolution. And his speech ended with a long quote from Paine that George Washington ordered read to his troops when the revolt looked bleak for the Colonies: ""Let it be told to the future world ... that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive ... that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet (it.)"" The passage comes from Paine's critical 1776 essay ""The Crisis,"" which famously begins: ""These are the times that try men's souls."" Indeed, Obama used the word ""crisis"" four times in his speech -- one more time than he used the word perhaps most closely identified with him: Hope. ""That we are in the midst of a crisis is now well-understood,"" Obama said, in a speech that warned Americans to prepare for a long, hard -- but certain -- slog toward better days. He drew on the touchstones of American civic life, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, with phrases such as ""we the people,"" ""common defense"" and ""all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness."" He nodded towards John F. Kennedy with a reference to ""rising tides of prosperity"" and Franklin Roosevelt in saying Americans had chosen ""hope over fear."" And he seemed to carry on a bit of an argument with Ronald Reagan, listing key battlefields in American history (""Concord and Gettysburg, Normandy and Khe Sahn""), as Reagan did in his first inaugural, but rejecting the most famous phrase from that speech.  Watch CNN's Fareed Zakaria discuss writing a memorable speech » . ""Government is not the solution to the problem, government is the problem,"" Reagan declared in 1981. No, Obama seemed to respond 28 years later, ""The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works. ... Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end ... because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government."" He also borrowed a notion associated with Reagan, but running through American history right back to the Puritans, who in turn took it from the book of Isaiah: that American ideals ""still light the world."" And his conclusion bookended the two great sources of quotes in the English language, Shakespeare and the Bible. America, he said, may be experiencing ""this winter of our hardship"" -- riffing on Richard III's ""winter of our discontent"" -- but will prove ""when we were tested"" -- as Abraham was by God -- ""we refused to let this journey end ... with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The family of Frank Buckles, the nation's lone living veteran of World War I, hopes he makes it to his 110th birthday about a month from now, despite troubling signs he is on the decline. Buckles, who was born February 1, 1901, is thought to be the world's oldest living war veteran. Buckles has slowed down considerably in just the past two months, according to his daughter Susannah Buckles Flanagan, who lives with him at the family home near Charles Town, in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia. A family friend who visited two weeks ago says he is awake just a few hours a day. ""When he's awake, he's there with us,"" said David DeJonge, a Michigan portrait photographer who has spent the past decade documenting the final few veterans from the war that ended 92 years ago. With only one veteran left, DeJonge spends the remaining time helping Buckles represent the memory of his comrades. Despite his advanced age, Buckles had been coming to Capitol Hill to try to persuade lawmakers to grant federal status to an existing World War I monument in Washington that was built in the 1930s. The monument currently honors only those who served from the District of Columbia. ""I have to,"" Buckles told CNN when he came to Washington a year ago to testify as part of what he considers his responsibility to those who've gone before him. Although passed by the House, the legislation, known as the Frank Buckles Memorial Act, remains stalled in the Senate. Passage would bestow federal status to both the D.C. location and another WWI memorial in Kansas City, Missouri. His family is concerned he may never live to see the bill enacted. Last month, Buckles was not strong enough and could not make a trip to Washington to review renovations as they began at the D.C. War Memorial. The National Park Service hosted a tour showing the first real improvements in decades at the site, fixing a neglected walkway and dressing up a deteriorated dome and marble columns. Learning of Buckles' decline, the office of Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-West Virginia, sent word to the family last week that ""she would like to offer her thoughts and prayers to him,"" at a time ""Mr. Buckles' health has taken a turn for the worse."" As an Army corporal in what was known as the Great War, Buckles drove an ambulance in France. Even if the monument becomes part of Buckles' legacy, his family is concerned the Pentagon has not fully considered what can be done to honor him after his death. His daughter says the Military District of Washington will support an honors burial at Arlington, including an escort platoon, a horse-drawn casket arrival, a band and a firing party. She has expressed concern that Army officials have told her they cannot provide honor staff for any related memorial services that don't take place at the National Cemetery. A proposal from Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, calls for ceremonies in the Capitol, where Buckles' casket would be displayed with honors. The family is concerned they would have to bear the cost of supporting the display and that the U.S military would decline to participate. So DeJonge, the family friend who also serves as president of the WWI Memorial Foundation, told CNN he has asked American allies to help give Buckles a proper sendoff when the time comes. ""The French are in,"" DeJonge confirmed, ""they plan to send a Defense Ministry official, and hope to contribute at least two honor guards and pallbearers."" A British defense official has told the family that the UK would send the air-vice marshal and possibly the British ambassador. ""It has long been my father's wish to be buried in Arlington, in the same cemetery that holds his beloved General (John. J.) Pershing (commander of the American Expeditionary Forces in WWI),"" Flanagan wrote, appealing for help from Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia. ""I feel confident that the right thing will come to pass.""","Family: Health of U.S. World War I veteran, 109, is declining .

"Pittsburgh (CNN) -- People ask me why a doctor would dress like a homeless person and make house calls under bridges. I say enthusiastically, ""Why not!?"" That's just what I did in 1992 in an effort to take my medical teaching career beyond the walls of the hospital. Dressing like a homeless person seemed the best way to initially enter the street community, which I sincerely wanted to do. I had come to a point where I needed a new ""classroom"" in which medical students could fully experience the reality of those who did not make it into effective medical care. We needed to understand how health care is shaped by the real life experiences of those who struggle with difficult circumstances. If there were any people who could teach us those lessons, I believed it would be the people who were living under the bridges of Pittsburgh. Initially, I didn't tell the hospital (or my malpractice carrier) what I was doing. My guide was a formerly homeless expert, Mike Sallows. Together, we made house calls under the bridges, along the riverbanks and in the abandoned buildings of Pittsburgh. A whole new world opened to me. The depth of medical need I saw was exceeded only by the hopelessness of the people I came to know. Each person became inconveniently real to me, and going home to my warm bed became increasingly difficult. But what I also discovered was the profound satisfaction of bringing care directly to those who would otherwise have none. I was becoming part of the street world. Another reality . In the homeless camps and in the alleys, I found people who had suffered extremes of weather, violence and prejudice. Many were older, confused people; some were war veterans holding on to the last shreds of their dignity; others were simply people who had fallen on hard times and lost hope. I saw hideous leg ulcers and cancers that were untreated. But mostly I saw human beings who had minimal access to loving, effective services. The street homeless live in another reality. It is often brutal and short. Health issues are secondary to immediate survival, but according to the National Coalition for the Homeless, the average life expectancy among that population is estimated between 42 and 52 years, compared with 78 years in the general population. This essentially makes street homelessness one of the most fatal conditions in the United States. As I watched more and more people die out there, these numbers became a very real experience. Looking in from the streets, I saw my community as a largely hostile, unforgiving place. The reaction of the non-homeless to those sleeping on the streets is often negative. I know this is born from frustration, but I believe that as long as ignorance and fear dictate how we perceive others, we have little hope of building effective, inclusive solutions. We must get close enough to know each other. I am also convinced that by ""going to the people,"" health care can learn to engage people on their terms, holistically building health solutions grounded in their reality. This will potentially make health care delivery more cost effective and efficient as the principles of ""street medicine"" are applied to other populations. How much we can learn from those who are left out! A model for Street Medicine . As word of our work spread beyond the streets, other volunteers and students joined the effort. Operation Safety Net was officially founded under the Pittsburgh Mercy Health System in 1993. According to the group's records, as of 2014, more than 10,000 homeless individuals have been reached with more than 68,000 visits to the street homeless of Pittsburgh. More than 900 chronically homeless persons have achieved housing directly through Operation Safety Net efforts. Significantly, for the first time, the medical care of the street homeless is coordinated within the entire city. Students from all over the world now come to Pittsburgh to work with Operation Safety Net, many starting street medicine programs of their own in cities such as Rochester, New York; Detroit; Santa Barbara, California; Prague; and Ibadan, Nigeria. In 2005, after extensive global networking, the first International Street Medicine Symposium was held in Pittsburgh. Each year, a different city hosts the meeting, which is the only forum for pioneers of the street medicine movement to meet and develop this new field of medicine. At the 2013 meeting in Boston, 200 enthusiastic professionals and students gathered from five continents. In 2009, the Street Medicine Institute was established with two visions: Every person in the world who remains on the streets will have direct access to health care, and every medical school will have a ""classroom"" in its own streets. The Street Medicine Institute provides consulting services to assist communities that seek to establish new street medicine programs and improve the care of their own street homeless populations. Under the umbrella of the Street Medicine Institute, there are now more than 40 street medicine programs in the U.S. and more than 90 programs worldwide. Increasingly, we are finding that by first addressing the immediate medical needs of those on the streets, pathways to housing, financial stability and recovery are being realized. We believe that by taking care of our own fallen citizens, but by doing it within a global vision, we reclaim the true spirit of health care and build better communities for ourselves.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the group that told women in their 40s that they don't need mammograms, will recommend that men not get screened for prostate cancer, according to a source privy to the task force deliberations. The task force is set to recommend a ""D"" rating for prostate specific antigen, or PSA, testing. Such a rating means ""there is moderate or high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits,"" according to the group's website. The task force is set to propose this recommendation Tuesday, and then allow for a comment period before issuing a final recommendation. According to a draft copy of a report released Friday, a review of studies shows screening with the PSA blood test results in ""small or no reduction"" in prostate cancer deaths. The report adds that PSA testing is ""associated with harms related to subsequent evaluation and treatments."" The PSA test, which is sometimes accompanied by a digital rectal exam, can help determine if a man has prostate cancer. The problem is that many of the cancers that get detected are so small and slow-growing, they'll never be harmful, and doctors have a difficult time discerning the quick, harmful cancers from the slow, harmless ones. Empowered Patient: What's a dude to do? If you test 100 men over age 50, 17 of them will have prostate cancer, and only three of those will have a fast-growing cancer and die of the disease, according to Dr. Kenneth Lin, senior author of the paper. If the 14 men with the slow-growing cancers are treated, they could be rendered impotent or incontinent from the treatment; or worse, the treatment could kill them. About one in 500 men who has a radical prostatectomy will die because of complications of the surgery, according to Lin. Some prostate cancer patients were disappointed with the task force's decision. A spokesman for the Prostate Cancer Foundation called the proposed recommendation ""a tremendous mistake."" ""You're talking to someone whose life was saved by [the PSA test],"" Dan Zenka said. But Lin says he believes testing does more harm than good. ""Maybe you should get tested if you have this horrible family history where everyone gets prostate cancer before the age of 50. But for most men, testing is harmful,"" he said. Until last year, Lin worked with the Preventive Services Task Force as a medical officer for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. He says the task force voted in 2009 to give PSA screening a ""D"" rating, but it didn't announce it because of the uproar over the mammogram recommendation. ""I was so frustrated with the political interference, and this was the final straw,"" said Lin, who left the group in November and is now an assistant professor of family medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center. CNN's Jennifer Bixler and Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.","NEW: Prostate Cancer Foundation spokesman calls recommendation a mistake .

"(CNN) -- Phillip Garrido had a story to tell -- about how God helped him overcome the evil inside him. Phillip Garrido, a registered sex offender, was arraigned in California on Friday. The campus at the University of California at Berkeley was his pulpit, and he hoped his neighbors and customers of his printing business would become his flock. He wanted to share his story with anyone who would listen, including law enforcement. Just days before he was arrested and an 18-year-old kidnap mystery was solved, Garrido walked into an FBI office in San Francisco, California, with a stack of documents. The purported writings were a two-part manifesto. First he discussed the ""Origin of schizophrenia revealed."" Some who know him say Garrido spoke of having schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder. In the second part of the documents, Garrido detailed his struggle with sexual urges, in writings he titled ""Stepping into the light."" In the documents, obtained by CNN, Garrido confessed his past aggressive sexual impulses, but said he is no longer that man.  Listen to Garrido speak of ""heartwarming"" story » . Garrido and his wife were charged last week with crimes relating to the abduction of 11-year-old Jaycee Lee Dugard in 1991 and her captivity in a hidden shed-and-tent compound in the couple's backyard in Antioch, California. They pleaded not guilty to charges of rape, kidnapping and false imprisonment.  See photos of Dugard's living conditions » . After his arrest, Garrido said documents he gave to the FBI would be key, that they would help people understand who he really was. He told a local television reporter the documents would show a ""heartwarming story,"" one that helped him ""completely"" turn his life around. KCRA: Read transcript of Garrido's interview after his arrest . The documents provide a glimpse into the mind of a man who said he thinks he has a God-given gift. The power to control minds with sound was his salvation, he said, and would help others before they committed violence. He wrote that he wanted to share his story to provide ""solid hope for everyone who suffers from the many forms of aggressive sexual behavior as well as other problematic behaviors."" Garrido spoke of his sexual urges during his trial in 1977, when he was convicted of abducting and raping a 25-year-old casino worker in a mini-warehouse. He spent 11 years in jail for those crimes. He testified about his sexual fantasies, which included masturbating while reading magazines, watching movies, and in restaurants or bathrooms. In his writings, he detailed how hard it was for him to control himself. Garrido wrote that he realized he couldn't control his impulses and they were plaguing the ones he loved. ""Certain behaviors cause a great deal of pain in myself and those who are victimized by those behaviors, especially our family and my wife,"" he wrote. That pain made him try to change from the predator he had become, he wrote. He said he began forcing himself to look at attractive women, but would not allow himself to act. ""See how beautiful she is to look at,"" he would tell himself. In time, Garrido wrote, he began to stop physically acting on his feelings. As time went on, Garrido wrote, he kept those sexual compulsions at bay, beginning with controlling masturbation, which he said in the past had often taken place in public. He wrote that he became free and able to experience sexual enjoyment for the first time with his wife, though it was unclear whether he was referring to Nancy, his legal wife, or to Dugard, the mother of two of his children. He claimed he realized how wrong he had been in the past. ""I realized I never needed to act or do the things I used to believe was so great and stimulating,"" Garrido wrote, referring to what he called ""one of the most powerful freedoms imaginable."" ""I began to weep telling her 'I am so sorry for the things I did in the past,' "" Garrido wrote about his wife, adding that he experienced a feeling of remorse he never had before. That feeling of salvation was something Garrido believed was a gift. He said he thought it meant it was up to him to help other sexual predators turn their lives around. ""It will begin to open a new pathway for us all. God willing, I will be teaching this and other skills Christ is providing for me in the prisons throughout the U.S. as well as overseas,"" he wrote.","Suspect Phillip Garrido gave FBI documents just days before he was arrested .

"New York (CNN) -- It's not every day that a 13-year-old boy gets a chance to address the United Nations General Assembly. But Felix Finkbeiner is no ordinary teenager. Finkbeiner is already the head of his own organization, Plant for the Planet, dedicated to planting millions of trees all around the world. At the U.N. earlier this month, Finkbeiner had one item on his agenda: taking adults to task for their lack of action on planting trees. In the normally staid U.N., Finkbeiner had a field day telling off a group of adults. His message to the diplomats was simple: ""stop talking and start planting."" Finkbeiner warned the countries that disappearing trees would create a climate crisis for children's future. ""We children understand that the adults know everything about these crises, but we children don't understand why there's so little action,"" he said. Plant for the Planet was founded in, of all places, a fourth grade classroom in his native Germany. A presentation Finkbeiner gave in class about Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai, who planted 30 million trees in Kenya, inspired the movement. But Finkbeiner believes this tree crusade can only be successful if it is led by children. ""We children are the majority in the world but we can only make a difference if we work together. So we have to work together because if we do this, we can have a big impact,"" he says. This tree-planting campaign has already had an impact worldwide. Finkbeiner says there are 100,000 children participating in 91 countries with 3.5 million trees planted. Maathai, who also addressed the U.N. on the same occasion, was impressed with Finkbeiner's success. ""It is an indication of the kind of inspiration and hope we should all have because when they start this young with the conviction and the commitment, then you know definitely there's hope."" After her speech, Maathai and Finkbeiner shared some tree talk and a hug in the hall. Later on further uptown, Finkbeiner addressed an entire audience of teens at a New York City middle school. His speech was a battle cry to his peers. ""It's not about saving the polar bear. It's about saving our future."" Finkbeiner offered the students, who rarely see trees in the concrete jungle of Manhattan, some suggestions on planting trees. He encouraged the students to organize tree-planting parties in their community. Twitter and Facebook could be used to spread the word on tree events, Finkbeiner told the curious group of youngsters. For those seeking even more sophisticated means of getting news out, Finkbeiner offered tips on writing press releases. Jonathan Mejia, a student who attended the presentation, left feeling inspired to ""go out with a couple of my friends to a park and plant a lot of trees in a common area that everyone goes, like maybe Central Park."" This is exactly the kind of momentum Finkbeiner hopes to inspire in children around the world. ""We cannot trust that the adults alone will save our future,"" the young tree ambassadors says. ""We have to take our future in our own hands.""","13-year-old Felix Finkbeiner is already the head of his own organization .

"(CNN) -- What a difference a day makes. On July 2, Stephanie Headley was counting the days she had left to live. The Ottawa woman is suffering from an autoimmune disease that, without expensive treatment, will cause her heart to fail. On July 3, thanks to a mysterious stranger who showed up at her door, she had in her hands more than enough money to get the treatment that can save her life. Two weeks later, she still struggles to explain the dramatic change in her fortune. ""This is a miracle"" she told CNN partner CBC, referring to the mystery donor as an ""angel that walks among us."" Hope with a cost . For 12 long years, the single mother of four has battled systemic scleroderma. The disease causes her body to overproduce collagen, making her skin, vital organs and blood vessels hard. Eventually the disease would have caused her heart to fail. And Headley says she felt time was running out. But Headley had hope. She told the Canadian TV stations, CBC and CTV, that she'd found a doctor in Chicago who could do a stem cell treatment. One with an 80% success rate. However, the treatment came with a hefty $125,000 (US$ 116,000) price tag -- far out of reach for Headley. Turning to the Internet . In the age of the Internet, Headley and her family did what many others in similar situations do: they started a fundraising page online. Money began coming in. And on July 3, a man called the house saying he too wanted to donate. Looking back, Headley remembers there were unusual things about the phone call. He had a monotone voice, a deliberately altered one. Maybe it was so she wouldn't recognize him, Headley told CBC. The stranger also said he'd bring a bank draft, which made Headley think his donation could be substantial. So, she wrote a thank you note and got ready to greet the man. The stranger at the door . The man turned up wearing reflective sunglasses, a hat and a coat buttoned all the way up. He handed her an envelope without the hint of a smile. He was ""completely stone-faced"" she told CBC. ""I handed him the thank you card."" Then as he turned to go, she said, ""I said 'God bless you.' Then he smiled a big smile."" He walked off. Headley went inside not knowing what the envelope contained. ""When I opened it, I thought I was seeing the numbers wrong, the decimals wrong, the zeroes wrong."" The draft was for $128,000 (US$ 119,000) A windfall . Headley couldn't believe it. She collapsed, she cried. She even hyperventilated, she told CBC. ""I said 'Thank you God! Oh my God, I'm going to be saved!'"" Then when she regained her wits and walked outside to seeif she could find her benefactor he was gone. There was no trace of the tall, slender man with the big check. But if they could find him, Headley told CTV, ""I would give him a big hug"" and tell him, ""You have absolutely saved my family."" Skylar Skinkle, Headley's daughter, summed it up best. She told CTV: ""This is my mom's life on a piece of paper.""

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Las Vegas may never be the same now that Britney Spears has started a residency in Nevada's Sin City. ""Britney: Piece of Me"" debuted at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino this weekend, almost 10 years to the day that Spears married a high school friend at a wedding chapel just down the Vegas strip. Her marriage to Jason Alexander lasted just 55 hours before it was annulled, but Spears' new relationship with Vegas is planned for at least two years. She is reportedly earning $300,000 per show -- $30 million for the 100 shows through 2015. Spears dances on a 100-foot stage, backed by 14 dancers and one of the world's largest video installations. She enters from a spherical cage that descends from above. Near the end, Spears leaps from a giant tree, flying across the stage on a cable. While her microphone is live and Spears appears to be singing, much of what the audience hears is from pre-recorded tracks of 21 hits from her pop career. A live four-piece band plays behind Spears, visible on scaffolding at the rear of the stage. But evidence that much of it is pre-produced comes when Will.i.am appears on video to perform ""Scream & Shout"" with Spears. Backing tracks for vocals are not new or unexpected, considering that Spears is running around the stage for most of the 90-minute show. The 4,600 people attending her opening night Friday seemed willing to suspend any disbelief. They also mouthed the familiar lyrics to ""Baby One More Time,"" ""Oops I Did It Again,"" ""Toxic,"" ""Circus,"" ""Womanizer"" and ""Slave 4 U."" She includes songs from her just-released album ""Britney Jean."" Unlike most Vegas shows, the theater seats are almost unnecessary. The crowd stood through most of the show as if they were in a nightclub dancing to a DJ. Planet Hollywood describes the remodeled Axis Theater as ""part nightclub and part theater."" The VIP section includes bottle service, tables and a dance floor. Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, Selena Gomez and Mario Lopez were among Spears' celebrity friends in the VIP section on opening night. Tickets to the VIP area are in big demand, according to Robin Leach, the ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"" host who now covers Las Vegas nightlife. One Vegas business owner is negotiating to buy the front-center VIP table for every show, he said. Spears takes a break after playing the New Year's Eve show, returning on January 29 to begin three shows a week for the next month. Shows are scheduled in four-week segments in April and May and again in August and September. A younger Las Vegas . Spears' arrival signals another phase in a trend toward a younger Las Vegas that began with nightclubs paying famous DJs big dollars to play electronic dance music. ""The demographic of Vegas has been sliding in the last two years, much younger and the emphasis now is not so much on gaming,"" said Leach. The younger tourists are shopping, eating, drinking and going to nightclubs, he said. A fan who was just 6 when Spear's first single -- ""Baby One More Time"" -- topped the pop charts 15 years ago is now 21 and old enough to fly to Las Vegas and party. Spears, who turned 32 this month, ""is the obvious and natural choice"" to take advantage of the younger Vegas because of her fan following,"" Leach said. ""When you look at the landscape of pop stars, pop princesses, pop queens, there's nobody other than Britney who has the depth of a career and the number of albums,"" he said. ""She has a huge repertoire to go to."" Others will soon follow Spears, Leach predicted. Celine Dion made Las Vegas hot for older superstars when her Caesar's Palace residency began a decade ago, he said. ""Celine brought in Elton (John), Celine brought in Rod Stewart, Celine brought in Shania (Twain),"" he said. ""Who's Britney going to bring in?"" Bruno Mars, whose first song hit the charts just three years ago, began a mini-residency of headlining eight shows at The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas Sunday night.","Britney Spears is reportedly earning $30 million for the 100 Vegas shows through 2015 .

It was the fifth time Underwood snagged the award and her third win in a row. Before accepting her buckle, Underwood performed ""Somethin' Bad,"" her duet with fellow country superstar Miranda Lambert, who won female video of the year for her tune ""Automatic.""

"(CNN) -- Supporters of Proposition 8, California's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage, are asking that a judge's injunction barring the measure's enforcement be thrown out because the judge failed to disclose his involvement in a long-term same-sex relationship. In August, then-U.S. Chief Judge Vaughn Walker ruled the measure violates the Constitution's equal protection clause. ""Proposition 8 does nothing more than enshrine in the California Constitution the notion that opposite-sex couples are superior to same-sex couples,"" Walker wrote in his 136-page opinion. But on April 6, Walker ended months of speculation by publicly disclosing ""that he is gay and that he has been in a committed relationship for more than 10 years,"" said a motion filed Monday by Proposition 8 backers. In previous press reports, according to the motion, Walker refused comment on his sexual orientation. While the press reports do not address the question of whether Walker and his partner have any interest in marrying, the motion said, Walker should have either recused himself from the case or disclosed his sexual orientation ""so that the parties could consider and decide, before the case proceeded further, whether to request his recusal."" Walker, who retired at the end of February, told reporters earlier this month he didn't think it was appropriate for any judge's sexual orientation, ethnicity, national origin or gender to stop them from presiding over a case, according to a Reuters report. ""That's a very slippery slope,"" said Walker, who was appointed to the federal bench in 1989 by President George H.W. Bush. But, argues the motion filed Monday, if Walker and his partner ever wanted -- or thought they might want -- to marry, he ""plainly had an 'interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding,'"" it said, citing federal law regarding disqualification of judges. ""Only if Chief Judge Walker had unequivocally disavowed any interest in marrying his partner could the parties and the public be confident that he did not have a direct personal interest in the outcome of the case,"" the motion said. Same-sex marriage advocates decried the move. ""Supporters of Proposition 8 are grasping at straws because they don't like the outcome,"" said Michael Cole-Schwartz of the Human Rights Campaign. ""If their real intent was to 'protect marriage,' they should argue that a straight married judge be disqualified since he would conceivably have an interest in protecting his own marriage. The argument is simply ridiculous on its face."" However, Peter Sprigg, senior fellow for policy studies at the conservative Family Research Council, said he supports the motion. ""The fact that Judge Walker was biased in a generic sense was obvious from his decision itself,"" Sprigg said. ""But the revelation that he has been in a long-term homosexual relationship demonstrates that he had a very specific interest in the case which should have been disclosed."" ""I think there is zero chance of the decision being overturned because of this purported conflict, but it might have been wiser for Judge Walker to make this disclosure before taking on the case,"" said Jeffrey Toobin, CNN legal analyst. The motion says that proceedings in the case have been ""marked by a number of irregular and unprecedented rulings, both procedural and substantive, that give gravely disquieting force to the 'appearance of partiality' created by the belated disclosure of Chief Judge Walker's long-term, committed relationship."" It cites several examples, among them the fact that Walker refused to stay his judgment pending appeal despite its ""unprecedented nature ... and its sharp conflict with the uniform judgment of appellate courts throughout the country."" As a result, the motion argues, the Ninth Circuit was forced to issue such a stay. The Proposition 8 backers emphasize that in the motion, they are not suggesting a gay or lesbian judge could not hear the case -- only that no judge should try a case where they might have an interest in the outcome. ""We deeply regret the necessity of this motion,"" it says. ""In this case, it is undeniable that Chief Judge Walker failed to make the required disclosure. At no point prior to the entry of judgment did Chief Judge Walker disclose that he is in a now 10-year long, committed same-sex relationship. And he has yet to disclose whether he has any interest in marrying his partner should the injunction he issued be upheld on appeal,"" the motion said. ""... Simply stated, under governing California law, Chief Judge Walker currently cannot marry his partner, but his decision in this case, and the sweeping injunction he entered to enforce it, would give him a right to do so."" Toobin said the Proposition 8 supporters were not saying the judge shouldn't have heard the case because he is gay.  ""They're saying he couldn't hear the case because he was in precisely the kind of relationship that would be affected by his decision,"" he explained. ""I still think that is not necessarily disqualifying, because judges deal with issues that affect them in a broad sense all the time, but it might have been a better practice to put the cards on the table,"" he said.  ""... It gets to be a closer question when it's not just the general group affected, but the precise sub-group whose rights are at issue in the case."" While the argument is a legitimate one, Toobin predicted it will not succeed. ""It's all part of the strategy of litigating a high-profile case. You look for every advantage you can."" But, ""if Walker was willing to say something publicly after the case, he probably should have been willing to say something before the case,"" he said. ""... I think disclosure is almost always the better practice."" The civil rights challenge remains at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, and the issue remains unresolved, although a ruling is expected later this year. The court in December set aside Walker's decision, which would have allowed same-sex marriages to resume in California. Walker's ruling assured a swift federal appeal that ultimately may reach the U.S. Supreme Court. One sticking point could be whether Proposition 8 supporters in court -- all private citizens and groups -- have legal ""standing"" to continue appealing the case. If the appeals court rules they do not, the Supreme Court may not wade into the issue, some legal experts have said, giving no clear guidance on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage nationwide. The high court, in a 1997 unrelated appeal, expressed ""grave doubts"" about the ability of such private groups to challenge rulings that strike down ballot initiatives. The state's high court had allowed same-sex marriages in California, but then Proposition 8 passed with 52 percent of the vote in 2008. Prior to Walker's ruling, the California Supreme Court allowed that initiative to stand, saying it represented the will of the people.

"Zuffenhausen, Germany (CNN) -- With a top speed of 205 mph and a silhouette known and loved the world over, the Porsche 911 is an icon of German design and engineering. Since it was introduced nearly 50 years ago, its top speed has increased by 75 mph -- but the distinctive shape has remained almost unchanged. Unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1963, the designer was Ferdinand Alexander Porsche, then 25, grandson of the company's founder. Recalling the design process, he said: ""Right from the start the specification was that the car had to be instantly recognizable as a Porsche from its silhouette."" The two-door luxury coupe initially was called the Porsche 901, until a patent issue with Peugeot forced a change in name. The high-performance vehicle, today the carmaker's most expensive basic model, has remained in style over the years. Last year, Porsche delivered 21,680 units of the 911 worldwide, which accounted for about a quarter of the total vehicles it delivered during the 2009-2010 fiscal year. Such is the popularity of the model that the automaker recently designed a special 911 inscribed with names of its fans on the social networking site Facebook to celebrate reaching its millionth fan. There are now more than 1.3 million fans on the page. One of its biggest enthusiasts is Walter Roehrl, a rally legend who made his name racing in the 1970s and 1980s. The attention to engineering is what makes the 911 stand apart, according to Roehrl, who has been a senior test driver at Porsche for the last 17 years. The engine is ""so good,"" he said. ""That is the reason I like this car, because it's not the power, it's the response of this car."" Since it made its debut, the sports coupe has been modified for use by professional drivers, and it has one of the strongest competition track records of all time. At last year's Geneva Motor Show, Porsche unveiled the 911 GT3 R, its first hybrid track car. Roehrl said of the 911: ""It's the only car today which has the engine really in the back."" That gives it much better traction than compared to other racing vehicles. Roehrl recently took CNN's Diana Magnay for a spin around a Porsche test circuit in Zuffenhausen. She said: ""It's hard to explain what it's like when Roehrl puts his foot down. It's about precision at speed, not the actual speed itself."" Roehrl, who won 14 world rally championship races in his racing career, added: ""When I was a skier I always wanted the skis to be just an extension of my legs, and it's the same with the car. ""The car is a part of my body like my small finger. It has to do exactly what I want."" CNN's Diana Magnay and Catriona Davies contributed to this report .","The Porsche 911 -- originally called the 901 -- was unveiled at the 1963 Frankfurt Motor Show .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Land mine explosions have killed at least 73 people in Yemen's Abyan province since al Qaeda fighters were defeated two weeks ago, the Yemeni Defense Ministry said. Among those killed were 23 soldiers. The ministry said that tens of thousands of land mines were planted before militants were driven out of their key strongholds, as an ambush to retaliate for their defeat. A senior Defense Ministry official told CNN that more than 200 experts are involved in the mine removal operation, but he would not give a deadline for when the province would be mine-free. ""Al Qaeda had more than a year to plan and plant the land mines, so it will take time. We are also in dire need of modern detecting devices,"" the official told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to media. Top Yemen commander killed; al Qaeda claims responsibility . Residents in Abyan told CNN that the injury toll from mines is far greater than those killed. They said that most mines were planted near government institutions, military compounds, checkpoints, and mountainous roads. ""With every person killed, four or five are injured. Hospitals in Abyan and neighboring Aden are full of land mine victims,"" Ali Hadi, a resident of Zinjibar, told CNN. ""Zinjibar is still empty though, al Qaeda is nowhere to be seen. People know their lives are still at risk but this time from land mines,"" he added. Col. Saeed Ali Mishal, head of the engineering unit tasked with clearing the mines, said the government managed to clear 3,119 land mines this week from the towns of Zinjibar, Jaar, and Shuqra. ""Explosions linked to land mines are heard three to four times daily in Zinjibar,"" said Mishal. He said that the mines are all locally made and those found have been destroyed. The increasing death toll complicates government efforts to relocate locals displaced by the war. UNHCR, the U.N. refugee agency, reported that 150,000 people fled Abyan and are stranded in low-capacity shelters. The displaced currently occupy dozens of schools in Aden and Lahj provinces. Mohammed al-Saadi, Yemen's minister of international affairs, said one of the government's main priorities is to rebuild Abyan, after the year-long war destroyed thousands of homes.

"(CNN) -- At least two people have matched the winning numbers in Tuesday night's $636 million Mega Millions jackpot. One winning ticket was sold in Georgia, and the other was sold in California, lottery officials said. The winning numbers were 8, 14, 17, 20 and 39, with a Megaball of 7. Strong sales boosted the jackpot to $636 million from the previous estimate of $586 million, lottery officials announced late Tuesday morning. That's tantalizingly close to the U.S. record -- a $656 million Mega Millions jackpot split by three winning tickets in March 2012. This jackpot was so large in part because Mega Millions, in a sense, became tougher to win. The prize rises with each miss, and no one has won it since organizers increased the pool of numbers to choose from -- making astronomical odds even longer -- back in October. No lotteries in these 7 states . In Florida, $8,000 worth of tickets were sold every minute from 9 to 10 a.m. Tuesday, CNN affiliate WFTS reported, citing lottery officials. Mega Millions tickets go for $1 each, though buyers choose to pay an additional $1 for the Megaplier option, which could multiply lesser, non-jackpot winning prizes. A lottery player in the Bronx joked the jackpot wouldn't change his life. ""It would just change my vocabulary. I would say, 'I quit' (my job),"" he told CNN affiliate News 12 of New York on Tuesday morning at a gas station in the Bronx's Hunts Point neighborhood. At Bunny's Superette in Manchester, New Hampshire, a clerk told CNN affiliate WMUR that Mega Millions sales were brisk Tuesday -- she'd gone through four rolls of ticket paper by noon. One player there, Armand Lesage, said he'd like to use the jackpot to escape snowy New Hampshire for a warm vacation. But he'd also share with his large family. ""My mother had 19 of us, and that is a big family, and 14 are still living,"" he told WMUR. The chance of winning -- never particularly bright -- got worse in late October, when Mega Millions increased the drawing's pool of numbers. The odds of hitting the jackpot, which were 1 in 176 million, are now 1 in 259 million. You have more than 1,000 times better chance of an asteroid or comet killing you -- and that's using the longest estimated odds for the celestial bodies -- according to Tulane University. ""Winning the Mega Millions is akin to getting struck by lightning at the same time you're being eaten by a shark,"" Todd Northrop, founder of Lotterypost.com, told CNN. Previously, lottery players chose five numbers, ranging from 1 to 56. It's now 1 to 75, but the sixth, gold ball has fewer numbers from which to choose, as the pool decreased from 46 to 15. Mega Millions tickets are sold in 43 states -- all but Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Mississippi, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming -- plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. CNN's Christine Romans, Pamela Brown, Julie In, Devon Sayers and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","NEW: At least two winning tickets were sold, one in California and one in Georgia .

"(CNN) -- Attention American travel aficionados: There's no need to leave the United States to find the next hot destination. With Lonely Planet's Top 10 U.S. Destinations for 2013, innovative cuisine and drink, hopping art scenes and spectacular nature are available -- all without a passport. They include emerging destinations, locations that have something special for 2013 and longtime favorites with something new to offer visitors. ""U.S destinations are always going to be popular for U.S. residents,"" said Robert Reid, Lonely Planet's U.S. travel editor. ""It's a big country and we don't have as much vacation time as Europeans."" So consider putting that limited time to good use at one of these top destinations: . Louisville is the new Portland? Louisville, Kentucky, was named the top U.S. destination for 2013, following travel publisher Lonely Planet's discussions among its group of U.S. editors and authors. While they tend to debate entries into each year's Top 10 list, everyone agreed on Louisville, said Reid. While many horse lovers descend upon this Southern town the first Saturday in May to witness the Kentucky Derby, also known as the ""greatest two minutes in sports,"" there's more to Louisville than one horse race. With its hip bourbon scene (including microdistilleries), fine dining and emerging East Market District, also known as NuLu, Louisville may just be the new Portland, Oregon. Reid said. Consider exploring the city via the Urban Bourbon Trail for a powerful introduction to Kentucky's famous spirit. The rest of Lonely Planet's Top 10 destinations: Fairbanks, Alaska (2); San Juan Islands, Washington (3), Philadelphia (4); American Samoa (5); Eastern Sierra, California (6); northern Maine (7); Twin Cities, Minnesota (8); Verde Valley, Arizona (9); and Glacier National Park, Montana (10). Lonely Planet's Best Value worldwide destinations for 2013 . Nature is putting on a show . Fairbanks, Alaska, is the place to view the northern lights (aurora borealis) next year, when the sunspots put on a spectacular show in the sky. It's the end of an 11-year solar cycle so the show should be exceptionally beautiful. Go in late summer for the best view. And people who haven't seen Glacier National Park yet should visit soon. Beloved by Montana residents and visitors alike, most visitors enjoy the famous Going-to-the-Sun Road. However, the park's namesake glaciers are melting and could be gone by 2020 if the current warming trends continue, according to the National Park Service. The Eastern Sierra in California is just beyond Yosemite, allowing for exploration of hot springs, a gold rush ghost town and the amazing Devils Postpile National Monument's 60-foot curtain of basalt columns made from rivers of lava. Across the country, most visitors going to Maine stick to the shoreline. But the interior of northern Maine also has plenty for the active outdoors traveler. Not only is the Appalachian Trail's northern terminus located at Mount Katahdin in Baxter State Park, there are also miles of bike trails, canoe trips, rafting and a nearly 100-year-old steamboat ride at Moosehead Lake. The Spiritual Journey of the Appalachian Trail . The food and drink are divine . The lovely San Juan Islands north of Seattle have been coined ""the Gourmet Archipelago"" by Lonely Planet guidebook author Brendan Sainsbury. The area has plenty of not-Seattle-like sunshine and lots of fresh, local food.

Sainsbury recommends the Doe Bay Cafe on Orcas Island, and Willows Inn on Lummi Island. Beyond the red rocks, crystals and spa culture of Arizona, Verde Valley is blossoming as a wine community. The new Verde Valley Wine Trail near Sedona connects four vineyards around Cornville in northern Arizona. Classic American cities . Art is truly taking center stage in Philadelphia. True, the city has long had the Philadelphia Museum of Art with its Rocky-climbing steps. But with the move of the Barnes Foundation -- with its once-private collection of CÃ©zanne, Matisse and Renoir -- into the city, Philly is now the place to explore art. And the gallery scene is exploding in emerging neighborhoods like Fishtown and Northern Liberties -- with a restaurant and bar scene to enjoy while you're there. Minnesota's Twin Cities have long been known as bike-friendly, but the Nice Ride Minnesota bike-share system and its new bike lanes have made the region even more cyclist-friendly. Ride along the Mississippi River close to the headwaters and enjoy the beauty of the trails there. Prince still stops by the Minneapolis clubs to hear the latest bands, Reid promised. And you can also enjoy a show at Minnesota Public Radio's Fitzgerald Theater (named after St. Paul native F. Scott Fitzgerald) where Garrison Keillor tapes ""A Prairie Home Companion."" Keillor's next show is February 2, 2013, but there's plenty of other entertainment there in the meantime. Far away without a passport . While there's no need to have a passport when traveling to the U.S. territory of American Samoa, it will take most U.S. residents some time to get there. From already far-flung Hawaii, travelers take a nearly six-hour flight from Honolulu to Pago Pago on Tutuila. It's not a place most people can afford to go, but it's worth your consideration for the trip of a lifetime, said Reid. ""It's a dream South Pacific beach vacation,"" he said. Tutuila offers incredible beaches, waterfalls and even the National Park of American Samoa, but Reid recommends jumping on a quick connecting flight to the 3-square-mile Ofu in the Manu'a Islands, which features white-sand beaches flanked by palm trees and surrounded by shark-tooth-shaped mountains. While the editors recommend visiting on Flag Day, April 17, when the island celebrates big time, snorkeling and pure Polynesian bliss is available almost anytime.","Louisville, Kentucky came out on top for more than horses and bourbon .

"(CNN) -- Sexual harassment is part of everyday life in middle and high schools across the country, a new study released on Monday by a nonprofit research organization said, with the vast majority of students who have been harassed, reporting negative effects from it. ""Crossing the Line: Sexual Harassment at School,"" surveyed 1,965 students in grades 7-12 in May and June of 2011. The study, by the American Association of University Women, found that 48% of the students questioned experienced some form of sexual harassment in the current school year. ""Many of us think of sexual harassment as an adult issue,"" said Catherine Hill, the director of research at AAUW and one of the authors of the report. The study proves that many young people are also victims of these experiences, Hill said. Verbal harassment, which includes unwelcome sexual comments, jokes or gestures, made up the bulk of the incidents, but physical harassment was prevalent as well, and 30% of students experienced sexual harassment by text, e-mail, social networking sites like Facebook or other electronic means. According to the study, many of the students who were harassed through cyberspace were also harassed in person, a combination that caused the most serious effects. Students said they were ""sick to their stomach, had trouble sleeping, and even skipped school,"" when they were exposed to both forms of harassment, said Hill. The findings also showed that girls were more likely than boys to be sexually harassed, both in person and by electronic means. The results also confirm previous research which shows the experiences of girls tended to be more physical and intrusive than for boys. Thirty-three percent of girls and 24% of boys said they witnessed sexual harassment during the 2010-2011 school year, and 56 % said they saw more than one incident. ""It's an issue that affects people differently,"" said Hill. ""People need to take it seriously."" In recent years, sexual harassment among students hasn't gotten as much attention as bullying, but Hill said the two are interrelated. In an article on the AAUW website titled ""Sexual Harassment Versus Bullying,"" the similarities and differences are spelled out. Sexual harassment is defined as unwanted behavior that is sexual in nature, while bullying involves a power dynamic. The motivations behind them may be different, but the negative affects for students are often the same, according to the article. ""I think it's wonderful that bullying is getting attention,"" Hill said."" But I would like sexual harassment in that conversation,"" said Hill. Other differences between the two include the law. According to Hill, sexual harassment falls under federal guidelines, while bullying is regulated by individual states. Forty-four percent who admitted to sexually harassing others didn't think of it as a big deal, another 39% said they were trying to be funny. For Hill, the study offers fresh insight and new information on sexual harassment. ""I hope the information will be used to start a conversation about this difficult topic,"" said Hill. Students involved in the study offered ideas for reducing sexual harassment. Their suggestions include anonymous reporting, designating a person they can talk to, in-class discussions, and having more online resources available to them.","Study said nearly half of students surveyed experienced sexual harassment at school .

"(CNN) -- With its winding canals and large public parks sitting alongside a busy port and bustling business district, Hamburg is a city that contradicts itself. But by combining its industrial strength with a commitment to reduce its impact on the environment, Germany's second-largest city is becoming a model for major metropolises around the world. It's already lowered its carbon emissions by 15% since 1990, thanks largely to its efficient public transit system, and it's set a target of reducing its emissions by 40% by 2020 and 80% by 2050. Hamburg's eco-friendly credentials aren't immediately obvious to those visiting the city located on the River Elbe. ""It's embedded in their culture,"" says Anna Shepard from Green Traveller, a website that specializes in helping travelers plan vacations that keep carbon emissions to a minimum. As 2011 European Green Capital, the city is showcasing a number of its initiatives and programs -- yet one more reason for environmentally-minded travelers to visit. WHAT TO SEE & DO . To get the best sense of what the city has to offer, head to the waterways. Alster Lake, located in the city center, is a hub for activities. One of the best ways to truly appreciate it is on a rented canoe or peddle boat. Taking a public ferry is a great way to cruise the River Elbe, says Kim Sawford of Sandemans New Europe Tours, a service which connects travelers with local guides in more than a dozen cities in Europe, including Hamburg. ""They come every 15 minutes and take you alongside the harbor, the artificial beaches, stopping off at some little fishing villages just outside the city. It's the best way to see the waterway."" Hamburg boasts an abundant amount of green space. More than 16% of the urban area consists of forest, recreation and green spaces. Stroll around Stadtpark, one of the city's largest parks which hosts open-air concerts during the summer. The city is littered with beautiful old buildings such as the Town Hall, however for a glimpse at Hamburg's future, head to the waterside district of HafenCity. Still under development, the ambitious urban project is being designed as a model for counteracting sprawl and promoting sustainable living. GETTING AROUND . It's easy to explore the city center on foot, and Hamburg's public transport system is renowned for being easy to use and accessible, even for the foreign traveler. But if you want to have more freedom when exploring the city, hop on a bike from the city's StradtRAD network. ""I always recommend using it, it's the best way to see everything and with dedicated bike lanes, you feel very safe,"" says Sawford. Bike stations are located throughout Hamburg and can be rented by registering a credit card. WHERE TO EAT . In a city where being green is simply a way of life for residents, several cafes and restaurants pride themselves on using local produce. And unlike other major cities, eating with an environmentally-friendly approach won't cost you the earth. Locals often head to the Sternschanze district, an alternative area known for its graffiti and street art, to grab a coffee and meet friends. Ottensen is full of young professionals enjoying some down time. When the weather is good, the streets are filled with tourists and residents dining al fresco. Shepard recommends Café LilliSu, for what she says is the best organic coffee and cake in town. Mutterland is known for its German specialties. The deli and café bases its delights on traditional dishes. It offers organic bakery goods and regional cheeses and meats, along with homemade soups and salads. WHERE TO STAY . Outside the city center is The Okotel, a stylish hotel built using environmentally safe products. Windows are triple glazed, ventilation is controlled and even the floors are made from untreated wood. The classical Hotel Atlantic is a favorite for visitors who want the convenience of having the city at their door step. ""It's very glamorous and old-fashioned,"" says Shepard. The hotel prides itself on using eco-friendly cleaning products. ""We buy them in large sizes and refill them ourselves to avoid additional packaging,"" says the hotel's Jannika Eibach. The chef focuses on local products to fill his menu, avoiding unnecessarily long food miles, and employees are offered financial incentives to use public transport.","Hamburg boasts the title of 2011 European Green Capital .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Justin Bieber will not face a felony charge of robbery despite a woman's claim the singer tried to steal her cell phone last month. The Los Angeles County district attorney decided the incident at a miniature golf course on May 12 ""does not warrant felony prosecution,"" according to a document obtained by CNN Thursday. The case will now go to the Los Angeles city attorney to decide if a misdemeanor charge will be filed against Bieber, the ""evaluation worksheet"" released by the prosecutor's office said. A woman filed the robbery complaint against Bieber on May 13, a day after the alleged incident happened and hours after she reported it to the celebrity website TMZ, the document said. Justin Bieber again caught in racial controversy . The accuser told Los Angeles Police Department robbery/homicide detectives that the incident began after she used her iPhone to take a photo of Bieber at the batting cages in the Sherman Oaks Castle Park. She put her phone away in her purse when the singer's bodyguard asked her to not take pictures, she said. Bieber ""then approached and accused her of videotaping him,"" she told police. ""He demanded to see her phone, then reached into her purse and pulled the phone out,"" the document said. Bieber and the woman ""tussled over it for a moment,"" she said. ""I'm not recording, I'll show you,"" she said she told police. After she showed Bieber her phone, he told her: ""Why don't you leave, you're embarrassing your daughter."" Her 13-year-old daughter began to cry, the woman said. The daughter later told investigators she was already crying from the excitement of being near Justin Bieber. None of the nine park employees interviewed by police witnessed ""any kind of physical altercation or tug-of-war,"" the report said. No security cameras were in a position to capture video of the scene. Justin Bieber: 'Don't believe rumors' Bieber posted a series of tweets days after the incident, lamenting all the ""rumors"" he's facing. ""It is hard to defend myself and my privacy every moment of the day ... The truth will set u free,"" he tweeted. A source who's close to Bieber and is familiar with the situation played down the incident. ""Justin was just enjoying hanging out with friends at the batting cage and playing mini-golf,"" the source told CNN. ""This just wasn't a big deal."" ""The woman didn't stand out,"" the source said. ""There were plenty of people taking pictures, some more aggressive than others ... which is totally normal. ... This is another example of someone making an issue where there isn't one."" Bieber egging 'a silly prank,' not a felony, lawyers argue . Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey is still considering if and how to prosecute Bieber for an alleged egging of his neighbor's home in January. Investigators asked for a felony vandalism charge against him when they presented their evidence.","The Los Angeles DA concludes incident ""does not warrant felony prosecution""

"(CNN) -- On NBC's ""Meet the Press"" this past Sunday, I was asked how we can make our schools safer and prevent another massacre like Sandy Hook from happening again. I suggested that if one person in the school had been armed and trained to handle a firearm, it might have prevented or minimized the massacre. ""And I'm not so sure -- and I'm sure I'll get mail for this -- I'm not so sure I wouldn't want one person in a school armed, ready for this kind of thing,"" I said. ""The principal lunged at this guy. The school psychologist lunged at the guy. Has to be someone who's trained. Has to be someone who's responsible."" Well, I sure did get mail. Many people agreed with me and sent me examples of their son or daughter's school that had armed security guards, police officers or school employees on the premises. Many others vehemently disagreed with me, and one dissenter even wrote that the blood of the Connecticut victims was ultimately on the hands of pro-gun rights advocates. To that person I would ask: Suppose the principal at Sandy Hook Elementary who was killed lunging at the gunman was instead holding a firearm and was well trained to use it. Would the result have been different? Or suppose you had been in that school when the killer entered, would you have preferred to be armed? Evidence and common sense suggest yes. In 2007, a gunman entered New Life Church in Colorado Springs and shot and killed two girls. Jeanne Assam, a former police officer stationed as a volunteer security guard at the church, drew her firearm, shot and wounded the gunman before he could kill anyone else. The gunman then killed himself. In 1997, high school student Luke Woodham stabbed his mother to death and then drove to Pearl High School in Pearl, Mississippi, and shot and killed two people. He then got back in his car to drive to Pearl Junior High to continue his killings, but Joel Myrick, the assistant principal, ran to his truck and grabbed his pistol, aimed it at Woodham and made him surrender. These are but a few of many examples that the best deterrent of crime when it is occurring is effective self-defense. And the best self-defense against a gunman has proved to be a firearm. LZ Granderson: Teachers with guns is a crazy idea . And yet, there is a near impenetrable belief among anti-gun activists that guns are the cause of violence and crime. Like Frodo's ring in ""The Lord of The Rings,"" they believe that guns are agencies of corruption and corrupt the souls of whoever touches them. Therefore, more guns must lead to more crime. But the evidence simply doesn't support that. Take the controversial concealed-carry permit issue, for example. In a recent article for The Atlantic magazine, Jeffrey Goldberg, by no means an avowed gun-rights advocate, declared, ""There is no proof to support the idea that concealed-carry permit holders create more violence in society than would otherwise occur; they may, in fact, reduce it."" Goldberg cites evidence from Adam Winkler, a law professor at UCLA, that concealed-carry permit holders actually commit crimes at a lower rate than the general population. The General Accountability Office recently found that the number of concealed weapon permits in America has surged to approximately 8 million. According to anti-gun advocates, such an increase in guns would cause a cause a corresponding increase in gun-related violence or crime. In fact, the opposite is true. The FBI reported this year that violent crime rates in the U.S. are reaching historic lows. This comes in spite of the fact that the federal assault weapons ban expired in 2004. Supporters of the ban (not including anti-gun groups who thought it didn't go far enough in the first place) claimed that gun crime would skyrocket when the ban was lifted. That wasn't true at all. In fact, after the expiration of the ban, The New York Times, whose editorial pages are now awash with calls for more gun restrictions, wrote in early 2005, ""Despite dire predictions that America's streets would be awash in military-style guns, the expiration of the decade-long assault weapons ban in September has not set off a sustained surge in the weapons' sales, gun makers and sellers say. It also has not caused any noticeable increase in gun crime in the past seven months, according to several city police departments."" But let's take the issue one step further and examine places where all guns, regardless of make or type, are outlawed: gun-free zones. Are gun-free zones truly safe from guns? John Lott, economist and gun-rights advocate, has extensively studied mass shootings and reports that, with just one exception, the attack on U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, Arizona, in 2011, every public shooting since 1950 in the U.S. in which more than three people have been killed has taken place where citizens are not allowed to carry guns. The massacres at Sandy Hook Elementary, Columbine, Virginia Tech and the Century 16 movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, all took place in gun-free zones. Do you own a gun that fell under the now-expired federal weapons ban? These murderers, while deranged and deeply disturbed, are not dumb. They shoot up schools, universities, malls and public places where their victims cannot shoot back. Perhaps ""gun-free zones"" would be better named ""defenseless victim zones."" To illustrate the absurdity of gun-free zones, Goldberg dug up the advice that gun-free universities offer to its students should a gunman open fire on campus. West Virginia University tells students to ""act with physical aggression and throw items at the active shooter."" These items could include ""student desks, keys, shoes, belts, books, cell phones, iPods, book bags, laptops, pens, pencils, etc."" Such ""higher education"" would be laughable if it weren't true and funded by taxpayer dollars. Eliminating or restricting firearms for public self-defense doesn't make our citizens safer; it makes them targets. If we're going to have a national debate about guns, it should be acknowledged that guns, in the hands of qualified and trained individuals subject to background checks, prevent crime and improve public safety. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","William Bennett: Arming, training one person in a school could help prevent shootings .

"(CNN) -- China launched a second satellite for the Venezuelan government Saturday, state media reported, days before President Hugo Chavez runs for re-election. The observation satellite named Miranda launched from the northwestern Chinese province of Gansu. It is Venezuela's second satellite in orbit, according to the Venezuela State News Agency, AVN. The first one -- a telecommunications satellite -- was launched by China in 2008. It is named after Venezuelan independence hero, Simon Bolivar, the news agency said. President Hugo Chavez, along with cabinet members and the Chinese ambassador to Venezuela, watched the latest launch from his palace in Caracas. Hours before it launched, Chavez showed up at a plaza in the heart of the capital, surprising a crowd gathered to watch the satellite on giant public screens. ""We are watching history, the rebirth of history,"" the president said. The Venezuelan leader said the satellite ""is part of the scientific and technological development"" of the nation. It will fly over Venezuela three times a day and take 350 high resolution images daily using four cameras, according to the news agency. Venezuela will use it to monitor the country, urban planning, military operations, and to combat illegal mining and illegal crops, according to the news agency. Miranda -- named after independence leader Francisco de Miranda -- was launched days before presidential elections set for October 7. Campaigns between the president and his opponent, former governor Henrique Capriles, have heated up in the final stretch.","The observation satellite launches from northwestern China .

"New York (CNN) -- As an 8 a.m. ferry made its final maneuvers across the Hudson River, Ashley Furman clutched her hand-bag and made small talk with other commuters. Then it all went black. When she woke up, the 26-year-old New Jersey native was in pain and on the floor with the wind knocked out of her, about six feet from where she had been standing. ""It felt like an elephant landed on me,"" she said. The high-speed ferry that serves as Furman's normal commute slammed into a Lower Manhattan pier near Wall Street around 8:45 a.m. Wednesday. Scores were left bloodied and writhing in agony as emergency crews rushed to the scene. ""Once I was able to catch my breath, I got up and it was very scary,"" Furman said. Packed with 326 passengers and five crew members, the vessel tossed people like rag dolls as it slammed to a halt, flinging those aboard into the air and against walls, seats and windows, according to several witnesses. ""I saw a lot of bleeding heads with white bandages (and) a lot of people strapped to boards,"" said passerby Julie Westfall. ""It felt like we were in a car crash,"" said passenger Elizabeth Banta, who watched in horror as medical personnel began triage on at least 85 injured people. Two were initially listed in critical condition as emergency crews rushed the wounded on stretchers to hospitals. But by Wednesday evening, authorities said only one person's condition remained critical. It was not immediately clear what caused the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board deployed a team to the scene and planned to more fully undertake their investigation on Thursday. As the vessel approached Manhattan's Pier 11, witnesses said, unsuspecting commuters had gotten up from their seats and packed closer to the ferry exits and atop stairwells -- a typical occurrence at the end of their 40-minute commute. But the perches may have magnified the effects of the crash, as passengers careened down stairwells and against windows. ""We know that they hit the pier at a relatively high rate of speed,"" said U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Gordon Loebl, who estimated that the boat had been traveling at about 14 knots, or 16 mph. Furman said the vessel seemed to be ""going pretty fast for a boat that was supposed to be docking."" After the crash, the front of the ship bore a large gash. The ferry, privately operated by Seastreak, provides daily service between Atlantic Highlands and Highlands in New Jersey to piers in Lower Manhattan. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with those that were injured,"" Seastreak LLC said in a written statement, adding that it would work with authorities to determine the cause. Thirty-one people were transported to New York's Bellevue Hospital. Of those, all were considered non-critical and were expected to be released Wednesday. This is not the first time this vessel has been involved in a crash. Coast Guard records indicate that the same Seastreak ferry in 2009 slammed into a New Jersey dock and tore a 2- to 3-foot gash in the starboard bow of the vessel. A year later, a collision with a dock pile punctured a hole in the port side of the same boat. Wednesday's crash also drew comparisons to an unrelated 2010 incident when a ferry with mechanical problems crashed into the Staten Island Ferry terminal, injuring 36 people. That ferry was the same vessel involved in an October 2003 crash that killed 11 people and injured 42, considered one of the worst ferry accidents in New York's recent history. CNN's Chris Boyette, Alison Kosik and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","NEW: The U.S. Coast Guard says 85 people were injured in the crash, 1 critically .

"(CNN) -- I lost a friend and mentor today. Maya Angelou was the voice of three generations. Her poetry spanned our journey, chronicled our hearts and documented our struggles as we moved from the orations of Martin Luther King to the presidency of Barack Obama. ""Dr."" Maya Angelou was a phenomenal woman. A rousing spirit, a joyful soul. A remarkable and gifted writer, a trailblazer, an activist, a mother. A hero. She was a woman who cooked up greens that could move you to dance. And yes, she danced, she loved to move. And she moved us all. She loved her black skin and her hair. Growing up in the South, I learned to love my own skin and hair just as she taught us to. But Maya was not stuck on color or gender or religion or sexual orientation. She was fixated on humanity and helping to bring love and kindness into this world. That's perhaps what I cherish about her the most: Like every great artist, she emerged from deep and sorrowful struggle to reveal a beautiful, confident, calm and wise soul. She used that struggle to transform herself and made us believe that we, too, could transform ourselves as well. Like the incredible tall oak trees of her beloved Arkansas, she was rooted in culture, grounded in the goodness of this earth and her amazing gift of poetry. She had a talent for weaving words into songs and songs into melodies. She wasn't afraid to sway her hips. And she inspired us to do the same. Opinion: How Maya Angelou gave me life . Maya, we didn't tire of you. I can still hear those words she spoke on that chilly day, at the first inauguration of her fellow Arkansan, William Jefferson Clinton. Her poem, ""On the Pulse of Morning,"" is too long for me to quote in its entirety here, but I urge you, for your own sake, go read it. Here are a few of its lines: . The Rock cries out today, you may stand on me, . But do not hide your face. Across the wall of the world, . A River sings a beautiful song. It says, . Come rest here by my side. ... Come, . Clad in peace and I will sing the songs . The Creator gave to me when I and the . Tree and the rock were one. Maya Angelou also had a playful side. Like any good friend, she enjoyed the company of people. Once, my friend Minyon Moore hosted a luncheon in honor of Betty Shabazz, Cicely Tyson, Coretta Scott King and Maya Angelou. It was a moment for us, the up-and-coming, to meet our heroes, to sit at their feet and learn from them. Before we could break bread (cornbread), Maya had everyone laughing. She was a gifted storyteller and her warmth filled up many empty hearts. She made a place for so many folks in her life, in her kitchen or on her stage. Maya was born wise and when she talked, you could hear the ancient wisdom of our ancestors. She carried that warrior spirit from Africa. Maya Angelou remembered by those she inspired . I grew up with her poems and stories. They inspired me, they encouraged me, they taught me. I still have the paperback copies of her books I bought when I was a girl. I often wondered when I read one of her poems or stories for the first time, how does she know me? How does she understand so well who I am, what I'm going through, what questions and doubts, and triumphs and joys, I experience? But that, of course, is what a great poet does. She speaks for herself, but she speaks for us all. And the amazing thing about Maya Angelou was that, although she was a black woman, her poems touched the souls of all Americans. For instance, what immigrant or child of immigrants, what Holocaust survivor or child of a survivor, what adolescent or mother of an adolescent does not recognize his or her own history in the justly famous, ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings""? Maya Angelou: Some of her most powerful speeches . Let her rest now. Rest with Malcolm and Betty, with Coretta and Martin and Dorothy Height, with James Baldwin and Langston Hughes. Let her dance with James Brown, Michael Jackson, and rejoice with Mahalia Jackson. Most of all, let her smile and be at peace with Mandela. I will honor her today by rereading some of her poems and stories. I urge you to do the same. She gave us the gift of her words and we should treasure them. She was phenomenal, someone I loved and will forever cherish. So, thank you Maya. A phenomenal woman.

"(CNN) -- Civil rights leaders met with retail chain representatives and agreed to create a customer bill of rights -- to be posted in department stores in the coming days -- in response to allegations of racial profiling in multiple retail chains. The one-page document is also expected to be posted to the department store websites, which will include Macy's, Barneys New York, Bloomingdales, Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue, according to a press conference on Monday. ""Profiling is an unacceptable practice and will not be tolerated,"" the document states, drafted by the Retail Council of New York State, along with National Action Network and Reverend Al Sharpton. The groups first met on November 20 after several black shoppers alleged they were racially profiled at Macy's and Barneys New York earlier this year. ""Employees who violate the company's prohibition on profiling will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment,"" the document says. In addition to prohibiting racial profiling, the customers' bill of rights also prohibits ""the use of excessive force or using threatening, vulgar language when apprehending or detaining suspects."" ""We are cooperating with the groups we have formed and we are going to continue to cooperate and we look forward to welcoming everybody as a customer of Macy's,"" Macy's Vice President of Government Affairs Edward Goldberg told a news conference after Monday's meeting. ""I think it's a good idea to have a bill of rights because then that way you can defend yourself and have backup,"" department store shopper Carla Ellis told CNN affiliate WABC. ""I'll believe it when I see it,"" said another shopper, Rodney Jennings. HBO television actor Robert Brown filed a lawsuit in November against the New York Police Department and Macy's Inc., accusing them of racially profiling him, according to court documents. Brown was the fourth person to say they were targeted after shopping at a New York department store because of race this year, and the second to accuse Macy's of racial profiling. The other two said they were racially profiled at Barneys New York.","Macy's and Barneys New York among stores to post ""Bill of Rights""

"(CNN) -- With its iconic Harbour Bridge and world-famous Opera House, Sydney is easily Australia's most recognizable city. It's also a hot property market. The country's low interest and mortgage rates have driven sales of affordable middle income housing in recent years. But with demand so high there is barely enough stock to satisfy hungry homebuyers. Now one company believes they have the solution that will both save space and keep city living cost effective -- shipping containers. From its base in the town of Lismore, The Container Build Group is transforming the durable metal boxes into comfy homes that will eventually be transported to locations across Australia. According to Jamie Van Tongeren, the company's CEO, the concept provides a clean and productive way to provide affordable urban housing. Shipping containers as homes have already appeared in various guises in the likes of the Netherlands, the UK, Sweden, the U.S. and South Africa. ""I started the business because I thought there was a need for affordable housing and a cleaner and greener option,"" Van Tongeren said. ""I'd seen (containers being used) overseas and I think it's something that needs to be done and I'm doing it."" So far, business for Van Tongeren has been brisk. Annual turnover last year was over $1.5 million dollars and the company expects to double that going forward. From $565 per square meter ($52 per sq ft) to $1,400 per square meter ($130 per sq ft), the cost of construction and overall sale price is lower than a brick building. According to Van Tongeren, there are environmental and construction advantages as well. ""The ecological advantages of building with a container is the recycling of a container ... we try to use as many eco-friendly products as possible including solar composting toilets,"" he said. ""There's virtually no on-site work to build it so there is less use of tradesmen going to site and there's a lot of savings for the client like scaffolding, safety fences, portaloos all that stuff that you need to construct on site."" Given the time saved by excluding these processes, a house can be built from scratch in as little as three weeks. Windows are cut out, containers are welded together and stacked on top of each other to provide multiple floors and rooms while insulation panels are installed to contain heat. Clients can also personalize the design to give their new abode a bespoke feel. Many still doubt whether people will want to live in recycled steel boxes, but with more than 34 million shipping containers either in use or lying dormant around the world, an increasing number of architects are aware of the possibilities they provide.","Australian company is building homes out of disused shipping containers .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Katherine Jackson will share guardianship of Michael Jackson's three children with TJ Jackson under an agreement that is supported by the oldest son, Prince, her lawyer said. TJ Jackson, the 34-year-old son of Tito Jackson, will ""take joint legal responsibility for certain day-to-day duties such as the management of household personnel, including security,"" attorney Perry Sanders said Friday. ""Mrs. Jackson is extremely pleased with the prospect of enjoying the pleasure of raising Michael's children without the day-to-day tedium of items such as managing the large staff that goes with such a high profile family and focus her attention on being a grandmother and raising Michael's children,"" Sanders said. Katherine Jackson suspended as guardian of Michael Jackson's children . TJ Jackson has been close to the children much of their lives and was left in charge of them in the past when Katherine Jackson was away. ""Mrs. Jackson and TJ have often shared responsibilities of raising the children since Michael Jackson's tragic passing,"" Sanders said. The agreement comes two days after the Los Angeles judge overseeing the probate of Michael Jackson's estate named TJ Jackson to be the temporary guardian because Katherine Jackson might have been ""prevented from acting as a guardian because of the acts of third parties."" TJ Jackson's petition to be permanent guardian that was filed Friday will be amended next week asking the judge to make Katherine Jackson and her grandson TJ co-guardians of Prince, 15; Paris, 14; and Prince Michael II, 10, who's also known as Blanket. The 82-year-old Jackson family matriarch returned to her Calabasas, California, home early Thursday after 10 days away. Her business manager, lawyer and the children said they thought she was traveling to a Jackson concert in Albuquerque, New Mexico, but she never arrived. A missing person report was filed six days later, but she was later found to be at an Arizona spa with several of her sons and daughters. The missing person report triggered a media storm, with Paris Jackson tweeting for people to help find her grandmother or at least to get a phone call from her. Prince Jackson was involved in the ""very productive meeting"" with Katherine Jackson, her lawyer, TJ Jackson and his lawyer Thursday evening that resulted in the deal, Sanders said. ""Following reaching agreement, Margaret Lodise, the court-appointed guardian ad litem for the children, was brought into the meeting by conference call,"" he said. ""Ms. Lodise confirmed with Prince that the agreement reflected the wishes of all the children. "" Katherine Jackson ""greatly appreciates the recent love and concern that supporters have shown for her and the kids, and she hopes the court will grant this request for co-guardianship,"" Sanders said. ""She is eager to simply enjoy her great relationship with these children, while deeding over some of the stressors that go hand-in-hand with being a guardian."" Jackson family drama an unwanted reality show . She even found humor in some of the speculation about her health that emerged in the past week, Sanders told CNN after the meeting last night. ""I am pleased to report that she is fine and she laughed at the widely publicized report that she had suffered a stroke."" A letter signed by several of her children, including Janet, Jermaine, Randy and Rebbie Jackson, accused executors of her estate of abusing her and referred to a ""mini-stroke,"" which her lawyer said never happened. Those four Jacksons teamed up to take their mother to a spa near Tucson, Arizona, on July 15, later saying it was under a doctor's orders. Hours after his grandmother's return, Prince criticized his famous aunts and uncles on Twitter, saying they had taken his grandmother away and kept her out of touch for 10 days. ""I'm really angry and hurt,"" he tweeted. ""Although I am happy my grandma was returned, after speaking with her I realized how misguided and how badly she was lied to,"" Prince tweeted. Prince Jackson blasts aunts, uncles over grandmother's treatment . His Twitter posts included a photo of his cell phone screen, which he said showed ""a group chat I had started to several family members. This group text message I had started was replied to but they didn't know that I could see the responses. For this whole time, they denied us contact to our grandmother."" The image appeared to show Prince sending a text to aunts Rebbie and Janet Jackson: ""This is enough so I am texting you for the simple fact that WE DEMAND TO SPEAK TO MY GRANDMA NOW!!!"" The reply, apparently from Janet Jackson, was: ""Don't let them pls."" The text exchange came three hours after Janet Jackson was seen on security camera video apparently attempting to take Paris Jackson's cell phone away in the driveway of Katherine Jackson's home. Janet Jackson's representative did not immediately reply to CNN's request for comment. Prince's Twitter posting referred to words of caution from his father. ""As long as I can remember my dad had repeatedly warned me of certain people and their ways,"" he tweeted. The tweet concluded, ""If you continue with your lies I will continue with the truth."" It was signed ""Michael Jackson Jr."" The tweets mysteriously disappeared several hours later, replaced with a message disavowing them. That message subsequently vanished and was replaced by another saying Prince didn't know if his account had been ""hacked."" He then reposted the original message about his grandmother and the image of the text exchange. Before Katherine Jackson began the long drive back to California on Wednesday, she appeared on camera and read a statement to ABC News. As her children Rebbie, Jermaine and Janet stood behind her, she read from a yellow notepad: . ""I am devastated that while I've been away ... my grandchildren have been taken away from me, and I'm coming home to see about that,"" Jackson said.

"(CNN) -- A just-released report from the Institute of Medicine and National Research Council is making news by clearly illustrating that Americans have ""shorter lives and poorer health."" This is somewhat shocking, given how much we spend on health care each year â€” more than any of the 16 other rich countries surveyed in the study. What's even more upsetting is that this report focused quite heavily on people who are young. In the United States, even that group fared poorly. Why is this? Some of the reasons involve choices make at a personal level. We eat too much, abuse drugs too often, wear seat belts too rarely and commit violence against each other to often. Systemic issues are also to blame. We have higher levels of poverty than comparable countries, and our safety net programs are less capable of catching people when they fall. And too many also have too much trouble accessing the health care system, resulting in inefficient, ineffective and often absent care. It's far too easy to let these dreadful statistics become obscured in a politically charged argument. Let's avoid that. This report is so stark that it's going to take a concerted effort on the part of the government, the media, the health care system and everyday citizens to turn things around. Our personal choices are bad. Our safety nets are bad. Our health care system is bad. It's all bad. How bad? When compared with peer countries, the United States was the absolute worst with respect to still births, infant mortality and low birth weight. Some have tried to blame this on ""coding"" differences. In other words, they will claim that other countries will refuse to define a premature birth as we do, resulting in artificially high numbers in the United States. But when this report recalculated the rates to exclude such births equally in all countries, we still ranked last. Things don't get better after birth. The chance that a child in the United States will die before age 5 is higher than in any of the other 16 peer countries. Injuries are the most common cause of death, but the United States also has the highest rate of deaths caused by negligence or abuse. And violence is decidedly an American problem. Homicide is the third most common cause of death in children age 1-4. From age 5-19, the trend continues. Kids this age in the United States have the worst health ranking of the 17 studied countries. More than one-third of U.S. children age 5-17 are obese or overweight, the highest of any peer country. The adolescent pregnancy rate in the United States is about 3.5 times the average of others. Additionally, the rates of sexually transmitted infections, including syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia are the worst compared to peer countries. Nor are these children exempt from death. Injury deaths are more common in 15- to 19-year-olds in the United States than in any other studied country. Homicide claims the second highest number of lives in 15- to -24-year-olds, and 4 in 5 of those deaths involve guns. Males between the ages of 15 and 19 are five times as likely to die from violence in the United States than in other countries. Even as young adults, ages 25-34, mortality remains consistently upsetting and preventable. Unintentional injuries remain the No. 1 cause of death. The risk of dying by violence remains seven times higher for males in the United States ages 20-24 than in other countries. We have to work together to make these numbers better. Some of them can be improved with public health measures. We need to help Americans be less obese, to have fewer accidents and to commit less violence. There are lots of local studies and initiatives that propose ways to fix these things, but our public health system is woefully underfunded, and translating any promising findings to meaningful societal change poses a huge challenge. We also need to improve our safety nets to help children at the lowest end of the socioeconomic ladder do better, even before they are born. Pregnant women, babies and children suffer from hunger and malnutrition far too often in the richest country in the world. Yet we still debate the merits of the federally funded WIC (Womens, Infants and Children) program, school lunches and food assistance to needy families. Finally, we need to find a way to improve access to the health care system. The Medicaid program covers one in every three births and one in every three children in the United States, and it's still not enough. As some states balk at expanding Medicaid to cover many of the poorest uninsured, some are still talking about reducing funding to the already stretched program. There's no question that we have the capability, the knowledge and the resources to care for people. It's just a matter of doing it better. There will be some who deny these results. Others will try to use them for political gain. That would be a mistake. We have to accept these findings and begin to work holistically to improve them. Being last just isn't the American way.

"(CNN) -- Less than two weeks after she was brutally stabbed, a 12-year-old Wisconsin girl is home recuperating and feeling well enough to tease her younger brother, her family says. ""Her physical wounds, thankfully, are healing more quickly than anticipated and her pain is decreasing daily,"" the family said in a statement. ""For that, we are so grateful."" The family has designated Tuesday as ""Go Purple"" day. It's the survivor's favorite color and the family is asking supporters to wear it. The family has asked that the victim not be named for her safety and because she is a minor. Purple is also part of the theme of the official #HeartsForHealing fundraiser for the victim and her family. The campaign has raised more than $42,000 toward its goal of $250,000, and has also resulted in an outpouring of homemade purple hearts to be delivered to the girl and her family. ""The messages that people are including in their hearts, the time and effort that they're putting into some of these projects, it was absolutely incredible,"" Dana Hoffman, a family friend and spokeswoman and one of the organizers of the Hearts for Healing campaign, told CNN's ""New Day."" The girl's family said it is ""overwhelmed by the outpouring of love from the surrounding community, across the country, and even overseas."" The attack . The ordeal began May 31 when the girl went into the woods near her home in Waukesha to play hide-and-seek with two of her friends. Authorities said one girl held the victim down while another stabbed her 19 times, allegedly so that the attackers could impress a fictitious character called Slenderman that often appears in horror stories, videos and images. Who is Slenderman? One of the girls encountered the name on a website known as Creepypasta Wiki. One of the suspects told police that Slenderman is the site's supposed leader, and to climb into his realm, a user must kill someone. A bicyclist found the wounded girl alive. The suspects, Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, were arrested hours later, according to a criminal complaint. They are charged with attempted first-degree intentional homicide. The 12-year-olds are being charged as adults, and bail is set at $500,000 for each, Waukesha County District Attorney Brad Schimel said. The recovery . The victim is sleeping better at night, her family said. But she gets tired and overwhelmed easily. ""Since coming home, our daughter has enjoyed spending time outside and getting fresh air as well as running a few quick errands with her mom,"" the statement said. ""She spent time watching many episodes of 'Full House' alongside her 'guard pets', which consist of a family dog and two cats. Like any older sister, she has also managed to continue teasing her younger brother."" The family has had a few conversations about what happened that day, Hoffman said, mostly focused on how the girl found the strength to crawl out of the woods where she was attacked and seek help.

"TBILISI, Georgia (CNN)  -- The number of people displaced by the warfare in Georgia is approaching 100,000 and the figure could rise, the U.N. refugee agency said Monday. Thousands of people have been displaced by the worsening conflict in the region. International agencies and nations were working to help thousands of people fleeing violence in war-ravaged Georgia, where 275,000 previously displaced people, refugees, stateless people and returnees had been living even before hostilities broke out last week between Georgia and Russia. ""It's a very fluid situation,"" said Ron Redmond, a spokesman for the U.N. high commissioner for refugees. Georgia proper is a particular problem because some of the people who fled to Gori in Georgia from South Ossetia when the conflict began found themselves in a conflict zone and had to go somewhere else. The numbers Redmond cited were as of Sunday. He said about 56,000 people have fled in and around Gori. Many displaced people are headed to Tbilisi, where people are staying with relatives and acquaintances or at facilities available for the displaced.  Watch U.S. and Russia clash » . The UNHCR said in a written statement that Georgian officials believe ""a few thousand have fled south into Georgia proper from South Ossetia, but a registration must be carried out to get an exact figure."" When UNHCR and World Food Program officials traveled to Gori on Sunday, they determined about 80 percent of residents had left the city, which appeared largely deserted. About 30,000 people from South Ossetia headed to North Ossetia in Russia, Redmond said, citing Russian numbers. He said many women and children are showing up without husbands and fathers, indicating many families have been separated. Many of the uprooted are ""extremely distressed,"" he said. They are staying in schools and other public buildings. Those in schools will have to leave by September and ""there's some concern about where they are going to."" ""It's assumed that many will probably go back"" to South Ossetia, Redmond said. At the same time, he said, ""There's been heavy destruction. Many may not have anything to go back to."" Redmond said more displacement is possible because hostilities are continuing in the area. The World Food Program is providing food assistance to displaced people. It said the aid work is perilous because of what the agency says are ""continuing Russian air raids."" Over the weekend, the agency ""provided a 10-day food ration to more than 1,900 displaced people living in shelters"" in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, and said more distributions were taking place Monday. ""The number of people in need of our help is rising by the hour,"" said Lola Castro, director of the WFP for Georgia. She said around 2,750 displaced people had been registered in Tbilisi, and others ""were living with relatives or in unofficial shelters."" UNHCR is working to help civilians fleeing the war zone in and near the disputed region of South Ossetia, where Russian and Georgian troops have been fighting, and is providing humanitarian relief. Over the weekend, the UNHCR and associates passed along aid to ""300 vulnerable Georgians from South Ossetia who had been transferred from Gori to Tbilisi."" ""The agency also provided tents and other supplies to partners in Gori for use by the displaced, if necessary,"" the UNHCR said. The UNHCR said it is starting an ""emergency airlift of relief supplies to bolster its stockpiles of humanitarian aid in the Caucasus region."" High Commissioner Antonio Guterres authorized $2 million from UNHCR's emergency reserve for ""possible immediate new needs in the region"" and said more staff is being deployed. The first airlift flight is to tote 20,000 blankets and other aid items from UNHCR's central emergency stockpile in Dubai to Georgia overnight Monday. Another flight is planned for Wednesday from Copenhagen, Denmark. There will be humanitarian supplies for up to 30,000 people in both flights. The UNHCR is planning to provide ""basic non-food aid items and temporary shelter where required, and has already activated the replenishment of stocks from its central emergency stockpile."" ""Our main concern as the U.N. refugee agency is with the safety of the civilians, both displaced and non-displaced, and with humanitarian access with the possibility for us to help those in distress, especially the uprooted,"" said Antonio Guterres, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees. ""We have mobilized our financial resources and our humanitarian resources. Airlifts are starting with relief items to be able to help people. But we need to be able to get to them."" Guterres said he was pleased with the news that ""humanitarian corridors"" will be established and said UNHCR is ""ready to provide immediate humanitarian support to Georgian or Russian authorities."" Both Russia and Georgia mentioned plans for such corridors -- one to North Ossetia in Russia and one to Georgia. The ICRC said a surgical team will be arriving in Georgia on Tuesday ""to reinforce local surgical staff, in particular those working at Gori's civilian hospital. The Norwegian Red Cross is sending a field hospital to help treat people who have been wounded in Georgia."" That would include those in the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali. ""Over the past few days the ICRC has been able to visit hospitals in Alaguir, Ardon and Vladikavkaz, in the Russian Federation, and in Gori, Poti and Senaki in Georgia,"" said Dominik Stillhart, the organization's deputy director of operations. ""It's still too early to say how many people have been killed or injured by the fighting, but our visits to these hospitals confirm that local medical facilities are dealing with a large number of wounded and dead."" The ICRC is hoping to distribute blankets, hygiene materials and cooking pots, and restore access to drinking water in Tskhinvali. The group plans to work with the Russian Red Cross in North Ossetia and provide emergency aid for families. The group is preparing to airlift 15 tons of medicines and medical supplies to treat injured people. The ICRC plans to send material ""for a water-treatment plant and distribution tanks capable of holding safe drinking water for around 20,000 people.""

"(CNN) -- Formula One is supposed to be about drivers racing fast cars, but this season it seems to be all about the tires. There have been complaints from teams and drivers, with an official investigation also underway over a development test, while the latest twist involves Pirelli putting its plan on hold to introduce new race tires at next month's Canadian Grand Prix. Instead, each of the 22 drivers will be given two sets of development medium compound tires to try out during the first practice session at the Gilles Villeneuve Circuit in Montreal on 7 June. A statement by the Italian manufacturer explained: ""The Formula One teams will have an opportunity to test the new range of Pirelli tires during free practice at the Canadian Grand Prix, while the tires used for the actual race will remain in their original 2013 specification. ""Following feedback from the teams and drivers, the new specification of tire is then set to be introduced from the British Grand Prix at the end of June, and will remain in place until the end of the year."" Often dismissed by the sport's protagonists as the ""black things in the corners,"" those spheres of rubber have very much moved to F1's center stage. After the last race in Monaco, it emerged that Mercedes, who won the race thanks to Nico Rosberg, faced an official investigation over whether it carried out an illegal tire test. The German team, who are based in Oxfordshire, England, helped Pirelli carry out a three-day tire test in Barcelona immediately after the Spanish Grand Prix but controversially the team used race drivers Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton and their 2013 car. In May, Pirelli had asked the sport's ruling body -- the FIA -- if it could carry out testing with an F1 team. The sport's rules state that 1,000 kilometers of testing with any marque is allowed during the season -- as long as every team is offered that opportunity. But rival teams Red Bull and Ferrari protested to the FIA, arguing the Barcelona test contravened the rule banning in-season testing. The FIA is now investigating the matter but neither the governing body or Pirelli expect a resolution before the Canadian GP. Even prior to Monaco, tires had already been drawing plenty of heat. Red Bull and their triple world champion Sebastian Vettel complained the 2013 rubber meant they could not push the car to the limits of its top-speed because the tires had to be so carefully managed. There were further criticisms after the Spanish Grand Prix was won by Ferrari's Fernando Alonso on a four-stop strategy. Like Spain, the race on Canada's temporary race circuit, which combines high-speed straights and slow corners, could well see teams make multiple pit-stops. There were also more serious safety concerns following a spate of delaminations -- where the tire layers separate -- which affected Hamilton, Felipe Massa and Paul di Resta's cars. Pirelli wants to introduce new tires that are not prone to dangerous delaminations as quickly as possible. The Italian company is also aware it must protect its image both for its road car clientele and also as it hopes to sign a new deal to continue as F1's official tire supplier. ""The aim of introducing the new tire is to prevent any instances of the tread detaching itself from the structure,"" the Pirelli statement continued. ""However, the performance and wear characteristics of the new tire will not be significantly different, with the aim of keeping up the spectacle and retaining a strategic element to all the races."" In theory, the FIA does not interfere with decisions on tires. ""We only step in on safety concerns.,"" an FIA spokesman told CNN: ""For us safety is paramount. ""When they decide to bring a new tire, it is normally given to everybody. The tire has to be the same for everybody... it is evaluated afterwards."" But with Mercedes facing an official investigation over its involvement in testing, the subject of tires has become an issue where everyone in F1 must now tread carefully.","Pirelli put plans to introduce new race tires at next month's Canadian Grand Prix on hold .

"(CNN) -- The European financial crisis is poorly understood in the United States. Because so many Americans misunderstand the crisis, they fail to appreciate how -- and how much -- the crisis threatens them. Americans tend to think (and are encouraged by politicians to think) of the European crisis as a debt crisis. Governments overspent, got into debt, and now the day of reckoning is at hand. Yet that version of the case is demonstrably untrue. Spain's debt-to-GDP ratio is substantially lower than that of the United States. Germany's debt-to-GDP ratio is neck and neck with the United States. Yet it is Spain, not Germany, that is in trouble. Europe is not having a debt crisis. It is having a currency crisis. It's not that European countries have bumped up against their ability to borrow. The problem is that some European countries are bumping up against their ability to borrow in euros. That limit is imposed not by markets, but by the European Central Bank. Nobody doubts that the U.S. can generate dollars to pay its bills. Nobody doubts that Japan can generate yen, or that Britain can generate pounds sterling. But they do doubt that Spain or Italy can generate the euros they need, because -- unlike the U.S. or Japan or Britain -- Spain and Italy lack the power to create their own money. Maybe not Greece, which is a special case, but the other troubled countries could recover their borrowing ability tomorrow if they quit the euro and resumed their former national currencies. Americans need to understand this truth, because otherwise they will be blindsided by the real risks out there. The hard-pressed countries of the eurozone have an escape hatch: They can quit the euro currency. Quitting the euro would not be pain-free -- but it might well become a less painful alternative to what those countries are suffering now: Great Depression levels of unemployment, rising taxes, massive social security cutbacks. Over the past two years, for example, Portugal has cut government spending by almost 8 points of GDP. To achieve the same scale of cut in the United States, we'd have to abolish both Social Security and Medicare. The sacrifices countries make to stay inside the eurozone fall mostly on their own people. But if they quit, the pain is exported -- and will be heading our way. Consider for example a working Spaniard, earning, say, 40,000 euros a year and holding a 2,000 euro balance on his credit card. Spain quits the euro. The Spaniard's salary is converted from 40,000 euros to 40,000 new pesetas. Quickly, the new peseta loses value against the euro. A month after the conversion date, the Spaniard's 40,000 new pesetas are worth only 20,000 euros. He is poorer than he was. But at least he's working. At Spain's new lower wages, other Spaniards quickly find work too, just as Americans rapidly went to work when the U.S. quit the gold standard in 1934. Imported goods become more expensive. But not rents -- they are denominated in new pesetas too. When our Spaniard buys his morning cup of coffee, the beans will be more expensive and the sugar too. The wages of the barista who makes the coffee, however, will have declined in tandem with his own. Ditto the mortgage on the coffee shop. And those nontraded inputs account for most of the cost of the cup. Now look at the other side of the ledger, the Spaniard's debt. What happens to that 2,000 balance on his credit card? It is (presumably) also redenominated into new pesetas. It also falls in value, to just 1,000 euros. Good news for the Spaniard. Bad news for the credit card company. Or is it? In the 2000s, Spanish banks emulated U.S. banks in the aggressive use of securitization. As of 2010, the European Central Bank reports, Spanish banks had issued more asset-backed securities than the banks of any other European country except the Netherlands -- and vastly more than the banks of France and Germany combined. Which means that our Spaniard's credit-card debt is probably not owed to the company that issued his credit card. That debt is owed to some other financial institution, somewhere else on earth. Where? Who knows? Even the people who own the debt may not know. As we learned during the subprime mortgage crash, bad loans get sliced and diced, recombined and repackaged, into bonds whose contents are not always understood by the pension funds and insurance companies that buy them. Those bond buyers often only discovered that they had bought bonds based on subprime mortgages after the mortgages failed. Financial institutions that have bought Spanish credit-card debt (or Spanish mortgages or whatever) may discover equally shockingly late that their bonds also will not and cannot pay off in full. Think of those potentially redenominated Spanish bonds as toxic admixtures into bond portfolios all over the planet -- including possibly the bond portfolio that supports your pension or your life insurance claim. And then understand why all this talk of ""We could be like Greece"" so radically misses the point. We're in the same boat already with the Spaniards and the Italians and, to a much lesser degree, the Greeks -- and not because of the way the U.S. government taxes and spends, but because of the way world financial institutions borrow and lend. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum says the European financial crisis is not about debt, it's about currency .
He says some countries unable to borrow in euros with limits set by European Central Bank .
Their escape hatch: Quit the euro. Ensuing credit-card debt could have global effect .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- It was somewhere in the middle of Six Flags' Goliath roller coaster that my eye started to short-circuit, nearly going black. The towering roller coaster pressed my fellow riders and me deep into our seats as we rounded a set of sharp curves. Many find the ride thrilling; for me it was unnerving. I spent much of my time in line for the next ride of the day, the Batman roller coaster, reading about the potential for roller coaster deaths and accidents. This was Friday in Georgia, the same day a woman died after falling from her seat on a Six Flags coaster in Texas. Pecking through roller coaster news on my phone that day, before the death in Texas had been reported, I learned, among other things, that it was reported that a 45-year-old died after passing out and having an apparent heart attack on Goliath, the ride that made my eye briefly malfunction. I get that this seems paranoid, and I knew reading this information while waiting in line for a roller coaster was an unnecessary form of self-torture. But I couldn't help it. There's something about a roller coaster death that is uniquely terrifying in a screenplay kind of way. It's summer fun gone horribly wrong. I think this is partly why so many are shocked and saddened by the death of Rosy Esparza, who fell, according to a witness who spoke with CNN affiliate WFAA, from the Texas Giant roller coaster at Six Flags in Arlington, Texas. The exact cause remains unknown, but authorities say there was no sign of ""foul play or criminality."" Six Flags said in a statement that safety is paramount. ""Since the safety of our guests and employees is our number one priority, the ride has been closed pending further investigation,"" the park said. A park spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment on its safety inspection policies and the calls for federal oversight. Still, it's a reluctant thrill seeker's greatest fear. It's almost impossible to imagine how terrifying the experience would be -- and how family members and fellow riders could process such an accident. After Esparza's death, Sen. Ed Markey, the Democrat from Massachusetts who recently took the seat vacated by John Kerry, has reportedly renewed his call for federal oversight of roller coaster inspection. ""No federal agency has legal authority to enforce safety standards,"" NBC wrote in a post about the safety issues. ""And Texas is one of at least 17 states that have no agency responsible for inspecting amusement park rides, according to NBC News' survey of state codes in all 50 states."" Markey wants a federal agency to oversee safety enforcement. The Consumer Product Safety Commission regulates mobile amusement park rides, like those found at fairs, but does not have jurisdiction over ""fixed"" rides like those at Six Flags, said Scott Wolfson, a spokesman for the federal agency. The difference makes little sense, and Markey isn't alone in his call for more oversight. Tracy Mehan, from the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, said that relatively little is known about the prevalence of roller coaster injuries and deaths because the federal government doesn't enforce safety inspections and investigations. A patchwork of state laws govern the process, she said. Would-be roller coaster regulators have been criticized as needlessly scaring people about the dangers of roller coasters. And it's true that the statistics aren't quite as terrifying as the rides. As the National Review put it this year, ""Americans are 5,000 times more likely to be legally executed by their own government than to die on a roller coaster."" The writer, Charles C.W. Cooke, puts the odds of roller coaster death at 1 in 1.5 billion in a given year, compared with a 1 in 10 million chance of being killed ""because the aircraft he is traveling on falls apart."" But that framing is misleading, given how little is known about national roller coaster injuries. One of the best sources of information comes from a Center for Injury and Policy Research study of child injuries in the United States. After looking at injuries that were treated in hospitals from 1990 to 2010, the group found that a child is hospitalized from an injury related to an amusement park, carnival, fair or arcade-type ride once every three days in the summer, Mehan said. These are serious injuries: fractures, neck injuries and traumatic brain injuries. Including less serious injuries like bruises and sprains, about 4,440 child injuries are reported to hospitals each year on the rides, including those at fairs and other attractions, she said. The rate is 20 injuries per day during the summer months. ""We would really like to see a national database or a national system put in place so we can get a picture of what's happening,"" she said. The group was unable to compile info on deaths, for example. Regardless of the stats, however, it's the joy-gone-wrong factor that makes roller coaster deaths particularly horrifying. Are those fears slightly irrational and disproportionate? Maybe. But safety seems far from assured these days. Improvements, of course, must be weighed against deadlier public safety concerns. More should be done, for instance, to prevent road-traffic deaths, which kill about 1.3 million people globally each year. Many of those deaths could be prevented with simple changes to traffic laws and other rules, according to a fascinating report from Bloomberg Philanthropies (PDF); and self-driving cars could lead to greater reductions, still. But the existence of more-pressing and deadlier threats does not justify lax oversight of amusement park rides that are meant to entertain. Roller coaster fans should support a review of safety requirements. Otherwise, at the very least, they risk having a joyous experience soured by fear.

"(CNN) -- One year after leading the New York Knicks to their first division title in nearly two decades, head coach Mike Woodson is out of a job. The Knicks announced Monday they fired Woodson and his coaching staff, days after the team failed to clinch a playoff spot. Woodson's departure is the first big move by team President Phil Jackson -- who won championships as a coach with the Bulls and Lakers -- since the latter arrived last month. ""I have a tremendous amount of respect for Mike Woodson and his entire staff,"" Jackson said in a statement. ""The coaches and players on this team had an extremely difficult 2013-14 season, and blame should not be put on one individual. But the time has come for change throughout the franchise as we start the journey to assess and build this team for next season and beyond. ""Everyone in this franchise owes a great deal of gratitude to what Mike and his staff have done. We wish him the best."" The Knicks finished ninth in the NBA's Eastern Conference this year with a 37-45 record. Woodson was 109-79 as head coach for the Knicks.

"(CNN) -- For better or worse, Dylan Quick transformed his life on the campus of Lone Star College. Born deaf, he overcame intense shyness with a cochlear implant and learned to express himself by joining a teen book club at age 12 at the college library, according to a profile of him on a student blog. The library club became like a ""family"" and ""second home"" for him, the profile said. But he harbored a dark secret that played out eight years later after he enrolled as a student at the community college, authorities allege. Quick, 20, is accused of a carrying out a bloody stabbing rampage Tuesday at Lone Star College's CyFair campus near Houston, and on Wednesday, he was ""interacting well with investigators,"" Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia told reporters. Forthcoming with information, Quick told police he had fantasies of stabbing people since he was 8 years old and that he had been planning Tuesday's spree ""for some time,"" Garcia said. The rampage resulted in injuries to 14 people. The weapon used in Tuesday's stabbings is best described as a ""razor utility knife,"" Garcia said. The crimes occurred on two floors at the school's health science center, Garcia said. It's unclear how many of the injured were stabbed and how many suffered other injuries. Three people injured in Tuesday's Lone Star College stabbing were discharged from Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center in Houston on Wednesday, while two others remained there in good condition, said hospital spokeswoman Kathryn Klein. The campus shut down Tuesday, but reopened Wednesday. Authorities and the blog portrayed Quick as someone who triumphed over deafness -- with the help of the college's teen book club -- and had big plans for the future. Those plans now seem upended. Quick was undergoing a psychological evaluation Wednesday, and his first court appearance is scheduled for Thursday in Houston, the Harris County District Attorney's Office said. Quick has been charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, said Donna Hawkins of the Harris County District Attorney's Office. Overcoming obstacles . Quick received the cochlear implant at age 7, CNN affiliate KPRC reported. An article on how he overcame challenges early in life appeared on the Lone Star student blog the first week of April. The implant gave him the ability to hear, but he had to play catchup to learn how to speak vocally. His mother home-schooled him and got him involved in Lone Star's library programs when he was a teen, according to KPRC. Quick became a voracious reader and developed a close connection with the school, the affiliate said. He rarely spoke during his first two years in the library's teen activities program, including two monthly book club sessions devoted to classics and contemporary books, and weekly summer book groups. ""But after those two years it was if a floodgate had opened up and Dylan became loquacious, sharing his analyses of literature and socializing with his book club comrades,"" the blog article says. The blog features photos of the red-haired Quick at the library, including one at age 14 wearing an ""AC/DC Back In Black"" T-shirt with his arm around his red-haired mother. A more recent photo shows Quick with a mustache and petite goatee. ""His room at home, he explains, barely contains his 1,000+ collection of books. In the future he plans to build and host an online international book club to connect people of all ages from around the world,"" the profile says. The teen book club on campus encourages youths to enroll in the community college after high school graduation, and Quick did. Some faculty members said Quick was a good student there, Lone Star College-CyFair President Audre Levy told reporters Wednesday. Also, staff members at the county library branch on campus, where Quick worked part-time for about a year, ""had fond things to say of him,"" Levy said. ""So many are surprised"" that he was the suspect, she said. Quick was planning to finish his associate's degree at the college and then transfer to the University of Houston to study accounting. But Quick had also been harboring his darker dream, police said. Authorities: The rampage was premeditated . ""According to the statement the suspect voluntarily gave investigators, he has had fantasies of stabbing people to death since he was in elementary school,"" a statement from the Harris County Sheriff's Office said. Witnesses to the stabbings described a chaotic scene: Bleeding victims collapsed to the ground. Students and teachers ran for cover. Some sprang into action, chasing after the assailant and helping the wounded. Cassie Foe was in the school's nursing lab when she heard a scream in the hallway. Moments later, the nursing student put her training into action, placing pressure on a wound in a stabbing victim's neck. ""It just seemed like he was just going around, basically getting whoever was more open and easiest for him to reach,"" Foe told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday. Steven Maida said he saw so many people swarming that he thought it was a campus tour. Then, he saw them running and heard someone say, ""My friend's been stabbed."" Maida said he saw blood on a stairway and several injured victims. ""I just took off downstairs running,"" he said. He was looking for the attacker. Maida described joining a group of students who chased the suspect, tackled him and pinned him down until authorities arrived. ""I couldn't run the other way like everyone else was,"" he said. A bloody spree . Sheriff's Deputy Thomas Gilliland said authorities received an initial report that the suspect had been wrestled to the ground by a student before campus police arrested him. At least one injured victim had what appeared to be the blade of a box cutter or an X-Acto knife sticking out of her cheek, student Melody Vinton told CNN affiliate KHOU. Vinton said she had just left her chemistry class when she saw the attacker stabbing people, aiming at their necks and faces. Soon, she was trying to help victims, ripping a paper towel dispenser off a bathroom wall to get enough paper to help stem the bleeding. ""I turned around, and there was just blood. Just blood dripping down the stairs, all over the floor, all over everyone's towels on their necks. Just a lot of blood,"" she told KHOU. Four injured victims ""were taken out on helicopters,"" Harris County sheriff's spokesman Alan Bernstein said. Tuesday's incident came more than two months after three people were wounded in a shooting at a different Lone Star College campus -- the North Harris campus in Houston. CNN's Ed Lavandera, Joe Sutton, Jason Morris, Dave Alsup, Chandler Friedman, Greg Botelho, Paul Caron, Chuck Johnston, Ashley Fantz and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","NEW: Student blog says ""it was if a floodgate had opened"" as suspect overcomes shyness .

"(CNN) -- Tire talk may be dominating the 2013 Formula One championship but Italian manufacturer Pirelli insists they are not to blame for the dangerous blow-outs that compromised driver safety at the British Grand Prix. Pirelli attracted more media attention after the race at Silverstone, England than Nico Rosberg, who won the race for Mercedes Sunday. But despite facing intense scrutiny the Italian company say it was how the teams chose to use the tires that led to the rubber unraveling on six cars, including Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton -- who led the race early on -- and both Ferraris. ""A series of different causes led to the tire failures at Silverstone,"" said Pirelli in a statement. ""Rear tires mounted the wrong way round... In other words, the right-hand tire being placed where the left-hand one should be and vice versa on the cars that suffered failures. ""Low tire pressures, extreme cambers [the angle at which the tire slants away from the car] and high kerbs... Such as that on Turn Four at Silverstone which was the scene of most of the failures. ""The 2013 tires do not compromise safety if used in the correct way."" The drivers and teams had called for urgent action after the dramatic scenes at Silverstone and the sport's governing body responded immediately by amending its rules which prevent race drivers testing and tires being changed during the season. The FIA have decided to turn a three-day test for young drivers at Silverstone later this month into a tire development test involving the F1 teams and first-choice drivers. Pirelli has also reacted by introducing new rear tires for this weekend's German Grand Prix at the Nurburgring. No arguments, no attacks . These new tires are strengthened with Kevlar -- a high-strength, synthetic material -- instead of the steel used in the 2013 tires. The teams trialled this new rubber in Canada but failed to unanimously agree to then introduce it for the races in Montreal and Silverstone. Pirelli hope to provide a long-term solution by introducing a new range of tires from the Hungarian Grand Prix at the end of July onwards. The teams will test trial tires, which will go back to 2012's construction, at the test in Britain between July 17-19. ""What happened at Silverstone was completely unexpected,"" said Pirelli's motorsport director Paul Hembery. ""These incidents, which have upset us greatly, have stressed the urgency of the changes that we already suggested. ""I would like to underline the collaboration and support that we are receiving from the teams, drivers, FIA and FOM [the sport's commercial rights holder and broadcaster]. ""In no way are we intending to create arguments or attack anybody. We have taken our responsibilities upon ourselves."" Mercedes motorsport director Toto Wolff has welcomed Pirelli's explanation and planned changes. ""Pirelli apologised and made a clear statement that it wasn't about complaining or saying that somebody else was to be blamed,"" he told reporters. ""I guess Pirelli are going to be clearer in advising the teams in terms of camber, on tire pressures and on swapping the rear tyres. Most of the teams swap tyres and have been doing it for many races. ""Safety is a priority and it's a moment where Formula 1 must show unity and concentrate on solving the issues."" Tires still a concern . Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso said on the team website: ""After what we saw in Silverstone, we now go to the Nurburgring, confident we can see an improvement. ""I know that various modifications have been applied and let's hope that means all of us drivers can race in safe conditions. ""At the moment, we can't make any predictions, because no one has tried them and we don't know what and how many benefits they can bring, apart from trusting in the fact that it won't be dangerous to race."" But Hamilton, who lost the race lead in Britain after his left-rear tire dramatically exploded on the eighth lap of the race, warned: ""I think it's still a concern and something where we need to see how it goes."" The fall-out from the British race means there will be regulated in-season tire testing as well as plans to introduce further testing next January. In June, Pirelli and Mercedes were reprimanded at an FIA hearing for organizing a three-day tire test in May. The German team's ""secret"" test still riles their rivals -- especially as they have since won races in Monaco and Britain -- but the shocking tire explosions at Silverstone underlined the need for Pirelli to find a legitimate solution to the tire failures. Pirelli had wanted to introduce a new tire construction at the Canadian Grand Prix in June but failed to get all the teams to agree to the plan at a meeting in Monaco. A spate of worryingly delaminations -- where the tire layers separate -- earlier in the season had led to concerns the tires were not safe. When Pirelli took over from Bridgestone as F1's official tire supplier in 2011, the rubber was deliberately designed to be less durable so that teams would take more pit stops and the racing would be more unpredictable. But subsequent changes to the construction of the 2013 tire, based on the same principles, have now provoked not just unpredictability but chaos on the track. The Italian company now hopes the introduction of new tires and an agreement to monitor and test the tires throughout the season, with the cooperation of the teams and the sport's governing body, will put an end to the problems. New deal . The Italian company are close to agreeing a new deal to continue as F1's tire supplier when its current contract runs out at the end of the season. Pirelli say they now just need to secure agreement from some of the teams. Being F1's tire supplier is an expensive business with Pirelli effectively paying to supply tires to the F1 grid in a negotiated deal which also includes track-side advertising. The teams pay a small contribution towards the rubber but the bulk of the bill for the season's 36,000 spheres of rubber is picked up by the tire supplier. ""It's not cheap,"" said Hembery. ""I'm sure there are quite a few teams who don't have our overall budget to be in F1."" The smallest teams on the grid still spend $52m a year running their F1 teams. ""It's a lot of money isn't it?"" Hembery said ruefully.","Pirelli offers its explanation for tire blow-outs at British Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Undercover FBI agents in Florida found what investigators believe is a stolen Henri Matisse painting that had been missing for nearly a decade, officials said Wednesday. Two suspects were arrested in Miami Beach after trying to sell ""Odalisque in Red Pants,"" valued at $3 million, federal prosecutors said. The painting was stolen from a Venezuelan art museum in 2002, the statement said. Pedro Antonio Marcuello Guzman, 46, of Miami and Maria Martha Elisa Ornelas Lazo, 50, of Mexico City are charged with transporting and possessing the stolen painting, the FBI said. If convicted, they face up to 10 years in prison. Undercover agents made the arrest Tuesday at Loews Miami Beach Hotel, CNN affiliate WPLG reported. Marcuello set up the deal, told agents he knew the painting was stolen and asked them to pay $740,000 for it, the FBI and federal prosecutors said Wednesday, citing an affidavit filed in support of a criminal complaint. Ornelas was a Mexican national who worked as a vacation rental agent in Acapulco, according to WPLG. She arrived at the Miami International Airport on a flight from Mexico City on Monday, carrying a red tube containing the painting, prosecutors said. The next day, Ornelas and Marcuello met with undercover agents and were arrested. Sarah Murov, a spokeswoman for the hotel, declined to comment, referring questions to the FBI. The Venezuelan government had ""initiated the steps for the prompt return"" of the painting and asked the FBI to confirm reports of its recovery, the country's Institute of Cultural Patrimony said. ""Odalisque in Red Pants"" was reported stolen from the Caracas Museum of Contemporary Art in 2003, when officials revealed that another painting that had been hanging in its place was a fake. The museum purchased the painting from a New York art gallery in 1981. Marcuello and Ornelas made their first appearance in a Florida federal court Wednesday. Their pretrial detention hearing is scheduled for Friday. Stolen Salvador Dali painting returned .","Two people are charged with possessing the stolen painting, the FBI says .

"(CNN)  -- Wimbledon is the oldest grand slam in tennis, dating back to 1877, and it boasts a rich and varied history. The famous tournament is underway for the 125th time prompting CNN to dig through the archives to find nine interesting and curious facts you may not have known about the event. From the royal connection to the unusual adornment on top of the men's singles trophy; to the crowd's obsession with strawberries and cream and little-known original use for the All England grounds, each combine to make Wimbledon so special. If you can add to the selection, please use the comment box below the story. The Royal performer . Immortalized by the Colin Firth's Oscar-winning portrayal in the King's Speech, King George VI may have lacked fluency in his public speaking but was obviously a dab hand at tennis. While still the Duke of York, the future British monarch played in the 1926 Wimbledon championships. Unfortunately his appearance in the men's doubles competition was brief, beaten in the first round with his partner Sir Louis Greig. The Royal Box . The future King George VI was also a regular in the special area on Centre Court which has been reserved for the British Royal Family and guests of Wimbledon since 1922. The box is 12 feet (4m) off the ground and contains 74 regular wicker chairs in dark green Lloyd Loom. The practice of players curtsying or bowing to members of the royal family who were in attendance was stopped in 2003, but it is still in place for the Queen Elizabeth II, who visited in 2010. Rufus the hawk . Wimbledon has its own resident hawk, who goes by the name of Rufus. The Harris Hawk visits the All England club most weeks of the year with the main aim of deterring local pigeons from doing their worst. During the championships, Rufus' patrols are stepped up and he flies for one hour most mornings before the gates open to the public. Wartime Wimbledon . During World War II all tennis halted at Wimbledon, but the grounds of the All England club were pressed into action to aid the British war effort. They were mainly used for civil defense by the Home Guard and fire and ambulance services, but the club also had a decontamination unit. During the conflict, a bomb ripped through Centre Court and 1,200 seats were damaged, but fortunately there were no casualties. The green green grass . A team of 45 ground staff lovingly tend the 19 courts which are all made of 100 per cent rye grass which is chosen for its ability to stand wear and tear. According to the official Wimbledon website, no less than one ton of grass seed is used every year. During the championship all courts are mown, rolled and re-lined each day with 3,000 gallons of water used as part of the preparation process. The grass is cut to 8mm for matches to ensure regular bounce for the elite of world tennis. Pineapple on top . The trophy for the men's singles at Wimbledon is one of the most recognizable in sport and dates back to 1887. The magnificent gold cup stands 18 1/2 inches high and has a diameter of 7 1/2 inches, but the eagle-eyed might notice the pineapple design which adorns the top of the lid. A spokesperson for the Wimbledon museum told CNN that information remains scarce about the origins of the actual cup. She offered the explanation that it could date back to the tradition where captains in the British navy coming back from sea put a pineapple on the gateposts of their home. Strawberries and cream . One of the traditional symbols of the championships of which a staggering 28,000 kg are consumed during Wimbledon fortnight, served with over 7,000 liters of fresh cream. They come from the ""Garden of England,"" the southern county of Kent, and are freshly picked the day before, arriving at SW19 in the early hours of the morning. They are part of a Wimbledon catering operation which is the biggest for a sporting event in Europe. The croquet connection . Croquet was the first sport to be played on the grounds of the All England Club  a quintessentially English pastime where players have to knock a wooden ball through hoops using a mallet type implement. It's a highly skilled game but once tennis was introduced to Wimbledon in 1877 interest in croquet receded. For sentimental reasons, croquet is still retained in the official title of the championships and a small lawn for the sport still exists on the grounds although too small for top-class competitions. Women's singles? It is fully 30 years since a married woman claimed the women's singles title at Wimbledon. Chris Evert-Lloyd of the United States beat Czech Hana Mandlikova in straight sets to win the trophy for the third and final time. Her husband at the time was John Lloyd, a former British number one and Davis Cup player.","The history of the world's oldest grand slam is littered with unusual facts .

"Washington (CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden sounded like someone who wants to be President when he spoke to CNN's ""New Day"" on Friday. He talked about America's potential and its role as a global leader, as well as his commitment to helping the middle class. He never mentioned the overwhelming early favorite for the 2016 Democratic nomination -- former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. What would the Democrats do without Clinton in 2016? Clearly Biden, the longtime senator who now is the White House conduit to blue-collar union workers essential to Democratic support, is seriously considering a presidential run. Asked by CNN's Kate Bolduan when he would decide, Biden answered a realistic timetable would be the summer of 2015. That response, and a closer look at Biden's words Friday, also show that if Clinton decides to run -- as expected -- then Biden will step aside. ""He is effectively saying, look, it depends on what Hillary Clinton decides to do,"" noted Gloria Borger, CNN's chief political analyst. Here are some of Biden's remarks in the interview with Bolduan, and a look at what he was really saying: . 1) ""There may be reasons I don't run, but there's no obvious reason for me why I think I should not run."" Biden is hedging his bets. He acknowledges it may not happen, but makes clear the reason won't be because he doesn't want to or isn't qualified for the job. That's another way of saying there are circumstances beyond his control, meaning a Clinton decision to enter the race. Supporters are already raising money for the former first lady and senator who served with Biden in President Barack Obama's Cabinet and would be the nation's first woman President. First on CNN: Ready for Hillary heads to South Carolina . Clinton has said she will make up her mind sometime in 2014. Polls show her with a commanding lead over other possible Democratic contenders, including Biden. CNN/ORC Poll: Christie's loss appears to be Clinton's gain . 2) ""Realistically, a year this summer."" Biden's answer when Bolduan asks for a timetable for his decision is the clearest signal that his choice depends on whether Clinton runs. To Peter Hamby, CNN Digital's national political reporter, waiting until the middle of 2015 -- just six months or so before the Iowa caucuses -- would be way too late to take on Clinton. ""If these guys are going to get in and run for president, whoever it is, challenging Hillary Clinton, they really have to start laying groundwork,"" Hamby said. ""They have to raise money and hire staff and recruit volunteers in these early states."" Hillary Clinton's Iowa problem . As vice president, Biden has the advantage of constant media focus if desired, which would help him maintain a high profile without some of the normal steps of mounting a presidential campaign. That could help if Clinton doesn't run and lesser-known contenders such as Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley enter the race. However, Biden's lag in announcing his candidacy would leave him at a huge disadvantage against a Clinton campaign expected to have the backing of the party machinery. Does Obama secretly support Hillary Clinton for 2016? 3) ""Am I the best qualified person to focus on the two things I've spent my whole life on -- give ordinary people a fighting chance to make it and a sound foreign policy that's based on national interest of the United States, where we not only are known for the power of our military, but the power of our example."" Biden lays out his rationale for running, stressing his two major strengths as a candidate -- foreign policy and working-class ties. As the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden has the necessary foreign policy credentials, particularly against candidate ABC (Anybody But Clinton). However, her four years as secretary of state negates some or all of a Biden advantage. On appealing to middle class workers, Biden showed his strength in the 2010 and 2012 elections when he went to states such as Ohio where Obama was less popular. In Clinton, though, he would face the wife of former President Bill Clinton, who remains extremely popular among traditional Democratic constituencies. In Friday's interview, Biden didn't mention Hillary Clinton by name, but she is the biggest factor in whether he goes for it. 4) ""It doesn't mean I'm the only guy that can do it, but if no one else I think can and I think I can, then I will. If I don't I won't."" The vice president sums up his future decision with two qualifiers -- that no else runs who can do what he can, and that he still thinks he can deliver the goods. Biden could decide that he is better qualified than Clinton on what he considers the key issues, but he would have to think twice if her already anticipated campaign has started strongly and generated initial momentum. If he were to run and win in 2016, Biden would be 74 when he took office, making him the oldest ever to begin a presidency. By the end of his first term, he would be the oldest U.S. President in history. So while he remains energetic and passionate, talking about getting his Corvette Z06 from zero to 60 in 3.4 seconds, the clock is ticking and Biden knows it. A more diverse slate of GOP presidential possibles . Christie and Perry: 'They just don't like each other' Sen. Paul: Lewinsky scandal still a liability for Democrats .

"(CNN) -- If you've traveled to Asia at all, the center of all things techy and kitschy, you've no doubt witnessed some of the odd stuff sold in vending machines there. (Japan, in fact, has the highest concentration of vending machines in the world, with one per every 23 people.) Drop your coins in the slot and you can retrieve everything from fresh eggs to pet rhinoceros beetles. There's even a new machine in Singapore that dispenses free bottles of Coke in exchange for a hug (yes, you have to actually wrap your arms around the machine). But unusually stocked vending machines are showing up more and more frequently in the United States these days, particularly in airports and other areas heavily trafficked by travelers. So stock up your change purse and check out these nine vending machines that deliver both quirkiness and convenience. Cupcakes, Sprinkles bakery . Have a ferocious sweet tooth? Famed Los Angeles-based cupcake maker Sprinkles made it easy to satisfy your craving no matter the time of day or night when it unveiled the first of its 24-hour cupcake ATMs, which was installed outside its original Beverly Hills location. The individually boxed confections go for $4 apiece, come in a variety of flavors, and are said to never be more than a few hours old. Photos: Earth's otherworldly landscapes . Original artworks, Smithsonian American Art Museum . After a visit to this D.C. art museum showcasing the works of everyone from Georgia O'Keeffe to John Singer Sargent, you may be inspired to start a collection of your own. Thanks to the on-site Art-o-mat, one of dozens located at galleries and similar locales throughout the country, $5 is all you'll need to get started. Simply put your money in the slot, pull the handle, and out pops a pocket-size masterpiece created by one of 400 artists from around the world. The Art-o-mats, which are all reconfigured from vintage cigarette machines, are somewhat of a work of art in themselves. The world's record-breaking airports . Women's flats, Vegas hotels . In Vegas, just outside the TAO nightclub in the The Venetian hotel and the Vanity club at the Hard Rock Hotel, there are handy little dispensaries aimed at ladies suffering the aches and pains of having danced the night away in sky-high stilettos. For $19.95, they can purchase a pair of stylish Rollasole ballet flats that unfold to provide their feet instant relief from teetering around in high heels all evening. Fresh flowers, Nashville International Airport . Picking up a loved one at the airport and want to welcome them with a handful of colorful blooms? You're in luck, as Nashville International in Tennessee is just one of 29 airports in cities across the U.S. that features a refrigerated 24-Hour Flower vending machine selling bouquets of flowers that start at as little as $10. The company's newest flower dispensary is at the brand new Terminal 3 at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. Gold bars, Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino . The Golden Nugget in Atlantic City, New Jersey, seems an appropriate location for a vending machine that sells a selection of gold bars and coins. The 300-plus items inside the GOLD to go ATM are sold by the ounce or gram and their prices are updated every 60 seconds according to market fluctuations. The Golden Nugget in Las Vegas also offers this shopping convenience. Beach gear, Miramar Beach . It happens all the time: You drive to the coast, scope out the perfect spot on the sand, lay out your towel, and are about to dive into the surf when you realize you've forgotten the sunscreen. At Gulf-front Miramar Beach in Destin, Florida, there's no need to pack everything back up for a trip to go get some SPF 30. Simply head to the Sandbox vending machine adjacent to the beach bar at Pompano Joe's Seafood House, and you'll find a selection of sunscreen, sunglasses, goggles, floats and other fun-in-the-sun necessities. Luxury goods, Hudson Hotel . Designed as an alternative to the traditional hotel gift shop, the unique vending machine at this trendy New York City lodging, nicknamed Semi-Automatic, contains a curated collection of designer items like Comme des GarÃ§ons wallets, Nixon watches, and Ray-Ban sunglasses. Got an extra $90,000? Splurge on its most expensive selection: the keys to a brand new Bentley Arnage T. Clothes to go, South Station . Forgot to pack clean underwear for your big trip to Bean Town? Visitors arriving through the South Station bus and train terminal in Boston can stock up on undies, T-shirts, socks, scarves and the like from Automatic Apparel's automated clothing ""store.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The State Department's Inspector General's Office is criticizing both a private contractor and U.S. government officials for ""considerable construction deficiencies"" in the new U.S. Embassy in Iraq. In a report released Thursday, Acting Inspector General Harold W. Geisel lists incomplete design work, safety questions and maintenance problems that he says may continue for years. The report recommends that the State Department try to get a $132 million refund from the major construction contractor, First Kuwaiti Trading and Contracting. The embassy -- the largest such U.S. facility in the world -- ended up costing more than $700 million, with First Kuwaiti receiving more than $470 million. The compound includes working space for more than 1,000 people and housing for several hundred. It officially opened in January. A special office set up by the State Department to oversee the construction of the Baghdad Embassy failed to carry out its administrative responsibilities or enforce the provisions of the contract, the report says. The State Department says in the report that procedures for future projects will be different. One problem cited by the Inspector General's Office is inadequate emergency ""safe areas"" inside the embassy compound. It suggests the State Department try to recover $4.6 million ""to repair safe areas, which are vital to protecting staff in emergency situations but which were not constructed according to contract specifications."" ""We found that although the construction ... [of the embassy] in a war zone in 34 months was a significant accomplishment, considerable construction deficiencies remained because designs for the facilities had not been completed and approved and quality control and commissioning procedures were inadequate,"" the report says. ""Without a valid design and robust quality control and commissioning activities, the department cannot be assured that the NEC [new embassy compound] complies with contract and department requirements, as well as with applicable building codes,"" it says. The report, which was sent to Congress earlier this week, adds, ""As a result of construction deficiencies, incomplete and undocumented design work, additional maintenance charges attributable to inadequate quality control and commissioning procedures, and unrecovered liquidated damages and interest on unauthorized advance mobilization payments, we recommend that the Department of State attempt to recover more than $132 million from First Kuwaiti.""","Report recommends U.S. try to get a $132 million refund .

"(CNN) -- Russian football has been blighted by a series of high-profile incidents of racial abuse in recent times, an issue the country's soccer administrators are eager to address ahead of the FIFA World Cup arriving in 2018. Global attention was drawn to the issue when veteran Anzhi Makhachkala full-back Roberto Carlos, a World Cup winner with Brazil in 2002, was subjected to abuse by both Zenit St. Petersburg and Krylya Sovetov fans. As a result of the abuse, which included the former Real Madrid star having a banana thrown at him, both clubs were fined $10,000. And racism in the Russian Premier League has been brought back into focus by events on Sunday, when Carlos' Congolese teammate Christopher Samba was subjected to the same form of abuse. Samba, who moved to Anzhi from English Premier League side Blackburn Rovers last month, had a banana thrown at him from the VIP box of Lokomotiv Moscow's Lokomotiv Stadium. ""We are deeply disappointed with the idiotic episode that happened to our player Christopher Samba after the match at Lokomotiv,"" read a statement from the Dagestan-based team. ""We are assured that the representatives of the football authorities, the security service of Lokomotiv, will settle this issue and the guilty will be identified and punished."" An investigation into the incident was launched on Tuesday and the Russian Football Union (RFU) have now gone one step further by launching a dedicated anti-racism taskforce. ""The RFU's ethics committee has decided to create a special working group made up of members of the committee,"" the organization said on its website. The group will be tasked with battling ""racism, xenophobia and extremism."" France-born defender Samba was upset by the incident and slammed the action as a poor example to young fans. ""I`m very upset that such misconduct took place in view of children who were sitting in those very stands. It can serve as a bad example for them. ""I try not to think about racism. I just want to believe that such problems do not exist on a global basis. Maybe I am mistaken but I do want to believe in it. ""As a rule any scandal of this kind is a result of a misconduct committed by one silly person. I don`t want to react to this."" The Russian Premier League vowed to hunt down the fan who had hurled the banana at the 27-year-old. ""Our aim is to find the man who threw banana at Samba,"" the league's security Alexander Meitin was reported to have said by AFP.","Russian Football Union to launch a group aimed at tackling racism in the sport .

"(CNN) -- On Monday, we paid homage to our fallen troops with bratwursts and kielbasa, and that means it's officially the season of picnics, boat shoes and strolls along the boardwalk, hand in hand. As couples pop up out of the woodwork, we deemed it a good time to remind you that as a duo, your doings -- both digital and IRL -- will come under particular scrutiny. In other words: You've got the potential to tick a lot of (probably jealous) people off. A study that came out this February noted that couples tend to have similar Facebooking habits (intense and burning love for the sweet coding of Zucks, time spent on the site, etc.) The researchers hypothesize that we simply fall for people with similar interests, but it makes sense to us that this is more effect than cause -- couples might start to follow their partner's lead, e.g., amping up their time on the site if their partner's an avid poster. So if either you or your beau is doing something annoying on Facebook, Twitter, and the like, you're probably both guilty of it. We're happy for you, really, we are. But in the meantime, we call for a cease and desist of the following obnoxious tics: . The couple-y crime: Gushing nonstop . The online equivalent of: Out-of-control PDA -- e.g., making out in line for a row of Port-a-potties, surrounded by hapless spectators who soon may need that toilet to vomit . An arty Instagram snap of your girlfriend making French toast for breakfast: cute. A second image 45 minutes later of her whipping up fritters for your fancy weekend picnic, with a caption that concludes, ""I have the best GF in the entire world!!!""? At a certain point, you're bragging, and those tasty beignets are being baked not just for the enjoyment of you but for the wistful salivation of everyone in your network. A good litmus test: If a single friend called and asked how you're doing, would you pass along the same number of sappy anecdotes and boundless approbation? If the answer's no, scale it back. The couple-y crime: Sharing a profile pic . The online equivalent of: Adopting his taste in music, movies and political opinions; forgoing first-person to constantly utilize the royal We (""We really love Mad Men,"" ""We thought the wine was a little tannin-y,"" ""We have slightly elevated blood pressure but it's only because we get nervous in doctors' offices."") This is a contentious topic, and indeed, there's nothing horrific about opening yourself up to your sig other's interests in B movies and chillwave tunes. But we're of the opinion that your Facebook profile is just that: yours, and showing two little faces to every person who searches for you (or glances at your Twitter or clicks on your blog or looks you up on LinkedIn -- avatars be er'ywhere) is just a little...strange. (Interestingly, the same 2012 study found that among their subjects -- white, 20-ish-year-old college couples -- the relationships were strongest in pairs where the chick had a FB profile pic of the two of them. But that's probably because a coed in a peachy relationship is likeliest to show her BF off the world.) If you must, use a cute, atmospheric photo of the two of you as your cover photo and pick a profile shot that shows your mug alone. Notable exception: If you have a pic that shows Jack White in between you two because you spotted him on the Lower East Side and stopped him even though he was obviously wearing a hat and trying to blend in -- by all means, make it your profile photo. Just take it down when the shock value has worn off.","Our Netiquette columnists offer advice for how couples should act on social media .

"(CNN) -- As protests sweep through Iran, a handful of Web sites -- Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube in particular -- are once again widely credited for their crucial role in the process. But before we swallow yet another dose of cyber-utopianism, a more critical look at how the Internet has abetted both sides is in order. The current protests very well may be a Twitter revolution, but only future historians would be able to say so conclusively. At the moment we simply do not know if Twitter and Facebook have helped boost the turnout at demonstrations. Iran-related discussions on the Internet have undeniably spiked, but it's impossible to tell how such messages, many written by foreign observers, influence Iranians' eagerness to risk their lives in the streets of Tehran or Isfahan. Moreover, virtually all recent protests in Iran have been tied to some important political, religious or historical occasion. For example, people turning out for two symbolic anniversaries on November 4, the religious holiday of Ashura and the death of Great Ayatollah Montazeri, were not spontaneous outbursts organized and publicized by the Twitterati. Such protests would have been well-attended even if the Internet did not exist. This is not to deny that both Twitter and Facebook have played an important role in publicizing videos and photos of police brutality, most of them snapped and distributed with mobile phones. Extraordinary as they are, we should not overestimate the usefulness of such materials. The Iranian regime has proved remarkably immune to getting a bad rap in the international press, not to mention the United Nations. Given the formidable risks that Iran's ""citizen journalists"" go through to record such videos, we in the West should be more cautious in encouraging them to capture the zeitgeist of the barricades. Also, in the absence of independent review by professional reporters working on the ground -- and those who were banned from Iran a long time ago --  many videos have to carry a host of disclaimers. Fake clips, usually made to provoke and split the opposition, are becoming a staple of the Iranian Internet. One such video, which portrayed someone burning a poster of the country's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei before a crowd of cheering people, circulated on foreign and Iranian Web sites in early December. Luckily, closer examination by Iranian and foreign bloggers showed that it was probably a skillful montage. But can thousands of similar videos be fact-checked as thoroughly? The proliferation of fake videos suggests that the Iranian government may, directly or indirectly, benefit from using digital space for propaganda. Even Twitter could become a potent tool of brainwashing: In early July, The Wall Street Journal reported that after two weeks of protests the number of pro-government messages on Twitter increased 200-fold compared with the period immediately after the election. Flooding Twitter with fake and pro-government updates is one way to make Twitter unusable for the Western audiences. How, after all, should we know what updates we can trust, if many of them are written by the government and its loyalists? It turns the Internet into the ""Spinternet."" That propaganda is displacing censorship as a primary means of controlling the Internet is quite remarkable. In the past, the Iranian government would have simply blocked access to dissenting sites. But blocking Twitter is impractical: Not only would it be very expensive, but it would also disconnect the Iranian secret police from a valuable channel of gathering intelligence. Such intelligence reports come in very handy when protests fizzle out and repressions commence. The very first wave of post-election protests in the summer of 2009 left the Iranian authorities with a massive log of anti-government messages, all stored on Twitter and Facebook for posterity to process, analyze and act upon. What many cheerleaders of Iran's Twitter revolution fail to understand is that the easy availability of such information allows the regime to explore how various anti-government activists are connected to each other and to their foreign supporters. All it takes is looking up their Facebook profiles. It's hardly surprising, then, that many Iranian-Americans traveling to Iran after the summer protests complained they were asked if they had Facebook accounts. Passport control officials at Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport even forced some of them log into them. But even those Iranians abroad who did not travel anywhere and stayed at home complained of being harassed about their online activism. One could only guess what fate awaits those who stayed in the country. Making our way through billions of Twitter and Facebook updates, we should not lose sight of one critical feature of the digital age: The wealth of information trails generated by digital activists has also provided authoritarian governments with better means to identify and squash emerging threats to their hegemony. Even if the Iranian protests eventually succeed, it will be thanks to a combination of political, social and religious factors. Putting all our chips on information technology alone can have catastrophic consequences for the future of democracy in that country.

"Editor's note: This is part two of a two-part series on illegal immigration in Middle America. St. Bridget's Catholic Church has been spending $80,000 a month to help immigrants pay for their daily expenses. POSTVILLE, Iowa (CNN)  -- The Rev. Lloyd Paul Ouderkirk sits beneath a cross of Jesus, the sun shining through the stained-glass windows that line his church. ""Nobody can tell me to shut up,"" says Ouderkirk, the pastor of St. Bridget's Catholic Church in the tiny town of Postville, Iowa, the epicenter of the nation's immigration debate in rural communities. Ouderkirk is outraged at the way federal agents swooped into town and rounded up nearly 400 illegal immigrants on May 12 in a raid on the nation's largest kosher meatpacking plant, Agriprocessors. He's angry at the bosses of the plant who are accused of mistreating workers, including children, and using a workforce that the government contends was 75 percent illegal immigrants.  Watch ""we cried with them"" » . And he's upset that Iowa Gov. Chet Culver and other top state officials haven't set foot in Postville since the raid left the town of 2,400 ""bleeding to death."" The raid was the largest work-force raid in the nation's history at the time, what one court interpreter said ""criminalized the undocumented workers on a grand scale"" for the first time. ""I think every elected politician -- no exceptions -- should bow their heads in shame,"" Ouderkirk says. ""Upset?! Yeah, I'm upset. I mean give me a break ... If the elected politicians couldn't do any better than this to come up with a good, just immigration law, they should hang their heads in shame."" Within the next half hour, about two dozen women from Guatemala and Mexico begin arriving at his church, along with two men. All were picked up in the raid, but the federal government released them on humanitarian grounds because they are parents of children who are American citizens. Each wears an ankle bracelet. They are seeking political asylum or temporary residency within the United States.  See photos around Postville, Iowa » . Unable to work now, they come to St. Bridget's for financial help. The church pays their medical bills, food, rent and other daily expenses. ""They walk the streets here monitored wherever they go. They can't leave, they can't work, they all have children,"" Ouderkirk says. ""So effectively, they are prisoners in our town and in this parish."" Ouderkirk isn't the only one complaining. Mayor Bob Penrod said his town has been turned ""topsy turvy"" since the raid. He too wondered why he hasn't heard from the governor.   Watch a ""military raid"" on this town » . ""Basically all we wanted was some advice on how to deal with some of the situations that keep arising,"" Penrod says. Gov. Culver's office says his administration played a ""leading role"" in an investigation of the meatpacking plant that led to more than 9,000 charges of child labor violations against its bosses and managers. ""Gov. Culver has been a vocal critic of Agriprocessors,"" his office said in a written statement. It added that while the governor may not have visited, he has worked with state agencies to ""address the needs of the families in Postville."" Agriprocessors declined comment for this story. In a statement after the raid, the company said it ""cooperated with the government in the enforcement action. We intend to continue to cooperate with the government in its investigation. ... We extend our heartfelt sympathies to the families whose lives were disrupted and wish them the best."" The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement stands by the raid in Postville. ""Illegal aliens often turn to criminal activity, including document fraud, Social Security fraud or identify theft, in order to get jobs,"" ICE spokesman Tim Counts said in a written statement. ""The demand for fraudulent documents and identities created by them creates thriving criminal enterprises that supply them."" Ouderkirk, who came out of retirement after the raid, says it's costing his church $80,000 a month, and the church only has enough money to keep paying through the end of the year. ""It's pathetic when you have what was labeled by the man who directed the raid here as a 'very successful raid.' How successful is this when it does this to the children and breaks up families?"" Ouderkirk says. Rocelia Hernandez, a mother of four, came from Mexico seven years ago and worked at the kosher plant for three years. Displaying her ankle bracelet, she admits she entered the country illegally, but says she came to improve her children's lives. ""Since I arrived here, I haven't done anything but work because I wanted to have a house and have better things in the future for my children,"" Hernandez says. She says she was given a ""Social Security number that they invented for me."" Asked who made it, Hernandez says, ""I don't know. I never knew."" Hernandez says she's confused about why the government cracked down on her. The United States, she says, is a generous country that provides aid to countries to help impoverished people around the world. ""If the Americans have such a big heart or the government has such a big heart for other people, why don't they protect those of us who are already here? Why do they kick us out?"" she says. ""I want my son to learn the language and stay here and have a better life,"" Hernandez says of her 5-year-old American-born son. Ouderkirk puts it more succinctly. ""This is no way as a democracy to treat people. I don't care if they are legal or illegal. You don't tear families apart like this,"" Ouderkirk says. ""The women and children we're taking care of right now are no more criminal than people driving down the street breaking the speed limit.""  See where Postville is located » . The federal government disagrees. Of the 389 captured that day in May, nearly 300 of them were charged with felony counts of aggravated identity theft and fraudulent use of Social Security numbers. Those slaughterhouse workers were tried and convicted in less than two days on a cattle fairground where Iowans typically come to cheer cowboys who lasso raging bulls. Most were sentenced to five months in prison. ""The federal court got taken for a ride,"" says Erik Camayd-Freixas, a federal certified interpreter who was there. ""There was no presumption of innocence."" A court interpreter is supposed to be an impartial representative of the government. Camayd-Freixas has worked as an interpreter for 23 years, but says what happened in Postville touched a nerve and forced him to speak out. ""The truth is that nothing could have prepared me for the prospect of helping our government put hundreds of innocent people in jail,"" he said in a written personal account. Camayd-Freixas says those arrested pleaded guilty to the charges often not knowing what they were pleading to. A person charged with identity theft has to knowingly take the ""identification of another person with the intent to commit, or to aid or abet, any unlawful activity that constitutes a violation of federal law,"" according to federal identity theft law. ICE's affidavit is vague on that point, describing workers going to a third-party source for documents. Most of the Agriprocessor workers, Camayd-Freixas says, had no idea they were using somebody else's identity because they ""took whatever number was given to them."" Camayd-Freixas says he understands the workers were in America illegally, but he questions the legality of trying them on felony offenses. ""These are common workers and they are parading them as criminals. There's something wrong here,"" he says. ""I was there and I saw it."" He says the guilty pleas could have a staggering effect on separate, extremely serious state investigations of Agriprocessors. The state of Iowa filed 9,300 misdemeanor charges against owners and managers at Agriprocessors accusing them of child labor law violations. The state needs the immigrants -- the same ones the federal government wants deported -- to testify in any potential trial against their bosses. ""The immigrants have no credibility because they plead guilty,"" Camayd-Freixas says. ""The whole thing is just ill conceived."" Camayd-Freixas, acting as an academic consultant for the Guatemalan consul general, recently visited with 94 of the Postville workers being held at two facilities in Miami, Florida. Their sentences ended last weekend and they will likely get deported beginning this week. He says 16 have been recalled for the Iowa investigations. ""They want to be deported back to Guatemala as soon as possible,"" Camayd-Freixas says. ""Every week they don't work is another week their children go hungry."" Back in Postville, Ouderkirk says he'll keep speaking his mind. He invites vocal opponents of illegal immigration to come to his church and ""walk in the shoes"" of the immigrants he's helping. He says he's ""gotten hate letters like you wouldn't believe."" ""If people have a right to spout off like that, then I have a right to speak in defense of these poor people,"" he says. ""This is a free country. I have a right to speak what I believe in, and I have a right to speak up for poor people whose voice is being denied.""","Postville, Iowa, priest: ""Every elected politician ... should bow their heads in shame""

"Bellefonte, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- The prosecution's final accuser Thursday refused to look at Jerry Sandusky when he pointed to him minutes after telling jurors the former Penn State assistant football coach sodomized him and forced him to perform oral sex while he stayed in Sandusky's basement during visits. The sexual abuse occurred during a number of visits, the witness, now 18, testified. ""There was no fighting against it."" ""Alleged Victim No. 9"" said he screamed during one incident, hoping Sandusky's wife might hear him from upstairs. There was no answer. ""I think the basement is soundproof,"" said Alleged Victim 9, becoming emotional during portions of his testimony. CNN generally does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault. Jerry Sandusky trial: All you need to know . The accuser said he started going to the Sandusky home when he was about 12 and stopped going in 2009. He said he met the defendant a few years before while swimming at a summer camp sponsored by Second Mile, the charity founded by Sandusky. ""He seemed nice,"" the witness said of Sandusky. When asked to identify his attacker, the witness pointed to Sandusky without looking at him. ""I don't want to look at him,"" he said. Jurors earlier Thursday heard from two other accusers and a police officer and an investigator. Judge John Cleland indicated he expected the commonwealth of Pennsylvania to conclude its case in the afternoon, but that was not the case. No proceedings are planned for Friday; the trial will resume Monday. During testimony Thursday, Alleged Victim 9 said that Sandusky went from presenting gifts to hugging him and kissing him. He told his mother about it, saying Sandusky was a ""touchy-feely type of person, that's all."" The physical contact escalated, the accuser said. ""He started getting physical, had me touch his penis and stuff."" The witness said he did not want to keep returning to the Sandusky home, but his mother wanted him to. The accuser was asked whether he told her about the alleged sexual contact. ""No,"" the witness said. ""How are you supposed to tell your mom these things?"" The accuser said he finally had enough in 2009 and asked his mother to pick him up from the Sandusky house. ""I didn't tell her why."" He testified he didn't discuss the matter with police until later, when his mother called them, and only told his entire story when he met with prosecutors. Under cross-examination, the accuser said he and a friend went to a football game in autumn 2011, accompanied by Sandusky, because the friend of the teen had never been to a football game. Earlier, a police officer testified that he investigated after a woman reported Sandusky had showered with her son in 1998. He said he felt charges should have been filed against Sandusky then, but prosecutors at the time did not agree. Ronald Schreffler, a former Penn State police investigator who now works for the Department of Homeland Security, said he was among officers hiding in the woman's home when she confronted Sandusky about her suspicions regarding inappropriate behavior with her son, identified as Alleged Victim 6. He testified he heard Sandusky tell her: ""I wish I could ask forgiveness. I know I can't get it from you. I wish I were dead."" Another witnesses, Anthony Sassano, an agent with the state attorney general's office, testified photos of some of the accusers were found in a photo album during a June 2011 search of the defendant's house. A list of those who participated in camps put on by Second Mile also was found in the residence, according to Sassano. Sassano said he found in Sandusky's abandoned Penn State office lists of Second Mile children with notations next to the names of some of the alleged victims. Sandusky, longtime defensive coordinator for the Nittany Lions, faces 52 counts tied to what prosecutors say was his systematic abuse of at least 10 boys over a span of 15 years. Now 68, Sandusky has been under house arrest in the days leading up to his trial. He has pleaded not guilty and has maintained his contact with children was not sexual. Another witness, Alleged Victim 3, testified Thursday that Sandusky would touch him inappropriately during showers and overnight stays at the former Penn State coach's home. He testified that he was part of Second Mile and that he stayed overnight at Sandusky's home ""more than 50 times."" Sandusky often came downstairs where he was sleeping, he said. ""He would ask me why I would want to sleep with all my clothes on, so eventually I'd be stripped down to my underwear,"" said the man, now 25. ""He'd jump into bed with me, start tickling me, blowing on my stomach and pelvis. He would also, at times, touch my penis."" Asked if he told Sandusky to stop, he said, ""No. I was enjoying the things I was getting too much,"" referencing trips to football games and favors from Sandusky. ""He made me feel like I was part of something, like a family,"" he said. ""He gave me things that I had never had before. ... I loved him."" He said he never told anyone about his experiences. Eventually, he said, he was sent to group homes, then foster care. ""He never contacted me,"" he said of Sandusky, saying he was angry ""because he could just forget about me, like I was nothing, after all that."" By 1999, as a 12-year-old, he testified, he was uncomfortable with the contact. ""I would roll over (in bed) and try to get away from him,"" he said. ""That's pretty much where it would stop; I wouldn't let it go any further."" Alleged Sandusky victim details abuse . Alleged Victim 6 testified about the 1998 incident, when he was 11, that triggered a police investigation. After working out with Sandusky at Penn State, he told jurors he recalled feeling uncomfortable while showering with Sandusky. He said that when both were naked, he started to shower across the room from Sandusky. ""I didn't want to be right next to him in the shower. I felt really awkward with that situation."" But, he said, Sandusky told him to come over next to him, then began tickling him. ""I believe at one point he grabbed me from behind and gave me a big bear hug. ... He said, 'I'm going to squeeze your guts out.' I remember seeing his chest hair right in my face, and thinking, 'This is icky.' "" He remembered Sandusky helped wash him and told him, "" 'Let me help you with your back, where you can't reach.' ... It was just escalating, the uncomfortableness of it."" He testified that he cannot remember anything, even the trip home, after Sandusky lifted him up to the shower head to get the shampoo out of his hair. ""It's just kind of black,"" he said. When he got home, he said he told his mother: ""'By the way, if you see my hair is wet, it's because we took a shower,"" adding, ""She knew who I took a shower with. I told her bits and pieces, but not about everything that happened."" His mother, he testified, called police. Schreffler testified he interviewed the boy and, after consulting with the district attorney's office, asked the mother to invite Sandusky to her home twice with authorities hiding in another room. During the second meeting, he heard Sandusky make the statement about forgiveness, he said. Schreffler said he talked with Sandusky as well. The then-coach acknowledged showering with other boys but said nothing sexual had taken place, he said. Sandusky ""stated that he did think it was maybe inappropriate,"" Schreffler said. ""He wouldn't do it again. ... He used the term 'bad judgment.'"" Asked if any charges were filed, Schreffler said, ""No. I felt there should be some charges, something, but the DA didn't go for that."" ""There was a missed opportunity in 1998, an opportunity that wasn't just missed by one person -- it was missed by multiple people,"" Howard Janet, an attorney representing Alleged Victim 6, told reporters afterward. Under cross-examination, Alleged Victim 6 acknowledged he maintained contact with Sandusky afterward, attending football games with him, meeting him and his wife for lunch and at one point borrowing his car. He also said he sent Sandusky holiday greetings, including one saying, ""I'm glad God has placed you in my life."" The two never again showered together, however, he said. Alleged Victim 3 was asked by defense attorney Joe Amendola about his grand jury testimony, in which he said he had stayed at the Sandusky home more than 25 times, not more than 50 as he testified Thursday. ""But then I thought about it more,"" the man said. ""I've tried to block this out of my brain."" Both accusers acknowledged Thursday they had hired civil attorneys, but said they had not paid them anything. Under questioning from Amendola, Schreffler looked at a transcript of his May 1998 interview with Alleged Victim 6 and testified the boy insisted Sandusky never touched him in an inappropriate place or asked the boy to touch his ""private parts."" In opening statements, defense lawyer Amendola suggested his client would take the stand and say he routinely ""got showers with kids"" after working out.

"(CNN) -- Charles Dickens, who was born 200 years ago this week, created some of the best-known and most loved figures in English literature, from Oliver Twist and David Copperfield to Pip, Miss Havisham and Magwitch. But of all the characters he wrote about, none played as important a role in his work as that of London itself: its hustle and bustle, its glittering promise and grimy streets and the extremes of poverty and wealth experienced by those who lived there. Alex Werner, the curator of the Museum of London's ""Dickens and London"" exhibition, says the city was ""absolutely central"" to Dickens' work. ""It triggered his imagination,"" he told CNN. ""He called it his 'magic lantern', and would spend hours pacing the streets, drawing inspiration from what he saw around him."" Read more: Dickens admirers mark bicentenary . London was Dickens' muse, helping to spark his creativity and provide ideas for some of the most memorable characters, settings and plot twists in English literature. As Britain -- and literature lovers the world over -- celebrates Dickens' bicentenary in 2012, what better time to explore the city he knew and loved best? Dickens in London . Dickens moved to London as a child, but the family soon ran into financial trouble: His father was sent to debtors' prison, and at the age of just 12, Dickens was forced to work in a shoe polish factory -- Warren's Blacking Warehouse, at Hungerford Stairs -- to support his mother and siblings. ""It was a crazy, tumbledown old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats... the dirt and decay of the place rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again,"" he later told his biographer, John Forster. Both the warehouse and the stairs, near what is now Embankment tube station, are long gone. The Charles Dickens Museum is housed in Dickens' former family home, in Doughty Street. It was here that he wrote ""Oliver Twist"" and ""Nicholas Nickleby."" Opened in 1925, the museum holds the world's most important collection of Dickens items, including his pens, letters, and furniture. It is to close for much of 2012 as part of a 3.1 million redevelopment project, but is expected to reopen before Christmas. The offices of All The Year Round, one of the magazines Dickens founded to publish his stories, are on Wellington Street, just off the Strand. At the height of Dickens' popularity, crowds would gather outside to wait for the latest episode. Today the Charles Dickens Coffee House is on the ground floor. Dickens is buried in Westminster Abbey's Poets' Corner, alongside other literary greats including Geoffrey Chaucer, Alfred Tennyson and Thomas Hardy. Many of the other members of the Dickens family, including his parents, John and Elizabeth -- the models for Mr Micawber and Mrs Nickleby -- his ex-wife Katherine, sister, and nephew -- the inspiration for Tiny Tim in ""A Christmas Carol"" -- are buried in Highgate Cemetery. To mark the Dickens bicentenary, the cemetery is hosting Dickens tours. Dickens' ties to London, and the role that the city played in his novels, are celebrated in the Museum of London's ""Dickens and London"" exhibition, which runs until June 10, 2012. The show features items from the author's own life -- his desk, and manuscripts -- as well as those evoking the city as he knew it. London in Dickens . A century and a half of modernisation has meant that many of the locations in Dickens' novels no longer exist -- but eagle-eyed visitors can still catch a glimpse of the city as Pip or Oliver would have recognized them. ""There is very little left,"" says Clare Pettitt, Dickens specialist at King's College London. ""You can track Dickens' London, and see where things were, but they aren't necessarily still there."" One site that Dickens returned to again and again, both in real life and in his novels (it features in ""Oliver Twist"" and ""The Pickwick Papers""), is Covent Garden -- though in his day, it was a proper working market, rather than the touristy shopping area it is today. Just around the corner, Bow Street Magistrates' Court -- now a police station -- is mentioned in both ""Oliver Twist"" and ""Barnaby Rudge."" As a young man, Dickens worked as a solicitor's clerk, and the Inns of Court, which in his day were home to many of the city's legal professionals, feature heavily in his works. Lincoln's Inn and Chancery Lane both feature heavily in ""Bleak House"", and nearby is The Old Curiosity Shop, one of the oldest shops in London. Gray's Inn is used as a location in both ""David Copperfield"" and ""The Pickwick Papers"". The tranquil square at historic Staple Inn, Holborn, is mentioned in Dickens' final, unfinished novel, ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood,"" where he reports that it ""imparts on the relieved pedestrian the sensation of having put cotton in his ears and velvet soles on his feet."" The bells of the clock tower in St Dunstan-in-the-West Church, Fleet Street, are the ones which wake Scrooge to his new life at the end of ""A Christmas Carol."" Raise a glass to Dickens . Pubs and taverns featured heavily in both Dickens life and his work, and several of those mentioned in his stories and letters are still serving today. Pettitt says one of his favourites was Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, just off Fleet Street. The pub features in ""A Tale of Two Cities,"" and has a wider literary pedigree, having also been a haunt of Samuel Johnson, W.B. Yeats and Mark Twain. Pettitt also recommends The Grapes pub in Limehouse, east London. ""It features in 'Our Mutual Friend,' and feels very 'Dickensian', overlooking the river, which was so important in his works, though of course these days it's not as full of boats as it was in his day."" And across the river in Greenwich, Alex Werner suggests the Trafalgar Tavern, which was famed, in Dickens' day, for its whitebait suppers. ""Dickens' letters are full of suggestions for various excursions along the river,"" explains Pettitt. ""He was always writing to people saying 'Let's go down to X and stop for dinner at Y' -- there was always a culinary target to his expeditions."" City walks . An insomniac, Dickens spent many hours walking London's streets in the dead of night. ""He knew its alleys and streets better than anyone,"" said Werner, explaining that some of Dickens' greatest works came about as a result of these lengthy strolls. ""We know from his letters that in October and November 1863, for example, he was walking 10 to 15 miles a night, while working on his book."" In the spirit of the man himself, several Dickens walking tours take place around the city. London Walks runs a Charles Dickens' London tour every Friday afternoon at 2.30pm, departing from Temple tube station. The company also runs special Dickensian Christmas walks in late November and December. To mark Dickens' bicentenary, the Dickens Museum is running a weekly Dickensian London walk each Wednesday evening, from February 8 to April 4, departing from the museum, in Doughty Street, at 5pm.

"(CNN) -- The world's population has more than tripled since I was born in 1938. On Monday, our world's population is expected to hit the milestone of 7 billion people -- up from 2.5 billion in 1950 -- with almost all of the growth expected to happen in the cities of less developed countries. This means that the problems the world faced when I was a child are even more urgent now for my grandchildren. If fertility rates continue at expected levels, the world's population is likely to reach 10.1 billion in the next 90 years. Based on conservative estimates, the number of people in the world should pass 8 billion in 2023, 9 billion by 2041 and 10 billion at some point after 2081. Just take a moment to think about that. By 2100, we could have nearly 50% more people on this planet than we did at the beginning of the century, competing for the same food, water, space and attention. One of the best ways to ensure that the 7 billionth child born will live in a safe, healthy and sustainable world is to focus on what women want and need. Researchers at the Guttmacher Institute found there are 215 million women worldwide who want the ability to time and space their pregnancies, but do not have access to effective methods of contraception. Women want to be able to deliver children safely and provide for them. According to the World Health Organization, in developing countries, pregnancy and childbirth complications are the leading cause of death among women in their reproductive years. In the developed world, one out of 4,300 women will die as a consequence of pregnancy. That number is one in 31 in sub-Saharan Africa, and a staggering one out of eight women dies giving birth in Afghanistan. The real tragedy is the fact that one-third of these deaths could be prevented if women had access to voluntary family planning. Universal access to voluntary family planning is a cross-cutting and cost-effective solution to achieving all of the Millennium Development Goals. In addition to reducing maternal mortality, providing voluntary family planning methods and education enables young women to avoid early pregnancy, allows more girls to attend school longer, makes it possible for women to have fewer, healthier children and helps break the inter-generational cycle of poverty. Additionally, it would reduce HIV transmission, empower women to pursue income-generating activities in their communities and promote environmental sustainability. Focusing on these needs is also a smart investment. There is no better value for the money than international family planning, which provides a higher return on investment than almost any other type of development assistance. Researchers at the Guttmacher Institute have found that providing quality reproductive health care and modern contraceptives to all women who want and need them reduces the cost of maternal and newborn care for each dollar invested, resulting in a net total savings of $1.5 billion. Despite the low cost and many benefits of voluntary family planning, world leaders have not consistently made funding for these programs a priority. The current economic climate has forced Congress to take a long, hard look at its spending and rightly make some tough choices. However, far too often in this debate, the needs of women and children are the first items heaped onto the chopping block. This year's budget discussion has been no exception. Two of the most disturbing and shortsighted of the foreign aid budget cuts are those in funding for international family planning and the U.N. Population Fund. The fund is an agency focused on assisting governments in delivering quality sexual and reproductive health care -- including voluntary family planning -- throughout the life cycle of women across the globe who want and need it. One of the smartest investments I ever made was my $1 billion gift to the United Nations, which led to the creation of the United Nations Foundation. The United Nations is the only institution with the international scale, reach and capacity to address today's toughest challenges. If we want to ensure that we leave our children and grandchildren a safe and healthy world, then it is critical for world leaders to support the U.N.'s vital work on voluntary family planning and reproductive health for women across the globe. The time is now. The investments we make today will shape the world we leave the next generation. If the United States wants to maintain its global leadership role, we must be thinking and making smart investments that will help us address both current and future responsibilities. The best way to do this is to listen to women and fund international family planning. Our future depends on it. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Ted Turner.","Population has tripled in Ted Turner's life and is growing exponentially .

"(CNN) -- Imagine this: Floating in freezing water for 20 hours a day, over seven excruciating days, beneath a 90-meter iceberg which may or may not collapse on you, crushing you to death. Why would anybody to do this? To surf a wave, of course. The man crazy -- or brave -- enough to dream up such a challenge, is Garrett McNamara. The same man who surfed the world's biggest wave -- a 24-meter monster -- off the coast of Portugal in 2011. It would be too easy to describe the 45-year-old American as an ""adrenalin junkie."" Instead, McNamara's addiction to ""the rush,"" as he so frequently describes it, is so all-consuming it's practically the life-giving blood pumping through his veins. It's also the reason the father-of-three risks his life in one of the most dangerous, and jaw-droppingly breathtaking, extreme sports on the planet -- glacier surfing. Glacial gladiator . In 2007, McNamara became the first person to surf a glacier wave -- a wave created when a 75-meter chunk of ice broke off from a massive glacier in Alaska. As the block of ice plummeted into the Copper River, it created a two-meter-high wave which McNamara surfed -- the first and probably only person ever to ride such a swell. ""It was the closest I've ever come to death,"" said the man who has surfed nine-story waves on the most rugged coastlines in the world. ""I was up to my neck in water, looking up at this 90-meter tall glacier, waiting for the ice to break off and hoping that it'll fall straight into the water -- because if it falls flat you'll be squashed under it."" McNamara spent a week camped out at the glacier, spending up to 20 hours a day in the freezing water, waiting for the ice to break off and give him the most exhilarating ride of his life. ""I wanted to go home after the first day,"" McNamara admitted. ""But it's fun to be the first to do something. It's a totally new experience -- no one can tell you what it feels like, what to expect."" Tiny terror . Even as a child growing up in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, McNamara was always testing the boundaries of danger. ""My brothers said I was always the craziest, always pushing buttons,"" he said. ""When I was five-years-old I was jumping off two-story buildings."" When McNamara was 11 years old his family moved to Hawaii, where he replaced his hobby of skateboarding with surfing -- ""From the very first day, I fell in love with it,"" he said. By 17, he was competing in the prestigious Hawaiian Triple Crown and for the next decades traveled the globe as part of the professional surfing circuit. ""I really just want to get beautiful barrels,"" he said. ""You're in your own world. It's a place where time stands still, where all you can hear is your heart beat."" Big wave hunter . Then in the 1990s came one of the most revolutionary developments since the sport began -- tow-surfing. For the first time, surfers could be towed out to the biggest waves in the world with a jet ski -- and McNamara was quick to jump on board. ""Danger is real. But fear is something we create,"" he said. ""We create fear when we think about the future and what could happen -- I'm in the moment."" Watching McNamara in action, a tiny speck skidding down the towering face of a nine-story wave, is enough to make your stomach drop. But he remains almost nonchalant. ""If you look at the statistics, it's a lot more dangerous to ride down a highway than a big wave,"" he said. ""If you don't make the wave, the jet ski will come get you. In 2000 we started using life jackets, so as long as you can hold your breath under water for long enough, you're OK."" Record breaker . It's perhaps that practical attitude which has seen McNamara smash surfing records. In 2011 he rode the biggest wave in the world -- a 24-meter monster in Nazare, Portugal. Earlier this year he returned to the same spot to ride another huge wave, that may have been up to 30 meters high. ""I'm looking for the rush,"" McNamara said. ""But lately I've had a really hard time finding it. ""When I surfed the glacial wave it was mind-bending, it was the heaviest rush. But since that day I've found it difficult to get that rush in the ocean. It made me realize how comfortable I feel on big waves."" McNamara's describes his obsession with that elusive rush as ""like a monkey on my back."" Though he chuckles as he adds: ""I think the monkey's starting to lose his grip.""","Glacier wave surfing: Is this the world's wildest extreme sport?

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabian security forces dispersed and detained dozens of protesters, including women and children, who on Tuesday were urging the government to release political prisoners, according to activists. Mohammed Al-Qahtani, human rights activist and board member of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association, told CNN the demonstration took place in front of the offices of the Human Rights Commission on King Fahd Road in Riyadh, the country's capital. Egyptian protesters call out Morsy . ""These are ongoing protests about political prisoners,"" said Al-Qahtani, who explained that many of the demonstrators were family members of prisoners who had for years been ""languishing in jail cells without due process."" ""The government is not willing to take them to court and issue verdicts,"" added Al-Qahtani, a prominent Saudi activist who is currently on trial in Saudi Arabia accused of, among other things, breaking allegiance to the country's ruler and setting up an unlicensed organization. His case has brought about widespread criticism of the Saudi government by human rights groups. ""These men, women and children were appearing before the Human Rights Commission because no authority (in Saudi Arabia) will listen to their claim and try to provide a solution. That's the root of the problem."" ""The response of the authorities was an exaggerated one,"" he said. ""They also shut down one of the major arteries in the city."" While Tuesday's protest could not be independently verified by CNN, at least one video on YouTube purported to show an argument between demonstrators and police in front of the Human Rights Commission in Riyadh. Crowds in Bangladesh protest unsafe workplaces . Various pictures posted on Twitter also purported to show the demonstrators, some holding signs demanding the release of their relatives. Other pictures appeared to show the small number of protesters surrounded by police. Demonstrations are extremely rare in Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy where protests and gatherings are illegal. CNN has been unable to reach Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry for comment.","Demonstrators seek release of political prisoners held without trial .

"(CNN) -- It may not be an ""Age of Extinction,"" but Hollywood is far from happy with the summer box office. Where are all the blockbusters? Summer is supposed to be Tinseltown's version of the Christmas shopping season, but ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" was the first movie of the year to record a $100 million three-day opening weekend, and overall, the box office is down nearly 20% compared with last year. CNN's complete summer entertainment guide . That comparison is one reason studio executives are reaching for the antacids. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Rentrak, cautions that 2013 is a hard act to follow. ""When you have a film kicking off the summer of 2013 like 'Iron Man 3' with $174.1 million, and this year we kick off the summer with 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' with $91.6 million, that's a pretty big discrepancy,"" Dergarabedian noted. ""Iron Man 3"" wound up grossing $409 million at the domestic box office last year, with ""Despicable Me 2"" adding $368 million. In all, seven films topped the $200 million mark last summer. This summer has seen just three: ""X-Men: Days of Future Past,"" ""Maleficent"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2."" Of course, some things are beyond Hollywood's control, like the calendar. ""Having the Fourth of July actually land on a Friday didn't help things: When you have people outside watching fireworks on the second-biggest moviegoing day of the week, that's not good for business,"" Dergarabedian said. The holiday weekend also featured the latest example of a disturbing trend: the second-weekend slump. Historically, most films don't drop much more than 50% in their sophomore frames, but ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" fell more than 60%. So did ""X-Men: Days of Future Past,"" ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" and ""Godzilla."" That's led to a revolving door of No. 1 movies: ""Transformers"" is the first film of the year to spend more than one weekend as box office champ since ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" in April. 2013 did have a few high-profile, big-budget flops, observes Dergarabedian. Hollywood hasn't suffered through an ""After Earth"" or a ""Lone Ranger"" this year. But plenty of 2014 films have failed to meet expectations, such as the well-reviewed Tom Cruise action flick ""Edge of Tomorrow."" ""It's over $300 million worldwide, so Tom Cruise is still a movie star worldwide, but in North America, even Tom Cruise couldn't get a number one debut,"" as ""Edge"" fell to the teen weeper ""The Fault in Our Stars,"" Dergarabedian recalled. ""How To Train Your Dragon 2"" has also failed to soar as high as expected, despite not much competition for family audiences. Indeed, Dergarabedian says that lack of competition may have reduced the demand for ""Dragon."" ""Moviegoing begets more moviegoing, right? So if you have more product out there, it gets people enthused, it gets families enthused about going out to the movie theater, and when you don't have a lot of family films there, it kind of slows that momentum down,"" he explained. And there's not much relief on the horizon: ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" figures to take over the top spot from ""Transformers"" this weekend, and Dergarabedian sees ""The Purge: Anarchy"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" as other summer bright spots, but none of them figures to help Hollywood dig out of this hole. In fact, the summer movies that have everyone talking are next summer's expected hits: The ""Fantastic Four"" reboot, ""Batman v. Superman,"" ""Fast & Furious 7"" and ""Jurassic World,"" with ""Star Wars: Episode VII"" following in December, have studio execs wishing the calendar read 2015 already. But Dergarabedian hasn't given up on this summer just yet. ""If you put a big movie into the marketplace, market it well, get that buzz going, you can have big box office,"" he said. ""This could all turn around almost overnight. All we need is two or three movies to perform well beyond expectations, and it could turn this around."" Your move, Hollywood. Madison Conklin, special to CNN, contributed to this report.","Summer is usually a time of blockbuster successes, but summer 2014 has seen a shift .

"(CNN) -- While New York police sort out the brawl that left Chris Brown with a nasty cut on his chin early Thursday, the media is left with conflicting details that are mostly be attributed to unnamed sources. It was a ""brutal attack"" that injured Brown, his model girlfriend Karrueche Tran and his bodyguard, Brown rep Jeff Raymond said. ""Chris and his party are cooperating with New York authorities who are pursuing this incident further."" Brown and others in his group have been interviewed by New York police, Brown's spokesman said. A New York Police spokesman confirmed the department was investigating the incident. Brown was partying with friends in the VIP section of the South Village club W.i.P., while the rapper Drake and his friends were nearby, according to statements reps for both artists. Some online reports said the incident began when Drake and Brown argued over Brown's ex-girlfriend Rihanna, whom Brown was convicted of assaulting three years ago. But the confrontation was not about Rihanna, a source close to Brown told CNN. The same source would not confirm if Drake, who has dated Rihanna, was involved. While Drake's rep confirmed the rapper was there, he said ""Drake did not participate in any wrongdoing of any kind last night at W.i.P."" ""He was on his way out of the club when the altercation began,"" Drake's rep told CNN. ""He did not engage in any activity which resulted in injury to person or damage to property."" The source close to Brown described Brown and his party as victims who were enjoying themselves until they were confronted by ""the other party."" They wanted no part of the confrontation and were trying to leave when they were brutally attacked, the source said. Brown's spokesman disputed one online report that someone in Brown's group escalated the confrontation by taunting Drake. ""No one in Chris' camp was inciting the other party,"" he said. Brown posted a photo of his injury -- which appeared to be a half-inch gash on the left corner of his chin -- on his Instagram account. Rihanna on Chris Brown: I'm going to do what I want . Meek Mill, another rapper named in the online reports, also distanced himself from the brawl. While Mill's rep declined comment to CNN, the artist tweeted ""It wasn't me."" Brown, in a tweet of his own Thursday afternoon, appeared to support Meek Mill's claim. ""Me and @MeekMill ain't on that bulls**t. Real respect Real...."" Brown is on probation for another two years, until 2014, the result of his guilty plea to assaulting Rihanna on the eve of the 2009 Grammy Awards. Mark Geragos, the same lawyer who defended Brown in that case, is in New York representing Brown in this incident, the spokesman said. ""Chris is only being viewed as a victim, based on injuries sustained to him, his girlfriend, his friends and his security,"" the spokesman said. ""He is not being viewed as a witness, and certainly not as a suspect."" Previously on CNN: Stars react to Chris Brown, Rihanna .

"(CNN) -- At least 71 people were killed when a parked vehicle exploded at a bus station in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, on Monday morning, Nigerian officials said. Another 133 people were injured in the explosion on the outskirts of the city, national police spokesman Frank Mba said. The attack happened at about 6.45 a.m., as the Nyanya Motor Park bus station was crowded with early morning commuters. One first responder at the scene told CNN ""bodies were scattered everywhere."" ""We're still treating people with injuries and collecting data,"" said Ishaya Isah Chonoko, zone coordinator at the National Emergency Management Agency in Abuja. Information about what caused the blast wasn't immediately available. Charles Otegbade, the emergency management agency's search and rescue chief, said the explosion came from a vehicle that was parked at the station. Interpol, which has offered its assistance to the team investigating the explosion, condemned what it called a ""senseless and cowardly terrorist attack."" ""This slaughter of innocent members of the public will have appalled citizens of all countries,"" the organization's Secretary General Ronald K. Noble said in a statement. ""Interpol condemns this mass murder in the strongest possible terms and we express our solidarity with the people of Nigeria at this difficult time."" No individual or organization has so far come forward to claim responsibility for the blast, but it is believed to bear the hallmarks of Boko Haram, an Islamist militant group that has waged a campaign of violence in Nigeria in recent years. Visiting the scene of the explosion, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan spoke of overcoming the militants. ""The issue of Boko Haram is quite an ugly history within this period of our own development ... but we will get over it,"" he said. ""... The issue of Boko Haram is temporary."" Nigeria's Islamist insurgency has claimed more than 3,000 lives since it began in 2009, according to Human Rights Watch. Boko Haram, which means ""Western education is sacrilege"" in West Africa's Hausa-Fulani language, is fighting for the imposition of stricter Sharia law across the country, and has launched a self-styled ""war on Christians"" in Nigeria. The group is designated a ""terrorist organization"" by the U.S. State Department; . U.N. refugee agencies estimate that more than 8,000 Nigerians have fled into neighboring Cameroon to escape escalating violence sparked by the militants, while another 5,000 have become internally displaced. Until now, Boko Haram's focus has mainly been concentrated on areas of Nigeria's northeast, where the group has launched bomb, gun and arson attacks on homes, schools, markets and even whole villages. But it is not the first time Abuja has been targeted; in 2011 a Boko Haram suicide attack on the United Nations building in the city killed at least 25 people. Security forces in the capital are now said to be on alert after Monday's blast in Abuja raised concerns the insurgency could be spreading further afield. The World Economic Forum is due to meet in Abuja at the beginning of May. Journalist Aminu Abubakar contributed to this report.","Scores killed, at least 124 injured in explosion, police say .

"(CNN) -- King Carlos might be ready to give up his throne but Spain's ""King of Clay"" shows no signs of abdicating any time soon. Rafael Nadal, an eight-time winner at Roland Garros, booked his place in the quarterfinals following a straight sets win over Dusan Lajovic. On the day that King Carlos of Spain renounced the throne following his 40-year reign, Nadal proved his powers to rule on clay were as impressive as ever. Nadal, who will face compatriot and world No.5 David Ferrer for a place in the last four, prevailed 6-1 6-2 6-1 after outclassing his Serbian opponent. The World No.1 is hoping to secure a fifth straight title on the clay in the French capital and remains favorite to do so. But Ferrer defeated Nadal for the first time on clay in 10 years in April -- one of three defeats the reigning champion suffered in the lead-up to the French Open. ""I think that I am playing a little bit better than when I was playing against him in Monte-Carlo, but I think he's playing great, too,"" Nadal told the ATP website. ""He played three weeks in a row at a very high level. In Madrid he played great, in Rome he played great, and he's playing great here. ""He's coming to the match with confidence and with confidence that he beat me the last time. It will be a tough one. I know how to play against him and to have chances to win I need to play very well. That's what I'm going to try. If not, it will be impossible."" Ferrer, who was beaten by Nadal in last year's final, overcame South Africa's Kevin Anderson to reach the last eight. Ferrer took the first two sets 6-3 6-3 before Anderson fought back to take the third on a tie-break. But the 32-year-old powered home, taking the fourth 6-1 to reach his 10th successive Grand Slam quarter-final. ""I will try to do my best,"" Ferrer told the ATP website. ""I will try to play aggressively with my forehand and try to finish the points at the net. But of course it's going to be difficult with Rafael on a clay court. ""Tactically, I will have to be perfect. I hope that I will instill some doubts in Rafa's mind, but if we play at our best level, both of us, he will be the better player. ""So I will pull out all the stops to play well without making errors, and we'll see what's going to happen."" Last year, Ferrer was soundly beaten in his first grand slam final by Nadal, 6-3 6-2 6-3. But he is adamant that he is better equipped to deal with the pressure which comes with taking on the very best. He added: ""I was very nervous (last year in the final). I was jittery. It was a little bit too much for me. But now I'm calmer, I've had time to adapt. ""I think that I will be calmer, more serene, but I don't know exactly what will be my state of mind when I play against Rafa. I won't think about the final that took place last year."" Elsewhere, Andy Murray set up a tantalizing tie against home favorite Gael Monfils. Murray, who has now reached 13 successive grand slam quarterfinals, defeated Spain's Fernando Verdasco 6-4 7-5 7-6. The World No.6, who survived a five-set epic in the previous round against Philipp Kohlschreiber Sunday, showed little sign of fatigue with an impressive showing. He will now face Frenchman Monfils, who overcame the challenge of Guillermo Garcia-Lopez in straight sets 6-0 6-2 7-5. ""I have known Gael since I was 10 and he was 11,"" Murray said in his post-match interview. ""He is an unbelievable entertainer, a great athlete, a very nice guy and it should be a very tough match, but there should be some fun points because of the way we both play."" In the women's draw, Romania's Simona Halep booked her place in the last eight with a 6-4 6-3 win over U.S. star Sloane Stephens. Halep will now take on 2009 winner Svetlana Kuznetsova, who defeated Lucie Safarova 6-3 6-4. Germany's Andrea Petkovic reached her first grand slam quarterfinal for the first time in three years with a 1-6 6-2 7-5 win over Dutch qualifier Kiki Bertens. She will now face Sara Errani, who defeated sixth seed Jelena Jankovic, 7-5, 6-2. ""It was super tough, because I didn't know her at all,"" Petkovic told reporters of her opponent, Bertens. ""I just stalked her on YouTube yesterday the whole day, and I was already impressed yesterday. ""I think she's going to be a force on the WTA when she gets fitter and recovers from her injuries that she's had.""","Rafael Nadal books his place in quarterfinals of French Open .

Witnesses reported seeing a plane circle over the Upper New York Bay near the Statue of Liberty. The review will focus on ""why that decision was made and to ensure that it never happens again,"" Gibbs said. Jim Messina, a deputy chief of staff, will lead the effort. On Tuesday, Obama told reporters, ""It was a mistake. It was something we found out about along with all of you. And it will not happen again."" Officials said that when Obama first found out about the incident, he was ""furious."" The incident has led to a large amount of criticism from New Yorkers and politicians. After a YouTube video showed panicked New Yorkers scrambling as the plane flew frighteningly close to the lower Manhattan skyline, a former Homeland Security adviser questioned whether the man who approved the flyby should remain in his White House office. Fran Townsend, who advised President George W. Bush for more than three years, called the move ""crass insensitivity"" in the wake of 9/11. ""I'd call this felony stupidity. This is probably not the right job for Mr. Caldera to be in if he didn't understand the likely reaction of New Yorkers, of the mayor,"" Townsend said Tuesday on CNN's ""American Morning."" Louis Caldera, director of the White House Military Office, quickly apologized for Monday's incident after the planes prompted workers and residents to evacuate buildings in New York and New Jersey.  Watch Townsend slam Caldera » . ""Last week, I approved a mission over New York. I take responsibility for that decision,"" Caldera said. ""While federal authorities took the proper steps to notify state and local authorities in New York and New Jersey, it's clear that the mission created confusion and disruption."" The Federal Aviation Administration said the aircraft, which functions as Air Force One when the president is aboard, was taking part in a classified, government-sanctioned photo shoot. On Tuesday Sen. John McCain wrote a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates saying he was ""profoundly disturbed"" by the flyover ""against the backdrop of September 11."" ""The supposed mission represents a fundamentally unsound exercise in military judgment and may have constituted an inappropriate use of Department of Defense resources,"" McCain, a ranking member of the Senate's Armed Services Committee, wrote in the letter. He requested an investigation into the cost of the flyover. Air Force officials estimate that the mission and the photo shoot for the 747 and an accompanying F-16 fighter jet cost $328,835. But they said ""the hours would have been flown regardless, and the expenses would have been accrued on a different mission."" An Air Force source told CNN on Tuesday that the White House Military Office planned a photo shoot over various Washington monuments next week, but the shoot has now been canceled. An angry Mayor Michael Bloomberg said it ""defies the imagination"" that an agency would schedule the photo shoot so near the site of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, said the FAA's decision to not announce the flyby ""borders on being either cruel or very, very stupid.""

The YouTube video shows dozens of people standing in a parking lot, watching the plane approach. As it nears, they begin to run. Someone unleashes an expletive. ""Run, run!"" says one person. ""Oh my God,"" cries another. A 911 call released by the Hudson County Sheriff's Department in New Jersey shows the panic caused by the plane. ""There's a plane falling, there is a big aircraft falling like 9/11,"" a man says to the operator. ""Everybody is running and people are crying and panicking."" Two officials said the White House Military Office was trying to update its file photos of Air Force One. Bloomberg said he was perturbed.  Watch the White House apologize » . ""I'm annoyed -- furious is a better word -- that I wasn't told,"" he said, calling the FAA's decision to withhold details about the flight ""ridiculous"" and ""poor judgment.""

Garcia-Rose said she is considering filing a class-action suit against the government for sanctioning the plane's unannounced flight. ""I believe the government has done something really wrong,"" she said. Capt.

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, April 2, the United States Supreme Court ruled that any cap on the overall amount a person can spend to influence an election is unconstitutional. Following on the heels of the court's previous decision in Citizens United, the McCutcheon ruling will allow unlimited spending to influence our nation's political process. In the words of Justice Stephen Breyer, who wrote the dissent in the McCutcheon case, the ruling ""eviscerates our nation's campaign finance laws, leaving a remnant incapable of dealing with the grave problems of democratic legitimacy that those laws were intended to resolve."" You shouldn't need money or connections to get a fair shake in our justice system. That's the very essence of our American creed. And yet we know that even with previous restrictions, money had a corrupting influence on our democracy. A Federal Election Survey found that 82% of Americans were worried about special interests buying elections. Three in five Americans thought Congress was already more likely to vote in ways that please their financial supporters, while only one in five Americans thought Congress votes in the best interest of constituents. Several studies find money gives you access to members of Congress and their staff: Contributors have disproportionately better access. And these studies were conducted before the McCutcheon decision, when the total donations to candidates, parties or PACs within an election cycle were still limited at a whopping $123,000. This decision benefits those who have that kind of money, not the everyday campaign contributor. The court upheld the law that puts a $5,200 cap on conventional individual contributions to a single candidate. But without the $123,000 overall limit, imagine how much worse it will be when a single wealthy donor can contribute $3.5 million to a political party and its candidates. What we have politely called ""influence"" up until now will become nothing short of bribery. It's hard enough to get the people's will through Congress as is. As is, 90% of Americans want stronger gun safety laws and yet gun-industry political contributions hobble legislative momentum. And 72% of voters want to raise the minimum wage -- including a majority of Republicans -- but campaign spending and lobbying by the low-wage fast food and retail industry is stymieing progress in Congress there as well. More than half of Americans want the federal government to limit power plant emissions and take other steps to curb climate change, moves opposed by the wealthy â€” and politically generous â€” oil and gas industry. On issue after issue after issue, the will of the American people is already up against the often-insurmountable obstacles created by well-heeled corporations armed with campaign contributions. And now it's just going to get worse. An analysis by the organization Demos found that the McCutcheon ruling could release more than $1 billion in additional election spending from wealthy donors through 2020. The community activist group CREDO Action has launched a campaign to send NASCAR-like judge robes covered in corporate sponsorship logos to the five Supreme Court justices who voted for Citizens United and now the McCutcheon decision. Instead of protecting the marginalized and disenfranchised in America, the five conservative justices have manipulated our Constitution to create new rights and give even more power to our nation's wealthiest individuals and corporations. In 1816, Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""I hope that we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations, which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength, and bid defiance to the laws of our country."" But rather, thanks in part to the Supreme Court ruling in McCutcheon, it is now we the people who have been definitively crushed. As has our democracy.","U.S. Supreme Court rules cap on aggregate amount of election donations is unconstitutional .

"(CNN) -- When Oculus, makers of a virtual-reality headset many view as the future of video gaming, agreed in March to a $2 billion buyout by Facebook, they weren't tempted by the success of ""FarmVille"" or ""Candy Crush."" Instead, they eyed the 1.2 billion people who use Facebook every month, with dreams of dropping most of them together into a new, virtual world. ""With Oculus ... if you're putting on this pair of glasses and you're going to be face-to-face communicating with people and you're going to be jumping in and out of this new set of virtual worlds, this was going to be the largest MMO (massively multiuser online community) ever made,"" Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe said Monday at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in New York. ""This is going to be an MMO where we want to put a billion people in virtual reality, and a billion-person virtual-world MMO is going to require a bigger network than exists today. Why not start with Facebook and their infrastructure and their team and talent that they've built up?"" Designed by a team with strong roots in the video-gaming world, the Oculus Rift is a headset that provides a 360-degree field of vision, allowing wearers to view, and react to, their surroundings in a realistic manner. Created by 20-year-old Palmer Luckey, Oculus first turned heads in 2012 when it went to Kickstarter in hopes of making enough money to continue development and ended up raking in nearly $2.5 million. Gaming legend John Carmack, the lead programmer of pioneering games such as ""Doom"" and ""Quake,"" has since come on board, and the headset has been hailed by many, including CNN and Time, as one of the top inventions in recent years. But when Oculus sold to Facebook, many in the gaming community were surprised. If they were going to sell, why not to Microsoft, Sony or Nintendo, the gaming world's major players? Iribe said it was all about escaping limitations. ""We're very committed to gaming. But do we want to be Game Boy or do we want to be iPhone or Android?"" he said, referring to Nintendo's now-defunct handheld gaming device. ""I think Game Boy was an awesome platform, but I think you'll see handheld game devices largely disrupted by the mobile market and mobile devices."" Since developer kits began shipping in spring 2013, Oculus has continued to add to the roster of companies hoping to create content for its system. The process heated up even more in the wake of the Facebook deal, Iribe said, when some of the gaming world's top names jumped in, seemingly reassured that investing time in development would pay off in the long run. But he says it would be a mistake to limit Oculus to gaming. ""We started off with a big focus on gaming, which we still have -- we're all former game developers,"" he said. ""Then, looking at where vision and VR is going to go in the next 10 years, it's going to be a lot about face-to-face communication and social. ""A number of people ... have said this is going to be the most social platform of all time."" Thus far, Facebook seems satisfied to bring Oculus into the family and then largely allow it to continue doing its own thing. That's the model Facebook has employed with Instagram and WhatsApp, other successful startups it snapped up in recent years. Facebook's $19 billion move you might not notice . Iribe said many within Oculus were leery of being taken over by anyone, and that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg specifically mentioned Instagram and WhatsApp as examples of how the relationship would work. ""You can use any part of Facebook, or not; it's up to you guys,"" Iribe said he was told. ""You now just have one of the biggest networks in the world behind you."" He also teased a mind-blowing new generation of virtual reality coming in the future from Oculus that will challenge our perception of what's real and what's not. ""This avatar you're looking at, your brain will be convinced it's a person, because it is,"" he said. ""It's just the virtual representation of a person ... (but) you'll be there going, 'I know that's you. It doesn't quite look like you -- you're a cartoon or you've changed your hair -- but I can tell it's you.' And your brain will be convinced.""","Oculus CEO: We want a virtual-reality world with 1 billion people in it .

"(Time.com) -- When Samsung's Galaxy Note smartphone went on sale in the U.S. in February, two things made it, um, noteworthy. At 5.3â€³, its display was the largest one ever offered on a phone. And the Note came with Samsung's S Pen, a precision stylus which let you jot notes and sketch pictures without jabbing at the screen with your finger. Let's face it, though -- that humongous screen completely overshadowed the S Pen. Everyone had a strong opinion about it. Many people found the notion of a phone with a screen that edges in on tablet territory alluring: Samsung says it's shipped ten million Galaxy Notes to date. Others, however, considered that same notion to be comical rather than practical. (Held to the ear, the jumbo-sized Note tends to throw off proportions and make it look like your skull has shrunk by a size or two.) Now Samsung is releasing its second Galaxy Note device, the Galaxy Note 10.1, which goes on sale in the U.S. Thursday. This Note, unlike its smartphone sibling, shouldn't be an object of controversy. The 12 Best Android Widgets for 2012 . There's nothing startling about its form factor: It's an Android tablet with a 10.1â€³ display, a size that's comfortably familiar in the Android world, and not radically dissimilar from the 9.7-incher on Apple's iPad. But it's a solid, straightforward Android tablet that comes with an S Pen, a suite of pen-friendly apps and some productivity-oriented software enhancements which give it a more businesslike flavor than Samsung's Galaxy Tab 2 10.1. The Galaxy Note 10.1 with 16GB of storage lists for $499, the same price as a 16GB iPad. But the 32GB Galaxy Note is $549, $50 less than a 32GB iPad. And while there's no 64GB model, the tablet's microSD slot lets you add a 32GB memory card for $20 or less, bringing capacity up to 64GB for a grand total of about $570 -- a steep discount off the 64GB iPad's $699 sticker price. Both the 16GB and 32GB variants offer wi-fi but no cellular option and come with 50GB of Dropbox online storage for two years. If the Note 10.1 sells well, it won't be on the strength of the bang it delivers for your buck. It'll be because it's one of the relatively few Android tablets with a snappy answer to the bottom-line question ""Why should somebody buy this instead of an iPad?"" The iPad doesn't come with a pen and may never do so, given Steve Jobs' famous declaration that ""if you see a stylus, they blew it."" Scads of companies have stepped in to fill the gap -- my favorite iPad stylus is Adonit's Jot Flip -- but all of their designs suffer from the fact that they're designed to work with a tablet that was engineered for fingertips. Samsung, however, built the Galaxy Note 10.1 from the ground up for pen use. And when it decided to add pens to some of its devices, it made the eminently sensible decision to work with Wacom, the company which dominates the market for graphics tablets used by artists. The S Pen, which stows in a slot on tablet's side when not in use, is based on Wacom's technology. That means that it's pressure-sensitive and extremely precise, and doesn't use a battery. Using it feels like writing with a slightly stubby ballpoint; Samsung also sells a larger pen, as well as one with an ""eraser"" on the opposite end from the nib. Tech companies make progress on 'blood phones' Android doesn't come with any apps meant expressly for pen use. So Samsung created some of its own, including S Note, a highly capable note-taking program which lets you write and draw on simulated lined pages, graph paper and blank sheets. You can use a fine-line pen, a pencil, a paintbrush or a highlighter; pressure sensitivity lets you vary your pen strokes or lay down a thicker coat of paint by pressing harder. S Note can also convert your block-letter or cursive input into editable text. It did a surprisingly accurate job of deciphering my chicken scratchings. But as with every other device I've ever used with handwriting recognition, the payoff didn't seem worth the effort required: You need to write words a few at a time, then pause while the tablet interprets them. Except for brief notes, if you want to see your words in a crisp, legible typeface rather than your own handwriting, you're probably best off using the on-screen keyboard. (Samsung sells a case, obviously inspired by the iPad's Smart Cover, which lets you angle the tablet for comfy typing.) Unlike the iPad, the Galaxy Note 10.1 is designed to let you rest your palm on the screen as you write or draw without getting confused by the fact that two parts of your hand are in contact with the display at once. Despite this, I found myself occasionally triggering actions unintentionally as I worked. I suspect that the fact I'm a southpaw doesn't help: When I begin to write on the left-hand side of the screen, my palm rests on top of Android's on-screen buttons for tasks such as going back one screen and returning to the home screen. A righty's palm would fall in a less critical spot. The S Pen works in other apps besides S Note, of course. I liked using it to crop photos and perform touch-up work in Photoshop Touch, which Samsung throws in for free. The tablet includes a program that points you towards pen-friendly programs in Google's Play store; most of the ones I tried didn't support pressure sensitivity, but the S Pen is still a plus in any program that involves handwritten note-taking, sketching or any gesture that's tough to perform accurately with a fingertip. Pen aside, this is one of the best big-screen Android tablets I've tried, a nicely-styled 1.3-pound package that's a skosh lighter than an iPad and doesn't look too much like an iPad clone. (Samsung, presumably, would like to minimize the future time it spends squabbling with Apple in court.) Trial gives sneak peek into Apple's inner workings .","On the Saumsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet, the stylus pen is the key .

"(CNN) -- At work one day, IT consultant Justin Shelton suddenly began to feel ill. A few hours later, he was in the emergency room, and doctors told him he might have a kidney infection. They just needed to run a scan to confirm the diagnosis. The next words were a cold reality check: The imaging machine could not support his weight. ""They told me, 'We think you have a kidney infection, but we can't confirm for sure, so we're just going to treat it aggressively and hope that's what it is,' "" Shelton said. He was 25 years old and weighed 592 pounds. Two years earlier, Justin's wife, Lauren Shelton, had had her own medical scare; her gallbladder had to be removed because of weight-related complications. At her heaviest, Lauren weighed 341 pounds. Their size made everyday tasks difficult, too. Years ago, Lauren was on a plane, and the seat belt wouldn't buckle. She was mortified and tried to hide from the flight attendants that she didn't fit into the seat. Both Lauren and Justin had been asked not to get on rides at a theme park because of their size. But Justin's trip to the emergency room was the final straw. The Jefferson City, Tennessee, couple realized something needed to change. Luckily for Justin, doctors were right and able to treat his kidney infection without the scan. ""It made me think, 'What if it was something else? What if it was more serious? What would I have done then?' "" Justin said. So in February 2012, the couple began a 19-month journey to take control of their health. Early struggles . ""I was always bigger than the other kids, but the pounds really started packing on during high school and continued to do so over the next several years,"" Lauren wrote on her blog, OvercomingO.com. For Justin, it was a knee injury at age 13 that kept him from playing sports. The exercise went away, bad eating habits continued, and his weight got out of control. The Sheltons met online seven years ago, and their relationship revolved around their eating habits. They would go out to eat and indulge in one unhealthy meal after another. They knew that in order to get healthy, they needed someone to steer them in the right direction. So they sought help from a weight-loss management program at a local medical school. A physician's assistant gave them guidelines on what they should and should not be eating, and on the amount of exercise they needed. Justin and Lauren started their new exercise routine by doing simple activities such as walking around the park and swimming. In late 2012, they joined a gym. ""We go to the gym five to six days a week and take one day off and try to do something fun and active like hiking or swimming,"" Lauren said. The couple also started using a smartphone app to track the calories they consumed. In the beginning, they ate at restaurants only on special occasions and prepared all meals at home. Lauren found recipes for healthier versions of the foods they loved. Their diet primarily consists of lean meats with lots of fruits and vegetables. Even today, everything they eat goes into a food journal. The weight came off quickly at the beginning. Justin lost 25 pounds and Lauren lost 30 pounds during the first month alone. They tried to keep the weight loss steady after that, knowing they couldn't expect to see such a big number month after month without being disappointed. Weekly weigh-ins helped them track their progress. ""We have graphs that show our weight loss through an app. It helps us stay motivated and get through the hard weeks,"" Justin said. In just 19 months, Justin dropped 362 pounds and Lauren lost 176, for a total of 538 pounds. 'Nobody is perfect' As they begin to move into the maintenance phase of their diet, the couple has allowed themselves to indulge once in a while. They now have what they call their Special Sunday Meal, where they will cook something they don't typically have during the week. ""This Sunday, we may have grilled turkey burgers on a whole-wheat bun with some oven-baked potatoes,"" Lauren said. ""Typically, we do not have starches very often and do not keep breads in the house."" They still give in to cravings from time to time. Lauren says she has a sweet tooth, but she controls cravings by distracting herself with activities such as walks or naps. What keeps her on track is understanding that ""No matter how many times you slipped or messed up, you just have to start over, and eventually you'll get there,"" she said. ""You have to stay positive and remind yourself that you're human and nobody is perfect."" Even though they've managed to lose a substantial amount of weight -- Lauren went from a size 32 dress to a size 12, and Justin went from size 58 pants to a size 36 -- the couple struggles with the psychological side effects of such a massive physical change. Self-image has been an obstacle for both Lauren and Justin. They admit to having moments when they still see themselves as the obese people they used to be. ""I don't see myself as quite as small as what the pictures show or people tell us we look like,"" Lauren said. Through both the struggles and triumphs they have found support in each other. They say that doing this as a team has brought them closer together, and they feel like they are almost newlyweds again. Recently, Lauren and Justin traveled on a plane and were thrilled to find they could not only buckle their seat belts but needed to tighten them. They also returned to the theme park and rode the rides with no problems at all. ""It was kind of triumphant,"" Justin said. ""We are a lot more adventurous and outgoing. Our outlook has changed almost completely."" Have you lost weight? Share your story on iReport .","Lauren and Justin Shelton lost a combined 538 pounds in 19 months .

"Washington (CNN) -- Nearly three-quarters of all Americans think Tibet should be an independent country, according to a new national poll. However, the CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Thursday also indicates that most Americans think it is more important to maintain good relations with China than to take a stand on Tibet. The poll's release came as President Obama was to meet with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader in exile, at the White House. The Dalai Lama is popular with Americans, according to the survey, with 56 percent holding a favorable view of him and only 18 percent having an unfavorable impression. ""That puts him in the same neighborhood as other major religious figures,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""Favorable ratings for the pope, at 59 percent, and Billy Graham, at 57 percent, are virtually identical to the numbers for the Dalai Lama."" The poll also indicates that 53 percent say it's more important for the United States to take a strong stand on human rights in China than to maintain good relations with Beijing, with 44 percent saying good relations are more important. Analysis: Meeting could hurt relations with China . By a 6-point margin, the survey also shows that more Americans say taking a strong stand on Taiwan by force is more important than maintaining good relations with Beijing. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted February 12-15, with 1,023 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall survey.

"(CNN) -- On ABC, Thursdays now officially belong to Shonda Rhimes. As the creator of flagship ABC programs ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Scandal,"" Rhimes has already carved out a two-hour block on Thursdays with those two dramas. But this fall, ABC will air three of Rhimes' shows -- which she co-produces with Betsy Beers -- all in a row. The network, which announced its 2014-2015 lineup Tuesday, has slated ""Grey's Anatomy"" for the 8 p.m. hour on Thursdays, to be followed by ""Scandal"" at 9 p.m. and Rhimes' new drama, ""How to Get Away with Murder,"" at 10 p.m. The series is set in a law school and stars Viola Davis as the ""brilliant, charismatic and seductive"" professor of a criminal law class she dubs ""How to Get Away with Murder."" When Davis' professor becomes involved with four students from her class, the lawyers-in-training realize they have to apply what they've learned to real life. In addition to that series, ABC is adding five other new programs to its fall lineup, four of which are comedies. The president of ABC's Entertainment Group, Paul Lee, said in a statement that the network has made an effort to reflect the U.S.'s diversity with its new schedule.

"(CNN) -- The Justice Department targeted American Muslims in ""abusive counterterrorism sting operations"" as part of aggressive terror investigations, an international human rights group alleges. Human Rights Watch claimed in a report on Monday that it examined dozens of cases from investigation through prosecution, and found many defendants would never have committed a crime ""if not for law enforcement encouraging, pressuring, and sometimes paying them to commit terrorist acts."" It alleges the FBI targeted people who did not appear to have any involvement in terror plots or related financing when the government began investigating them. The FBI went after particularly vulnerable people, including those with intellectual and mental disabilities and the indigent, according to Andrea Prasow, deputy Washington director of Human Rights Watch and co-author of the report. The Justice Department said the group's conclusions weren't accurate. The federal government has prosecuted more than 500 terrorism-related cases since the September, 11, 2001, al Qaeda hijack attacks on the United States. The report was based on more than 215 interviews with defendants, family members, attorneys, judges, current and former prosecutors and other experts. It specifically cited 27 cases. In one example, a Boston-area man, Rezwan Ferdaus, pleaded guilty in 2012 and was sentenced to 17 years in prison for plotting to attack the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol with model planes packed with explosives. Human Rights Watch claimed the FBI targeted Ferdaus ""even though his mental health was deteriorating significantly during the time"" he was under investigation. The report said his father had to quit work to look after him. ""That didn't stop the FBI from pursuing a case by sending an informant in to work with Ferdaus and eventually help him develop a plot to attack"" the Capitol, the group said. The Justice Department said it has followed the law. ""The Department of Justice has been a steadfast ally of our nation's civil rights groups for decades. The report itself acknowledges that many of the decisions that the report criticizes are not only lawful but also specifically approved by federal judges, just as the material support statute that the report criticizes was upheld as constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. We do not and cannot target individuals solely for engaging in activities protected by the First Amendment, which includes free speech and religion,"" said spokesman Marc Raimondi.","Human Rights Watch says Justice Department target American Muslims .

"(CNN) -- A court in Mumbai on Thursday found four men guilty of gang-raping a photojournalist in the Indian city last year. The woman, who was 22 at the time, and a male colleague were on assignment in the area for a print publication in August when some men approached them, according to police. The two had walked from a train station to a nearby mill, the woman said in a statement released by police. One of the men claimed to be a railway employee and said, ""Our boss has seen you taking photos; you will have to come with us."" According to the woman, he refused to let her talk to his boss, instead leading them away. Then, somewhere near the exit, one of the accused pointed at the photojournalist's colleague, saying he was responsible for a killing a few days ago. Sexual harassment in India: 'The story you never wanted to hear' ""I pleaded with them to let us go, but they shouted at me and threatened me,"" the woman said. She and her colleague were taken further inside the mill complex. There, they offered their camera and phone, begging to be let go. Instead, ""they tied my friend's hands with (a) belt"" as two others joined the group, the woman said. ""Three people stayed with my friend, and the two took me behind a wall,"" she added. That's where the attack allegedly occurred. The victim said her mother called her phone multiple times, before one of the men switched it off. The woman said she was threatened with, among other things, sharp pieces of a broken beer bottle. A fifth suspect who was arrested in connection with the case -- believed to be a teenager -- will be tried separately in a juvenile court. The four men will be sentenced on Friday.

"(CNN) -- More violence from suspected al Qaeda militants in Yemen continued Sunday in two separate attacks. At least 13 Yemeni soldiers were killed and nine others were injured when the militants ambushed a military police headquarters in the southern Yemeni province of Hadramout, two Interior Ministry officials told CNN. The attackers ""easily escaped,"" said Ali BaNajjar, who witnessed the ambush in Hadramout. A second attack occurred close to a checkpoint near the Yemeni presidential palace in the capital, Sanaa, according the government officials. Several militants were killed, said Mohammed al-Qayedi, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. It's not the first time militants have targeted Sanaa security forces. On Friday, nearly 20 gunmen attacked the political security headquarters in the capital and killed four troops and injured at least four others at a checkpoint. Three attackers were killed, while the others fled unharmed. The violence seems in line with a promise a senior al Qaeda operative made last week -- that the organization was going to bring bloodshed to Sanaa. Al Qaeda appears to be making good on its threat, one Yemen-based analyst told CNN. ""After al Qaeda threatened to move the fight to the main cities, attacks against foreigners and Yemeni forces in Sanaa more than tripled compar(ed) to a month before,"" said AbdulSalam Mohammed, president of the Sanaa-based Abaad Strategic Center. ""Troops need to be on high alert if they have a chance to defeat the militants."" The Defense Ministry Sunday said that tens of al-Qaeda militants were killed over the last two days, among them many foreign fighters. On Saturday, CNN reported that a Yemeni government official said two al Qaeda gunmen tried to kidnap two U.S. Embassy workers on April 24. The attackers were part of the terrorist group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, the official said. The shooting that stopped them happened near a Yemeni barbershop ""where many foreigners and diplomats go to get their hair cut,"" the Yemeni official said. Of all al Qaeda-affiliated networks worldwide, AQAP is considered the most dangerous threat to Americans. The two U.S. Embassy personnel were apparently not supposed to be near the barbershop, the official said. ""These individuals violated security protocol,"" the Yemeni official said. ""U.S. Embassy personnel are not allowed to leave their secure facilities. The American who shot the kidnappers had a gun permit and was authorized to carry a gun. The two armed kidnappers were AQAP militants. They weren't unarmed civilians."" Marie Harf, deputy spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, confirmed the incident in a statement. ""Two U.S. Embassy officers in Yemen fired their weapons after being confronted by armed individuals in an attempted kidnapping at a small commercial business in Sanaa,"" the statement read. ""Two of the armed individuals were killed. The Embassy officers are no longer in Yemen."" The revelation of the incident comes after the U.S. Embassy in Yemen was closed indefinitely Wednesday amid security concerns and as fighting between security forces and AQAP intensified. Just days before the abduction attempt, a joint U.S.-Yemeni operation was being carried out against AQAP in the Abyan and Shabwa regions of Yemen. Authorities did not disclose whether drones were used in the strikes. The use of the unmanned drones has stirred controversy because the drones have killed civilians, a high-level Yemeni official has said. A top Yemeni Interior Ministry official said the U.S. government had considered closing the embassy two weeks ago, as attacks on foreigners intensified. The violence near the barbershop, and violence against other foreigners in the past six weeks, persuaded Americans to close down the U.S. Embassy this past week, the official said. Hakim Almasmari reported from Yemen. CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: Suspected al Qaeda militants staged two attacks in Yemen Sunday .
