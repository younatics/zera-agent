"By . David Mccormack . Emergency crews were called to a Pittsburgh apartment on Monday morning after neighbors complained about smelling natural gas and the owner is blaming his cat. Patrick Bookout left his pet, Bugera, home alone for the weekend. He estimates that at some point  the feline must have hit a burner knob with his paw when he climbed onto the stove looking for food. Fortunately nobody was hurt after Bookout's upstairs neighbors smelled the gas and called 911 on Monday morning. Patrick Bookout is blaming his cat, Bugera, after neighbors complained about smelling natural gas and called emergency services to his Pittsburgh apartment on Monday morning . ‘He runs out of food because he’s a little piggy and he hops up on the fridge. When he jumps up, he has to hit the stove, he hits the burner and it’s on,’ Bookout told KDKA. Bookout says he wasn’t surprised to hear about the smell of gas in the building when he returned home on Monday morning, since it isn’t the first time that his mischievous cat has turned a burner on. ‘It was only a couple months ago I came home from work and the burner on my stove was on,’ he said. 'Now the arson department is at my house, and my cat’s the culprit.' Arson investigators were checking out the incident. Patrick Bookout left Bugera home alone in his ground floor flat for the weekend and he estimates that at some point the feline must have hit a burner knob with his paw while looking for food . According to Bookout, he is going to make some changes inside the apartment to ensure it doesn’t happen again. 'I’m going to take the handle off the stove, and probably leave him outside every day I’m not home,' he said. Bugera was a stray before Bookout offered him a home.

"By . Jill Reilly . Ten children is a sizable brood for any set of parents, but it is particularly astounding in a country with a one child per family policy. Liu Xiangying, 58, and his wife Yi Mamei, 40, have five daughters and five sons. The pair, who have been married 22 years, have nine more children than the law allows in China because they did not know about contraception. Ten children is a sizable brood for any set of parents, but it is particularly astounding in a country with a one child per family policy. Pictured: Yi Mamei, 40, and five of her children .

Liu Cheng, 13, holds his newborn twin sisters  at their home in Chefang township in east China's Jiangsu province . Liu Chang, 7, and Liu Jian, 4, pose for a photo in their small hut . The family, who are uneducated and poor, live in a hut in Chefang township in east China's Jiangsu province and do not have any contact with authorities. The couple's eldest children are two girls, 22-year-old Liu Huan and 16-year-old Liu Min. They have a son, Liu Cheng, 13, a daughter, Liu Xiaoxiao, 11, and another two sons, Liu Peng,10, and Liu Chang, 7. Liu Xiaoxiao, 11, in the family's home. According to the couple, they will 'adopt measures' to avoid pregnancy in the future . The family have a small one bedroom flat. The owner of the building also rents out a shed at the end of the garden where the rest of the family are housed . China is preparing for two million extra babies a year as a result of a loosening of its 'one child' birth limits that will allow more couples to have two children. The ruling Communist Party introduced birth limits in 1980 to curb population growth and demand for water and other resources. Most urban couples are allowed one child and face fines and other penalties for additional births. Pressure to enforce limits has led local officials to force women to abort fetuses or to be sterilized, even though such measures are illegal. The party announced in November that couples in which one parent was an only child would be allowed to have a second baby in some areas. Previously, both parents had to be an only child to qualify for this exemption. Local authorities have been told to build more health facilities for women and children and add maternity beds, said Zhang Shikun, an official with the commission in charge of women and children's health. The figure of two million additional births is at the top end of forecasts by experts based on the less restrictive policy. Some say the figure might be lower due to the growing acceptance in China of smaller families. The looser policy has taken effect in the cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing, and the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Sichuan, Guangdong and Jiangsu. There are two younger boys, Liu Zhuang, 5 and  Liu Jian, 4, as well as newly born twin sisters. The seventh child, a boy, Liu Zhuang drowned at the age of five, and his mother says she cries every day at the loss. They have a small one bedroom flat where some of the family live. The owner of the building also rents out a shed at the end of the garden where the rest of the family are housed. But now their future is in jeopardy because Liu  has fallen ill. When . he sought medical treatment the authorities learned of their large . family which breaches the strict one child only law in place across the . country. Until now Liu has made a living by collecting and selling garbage. Now he has become ill, three of the children have had to leave their education due to a lack of money. Chinese communist party officials say they have not yet decided whether the couple will be punished. But for father Liu, the lack of a welfare network now he has been taken ill is punishment enough: 'I don't know how I am going to feed my family. 'I talked with my wife about offering some of them for adoptions but we can't bear to be parted from them, we love them too much.' Doctors say they don't know when the Liu will be back on his feet, saying: 'He is worn out, ten children to feed and no break in what is a seven days a week job, year in and year out.' According to the couple, they will 'adopt measures' to avoid pregnancy in the future.

"By . Snejana Farberov . 0 . If New York City could transform an abandoned railway into a beloved park, why can't Philadelphia? That is what landscaper and Philadelphia history buff  Peter VanMeter asked himself in 2010 when he founded VIADUCTgreene, an organization dedicated to raising awareness of a blighted three-mile stretch of train tracks slicing through the heart of the City of Brotherly Love. The idea was to transform the vast, long-defunct Reading Viaduct covering 55 city blocks, encompassing both elevated and submerged portions, into a lush green space on the model of New York City's famed High Line - a one-mile elevated track on the lower west side. Scroll down for video . Waiting for change: In the heart of Philadelphia, three miles of abandoned tracks are waiting to be turned into a park . Seeing green: The group Friends of the Rail Park advocate for turning a railroad covering 55 city blocks into a green space with park benches and bike paths . A mid-19th century Philadelpha and Reading Railroad map showing the inner-city railroad . Nature lovers: In this Oct. 6, 2011 photo, Sarah McEneaney, left, leads a group along train tracks on a Reading Railroad Viaduct no longer in use in Philadelphia . VanMeter, who passed away earlier this year, led a regular semi-legal tour of the derelict Viaduct that took urban explorers on an adventure along 19th century train tracks lurking above and below Philadelphia’s busy streets. For nearly a century beginning in 1890, the Reading Viaduct carried trains laden with goods into Central Philadelphia. At the height of the American Industrial Revolution, the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, which owned the tracks, was considered the largest company in the world. But in early 1980s, the railroad folded following a bankruptcy. Philadelphia’s once-celebrated railway made up of two parts - the City Brunch tunnel and the Reading Viaduct – has stood abandoned for the past two decades. In 2003, a study commissioned by the City of Philadelphia found that demolishing the Viaduct would cost 10 times more than turning the space into a park. Developing the derelict railway into a green space with bike paths, landscaping, benches and staircases for public access would set the city back $5.1million, while razing the tracks and the surrounding structures will cost anywhere between $35million and $51mllion. Advocate: Landscaper Peter VanMeter had lead regular tours to the Reading Viaduct until his death earlier this year . Secret space: A portion of the railway is submerged under Central Philadelphia . Storied past: The train tracks had been owned by the now-defunct Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, which . In a video about the project produced for PBS just months before his passing, VanMeter described the railway as the very embodiment of Philadelphia’s spirit and its illustrious industrial past. ‘Every city, every place has these post-industrial spaces, and they're becoming great gardens,’ VanMeter says in the video while making his way through one of Viaduct’s gloomy tunnels. ‘Philadelphia doesn't have one yet - we think this is it.’ Peter VanMeter was not the only one working behind the scenes to make the park plan a reality.  A group called Friends of the Rail Park have been around for more than a decade advocating for the redevelopment of the three-mile stretch of train tracks. Money talks: A study showed that razing the rusted train tracks will cost 10 times more than redeveloping them . Inspiration: Philadelphia activists want to model their elevated and submerged railway park on New York City's celebrated High Line . Members of the organization, which has come to spearhead the Reading Viaduct project, are convinced that turning the dilapidated, rusting railway into a landscaped promenade will help revitalize the surrounding neighborhoods, which is what the High Line did for New York City's once-gritty Chelsea. In April of this year, the advocates' efforts finally began to bear fruits when city and state officials quietly earmarked millions of dollars toward the first phase of the Viaduct's makeover: turning a quarter-mile of the tracks into a park.

The Soyuz slipped into a berthing port on the station's Rassvet module at 1.44am today prompting congratulations from the Mission Control in Moscow for a successful voyage.

Until . last year, Russian spacecraft used to travel two days to reach the . station, and this will be only the fifth time that a crew has taken the . six-hour 'fast-track' route. After the previous launch, in March, the crew ended up taking the longer route because of a software glitch. Experts say the faster route is necessary as the cramped interior of the Soyuz can be stressful and uncomfortable for astronauts, many of whom will be suffering from space sickness at the time. However, carrying out the mission in one-day requires extremely precise 'orbital adjustments' from the Space Station ahead of docking and the shortened trip has only been made possible after extensive studies carried out last year. The Russian and US space agencies have continued to co-operate despite friction between the two countries over Ukraine.

More than two weeks later, the pup who got a rough start in life is ready for a second chance. On May 10, two women spotted a starving dog hiding in a large park in a mountainous area of Los Angeles where people have been known to ditch their unwanted pets. Scroll down for video . Poor pup: This pit bull was abandoned in a Los Angeles park earlier this month and left to die of hunger and disease . Skin and bones: The pooch appeared rail-thin and was too weak to stand up . Ravenous: Savannah hungrily gobbled up morsels of food offered to her by the Good Samaritans . Hero: Animal rescuer Eldad Hagar was able to coax the frightened, dying animal from her hiding with treats and placed her in a car . The animal appeared badly injured and had her tail tucked between her hind legs, leading the Good Samaritans who found her to believe she was a male. When Eldad Hagar, the co-founder of the animal rescue group Hope for Paws, got the call about the pit bull, he was on his way to save another animal, but made a detour to the park. The rescue team made a touching video showing their efforts to lure the badly injured, rail-thin Savannah from her hiding. The 4-minute clip opens with the emaciated pup with a severely inflamed left eye cowering in the brush, her ribs clearly visible through her skin. The rescuers offer her treats to keep her calm while placing a leash around her neck, but they quickly discover that she is too weak to put up a fight. ‘She was so . hungry, so tired,’ Hagar told Huffington Post. ‘The process of . starvation is horrible. The body first breaks down all the fat for . energy, then muscles, then internal organs... it's a slow and very . painful death.’ After . about two hours, Savannah was placed in a car and rushed to a . veterinarian where a closer examination revealed that the pup also had a . wound on one of her paws and a large tumor in her ear.

"By . Katy Winter . As our selfie-obsession continues unabated, the trend has grown to encompass the ‘healthie’, with the subject captured in an elaborate yoga poses or in the gym; the ‘shelfie’, where you show off your intellectual side by snapping your bookshelf and, of course the ‘belfie’. Sparked by celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Kelly Brook and Rihanna the ’belfie’ involves taking a picture of your own derriere, usually in a rather flimsy pair of pants or thong. For those who feel it necessary to share their backside with the world, being proud of your posterior is a must, which involves not only some serious squatting sessions, but also perfect skin. This has all led to an explosion in the popularity of the 'bottom facial'. Kim caused a stir when she took to Twitter to reveal her post-baby body in all its glory in a revealing white swimsuit, sparking the Belfie trend . Never one to shy away from exposing her body, Rihanna shared this Belfie snap with her Instgram followers . These involve the same spot-busting treatments and firming masks usually used on the face and neck, as well as cleansing and extractions of pimples. EF MEDISPA, which collated the information, says many of those undergoing the bum facials said they were motivated by seeing celebrities' perfect behinds displayed on social media. Kim Kardashian caused a stir when she took to Twitter to reveal her post-baby body in all its glory in a revealing white swimsuit after the reality star welcomed daughter North into the world back in June. Thrusting the 33-year-old back into the spotlight, the sexy selfie caused a media storm of epic proportions. The revealing shot sent shockwaves through social media sites within moments of Kim posting it, attracting more than 3,300 comments on MailOnline and sparking a wave of copycat images. Buxom beauty Kelly Brook made sure to get the best angle of her assets in this Belfie, which she said was inspired by Kim Kardashian . Cheryl Cole can be sure that most people are not looking at the scenery in this Belfie against an idyllic backdrop . Lady Gaga's Belfie shows why women feel increasing pressure to obtain a 'perfect' bottom . Rihanna, Kelly Brook, Cheryl Cole and Lady Gaga are just some of the A list names who have promoted their toned tooshies on their social media accounts. Esther Fieldgrass, who owns the spa, said: ‘As they spend the majority of the year hidden away in clothes, our bottoms don't get the care and attention they deserve, with many of us often neglecting this area from our skincare routine altogether. ‘Combine this with desk jobs, tight underwear that causes friction and traps sweat against the skin, and tiny hair follicles which can become blocked, and you have the perfect recipe for a spotty bottom.’","Celebrities have jumped on the 'belfie' trend started by Kim Kardashian .

The rapper did see the funny side, later adding an Instagram video with the message: 'The s*** almost hit the camera man damn, if you look close you can see them moving the plate.

"By . Associated Press . A Mexico City pro-breastfeeding ad campaign is being re-worked after it fueled a storm of protest from women's health groups over its highly sexualized nature. 'Give your breast to your child, don't turn your back on them', read the ad banners, splashed across the chests of thin local celebrities in topless poses which expose their distinctly non-mummy-tummies. An anonymous official at Mexico City's health department has acknowledged that the campaign's slogan will be changed . and that its next phase may include more average, . everyday mothers. Ideal poster girl? Mexico City's health department has caused protest over a recent sexed up ad campaign (pictured) to promote breastfeeding which states 'Give your breast to your child, don't turn your back on them' Regina Tames, director of the Group for Informed Reproductive Choice, says of the ads: 'It's not only a very terrible campaign in terms of how it looks, but it's also the message that if you don't breastfeed, you are a bad mother and you are the one to blame', according to KBPS. Some activists have pointed out that the ads look more like shampoo or soap . commercials - which routinely feature lighter-skinned, glamorous models - . than a discussion of a serious problem. Even one of the campaign's stars, actress Camila Sodi, asked on Twitter 'not be associated with the campaign of breastfeeding.' Guilt-tripping? These somewhat smug photos do little to address the reasons behind the fact that only one in seven mothers in Mexico breastfeed exclusively in the first six months, as per World Health recommendations . 'I did not authorize anything, and I think it's in bad taste,' she wrote, later releasing a statement to say that although she supports the cause and posed for the campaign, she wasn't consulted on the final artwork. Mothers and women's groups were quick to accuse the government of making women feel guilty, instead of addressing the real-life barriers to breast feeding. One group of activists wrote a complaint letter to Mexico City's human rights commission, starting: '[The ads] condemn mothers, rather than . informing them about breast feeding, and they reduce a social problem . with multiple players - fathers as well as mothers, workplaces, health . authorities, and public spaces and the community at large — to one . person: the mother.' Hardly a mommy tummy! Many women have complained about the campaign's use of thin, light-skinned local celebrities instead of more 'average, everyday mothers' - which officials say they will alter . 'It doesn't look like they did any . diagnosis as to why women don't breast feed', agrees Ms Thames. 'They just . lighted on a banal argument that women were selfish and don't want to . mess up their bodies.' City officials released the campaign to address . the fact that only one in seven mothers in Mexico breast feeds . exclusively in the first six months, which is the standard recommended by the . World Health Organization. That is among the lowest levels in Latin . America, and health experts say it's a serious problem for a country . where millions live in extreme poverty and dirty water threatens health. Mother's milk is thus of vital importance because it’s richer in nutrients and antibodies that protect newborns from infections. Take it down! Even one of the campaign's own stars, actress Camili Sodi (pictured left and right), took issue with the way in which her image had been used to promote breast-feeding in Mexico . The city's health department had intended to use the ads to publicize its broader effort of setting up dozens of breast-feeding areas: comfortable, screened-off rooms with sinks and refrigerators to hold breast milk. 'It's not only a very terrible campaign . in terms of how it looks, but it's also the message that if you don't . breastfeed, you are a bad mother and you are the one to blame' But only three such centers currently operate in this metropolis of nine million people. Women also face prohibitions on breast feeding or pumping at work, get about 12 weeks maternity leave on average, and often draw hostile stares if they breast feed in public. Furthermore, Mexico has yet to sign on to the World Health Organization guidelines that restrict hospitals from handing out free baby formula and marketing their products to new mothers. It is unknown how soon it will be until the new, altered campaign will be revealed.","The ads were intended to address the fact that only one in seven mothers in Mexico breastfeeds exclusively in the first six months .

"By . Martha De Lacey . If you get dizzy at the top of tall buildings, spare a thought for Laura Taylor. The 22-year-old from Essex no doubt experienced more than just the head-rush of vertigo when her brave boyfriend sprung her with a marriage proposal 800ft above London at the top of the newly-opened Shard. Miss Taylor was with her boyfriend James Episcopou, also 22 and from Essex, at the official opening of the Shard's observation deck on level 72, when her beau got down on one knee and surprised her. James Episcopou proposing to Laura Taylor at top of the Shard 800ft above London as Boris Johnson opens building . Moments earlier, Mayor Boris Johnson cut the ribbon to welcome visitors to the highest vantage point in western Europe - 800ft (244m) above London. Undaunted by the world's media and the Mayor of London watching him, Mr Episcopou dropped to one knee beside the glass wall and asked for his girlfriend's hand in marriage... and was rewarded for his bravery when Miss Taylor said yes. The engagement took place on level 72 of the Shard, just over 800ft (244m) above the capital. After the event, Mr Episcopou, a supervisor at John Lewis, said he had no idea that Boris Johnson and a media pack would be on the observation deck at the same time. He said: 'I've had it planned since July last year. When tickets first came out I thought I've got to buy them, it's the perfect place to propose. 'Laura means everything to me and I wanted to make her feel on top of the world. 'We had no idea the media were going to be there, but when we arrived we saw Boris Johnson and there were cameras everywhere.' When asked if the presence of the media made him even more nervous, he replied: ""There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to do it. 'For Laura it's made the day even more special. When people plan a proposal they think, ""how can I make it special?"". I managed to do quite a good job.' Miss Taylor, a 22-year-old accountant, said: 'I had no idea he had planned it. I thought we were going up to look at the view. 'James asked me to come over to him because some photographers would like to take our picture. The next moment he was on one knee and proposing. I was so shocked. I said ""yes, definitely"", but then I was speechless.' Laura Taylor got engaged to James Episcopou at the top of The Shard . Mr Johnson described London's tallest building as 'a most amazing place'. He said: 'I don't think there's anything in London like this. 'It's the closest thing to being in an airplane and looking down on London. But you can walk around, you've got complete stability. 'You can see all the bends in the river, you can see my office, you can see Buckingham Palace, you can see the whole thing for 40 miles around.' The Shard's architect, Renzo Piano, added: 'This building is magic for a number of reasons. 'First, because it's in London, second, because it's so tall, and third, because this building is a part of London. It's a sense of London. 'It's sad when London is sad, it's joyful when London is brilliant and joyful.' Some 800ft in the air, James Episcopou asked Laura Taylor to be his wife . On a clear day, visitors to the Shard, which towers over the city at a height of 1,016ft, are promised a spectacular view of the capital. But visibility was restricted for the dignitaries, journalists and members of the public attending the launch because of wet and cloudy weather. Some 4,800 people paid for admission today - at £24.95 for adults and £18.95 for children. Terry Quelch and his wife Merill travelled from Bristol to be among the first to experience the new attraction. Mr Quelch, 69, said: 'It's great looking down and seeing all the landmarks. I do like the shape of the building, the way it spikes up like an icicle in reverse.' His wife, 65, said: 'London hasn't had anything like this since the Eye. I think it's brilliant.' The engagement took place on level 72 of the Shard, just over 800ft (244m) above the capital . On a clear day, visitors will be able to enjoy a 360-degree view of the capital's skyline, from a platform almost twice the height of any other in the city. With the help of specially designed telescopes, they should be able to pick out London's landmarks in the streets below. Visitors to the attraction - on floors 68, 69 and 72 - are whisked up in two high-speed lifts in around 60 seconds.

Officials spoke with Frappier Wednesday morning and a helicopter crew spent the day conducting reconnaissance and setting up rescue supplies.

But temperatures cooled in the afternoon which made the mountain more stable and safer for the rescue mission.

"By . Snejana Farberov . Long before X-Men director Bryan Singer became entangled in a web of sex assault allegations, the filmmaker was photographed happily throwing money at a male stripper in a West Hollywood gay club. Singer, 48, was sued last month in Hawaii by a male model named Michael Egan III, who accused the famed filmmaker of molesting him when he was 17 years old as part of a Hollywood sex ring. Signer's attorney dismissed that the allegations of sexual abuse as 'completely fabricated.' Scroll down for video . X-rated: Bryan Singer, director of the X-Men franchise, was pictured in January 2013 stuffing cash into a male stripper's Speedos in West Hollywood . Accuser: Model Michael Egan III filed a lawsuit last month alleging the X-Men director sexually abused him as a teenager . More than a year earlier, in January 2013, the hard-partying Hollywood big shot spent a wild night with friends at the Abbey Food & Bar, according to Radar Online. Mr Singer was accompanied by Francia Raisa, the 25-year-old star of The Secret Life of the American Teenager, who was caught on camera kissing the director on the lips. In a recent interview with an LGBTQ publication, Singer described himself as ‘quite bi-sexual.’ When he was not making out with the TV actress 20 years his junior, Singer apparently kept himself busy by stuffing hundreds of dollars in cash into a male stripper's red Speedos. Gal pal: Actress Francia Raisa, 25, was photographed last January making out with Singer, 48, in the Abbey Food & Bar in West Hollywood . 'Bryan kept giving the stripper hundred dollar bills to give five to 10 minute lap dances to himself and his friends in his booth,’ an eyewitness told Radar Online. According to some estimates, Singer spent between $700 and $800 on adult entertainment that night. His net worth is about $70million. Besides private dances, the X-Men director also made sure that he and his guests never ran out of drinks at the table; at the end of the night, the 48-year-old filmmaker allegedly plunked down $1,200 to cover his extensive tab. Still on top: Singer's X-Men sequel earned more than $110million during opening weekend despite the sex abuse scandal . A second lawsuit was filed earlier this month against Singer by an unnamed British teenager, who accused the director and one of his friends in the entertainment industry of trying to have sex with him against his will. This week, Singer filed a motion to dismiss Michael Egan's lawsuit claiming intentional infliction of emotional distress, battery, assault and invasion of privacy due to lack of jurisdiction. Despite his legal troubles, Singer's latest offering, X-Men: Days of Future Past, won the Memorial Day weekend box office by grossing $111million.","Bryan Singer, 48, was caught on camera in January 2013 stuffing cash into male stripper's Speedos in Abbey Food & Bar in west Hollywood .

"By . Claire Cisotti . As I arrive home these days, my heart starts to beat a little faster. After 15 years of marriage, my husband can still bring a flush of excitement to my cheeks and a girlish smile to my lips. But it’s not the prospect of a massage with scented oils that gets my pulse  racing, or the long, lingering kisses he surprises me with. It’s the glorious sight of the bins neatly placed outside the front door, the prospect of crisply-ironed sheets in the laundry room, and the delicious smell of a home-cooked meal in the kitchen. My husband has become a domestic god — and, to me, that’s pure romance. New regime: Claire at home with husband Max . Trust me, there is nothing more erotic than the sight of your husband in a pinny to re-spark a dormant libido. Last week, a report revealed couples who divide the domestic chores score higher on marital satisfaction and are more likely to stay together than those who don’t. I could have saved the University of Illinois researchers a lot of time and money based on my findings alone. How? Well, a year ago, fed up with Max’s chronic untidiness and refusal to help in the house, I went on strike for a week. Now I am convinced it is the best thing I ever did. It most certainly saved our marriage. Our relationship had become toxic. Max is a photographer, mostly working at night. I have a stressful job as a newspaper executive. Yet the responsibility for caring for our children, Zac, age 14, and  ten-year-old Mimi, plus the shopping, cooking and cleaning, had been dumped firmly on my shoulders. A typical day? After a ten-hour shift at work in London, I’d commute for two hours back to our house in West Sussex. I’d return exhausted, only to find piles of dirty laundry, two hungry, dirty children, and Max sitting in front of the computer surrounded by discarded Twix wrappers — his evening meal of choice. At bedtime, I was rarely in the mood . for sex. Max and I would exchange a few barbed comments and . we’d climb glumly into bed, before sleeping back-to-back without . touching . I never liked to cause a scene in front of the children, so would inwardly seethe as I supervised bedtime, cooked and tidied up. It wasn’t unusual for me to still be wearing my coat as I ironed school shirts and stacked the dishwasher at 10.30 pm — I was so busy I’d forget to take it off on my return. Hardly surprising, then, that at bedtime, I was rarely in the mood for sex. Max and I would exchange a few barbed comments — he assuming I was ‘in a strop about something’ and not daring to venture further — and we’d climb glumly into bed, before sleeping back-to-back without touching. This could go on for weeks  and weeks. And it made me sad, comparing this to the exciting early days of our marriage. Although I never seriously considered leaving Max, I’d reconciled myself to an existence where we shared a house and surname but little else. He wasn’t happy either, and was puzzled by my lack of interest in our love life and fed up with my constant nagging. Pure romance: the couple are both happier since Max became a domestic god . The final straw for me came one night exactly a year ago, when I returned home late after a difficult day to find the children watching TV and eating takeaways on the sofa, the house in complete chaos, no milk in the fridge and nothing for me to eat unless I cooked it for myself. Close to tears, I rang my elder sister. She told me things could not continue like this for the sake of my mental and physical health, not to mention the example I was setting the children. Was it right for Zac or Mimi to see their mother as little more than a skivvy — and an unhappy one?So I devised a plan. For one week, I would leave Max in charge of all things domestic and shut my eyes to the resulting mess. I was hoping the shock tactic would force him into action. That he would not only appreciate the sheer amount of work it took to run our house, but also see the truth of why I was left feeling so tired and unsexy every evening. It worked brilliantly. The house rapidly descended into chaos, with the sink piled high with sticky plates, the children searching for lost PE kits and curtains staying drawn for days. The stress and discomfort worked where nagging had singularly failed. The penny finally dropped for Max, especially when I wrote about my feelings about the situation at home in this newspaper. Shocked and hurt, he asked: ‘What can I do?’ I replied: ‘For a start, you can stop asking me what to do. Take responsibility for our home.’ The next morning, Max leapt out of bed and brought me up a cup of coffee, before making a lovely cooked breakfast. He walked Mimi to school and tidied the kitchen. And that evening the house was tidy, he’d put a wash on, and had even managed to make a risotto instead of buying a pizza. But, best of all, the bins had been put out for collection. Suddenly, instead of feeling like a taken-for-granted domestic slave, I felt pampered and cosseted. Suddenly, instead of feeling like a taken-for-granted domestic slave, I felt pampered and cosseted. No wonder the grateful kiss I gave him turned into something a bit more enthusiastic . No wonder the grateful kiss I gave him turned into something a bit more enthusiastic. All the same, I was sceptical this was anything more than a one-day wonder. Max, after all, is an Italian mamma’s boy and was brought up in a wealthy, aristocratic family where staff did the housework. It had simply never occurred to him he would be expected to pitch in after we married. As far as he was concerned, it was enough that he pulled in a salary. The fact that I brought home the bacon, too, didn’t seem to count. However, I had been raised very differently. My father was a new man before the term was even invented. Despite working two jobs, he would always get up in the night to change a nappy, and brought my mother breakfast in bed. No wonder, with such different domestic expectations, Max and I had started to clash.I waited with dread for the moment when he would stop making an effort and we’d slide back into our unhappy groove. But, a year on, that moment has never come. Now, instead of feeling angry and exploited, I am comforted by the feeling that Max and I work as a team. I have learned to temper my perfectionism. I still colour-code my underwear but no longer force my standards onto others. Husbands take note: Women will make more effort int he bedroom if you help out around the house . Plus, instead of nagging, I tempt him to do the housework with gadgets he’ll enjoy using. Ever since I brought home a Panasonic breadmaker, he has made fresh loaves for the family every day. He recently came home with a carpet cleaner and got to work. ‘Just look at the dirt I’ve got out of this carpet,’ he said proudly afterwards. At last Max was taking pride in our home, and this has had a huge impact on the whole family. The children see we’re all responsible for the house, not just me, so they have started helping too. Mimi can tackle a whole basket of ironing. Zac packs his school bag and, last weekend, made bacon sandwiches for everyone and loaded the dishwasher afterwards. But the best thing of all about sharing the domestic load? Our love life has never been better. For one thing, I find Max even more attractive, as he’s physically fitter. In the old days, he would lounge about, smoking and eating chocolate, but since doing the housework, he’s lost a stone. We no longer need a gardener and eat fewer takeaways. What we save is spent on date nights instead. This Christmas, Max bought me jewellery for the first time. And he took me away to a hotel for Valentine’s Day. Also, because he now appreciates everything I do for the family, my nagging is a thing of the past . So here’s my advice to all you husbands out there: if you want your wife to make more of an effort in the bedroom, start by putting some effort yourself into the rest of the house. The results may make you the happiest man ever.","Couples who divide domestic chores have higher marital satisfaction .

"By . Claire Bates . Women in the UK and U.S are selling their breast milk online, despite serious concerns that it could be harmful for babies. Mothers are using community forums, including Facebook, to make some quick cash out of their extra milk. Buying breast milk is tempting to new parents struggling to express their own, as it provides babies with better protection against illnesses and allergies compared to formula. Mothers are selling their excess breast milk to make some quick money on a classifieds website . Websites such as onlythebreast.com appear to answer this need, saying: 'Our discrete breastfeeding breast milk classified system . makes it possible to sell or buy breast milk in a clean, private way.' Donor mothers list their milk under the age of their baby and if they can provide fresh milk on demand. A search around the site reveals women from Essex to Newcastle are offering it either fresh or frozen for around £1 per fluid ounce, while $2 per ounce is the standard rate in the U.S. The site has 14,000 members. The website's founder Glenn Snow said . he set it up after his wife Chelly said she wanted to sell her extra . milk to give her some spending money as a stay-at-home mother. 'She found many mother looking to buy . breast milk online because it was not available through their hospital . or breast milk bank,' Mr Snow told Mail Online. 'So Chelly asked me to build a site dedicated to moms that want to share their breast milk with babies in need.' Mothers can donate and receive breast milk for free via milk banks. These . centres store breast milk for babies whose mothers can't breastfeed. However, they give priority to babies who are sick. New mothers buy and sell breast milk on various social networks including Facebook . The . banks collect expressed milk from pre-screened mothers who have a plentiful supply and a baby under six-months old. It is then pasteurised before it is offered to nearby hospitals. But today doctors in Germany warned new parents against privately obtaining their baby's food through social networks such as Facebook. The Professional Association of Pediatricians said that although breast is generally the best option for newborns, mothers unable to breastfeed should not turn to the internet. 'Donors can be taking medicines or drugs, have infectious illnesses like AIDS or Hepatitis,' Wolfram Hartmann, president of the association, said. 'Nobody can check whether the unknown . mother's milk is harmless for the particular child' he warned, adding . that the milk's quality could also be affected during its . transportation. The warning follows a report by the . online edition of German news weekly Der Spiegel and the association's . own research, it said. Mothers are counselled to use formula milk only when they 'move on' from breast-feeding . It also warned that a newborn's nutritional needs differed from those of a baby even of several weeks or months old. 'The milk of a woman who already has an older child does not contain the right nutrient composition for a newborn,' it added, and said women who were unable to breastfeed should use special powdered milk. Although websites such as onlythebreast.co.uk says families can take precautions such as asking for medical documents showing the donor has a clean bill of health, this isn't mandatory. Mr Snow insisted: 'The mothers are very good at screening each other.' He added: 'These doctors reports always fail to mention that a large percentage of the donors on our site have been milk bank approved and/or have undergone blood tests assuring the safety of their milk.' Professor Mitch Blair, Officer for Health Promotion at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: 'We encourage women to breastfeed where possible – as it can have real health benefits for both mother and child. 'For mothers who are unable to breastfeed, but want to give their children breast milk, the NHS breast milk bank provides a safe outlet for them to do so. 'We would strongly recommend using these official NHS milk banks rather than buying breast milk from other sources over the internet. 'It’s crucial that the milk is checked thoroughly for substances that could be harmful to the baby, that it is pasteurised properly and that it is transported safely - and only through official milk banks can we be sure that’s the case.' Selling breast milk also throws up ethical questions, as one mother found when she expressed an interest in selling hers on Netmums. One member asked why she wouldn't donate something that was 'free to make', while another responded: 'I can not believe someone would want to profit from a mother & baby's misfortune.","Women are selling their milk for £1 per fluid ounce online .

"By . Martin Robinson . Rolf Harris' own daughter accused him of abusing her best friend, a court heard today. Bindi Harris was 'beside herself' and was 'banging her head against a wall' during an irate phone call she made to him in 1997. Ms Harris, now 50, also smashed some of his art after his alleged victim said the star abused her from the age of 13, the jury was told. Scroll down for video . Lonneke Broadribb, 49, a childhood friend of Bindi Harris, told the Rolf Harris trial that Mr Harris would often greet people with a 'big cuddle or a kiss' but that it was affectionate rather than sexual . Southwark Crown Court was told the conversation took place in the late 1990s while Harris was overseas. The woman, a . childhood friend of Bindi, had confided in her after a night of . drinking together 17 years ago when Ms Harris asked her: 'Did he touch . you?', the court heard previously. The . alleged victim claims the veteran entertainer abused her over 16 years, . starting when she was just 13 in 1978 during a family holiday to Hawaii . and Australia. Cross-examining Harris, 84, who is giving a third day of evidence, prosecutor Sasha Wass QC, asked him about the confrontation. She said: 'Bindi was beside herself, wasn't she, at the time after she had spoken to (the alleged victim)?' Harris replied: 'I suppose so, yes.' Family: Rolf Harris arrives at Southwark Crown Court holding the hand of his daughter Bindi, who banged her head against a wall and smashed his art after accusing him of abusing her friend, a court heard today . Ms Wass continued: 'And (she) had told her (Bindi), and she (Bindi) accused you of sexually abusing (the alleged victim) didn't she?' When Harris agreed, Ms Wass added: 'She was so upset she smashed some paintings. 'She was in such a state that she was actually banging her head against the wall - did the information filter down to you?' Harris said he had not been aware of that, but admitted that he knew Bindi had destroyed his artwork and had been in 'shock'. Ms Wass asked Harris if during the conversation he told his daughter that he had not abused her friend as a child, but that they had had a consenting adult relationship. The Aussie entertainer said: 'I can't remember exactly what I told Bindi at the time. I can't remember exact details of what Bindi said.' Evidence: Rolf Harris is in the witness box for a third day and denies 12 counts of indecent assault between 1968 and 1986 . Yesterday TV favourite Harris admitted that he admired his daughter's 13-year-old friend sexually while on holiday, and admitted having a 'darker side' alongside his public persona. He was asked by the prosecutor if his 'slow walk' into court, with his wife Alwen on one arm and Bindi on the other, was 'just for the cameras', to which he replied: 'It's to show support.' Count 1: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on girl aged 15 . Count 2: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15 . Count 3: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15 . Count 4: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15 . Count 5: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15 . Count 6: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15 . Count 7: Indecent assault between 1/1/84 and 1/1/85 on same girl, then aged 19 . Count 8: Indecent assault on 31/5/86 on second girl, aged 14 . Count 9: Indecent assault on same girl, 14 . Count 10: Indecent assault on 31/5/86 on same girl, 14 . Count 11: Indecent assault between 1/1/68 and 1/1/70 on third girl, aged 7-8 . Count 12: Indecent assault on fourth girl, 14, between 1/1/75 and 1/1/76 . The former television presenter denies all the counts. Ms Wass suggested today there was a 'common theme' among the allegations, which included claims that Harris preyed on women as he met them in his public role, abused them with an originally friendly gesture, assaulted them while they could not get away, did it while people were nearby, and then afterwards behaved as if nothing had happened. But the star dismissed all of the allegations against him as lies today. He denied that his claim that the woman asked him for £25,000 was an 'attempt to discredit' her and her family, and denied also trying to 'vilify' alleged victim Tonya Lee. Ms Lee, who has waived the usual right to anonymity given to alleged sex offence victims, claims . Harris touched her when she travelled to Britain from Australia for a tour in 1986.Harris told the court he accused Ms Lee of making up the allegation because her story 'didn't hold water'. He denied ever meeting Ms Lee, appearing more irritated: 'You're not listening to me, I never met Tonya Lee.' Asked why she would have lied, he said: 'It would only be to support her story. I can't imagine why she would say that, but it's all lies.' Harris also dismissed another allegation, made by a woman who claims he groped her as she got an autograph from the star at a community centre in Portsmouth, and told the court he was 'never there'. He said he would not have needed to tour the country to promote his hit Two Little Boys, because it was an 'instant hit and hardly needed any promotion', and said he would not have performed it unaccompanied. The star told the court: 'She's lying. It never happened, I wasn't there. I wasn't there, she must be making it up.' Harris was asked about another claim, made by a woman who has appeared as a witness, but whose allegations do not relate to a charge, in which he is said to have told her he wanted to be the first person to give her a 'tongue kiss'. He said: 'I would never say that, I hate that expression.' The star also dismissed another claim by a separate witness who says he groped her, saying it was lies, and said he had 'no recollection' of meeting another witness who has told the court he assaulted her in Malta. Lonneke Broadribb, 49, a friend of Harris's daughter Bindi, told the court that they had been friends at primary school, continuing into their teens. Miss Broadribb told the court that she had met the friend who claims Harris indecently assaulted her, but only knew her through Bindi. Defending Harris: Lonneke Broadribb, another friend of Bindi's, told the court the Harris family was 'warm' and 'very loving' as the entertainer looked on. Asked if she ever felt uncomfortable, Ms Broadribb said: 'no' Miss Broadribb described the Harris family as 'warm with each other, very loving, very cuddly, very giggly'. 'She (Bindi) had a great relationship with her parents, particularly close to her mum.' Miss Broadribb told the court that she had always been made to feel welcome by the Harrises, and, when asked by the star's defence barrister, Sonia Woodley QC, if she had ever found anything 'odd or weird' about them, she said no. She told the court that Harris would often greet people with a 'big cuddle or a kiss' but said it was affectionate rather than sexual. 'Did you ever feel uncomfortable in his presence?' Ms Woodley asked. 'No, never,' she answered. The case was adjourned until 10am tomorrow. Harris from Bray in Berkshire, denies 12 counts of indecent assault. He is accused of abusing four separate women, aged between seven or eight, and 19, over a period spanning almost 20 years, between 1968 and 1986. The trial continues.

"By . Adam Duggan . Up to 450 Qantas workers in Victoria and Queensland will lose their jobs as the airline moves to centralise its Australian call centre operations and move just 50 jobs to Hobart. Qantas announced on Wednesday that their Melbourne call centre, which employs about 250 full-time staff, would close by mid-2015. Meanwhile, the airline's Brisbane call centre, which employs about 200 full-time staff, will close by 2016. The move comes as Qantas tries to restructure operations, in attempt to save $2 billion over the next three years. Scroll down for video . Up, up and away: Qantas has announced they are shedding up to 590 call centre jobs in Brisbane and Melbourne . Getting through the pain together: The Australian Services Union said some call centre staff found out about losing their job through the media . Workers across both facilities will be offered redeployment to Hobart - where the airline plans to operate a single call centre facility by 2016. The Australian Services Union (ASU), which represents workers at both call centres, said the Victorian call centre is Qantas' only 24-hour operation. Of the employees, 70 per cent are female and most have been employed by Qantas for more than eight years. The ASU has attacked the move, claiming it will be customer service that suffers. Hanging up their headpieces: Call centre operations in Melbourne will cease by mid-2015, while Brisbane operations will be completely moved to Hobart by 2016 . ASU Queensland secretary Julie Bignell said some of the Brisbane call centre workers set to lose their jobs didn't even hear about the job cuts from the airline, but through the media. 'This is just an outrageous announcement from Qantas today,' Ms Bignell said. 'That's just an appalling lack of consideration for your loyal employees to have to run around and ask other people whether they've got a job or not.' 'We're all in shock, still all in shock,' one Brisbane worker told Nine News. Financial assistance available, for those willing to move to Hobart: Financial assistance will be available to Brisbane and Melbourne call centre staff, as long as they are willing to relocate to Hobart . In Melbourne, the Victorian Government has come under fire for not trying to do more to keep positions in the city. 'The Tasmanian Liberal Government fought for these jobs, and our government simply did not,' Victorian Opposition Leader Daniel Andrews said. 'These are hard-working, loyal staff who have worked their guts out for this airline for many, many years,' Australian Services Union Victorian private sector branch secretary Ingrid Stitt said. 'I've been with the company 18 years and seen the decline,' one Melbourne employee told Nine News Melbourne. 'It's a very sad day.' Closing the door on customer service: The Australian Services Union has warned that the closure of the Melbourne call centre, which is the only Australian one operating 24 hours a day, will lead to a decline in customer service . Despite expanding Brisbane operations, 200 workers will go: Qantas last year moved heavy maintenance and catering operations to their Brisbane hub (pictured) Affected employees in Melbourne and Brisbane will be offered redeployment to the Hobart call centre. Financial assistance will be available to workers willing to relocate. The move to keep the Hobart call centre came following confidential talks with the Tasmanian government. Tasmanian Premier Will Hodgman has declined to give details about how his state secured the future of Qantas' existing Hobart call centre. Hobart call centre operations will expand from 200 to 250, with Mr Hodgman saying that his government had 'put forward an appropriate support package.' Queensland government under fire: Despite heavy maintenance and catering operations moving to Brisbane last year, Queensland Premier Campbell Newman has come under fire for not doing more to secure call centre jobs in Brisbane . 'Operational complexity': Qantas Domestic CEO Lyell Strambi announced that the move to cease Brisbane and Melbourne call centre operations was part of the airline's attempt to cut $2 billion from it's bottom line over the next three years . Qantas Domestic CEO Lyell Strambi said operating call centres in Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania had become inefficient for the airline. 'Having call centres in three different states presents a number of challenges including property costs, duplication of management and operational complexity,' he said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Tony Blair has insisted he is not the reason for the delay in publication of the Chilcot Inquiry. The former prime minister said he resented suggestions that he was holding up the investigation into the Iraq war, which is four years late in delivering its conclusions. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: ‘It certainly isn’t me who is holding it up. Tony Blair denies that confidential notes between him and George Bush are delaying a report into the war . 'The sooner it is published the better from my  perspective as it allows me to go and make the arguments. ‘I don’t know what the reason for the delay is because I’m not in charge of the inquiry and not in charge of the Government. ‘All I can tell you is it is not for me and I resent the suggestion that it is. 'I have got as much interest as  anyone in seeing the inquiry publish its findings and then being able to go out and frankly restate my case and defend my position.’ Delay: The investigation into the Iraq war is four years late in delivering its conclusions . The confidential status of notes and conversations between the former Labour leader and then US president George W Bush are reportedly to blame for the delay. Mr Blair said: ‘Just so that it is absolutely clear, of course the inquiry has had all these documents for a long period of time. ‘Obviously there are a whole set of issues of confidentiality that have to be resolved. 'As I understand it, the Government is resolving them, so let us wait and see.’","Former Labour leader told Today programme he is not delaying report .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Known collectively as the BLT, Baloo the bear, Leo the lion and Shere Khan the tiger have forged an unusually strong bond and are the only bear lion and tiger in the world who live in the same enclosure. Considering that they would be mortal enemies if they ever were to meet in the wild, it is stunning to see their unique and genuine friendship in these intimate pictures. Rescued 13-years years ago during a police drugs raid in Atlanta, Georgia, the little family were only cubs at the time at barely two months old. Scroll down for video . Best of friends: Leo, Baloo and Shere Khan nuzzle up together at their enclosure inside the Noah's Ark Sanctuary in Georgia . They had been kept as status symbol pets by the drug barons. Delivered to the Noah's Ark Animal Rescue Centre in Locust Grove, Georgia, the decision was made to keep the youngsters together, because of their budding rapport. 'We could have separated them, but since they came as a kind of family, the zoo decided to keep them together,' said Diane Smith, assistant director of Noah's Ark.  'To our knowledge, this is the only place where you'll find this combination of animals together.' The only time they have ever been separated is when Baloo needed an operation to remove a harness that had been left around one of his paws. Noah's Ark Animal Sanctuary .

'We didn't have the money to move them at first,' said Diane.

'They are totally oblivious to the fact that in any other circumstance they would not be friends.' Handled by Charles and Jama Hedgecoth, the zoo's owners and founders, the three friendly giants appear to have have no comprehension of their animal differences. 'Baloo and Shere Khan are very close,' says Diane. 'That is because they rise early, and as Leo is a lion, he likes to spend most of the day sleeping.

'It is wonderful and magical to see a giant American Black Bear put his arm around a Bengal and then to see the tiger nuzzle up to the bear like a domestic cat. 'When Leo wakes up the three of them mess around for most of the day before they settle down to some food.' Surprisingly for three apex predators with the power to kill with a single bite or swipe of their paw, they are very relaxed around each other. 'They eat, sleep and play together,' said Jama. 'As they treat each other as siblings they will lie on top of each other for heat and simply for affection. 'At the moment they are getting used to their new habitat. 'Shere Khan is being quite reticent about the move, but Baloo, the bear is very good at leading him on and making him feel comfortable and safe.'

Spending their days together: Baloo, Shere Khan and Leo will spend the rest of their days together in the luxury of their $15,000 enclosure in Georgia . Quit messing around: Leo looks on as Shere Khan draws an irritated response from Baloo - reminding him that he is the largest of the three . Explaining that the three 'brothers' have always seemed to share a unique bond, Charles said: 'Noah's Ark is their home and they could not possibly be separated from each other. 'You just have to remember who you're dealing with when you are with them though. 'It's when you forget that these fellows are wild animals that you get yourself in trouble.' The trio's new habitat cost an estimated £15,000 and had to be constructed carefully, in order to accommodate its occupants. Jama said: 'The clubhouse had to be very sturdy for the guys, because they all sleep in it together,' She added: 'We had to include a creek, because the tiger and the bear both like to be in water.'","The three very unlikely friends were rescued from a drug dealer 13-years ago and have been inseparable ever since .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Anger: Emma Townsend, 23, was sent a text message from mobile phone company Orange reading 'You are sooo pathetic' in a row over a £110 unpaid bill . Mobile phone giant Orange sent a young mother a text message reading 'You are sooo pathetic' in a row over a £110 unpaid bill. Emma Townsend, 23, was shocked when she read the message, which was sent directly to her mobile after her boyfriend Carwyn Davis called to complain about an unexpectedly high bill. The mother-of-one from Stroud, Gloucestershire, is now demanding a formal apology from Orange, now part of EE, after she was sent the poorly-worded text which read: 'You are so pathetic you can't pay your bill and you blame it other people. You are sooo PATHETIC'. Ms Townsend said: 'I am shocked and very upset with Orange. 'The text I received was awful. I was out for lunch with my mother when my phone buzzed with a text from Orange. 'When . I read it, I was in shock. I could not believe someone would send me an . abusive text like that, especially when they are meant to be there to . help. 'It was borderline bullying and it is disgusting.' Ms . Townsend and Mr Davis, 24, have a joint account with Orange, which is . in her name, and they pay for their mobile phone bill by direct debit . each month. However, in April the pair received an unexpectedly high bill for £110. Mr Davis called EE customer services and was told there had been a problem with the direct debit in March, resulting in the payment not being made and so it had been rolled over into April. 'They told us we had missed a month, even though we have a direct debit, but we received a really high bill in April, which was a shock,' he said. The car salesman added: 'We did not understand how the bill had shot up without them telling us, so we rang Orange. 'We were told Emma should have rung up and paid the bill over the phone. But as we had the direct debit we assumed it would have been paid.' Ms Townsend said: 'Because of the high bill, we have had to forfeit other things and it has really messed up our finances. 'And then for someone to send me a text with abuse afterwards is just out of order.' After the couple had queried the bill, Ms Townsend received an automated text asking for rating on customer service. Shock: The mother-of-one from Stroud, Gloucestershire, is now demanding a formal apology from Orange, now part of EE, after she received this poorly-worded text . 'We were so unimpressed that we responded with ""one out of 10"" to every question,' said Mr Davis. The following day Emma received the abusive text. 'We just couldn't believe it. It was a despicable thing to send to Emma and it really upset her,' Mr Davis said. 'I called up Orange straight away and the employee apologised on behalf of the colleague who had sent the text and I was told it would be dealt with.' Mr Davis said he has been chasing Orange every week for an apology, but according to the couple they are yet to hear from the company. 'It has been weeks now and I've heard nothing,' said Ms Townsend, who works for supermarket chain Morrisons. 'No-one should receive a text like that, let alone from a big professional company. It is just not good enough.' The couple, who are parents to a 21-month-old son, Harley, say they are appalled with Orange. 'I feel like this has not been taken seriously at all. It is disgusting that they haven't bothered to ring Emma to apologise,' Mr Davis said. 'Even just a supervisor or manager calling to let me know that they have acknowledged the matter and are taking it seriously would be enough at this point.' He added: 'Our contract doesn't finish until September so basically we're drawn in until then. 'I don't want to carry on giving them our business after all of this. I think they need to do more to apologise as it was serious bullying behavior. 'We are still waiting for a formal apology.' Orange said it was taking the matter 'very seriously' and would be addressing it 'as a priority'. A spokesman said: 'We apologise unreservedly to Ms Townsend for the text received. We are investigating this and will take appropriate action.'","Emma Townsend received the message after complaining about high bill .

"By . Mark Duell . A woman who was abandoned as a baby on the steps of a health centre almost half a century ago today revealed how she was desperate to contact her real parents. Arlene Creed knows nothing of her true origins or her birthday - and her birth certificate says she was born 'on or about December 7, 1966'. The mother of two was aged between one and three months old when she was left 47 years ago in a yellow carrycot in Darwen, Lancashire. Mother of two: Arlene Creed, 47, lives in  Lancashire and has two children - Liam, 27, and Shannon, 11 . She was discovered wrapped in a brown green and yellow striped blanket together with a bottle, baby food, nappies, talc and spare clothes. Nurses gave her the name ‘Dawn Blackburn’, after the town and borough where she was left on the cold evening of January 16, 1967. It was not until she was adopted at the age of three that she was given the name 'Arlene'. Miss Creed said she had been tormented with never knowing the truth about her lost family, with whom she is desperate to get in touch. The former pupil of St Edmund Arrowsmith RC High School in Blackburn, said she had always wanted to know more about her past. Miss Creed said: ‘I have tried and tried to find my birth parents, but kept coming to a dead end. I think East Lancashire is where the secret lies.’ She made front page news in the Lancashire Evening Telegraph when she was found. 'Mystery baby': She made front page news in the Lancashire Evening Telegraph when she was found in 1967 . Cuttings from the time say she was 'well-nourished' and 'warmly wrapped', but that there was no clue to the identity of the 'Darwen mystery baby'. Siblings: Liam, 27, and Shannon, 11, her children . The article continued: ‘A telephone call from a man who would not give his name and address informed the police about 9.30pm that the baby was on the steps. ‘About an hour later, another anonymous male caller wanted to know if the baby had been collected.’ Police at the time said they were anxious to hear from anybody who knew of the baby's identity, but nobody came forward. Miss Creed, who has worked as a nurse across East Lancashire for 30 years, said she believed the man who called the Union Street health centre was her father - and that she was desperate to get in touch with him. She said: ‘In my head, he is my dad because whoever it was, phoned twice, so it is somebody who cared for me and wanted me to be found. ‘It is quite comforting to know they did care. I think they might have been in a desperate situation and did not know what to do. It was not that they wanted to get rid of me.’ After leaving school, Miss Creed studied at Salford University to become a nurse. She now lives in Waterfoot, Lancashire, and has two children - Liam, 27, and Shannon, 11. She said she had spent her whole life searching for information about her family and had managed to track down her birth certificate last year. But she was distraught to find no information about her parents, who she believes would be in their 70s now. Search: Miss Creed studied at Salford University to become a nurse. She is seen (right) with daughter Shannon . Her adoption broke down when she was 15 and she said she went to live with her adoptive grandmother who died two years later. Front page: Cuttings from the time say the baby was 'well-nourished' and 'warmly wrapped' Documents kept at the police headquarters in Hutton were destroyed by fire and Arlene's GP records from before she was 15 were all lost leaving her feeling like there was a 'conspiracy' against her finding the truth. The Rossendale Raft Foundation volunteer said part of the reason the hunt to find out about her family had become so desperate was because of a bone condition her children suffer from, which doctors believe could be hereditary. She said: ‘I have not had a family for so long and my kids have no grandparents, so it would just mean the world to find them. ‘If I did meet them and it did not work out, it would not be a problem. I just want questions answering. I do not blame them for what happened. ‘It is getting late, but there is a chance my parents could still be alive. I could have nursed my mum or a member of my family, I just do not know. ‘It is a bit like now or never. I do not want to get older and wish I had done more. When my daughter was born, she looked quite a bit like me and I want to know who I look like.’ Miss Creed, who believes she may have Irish roots because of her blue eyes, pale complexion and freckles, appealed for anybody who could help to get in touch. She said: ‘It is exciting, but it is also very scary. It happened 47 years ago and people's memories go, but somebody must know something. They must. I just want to fit all the puzzle pieces together.’","Arlene Creed, of Lancashire, does not know her true origins or birthday .

"By . Hugo Gye . Fraud: John Darwin has been forced to pay the State £40,000 from his newly matured pension pot . The man who faked his own death in a canoe accident in order to claim life insurance was today ordered to pay back £40,000 in compensation. John Darwin has so far repaid just £121 of the £679,073.62 he gained from the scam, which he orchestrated with his wife Anne. But after two private pensions matured, Teesside Crown Court ruled that he would have to hand over thousands of pounds to the Crown. Darwin, 63, from Hartlepool, did not challenge the application by the Crown to have the money removed from his bank accounts. Although the pensions were legitimately earned by Darwin during his work as a teacher and a prison officer, officials were still granted access to them in order to pay off the money he owes to the State. Prosecutor Jolyon Perks said that the defendant would have to hand over any money he manages to earn in the future. 'We believe it sends a strong signal to those who seek to benefit from their criminal conduct that these orders have teeth,' he said. 'They will be pursued and they will be rigourously enforced. The Proceeds of Crime Act is intended to be draconian.' Anne Darwin, who has now split from her husband, has repaid more than £500,000 under a separate order, and still owes another £177,000. The couple were both jailed for fraud after it emerged that they had made a false claim on Darwin's life insurance even though he was still alive and living in Panama. Outside court today, Tommy Maughan from the North East Regional Asset Recovery Team said: 'I'm pleased with the outcome today - Mr Darwin has now seen first-hand the full force of the Proceeds of Crime Act legislation in action. 'It's a robust law that allows police and prosecutors to make sure those who have benefited from crime pay back what they owe until their debt is paid. Repayment: Darwin, pictured outside Teesside Crown Court today, still owes more than £600,000 . 'The court assessed how much John Darwin benefited from crime some time ago, and today they have taken into account recently identified assets which the Judge has agreed can be confiscated. 'His full benefit from crime has still not been paid off, and if he comes into any substantial assets in the future we will again consider asking the court to revisit the Confiscation Order granted against him in 2009. 'Criminals should be warned that even if assets are gained legitimately this legislation can be used and their crimes may just come back to haunt them.' Partner in crime: Anne Darwin was jailed for her part in her husband's life insurance fraud . John Darwin left his children heartbroken when he failed to return from a canoeing trip near his home in Seaton Carew on Teesside in March 2002. He was reported missing, and after the wreckage of his canoe was found the next day he was officially presumed dead - allowing his wife Anne to claim thousands in life insurance. She used the money to repay the couple's debts and wipe out their mortgage - but in fact, John was living next door the whole time. In 2006, they moved to Panama, where they bought a tropical estate which they planned to turn into a hotel specialising in canoeing holidays. However, the next year Darwin decided he had to come back into the open in order to secure a long-term visa to continue living in Panama. He walked into a London police station in December 2007 - to the shock of his sons, who had assumed him long dead. Although Anne initially pretended not to have seen him for five years, a photograph soon emerged of the couple together in Panama, and their scam was exposed. In July 2008, the Darwins were convicted of fraud and sentenced to more than six years in prison each.","Darwin, 63, faked his own death in order to claim thousands in life insurance .

"By . Lucy Osborne . A teenage girl abused by her karate teacher killed herself after being systematically failed by social workers, a coroner ruled yesterday. In a damning verdict, he said that Dana Baker might still be alive if she had received a proper standard of care. Dana, 16, was found hanged in March 2011 after being removed from foster parents she called Mum and Dad. Dana Baker, 16, pictured, from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, confessed to being in a relationship with karate teacher Jaspal Riat, 52, two years before she took her own life in March 2011 . The teenager had been in care since 2009, when she took an overdose after revealing that karate teacher Jaspal Riat had been sexually abusing her since she was 13. At the time Dana, who represented Great Britain, told teachers she believed she was in a ‘soap-opera romance’ with the 52-year-old paedophile, who was jailed for eight years in September 2011. Over the 18 months to her death, she had five social workers from three different teams, three schools and two foster placements. But even though Worcestershire Children’s Services knew there was a risk she might kill herself, social workers did little to help her because they were too busy, the inquest in Stourport heard. Jaspal Riat, 52, from Birmingham, West Midlands, was jailed for eight years in September 2011 after being convicted of of sexual assault and seven counts of sexual activity with a child . Coroner Geraint Williams ruled that if even the ‘simplest measures’ had been taken, Dana, from Kidderminster, could have been saved. He condemned the authority for a series of ‘serious and systematic failings’ that he considered breached Dana’s human rights. The inquest heard that Dana confessed about her relationship with Riat in a school English lesson two years before she committed suicide. Vicki Blake, Dana’s deputy headteacher at Wolverley Secondary School said she had no response from social services or police for after reporting her concerns. At a meeting with Dana and her parents Trevor and Patricia, Mrs Blake said, the teenager said she believed she was in a ‘soap romance’. She called police again after hearing that Dana had revealed on Facebook that she was still having a relationship with Riat, that he was going to be arrested but they would run away together.Days later, Dana was placed in a psychiatric unit after taking an overdose. A social services strategy meeting due to be held a week later never took place but Dana went into foster care. Her parents told the inquest they believed it was a short-term arrangement. But when she moved on to her second foster family, they lost contact with her. Dana was taken away from the second couple, whom she called Mum and Dad, and sent to live with an adult friend, Sally King. But Mrs King was given no guidance on how to look after her. The night before she was found hanged, Dana was taken to hospital after becoming distraught at being taken away from her foster parents. In a final text to Mrs King, she wrote: ‘I love you all. I’m so sorry.’ Mr Williams said Dana had clearly intended to kill herself but added: ‘Her death was contributed to by a failure to have in place adequate measures to protect her from a known, present and continuing risk that she would kill herself.’ In a statement, Dana’s family said afterwards: ‘We will never know whether the outcome could have been different if Dana got the support she as asking for.’ Gail Quinton, head of Worcestershire Children’s Services said: ‘We have acted swiftly on areas identified for improvement and all actions in the serious case review have been undertaken. We have increased the number of social workers ‘ .","Dana Baker, 16, took her own life in March 2011 after affair with instructor .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Ed Miliband has revealed that he does not follow 'British news' - and instead prefers American political bogs and French economic theory. The Labour leader said he does not read newspapers or watch the news - and relies on his aides to tell him what's going on in the country. The revelation will add the concern among Labour MPs that Mr Miliband is out of touch with ordinary Brits. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband was mocked after a number of awkward images appeared of him eating a bacon sandwich . He has faced criticism from leading members of his shadow cabinet that he is 'weird' and was accused of being 'out of touch with reality' for not knowing the price of an ordinary weekly shop. Mr Miliband was also the butt of internet mockery after unflattering images of him struggling to eat a bacon sandwich were published last week. But the Labour leader dismissed the criticism - and insisted that his 'cost of living crisis' theme had hit a chord with the public. Speaking to the website Buzzfeed, he said he was in Nottingham last Tuesday when a man approached him to say that his part-time job at a petrol station wasn’t paying enough to take care of two children. The Labour leader 'looks weird, sounds weird, is weird', one shadow cabinet colleague said. But Mr Miliband insists the public will focus on the issues when it comes to next year's election . Mr Miliband says he prefers US political websites to 'British news' and relies on his aides to tell him what is happening in the UK . Mr Miliband said: 'He was really, really desperate because he felt couldn’t properly provide for his family. He was thinking of ending it all because he just couldn’t make ends meet.' 'Suddenly bacon sandwiches look slightly beside the point,' he added. Mr Miliband said he just ignored the personal criticism about his image and got on with his job. According to the Buzzfeed interview Mr Miliband does not have any TV screens showing rolling news channels in his office. He also refuses to have newspapers delivered to his home. Instead he relies on aides to tell him what is going on. Mr Miliband said his favourite news website is RealClearPolitics - an American political site popular in Washington. He also revealed that he tries to avoid Twitter, which his admits having a 'decidedly mixed record' with. The Labour leader once accidentally paid tribute to the late Bob Holness as the host of ‘Blackbusters’. He said: 'It’s always a good idea not to read the newspapers. I don’t read much British news. Ed Miliband said the personal attacks did not bother him - and showed the Tories were struggling to find a way to beat Labour . 'You get a lot of advice in the newspapers about what you should do. It’s much more important to follow your own path and stick to your own path. I’ve made that a rule in the last three and a half years.' Mr Miliband said the attacks on him showed the Tories were struggling to find a way to beat him. He said: 'Think about the attacks my opponents have been making on me, there’s a certain incoherence about their attacks. 'First of all they said I was ""Red Ed"", then they said I was weak, then they said it was back to the 1970s, and now it’s something else.' Mr Miliband was asked if it was a problem that the public thought he was a bit weird? He said: 'Frankly they were saying that… the press people who don’t like us have been saying that for some time. It comes with the territory. 'I think the heart of this is people think we are in a position to win the election and there are some people who don’t want us to win this election.' Mr Miliband also reveals that he does not think he will be able to take a holiday between now and the general election next May. He takes a break from politics by watching American baseball - and his team, the Boston Red Sox - on his iPad. He is also currently reading the left wing French economist Thomas Piketty. His two boys, aged three and four, prefer football - and rooted for Arsenal in the club’s FA Cup final victory over Hull. Mr Miliband added: 'I want them to make their own decisions about who they support.'","Reveals he does not follow 'British news' - prefers US political websites .

"By . Sam Webb . A teenage thug who savagely beat a great-grandmother with a crowbar in her own home has seen his sentence halved - because of his age. Frail Jean McDougall, 89, was smashed in the face with a crowbar by 18-year-old Aaron Davis last October. She was beaten so hard her false teeth came out and her glasses were left in pieces. Davis repeatedly kicked her and left her with a broken nose, broken eye socket and a fractured spine. Injuries: Jean McDougall suffered serious bruising around her eyes, face and upper arm, a laceration to her lip, bleeding on her brain and a compression fracture to the top of her spine - which still causes her pain . Her husband John, 84, was also clubbed with his wife’s walking stick by Davis who was raiding their home in Hextable, Kent. He was jailed for ten years at Maidstone Crown Court on May 6 and told he would have to serve seven years before being released on parole. But he appealed and two weeks later Judge David Griffiths QC cut his sentence to just five years because of his age . Mrs McDougall said: 'I’m a bit upset. I don’t think he should have had it reduced. 'We thought the sentence was quite fair, considering what he’s done. It’s dreadful really. He’s been very vicious. Thug: Aaron Davis has seen his sentence halved - because of his age . 'My husband is still getting terrible headaches. He has vascular dementia which means that his brain is collapsing and this attack didn’t help things - his head is really aching.' Davis stole £40 and a watch in the burglary last October and was linked to another violent beating a month earlier in the same road when he snatched £150. At his sentencing in May, Judge David Griffiths QC ordered him to serve ten and a half years in a young offenders’ institution, also imposing an extended five-year licence period for the protection of the public. He told Davis: ‘Your use of violence was gratuitous in the sense it was wholly unnecessary. You were intent on obtaining money because you wanted to show off to your friends. ‘It is quite clear that these were to some extent premeditated, targeted offences - targeted, in that you chose vulnerable, elderly victims. ‘On such victims you didn’t need to use violence at all because of their frailty, but you chose to do so as you went about pursuing your intention of relieving them of various items - cash and other personal belongings. 'The use of violence against such victims was cowardly and likely to cause them serious injury.’ The court heard how Davis knocked on the couple's front door and spoke to Mrs McDougall, asking her the time, before leaving. Later, having established his targets were elderly and vulnerable, he returned and this time demanded money. Mr and Mrs McDougall were found by a neighbour, covered in blood and seriously injured. The woman asked police that images of her injuries be shown to show the full severity of the attack. Jean, 89 and John McDougall, 84, at home. They say the teenagers vicious attack has had a lasting impact on their quality . In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mrs McDougall said: ‘I’m on anti-depressants. Sometimes I do burst out crying and I do have flash backs of the man standing on the front doorstep. ‘I would say I now feel 90 years, whereas before I felt about 60. My comfortable existence has been shot to pieces. If I hear a noise when I’m in bed I lie there terrified. ‘John is not well at all. He has lost about a stone in weight. He complains about his head being sore. He suffers terrible headaches. John and I are prisoners in our own home now. ‘I feel as if my life stopped on that day in October and now I have a new life which is full of worry and anxiety and difficulties.'","Aaron Davis, 18, of Hextable, Kent, was jailed for ten and a half years .

The Royal Navy photographers who captured the images during deployments with warships and Royal Marine commando units across the globe over the last 12 months were today recognised for their talent, dedication and creativity at the annual Peregrine Trophy awards in London. Joining up as any other rating into a particular trade such as logistics, engineering or warfare specialists, the sailors work hard to excel at their chosen field before being accepted into the elite photographic branch. The select few then work with the Royal Navy and Royal Marines on deployments anywhere in the world – from Antarctica to Afghanistan, from the UK to the Far East – taking pictures of maritime operations, personnel at work and demonstrating all aspects of Service life. The awards were open to the 42 photographers in the branch, who submitted 350 entries, while 11 amateur photographers put forward 65 images. The best of these images are showcased at tonight's prestigious annual Peregrine Trophy awards – which this year has been held on board HMS Bulwark in London.

"By . Jennifer Newton . A tiny beach hut with no running water or electricity has sold for more than £22,500 despite only measuring 10 foot by seven foot. The green hut in Ferring, West Sussex has been sold, subject to contract, after estate agent Symonds Reading received a bid for the shed close to the asking price. The shed is said to have views overlooking a shingle beach and the English Channel and is within close walking distance to a popular beach cafe. The green beach hut on Ferring seafront near Worthing in West Sussex, which is set to be sold for £22,500 . But despite the estate agent admitting that the property is little more than a garden shed, they say that many people are interested in owning a small beach front hut. This is even though for the same price, the buyer could purchase a one bedroom flat in Sheffield with a separate kitchen, lounge and bathroom. Roger Curtis, manager at Symonds Reading said: 'It's not plumbed in and doesn't have electricity so it's just little more than a garden shed on the beach. 'But people love them and at the moment have the money for them. The webpage of estate agent Symonds and Reading, who are marketing the beach hut . The hut, pictured centre, is in the middle of a row of similar huts and has views overlooking a shingle beach and the English Channel . 'They just want to have their own little place by the sea.' Beach huts originated as an evolution of the traditional Victorian bathing machines and are often now fully furnished and in high demand. Earlier this month a wooden hut in Southwold, Suffolk was put up for sale for £100,000, with any potential new owners given a 30 year lease by the council. While in March, a beach hit on Mudeford Spit in Christchurch in Dorset went on the market for £150,000.","The beach hut in West Sussex has views overlooking the beach and sea .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . His body was buried 600 years ago without any pomp and ceremony befitting of a king. But now the traditional funeral crown that Richard III never had, has gone on display in York. The golden headpiece was commissioned for the last king of the House of York by a leading historian who was involved in the archaeological dig that discovered Richard III’s remains beneath a car park in Leicester. Richard III's funeral crown (pictured) was commissioned by a leading historian who was involved in the archaeological dig that discovered Richard III¿s remains beneath a car park in Leicester . Richard III was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, ending the Wars of the Roses and the Plantagenet dynasty. His body was taken to Leicester by supporters of victorious Henry VII and buried in Greyfriars church, which is now the site of the council car park. Dr John Ashdown-Hill commissioned a 15th century-style gold-plated crown in tribute to the late king with white roses and gems. Richard was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 and was buried without pomp and ceremony . The crown was made by medieval jewellery expert George Easton who was inspired to create the design from historical artefacts such as relics and illustrations relating to the contentious monarch. ‘The crown is plated with gold, with the circle set enamelled with white roses and pearls,’ The York Press reported. ‘On the roses are set rubies and sapphires, representing the livery colours of the house of York. The crosses of the crown have more enamelled white roses, set with emeralds and turquoises.’ The historian had the idea of commissioning the crown when he was carrying the king’s remains away from the archaeological site, having been involved in searching for the lost remains of the monarch. The funeral crown is now on show at the Richard III Experience in York's Monk Bar – one of the medieval gateways to York. It will go on tour around the UK before playing a part in the king’s reburial at Leicester Cathedral. It was announced earlier this week that Richard III will finally be laid to rest at Leicester Cathedral after judges said it was time for the monarch to be given a 'dignified burial'. Distant relatives opposed plans to bury him in the city after his remains were discovered in a council car park. They said he should be placed in York Minster because it was a wish of 'the last medieval king of England'. The skeleton of Richard III  was discovered at the Greyfriars excavation site in Leicester, which was a church and is now the site of a car park. Now there is a 15th century-style gold-plated crown in tribute to the late king . Regal: The crown is plated with gold, with enamelled white roses. There are rubies and saphires at the centre of the roses representing the livery colours of the house of York . But the High Court told the claimants, who are part of the Plantagenet Alliance, there was no reason to interfere with the initial plans. Three judges said in a joint ruling: 'Since Richard III’s exhumation on September 5 2012, passions have been roused and much ink has been spilt. 'Issues relating to his life and death and place of re-interment have been exhaustively examined and debated. 'The Very Reverend David Monteith, the Dean of Leicester Cathedral, has explained the considerable efforts and expenditure invested by the cathedral in order to create a lasting burial place 'as befits an anointed King'. We agree that it is time for Richard III to be given a dignified reburial, and finally laid to rest.' Location: Richard III will finally be laid to rest at Leicester Cathedral after judges said it was time for the monarch to be given a 'dignified burial' Richard was born in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire. During the War of the Roses, Richard's father, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York was killed and in 1470, Richard and his brother Edward were exiled when Henry VI, from the rival house of Lancaster, took back the throne. Henry's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year, Edward became king. In 1483, Edward died and Richard was named as protector of the realm for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. Edward V and his brother Richard were placed in the Tower of London and after a campaign to condemn the deceased king's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, the princes were declared illegitimate. Richard III took to the throne the following day. He was crowned in July and in August that year, the two princes disappeared, Rumours spread the king had killed them to remove any threat they may have posed to his reign. In 1485, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond launched an attack on Richard III on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire. Many of Richard III's key lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle. Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII. It has been confirmed that Richard III had a curvature of the spine, although rumours of a withered arm haven't been verified form the bones found in the Leicester car park last year. Last year scientists discovered the king was riddled with roundworm after finding large numbers of the parasite’s eggs in soil taken from Richard III’s pelvic region. The find suggests that the king’s intestines were infected with roundworm during his life. Discovered: The remains of Richard III (pictured) were discovered by archaeologists in a council car park in Leicester. There have been heated discussions as to where the king is to be buried and the high court has now confirmed that he will be laid to rest in Leicester Cathedral .","Golden crown was commissioned by a historian involved in the archaeological dig that recovered Richard III from a Leicester car park .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Michelle Rossiter, who made up false rape allegations claiming she was abused by an innocent man from July 2010 to May 2011 . A woman has been jailed for three years after making up rape allegations against an innocent man. Michelle Rossiter, 34, made a series of false claims to police between July 2010 and May 2011, alleging she was sexually abused by the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, for almost a year. She also produced false evidence to support her story, but later admitted to officers some of her claims were untrue. Rossiter, of Preston in Lancashire, denied perverting the course of justice but was convicted by a jury of 11 men and one woman at Preston Crown Court. Mark Humphries, deputy head of the Crown Advocate Unit for the Crown Prosecution Service North West said: 'She had the opportunity to withdraw the complaint but instead she went a step further and produced false physical evidence to support her allegations. 'She eventually admitted to falsifying some of the claims during a further police video interview some months later. 'In the meantime, an innocent man had been arrested, detained in police custody and questioned over an 11-hour period. He then had to endure the weight of allegations for a significant amount of time. 'The Crown’s case was that all of the allegations she had made were false. The jury, after carefully considering all the evidence at the trial, convicted her of perverting the course of justice. 'False allegations of rape have a devastating effect on those who have been wrongly accused, their family and friends and, potentially, their future lives. 'They also take up valuable police resources and have a detrimental effect on the public’s confidence in genuine reports of rape and sexual offences. 'The CPS and police take all allegations of rape and sexual offences extremely seriously and hope that this case will not discourage anyone from coming forward with genuine complaints to the police in the future. 'We will support victims of such offences in every way possible throughout the process.' But despite historically low conviction rates for rape, Valerie Wise, director of Preston Domestic Violence Service, said malicious allegations are rare. Rossiter was jailed for three years at Preston Crown Court, pictured, after being convicted by a jury of 11 men and one woman . She added: 'It is very regrettable when people make false claims but we should not get this out of proportion. 'I believe 99 per cent of people who make complaints are telling the truth but it is difficult to prove. 'We mustn’t let cases like this affect how rape cases are viewed. 'The fact is rape is massively under-reported because it is difficult to report and there is such a low conviction rate. 'I would urge the public not to believe that most people are making false claims. 'I think public perception is making it harder for victims. The CPS doesn’t proceed to prosecution if they believe there is a less than 50 per cent chance of conviction - the standard is very high.' A spokesman for Lancashire Police added: 'In instances where the evidence suggests malicious allegations are made, then consideration will be given to prosecute. 'Lancashire Police would always urge all genuine victims to come forward and report any cases of sexual offences and we assure them that all reports are investigated fully.'","Michelle Rossiter made false allegations between July 2010 and May 2011 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Nick Clegg today insisted Vince Cable was not potting to topple him as Lib Dem leader, as senior party figures accused the Business Secretary of ‘treachery’. Mr Clegg said he had been reassured personally by Mr Cable that he did not know his close friend and ally Lord Oakeshott was bankrolling a series of polls designed to prove the Lib Dems were doomed with him still as leader. In an attempt to draw a line under the threat to his position, Mr Clegg put on a confident display during his weekly radio phone-in, denying he had cried after his election drubbing and demonstrating to Ed Miliband how to eat a bacon sandwich. Scroll down for video . This is how you do it: Despite his leadership woes, Nick Clegg closed his radio show by demonstrating how to eat a bacon sandwich, after Ed Miliband struggled with his breakfast during a photo opportunity last week . But Mr Cable continues to face questions about why he failed to inform the party high command about the activities of Lord Oakeshott, who dramatically quit yesterday after his plotting was exposed. Lord Oakeshott, Mr Cable’s closest ally and holiday partner, warned that the party is ‘heading for disaster’ under Mr Clegg. And he claimed Mr Cable knew all about secret polling he commissioned in Lib Dem seats to show they would do better without Mr Clegg as leader. It followed Mr Cable’s insistence that the ordering the polling was ‘utterly reprehensible’. Last night the Business Secretary was forced to break off from a trade visit to China to deny again having knowledge of his friend’s plot. Today Mr Clegg insisted that he believed his colleague, as he desperately tried to move on from the most damaging period of his turbulent time leadership. But he was forced to deny crying before giving an emotional interview in the wake of dire local and European election results, as the row about the future direction of the Lib Dems threatens to split the party in two. Plotter: Lord Oakeshott emerged from his home this morning, the first time he has been seen in public since his attempts to undermine Mr Clegg were exposed . Nick Clegg today denied he had been crying before an emotional interview in the wake of his elections bloodbath, . The Lib Dems lost more than 300 councillors and all but one of its MEPs in local and European elections. As the scale of the devastation became clear, and calls from activists grew for him to resign, Mr Clegg gave a TV interview in which he appeared emotional. With bloodshot eyes he said the results were 'gutting' but refused to quit. Asked if he had been crying, Mr Clegg insisted: 'Of course not.' When it was suggested by LBC host Nick Ferrari  'your eyes were red', he responded 'were they?' before trying to change the subject. The Deputy Prime Minister insisted he did not believe ‘for a second’ that Mr Cable had been behind the plot to force him out of the party's top job. During his regular Call Clegg show on LBC he said: ‘He was absolutely not aware of polls elsewhere. He has made it very, very clear that he, for instance, didn't want any questions about leadership in the poll which he did have some control over in his own constituency. ‘So, look I fully expect that people will try and suggest that there are endless plots and conspiracies. I don't believe that for a second. Vince is an outstanding Secretary of State for Business. ‘He and I have worked together for years and years and years and we are going to continue to work together in harness as part of a really strong Lib Dem team in government. Full stop.’ Mr Clegg insisted the Business Secretary is fully supportive of his leadership and the pair speak daily. ‘He supports me, he has said so and will no doubt say so again,’ he added. But when asked if the Lib Dems were heading for disaster under Mr Clegg, Mr Cable replied: ‘I'm not going to give ad hoc answers.’ However, Mr Cable has faced intense criticism for his failure to tell Mr Clegg what he knew about the polling work being carried out by Lord Oakeshott. He admits knowing about polls in his own Twickenham seat and in Wells in Somerset, and knew that Lord Oakeshott was looking to establish if the party would perform better without Mr Clegg at the helm. Sir Graham Watson, who lost his seat as an MEP in last week's elections, said Mr Cable had shown 'treachery' by not ordering friend to halt the polling immediately. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Of course it is the case that sometimes we can be as treacherous as our failure to stop something as we can by being involved but Vince Cable s doing an incredibly taxing and busy job and nobody believes that he is trying undermine Nick. 'Maybe he should have said to Matthew Oakeshott, very early on, ""Matthew this is not a good idea, don’t do it and if you want to do it my constituency fine, but don’t do it elsewhere."" Clearly he didn’t.'","Clegg forced to deny crying in the wake of dire local and Euro elections .

"By . Emma Glanfield . and James Slack . More than 1,600 crimes are being committed across England and Wales every single week by criminals who have been released from prison after serving short-term sentences. New figures released by the Ministry of Justice reveal how an average of 10 burglaries were committed every day in one year by newly-freed prisoners. The fresh data shows how offenders who were jailed for less than a year in 2011 went on to commit a total of 84,598 crimes in the 12 months following their release. New figures released by the Ministry of Justice reveal how an average of 10 burglaries were committed every day in one year by newly-freed prisoners . It included 3,873 domestic and commercial burglaries, 31,100 thefts, 625 robberies, 505 sex crimes, 4,643 drugs offences and 11,344 violent offences – the equivalent of 30 every day. Ministers said the research showed the danger of releasing criminals without proper supervision. From next year, criminals jailed for less than a year will be monitored in the community by charities, voluntary organisations and private firms. Some 21 new community rehabilitation companies have been formed to deal with medium and low-risk offenders while a new National Probation Service will be tasked with protecting the public from the most high-risk offenders. Currently, the probation service only keeps tables on those sentenced to a year or longer. Justice minister Jeremy Wright said: ‘These figures again bear out the urgent need for reform - too many criminals are walking the streets unsupervised and returning to crime, and honest, hard-working people are paying too high a price for that.’ It came as a report by the Prison Reform Trust claimed government spending cuts had left the prison service creaking under ‘unprecedented strain’. The study found two-thirds of prisons are overcrowded, holding two inmates in cells designed for one. It warned that reductions in staffing levels impact on safety and the amount of time prisoners are able to spend engaged in purposeful activity. Fresh data shows how offenders who were jailed for less than a year in 2011 went on to commit a total of 84,598 crimes in the 12 months following their release (file picture) A total of 1,575 serious assaults took place in prisons last year, the highest number for a decade and a rise of more than 300 over the previous 12 months. The report also revealed that, at the end of March this year, there were 10,649 foreign nationals behind bars, 12 per cent of the overall population. They come from 159 countries, with over half from Poland, Ireland, Jamaica, Romania, Pakistan, Lithuania, Nigeria, Somalia, India and Albania. Prison numbers soared by more than 500 in the two weeks between May 9 and May 23, compared to an overall increase of 1,496 in a whole year between March 2013 and March 2014. Last month it emerged that prisoners are set to lose their automatic right to day release following a series of serious crimes committed by offenders temporarily out of jail, including murder, robbery and drug smuggling. Under the new rules, inmates will be allowed out only for a specific purpose, such as work experience, and prisoners on day release will have to wear tags. They will also have to earn the privilege of day release through good behaviour and demonstrating a commitment to change - rather than automatically qualifying as they have previously.","Ministry of Justice figures reveal number of crimes by newly-freed prisoners .

"By . Julian Robinson . Adam Prosser, pictured right with girlfriend Kayley Harrison is in intensive care after being attacked on a holiday in Bulgaria . A man attacked by thugs on holiday was sent home with a bleed on his brain by a Bulgarian hospital because he didn't have his insurance document to hand. Adam Prosser, of Fforestfach, Swansea, who works for a disabled children's charity, was on holiday in the beach resort of Obzor, Bulgaria, with his girlfriend Kayley Harrison, 19, when he was brutally set upon by a group of men. But when the 27-year-old arrived at hospital with blood streaming from his ear, doctors refused to treat him because the couple did not have their European Health Insurance Card to show. The attack happened earlier this month - a day before the couple were due to return to South Wales. Miss Harrison, who works for a housing charity, said the onslaught happened as the pair were enjoying drinks with friends. The following day they flew home as planned and when Mr Prosser went to Morriston Hospital in Swansea to have his injuries checked he was transferred to the University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff after being diagnosed with bleeding on the brain and two fractures to his skull. He is currently in a stable condition. Miss Harrison said: 'It was our final evening of a fantastic holiday and we were having a drink at another resort with a couple we had met during the week. 'At about 11.30pm we said goodbye and went to leave so we could go back to our hotel as we were flying home the next morning. 'Before we could leave the bar this group of four or five men just piled onto Adam for no reason punching and kicking him. 'I tried to intervene by putting my legs over his head to protect him and when they realised that they'd hurt me too and I was bleeding they stopped. Adam Prosser, pictured right and, left, with his girlfriend Kayley Harrison, was refused treatment at a Bulgarian hospital as he did not have his European Health Insurance Card - even though he was bleeding from the ear . 'Adam stood in the way and tried to protect me so they started punching him again. 'We managed to run outside to try and get in a taxi but he lost his flip flop and one of the gang just came over and punched him to the floor. 'That's what did the real damage - he was unconscious for six or 7 minutes. 'When we got to the medical centre with the paramedics they sent us to a hospital in Borgor half an hour away. 'The doctors asked for our insurance card but because we didn't have it on us they just said: 'No, we can't treat you'.' She said that because they could not afford to pay up front they made Mr Prosser fill out a form and they had to leave. 'The doctor said he was lucky to survive the flight,' she added.

Miss Harrison said the couple were having a fantastic holiday before the attack and she posted a number of pictures of the couple enjoying themselves on Facebook.

"By . Sam Webb . Malcolm Glazer, the man who lead the controversial takeover of Manchester United, has died, according to a statement from his NFL franchise the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The American businessman, 85, leaves behind his wife, Linda, six children and 14 grandchildren. The statement from the American Football team, which he also owns, said: 'The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are saddened to announce the passing of Owner/President Malcolm Glazer earlier this morning at the age of 85.' Scroll Down for Video . Malcolm Glazer, the owner of Manchester United and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers NFL team has died, it has been announced . Sad news: The announcement from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers website . Born in Rochester, New York as one of seven children, Glazer took over the family watch-parts business at age 15 following the death of his father and then continued his foray into the professional world, investing in other businesses. Glazer owned or was a substantial shareholder of a diverse portfolio of international holdings and public companies, including: First Allied, Zapata Corporation, Houlihan’s Restaurant Chain, Harley Davidson, Formica, Tonka, Specialty Equipment and Omega Protein. In 2005, Glazer purchased Manchester United and in that time the club earned five league titles, as well as a Champions League title. Joel Glazer, left, Bryan Glazer, centere, and Manchester United  owner Malcolm Glazer in 2005 . But his tenure as owner has not been without controversy. Many supporters claim the squad has been on the decline since 2009 and the Glazer have been shielded by the ‘genius’ of long-serving former manager Sir Alex Ferguson. They claim club's spending power has been dented by spending hundreds of . millions on financial restructuring and debt . payments, and this has limited funds available for investment in the . playing squad. The club had no debts before the takeover and now owes nearly £400m. Glazer, a resident of Palm Beach, Florida, had been in poor health since April 2006 when a pair of strokes left him with impaired speech and limited mobility in his right arm and leg.

Many supporters claim the club's financial power has been dented by spending hundreds of millions on financial restructuring and debt payments . His sons Joel, Bryan and Ed have looked after the running of both teams - including overseeing the appointment of Van Gaal to replace Reds manager David Moyes after his ill-fated regime. A statement on the Manchester United website said: 'Glazer's death is not expected to have any significant effect on the ownership of United, with the family retaining a 90 per cent share in the club.' 'The thoughts of everyone at Manchester United are with his family tonight,' the Premier League club added.

"By . Amanda Williams . For years, rescuing cats from trees has been as much a part of a fireman's job as tackling burning buildings. But cat owners in Scotland will soon be charged £350 if their pet needs rescuing from a tree under a new charging policy for non-emergency call-outs being rolled out by fire chiefs. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is introducing a price list for attending all non-emergency incidents and industrial training events. Cat owners in Scotland will soon be charged £350 if their pet needs rescuing from a tree under a new charging policy for non-emergency call-outs being rolled out by fire chiefs . It could see drivers involved in crashes facing a fire brigade fee for clearing hazardous roadside spillages. And homeowners could pay for summoning firemen to pump out flood water or rescue their cat if it is stuck up a tree.

Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) said other non-emergency incidents crews attend include freeing people from jammed lifts and gaining entry to premises. Fire authorities have more freedom to charge after a revision in the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 in February. Eight regional fire services, which amalgamated to become SFRS on April 1 last year, had their own approach to charging for non-emergency call-outs. However, a report to the Fire Service . Board says the new charging policy for the single service enables the . service to 'explore potential income streams that have had limited . application in the past'. The charges are expected to bring in £136,000-a-year. They are based on the expected actual cost of delivery to the Fire Service, including overheads. A SFRS spokesman said: 'As a fire and rescue service we are regularly called to assist in animal rescue situations. 'This . may range from a domestic pet trapped to a major road traffic collision . involving a transporter carrying cattle and there will always be . occasions where the specialist skills and equipment of the fire and . rescue service is needed.

"By . Hugo Gye . A mother from Essex has been told that she is not entitled to a British passport because her father is not named on her birth certificate. Christine North has lived in Britain since she was seven years old, and is the daughter of a British Army soldier who met her mother while stationed in Germany. She is married to an Englishman, has done jury service twice and has voted at every election since she turned 18. But the 32-year-old is officially not a citizen of the UK because she is unable to prove that her father was in fact British. Denied: Christine North has been told she is not eligible for a British passport despite having an English father . Her mother Beate Toepke met her father, Mancunian soldier Alan Griffiths, at a British Army base in Dortmund, Germany. However, because they had a turbulent relationship, Ms Toepke did not name Mr Griffiths as Christine's father on her birth certificate. She later married another British soldier, Kevin Johnson, and moved to the UK when her daughter was seven. Mrs North, who lives in Clacton, Essex, says she regards herself as entirely British - but when she first applied for a passport, she discovered she was not entitled to one. Baffled: Mrs North, pictured left with her two daughters and right as a schoolgirl, had no idea she wasn't British . Father: But Alan Griffiths, pictured, was never named on his daughter's birth certificate . 'I was told I might not be a British citizen,' she said. 'I was dumbfounded. I was passed from passport information to border control and on to immigration. 'At one point they told me I might be deported. I was scared they would just take me away from my family one day. 'For some time I was claiming disability benefits due to a long-term health issue and they said I might have been ineligible and have to pay it all back. 'In the space of a few hours on the phone, my world was turned upside down.' Mrs North later realised that the problem was that her father was not listed on her birth certificate - even though he had paid child support while she was growing up. 'He was not put on the birth certificate because of difficulties between him and my mum,' the mother of two said. 'As far as I'm concerned I'm English. I was brought up and educated that way and have lived here from a young age.' Family: She lives in Clacton, Essex with her two children Summer-Luise, left, and Tilly-May, right . She has met with German officials in an attempt to secure a German passport so she can travel abroad, but is adamant that the law should be changed to allow her to take British citizenship. As it currently stands, Mrs North would have to take a test on 'life in the UK' in order to qualify for a British passport through residency and her marriage to Stephen, her husband of five years. She added: 'It is absolutely ridiculous that I am being told that I should take a citizenship test with questions about Shakespearean plays and naming kings and queens of old. 'I am being made to pay because my biological father was not interested in hanging around. I spoke to officials at the German Embassy and they just laughed and said, ""Why would you belong to us?"" - and they are right because I am British. 'I just want my passport and will not stop till I get one. At the moment I am stateless. I don't have a home.' Her local MP, Conservative backbencher Douglas Carswell, described her plight as 'bizarre', and has vowed to lobby the Government over the issue. 'Christine appears to have fallen through a ludicrous loophole in the law,' he said. 'She is as British as anyone here, a Clacton woman through and through, and the situation is bizarre. 'I have done everything I can, including writing in the strongest terms possible to the Home Secretary Theresa May.' 'If these rules don't allow for some human wiggle room then there is something profoundly wrong with the system. 'Anyone who knows the facts of this case knows how silly it is - but when you point this out to the officials they just shrug. It is quite insane.'","Christine North, 32, is the daughter of a British soldier and German mother .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Most experienced motorists might struggle to pass the driving test if they had to take it now, according to a survey. A total of 50 experienced drivers took a test in an experiment organised by car insurance company Direct Line, with more than three quarters of them failing. Those who failed recorded an average of three serious or dangerous faults, with one participant committing ten major faults. One experienced motorist who took part in the experiment organised by Direct Line Insurance committed 10 major faults during their mock driving test . Just one major fault, or more than 15 minor faults, can fail a candidate. In the mock test, the experienced drivers who failed committed an average of 16 minor faults, with one driver recording as many as 42. One motorist drove at 40mph in a 30mph zone, and another failed to see the kerb when doing a three-point turn. One driver even failed to spot a pedestrian by not properly checking their blind spot, forcing the pedestrian to move back onto the pavement. The vast majority of drivers were awarded minor faults for a lack of concentration behind the wheel and a lack of control over the vehicle, most commonly using the wrong gear and failing to check their mirrors. One driver received 14 minor points for misuse of gears. The majority of motorists who participated in the study run by Direct Line Insurance failed to pay proper attention to the road . Direct Line said complacent driving and a lack of concentration at the wheel could be caused by an over-reliance on in-car driving aids, such as parking sensors or blind spot monitors. Further research by Direct Line among 4,000 UK adults revealed that 68 per cent of UK drivers rely on driving aids behind the wheel, with almost half of motorists stating that they use a sat nav. Direct Line's motor director Rob Miles said: ""While drivers gain experience with age, it's easy to pick up bad habits that could be potentially dangerous and put other road users at risk. 'Driving aids are becoming increasingly common and when used correctly, can result in a safer, more-comfortable driving experience. 'However, it's important that drivers don't rely too heavily on these aids, as it can be to the detriment of both their overall ability and concentration on the road ahead.'","Candidates will fail their driving test if they commit 15 minor errors or one major mistake .

A 21-year old student has become Britain's youngest female mayor after taking her first foray into politics to launch a campaign to get tuna paninis added to her school lunch menu. Die hard Labourite Rosie Corrigan has been a town councillor in her hometown of Selby since she was 18. The left-wing campaigner even shares a love of politics with her councillor boyfriend, Will Lockwood - but unlike his girlfriend he is a staunch Conservative. Miss Corrigan said: 'It feels wonderful to be elected even if the story of how I got into politics is a bit embarrassing. 'I'm really pleased that Selby and the Council have realised it's a good idea to have a younger person as a mayor.' While other students are preparing for their summer holidays, Miss Corrigan has been hard at work attending . meetings and considering council finances. After serving on her school council - where she led the call for tuna paninis to be added to lunchtime menus -  she co-founded Selby Youth council and was a member of the UK Youth Parliament. After she'd been elected as a councillor she served as Deputy Mayor for a year. Then on May 19th, Miss Corrigan was chosen by other councillors to become Mayor. She's just finished her penultimate year of a politics degree at Hull University and is looking forward to taking on the responsibility of Mayor. She said her family and friends are incredibly supportive, particularly her boyfriend Mr Lockwood, who serves as a councillor in nearby Tadcaster.

She added: 'I just really enjoyed representing young people and getting involved in my local community. 'I was so lucky to be elected as elected as a councillor 2011 - you had to be 18 in January to register and my birthday is in December so I made it in by just a month. 'It's been great to get involved as younger member of the council. 'It really encourages young people and children to help out in their communities and get their views across.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A homeless New Jersey dad complained that his designer wardrobe of Gucci suits and Prada accessories influenced a jury into finding him guilty last month of drowning his two-year-old girl in 2011. Speaking before he was sentenced to life behind bars for tossing his daughter into a stream still strapped to her car seat, Arthur E. Morgan III said he wouldn't have worn his expensive suits if he knew he would be criticized by the media for it. He also said that the media insisted on publishing photographs of him that portrayed him in a bad light - including the moment last month when a suited Morgan , 29, winked to cameras after a jury ruled he murdered Tierra Morgan-Glover. Sentenced: Arthur Morgan III is led into Monmouth County Superior Court by Sheriffs officers for his sentencing hearing Wednesday, May 28, 2014, in Freehold, New Jersey . Morgan also apologized, but not for murdering the child. Instead, just before he was sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison, Arthur Morgan III apologized to the child's mother for the breakdown of their relationship. 'I want to say I'm sorry for the deterioration of what I thought was a beautiful friendship between the two of us that blossomed into a daughter,' Morgan told Imani Benton. 'For anybody that was truly affected by this, I hope we can all heal from this situation, knowing Tierra is in a better place.' He also said his courtroom wink following his conviction was to reassure his sister he was not upset at the verdict. Justice: Imani Benton, (right), mother of Tierra Morgan-Glover is comforted by Godsister, LaQuita Black during the sentencing hearing for Arthur Morgan III in Monmouth County Superior Court Wednesday, May 28, 2014, in Freehold, New Jersey . The girl's mother, who wore a dress embroidered with Tierra's name and photos attached to it, said she hopes Morgan suffers in prison. Murdered: Photo provided by the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office shows Tierra Morgan-Glover of Lakehurst, N.J., who was found dead in her car seat, partially submerged in a stream in Monmouth County's Shark River Park in November, 2011 . Superior Court Judge Anthony J. Mellaci said that there were no mitigating circumstances in the case and that if New Jersey still had the death penalty, 'you would be candidate No.1'. 'This child was alive when she was placed . in the water in pitch darkness, and had to suffer the unthinkable . action of having water rush in and fill her lungs while strapped into . that car seat,' the judge said. 'This child suffered before she died.' In April, the jury convicted Morgan of murdering Tierra, who lived with her mother, while on a day visit with him on November 21, 2011. During his trial the jury listened in horror as they were told how Morgan strapped his own child to her pink-flowered car seat, then tied a five-pound metal car jack to the seat and threw the literal ball and chain into a Shark River Park stream. According to the autopsy, it took up to five minutes for little Tierra to drown. The jury also heard how Morgan spent all his money on clothes but lived in the back of his 1995 Cadillac Deville. As he was handed his sentence, Morgan wore jail overalls. Prosecutors had said he killed Tierra to get back at her mother for breaking off their engagement. They said he weighed down her pink car seat with a tire jack to ensure it would sink. Emotional: A woman wipes tears off the face of Imani Benton, center, while attending a court hearing or Arthur Morgan III at Monmouth Country Courthouse, Monday, Dec. 5, 2011, in Freehold, New Jersey . Her body was pulled from a creek in Wall Township, about 20 miles from her Lakehurst home, with one tiny black and purple sneaker sticking out of the water. Bad impression: Arthur Morgan III winks at the cameras as he is lead off to jail after being found guilty of the murder of his daughter Tierra Morgan-Glover in Monmouth County Superior court in Freehold, N.J. on Thursday, April 3, 2014 . 'We finally got justice for Tierra Morgan-Glover,' said Marc LeMieuxm, first assistant Monmouth County prosecutor. 'God bless her,' added county prosecutor Christopher Gramiccioni. 'I hope she's in a better place.' The girl's relatives gasped when Morgan smirked broadly as he was led out of the courtroom after his conviction, his hands and feet shackled. Immediately after leaving the courtroom, several of them collapsed into sobs, with one woman wailing, 'Oh, God!' Defense lawyers had asked the jury to convict Morgan of reckless manslaughter, which could have seen him freed in as little as five years. Morgan's state of mind the day of his daughter's death was a key part of the case. In his opening statement, defense attorney Ryan Moriarty indicated Morgan would not deny responsibility for Tierra's death but told jurors their task was to decide 'what form of homicide applies to this defendant.' After her death, Morgan fled to California and was arrested several days later in San Diego, with a newspaper account of the killing in his pocket. The Monmouth County medical examiner said the toddler died from 'homicidal violence, including submersion in water.' Captured: This image provided by the U.S. Marshals shows Arthur Morgan III, 27, center, on floor, after he was arrested Tuesday, November 29, 2011 in San Diego . He said the girl may have been conscious for three minutes after starting to breathe in water and could have remained alive for nearly five minutes after that. Defense lawyer Jeffrey Coghlan told jurors Tuesday that Morgan believed Tierra's mother's family wasn't raising her properly and that Morgan wasn't thinking clearly at the time Tierra died. On Wednesday, jurors asked the judge for a second glimpse of Morgan's video statement to police in San Diego. In the video, a detective asked Morgan if he said anything to his daughter before leaving her to die in the creek. 'I told her I loved her, and I gave her a kiss,' Morgan replied. Morgan insisted his daughter was not dead when he left the area. 'I still heard some noises,' he said. 'I heard her. She sounded like she was crying.' He said he drove away and never returned.","Arthur Morgan III was sentenced on Wednesday to life in prison for murder of his daughter, Tierra Morgan-Glover in November 2011 .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Goods seized from criminals including a replica German armoured vehicle and a diamond Rolex watch have been sold by police on eBay. The armoured tank, which was a replica of those used during the Second World War, was confiscated by officers from David Barrett, a convicted drug dealer from Nottinghamshire. Barrett was jailed for 13 years in April 2011 for conspiracy to supply heroin and amphetamines. A replica German armoured vehicle, which was seized by police under the Proceeds of Crime Act from a convicted drug dealer . He denied the charges but was found guilty by a jury at Nottingham Crown Court. According to the ebay listing, the tank was not road worthy but was thought to have been built on a 110 Land Rover chassis and had a turbo diesel engine. The SDKFZ 222 'Helga' tank was taken under the Proceeds of Crime Act and then posted on eBay by nearby Leicestershire Police, who specialise in goods recovered under the act. The vehicle then sold on the auction site for £5,205, with the money being ploughed back into crime fighting work. The armoured car is among a number of items that have been sold by the Leicestershire force, who have raised £1million in online sales of goods seized from criminals. Other popular items have included a DB Aston Martin, which went for £63,000 and a diamond Rolex bought for £13,000. A jet ski, with a trailer is one of the items for sale on Leicestershire Police's eBay site . Anyone interested has until June 4 to place their bid for the jet ski, which has a starting price of £500 . Currently advertised on their eBay page is a Kawasaki jet ski and trailer, which has a starting price of £500 and expires on June 4. The items for sale have usually been obtained by criminals through legitimate channels, but have been paid for out of the profits of drug-dealing, fraud, or other cash-generating offences. Paul Wenlock, the head of Leicestershire Police's economic crime unit, said: 'Leicestershire Police was the first force in the country to set up its own eBay shop, and it has been a huge success. 'We have generated possibly twice as much from these sales than if we had sent the same items to auction. A diamond and gold Rolex watch, which sold on the police eBay site for £13,000 . 'The site is also a daily reminder that we will take civil as well as criminal action to ensure criminals do not benefit from their crimes. 'In some cases we have been able to seize goods and sell them where we have not managed to secure a criminal conviction. 'All the money that the site generates goes back to fund crime-fighting work. 'Often the enquiry starts from information from members of the public. If you know anyone who appears to be living a lifestyle beyond their visible means, we would like to know. They may be living on the proceeds of burglary, money-laundering, fraud or drug dealing. 'We can take both civil and criminal action to be sure they do not benefit from these activities.'","Vehicle was taken by police from convicted drug dealer David Barrett .

She is no stranger to speed, having been caught driving at 40mph in a 30mph zone in 2011, but spared punishment after writing a letter of apology to police. Originally from Hartley, Kent, Ms Frankton moved to her £225,000 detached home in Holbeach 17 years ago to be closer to her daughter. She said: ‘I had never even seen a Segway before. ‘But I just wanted a go as soon as I set eyes on it - it was amazing. My legs struggle to walk these days, so just having to lean with the handles was so easy - I wish I could get one of my own. ‘I didn't realise I could have had another go afterwards, I wouldn't have got off if I had known that At first I tried to drive it like a car, but once I got the hang of it I loved the speed.

Daughter Janet Dougill, 71, said: ‘We hired a company to organise an event that would keep all ages entertained. ‘I couldn't believe it when I saw mum - not because she was having a go on the Segway but because no-one was holding on to her. Everyone was shocked when they saw her. ‘I don't think she can quite believe it yet. Mum's birthday was on Tuesday but we were so pleased we had the party on Sunday because the weather was lovely and everyone could get outside. ‘Watching her enjoy herself on the Segway was amazing but she wasn't going too fast this time. ‘She was stopped by police for speeding three years ago but she wrote a letter to Lincolnshire police and said sorry and wasn't charged.

"By . Hugo Gye . The last letter written by Dambusters hero Guy Gibson on the day before he died has been sold at auction for more than £11,000. The RAF pilot wrote the note to his secretary Joyce Meade to thank her for helping to type the proofs for his autobiography, and enclosed a gold brooch with the Air Force's wings. But the very next day, Gibson was killed at the age of 26 when his Mosquito plane crashed during a night-time sortie over Germany. Unaware of his fate, Ms Meade replied to the letter, thanking him for the 'delightful surprise' and saying she would wear the jewellery with 'great pride'. Letter: Guy Gibson wrote this note to his secretary the day before he died in September 1944 . Gift: The RAF hero also included this gold brooch with the wings which are the symbol of the Air Force . Gibson was awarded the Victoria Cross for his role in leading the 'Dambusters' raids on the Mohne Dam in 1943, one of the best-known operations of the Second World War. The next year, he asked Ms Meade to type up his memoirs - which he had, poignantly, wanted to call The Boys Die Young. He wrote his note of thanks on September 18, 1944 - but on September 19, he went missing over Germany, and his body was later found and buried by locals in the Dutch town of Steengbergen. Gibson's death was not officially announced until nearly four months later. Hero: Gibson won the VC during the Dambuster raids but died during a mission over Germany the next day . His last letter was postmarked from 54 Base, RAF, Coningsby, Lincs, and addressed to Ms Meade's home in Balham, south London. It reads: 'My Dear Miss Meade. I am enclosing a little gift in the form of a gold RAF brooch in deep appreciation of the work you put in on my book. 'It was very nice of you to spare all the time and I'm glad to say the book is now getting passed for censorship. 'When it does get published I shall make another little gift to you so that you can buy something for yourself. 'But in the meantime all the best and thanks very much. Yours sincerely, Guy Gibson.' Ms Meade kept the letter from Gibson - as well as the reply she sent which he never received - for the rest of her life, before leaving the notes and brooch to a friend when she died in 2000. The items were sold at auction in Battle, East Sussex this week - and although the estimate was set at £300, they ended up going for a total of £11,200 including auctioneer's fees. Mark Ellin, of Burtsow and Hewett, said: 'I suppose the gift and letter was a last chivalrous act performed by Guy Gibson. They are very poignant items considering what happened to him the following day. 'Any items connected with Gibson or the Dambusters are extremely rare and are hardly ever seen on the open market. The men were held in such high regard in Britain and abroad. 'We had seven telephone bidders, but they dropped out at £3,000 and it was left to two men in the room. 'The under-bidder told me afterwards that he had to drop out - as how could he explain to his wife that he had spent £11,000 on a letter?' Collection: The brooch and letter are displayed alongside Ms Meade's reply, which was never delivered, and a copy of Gibson's memoirs entitled Enemy Coast Ahead . Mission: Gibson, centre, pictured with members of RAF's Bomber Command during the Second World War . Gibson made his name in May 1943, when he led 'Operation Chastise' aimed at destroying the Mohne and Eder dams. The RAF aces used Barnes Wallis' bouncing bomb to cause catastrophic flooding and wiping out scores of armament factories in Germany's Ruhr Valley. The next year, during an extended break from flying, Gibson was encouraged to write his memoirs, which were published posthumously in 1946 under the title Enemy Coast Ahead. Immortalised: Richard Todd playing Guy Gibson in the 1955 film The Dambusters, which dramatised the raids on Germany's Ruhr valley . Guy Gibson was the perfect choice to lead the 617 Squadron - colloquially dubbed 'the Dambusters' - even though he was just 24 at the time. He had a flawless record, leadership skills and could fly the new Lancaster. The success of the Dambusters, which wiped out the Mohne and Eder dams and seriously damaged the German war effort - made Gibson the most highly decorated pilot in the RAF. The raid became one of the best-known operations of the war thanks to the 1955 film The Dambusters, starring Richard Todd. He was awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy. Usually, former commanders moved on to senior office-based roles to see out the rest of the war after a successful raid. Army leaders and politicians encouraged Gibson to do so, as if he was captured or killed it would have seriously damaged British morale, but he insisted on retaining his place as an active pilot. He was initially posted at a Lincolnshire bomber base at East Kirkby on a strictly non-operational basis. However, after persistent pestering from Gibson, the top brass decided to let him lead a bomber squadron into Germany. On September 19, 1944, Gibson led a huge force into Germany to attack railways and industrial targets at Monchengladbach and Rheydt. He did not return from the operation in his Mosquito fighter, and mystery and controversy have surrounded his crash ever since. Gibson orchestrated the attack and ordered the bombers home, but was then never heard from again. His plane was seen plunging into the ground at Steenbergen in Holland. Part of his remains were later found, and buried where they were discovered. On their way: Gibson, second right, boards a Lancaster bomber along with other members of 617 squadron . It was long thought that he had suffered a catastrophic mechanical failure, but in recent years it has been suggested that Gibson was the victim of friendly fire. Sir Barnes Wallis, who invented the bouncing bomb, said of Gibson: 'For some men of great courage and adventure, inactivity was a slow death. Would a man like Gibson ever have adjusted back to peacetime life? 'One can imagine it would have been a somewhat empty existence after all he had been through. Facing death had become his drug. 'He had seen countless friends and comrades perish in the great crusade. Perhaps something in him even welcomed the inevitability he had always felt that before the war ended he would join them in their Bomber Command Valhalla. 'He had pushed his luck beyond all limits and he knew it. But that was the kind of man he was. A man of great courage, inspiration and leadership. A man born for war - but born to fall in war.'","Guy Gibson thanked Joyce Meade for typing up his memoirs in 1944 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The scale of boozing in Parliament has been revealed by a bar bill topping £1.4million in just two years. While the nation is being told to cut down on its drinking, MPs, their staff and visitors to Parliament downed thousands of bottles of wine, beer and spirits in 2012 and 2013. There are few signs that politicians are getting the message on curbing their alcohol intake: the Commons bars bought in 10,248 bottles of Becks and just 408 bottles of the non-alcoholic version. Parliament has revealed how much alcohol it bought in 2012 and 2013 . Parliament has bought thousands of bottles of alcohol, including House of Commons whisky, Corona lager and Malibu . A Freedom of Information request by The Times revealed that parliamentary authorities bought nearly 50,000 bottles of House of Commons sauvignon, more than 26,000 of house merlot and more than 33,000 pints of guest ale. More than 8,500 bottles of champagne were purchased alongside over 2,100 bottles of Speaker John Bercow's whisky. According to the newspaper, spending in Commons bars has gradually increased over the past three years, from just over £222,000 in April 2011 to more than £249,000 in the year to April last year, but this may reflect rising prices. It includes spending £122,931.04 on beer, £121,032.77 on spirits, £731,635.65 on wine and £458,861.00 on drink sold in the gift shops. MPs and peers are able to take guests onto the terrace of Parliament for drinks . The figures may lead to further . questions over Parliament's supposed drinking culture, which was laid . bare in the trial of Tory MP Nigel Evans, who was cleared of sex . offences. The Commons booze . culture also hit the headlines when Eric Joyce was forced to resign the . Labour whip in 2012 after fighting Tory MPs in a Commons bar. Most of the alcohol will have been drunk by the 650 MPs, 760 peers, and thousands of staff and parliamentary workers in the Palace of Westminster. The figures include 10,989 pints of Guinness, 5,448 pints of Stella Artois, 12,96 bottles of Corona lager and 10,800 bottles of Peroni Nastro Azzuro. The bars and restaurants cater for all tastes, getting through 10.5 litres of Bailer's, 463 litres of Gordon's Gin, 13.3 litres of Jack Daniels, 52 litres of Famous Grouse whisky and 4.5 litres Malibu. A House of Commons Spokesperson, said: 'The House has seen an increased number of commercial banqueting events involving external customers in recent years. 'The increasing trend is to sell more receptions than dinner events which attract higher numbers of guests and is the reason for increased consumption and sales in alcohol. 'To accommodate this increase in demand, banqueting has increased its stock for sale at such events. It is not possible to disaggregate sales or consumption by user. 'By allowing commercial events to take place, the House is able to help reduce the running cost of the House to the taxpayer. 'The cost of providing a catering service for the House of Commons is steadily decreasing. In 2014/15 the net cost of House of Commons Catering Service is budgeted to be £3 million. 'This compares with 2010/11 at £5.8 million, and £4.7 million in 2012/13. The House of Commons incurs costs for providing a Catering Service, because of the irregular hours and unpredictability of parliamentary business.'","Huge bar bill revealed for MPs, their staff and visitors to Parliament .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Avoiding parking tickets is what makes British people feel lucky, according to a new study . People who enjoy good health, avoid the traffic warden and have sex more than 120 times a year consider themselves to be the luckiest in the country. According to new research not receiving parking tickets, never being seriously ill and having sex on average twice a week is what makes British people feel fortunate. The study also reveals that six in 10 Britons say they are lucky with 83 per cent of them being in a relationship. It also found that 43 per cent of people believe they have the rub of the green because they have never been seriously ill, while 31 per cent consider themselves fortunate because they have never been ticketed by a traffic warden. However, two in five people who say they are unlucky have never done anything superstitious to turn around their luck with 61 per cent of them saying they would happily walk under a ladder. Unlucky people are also twice as likely to be single and will probably not have any children. Dr Rebecca Spelman, lead psychologist at the Private Therapy Clinic, said: 'Being classed as lucky is a question of perspective. 'It's . people's thoughts and behaviours that influence their chances of . success, which impact on how lucky they perceive themselves to be. 'They are more likely to give things a try and make good calculated risks.' The study . also found that men who think they are lucky have sex 134 times a year, . with a partner who is, on average, six months younger than them. Almost . 80 per cent also believe their partner is more attractive than them. Lucky men are also more likely to be a dog owner and 27 per cent say they are in a better job than they deserve. For . women who consider themselves lucky, they have sex an average of 110 . times a year, more than twice a week, with almost a quarter believing . they are fortunate because they have a younger sexual partner.

Over half of them also have a white front door and 26 per cent own a cat. The names of those who consider themselves the luckiest are John and Sarah, while Pauls and Sues say they are the least fortunate. The UK's luckiest city is Edinburgh but the unluckiest is Bristol. Mark Jones, of Mecca Bingo, who commissioned the research, said: 'It's great to see the nation's habits when it comes to luck and it's very positive that the majority think of themselves as lucky. 'For those that don't, it is evident there is room for improvement.'","New research shows six in ten Britons believe they have luck on their side .

"By . Amanda Williams . A pet dog called WKD was discovered so badly starved and neglected that it could barely stand, a court has heard. The dog's desperate state was only discovered when it went into another property, where a neighbour was so appalled and concerned by the dog's weak and emaciated state that he immediately called for animal protection officers. Owner Neil Urquhart, 43, has now been banned from owning dogs for five years after it was found that he failed to properly feed or exercise the female greyhound-cross. A pet dog called WKD was discovered so badly starved and neglected by its owner that it could barely stand, a court has heard . The SSPCA, which brought the prosecution at  at Dingwall Sheriff Court, said the dog's emaciated condition was 'entirely preventable'. Urquhart, of Cromarty, Ross-shire admitted being responsible for the black female greyhound-cross dog between September and December 2013 when he caused it unnecessary suffering by failing to provide nutrition, and basic grooming causing its nails to be overgrown. Depute fiscal Stewart Maciver said the dog was so emaciated it was unsteady on its feet. Mr Maciver said the dog went on to a neighbour’s property and he was concerned because the dog was so thin and weak and its nails were curling. He fed the dog before contacting the animal welfare charity. The fiscal said when the dog was taken into care by the SSPCA it weighed 7.8kgs and by February, after proper care and feeding, it had made a good recovery and weighed 12 kgs. Mr Maciver said the dog’s name was WKD. 'That may or may not be after an alcoholic refreshment of the same name,' he said. Urquhart signed the dog over to the ownership of the SSPCA on December 27. The fiscal said it was a black and white female bitch, and it looked like a greyhound but was cross-bred. Mr Maciver said when the SSPCA inspectors spoke to Urquhart he told them it had been his wife’s dog. She had taken it to a vet and had been told the weight loss was due to a liver infection. The SSPCA, which brought the prosecution at at Dingwall Sheriff Court, said the dog's emaciated condition was 'entirely preventable' Owner Neil Urquhart, 43, has now been banned from owning dogs for five years after it was found that he failed to properly feed or exercise the female greyhound-cross . 'The SSPCA went to the vet and there was no record of this visit,' he added. 'Blood tests were taken by the SSPCA and there was no evidence of infection. 'It was simply a case of the dog not having been properly fed or exercised.' Urquhart, who is unemployed and represented himself in court, told the court he had no other animals but he had signed another dog over to the SSPCA. He said the greyhound belonged to his wife but they separated. She was not allowed to keep the dog on her property and his life had taken a downward spiral, he said. He had no plans to keep a dog and did not oppose a banning order. Sheriff Andrew Miller told him: 'This is a serious offence. Up and down the country the lives of people are enriched by pets and it’s important that anyone who brings an animal into their home looks after it. Urquhart, who is unemployed and represented himself at Dingwall Sheriff Court House, told the court he had no other animals but he had signed another dog over to the SSPCA . 'In this case there was a significant failing to provide this dog with the absolute basic level of care and feeding and this is shown in these very unpleasant photographs before the court.' He fined Urquhart £200 as well as imposing a five-year ban from owning dogs under the Animal Welfare Scotland Act. Commenting on the investigation, Scottish SPCA Senior Inspector Andy Brown said: 'WKD was emaciated and very unsteady on her feet when we found her. 'We’re pleased Urquhart was given a five-year ban as the condition of the dog was entirely preventable and could easily have been avoided if she had been given the proper care she needed. 'Thankfully, WKD made an excellent recovery in our care and we have since found her the loving home she deserves.'

"By . Rob Davies . Nationwide finance director Mark Rennison said efforts to cool London's booming housing market risk holding back recovery elsewhere in the country . Efforts to cool London’s booming housing market risk holding back recovery elsewhere in the country, the finance chief of Britain’s biggest building society has warned. Bank of England governor Mark Carney recently singled out the housing market as the biggest threat to Britain’s nascent economic recovery. Scaling back the Government’s Help to Buy scheme would be one way of taking the heat out of the London market, say some experts. But Mark Rennison, finance director of Nationwide, said such measures carried their own risks. ‘If you take a position to cool the London market you can have unintended consequences in places like the North East,’ he said and added that, while some London postcodes are ‘running pretty hot’, the rest of Britain was ‘by no means outside the norm’. His comments come ahead of figures released today on the Help to Buy scheme, which subsidises mortgages. The first stage, designed to help those with little money for a deposit get on the housing ladder, applied only to first-time buyers and new-build properties. But the second phase made the scheme available to more borrowers by providing a government guarantee on part of any home loan. The data will show how popular this second phase has been. Figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders yesterday revealed that first-time buyers in the capital were borrowing nearly four times their salary to get on the housing ladder. New homeowners borrowed £2.7billion in the capital in the first quarter of 2014, up 50 per cent from the same period a year ago. Scroll down for video . Nationwide is a major beneficiary from the Help to Buy scheme, providing some 31 per cent of loans during the scheme's first phase . Mr Rennison admitted the London market was ‘clearly unsustainable in the long term’. The Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee is expected to take steps to scale back Help to Buy by introducing stricter affordability tests for would-be borrowers. But Mr Rennison told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I don’t believe that’s necessary at present,’ adding that it was ‘implausible’ that Help to Buy was behind rising prices.

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . Four years ago, the England team were setting off to a World Cup under a manager who claimed to need no more than 100 words of the language to do the job. Roy Hodgson, when asked if he had the nerve to drop Wayne Rooney, should that be necessary, replied: ‘I would like to think that,  having been a manager/coach for a long time, I have the capacity to make the decisions that are necessary.’ That’s a yes, then, courtesy of a classic Royism. There will be plenty more of those to enjoy over the next few weeks, but it is not simply the fact that Hodgson has a better vocabulary than Fabio Capello which makes this tilt at the world title different. Contrast: Four years ago the England camp was an unhappy place under Fabio Capello in South Africa . More like it: Captain Steven Gerrard watches on as Roy Hodson speaks at a press conference on Thursday . England’s camp is a positive place, feeding off the energy of young blood and low expectations as they prepare for their farewell friendly in  London before setting out for the USA and then Brazil. There are other differences. Four years ago, Capello had the FA in a fluster, first with his  ill-conceived Capello Index — an online rating  system for all players at the World Cup including his own — and then by showing interest in a job at Inter Milan. Inside the squad, there were tensions as the manager tried to lure various stalwarts from  international retirement and undermined the confidence of the goalkeepers before subjecting his players to an extreme training regime in the Alps and an isolated boot camp near Rustenburg. The hardline methods which made Capello a managerial legend did not transplant smoothly to an international tournament. He admitted this after England had crashed out to Germany in the last 16. He will not make the same mistakes in Brazil with Russia. Hodgson has experienced a World Cup as a manager. He knows more English words and has generated a healthy atmosphere, although he bristled at the idea his squad were ‘relaxed’. Not a word he likes, apparently. Perhaps it breeds complacency. Hard to understand? Capello's way didn't translate well to a major tournament . ‘If I could bottle what I’m seeing in training at the moment and release it in Brazil then I’d be a very happy man,’ said Hodgson. ‘I’ve been impressed by the attitude, enthusiasm and energy and the quality, of course.’ Unlike at the European Championship two years ago, when he took charge very close to the tournament having quit West Bromwich Albion, this is very much Roy’s caper. This is his team, his captain and his spirit. He is tapping into collective success at clubs like Liverpool and Southampton. Hodgson selected five from Anfield in his last team — against Denmark in March — and they are all available again. And he hopes Brendan Rodgers and Roberto Martinez will help him maintain the equilibrium by  allowing him to take standby pair Jon Flanagan and John Stones to Miami next week. If he does need to drop Rooney, Hodgson will do it his way, using his carefully-selected words. He  probably won’t need to. Rooney looks fit and hungry, in contrast to his demeanour in South Africa. So far so good, but Hodgson is wary of getting carried away. He will seek assurances against Peru that this team is evolving in the right way; that his direction is true.

The South Americans are not expected to be strong. They failed to qualify for the World Cup from a regional group without hosts Brazil and have important players missing, including Bayern Munich’s Claudio Pizarro and Schalke’s Jefferson Farfan. England want to go out with a bang before a big Wembley crowd — Hodgson promised to keep any experiments up his sleeve for friendlies against Ecuador and Honduras — but will not issue orders to be careful about injuries. ‘Once you start doing that, you set yourself up to be injured,’ he said. Instead, he will ask his team to stick to their principles and added: ‘We’ve been building up to get  principles of play that suit us. They’re the principles we’ll be  taking with us to Brazil. ‘We are a positive team who take the game to the opposition. We are prepared to accept the responsibility of taking the initiative in games. We don’t sit back and wait to see what happens.’ Respect: Hodgson speaks to his players during training on Tuesday at St George's Park . Ready for it: England want to go out with a bang against Peru on Friday at Wembley . Aside from this boldness, Hodgson’s natural caution is ably reflected by his captain, Steven Gerrard. ‘It’s a bit early to come out with any ludicrous shouts about how good this team is,’ said Gerrard. It is all about the opener against Italy in Manaus. Hodgson said: ‘Most important is never to take our eye off the ball. Our job is to be in peak condition on June 14. It doesn’t help a great deal if you peak 10 days before or 10 days afterwards. ‘I couldn’t have wished for a  better week, as long as the game goes well. If it doesn’t it will be a great disappointment.’","England's young camp ahead of the World Cup is a positive place .

"By . Chris Pleasance . The lost city of Atlantis may only be a legend, but if these designs are anything to go by then underwater towns could soon become a reality. This incredible 'Floating City', which spans four square miles, comes with its own dock, roadways and farms to make it completely self-sufficient. It would also feature vertical gardens, a hotel, entertainment complex and a huge floating arena which could host gigs and sports matches. The Floating City has been designed by British and Asian architects and will feature its own docks, roadways and even farms meaning it will be self-sufficient . The city will be connected above water with a series of canals meaning eco-friendly boats and submarines could provide most of the transportation . The metropolis will be made from a series of hexagonal and triangular modules which connect using walkways and tunnels both above and below the waves . The building is made from hexagonal and . triangular modules which connect together above and below the water . using a series of walkways and tunnels. The water world was dreamed up by British and Asian-based design firm AT Design Office and commissioned by Chinese construction firm CCCC. A series of canals connect the settlement together, meaning eco-friendly boats and submarines can provide most of the transportation. And for when you need to get somewhere quickly, the designers intend to fill the city with electric cars, which will prevent the underwater sections from becoming polluted. While there will be trees throughout the underwater metropolis, there will also be two designated areas of greenery for residents to enjoy. For those just wanting to visit there will be a large cruise dock to allow tourism and travel to and from the island. While trees will be dotted around the oasis, there will also be two dedicated green spaces within the city for residents to enjoy, along with panoramic views of the ocean . If construction gets the go-ahead then architects will use the same technology currently being used to build a 31-mile bridge between Hong Kong, Macau and Zhuhai . If the project were to become a reality, CCCC will use some of the same technologies they are currently using to build a 31-mile bridge between Hong Kong, Macau and Zhuhai. Siska Slavomir, architect at AT Design Office, said: 'Part of that bridge is an underwater tunnel which is joined by a 150-metre-long precast concrete box. 'The mega box is cast on a nearby island and floated to site before being connected. 'We were appointed to work with the engineer to come up with a master plan for a 10-square-kilometre floating island that can be built with the same technology. 'The project offered an opportunity to develop a new urban nucleus of world-class residential, commercial and cultural facilities, as well as to promote a zero-carbon, energy-efficient and self-sufficient city.' According to Dezeen, the proposal is now being reviewed by one of China's largest property investors, China Transport Investment Co, for a smaller scale project that could be built off of Hong Kong. In order to stop the underground tunnels becoming polluted, and to keep the city eco-friendly, citizens will use electric cars to get wherever they need to go . The designers hope the city will become a tourist destination, equipped with a dock large enough for cruise ships, and to allow transport to and from the colony .","Floating City dreamed up by British and Asian designers showing what cities of the future could look like .

"By . Sam Webb . A family had a lucky escape when their dog started a fire after turning the oven on - to try and get some freshly-baked pies. Tia, a seven-year-old Dogue de Bordeaux, sparked an emergency after she tried to get to the meat-filled pastries in the middle of the night. The red-haired dog could smell two corned beef pies, which had been baked by her owner Adam Spurr, from Hartlepool, and placed on the back of the hob. She tried to get at them by jumping up at the oven but she accidentally pushed one of the hob switches with her paw, and ignited one of the rings. Tia the dog beside the cooker she accidentally turned on while trying to get at some meat pies, filling her family's home with smoke . The first her owners knew of her antics were when they smelled smoke drifting up the stairs and into their bedroom as they slept at around 2.30am Tuesday. Adam’s partner Emma Llewellyn, 25, smelled the fumes and woke him up. Emma raced to get their children Kai Spurr, seven, and three-year-old Theo Spurr, out of their beds, and Adam, 31, went downstairs to investigate. He opened the kitchen door of their home and was met with plumes of thick smoke which were coming from the pies on the oven. He managed to fight his way through the wall of smoke and remove the smouldering pies from the kitchen. The family called 999 and within minutes fire brigade and ambulance crews arrived, with paramedics checking over Adam, who had inhaled a lot of smoke. The dog tried to get at the pies by jumping up at the oven but she accidentally pushed one of the hob switches with her paw, and ignited one of the rings. File picture . Adam said: 'We’ve been very lucky. We were really shocked when it dawned on us what was happening, I’m just so glad that we’re all alright because it could have been a different story. 'I’m really surprised Tia is still alive because the smoke in the kitchen was unbelievable, you basically couldn’t see in front of you at all. 'Tia jumps up at the workbenches all the time, that’s why the pies were at the back covered in tea towels, but she’s obviously still had a go at reaching them. 'I was gutted about my pies.' Emma added: 'With our cooker, all you have to do is press the knob and turn it, and it comes on. 'She’s put her paw on it and turned it and has ignited it. I thought I was dreaming when I first smelled the smoke.' The firefighters checked the house over and replaced a smoke alarm which had stopped working just two weeks before.

"By . Jill Reilly . Today they are picturesque scenes of tranquility, but seventy years ago these sites in Northern France were the bloody stage for the D-Day landings. With the anniversary of the Normandy Landings approaching next week, Getty Images have created a striking juxtaposition of the scenes in 1944 and now in 2014. The images show how the pretty market square of Trevieres once had the dead body of German solider splayed out across the street and how the quiet beach of St Aubin-sur-Mer was once the scene of thousands of Royal Marines marching through the waters. Next week the anniversary of the amphibious assault on June 6, 1944 will be marked with events on several of the Normandy beaches. D-Day marked the start of the European invasion during the Second World War after five years of war with Germany. Thousands of allied troops landed on the beaches in Northern France initiating the effort to liberate mainland Europe from Nazi occupation. In total 75,215 British and Canadian troops and 57,500 US troops were landed by sea on D-Day. They began an attack that lasted for eleven months and took them all the way to Germany.

"By . Lucy Crossley . The shocking neglect of drug addict parents whose five-month-old baby boy drowned in the bath while they were 'distracted' has been revealed in a new report. When father Thomas Egan found his baby son Aaron lying underwater in the tub he merely sat the tot up again and left the room, before the child once again slipped below the waterline. He was later pronounced dead in hospital, having been taken there from his home in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, in July 2010. Tragedy: Five-month-old Aaron Egan drowned in the bath while his drug addict parents were 'distracted', a new report has revealed . Thomas Egan and the baby's mother Chrystine Templeton were originally charged with culpable homicide in connection with Aaron's death but the case was dropped by prosecutors. Now a new report compiled by former Central Scotland Police chief constable Andrew Cameron has found that Aaron's death could have been prevented had he been taken into care from birth. The significant case review, commissioned by East Ayrshire’s child protection committee, found that the death of the baby, referred to as Baby E in the report, could not have been anticipated. However, it criticises the decision not to place Aaron in care, and lists further failures, including the removal of Aaron from a child protection register. Mr Cameron also details how there were chances to save the baby, and that 'accommodating Baby E at birth... would have prevented his death in these circumstances'. The death would also have been prevented 'if the parents had fulfilled their parental responsibility that night and had not left the baby on his own', the report found. Parents: Thomas Egan and Chrystine Templeton were originally charged with culpable homicide in connection with Aaron's death but the case was dropped by the Crown . According to the report, Aaron was in a portable bath in the living room, while Ms Templeton was running a bath for Mr Egan in the bathroom. Mr Egan had become aware that his son was in distress in the tub, had propped him back up again and left the room. 'The . father was fully aware that the mother was not in the living room with . the baby when he left it. The parents claimed that they had left the . baby alone in the bath and when they returned he was submerged and . unconscious,' Mr Cameron wrote, according the The Daily Record. The report also revealed how a police officer investigating the case said that 'it was clear to him that both parents were distracted'. 'The stark reality is that the death of . Baby E could have been prevented if the parents had fulfilled their . parental responsibility that night and had not left the baby on his own' East Ayrshire Council . And it revealed how Aaron's parents said they would often use the baby bath's seat to prop Aaron up so he could see the television, which they claimed stopped him from crying. Mr Cameron made 17 recommendations for . various agencies, centred on issues such as information sharing, . leadership and resources. He also criticised social workers, the police and the NHS for failing to adequately report concerns about the baby's care, and not gaining access to the family home on several occasions. Mr Cameron . said there were 'huge question marks hanging over the decision that was . taken to discharge the baby into the care of the parents'. Mr Egan also had a baby daughter who died in a bath accident in Kilmarnock in 1985. A redacted report by East Ayrshire Council’s chief officers group, responding to the independent findings, notes that the boy was the subject of a multi-agency support plan at the time of his death and that he had previously been on the child protection register. Prior to his birth, a 'high risk pregnancy referral' had been made to social workers by the midwifery service. Aaron was transferred to 'special care' when he was born in February that year and discharged home around six weeks later. Findings: Former Chief Constable of the Central Scotland Police Andrew Cameron, pictured being awarded a CBE by the Queen, wrote in his report that Aaron could have been saved, and should have been taken into care at birth . Officials decided to remove his name from the child protection register on April 26 that year after a case conference heard how the family was engaging well with the various agencies involved. Outlining the key findings of the review, the council’s report found 'an incredible amount of effort' was made to support the parents and that the baby had been progressing well under their care. But it adds: 'The independent review officer concluded that the stark reality is that the death of Baby E could have been prevented if the parents had fulfilled their parental responsibility that night and had not left the baby on his own.' It continued: 'The independent review officer recognised the complex family history and... concluded that the death of Baby E could have been prevented if he had been accommodated at birth. 'The review findings also noted that such a decision in the case of Baby E was extremely difficult given the range of factors which services had to take into account.' The review further highlighted 'missed opportunities' when professionals could have shared information more effectively about the parents’ lifestyle, taken action in response to changes in parental circumstances and made immediate decisions about their capacity to continue to care for the child. In response, East Ayrshire Council pointed to what it said were a range of improvements and developments which have been put in place to keep children safe. No disciplinary action has been taken against any staff member involved, it confirmed. Susan Taylor, chair of the child protection committee, said: 'Child protection professionals will always strive to keep children safe, and where possible, families are supported to care for their children at home. In this situation, the multi-agency child protection team put in place a package of measures to help the family care for Baby E. 'The independent review officer recognised that the child protection team tried their level best to support the family, and noted that staff could not have anticipated that this event would happen. 'This significant case review has been carefully considered by the agencies involved and there has been a determined effort to understand and learn important lessons from this incident. We are committed to working together to keep children safe from harm through continuous improvements and developments in practice.' Victoria Climbie . Abuse victim Victoria, eight, who lived in Haringey, north London, died in February 2000 after being beaten, starved and tortured by her great-aunt Marie Therese Kouao and Kouao's lover Carl Manning, who are now serving life imprisonment for murder. Victoria was burned with cigarettes, often tied up and hit with bike chains, hammers and wires, and the abuse had been noted by the police,  the social services department of four local authorities, including Haringey council, the NHS, and charity the NSPCC, as well as local churches. However, during the trial following her death a judge described the failure by all to properly investigate the case as 'blinding incompetence'. A public inquiry, headed by Lord Laming, also found there were numerous instances where Victoria could have been saved and a subsequent report made numerous recommendations related to child protection in England. Peter Connelly . Widely known as Baby P, 17-month-old Peter Connelly, died in August 2007, after suffering more than 50 injuries in just eight months, during which he was repeatedly seen by NHS staff and Haringey Children's Services - the same local authority that failed Victoria Climbie. Prior to his death, Peter had been admitted to hospital with injuries, and on one occasion, just days before his death, injuries to Baby Peter's face and hands were missed by a social worker after the child was deliberately smeared with chocolate to hide them. Peter's mother Tracey Connelly, her boyfriend Steven Barker, and Barker's brother Jason Owen were all convicted of causing or allowing the death of a child, the mother having pleaded guilty to the charge. The former director of Haringey children’s services, Sharon Shoesmith, was eventually fired on the orders of the then Children’s Secretary Ed Balls. Daniel Pelka . Daniel, four, died in March 2012 after a sustained period of ‘appalling cruelty’ during which his mother Magdalena Luczak, 27, and stepfather Mariusz Krezolek, 34, of Coventry, starved him, force-fed him salt, tortured him and locked him in a tiny room. At the time he died he had been tortured for six months and weighed just 1st 9lb, the same as an 18-month-old child. A review following his death also found that chances to save Daniel, who had gained the attention of social services and police - who visted the home 26 times, had been missed, but did not blame any individual agency.

George Groves, who took to America his campaign for his second shot at Carl Froch, is refusing to sign-on for a second re-match should he win at Wembley. As he prepares to box in front of a record 80,000 crowd, Groves has vetoed a contract clause for a third Battle of Britain. Groves roused a clamour of public support when he petitioned the IBF to impose Saturday night's mandatory defence on Froch but is unwilling to make the same commitment in return. No third meeting: George Groves will not offer Carl Froch a rematch if he wins their second fight on Saturday . Relaxed: Groves is confident he can right the wrongs of the first fight and beat Froch to become world champion . Froch smiles wryly at being ordered by the IBF — whose world super-middleweight title he holds — to oblige his young challenger. The irony is not lost on him that Groves has insisted on deleting from the multi-million-pound contract a clause providing for a third fight in the event that he wins this time. Froch says: ‘Accidents can happen in the ring but it’s interesting that George won’t offer me another rematch if he gets lucky. And while I’m fighting him again he never gave a second chance to Kenny Anderson.’ That is a reference to the Commonwealth super-middleweight title fight in 2010 to which Anderson came as a late substitute with a few days’ training. Anderson shocked Groves with an early knockdown before being stopped in the sixth round. His calls for a rematch with time to prepare went unheeded. One time only: Groves opted not to have a rematch with Kenny Anderson after beating him in Manchester . Second time around: Froch beat Mikkel Kessler in their rematch at the O2 Arena last May . Groves can argue Anderson lapsed into amphetamine use soon after. But that remains the only defeat on the Scot’s 19-fight record; he has since won the British title. Another fight between them would not have reached the magnitude that is gripping the nation this weekend. Can Froch-Groves II live up to expectations, equal or surpass the excitement of five months ago? Both men believe so. Groves says: ‘This will be a great fight, even if it is one Carl cannot win in the end. I will knock him out in the third.’ Froch says: ‘George is getting stopped. Probably in the mid-to-late rounds but sooner if he tries to fulfil that early prediction.’","Groves vetoes a contract clause for a third Battle of Britain .

Magpies are known as scavengers, predators and opportunistic thieves, which are attracted to shiny and brightly coloured objects. The birds are surrounded by superstition and were once thought to be in league with the devil. Numbers of the birds have quadrupled across Britain and Northern Ireland over the last 35 years with the increase most significant in suburban areas. They live and scavenge in parks, gardens and bushland. The birds can become aggressive during the breeding season, usually between August and November, when they will often attack passers-by.","Bird was filmed hitching a ride by recruitment agent Stefano Capacchione .

An inquest heard he had checked on his . daughter several times during the night but found her unresponsive and . not breathing in her bed at about 3am. She was rushed from her home in Stourport, Worcestershire, to Worcestershire Royal Hospital by ambulance where she tragically died. Stourport Coroners' Court heard yesterday how her death may have been triggered by a fit brought on by the chickenpox. But Worcestershire deputy coroner Marguerite Elcock concluded Nicole died of unknown natural causes. A pathologist was unable to provide an exact cause of death. After the hearing, Mr Murphy and his partner, Clare Rush, 29, spoke of their loss and told how they wanted to raise awareness of the complications that can be caused by the virus. A coroner recorded a verdict of death by unknown natural causes . Mr Murphy said: ‘We need more awareness that chickenpox is not just a harmless childhood illness. ‘I had no idea it could cause the shut-down of organs, I thought the worst thing was it'll scar if you scratch them. ‘I just can’t comprehend how my daughter could have died of something that doctors describe as a simple illness. ‘Nicole had been suffering quite badly and over the night, I kept hearing heavy breathing on the monitor and checking she was okay. ‘She seemed to be just sleeping, but on the last time I came back to check I found she wasn't breathing. We did what we could. ‘We came here looking for answers but we still don't really know for sure how she had died. ‘My son is missing her massively. The children have become clingy, they try and cheer me up over it, but it's so hard for all of us.’ Ms Rush, a carer, added: ‘I've heard of parents deliberately holding chickenpox parties where they bring their children into others who have the virus because they say it is better to get it as a child than an adult. ‘But I hope this might urge others to think twice about these sort of things. ‘She only broke out in spots the day before and we gave her Calpol like the doctors told us to do. But within 24 hours she was dead. ‘We are absolutely heartbroken that we have lost our little girl but we don't want other mums and dads to go through the same.’ The inquest heard how Nicole had been developed chickenpox, along with her sister Jenna, two, and five-year-old brother, Preston. In 2008 Fabio Alves-Nunes, five, died after suffering from a severe bout of chickenpox . But unlike her siblings, Nicole . suffered a severe bout of the illness and was heard to have heavy . breathing by her father who checked on her through the night. Paediatric . pathologist Dr Nikola Ostojic said he could not confirm the cause of . Nicole's death but did say there was some evidence of pneumonia and a . cyst in her brain. Mr Murphy sobbed during the hearing as the coroner told him he had done everything he could to help her. She said: ‘Things came to a head when she stopped breathing and you had to call an ambulance. Fabio died of multiple organ failure after he developed toxic shock, a type of blood poisoning . ‘That happened quickly - from being a generally poorly child with chickenpox to stopping breathing. ‘You . did absolutely everything you could to get some help, but . unfortunately, having been taken to hospital, Nicole could not be saved. ‘It may be that Nicole was very poorly with chickenpox and as a result she may have had an epileptic fit.’ Nicole was not the first child to die after developing chickenpox. In 2008, five-year-old Fabio Alves-Nunes died after suffering from the illness. He developed the illness very severely and died of multiple organ failure after he developed toxic shock, a type of blood poisoning. Chickenpox is usually a mild but infectious disease. It takes seven to 21 days for the symptoms to show after infection and people are infectious from two days before the rash appears until roughly five days after. Around 95 per cent of children catch chickenpox before the age of 16, and for most it's a mild illness leading to itching, blisters and sometimes a high temperature . After having chickenpox the body usually develops an immunity, which stops people getting it again. Most doctors recommend rest and lotion to soothe itchy spots.","Nicole Murphy, from Stourport, developed chickenpox in December 2013 .

The struggle was caught on camera by American photographer Andrew Lee, 52, of Irvine, California. He spotted a flock of caspian terns hunting for food close to his Californian home. 'I spotted several terns circling around a particular area of the lake,' says Mr Lee. 'I followed one of them with my camera and suddenly the tern dived into the lake and came up with a big carp. 'I kept following the bird as it flew up with this fish thrashing wildly in his beak. 'The fish was able to break free and for a split second it looked like it was flying through the air, pursued by the tern - it was a precious moment.' Mr Lee was able to watch from just 60 metres away as the struggle took place. Spending only ten seconds flying through the air, the carp almost completes his great escape, before he is caught by the tern at the last moment. The bird continues his journey with the fish securely in his beak . Mr Lee says: 'The tern had a hard time trying to stay in the air as they fish was obviously very heavy for him to try and control. 'He tried to flip the fish over so he could swallow it, head first, and I happened to capture the moment when the fish was flying in the air. 'Most people, including myself, have never seen a flying fish with a tern in hot pursuit behind. 'We were all surprised to see how big the fish was in relation to the tern. 'It was a very special moment to capture and to share, and I would like to share with others the wonders of our beautiful world.'","The series of snaps were taken at El Dorado Lake in Long Beach, California .

The American businessman will long be remembered as the Florida-based millionaire who took United in to private ownership nine years ago via a highly-leveraged buy-out, plunging the club more than £500million in debt. Though Glazer Snr has been ill for some time and has left the running of United to sons Joel and Avram for the majority of the family’s ownership period, he was the man who drove the purchase of the club against the wishes of United fans over a two-year period in the early part of the last decade.

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . A Monet painting that hung in the Fifth Avenue apartment that reclusive heiress Huguette Clark left all but abandoned for twenty years sold at auction Tuesday for $27 million. 'Water Lilies' Monet's 1907 rendition of his beloved garden in Giverny, France, went to an undisclosed Asian buyer in the season-opening auction of impressionist and modern art at Christie's. The painting, part of Clark's collection since 1930, has not been publicly exhibited since 1926 and the millionaire herself likely never saw it during her final two decades that she spent in a Manhattan hospital. Scroll down for video . Selling her collection: A Monet painting owned by the late reclusive heiress Huguette Clark opened a landmark Christie's auction of big name works by high profile collectors in New York on Tuesday . Not too shabby: Bid master Andreas Rumbler looks impressed during the auction, in which Monet's Water Lilies fetched an impressive $27 million . Nympheas as it's known in French was one of around 250 paintings the impressionist made of his beloved gardens . Christie's is selling hundreds of items from Clark's collection after a feud over her estate was settled in the fall. Starting May 6, Christie's began a series of sales as the estate of the mysterious millionaire, who died in 2011 aged 104, is divided up. Among the 400 items of fine art, rare manuscripts and collection of beautiful musical instruments, are lots expected to reach many millions dollars. Some of the items included in the collection, which was started by Miss Clark's father, are so rare that Christie's has exhibited them at its auction houses in Tokyo, Hong Kong, and London, as well as in New York. Miss Clark was the last surviving child of Senator. William A. Clark, who was born in a log cabin and became one of the wealthiest men of his day.He is the namesake of Nevada's Clark County and established its county seat, Las Vegas. A onetime socialite who became a social shadow, Miss Clark died at 104 in 2011. She had a penthouse and two other apartments on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue and exquisite homes in Santa Barbara, California, and New Canaan, Connecticut, but she chose to spend her last 20 years in a hospital. She couldn't even see it: The world class work of art hung in the dining room of Clark's Fifth Avenue apartment, which she all but abandoned in her final 20 years . Clark was a collector as well as an artist herself. Pictured is a self-portrait the heiress made in her 20s . The art collector also loved music, and several of her instruments are included in the auction, including 6ft tall Louis XV-style concert harp, which is expected to go for $3,000 to $5,000. A collection of rare and valuable paintings collected by the art lover are also being offered at auction. They include three Renoirs, including one Miss Clark bought for $125,000 which is expected to sell for $10 million, and a waterlily painting by Monet, which has not been publicly exhibited since 1926. Miss Clark bought the 1905 painting, Nymphéas, in 1930 and it spent the next 80 years hanging in the dining room of her sumptuous Fifth Avenue apartment. It is expected to attract up to $35 million when it is sold on May 6, along with the Renoirs. Eye for art: Renoir's Chrysanthèmes was also part of the auction . American great: Girl Fishing at San Vigilio by John Singer Sargent from the Clark collection, is to be sold in June . Collection: This 1875 Renoir was expected to sell for up to $5 million . Decorative arts: This George I walnut and beech armchair from 1725 was estimated to sell for $60,000 to $90,000 . A Stradivarius violin given to Huguette by her father. It is one of several the Clark family have owned . A William Merritt Chase painting, A Water Fountain in Prospect Park, expected to fetch $1 million, and John Singer Sargent’s Girl Fishing at San Vigilio, which is estimated to make more than $3 million, will be auctioned in a later sale on June 18. Miss Clark didn't just admire art, she painted herself. A self-portrait and her palette will be included in the sale of the family collection. The June auction, An American Dynasty: The Clark Family Treasures, combines the bulk of the heiress's extensive collection of books, instruments and paintings. A 16th Century, beautifully illustrated copy of Book of Hours, and a first edition of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass, printed in Brooklyn in 1855, are among the highlights of the book sale. The Book of Hours is expected to sell for at least $40,000 and the Whitman is anticipated to go for $100,000 to $150,000. The entire sale is expected to make about $70 million, and some of the proceeds will go towards a settlement from the disputed will between Miss Clark's nurse and her distant relatives. With no close relatives, Miss Clark left a roughly $300 million estate and a swirl of questions about the input she had received from a close circle of caregivers and advisers, and about the extensive gifts and bequests she had given them in return. She signed two wills within six weeks at age 98, the first bequeathing her riches mostly to about 20 distant relatives and the second cutting them out. The September settlement mainly benefited arts institutions and the distant relations. Some of Miss Clark's real estate and possessions had already been sold. A 2012 Christie's auction of 17 pieces of her jewelry, including a pink nine-carat diamond ring, brought in about $21 million.","The painting was one of the French Impressionist's famous Water Lilies series .

"By . Joshua Close . Tottenham fans may be wondering who new boss Mauricio Pochettino will sign as the club look to break into the Premier League's top four next season. The 42-year-old joined the White Hart Lane outfit from rivals Southampton on Tuesday after an impressive 18-month spell with the south coast club. The Argentine guided Saints to eighth this season as he strengthened the squad with three additions at the start of campaign. Here at Sportsmail we review Pochettino's hattrick of signings at St Mary's and what type of players the Spurs faithful may expect in the future. Shrewd business: Mauricio Pochettino made three signings at Southampton before joining Tottenham . Victor Wanyama . Signed for £12.5m on a four-year-deal from Celtic in July 2013. He scored zero goals in 24 appearances in all competitions. Kenyan endured an injury-plagued debut season. Pochettino signed the influential midfielder after the young Kenyan had impressed during the previous campaign with Scottish Champions Celtic. The 22-year-old managed to score nine times in the 2012-13 season, including one against Barcelona in the Champions League. The £12.5million transfer fee was the highest amount that a Scottish club had received for a player, showing just how much belief Pochettino had in Wanyama. The midfielder's first season with Southampton was a relatively quiet one in comparison to his final one in Glasgow. Injury-plagued: Victor Wanyama made just 24 appearances for Southampton in all competitions this season . Midfield enforcer: Wanyama (left) was signed from Celtic for £12.5million on a four-year-deal in July 2013 . The Kenyan suffered a serious injury in December 2013, during a match against Aston Villa - chipping a bone in his lower leg. The subsequent incident meant he did not to return until February. With his season ruined with injuries, Wanyama failed to score a single goal for Southampton and will be hoping to be more successful next season. Pablo Daniel Osvaldo . Southampton's record signing at a fee of £14.6m from Roma in August 2013. Scored three goals in 13 appearances. Fined £40,000 and banned for three matches in January for a touch-line scuffle at Newcastle in December. Loaned out to Juventus in January after breaking team-mate Jose Fonte's nose in a training ground fight. The signing of Osvaldo turned out to be a very controversial and problematic one for Pochettino. Osvaldo arrived in England with a bad reputation, having in the past had bust-ups at former clubs. The Italy international had previously punched Roma team-mate, Erik Lamela, in the face for not passing him the ball during a match. Osvaldo also had a training ground bust-up with Nicola Mingazzini whilst they were at Bologna. The forward had seemingly put his troubles behind him when he grabbed his first goal for Southampton during a 2-0 win against Crystal Palace in September. The Good: Dani Osvaldo (left) scored three goals in 13 appearances for Southampton this season . The bad and the ugly: Osvaldo was loaned to Juventus after breaking team-mate's Jose Fonte's nose . The 28-year-old’s troublesome past soon reappeared though as he was fined £40,000 and banned for three matches in January after getting involved in a touch-line scuffle at Newcastle in December. Just weeks later Osvaldo found himself in yet another training ground fight and ended up breaking the nose of Southampton team-mate, Jose Fonte. Osvaldo was subsequently sent out on-loan to Juventus for the remainder of the season and is likely to leave Southampton permanently during the summer. Dejan Lovren . Signed for a fee of £8.5m from Lyon in June 2013. Scored two goal . s in 31 appearances. Part of Southampton defence that kept 15 clean sheets all season. Arguably Pochettino’s best signing during his time at Southampton, Lovren has impressed a lot of people with his defensive performances this season. The Croatia international was a vital member of a Southampton defence that managed to keep 15 clean sheets throughout the campaign. Lovren was also impressive at the other end of the pitch, with one of his two goals coming at Anfield to give his side a historical 1-0 win over Liverpool. Rock solid: Southampton defender Dejan Lovren (right) was signed from Lyon for £8.5million in June . Headed home: Lovren (right) scored the only goal as Southampton claimed a 1-0 win at Liverpool in September . The centre-back may have had an even better season had he not been ruled out for a few weeks in January, after suffering ankle ligament damage. His performances mean Southampton may have a fight on their hands to keep Lovren at the club, with Liverpool, Manchester United and Roma all believed to be interested in the 24-year-old.","Mauricio Pochettino signed a five-year deal to become Tottenham boss on Tuesday .

"By . John Drayton . Manchester City defender Dedryck Boyata has signed a new two-year contract. The 23-year-old Belgian’s previous deal was due to expire this summer.

"By . John Mcgarry . Southampton have sounded out Oscar Garcia about a possible move to St Mary’s – with Celtic so far reluctant to grant the Spaniard his dream switch to Glasgow. Garcia, the former Maccabi Tel Aviv and Brighton manager, last week told Sportsmail of his desire to succeed Neil Lennon in the hot seat in Glasgow’s East End. Malky Mackay, Owen Coyle, Henrik Larsson and Steve Clarke have also been linked with the Celtic post together with Michael Laudrup, whose representatives were asked earlier in the week if the job would be of interest him. Up for the job: Garcia, who left Brighton after narrowly missing out on promotion, has put his name forward for the Celtic role . Roy Keane is also in the running for the job and bookmakers yesterday were cutting the odds on the fomer Manchetser United captain. Celtic’s problem in recruiting Lennon’s successor appears to be the reluctance of some potential candidates to show their hand – with the current vacancies at Southampton and West Brom muddying the waters. The south coast club are now compiling a shortlist for the successor to Spurs-bound Mauricio Pochettino and last night they broke cover to ask ex-Barcelona midfielder Garcia if he would be interested in talking to them. It’s believed, however, that Garcia’s preference would be a crack at the Champions League with Celtic. Laudrup and Mackay are also thought to be on Saints’ chairman Ralph Krueger’s short-list together with Lennon, Ronald Koeman, Murat Yakin, Steve McClaren, Gus Poyet and Rafael Benitez. Garcia, who resigned from Brighton after missing out in the semi-finals of the Championship play-offs, is also attracting interest from Malaga. Double act: Will Michael Laudrup (left) be united with Morten Wieghorst at Celtic? Laudrup has an offer from Primera Liga strugglers Granada but has so far not committed. Keane’s link to the managerial vacancy at Celtic surfaced again last night following a flurry of bets placed on the Irish assistant manager. The odds on Keane being appointed as the next Celtic supremo were dramatically slashed from 33/1 to even money – one firm, BetVictor, went 8/11. While betting indicators are not always reliable, Sportsmail understands that Keane is firmly on the radar of the Parkhead hierarchy. Republic of Ireland manager Martin O’Neill has predicted Keane will return to front-line club management and has stated he would not stand in his way should his right-hand man express a desire to move on. Keane is due to speak to the media at the Aviva Stadium later today ahead of Saturday’s friendly against Italy at Craven Cottage. It’s likely one item will dominate the agenda. Winning pedigree: Laudrup won the Capital One Cup with Swansea in 2013 . Earlier this week, Keane spoke of his admiration for Celtic, for whom he played half a season for at the end of his career, but declined to push himself forward as a candidate. ‘They are a brilliant club, an absolutely fantastic football club, one of the best in the world. But I have got a job,’ he said. Since becoming Irish assistant manager, Keane has been linked with jobs at Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest, as an assistant to Louis Van Gaal at Manchester United, and now Celtic. His profile has also risen with his ITV work where his presence guarantees high ratings. Celtic’s major shareholder, Dermot Desmond, is a close friend of O’Neill and has direct access to discussing Keane’s suitability for the Celtic job, if required. The FAI refused to comment on the rising speculation.

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . On the day that Andy Murray played his first Grand Slam match since Ivan Lendl’s exit from his coaching box it was interesting to note the presence of a former Wimbledon champion seated several rows behind the support team that remains. Amelie Mauresmo, the winner at SW19 in 2006, braved the chill wind to spend the whole match watching him defeat Kazakhstan’s Andrey Golubev 6-1, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 and stayed to watch the on-court interview afterwards too. She was only yards away from Murray’s girlfriend Kim Sears and, amid all the speculation about who will be brought in to replace Lendl, you could only wonder if she might become another significant woman in his life. Watching on: Former Wimbledon champion Amelie Mauresmo watched Andy Murray in action on Tuesday . According to one credible source Mauresmo and the British No 1 have been talking about the post, and while the only person who can make the choice is Murray himself, the idea of him bringing her on board in some capacity might not be totally fanciful. Murray, who has always been prepared to think outside the tramlines, is on record as saying that he would consider a woman as his coach, which some thought might be a reference to Martina Navratilova. Yet Mauresmo actually has experience of coaching a man. In 2010 she worked with the experienced French player Michael Llodra and she knows the pressures of being a world No 1, having also won the Australian Open. Currently she works as France Fed Cup captain, which takes a few weeks per year, and she is also in close contact with the game through work in the French media. Murray has hinted that he has identified someone he would at least like to try out. Last night he was vague about his plans while suggesting that something might be in the air. ‘It’s not something that’s distracting me right now, so it’s not been a problem so far,’ he said. Focused: Andy Murray returns a powerful backhand on his way to victory over Andrey Golubev . Making his point: Murray celebrates winning a valuable point during his first round match . He will need focus when he plays Australia’s Marinko Matosevic, the world No 66 who is not keen on his nickname of ‘Mad Dog’. He defeated German-Jamaican Dustin Brown in four sets. Matosevic is unlikely to be as awkward a prospect as Golubev, who lived up to his reputation as a flashy groundstroker whose mix of dramatic winners off both sides, coupled with copious shanks, gives his opposition so little rhythm to play with. After missing last year with a back injury this was Murray’s first French Open appearance since winning the Olympics, US Open and Wimbledon, which ought to make him more comfortable. There has also been back surgery to ease the problems largely associated with playing on clay. Frustrated figure: Murray reacts after one of his shots is deemed out of play during Tuesday's en . Apart from Golubev his biggest irritation yesterday was the overhead cable camera, which kept moving while he was trying to serve. That shot caused him problems in the third set, when he was broken three times. Otherwise it had been a highly impressive beginning and a fairly comprehensive end, although there were times when he should have been more aggressive, as Lendl always advised. ‘I was excited to be back after what happened last year,’ he said. ‘I came here a few weeks ago to practise with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and after that I was looking forward to it even more.’","Andy Murray beat Andrey Golubev in first round at French Open .

A disastrous night for Andy Robinson’s Bristol included a serious ankle injury for former Wales captain Ryan Jones. Jones, parachuted into Bristol’s team from Ospreys this month, fell awkwardly at a line-out and had to be carried off some 28 minutes into a match which saw Welsh, relegated last season, win by three tries to one. Opener: Nick Scott of London Welsh breaks clear from George Watkins of Bristol to score his team's first try . Jubilant: Scott celebrates with team-mates at the Kassam Stadium in Oxford . Robinson, the former England and Scotland coach charged with guiding Bristol back to the Premiership after a five-year absence, had no complaints afterwards. Though disrupted by injuries to Jones and scrum-half Luke Baldwin in the first half, Robinson praised Welsh for completely outplaying his team. He said: ‘I’m disappointed but London Welsh played very well, we managed to stem the tide a bit in the last 20 minutes otherwise it could have been a lot more than 19 points. ‘They completely outplayed us and played the conditions very well. It’s a huge challenge but we have got another game to go.’ Bristol go into next Wednesday’s second leg needing to quickly cut down Welsh. They did lead through a fifth-minute try from flanker Marco Mama, following a line-out drive, only to be outgunned in the next 30 minutes. Welsh struck back through another try off a line-out drive by prop Nathan Trevett to be followed by an outstanding score from wing Nick Scott. Brick wall: Ralph Koster of Bristol is tackled by Carl Kirwan of London Welsh . Scott raced clear from halfway after good interplay by scrum-half Chris Cook and hooker Nathan Morris. Welsh led 17-5 at half-time and a third try, early in the second half, by flanker Carl Kirwan increased the margin. Gordon Ross converted that scored and later a penalty to complete a 12-point contribution. Bristol gained some hope for next Wednesday in the final minutes when substitute fly half Adrian Jarvis added a penalty. Justin Burnell, Welsh’s head coach, warned afterwards that his team had won nothing yet. ‘There is still a long way to go yet and another match to play.

Warren Sapp said 'one time for my owner & great man £RipBoss', while Derrick Brooks wrote: 'Deeply saddened by passing of Mr Glazer. 'So many good memories of him as my owner of the only team I played for @TBBuccaneers. £ripmrglazer' Current Tampa Bay players had their say as well. Defensive end Da'Quan Bowers wrote: 'RIP TO MALCOM GLAZER, a man and family that gave me an opportunity to live out a dream and has been in my corner since DAY 1 RIP BOSSMAN.' Tributes also came from some of Glazer's fellow franchise owners. Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross said in a statement: 'I was deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Malcolm Glazer. In his corner: Tampa Bay defensive end Da'Quan Bowers said 'RIP BOSSMAN' in a touching note on Glazer . 'He was a Super Bowl champion, a true innovator and pioneer that cared about his family, the community and his team.' New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft said: 'Malcolm Glazer was a very good man who I admired. He was known as a great businessman. He made everything he ever invested in better, including his community, where he invested in many philanthropic endeavours. 'I was always inspired by his love and devotion to his wife, Linda, and his commitment to his family. He was so proud of his children, Avie, Kevin, Bryan, Joel, Darcie and Edward. I loved that he always put his family first. 'I offer my sincerest sympathies to Linda, his six children and 14 grandchildren, as well as the many friends and extended family who are mourning his loss today. He will be missed dearly.'

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple is preparing to turn the iPad into a universal 'home remote' that could control everything from TVs to washing machines and lights, it has been claimed. The project is set to be unveiled alongside an entirely new version of Apple's iPhone and iPad software at its Worldwide Developer Conference in San Francisco next week, according to the FT. An Apple patent published in November last year gave the first hints of the system, showing a system that automatically turned on lights when a user comes home. The new system is expected to work with existing home automation products such as the Philips Hue connected lightbulbs . The app could turn the iPad into a universal remote . It is believed the firm is already working with home automation firms to ensure their gadgets work with the app. The firm already sells home automation gadgets in its stores, including including arch rival Google's Nest thermostats, Dropcam wireless cameras, Philips Hue lightbulbs and Belkin WeMo switches. The firm is also expected to unveil a major overhaul of both its iPhone and Mac software at the event. One improvement is believed to be giving the iPad a new split screen mode so users can run two apps at once, it has been claimed. The move will be a major change to the way the iPad handles multiple applications. However, the tablet will not be the first with the feature - and Microsoft even made the iPad's lack of split screen functionality the subject of a recent ad. 'iOS 8 is likely to supercharge the functionality of Apple’s iPad with a new split-screen multitasking feature, according to sources with knowledge of the enhancement in development,' claims the blog 9to5Mac. 'These people say that the feature will allow iPad users to run and interact with two iPad applications at once.' Current users can swap between apps, but can only see one on screen at a time. The new feature is also likely to enable users to drag information - text or pictures, for example, between apps. The blog also claims the feature may also be key to a larger-screened iPad, which Apple is actively developing for a launch either later this year or in 2015. Scroll down for video . Set to be called Healthbook  the app is expected to be included in a new version of Apple's iOS software that will launch alongside its health-tracking wristband. Apple is also expected to unveil a major new app for the iPhone and iPad aimed at collecting health data at the conference - as well as possibly unveiling Dr Dre and Jimmy Iovine as its latest employees if the much rumoured acquisition of Beats goes head. Called Healthbook, the new app is expected to be unveiled in June at Apple's annual developer conference. It offers everything from food and sleep tracking to blood sugar level analysis - and can even tell how much water you've drunk. The app is set to work with Apple's iWatch, which is believed to be set to be announced later in the year - although it could be unveiled at the same event next year. Martin Hajek also believes Apple will release a lower cost plastic version of the watch, which will come in several different colours . Apple is also set to show off a redesigned version of the Mac operating system, at a keynote address on June 2nd. Earlier this year, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said the iWatch could generate $17.5 billion in sales in the first 12 months — more than the iPhone or iPad did in their first year. That was assuming Apple priced the watch around $299 and had a similar customer base to the iPad.","Would turn iPhone and iPad into universal remote .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . From sleepless nights to mountains of equipment, parents have a lot to contend with when they bring a new baby home. But now a car seat has launched that transforms into a buggy so parents have one less piece of kit to carry – or at least in the boot of their car. The Doona has legs and wheels that fold up beneath it in a single motion, converting the stroller into a car seat. Easy does it: A clever car seat that transforms into a buggie (pictured) has been designed so that parents have one less piece of kit to store - at least in the boot of their car . USP: The Buggie folds up in a single motion from a stroller to a car seat. Folding it back into a chair is a four-step process. Size: The push chair has a height of 39inches (99cm) but is as small as 23inches (60cm) tall and 17inches (44cm) wide when it is folded up. It is designed to free up boot space in cars . Weight: 15lbs (7kg) Colours: Seven, including a bright pink and sky blue . Price: £299 . It weighs 15lbs (7kg) and can be used as a seat in cars and aeroplanes, while two simple manoeuvres convert it back into a pushchair. To unfurl the chair, parents need to undo a clip and pull upwards. Collapsing it again is slightly more labour intensive as there are four steps. While there are plenty of ‘compact’ options, deigned to free-up boot space, they all require that pieces un-clip and wheels have to be separately stowed. Un-clip and go: To unfurl the chair, parents need to undo a clip and pull upwards (illustrated). Collapsing the buggie again is slightly more labour intensive as there are four steps, but the contraption is designed to be used by one parent . But Doona’s folding mechanism is designed to be simple so it can be operated by one parent without any complications. The Israel-based company, Simple Parenting, designed the convertible chair to ‘simplify the lives of parents and their babies’. Founder Yoav Mazar named the product after his daughter, Danielle. ‘When my wife and I had our first daughter, we felt the need to spend as much quality time with her and took her everywhere. While we understood the importance of protecting her, the day-to-day use of infant car seats and strollers was agonising. ‘From my small designer’s workshop, I set a clear goal in mind: To transform the infant car seat into something safe yet simple and practical. This was the idea behind Doona.' The Doona costs £299 and is available in seven colours. Clever: The Doona's folding mechanism is designed to be simple so it can be operated by one parent without any complications. The seat is padded and the wheels cleverly fold up in a way that means they will not leave much mud on a car seat .","The Doona is designed to be used by one parent and can unfurl into a pushchair in one action after a clip has been unfastened .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . We might think of quirky fruit beers made in small, independent breweries as a modern trend. But in fact the practice goes back 9,000 years when high-ranking cavemen drank brews which included fruit and strange ingredients such as pine resin. Unlike in modern times, alcohol was considered to be sacred and was used in ritual ceremonies, new research suggests. Hold the glasses: Alcohol was considered to be sacred and were used in ritual ceremonies, new research suggests. Fossils and skeletons revealed evidence that elite people drank fruit wines, mead and beer made with barley and oats, much like the pints we consume today (pictured) Alcoholic residues suggest that ancient Eurasians drank fruity wines, beer made from barley and wheat and mead. They also consumed fermented drinks made from dairy products. The making of alcohol seems to originate in China in around 7,000BC. People living in the Zagros Mountains of north-western Iran were drinking wine made with pine resin in 5,000BC. Scientists have discovered a professional winery in south-eastern Armenia dating from 4,000BC. Experts think that the wine was made for mortuary practices as there were 20 graves and a number of cups unearthed nearby. Dr Guerra-Doce thinks that alcohol and drugs were only used by people of high social standing in the vast region. Fossils and skeletons revealed evidence that elite people drank fruit wines and beer. Elisa Guerra-Doce, a prehistory expert at the University of Valladolid in Spain told Live Science that the archaeological record of prehistoric Europe shows that people used mind-altering substances. As well as historical accounts by ancient Greek writers, archaeologists have found macrofossil remains with mind-altering properties and some designs in tombs could have been inspired by altered states of consciousness. Dr Guerra-Doce looked at macrofossil remains of psychoactive plants, residue from fermented alcoholic drinks, chemical compounds left on skeletons and artwork showing drinking scenes in a bid to piece together how alcohol and drugs were used in Eurasian prehistory. Alcoholic residues suggest that ancient Eurasians drank fruity wines, beer made from barley and wheat and mead. They also consumed fermented drinks made from dairy products. While the making of alcohol seems to originate in China in around 7,000BC, 2,000 years later, people living in the Zagros Mountains of north-western Iran were drinking wine made with pine resin. And scientists have discovered a professional winery in south-eastern Armenia dating from 4,000BC. Experts think that the wine was made for mortuary practices as there were 20 graves and a number of cups unearthed nearby. Some pottery fragments contained residues of beer and wine from burial sites and settlements. High ranking people in ancient Eurasia occasionally drank to excess.  Alcohol and drugs were considered to be sacred and were used in ritual ceremonies, new research suggests. Here, a figurine known as the 'Poppy Goddess' (centre) is thought to have been used in the taking of opium . Dr Guerra-Doce said: ‘Many tombs have provided traces of alcoholic drinks and drugs. I think these substances were used to aid in communication with the spirit world.’ Some artworks, such as a figurine known as the ‘Poppy Goddess’ show that drugs were also used ceremonially. The figurine was found in a chamber in Crete thought to have been used by cult members. She has three moveable hairpins shaped like poppy capsules, which hint at how opium might have been extracted by people. Her serene expression suggests the trance-like state ancient people may have entered into by inhaling opium fumes. Dr Guerra-Doce thinks that alcohol and drugs were only used by people of high social standing in the vast region. ‘The main evidence to support that idea is the archaeological contexts where they have been found: tombs of high-status individuals and restricted ceremonial places,’ she said. ‘I think that prior to a large-scale production, alcoholic drinks were reserved for special events and they played a similar role as drug plants.’ But as larger scale wineries and breweries became more common, alcohol found its way into the hands of average people, who largely used it for hedonistic rather than ritualistic purposes.","Alcohol was considered to be sacred and was used in ritual ceremonies .

"By . Bianca London . She is set to play Heather Watson in the second round of the French Open today but it seems that Simona Halep has done more than step up her training regime to be at the top of her game. In her teens Simona, 22, the current Romanian No. 1 who is ranked number 4 in the world, underwent a breast reduction to improve her tennis. Aged 18 she announced she was having her breasts reduced . from a 34DD to a 34C because they were slowing her reaction time. Tennis pro Simona Halep, 22, who is playing Heather Watson in the second round of the French Open today, underwent a breast reduction to improve her game four years ago . Perhaps it has helped. Simona landed a spot in the world's top 50 at the end of 2012, won her first 6 WTA titles, and was named both the WTA's Most Improved Player and ESPN Center Court's 2013 Most Improved Player. 'It has been an important part of her career,' Fissette, a Belgian who used to coach Kim Clijsters, told The Independent. 'I guess it was the right decision. I did not see her then. I have seen some photos, but she took that decision and it was a good one. I understand that. 'Also in the Belgian newspapers it is the same thing. That’s why she was famous. Let’s hope she will win a Grand Slam and then they will start talking about the Grand Slams and not something else.' But not everyone was in support of Simona's surgery choice. South African beach volleyball player . Alena Schurkova launched a big-boob-pride campaign in 2010 after hearing the news. She argued: 'If she does this, it sends out the message that girls with . big boobs can't play sports, and that is just wrong. 'I . am 32E, and I have never found them to be a problem. I could be double . what I have and I would still be okay to . perform.' Dr Puneet Gupta, Cosmetic Doctor at The . Private Clinic of Harley Street, the first doctor in the UK ever to . offer a non-surgical technique for breast reductions said: 'For professional athletes who maintain intense training regimes, these problems will of course be felt far more heavily. 'Training . for long hours each day will only intensify the discomfort, meaning the . size of their breasts won’t just get in the way of them exercising, but . it can also affect their downtime away from sport, because it may take . longer for them to rest and recover if they are still in pain in the . back and breast areas. 'Over . the years the inability to exercise or take part in sport has certainly . become a more commonly cited reason for patients I see who are . seriously considering undergoing a reduction.' Before and after: At the age of 18, Halep had her breasts reduced from a 34DD, left, to a 34C, right, because they were slowing her reaction time . Dr . Gupta says that medical advancements may also have contributed to the . growing number of female athletes undergoing breast reductions. 'Now . there are non surgical breast reduction methods that exist, which can . allow women to undergo a reduction with very limited downtime. 'For . females who train regularly or are actively involved in sport, but are . being prevented from doing so because of the size of their breast, a . minimally invasive reduction technique could be a feasible solution, . reducing the amount of time they would need to take away from sport to . recover. He does, however, warn of the dangers of breast reduction in young athletes, many who are under the age of 25. 'It’s . important to note though that a breast reduction won’t be suitable for . everyone. It is actually a procedure which is most suited to . post-menopausal women, so a very young athlete, for example, might not . be suitable for treatment,' he adds. While there's no suggestion that U.S. gymnast . Alicia Sacramone has any qualms, many gymnasts are pushed to be as . breastless for as long as possible to help their career . Last year, it was widely reported that female athletes believed that the . development of breasts could seriously hinder their careers - and could . even prevent them from reaching Olympic standard. According to ESPN magazine, . gymnasts push themselves to the 'brink of starvation' to avoid . developing breasts and a host of professional athletes have spent a lot . of money to surgically reduce them. 'For . the modern athlete, the question isn't whether breasts get in the way . -- it's a question of how to compete around them', the magazine reported. ESPN writer . Amanda Hess cites female Ultimate Fight Championship competitor Ronda . Rousey's fight in February as a perfect example of a female athlete . being hindered by her breasts. Legends surrounding women's breasts affecting their sporting prowess have circulated for years. One such legend suggests that female Amazons cut off the right breast to hurl spears and shoot arrows more efficiently. Once Rousey flipped her opponent to the floor she . quickly rushed to adjust her sports bra straps - a move that ended in . disaster. 'I got kicked straight in the chest right as I was trying to adjust my bra,' Rousey told Hess. 'You don't see big titties in the Olympics, and I think that's for a reason,' she added. Joan Ryan, author of the 1995 expose . of gymnastics and figure skating, Little Girls in Pretty Boxes, wrote . that elite gymnasts would undereat and overtrain to delay menstruation. 'You can't afford to have a woman's body and compete at the highest level,' she said. Dominique Moceanu, who at 14 was the youngest competitor on the 1996 gold medal USA Olympic team . added: 'The sport pushes us to be breastless little girls as long as . possible. But though breasts were forbidden, privately we longed for . them.' Ronda Rousey (left) has spoken out to say: 'You don't see big titties in the Olympics, and I think that's for a reason' It has been found that when in motion the nipples of a C or D-cup breast can accelerate up to 45 mph in one . second, which is faster than a Ferrari . In 1995, a controversial CBS golf . analyst called Ben Wright told a newspaper that 'women are handicapped . by having boobs. It's not easy for them to keep their left arm straight. Their boobs get in the way.' And Wright may have a point. Judging by research, women do seem to be held back - especially by larger breasts. A third of women taking part in the 2012 London Marathon with cup sizes ranging between . AA-HH reported breast pain from exercise; eight per cent even said the pain . was 'distressing, horrible or excruciating'. A typical A-cup breast weighs 0.43 of a pound and every additional cup size adds another 0.44 of a pound, according to research. ESPN also reported that when in motion the nipples of a woman who has C or D-cup . breasts can accelerate up to 45 mph in one second, which is faster than a . Ferrari. Paul . E Banwell, Consultant Plastic, Reconstructive and Cosmetic Surgeon at . The Banwell Clinic said: 'Large, heavy breasts can have significant . physical and psychological effects on a lady's wellbeing. 'Pain, . discomfort, and interference with physical activities can affect all . women's daily lives and especially elite sportswomen. 'I . view this very much as a quality of life procedure that leads to . immense patient satisfaction.

"By . Mark Prigg . Disease-causing bacteria can linger on surfaces in commercial airplane cabins for up to a week, researchers have found. They say the seat-back pockets and armrests are particular hotspots for germs. The team found E-Coli and MRSA bugs can survive for several days. Scroll down for video . A major airline carrier supplied researchers with material from armrests, plastic tray tables, seat-pocket cloth, window shades and metal toilet buttons for the study . A major airline carrier supplied researchers with material from armrests, plastic tray tables, seat-pocket cloth, window shades and metal toilet buttons for the experiments. In the study researchers simulated the temperature and humidity levels typically found during commercial flight. MRSA survived the longest -168 hours -on material from the seat-back pocket, while E. coli O157:H7 lived for 96 hours on the material from the armrest. Kiril Vaglenov, a graduate student in Auburn University's Department of Biological Sciences, conducted a two-year study -funded through the Federal Aviation Administration’s Airliner Cabin Environmental Research Center -to determine how long E. coli O157:H7 and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, would survive on commonly touched surfaces under typical airplane conditions. A major airline carrier supplied researchers with material from armrests, plastic tray tables, seat-pocket cloth, window shades and metal toilet buttons. 'Our data show that both of these bacteria can survive for days on these surfaces, particularly the porous material such as armrests and seat-pockets,' said Vaglenov. 'Air travelers should be aware of the risk of catching or spreading a disease to other passengers and practice good personal hygiene.' In order for bacteria to be transmitted from a cabin surface to a person, it must survive the environmental conditions in the airplane. The study was presented this week at the annual meeting of the American Society for Microbiology. In the study Vaglenov simulated the temperature and humidity levels typically found during commercial flight. MRSA survived the longest -168 hours -on material from the seat-back pocket, while E. coli O157:H7 lived for 96 hours on the material from the armrest. 'The point of this study is not to be alarmist, but to point out to the airlines the importance of providing a sanitary environment for travelers,' said Professor Jim Barbaree, director of the study and mentor for Vaglenov. Beware of the bugs: Researchers say seat-back pockets and armrests are particular hotspots for germs. They team found E-Coli and MRSA bugs can survive for several days in aircraft cabins.

"By . Andrew Levy Education Reporter . Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw said Labour's policy of grade inflation has allowed education chiefs to 'fool themselves' into thinking standards have improved . Labour's policy of allowing exam grades to rise despite poor educational standards was savaged by the chief inspector of schools yesterday. Sir Michael Wilshaw said the education authorities had been ‘fooling ourselves’ for years that standards were improving because grades were going up. In fact, the UK has fallen well behind other nations in terms of educational attainment - particularly Asian countries. Sir Michael made the comments ahead of the launch of Ofsted’s annual report in which he revealed 1.75 million children were being let down by poor schools. It provided yet another hammer blow to Labour’s education legacy following two major reports that revealed glaring gaps in English children’s schooling. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘Grade inflation has taken place in our schools and the Secretary of State is dealing with the issue. ‘There is no question that grade inflation has been operating in our schools. We have been fooling ourselves.’ Andreas Schleicher, of the OECD, said in October that research showed young adults in Britain have more qualifications than their grandparents but not greater abilities. This showed there had been grade inflation and that qualifications did not necessarily mean better skills. Ofsted’s report warned 250,000 children are languishing in failing schools and another 1.5 million are stuck in primaries or secondaries rated as requiring improvement. Sir Michael called on the government needed to re-introduce national curriculum tests for seven and 14-year-olds, saying it had been a ‘mistake’ for Labour to phase them out. In a thinly veiled attack on teachers who complained of spending time on the tests, he said this had been done to pander to ‘vested interests’. ‘Talk to any good headteacher and they will tell you it was a mistake to abolish those tests. That’s because good teachers use those tests to make sure every child learns well,’ he said. ‘In getting rid of the tests we conceded too much ground to vested interests. Our education system should be run for the benefit of children and no one else. Sir Michael called for the return of tests at the ages of seven and 14, speaking ahead of the launch of Ofsted's annual report which reveals 1.75 million children are being let down by poor schools in England . ‘If we are serious about raising our standards and catching up with the best in the world, we need to know how pupils are doing at seven, 11, 14 and 16.’ Children’s performance is already monitored at 11 with maths and reading tests, as well as one on spelling, punctuation and grammar, and at 16 in GCSEs. A reading test has also been introduced for six-year-olds. Sir Michael said the tests should be marked externally as inspectors have found ‘worrying inconsistencies’ in teachers’ own assessments. English and maths lessons were a particular problem, with a third of lessons rated less than good by inspectors between 2009 and 2013. A greater emphasis was needed on spelling and handwriting in English and time should be devoted to allowing pupils to read for pleasure. Maths questions were too simple and needed to be more demanding, with children taught not just how but why solutions were reached. He also revealed inspectors will be sent into schools with no notice from January to stamp out ‘horseplay’ in the classroom and instil a respect for learning. At present teachers are informed one day in advance, giving them the opportunity to remove disruptive pupils from classrooms or bribe them to keep quiet. In future, complaints from parents or teachers will be enough to trigger a visit. The report, based on 8,500 inspections from 2012 to 2013, described run-down schools where there is ‘litter in the playground and disorder in the corridors’, untidy classrooms, chewing gum on carpets and uniform policies that pupils routinely ‘flout’. ‘Around 700,000 pupils attend schools where behaviour needs to improve,’ he said. ‘Unless this changes, teachers will struggle to create an environment in which all children learn well.’ The report found a record eight out of ten schools were now rated good or outstanding. But it said three factors were hindering progress - mediocre teaching and leadership which allows misbehaviour to flourish, regional differences in the quality of education and underachievement of poor children, particularly among white pupils. It repeated his suggestion for a ‘national service’ of teachers and headteachers who can move into failing schools or areas for up to two years to turn them around. Sir Michael said: ‘There are unmistakeable signs that England’s education system is gradually improving. ‘If our destination is the high peaks of a world-class education system and the economic benefits that follow, we are now in the foothills.’ A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Ofsted is right to place a high premium on good behaviour.’","Sir Michael Wilshaw said education chiefs have been 'fooling themselves' that standards are rising because grades have been improving .

"By . Mike Dawes . Scottish Rugby has announced a 'multi-million pound' sponsorship deal with BT. The four-year partnership with the broadcasting giants will see the national stadium in Edinburgh renamed as BT Murrayfield Stadium. BT will also sponsor the Scotland sevens side, Scotland's domestic league and cup competitions and Scottish Rugby's four new academies. The name game: A BT sponsorship deal will see Murrayfield renamed . 'This is a momentous day for Scottish Rugby,' the union's chief executive Mark Dodson told Scottish Rugby Union's official website. 'We are very proud to bring BT back into our family of sponsors on a size and scale that is unprecedented both for Scottish Rugby and, we believe, Scottish sport. 'While the headlines may be dominated by the naming rights of the stadium, today's announcement underlines BT's alignment to our own values and goals, particularly that rugby clubs are the heart and soul of their communities that offer a welcome to all, young and old, boys and girls, men and women. 'This new funding underlines our desire to deliver more opportunities for young people to take up our game and broaden the reach of rugby across Scotland. 'We will invest the monies that we receive from BT alongside the revenues that come from our other partners to continue our plan to grow the game of rugby throughout Scotland and deliver against our strategic plan and our recent policy paper initiatives, in particular the establishment of a robust academy structure and to enhance the standard of club rugby.' Lucrative: BT will also sponsor the Scotland sevens side and the domestic league and cup competitions . Scottish Rugby's director of commercial operations, communications and public affairs, Dominic McKay, said: 'We are delighted to have secured such a renowned and respected global partner. BT recognises the importance and the rich heritage associated with Murrayfield and Scottish Rugby. 'In branding our home, the BT Murrayfield Stadium it reiterates our joint view that the name of the home of Scottish rugby that has been synonymous with the game in our country since 1925 had to be retained. 'BT is a massive global brand, which we've worked with before as sponsor of our domestic league and cup competitions between 1999 and 2006. We also have the pleasure of working with BT Sport, which began its relationship with us at the start of this season, as it sponsors both Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Rugby. 'To secure a deal of this nature for the first time in our history means a huge amount for Scottish Rugby, as it will deliver very positively for us for years to come to enable us to continue to invest in our game throughout Scotland. 'I wish to place on record our thanks to RBS for their tremendous support of our domestic competitions and the Scotland sevens squad over the last three years and very much look forward to continuing to work with them as national team sponsor. 'We will be working closely with BT and their staff throughout Scotland in the coming months as we bring this new relationship to life.' Donald Macleod, president of the Scottish Rugby Union, said: 'Congratulations to the executive team on securing such a great deal for the whole of Scottish rugby. From Stornoway in the north to Selkirk in the south, this welcome investment comes as a very positive development for the entire game.'

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . It’s an age old question: What is more fuel efficient when driving a car and trying to keep cool, having the air conditioning on or the windows down? For years people have tussled over which uses more fuel, with most of the opinion that having the windows down is better up to a certain speed, when drivers should then switch to air conditioning. However, studies suggest that having the windows down could be the best solution at all speeds - and the air conditioning never needs to be turned on. Air conditioning versus rolling the windows down: which makes your car more fuel efficient? Previously it had been thought it was better to switch to air conditioning at higher speeds, but new research suggests it might always be better to roll the windows down and never touch the air conditioning button . Basic physics suggests that air conditioning should perform better at higher speeds. A car’s air conditioner is essentially powered by the engine - most cars have a compressor system driven by a belt. Some people around the world known as ‘hypermilers’ consider themselves professionals when it comes to maximising car fuel efficiency. They do this through a number of methods that may seem slightly odd to some. This includes keeping the windows up and the air conditioning off. But some go to rather more extreme measures, such as wearing ice vests to keep cool. They are also known to tailgate large vehicles to get in their slipstream and keep fuel use down. Others do their best to avoid braking at all costs or even turn off their engine while moving. When driving at slower speeds, the small but continuous effect of having the air conditioning on means the car’s engine works harder, and thus more fuel is used. At speeds of 70 miles (110 km) per hour on a motorway, however, it is often said that the effect of air conditioning on fuel efficiency is negligible when compared to having windows open. Depending on speed, having air conditioning on at a medium level can reduce the fuel efficiency of a car down by up to 10 per cent, according to Vox. At slower speeds it makes more sense to have the windows open to cool the car down - air easily circulates from outside to inside the car without causing too much drag. As speed is increased, however, the air resistance on the car also increases, meaning the engine has to work harder to maintain the car’s speed down the road as it becomes less aerodynamic. So, at higher speeds air conditioning is surely the winner - at least, that’s what was previously thought. But new research by Vox suggests this is not the case. A 2004 study by the Society of Automobile Engineers found that Sedans used more fuel when air conditioning was on than when windows were down. Note the axis on the left is gallons per mile, so a higher number is worse performing . As a car's speed increases, so too does its air resistance. A car travelling at 70 miles per hour experiences four times as much drag as one travelling at 35 miles per hour. This might suggest it is better to have the windows up, but research shows that air conditioning is worse for fuel efficiency even at these speeds . Taking a look at previous studies, they found that it was actually more efficient to have the windows down for any speed expected on a road. In 2004, for example, the Society of Automobile Engineers found that both SUVs and Sedans were considerably less efficient at all speeds up to 70 miles (110 kilometres) per hour when using air conditioning over having the windows down. A test by popular American TV show Mythbusters, meanwhile, found similar results. This is despite the fact that drag doubles as speed increases - for example, a car travelling at 70 miles per hour will have twice as much force pushing against it than one travelling at 35 miles per hour. The reason is that air conditioning eats up more fuel that previously thought, while the effects of drag by having a window open are not as bad as most think. So it seems the solution to being both fuel efficient and keeping cool as the weather heats up might be to leave the air conditioning off, and crank the window open just a bit. Of course, if you really want to be fuel efficient you might decide to forego both having the air conditioning on and rolling your windows down - you’ll just have to bear the heat while driving. The Society of Automobile Engineers found the effect was even more pronounced in SUVs, where air conditioning became less and less efficient at higher speeds .","Website Vox has taken a look at debate of air con vs rolling windows down .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Tom O'Neill, pictured with his daughter Lucy, was struck down by the rare condition Guillain-Barre Syndrome after suffering a bout of man flu . A teacher who was left paralysed after a bout of 'man flu' has taught himself to walk again. Tom O'Neill, from Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, picked up a runny nose and cough from one of his pupils. When he complained about feeling under the weather, his wife Hayley told him to stop exaggerating his symptoms. But within days, the maths teacher's condition had deteriorated. Mr O'Neill, 27, found himself unable to move his legs, and the paralysis crept across his body, rendering him unable to move. He slipped into a coma while in hospital, as doctors worked to determine what was causing his body to shut down. They discovered Mr O'Neill's cold had triggered a rare nerve condition, Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) - which normally develops from a virus or infection and affects just 1,500 people a year in the UK. Remarkably Mr O'Neill has battled back from the illness, and after re-learning to walk, he is preparing to return to work. He said: 'I thought I just had a bad cold - my wife and I even joked it was a bad bout of 'man flu'. 'It did get quite bad and I went to a couple of walk-in centres, but the staff there just told me I had a virus, so I thought I'd best man up. 'Normally I'm a fit and healthy guy. I play loads of sport and stay active. I very rarely get sick but I turned out to have pneumonia in one lung and then the GBS started. 'I gradually lost all the feeling in my hands and feet, then my legs and forearms. 'But then it got the point where I was almost completely paralysed. I was gasping for air. 'It was so scary - I don't even remember a lot of my early time in hospital. 'The nurses told me it was one of the most severe cases they'd seen but it was also one of the fastest recoveries they'd witnessed because I was in such good shape before.' The 27-year-old started to feel ill last October but put his condition down to a cold. But within days he was admitted to hospital and slipped into a coma as his immune sytem began to attack his body . Doctors diagnosed Guillain-Barre Syndrome, a rare but serious condition which affects the body's nervous system. The maths teacher was forced to re-learn how to walk as a result of the illness . His wife Hayley (pictured) suspected her husband was exaggerating his symptoms. She said: 'It just sounded like man flu and I thought he would go to work and get over it. But then when things started to get worse three days later I had an instinctive feeling that something wasn't right' Mr O'Neill began to feel unwell in October 2013 but, as an active dad who lifted weights and played football and squash regularly, he thought one day in bed would be enough to recover. But when he had failed to recover a few days later, he decided to take a day off to get back to strength. Far from getting better, he deteriorated dramatically and within a week of his first sick day he was no longer able to move and was admitted to hospital. Guillain-Barre syndrome (pronounced Ghee-lan Bar-ray) syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the nerves that control the body's senses and movements. It affects about 1,500 people in the UK every year and is slightly more common in men than women. It causes the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) to attack these nerves, causing them to become inflamed. The exact cause of GBS is unknown, but most people - around 60 per cent of sufferers - develop the condition shortly after having a viral or bacterial infection. The symptoms of GBS usually develop between one and three weeks after a minor infection. They often start in your hands and feet before spreading to your arms and legs. Initially a person suffering the condition may experience:- pain, tingling and numbness- progressive muscle weakness- co-ordination problems and unsteadiness . Weakness is likely to affect both sides of the body and gets worse over several days. Around 80 per cent of people make a full recovery within a few weeks or months, and do not have any further problems such as permanent nerve damage. Source: NHS Choices . In order to let his body recover, doctors sedated him and he remained in a coma while his terrified wife waited anxiously for a diagnosis. Once doctors had ruled out all other possibilities they started pioneering treatment for GBS. They discovered the condition had developed from the pneumonia in one lung, the illness Mr O'Neill had labelled 'man flu'. Just under two months later, he had to start the long road to recovery in rehab by re-learning to walk. Fortunately, he was one of the lucky sufferers who make a full recovery and since leaving hospital on Valentine's Day - more than three months on from being admitted - he has gone from strength to strength. He is back playing squash, taking his daughter to the park, and will be back teaching later this month. Mr O'Neill added: 'I missed my first Christmas with my daughter but had my first day release from hospital for my daughter's first birthday. 'Wanting to get back to my wife and daughter, and all the kids at school, was such a big motivator to work on the physio in rehab. I just wanted to be back to normal and forget the nightmare. 'My head teacher came to visit me and told me all the kids had been asking after me so I went back to see my classes for a day visit when I came out of hospital. 'I can't believe I'm going back to work soon - it's such a relief.' Mrs O'Neill, said: 'When Tom said he had a cold I thought it was nothing serious - it just sounded like man flu and I thought he would go to work and get over it. 'But then when things started to get worse three days later I had an instinctive feeling that something wasn't right. 'When he started to lose feeling in his legs it was so scary and frightening. 'I'll never dismiss man flu again. Any little thing has me thinking it must be really serious. The 27-year-old has battled back to regain his fitness and is preparing to return to his job as a teacher later this month. His wife Hayley, said: 'I'll never dismiss man flu again.' 'If he says he's got a headache I get really worried and quiz him: ""Are you ok? Do you need to get checked out? Is there something seriously wrong?"" 'Now he can't stop me fussing.' Consultant neurologist Dr John Winer, an expert on GBS who works with the charity Gain, said: 'GBS is caused by your immune system attacking the nervous system instead of just fighting an infection. 'We think the damage is due to antibodies reacting with the precipitating infection which causes peripheral nerve damage. 'In 75 per cent per cent of cases there is a history of infection and that can be caused by either bacteria or a virus. 'We can normally identify which infection GBS developed from in half of all cases. 'But we don't understand it completely and we're not entirely sure what has caused the GBS in all cases. 'There are hundreds and hundreds of infections which are incriminated as triggers although some are more likely than others.'

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . It can be easy to judge someone based on their taste in music. Heavy metal-fans, for instance, are often thought to share a common sense of alienation, oppression and anger, with their music giving them an outlet for their rage. It’s a stereotype that’s reinforced by the genre’s roots with metal gaining popularity throughout the 1960s and 1970s in economically ravaged, deindustrialised areas. But while heavy metal may have once . appealed to alienated working-class males, today the music enjoys its . greatest popularity in the most advanced, wealthy, and knowledge-based . areas of the world. This map tracks the number of heavy metal bands per 100,000 residents using data from the Encyclopaedia Metallum. It shows how the genre holds less influence in the post-industrial places of its birth, but remains extremely popular in wealthy, safe and stable Scandinavian countries . Writing in City Lab, Toronto-based Richard Florida highlights a map that tracks the number of heavy metal bands per 100,000 residents using data from the Encyclopaedia Metallum. It shows how the genre holds less influence in the post-industrial places of its birth, but remains extremely popular in wealthy, safe and stable Scandinavian countries. Some people believe the dark, cold days of northern Europe reflect heavy metal’s emotional darkness and fury. Some people believe the dark, cold days of northern Europe reflect heavy metal's emotional darkness and fury accounting for its popularity in the region. Pictured is Swedish metal band Opeth . Mr Florida, and his Martin Prosperity Institute colleague Charlotta Mellander, examined the connections between heavy metal and a range of economic and social factors to uncover a pattern. They found that the number of heavy metal bands per country was linked with the nation’s economic output, level of creativity and entrepreneurship. A higher share of adults that hold degrees, as well as better levels of human development, well-being, and satisfaction with life, were all related to a larger fan base for heavy metal. Ms Mellander, who is Swedish, claims Scandinavia’s love for heavy metal bands is directly related to the government's efforts to put compulsory music training in schools. This, she claims, has created a generation able to meet metal’s technical demands. ‘While new musical forms may spring from disadvantaged, disgruntled, or marginalised groups,’ added Mr Florida, ‘It is the most advanced and wealthy societies that have the media and entertainment companies that can propagate new sounds and genres, as well as the affluent young consumers with plenty of leisure time who can buy it.’ Heavy metal music fans are often labelled as angry and unruly - but how close is this to the truth? A study by Westminster University has attempted to find out by digging deep into what makes metal aficionados tick. Psychologist . Viren Swami asked 219 women and 195 men living in the UK to fill out . surveys about their personality after listening to and rating 10 heavy . metal tracks. The . research, published in Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the . Arts, focused on contemporary metal music characterised by heavy guitar . riffs, double-bass drumming, complex rhythms and extreme tempos. By . matching music preference to the personality traits, Professor Swami . found that ‘openness to experience’ was a major factor in enjoying heavy . metal. Perhaps . more surprising however, was the fact that those with a strong . preference for metal were more likely to have lower self-esteem. Metal heads also had a higher-than-average need for uniqueness, and lower-than-average levels of religiosity.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Wind turbines and solar panels have often been touted as the solution to the growing energy crisis, but could the answer really lie in the movement of water and air? That’s what one company based out of Maryland thinks - The Solar Wind Energy, Inc. has recently been given permission to build a giant downdraft tower. Known as the Solar Wind Energy Tower, it would stand nearly half a mile (0.8 kilometres) tall and generate as much power as the Hoover Dam. Scroll down for video . The Solar Wind Downdraft Tower (artist's illustration shown) is the first hybrid solar-wind renewable energy technology on the market. The patented structure is comprised of a tall hollow cylinder with a water injection system near the top and wind tunnels containing turbines near the bottom . The tower works by spraying water in at the top, making air heavy and causing it to fall, which causes 120 huge turbines to turn at the bottom. At peak operation, during a particularly sunny day, the tower can apparently produce 1,250 megawatt-hours - roughly equivalent to the power output of wind turbines spread over 100,000 acres. But the main advantage of this system, according to the company, is that it can run day and night and it does not rely on particular weather, such as wind or sunshine, to operate. Downdraft technology is not entirely new, but the company claims they have an innovative new patent that makes it more feasible. One of the biggest drawbacks was the sheer size and cost of attempting to construct such a tower. But now they have been given permission to begin the funding and operation of the project in San Luis, Arizona. The company also hopes to export the technology to other countries including Chile, India and the Middle East. Water is sprayed in at the top of the structure, which stands 2,250 feet (685 metres) tall, almost twice the height of the Empire State Building. This causes hot air to become heavy, and it then falls through the tower. At the bottom of the tower are 120 turbines, with the ability to circulate 2.5 billion gallons of water. As it falls through the tower the air reaches speeds of up to 50 miles (80 kilometres) per hour. This runs the turbines and produces power, some of which is used to pump water back to the top. The exterior of the tower could also have ‘wind vanes’ that would capture wind and use it to produce additional electrical power. This makes it, according to the company, the first ‘hybrid solar-wind renewable energy technology’ on the market. The system can run 24 hours a day, but it does require large amounts of water. It also needs to be in an environment with hot air, which is why the Arizona desert is ideal. One possible stumbling block could be the cost of the project, which is estimated to be about $1.5 billion (£890 million). However, Solar Wind Energy have been granted preliminary funding by National Standard Finance, which should make the project feasible. On their website, the company outlines their goal of eventually building multiple towers and providing a new source of renewable energy. ‘Each Tower will be constructed on location using conventional materials, equipment and techniques, associated industries, as well as local workers in the surrounding town or city,’ they write. ‘Each location will benefit significantly from the creation of professional manufacturing, construction and transportation jobs, in addition to having a high efficiency energy resource close by – providing clean renewable energy at a cost more favourable than nuclear plants with no negative impacts to the environment.’ At peak operation, during a particularly sunny day, the tower can apparently produce 1,250 megawatts per hour - roughly equivalent to the power output of wind turbines spread over 100,000 acres and about the same as the Hoover Dam in Nevada (pictured)","Permission has been granted to build the Solar Wind Energy Tower .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Nowadays, gadgets and equipment are becoming increasingly complex and technical, but scientists have proved when it comes to microscopy - less is more. Foldscope is an origami-based print-and-fold optical microscope that can be assembled from a single sheet of paper. There are 30 versions, each built with varying filters and stage configurations designed to look for specific diseases, such as malaria. The Foldscope, pictured, was created by Stanford University and all the components and lenses are embedded into a single sheet of paper. The 30 versions are each built with varying filters and stage configurations, designed to look for specific diseases, such as malaria . A designer recently created a $10 (£6) DIY microscope using wood, glass and a smartphone. By fitting a block of wood with a plate of plexiglass and the lens from a laser pointer, the design lets users make a microscope with 175x magnification for an iPhone. Once the project is completed, the smartphone can be used to take photos of things as small as the nuclei of plant cells as well as for macro photography projects. The assembly of the rig requires basic DIY skills, including the use of a drill, as well as a few nuts and bolts. For example, malaria samples require a higher level of fluorescent filters. Foldscope was designed by Prakash Lab, a research group in the Department of Bioengineering at Stanford University. All the components, including micro optics, are embedded into the sheet of paper. There are three stages - the optical stage, the illumination stage and the mask holding stage. Once folded, there is room to place a sample slide, before these built-in stages are used to illuminate and magnify objects up to 2,000x. It can accommodate standard glass slides, 3-inches (75mm) long, by 1 inch (25mm) wide, but Prakash said the kits come with plastic slides to improve safety. There are three stages in the paper - the optical stage, the illumination stage and the mask holding stage. Once folded, there is room to place a standard glass sample slide before these built-in stages are used to illuminate and magnify objects up to 2,000x . These are a selection of images captured by the Foldscope including (pictured left to right) Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma cruzi, Giardia lamblia, Leishmania donovani and E. Coli and Bacillus. The Foldscope can accommodate standard glass slides, but also come with plastic slides . The paper the Foldscope is built into doesn’t feature instructions; instead it has a colour-coded key that helps anyone, speaking any language to build the Foldscope. During a TED demonstration, Prakash stood on the Foldscope and threw it around to prove how rugged it is, and because it is portable, a light can be shone through the lens to project images onto any surface. This diagram explains how Prakash Lab was able to make the Foldscope so affordable. Each of the parts, listed in the table in the top left-hand corner, costs less than $50 (30p). This image also reveals how the different components fit within the paper . A resolution test, made using the Foldscope, shows a micron in the left-hand image and two micron beads in the right image. Researchers claim the Foldscope can be stood on and because it is portable, a light can be shone through the lens to project images onto any surface . Since the goal is to strip out all the complexity, Prakash said each specific foldscope provides one kind of imaging capability: either bright-field, reflected light, dark-field, polarization, fluorescence and projection microscopy. Each microscope also has a fixed magnification and corresponding resolution optimised for the application. The researchers are recruiting 10,000 beta users to test the microscopes in a variety of settings before looking to manufacture it on a wider scale.","Foldscope is a print-and-fold optical microscope assembled from paper .

"By . Chris Pleasance . The last remaining women code-breakers who operated Colossus - the world’s first computer - have been reunited after 70 years after a picture of them was published in a local paper. The women were all part of the Colossus C Watch at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire during the Second World War and were the world’s first computer operators. Most of them lost touch with each other after the war ended and they have not been together as a group for seven decades. This rare picture, taken at Bletchley where photography during wartime were strictly forbidden, shows the female code breakers. (Pictured: 1. Margaret Mortimer, 2. Margaret O-Connell, 3. Lorna Cockayne, 4. Margaret Kelly, 5. Joanna Chorley 6. Betty Warwick) Today: Six surviving women reunited after 70 years next to a replica of the Colossus machine which they operated . Their reunion happened after a rare picture of the Women’s Royal Naval Service was discovered in a drawer by veteran Joanna Chorley, 88, from Bucks. The photo, which was taken at the end of the Second World War, shows around 40 women dressed in smart berets and ties. It is believed to be one of only a handful in existence as photos were not meant to be taken at Bletchley Park during the war years. The huge Colossus computer was designed to break German ciphers used to encode messages between Hitler and the rest of his high command . Vital work: Women played a variety of roles from lowly clerks to operating machines and breaking into ciphers and codes . The women . spotted themselves in the photo after it was published in the national . papers to mark the 70th anniversary of Colossus. They . gathered together at Bletchley Park, where they were shown a . fully-functioning Colossus Mark II, which was rebuilt and unveiled in . 2007. Joanna . Chorley said: 'In war time you weren’t really meant to take photos so I . kept it very safe in my bureau, but I had forgotten all about it and . only found it when I was looking for something else. 'It was lovely to see everyone and be all together again after such a long time.’ It . was on 5 February 1944 that Colossus Mk I tackled its first . Lorenz-encrypted message, the highly sophisticated cipher used in . communications between Hitler and his generals during World War II. Margaret Mortimer, 87 was delighted to be reunited with members of the Women’s Royal Naval Service (Wrens). Most of them lost touch with each other after the war ended and they have not been together as a group for seven decades . Margaret O-Connell, 87, also featured in the photo which is believed to be one of only a handful in existence as photos were not meant to be taken at Bletchley Park during the war years . Lorna Cockayne, was also part of the group which were reunited after it was printed in a newspaper . Margaret Kelly, 87, from Monmouth, Wales, who joined the Wrens aged 18 . Joanna Chorley then and now. The reunion was organised after a rare picture of the Women’s Royal Naval Service was discovered in a drawer by Ms Chorley, 88, from Bucks . Betty Warwick, 89, worked at Bletchley Park as a registrar before going on to become a speech therapist after the war . Colossus was designed by British telephone engineer Tommy Flowers to speed up code-breaking of the complex Lorenz cipher. By the end of the war there were ten functioning Colossus machines and they had a decisive impact in shortening the war and saving countless lives. Colossus was the first electronic computer, but news of its existence was kept top secret for 30 years because of the sophistication and sensitivity surrounding the encryption it had helped to break. The computer was enormous, measuring 7ft high by 17ft wide and 11ft deep, weighing a tonne and using 8kW of power. It incorporated 2,500 valves, 501 of which are thyraton switches, about 100 logic gates and 10,000 resistors connected by 7 km of wiring. Back to reality: Of the 9,000 women who worked at Bletchley Park during World War II, just 600 went on to join the fledgling GCHQ or other branches of the secret services . Groundbreaking: But the work of female codebreakers wasn't always given the recognition it deserved at the time. Reading 5000 characters per second - faster than anything ever produced commercially ever since - it found the start wheel positions of Lorenz messages. It usually took Colossus up to three or four hours to establish the start wheel positions of messages, but it is often surmised that the Allies might have been reading some of the decrypted messages before they reached German High Command. By the end of the war, 63 million characters of high-grade German messages had been decrypted by the 550 people working on breaking Lorenz. In honour of the men and women who worked at Bletchley Park during the war, Tony Sale, co-founder of The National Museum of Computing, led a team to rebuild Colossus in 1994. On 15 November 2007, a rebuilt fully-functioning Colossus Mark II was unveiled to the public at The National Museum of Computing. The women were part of the Colossus C watch at Bletchley Park (pictured) in Buckinghamshire during the Second World War . The . intelligence war waging in a quiet corner of Buckinghamshire was to be . decisive in the Allied effort to win the Second World War. Station . X - known now as Bletchley Park - was the hub of Britain's code-backing . effort, where hugely talented mathematicians and inventors worked . tirelessly to give the armed forces a crucial helping-hand. Cambridge-educated mathematical genius Alan Turing . As . Winston Churchill himself made clear, the accurate information which . flowed from Bletchley Park every day, at a rate which sometimes reached . 6,000 messages a day, saved lives and gave Britain a crucial edge in . battle. Alan Turing, the . Cambridge-educated mathematical genius, and Post Office Engineer Tommy . Flowers, are the two most celebrated figures whose innovations greatly . improved the Allied ability to decipher German messages. The . Enigma machine, which was on sale commercially in the 1920s, was . modified by the Germans to make it more secure. They trusted completely . that its codes were unbreakable, and used it for all manner of important . communications. However, it was . thwarted in part thanks to Alan Turing's 'Bombe' device, which was able . to speed up the code-breaking process immeasurably. Turing . based his invention on a Polish device, the 'Bomba', which was handed . over to Britain just weeks before Poland was invaded in 1939. It . was not able to decipher German codes automatically, but once analysts . had manually deciphered a few letters by picking out common words, such . as the names of German generals or short words such as 'to' and 'they', . the device could rapidly test hundreds of other possibilities to put . together a code. Over . 100 of the machines were built to aid the code-breaking effort, but they . were all destroyed when the war ended. A replica was built in 2008, and . can be seen at Bletchley Park, which is now a museum. The . quest to beat the German intelligence services also resulted in the . construction of the world's first proper computer - called Colossus. Developed . by Tommy Flowers from a network of thousands of electronic valves, the . device was able to crack the Lorenz Cipher, which the Nazi high command . used for messages deemed too sensitive for Engima transmission. The . Colossus Mark II, which was five times faster than the original, was . finished less than a week before the Normandy landings, and gave the . Allies another crucial edge in the last phase of the war.","Six women worked on the Colossus machine at Bletchley Park during WW2 .

"By . Chris Greenwood . Migrant camp: A Romanian is moved on from Park Lane as police crackdown on UK gypsies . Police have travelled to Romania to discourage young men from coming to Britain and committing crime. In an unprecedented operation, Scotland Yard sent a ‘police mission’ of officers to rural northern Romania. The trip was designed to help stem the flow of low-skilled migrants who see London and similar cities as attractive destinations. Officers warned Romanians that if they arrive looking for jobs on the black market they are likely to be exploited or become victims of crime. But there is also evidence that many of those who come to Britain end up committing petty crimes such as begging and pickpocketing – sometimes recruited by organised gangs who ‘employ’ them to shoplift, steal and rob. The police operation came after a raid on the derelict ground of Hendon Football Club in North London. Officers discovered that almost every rough sleeper in the squat was from the same remote part of Romania. One man told BBC’s Panorama that up to 400 people had left his village in the Carpathian mountains for London. He said they were prepared to live in grim camps for the chance of illicit building work where they could earn up to three times their usual wages. Chief Superintendent Adrian Usher told the programme the message to Romanians was that they should not travel to Britain unless they can support themselves. ‘What I’m saying is that we know that if you come to the UK without a named job to go to, then you’re at really increased risk of being exploited or being the victim or perpetrator of crime,’ he said. ‘We’re here to protect all the residents of London and that includes those people who come to London looking for work.’ In an unprecedented mission, officers warned civilians of rural Romanian towns to be careful about migrating . Increasing: The number of Romanian immigrants, some pictured here in London's Marble Arch, is rising . Last week the Daily Mail revealed that Romanians are arrested at seven times the rate of Britons in London. And Romanian immigrants account for more than 11 per cent of all foreign national offenders – despite making up only a tiny proportion of UK residents. This placed the eastern European nation at the top of a ‘league table’ of foreign suspects, followed by those from Poland, Lithuania, India and Nigeria. The troubling figures were uncovered by police analysts just weeks before restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians living in Britain are lifted on January 1. Changes: Immigration Minister Mark Harper insists new rules will prevent people coming to sleep rough . They also discovered that eastern European offenders are more likely to be involved in low-level offences. Last year, Romanians accounted for nearly half of all arrests for begging in the capital and 34 per cent of pickpocketing arrests. Many live in makeshift camps across London, including Marble Arch and Park Lane, where efforts to move them have failed repeatedly. The Met has already brought a team of police from Romania and Poland to London to tackle crimes committed by their fellow nationals. There are concerns that gaps in cross-border intelligence checks are allowing prolific and dangerous offenders to slip through the net. Around 70,000 foreign nationals are arrested in London every year – about 28 per cent of all criminal suspects taken into custody. Immigration Minister Mark Harper said changes to legislation will allow border officials to stop people coming to Britain to sleep rough or beg. ‘We’ve removed some of those people before and one of the weaknesses at the moment is that they can come back and we can’t stop them,’ he said. Romanian Ambassador Ion Jinga said: ‘We are totally against any type of crime committed by Romanians. We have a zero tolerance on any type of crime.’ He added that Romania has ‘one of the lowest rates of crime in Europe’. Susan Hall, leader of Harrow council, said: 'The reality is nobody knows how many Romanians and Bulgarians are coming and that is deeply unsettling for councils. 'People who come here to work are welcome but January the first shouldn't be the starter's pistol for local authorities to be deluged with people they can't cope with. 'We are already seeing the effects of some criminality linked to Eastern Europeans seeping out to the suburbs - and that ranges from prostitution to pick pocketing and beds in sheds overcrowding. This has long since ceased to be just an inner city issue.'","Police warned people in northern rural towns they could be exploited .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . You may have created a battery using a potato or a lemon in a physics class at school. But one artist has taken the humble experiment a step further by using an array of fruit from limes to apples in order to make self-powered lights that light up his photographs. Caleb Charland uses nails hidden inside the fruit which are connected with copper to make batteries, inspired by the classic potato classroom experiment. Scroll down for video . A bright idea: An artist has taken the humble potato battery experiment a step further by using a vast array of fruit from limes to oranges (pictured) in order to make self-powered lights . The popular school experiment involves inserting two electrodes made of different metals into a potato or lemon to generate a small amount of electricity. Almost any liquid or moist object that has enough ions to be electrically conductive can serve as the electrolyte for a cell. The fruit/vegetable battery is a simple type of electrical battery that illustrates their main components. They are used in schools to illustrate the type of chemical reaction - oxidation-reduction - that occurs in batteries. A piece of zinc (such as a galvanised nail) and a piece of copper (wire or a penny) are used as electrodes, while the juice inside is the electrolyte. Several lemons or potatoes can be wired together to form a more powerful battery that will power a light, buzzer or digital clock. Fruit batteries are similar to the first electrical battery invented in 1800 by Alessandro Volta, who used brine (salt water) instead of lemon juice. The artist, from Bangor, Maine, transforms the fruit into electrochemical cells, which he arranges artistically before taking long-exposure photographs of his work in a bid to highlight the potential of sustainable energy. The fruit itself provides enough light to illuminate the photographs, which are all taken in the dark. He writes on his website: ‘To understand the world and to profit from it one must interact with it, one must experiment. ‘My practice as an artist combines a scientific curiosity with a constructive approach to making pictures. ‘I utilise everyday objects and fundamental forces to illustrate experiences of wonder. Mr Charland explained that his Back to Light project ‘expands upon a classic grade school science project, the potato battery. Juice to make juice: Caleb Charland uses nails hidden inside the fruit, such as limes (pictured) which are connected with copper to make batteries, inspired by the potato classroom experiment . Beacon of hope: The artist . transforms the fruit into electrochemical cells, which he arranges . artistically before taking long-exposure photographs of his work in a . bid to highlight the potential of sustainable energy. A quirky apple lampshade is pictured left and a citrus light, right . Illuminating: The fruit itself provides enough light to illuminate the photographs, which are all taken in the dark. At first glance, this arrangement looks a little like the solar system . ‘By . inserting a galvanised nail into one side of a potato and a copper wire . in the other side a small electrical current is generated. The utter . simplicity of this electrical phenomenon is endlessly fascinating for . me.’ He . believes that the fact that so many people have conducted the . experiment when they were young speaks to a common curiosity that humans . have in understanding how the world works ‘as well as a global concern . for the future of Earth’s energy sources. Mr Charland said: 'My practice as an artist combines a scientific curiosity with a constructive approach to making pictures.' Here, jars and bottles of liquid are used as batteries to produce light . Shining example: A  small electrical current is generated by inserting a galvanized nail into one side of the fruit and a copper wire in the other side. These apples have been connected to make a circuit capable of powering a small light (pictured) ‘My hope is that these photographs function as micro utopias by suggesting and illustrating the endless possibilities of alternative and sustainable energy production,’ he said. ‘The cycle that begins with the light of our closest star implanting organic materials with nutrients and energy, is re-routed in these images, Back to Light, illuminating Earth once again.’ Tree of knowledge: Mr Charland explained that his Back to Light project 'expands upon a classic grade school science project, the potato battery'. Here, the principles of the experiment - and plenty of apples -are used to illuminate the tree with a make-shift chandelier . 'My hope is that these photographs function as micro utopias by suggesting and illustrating the endless possibilities of alternative and sustainable energy production,' he said .","An artist in Bangor, Maine was inspired to create the fruit-powered lights by the popular potato battery classroom experiment .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Ships, oil rigs and offshore wind farms are at risk from rough seas. But radar instruments on satellites are being used to forecast extreme wave heights that could endanger people and the environment. The satellites measure wind speed by monitoring at the surface of the sea from multiple angles as they fly over, calculating how rough the waters are and in turn the height of waves. Scroll down for video . Radar instruments on-board satellites are . being used to forecast extreme wave heights (pictured) that could endanger people . and the environment . Radar instruments on-board satellites look at the surface of the sea they are flying over. They measure the reflectivity of the water, which is determined by the roughness of the surface. Higher reflectivity is caused by strong winds, which create higher waves, whereas lower reflectivity indicates a gentle breeze and calm waters. Wind speed can be calculated by measuring the reflectivity of the sea. Using a computer model, experts can then work out the wind direction and the height of waves. This data is then translated into hypnotic animations that reveal the precise movement of the seas. A recently released video produced by the European Space Agency (Esa) shows such a map of the North Sea, which also plots oil rigs, wind farms and large ships. The animated model takes into account the wind’s speed and direction in order to predict the height of the waves that could batter the infrastructure. Radar satellites such as Sentinel 1 improve the calculations of wind fields and wave height by measuring the reflectivity of the water, determined by the roughness of the surface and therefore the wind speed. Radar satellites such as Sentinel 1(pictured) improve the calculations of wind fields and wave height by measuring the reflectivity of the water, determined by the roughness of the surface and therefore the wind speed . In the animation, pale blue denotes calm . waters, while bright purple indicates waves of up to 49ft (15metres) high and it is possible to see how areas of rough sea ripple in . different directions . A video produced by the European Space Agency (Esa) shows a map (pictured) of the North Sea, which marks on oil rigs, wind farms and large ships . The height of waves largely depends on the speed of the wind whipping across the surface of the water. Higher reflectivity of the water caused by strong wind creates higher waves and wind direction can be calculated by experts studying satellite images to pinpoint ‘streaks’ on the water’s surface, Wired reported. In the animation, pale blue denotes calm waters, while bright purple indicates waves of up to 49ft (15metres) high and it is possible to see how areas of rough sea ripple in different directions. All this data can be used to warn captains of ships and workers aboard offshore infrastructure of dangerous conditions. In the past, towering waves have destroyed expensive offshore wind farms and wrecked ships, while there is a chance of wreaking environmental havoc if an oil rig is badly damaged. The height of waves largely depends on the speed of the wind whipping across the surface of the water. Here, a ship called the Harvester powers through huge waves in the North Sea .","Radar instruments on-board satellites are being used to forecast extreme wave heights that could endanger people and infrastructure .

"By . Paul Donnelley . A Cardiff hero whose name appears on a monument to the fallen of the First World War actually survived the conflict. Alf Norman fought in the Boer War, the Great War and worked in a munitions factory during the Second World War yet he is on the Grangetown Memorial remembering the war dead. Sergeant Norman went on to live for three decades after the memorial recording his death was built. The great survivor: Alf Norman's (left) name appears on the Grangetown War Memorial (right) for the First World War fallen even though he survived the conflict . He was serving with the Glamorgan Yeomanry, believed to be in Mesopotamia, when his wife received two telegrams - one to say he was missing presumed killed and another to say he had been killed in action. His Cork-born ‘widow’ Mary organised a traditional Irish wake in his absence. Later news came through that far from being dead her husband was still very much alive and doing his bit for king and country. And family legend has it that Mary quipped: ‘I've never been able to rely on him for anything.’ For some reason, his name was still put forward in the early 1920s when the Cardiff memorial was built. For the fallen: The war memorial in Grange Gardens, Cardiff, where the name of Alf Norman appears as one of the First World War remembered even though he was still alive for 32 years after the Great War ended . Before he died in 1950 he was known for taking special trips with family visitors to the Grangetown Memorial to show how his name had been wrongly recorded as one of the area's 330 war dead. Zena Mabbs, the chairman of Grangetown Local History Society, said that it is one of several mistakes her group has found on the memorial. ‘I would imagine that in those days people had to fill in a form about their family member,’ she said. ‘As you can appreciate, in 1914 a lot of people were quite illiterate. For example, one of the men that died is named as 'W.C Ridland', but we've discovered his name was actually 'Cridland', which is a very well known family in Grangetown. ‘The name of another man Private George Harben is on twice.’ Father-of-five Sgt Norman, born in Somerset in 1869, had run away from home to join the army at 15. As well as his Boer and Great War service he also served in Britain's colonies of India and Ireland. He escaped the Blitz when a German bomb hit his home in Maitland Place, Grangetown, on January 2, 1941. It was the worst night of the Blitz for the Welsh capital. Alf Norman's name appears on the Grangetown Memorial memorialising the war dead even though he lived until 1950 . Up to 165 people were killed and 427 more injured, while nearly 350 homes were destroyed or had to be demolished. Chapels and the nave of Llandaff Cathedral were also damaged. Grangetown was the first area to be hit by 100 German aircraft during the 10-hour air raid. Mr Norman, who worked as a postman and an inspector in Cardiff's arcades in civilian life, had taken refuge in an air-raid shelter when the sirens sounded and family legend has it that he calmly surveyed the burnt out remains of his home while puffing on a cigar he had been given for Christmas. To mark the centenary of the First World War the local history society has been collecting the personal histories of the men whose names appear on the Grangetown Memorial to produce online tributes. Their research has unearthed 90 soldiers killed in the conflict whose names are missing from the memorial.","Alf Norman fought in the Boer War, the First World War and worked in a munitions factory during the Blitz .

Welcome to The Dating Game, people. Way too often, girls fall for . players who they know are going to screw them over, or they throw . themselves at guys and wonder why they've never heard from them again, . or they stay in dead-­end relationships because they are too scared of . being alone. These girls aren't strangers, they're me, they're my . friends, they're all of us. But it's not our fault. Dating nowadays is . seriously complicated and the more attached we get to someone the more . confusing it seems to become. That's why I decided to write this book. It's taken a lot of long and painful lessons for me to work out how to . play the dating game and I've often wished someone could have just told . me the rules from the start, before I had to learn them the hard way. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that I've mastered them all or that . I've got a perfect track record. In fact, as you will find out in this . book, my experience of cheats, double betrayals and public scandals . makes my record far from ideal! But the dating mistakes I've made and . the experiences I've had to go through have taught me that I won't put . up with anybody who doesn't treat me the way I deserve, ever again. I am . never going to settle for just any guy that comes along… it's got to be . the right guy. And, hopefully after reading my book, neither will you. It's about time that we learned how to play men at their own game. In . The Dating Game, I've hopefully covered all the bases, from being . single, to going on first dates and figuring out if he's that . interested, to making a relationship work and even how to get over an . ex. I want to make sure that if we play the dating game properly none of . us will be played ever again.","MIC star, 23, unveiled as new face of Wilkinson Sword razor .

"By . Alex Greig . Newly declassified documents reveal new information about the CIA's Project Azorian, a plan hatched to secretly salvage a Soviet nuclear submarine. In 1974, the CIA commissioned Howard Hughes to construct a massive vessel to recover a Soviet submarine that sank in the Pacific Ocean in 1968. Some 200 pages on Project Azorian, one of the most complex, expensive, and secretive intelligence operations of the Cold War, reveal previously unknown details of the aborted plan. Covert operation: American millionaire businessman, film director, and aviator, Howard Hughes was contracted by the CIA to build a huge vessel to secretly recover a Soviet submarine . According to io9.com, the submarine was important to the U.S. because it would enable officials to examine the design of Soviet nuclear warheads and decipher Soviet naval codes. The Soviets tried for two months to recover the sub, but the attempts were fruitless. Hughes's vessel, the Hughes Glomar Explorer, embarked on a salvage mission in 1974 which was somewhat successful. A planned follow-up mission in 1975 was aborted after the top-secret plan was leaked to the press. Afterwards, the CIA refused to comment on Project Azorian, neither confirming nor denying involvement with Hughes's vessel. In the recently published Foreign Relations of the United States volume, National Security Policy: 1973-1976, new details emerge of the plan to covertly steal the sub. According to the documents, a team of engineers designed the 618-foot, 36,000-ton recovery vessel and commissioned Howard Hughes's company the Summa Corporation to build it. In order to thwart any suspicions that could be raised by the sight of the gigantic recovery vessel, the CIA invented a story that the Hughes Glomar Explorer (HGE) was being built for a private business venture of Hughes's - mining manganese nodules from the ocean floor. The determination reached was that deep ocean mining would be particularly suitable... Mr. Howard Hughes... is recognized as a pioneering entrepreneur with a wide variety of business interests; he has the necessary financial resources; he habitually operates in secrecy; and, his personal eccentricities are such that news media reporting and speculation about his activities frequently range from the truth to utter fiction,' reads a memo from Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in 1974. Colossal ship: The Glomar Explorer, now used for deep sea exploration, shown tied up in Long Beach harbor . As the $800 million project continued, officials began to raise questions about whether retrieving the submarine was worth the resources being plowed into it, six years after it sank. Ultimately, a committee decide that the benefits to be gained from examining the submarine were worth the expense. In addition, the director of the CIA was concerned that canceling the project now would make the government seem 'capricious' to contractors. Another memo stated that 'provisions for handling and disposition of the target crew remains are generally in accordance with the 1949 Geneva Convention. They will be handled with due respect and returned to the ocean bottom.' In addition, any personal effects belonging to the dead crew members from the Soviet submarine would be kept to eventually returned to their families as a way to placate the Soviets if they discovered the theft of the vessel. 'Culminating six years of effort, the AZORIAN Project is ready to attempt to recover a Soviet ballistic missile submarine from 16,500 feet of water in the Pacific. 'The recovery ship would depart the west coast 15 June and arrive at the target site 29 June. Recovery operations will take 21–42 days (30 June to 20 July–10 August),' reads a memo from Kissinger. The project was given a 40 per cent change of success - apparently an optimistic estimate for ventures of the risk and difficulty that Project Azorian posed. Secrets of the deep: An aerial starboard bow view of a Soviet Golf II class ballistic missile submarine like the one that sank in the Pacific Ocean . The first salvage mission in 1974 was only partially successful after a portion of the submarine fell back into the water as it was being hauled up by the capture vessel. During this time, President Nixon had resigned and officials were unsure whether the project could remain secret for much longer. Kissinger spoke about his concerns to President Gerald Ford. 'There are so many people who have to be briefed on covert operations, it is bound to leak. There is no one with guts left. All of yesterday they were making a record to protect themselves about AZORIAN. It was a discouraging meeting. I wonder if we shouldn't get the leadership in and discuss it. Maybe there should be a Joint Committee,' he said. 'I have always fought that, but maybe we have to. It would have to be a tight group, not a big broad one,' Ford responded. 'I am really worried. We are paralyzed,' said Kissinger. In fact, the press was already onto the story, with a New York Times journalist Seymour Hersh, twice being asked by the CIA to delay publication of the story. In the end, it wasn't the Times that broke the story, it was a gaffe by the CIA itself. In 1974, Summa Corporation was broken into, and thieves stole four boxes of documents - and a memo about Project Azorian's true progenitors was missing. Soon after, LA police were contacted by a person claiming to be acting on behalf of a person in possession of the documents who wanted $500,00 for their safe return. Contractor: The CIA didn't want to put contractors like Howard Hughes offside by cancelling Project Azorian . Trying to deduce whether the thief did indeed have the missing memo, the CIA informed the FBI about it. The FBI passed on the information to police, who asked the intermediary whether the thief was in possession of it. Shortly before the second planned salvage mission, the Los Angeles Times published a report stating that 'reports circulating among local law enforcement officers' indicated Howard 'was contracted to the CIA to raise a sunken Russian nuclear submarine from the Atlantic Ocean… The operation, one investigator theorized, was carried out - or at least attempted - by the crew of a marine mining vessel owned by Hughes Summa Corp.' After that, it was a free for all and Hersh published his story - as did several other major newspapers, with the Washington Post and the New York Times making it their front page. Contrary to fears of retaliation, the Soviets did not publicly respond to the reports, hoping to play down its own failure to retrieve the submarine. The CIA was unwilling to push the Soviets any further though, believing that 'It seems beyond doubt that the Soviets would go to great lengths to frustrate or disrupt a second mission.' Eventually, Kissinger told Ford that the Soviets were stationed at the site of the submarine and would not allow a second salvage mission without a fight. The total cost of the ultimately failed mission was $800 million - which, reports io9.com, translates to about $3 billion. The Hughes Glomar Explorer was eventually repurposed to be a deep-sea driller, as per the CIA's original fictitious story and last sold to a private company for $15 million in 2010.","Recently declassified documents shed light on the CIA's secretive Project Azorian .

"By . Michael Zennie . The father of a seven-year-old boy killed in the Newtown school shooting has a message for Richard Martinez: You're not alone. Mark Barden has written a heart-wrenching open letter to the man whose son was gunned down by Elliot Rodger in Santa Barbara last weekend - offering his condolences and his support. 'We have not met, but you are now part of our extended family,' Barden writes in a Facebook message. 'It is not a family we chose, but a family born from the horrible circumstance of losing a child to gun violence - one that’s only growing each day.' Scroll down for video . Richard Martinez, whose son Christopher was gunned down by Elliot Rodger, has become an outspoken proponent of tougher gun laws . Mark Barden lost his son Daniel in the Newtown school shootings. He reached out to Richard Martinez to offer his support . Mr Martinez's son 20-year-old Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez, a student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, was killed Friday as he walked into a convenience store - one of three students shot dead by Rodger. The son of an assistant Hunger Games Director stabbed his three roommates to death and also killed himself in a rampage that left seven dead and 13 injured. Mr Martinez has been a furiously outspoken since the day after his son's murder. In one speech he blamed the seven deaths on 'craven, irresponsible politicians and the NRA.' On Tuesday, he brought 20,000 mourning college students to their feet with his chant 'Not One More' at a memorial service for the victims of Rodger's rampage. Mark Barden offered these words of sympathy for Richard Martinez after his very public expression of grief and anger over his son's murder . Chris Michael-Martinez, 20, was gunned down at a convenience store. He was planning to go to London this summer and had been aspiring to law school . Elliott Rodger legally purchased all three of the handguns he used on his rampage, according to police . Mark and his wife Jackie have been similarly outspoken since their son Daniel was gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012. They have appeared alongside President Barack Obama as he pushed for increasing gun control and background check restrictions. They have also granted numerous media interviews - perhaps more than any other Newtown family - to talk about their son's legacy and to advocate for laws that they say could help prevent future mass shootings. Police have said that Rodger was carrying three semi-automatic handguns that he purchased legally from a local gun shop.","Mark Barden wrote an open letter to Richard Martinez, who has become to face of the the Santa Barbara massacre .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Revolting plot: Rose Mary Vogel, 55, of Sun Lakes, . Arizona, has been charged with first-degree attempted murder for . allegedly injecting fecal matter into her hospitalized husband's IV line . Police in Arizona have released the 911 call that led to the arrest of a 55-year-old woman suspected of trying to kill her hospitalized ex-cop husband by injecting feces matter into his IV line. The call came last Friday afternoon from the Chandler Regional Medical Center's head of security. Hospital staff said they found Rose Mary Vogel tampering with the IV line and saw a brown substance blocking the tube attached to the body of the woman’s husband, 66-year-old Philip Vogel, a retired police officer from Lexington, Kentucky. When it was searched in the hospital, Vogel's purse contained a total of three syringes, including two with a clear liquid, police said. Police documents said Vogel is a retired registered nurse who formerly worked at the Chandler hospital. On the 911 call released Monday, the hospital security chief sounds almost embarrassed describing the incident. ‘We have a situation here where… how do I explain this…’ he begins to explain, MyFox Phoenix reported. The security supervisor goes on to say that staff didn't see Vogel inject the fecal matter into the IV line, but she was the only person in the room when the tampering occurred. ‘She was in the room, and she's a former nurse and she was playing with the IV pump and everything else,’ the unidentified man says. Victim: Vogel's husband has been identified as 66-year-old Philip Vogel, a 22-year veteran of the Lexington Police Department who retired in 1995 after shooting dead a young black suspect . He then adds: ‘It's a substance that you can't get unless you inject it into there. Somebody has done that.’ Police said a hospital laboratory test identified the substance as fecal matter, and a trace amount of a brown substance also was found in the needle of an otherwise empty syringe found in Vogel's purse. Veteran cop: Then-Lexington Police Sgt. Phil Vogel is pictured in October 1994 responding to a jail disturbance . Vogel, of Sun Lakes, is being held on suspicion of attempted first-degree murder and vulnerable adult abuse. Police don't have a possible motive yet. Vogel declined to be interviewed by police and asked for an attorney after her arrest. The incident occurred after Mr Vogel had undergone a heart procedure. Police said Monday that he remains hospitalized, but his condition wasn't immediately released. Philip Vogel had served on the police force in Lexington for 22 years until 1995, when he retired after the controversial shooting of a young black man, Lexington Herald Leader reported. In October 1994, then-Sgt Vogel and other officers were trying to arrest 18-year-old Tony Sullivan on felony warrants when the veteran cop shot the suspect in the head. Vogel later explained that his service weapon discharged accidentally. A grand jury decided not to indict him. After . leaving the police department, Vogel got a master's degree in criminal . justice education and moved to sun Lakes, Arizona, with his wife, Rose . Mary. The couple have been married for more than 30 years, and their stunned neighbors in Sun Lakes say the two seemed very happy. Caught in the act: Nurses at Chandler Regional Medical Center, where Vogel used to work, found the woman manipulating her husband's IV . ‘This . was not your typical Rose Mary. It was like another person or a demon . got a hold of her or she snapped,’ neighbor Mary Lola Reese told the . station KCTV5. Philip Vogel is expected to survive the procedure on his heart, as well as the alleged attempt on his life. According to a police report, Mrs Vogel was sitting with her husband in a Chandler Regional Medical Center recovery room at around 1.30pm Thursday following a surgery on his heart. A pair of nurses walked into the room and noticed the wife in the act of handling her husband's IV line, which caused an alarm to go off. Herself a registered nurse, Rose Mary Vogel told her former colleagues that the IV line needed to be flushed. That is when another hospital staffer discovered a brown substance in the medical equipment and removed the line from the patient’s arm, noting that the IV smelled like feces, the station WFSB reported. Contaminated: A hospital staffer observed that the 66-year-old patient's IV line contained a brown substance and smelled of feces . The nurse went for help, and upon her return she found the 65-yar-old wife trying to empty the contaminated IV bag into the trash, only to have one of the hospital personnel snatch it out of her hands, according to the report. The suspect initially had faced a charge of aggravated assault, which was later upgraded to first-degree attempted murder. Rose Mary Vogel is being held on $100,000 bond in the Maricopa county Jail.","Rose Mary Vogel charged with first-degree attempted murder for allegedly trying to kill her 66-year-old husband .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . It is the phenomenon that has changed our lives, seeing us pause to snap photos of ourselves at any 'reasonable' moment – while eating, meeting friends or even lying in bed. But now, it seems, the selfie is taking over the places where we stay on holiday. Scroll down for video . Say cheese: The Selfie is increasingly taking over the world of travel . Hotels – from the beaches of the Caribbean to the distant shores of Australia – are adding their weight to the selfie craze, encouraging guests (or would-be guests) to turn their cameras on themselves in order to make the most of their stays – and to win prizes. For example, the La Concha Resort in Puerto Rico is currently promoting its ‘Take A Selfie Adventure Package’. Available between May and August, the deal costs from $179 per night (£106), and includes discounts on visits to sites like the Bacardi rum distillery. Guests are encouraged to reel off a string of selfies at locations such as the island’s 16th century Fort San Felipe del Morro – in the hope that they will ‘tag in’ the hotel using its Twitter handle, or talk about it on other social media sites. Embrace the craze: The 1888 Hotel in Sydney has a 'Selfie Space' set aside for guests to snap themselves . In return, they can win further nights of accommodation. The hotel will select one of the submitted selfies for each of the four months of the promotion, with each winning ‘photographer’ earning another three-night stay. The hotel has even posted instructions to get guests in the selfie-snapping mood. ‘Be creative when taking your selfie,’ it advises. ‘Tag your post with ‘La Concha Resort’ on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter (@laconcharesort).’ It is not alone in embracing this modern trend.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . In the early hours of 17th July 1918, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia was marched into a cellar of a house in Yekaterinburg and mown down by a firing squad. Along with the Tsar, those who were thought to have died that morning included the Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna, his son, Alexei Nikolaevich and his four daughters, Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia. But now a respected Russian historian has now claimed that Anastasia Nikoleavna might not, as previously thought, have perished at all. Murdered: The Romanov Grand Duchesses (from left) Olga, Tatiana, Marie and Anastasia . Instead, Veniamin Alekseyev believes that the Grand Duchess Anastasia did indeed flee to the West and says he has new evidence to prove it. Since her death, women posing as the Russian princess have repeatedly come forward, among them Anna Anderson who first appeared in Berlin in 1920, two years after the Russian royals were executed. Anderson, who also went by the names Tschaikovsky and Manahan, later moved to the USA and was portrayed for decades as the escaped daughter of the last Romanov emperor. But in 1991, when the remains of the Russian royals were unearthed, DNA testing proved that the bodies were indeed those of the Tsar, Tsarina and their children. Family: Tsar Nicholas with his family, including Anastasia (far right) and son Alexei Nikolaevich . Devoted: Tsar Nicholas was devoted to his wife Alix and died in her arms on that fateful morning in 1918 . Testing also 'conclusively' proved that Anderson was not, as she claimed, the Grand Duchess Anastasia, and instead a mentally troubled Polish factory worker named Franziska Schanzkowska. Alekseyev, however, is unconvinced and claims that Anderson really was the lost princess in an explosive new book. 'On the basis of the archive documents discovered, and new Russian and foreign evidence I have seen since 1991, I have reason to think the royal family's fate is not as certain as it has been believed for almost 100 years,' he said. The new documents from the Russian State Archive and elsewhere offer evidence from Imperial family confidantes and relatives, as well as doctors who treated Anderson, who believed it was 'quite possible and even probable' that she was Russian princess Anastasia. His book entitled Who are you, Ms Tchaikovskaya? argues she was 'labelled an imposter too easily', The Siberian Times revealed. Happy family: Grand Duchess Anastasia with her father, Tsar Nicholas II, the last of the Romanov emperors . Final months: The Romanovs pictured during their exile in Tobolsk which lasted until April 1918 . Doomed: The Russian royals during their final months before being shot by revolutionaries in July 1918 . Imposter: Anna Anderson claimed to be Anastasia although her claims are much disputed . Although DNA tests were carried out on bones purporting to be those of Anastasia and on a lock of Anderson's hair after her death, Alekseyev argues the genetic analysis is not conclusive. The book builds on the theory of eminent French historian Marc Ferro that the German-born empress Alexandra along with the imperial couple's four daughters were saved. 'I do not assume presumptuously she was executed by the Bolsheviks,' said Alekseyev who served on a Russian government commission which concluded bones found near Yekaterinburg were the remains of Nicholas II. 'This is for the reader to decide.' He claims testimony from Bolsheviks and White Russians which states the entire family were killed in July 1918 is not trustworthy. 'The former needed an image of an uncompromising new government determined to wipe out the old world without a trace, and the latter - a Great Russia without an emperor,' said Alekseyev. He expect still-secret papers documenting diplomatic negotiations between Germany and the Soviets, due for release in 2018, to throw new light on a possible secret exchange close to the end of the First World War. 'Why such mercy on the part of the Bolsheviks? After the leftist Social-Revolutionaries assassinated German Ambassador Mirbach, Wilhelm II could breach the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which would have ruined the Soviet regime. Therefore, they had to negotiate,' said Alekseyev. Discovery: The Romanovs were discovered in 1991 and laid to rest at the Petropavlovskaya fortress . Childhood: Tsar Nicholas II and George V met during family holidays in Denmark and remained close friends . Firm friends: Tsar Nicholas II and King George V were cousins and close friends thanks to their mothers . He added: 'All over the world this issue has been degraded for decades by unpretentious stage productions, garbage literature and films. 'We need scientific clarity over this complicated issue. Therefore, I am only publishing the documents. Where the truth lies, is up to the readers to decide.' Officially, Russia believes it has found the genuine but incomplete bones of the royals, despite reservations by the Orthodox Church. The Romanovs, who are buried in the former royal capital of St Petersburg, still have living relations - among them Prince Phillip, whose maternal grandmother was Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, the older sister of the doomed Tsarina. After Tsar Nicholas abdicated on 15th March 1917, he and his family were moved from house to house as the revolution and ensuing civil war raged around them. By May 1918, they had been installed at the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg which was under Bolshevik control. The house was owned by Yakov Yurovsky, a dedicated Marxist and Bolshevik with close links to the Cheka - the secret police force run by the revolutionaries. At around 2.15am on the morning of the 17th July 1918, Yurovsky and a squad of Bolsheviks burst into the bedrooms of the Russian royals and ordered them into the cellar. Minutes later, the soldiers, each armed with a revolver and led by Yurovsky, followed them into the room. According to Yurovsky, he ordered them to stand. Characteristically, the Tsarina did so 'with a flash of anger'. 'Your relations have tried to save you,' he is believed to have said next. 'They have failed and we must now shoot you.' The Tsar rose from his chair and only had time to utter 'What...?' before he was shot several times in the chest. The Tsarina died next, killed by a single bullet fired by commissar Peter Ermakov that entered her head just above the left ear, followed by her haemophilliac son Alexei, who was just 13-years-old when he died. The last to perish were Anastasia and her sisters, saved, initially by the valuable diamonds hidden in their bodices. The girls were then bayoneted by the Bolshevik fighters before being finished off with a shot to the head.","Veniamin Alekseyev says Grand Duchess Anastasia probably did escape .

"By . Candace Sutton . In April 1977, a young woman set off from the centre of Australia to cross 2700km of desert and bush with four camels and a dog . It was the epic journey of a beautiful young Australian through the outback, the whirlwind romance she had amid the dunes and the mystery of why she made the trek. It is Robyn Davidson's real life story and now, finally, almost 37 years later, it is about to premiere on the screen in a new movie, Tracks, starring Mia Wasikowska as the young Davidson. Almost 37 years after Robyn Davidson (right) made history crossing the Australian desert her epic 2700 km journey has been recreated in a film, Tracks, starring actress Mia Wasikowska (left) playing her younger self . May 1, 1978: Robyn Davidson, then aged 27, with her camels on the beach in Western Australia, with the Indian Ocean behind them in the late afternoon on a perfect day when the camels got their first glimpse at the large expanse of water . After braving the harshness and dangers of the desert, Robyn Davidson had the exhilarating moment of reaching the Indian Ocean off Western Australia, recreated here by Mia Wasikowska in the new film Tracks . Davidson's 2700km crossing of Australia, from the Northern Territory town of Alice Springs to the Indian Ocean off Western Australia became a legend among desert Aboriginal tribes and a puzzle to many Australians to this day. The journey shaped Davdison's life, the enigmatic blonde becoming a writer with a passion for studying nomadic people who had relationships with famous, enigmatic men, including Salman Rushdie. Her trip made headlines around the world, and Davidson's subsequent book, Tracks, became an international bestseller, which filmmakers have been trying to bring to the screen for decades. Now as the 63-year-old, who divides her time between Australia, London and India, is preparing for cinema audiences around the world to see what her young self encountered on her odyssey of self discovery. SCROLL DOWN FOR TRAILER... Film maker Mandy Walker behind the camera in the desert recreating the odyssey of Robyn Davidson more than three decades after she crossed Australia as a young woman . Playing New Yorker and National Geographic photographer Rick Smolan, played here by Adam Driver (above) as he records Robyn Davidson's increible journey for National Geographic . Reunited in the desert after 37 years, the real Rick Smolan and Robyn Davidson (above, left) on the set of Tracks which charts her journey with camels, portrayed (above, right) by Mia Wasikowska . The desert romance of Robyn Davidson and photographer Rick Smolan (above, played by Wasikowska and Driver) is a centrepiece of the film Tracks . Davidson has never explained precisely why, at the age of 25, she took off for Alice Springs to train for two years in how to handle camels and to survive the harshness of the desert. She then embarked on her journey with camels Dookie, Bub, Zeleika and Goliath, and dog, Diggity. The film shows Wasikowska as Davidson, in dusty and ragged clothes, her beautiful dirt-smeared face against the haunting light and breathtaking backdrop of the wilds of the Australian desert. Her only companions were members of local Aboriginal tribes and a charismatic young New Yorker and National Geographic photographer, Rick Smolan (played in the film by Adam Driver), who captured parts of the trip and with whom she had an affair. Davidson's encounters with Aboriginals during her 2700km trek makes for some memorable scenes in the film (above) Mia Wasikowska (above) had to learn to work with the camels used in the film, set in the desert of central and Western Australia . The key to the young Davidson's desire to escape from civilisation on her life-changing expedition may lie in her childhood. When she was an 11-year-old schoolgirl living on a cattle property in outback Queensland, Davidson's mother committed suicide, after which she was brought up by her father's unmarried sister. Davidson told the Sydney Morning Herald to equate her trek with the suicide was 'grossly simplified' but that that her mother was 'a powerful absence'. Rick Smolan, who remains lifelong friends with Davidson, describes her as a 'dreamer'. Following the success of Tracks, Davidson wrote further books about her travels, From Alice to the Ocean and Desert Places. She had a relationship with Salman Rushdie, after the author came to Australia, read Tracks, fell in love with Davidson's writing, and then with Davidson. ""Robyn' (Mia Wasinkowska) and the real Robyn sit in the doorway of the actress's trailer on the set of Tracks, and against the stunning backdrop of the outback where Davidson advised and reassure the actress in her role . Later, she lived in the foothills of the Himalayas with an Indian man she met after she attended the annual Pushkar Camel Fair. About her book finally coming to the screen, Davidson said she had resisted earlier offers because she wanted it to be an Australian, not a Hollywood film. 'I was such a purist I just didn’t want Hollywood to have it. I thought . . . It should have its own values that are close to what the journey itself meant, and what the book meant.' Finally she agreed to a production with Oscar-winning producer of The King’s Speech, Emile Sherman and Davidson was both consulted for the film and travelled with cast and crew on location in the Australian desert. Tracks has been screened at the Venice Film Festival, and was the official selection for the Toronto International Film Festival and Telluride Film Festival.","Real life story of Australian girl's epic desert journey comes to screen .

"By . Chris Pleasance . and Ian Drury . Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher refused the Pope's compromise, saying that there were worse things than war, including 'the extinction of all that one believed in' Pope John Paul II tried to persuade Margaret Thatcher to stop fighting Argentina over the Falkland Islands, newly uncovered documents have revealed. The Vatican urged the Prime Minister to reach an ‘honourable compromise’ with the military junta in Buenos Aires over the future of the remote group of islands in the South Atlantic. But Mrs Thatcher defiantly rejected the peace plea, insisting there could be ‘no compromise between right and wrong’. The Pope asked Mrs Thatcher to 'compromise' with the Argentine government, fearing that defeat for Argentina would topple its right-wing government, allowing the Soviets to seize more power in the region. But a top-secret memo, released after 23 years, shows how the Iron Lady resisted, saying that the Argentines should 'go home and leave the Queen's people'. According to the Sunday Express Mrs Thatcher confessed that the war was a 'terrible evil' but not as terrible as 'the extinction of all that one believed in.' The Pope made the plea through Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, one of his most senior diplomats, who visited the UK ahead of the pontiff's arrival on May 28 1982. The 50-minute meeting took place in secret with no Cabinet ministers present at around 6.40pm. According to the memo, written by Thatcher's private personal secretary Sir Clive Whitmore to Sir Brian Fell, principal private secretary to the foreign secretary, the meeting was almost entirely devoted to the Falklands. Mr Whitmore wrote that the Pope had concerns over 'dangerous consequences' of a 'general' kind. The Holy See worried that toppling the Argentine government would allow the Soviets the opportunity to drive a wedge between the West and Latin America. The plea came just hours after British troops capture Goose Green, marking the first land battle of the war . Instead, John Paul II suggests that an 'honourable' compromise might suit all parties better. Just hours before the visit took place, around 500 British paratroopers from British Falklands Task Force recaptured Goose Green from 1,200 Argentinian soldiers, marking the first land battle of the war. While the victory was a resounding success for the military, it came at a cost of 17 British lives.","In May 1982, during Falklands War, Pope John Paul II visited Britain .

"By . Harish V Nair . Vineeta Aron, a resident of Andrews Ganj near South Extension market, is still recovering from a leg fracture she sustained in a recent scooter accident. Aron's was no ordinary accident. It was around 8 am, and the traffic was still light when the 32-year-old was chased and attacked by a pack of stray dogs. Prince and the stray dog: Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, and Founder and Executive Director of Katha, Geeta Dharmarajan looking at a stray dog as they leave after a visit to the Katha Lab school in New Delhi . Almost . 25 residents . get bitten . by the canines . in Delhi . every day . As the snarling dogs closed in, Aron panicked and crashed her two-wheeler into a tree. She was fortunate that the pack dispersed, or dog-bite treatment would have been added to a broken leg. Across the Yamuna, 59-year-old businessman Babu Menon has stopped going for a morning walk in Patparganj's neat grid of apartment complexes. He fears the stray dogs that seem to skulk in every shadow. ""Many joggers have already got bitten and I am scared,"" he says. Aron and Menon are but two of thousands of Delhi residents living in mortal fear of man's best friends of the stray kind. The city has already reported 8,783 cases of dog bites this year, an increase of nearly 30 per cent over last year. That's almost 25 Delhi residents being bitten by a dog-or dogs-every day of the year, or one every hour. The North Corporation area was the worst-bitten with 4,388 cases while South and East Corporation reported 2,695 and 1,700 cases. A survey conducted just before the . trifurcation of the civic body reported 3.6 lakh stray dogs in Delhi. The number has gone up to over 4 lakh since then. Their sex ratio is 51:49 (1,84,000 male and 1,28,000 female dogs). Steps at birth control have been a spectacular failure as only less than half of the animals could be sterilised. A . recent survey commissioned by civic corporations says at least 70 per . cent of the canines must be sterilised for any significant effect on the . Capital's canine population. The . Delhi High Court last week asked the Animal Welfare Board to oversee . the effort for controlling the stray dog population, and ensure ready . availability of antirabies vaccination in hospitals. The court was acting on a PIL filed by lawyer SK Singh that sought the court's intervention into the city's dog bite problem. The trigger for the PIL was 25 people falling victim to dog bites within a span of a month recently inside the AIIMS campus. Two resident doctors and a senior doctor's wife were among the victims. A survey report filed by East Delhi . Municipal Corporation in the Delhi High Court touches on the key reason . for anti-stray dog drive ending in a whimper. The . three corporations, NDMC and Delhi Cantonment Board are mainly banking . on several animal rights NGOs to carry out sterilisation drive as they . do not have the necessary resources. ""While all the NGOs are willing to intensify the work to achieve the 70 per cent target, there are many shortcomings. NGOs lack infrastructure, payments to them are delayed and they are entrusted too many areas,"" the report says. ""MCD . has created the entire problem.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A young woman has filmed herself speaking gibberish in a string of different accents to show how people speaking foreign languages sound - at least to her. Nineteen-year-old Sara from Finland uses her remarkable skill for mimicry to show what different languages sound to foreigners who don't understand them. Her caricatures are so good that, to anyone who doesn't know the languages she is imitating, she could almost be a fluent speaker. Mockney: Sara, a 19-year-old Finn, with a remarkable skill for mimicry . Body language: Sara adopts the distinctive grin of a California girl as she mimics the U.S. accent . Her British accent is pure London youth, complete with a sprinkling of 'innits' and glottal stops in the place of her 'tee' consonants, while her American accent is reminiscent of California. Like all the best mimics, she even replicates the body language of the cultures whose language she's imitating. Sara, who doesn't give her surname, says that her video is just her 'goofing' around and cautions viewers not to take it too seriously. Nevertheless some people appear to have taken offence. 'I don't even know': Nineteen-year-old Sara, who doesn't give her surname, says that her video is just her 'goofing' around and cautions viewers not to take it too seriously . In her defence, she writes: 'I know some of them suck, but that's kinda the point cus I don't understand two sh**s of that particular language and thats why it sounds like jibberish to me.

"By . Hugo Gye . These eerie images show the interior of a former courthouse which has remained almost untouched since it was abandoned nearly two decades ago. The Old Town Hall in Sheffield hosted the city's crown court for 100 years, but now the Grade II-listed building in danger of demolition. Photographer Dan Circa captured the atmospheric pictures, which show how the benches and docks in each courtroom are still in place. Abandoned: The Old Town Hall in Sheffield was formerly used as the city's crown court but is now entirely unused . Inside: A courtroom inside the building, where the benches and docks are still intact two decades later . Cells: The paint is peeling off the tiles on the walls and ceiling of the police cells located in the basement of the court . Overhead: The courtroom looks as if it has only just been vacated despite being unused since 1997 . There are also objects formerly used by those who worked inside, such as telephones and legal documents - while the cells below the court can also be visited. 'It's such a rare sight to see and roam free in somewhere like this,' said Mr Circa, 28, from Manchester. 'The cells felt very oppressive, I sat in one with the door closed for a good ten minutes, just thinking if I had been locked away for real. 'The courtrooms had a smell of damp in the air and had a very theatrical atmosphere. Left behind: A crumbling law book used by barristers and judges was found inside the building . Dusty: A landline phone remains in place inside the Old Town Hall, while crown insignia hints at its former use . Staircase: The Grade II-listed building is unoccupied and in danger of destruction despite campaigns to save it . Office: The door into the room provided for solicitors during the building's time as the crown court . 'Although there wasn't a lot inside, there were some legal reference books and keys for the cell doors. 'I bet all the prisoners that had been locked away wished they could have got their hands on them at the time.' He took the photographs after being allowed in by builders working on the site. The Old Town Hall was built in 1808, and it was turned into the crown court after a replacement hall was built at the end of the century. Haunting: Photographer Dan Circa described the cells as 'oppressive' and said they depicted the atmosphere of the time . Locked away: Those appearing in court would be kept in these cells in between their hearings . Untouched: The cells still have their original beds installed, although paint is flaking off nearly every surface in the building . Surveillance: The doors of the cells were fitted with peepholes to allow warders to see inside . It played host to a number of notable cases - including the murder trial of Ian Wood, who shot dead his pregnant mistress in 1986 before fleeing to France and trying to throw himself off a cathedral. However, in 1997 the city opened a new court building, and the hall was sold off and left to crumble. Local campaigners have long called for the hall to be filled once again so that Sheffield can make the best use of its historic heritage. In 2007, the Victorian Society named it one of the most endangered 19th-century buildings in the UK. Entrance: The Old Town Hall was built in 1808 and the interiors boast a neo-classical design with columns and pediments . Fears: Campaigners are concerned that the building has been allowed to follow into disrepair despite its historic and architectural importance . Fireplace: Some rooms show clear signs of their neglect and now look like a building site . Layout: This photograph shows the lawyers' benches as well as the jury box, located on the right of the image . 'I want to bring this place to the attention of the masses in hope that they will make good use of the building,' Mr Circa said. 'Instead of staying empty this place could be used for TV shows, or made into a museum, restaurant or art gallery. 'It's such an important part of Sheffield's history that I feel it is just wasted sat there like this. 'These photographs of the courts and cells create a big reaction from the public, with most people say I'm lucky to have seen such a place without actually getting into trouble.' Misbehaving? The location of this cigarette makes it look as if a barrister was smoking in the courtroom . Modern: Another courtroom looks as if it could still be in use today . Carving: The insignia of the crown is included in the wooden pediments over the building's doors .

The former butcher, who has ran the chip shop for 25 years, made all the burgers himself using an old recipe and ordered huge buns to accommodate the meat.

There's no point doing something half-heartedly. You have to go to the extreme to get noticed.’ The Ulti-Meatum is a large cheeseburger, cooked into a larger burger with two other burgers for buns. It is made by putting one cheeseburger inside another cheeseburger and using two deep fried cheeseburgers as buns. Tomatoes, lettuce and bread buns are then added around it, to create the monstrosity. In Cartoon Network programme The Regular Show, 'Himalayan Ketchup' is also added. The Regular Show sees characters Blue Jay and Rigby try and avoid working as groundskeepers at the local park. One of its voice actors is former Luke Skywalker actor Mark Hamill. The Clarksons have form when it comes to creating huge foods. MailOnline reported three weeks ago how they created the world's largest Ferrero Rocher caked in batter. Mr Clarkson made an 11lbs version of the sweet made famous in the 'ambassador's party' TV advert - but gave it an extra twist using his own recipe. It is ten times the usual size of one. He came up with the idea after an initial batch of normal-sized Ferrero Rochers dipped in batter proved to be a surprise hit with customers.","Cheeseburger encased in another burger and held together by two buns .

"By . Martin Robinson . Fiona Dickie: The beauty queen now struggles to wear stilettos as a result of the crash . A beauty queen received £18,000 in damages yesterday after a car crash left her unable to wear high heels comfortably. Fiona Dickie, 24, was hit by a Suzuki 4x4 while driving, leaving her with back injuries that make slipping into stilettos a painful experience. Incredibly, despite her injuries, the 24-year-old went on to win the Miss Edinburgh competition in 2010 following the collision in April the previous year, but her ability to take part in charity events has been limited because of continuing back pain. She raised an action at the Court of Session in Edinburgh suing the other driver Mohammadreza Khandani, also of Edinburgh, for damages following the collision. Khandani admitted liability but he wanted to pay around £3,500 but Miss Dickie wanted closer to £20,000. The court heard that the accident occurred on April 10 in 2009 shortly after midnight in Edinburgh’s South Clerk Street as Miss Dickie returned home from working at a drinks promotion event. She was left shocked and distressed and suffered bruising to her chest and pain in her neck and back. The sales manager went home after the accident but later phoned NHS Direct because she was in pain. A nurse said she should consult her GP and she was subsequently referred for physiotherapy, where Miss Dickie was later diagnosed with chronic low back pain. After deciding on the £18,000 compensation today, which included £10,000 for 'pain and suffering' judge Gordon Reid QC  said: 'The pursuer (Miss Dickie) is an attractive young woman and also carried out some work as a model, usually at charitable events. 'She did not wish however to have a career as a model. 'She was expected to wear high heels for this promotional work. Doing so aggravated her back.' Mr Reid said that after she won the Miss Edinburgh contest her main duty was attend and take part in charity events. 'Her ability to participate in the usual range of such events was limited because of her continuing back pain,' he said. Payout: The Edinburgh Court of Sessions, pictured, heard today that she would be getting £18,000 - £10,000 of which was for pain and suffering . 'The pursuer felt she was letting people down by not participating in as many events as, but for her back pain, she would other wise have done. She gave as an example various fun runs in which she was not able to participate. 'In spite of her attractive looks and the promotional work which she carried out the pursuer was very much against women being employed on the basis of their looks. 'She strongly opposed the WAG (wives and girlfriends) culture and part of her purpose in wishing to become Miss Edinburgh was to encourage young girls to be independent, to be their own boss and not to rely on men,' he said. 'She has adopted a sensible attitude to her continuing back problems. Sje knows she can wear high heels but will suffer the next day for doing so. It seems to me that rather than being criticised she should be commended for her efforts . 'In the present case it is abundantly plain on the evidence that since the accident she has complained of and suffered intermittent lower back pain. She did not suffer such pain before the accident. 'She is not exaggerating her injuries to enhance the value of her claim. If she is, it is a strange way of going about it. She returned to work, resumed part-time employment over and above her day job and continued her modelling and charity work,' he said. The judge awarded her a total of pounds 18,281, including pounds 10,000 for her pain and suffering.","Fiona Dickie hurt her neck and back after her car was hit by a Suzuki 4X4 that undertook her and then swerved back to avoid a parked car .

Although women performed what had been male-dominated roles in plants all over the country during the war, it was a Willow Run worker - one of an untold number of women in its 40,000-person workforce - who caught the eye of Hollywood producers casting a 'riveter' for a government film about the war effort at home.

Massive scale: Fuselage sections for B-24E Liberator bombers being completed before going to one of the two final assembly lines of Ford's Willow Run plant . Although many Rosies were let go once the war was over and the soldiers returned home, they had shown that women were capable of doing jobs that had traditionally been done by only men. An illustrated poster of a determined-looking Rosie the Riveter rolling up her sleeve with the slogan, 'We can do it!,' became an iconic symbol of female empowerment for American women.The Willow Run factory went back to making automobiles after the war ended, and it did so for more than a half-century under the General Motors name before closing for good in 2010.Now, Doe and other donors are hoping to save at least some of the massive structure to convert it into the new home of the Yankee Air Museum. The museum's original headquarters burned down in 2004, and it is currently housed at Willow Run Airport in Van Buren Township, which is near Ypsilanti Township, where the plant is located.

Worker's cottage: These typical homes near the Willow Run bomber plant would have housed many of the factory's workers . 'We now have the opportunity to actually take a piece of this plant. It's due to be demolished over the next two or three years,' said Dennis Norton, president of the Michigan Aerospace Foundation. 'There's no further use for it. It's too big. It's too old to be used in modern-day manufacturing.'Organizers of the 'Save the Willow Run Bomber Plant' campaign say they need $8 million to fund their 'separation' plan. They want to acquire part of the five-million-square-foot plant, secure it and re-establish utility services such as water, gas and electric.They have raised $4.5 million of what they need and are hoping to entice major donors to come forward with six- and seven-figure commitments.Detroit's historic bankruptcy filing two weeks ago isn't expected to have any effect on fundraising, said Dan Pierce, a spokesman for the effort.'We have not heard this from any prospective donors and don't think we will,' he said.

The factory closed for good in 2010 and is slated for demolition . Yankee Air Museum backers are hoping to tap into some of that patented Rosie resolve in their efforts to transform Willow Run. The hulking facility currently is in the hands of the Revitalizing Auto Communities Environmental Response Trust, which took over sites around the country left behind in the bankruptcy of GM.Much of the plant has fallen into disrepair, including the portion the Yankee Air Museum is eyeing. The factory floor is littered with debris that sits among rusted-out and busted-up equipment once used to make transmissions.Norton and his colleagues hope to change that soon.The millions left to raise represents 'a significant amount of money,' he said.'However, if we didn't think we could do it, we wouldn't have started it in the first place.'","Detroit factory that made almost 9,000 bombers for WWII is slated for demolition .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . After decades of historians denying that the Carthaginians sacrificed their children as described in Greek accounts, a new study claims to have found ‘overwhelming’ evidence that the ancient civilisation really did carry out bloodthirsty practice. Carthaginian parents ritually sacrificed young children as an offering to the gods and laid them to rest in special infant burial grounds, according to a team of international researchers. They said that the archaeological, literary and documentary evidence for child sacrifice is ‘overwhelming’. Carthaginian parents ritually sacrificed young children as an offering to the gods and laid them to rest in special infant burial grounds called tophets, according to a team of international researchers. A tophet outside Carthage is pictured . Carthaginian parents ritually sacrificed young children as an offering to the gods and laid them to rest in special infant burial grounds called tophets. The practice could hold the key to why Ancient Carthage was founded in the first place. Babies of just a few weeks old were sacrifice. Dedications from the children's parents to the gods are inscribed on slabs of stone above their cremated remains, ending with the explanation that the god or gods concerned had 'heard my voice and blessed me'. An Oxford University professor said that people might have sacrificed their children out of profound religious piety, or a sense that the good the sacrifice could bring the family or community as a whole outweighed the life of the child. We think of human sacrifice as a terrible practice because we view it in modern terms, but people looked at it differently 2,500 years ago. The backlash against the notion of Carthaginian child sacrifice began in the second half of the 20th century and was led by scholars from Tunisia and Italy - the very countries in which tophets have also been found. It was first documented by Greek and Roman writers who seemed more interested than critical of the unusual practice. A collaborative paper by academics from institutions across the globe, including Oxford University reveals that previous well-meaning attempts to interpret these ancient burial grounds, called tophets, simply as child cemeteries, are misguided. Instead, the researchers think the practice of child sacrifice could even hold the key to why the civilisation was founded in the first place. The research pulls together literary, epigraphical, archaeological and historical evidence and confirms the Greek and Roman account of events that held sway until the 1970s, when scholars began to argue that the theory was simply anti-Carthaginian propaganda. 'It's becoming increasingly clear that the stories about Carthaginian child sacrifice are true. This is something the Romans and Greeks said the Carthaginians did and it was part of the popular history of Carthage in the 18th and 19th centuries,' said Dr Josephine Quinn, of the university’s Faculty of Classics, who an author of the paper, published in the journal Antiquity. 'But in the 20th century, people . increasingly took the view that this was racist propaganda on the part . of the Greeks and Romans against their political enemy and that Carthage . should be saved from this terrible slander,’ she said. The city-state of ancient Carthage was a Phoenician colony located in what is now Tunisia. It operated from around 800BC until 146BC, when it was destroyed by the Romans. The Antonin Thermal baths are pictured in Carthage, which are listed as World Heritage by UNESCO . 'What we are saying now is that the archaeological, literary, and documentary evidence for child sacrifice is overwhelming and that instead of dismissing it out of hand, we should try to understand it.' The city-state of ancient Carthage was a Phoenician colony located in what is now Tunisia. It operated from around 800BC until 146BC, when it was destroyed by the Romans. Babies of just a few weeks old were sacrificed by the Carthaginians at locations known as tophets. Dedications from the children's parents to the gods are inscribed on slabs of stone above their cremated remains, ending with the explanation that the god or gods concerned had 'heard my voice and blessed me'. Roman writers tended to describe child sacrifice as more of an eccentricity than a crime. Gaius Marius is illustrated in sacked Carthage . Dr Quinn said: 'People have tried to argue that these archaeological sites are cemeteries for children who were stillborn or died young, but quite apart from the fact that a weak, sick or dead child would be a pretty poor offering to a god and that animal remains are found in the same sites treated in exactly the same way, it's hard to imagine how the death of a child could count as the answer to a prayer. 'It's very difficult for us to recapture people's motivations for carrying out this practice or why parents would agree to it, but it's worth trying. 'Perhaps it was out of profound religious piety, or a sense that the good the sacrifice could bring the family or community as a whole outweighed the life of the child. 'We have to remember the high level of mortality among children – it would have been sensible for parents not to get too attached to a child that might well not make its first birthday.' Dr Quinn said that we think of human sacrifice as a terrible practice because we view it in modern terms, but people looked at it differently 2,500 years ago. 'Indeed, contemporary Greek and Roman writers tended to describe the practice as more of an eccentricity or historical oddity – they're not actually very critical,’ she said. 'We should not imagine that ancient people thought like us and were horrified by the same things.' The backlash against the notion of Carthaginian child sacrifice began in the second half of the 20th century and was led by scholars from Tunisia and Italy - the very countries in which tophets have also been found. Dr Quinn said: 'Carthage was far bigger than Athens and for many centuries much more important than Rome, but it is something of a forgotten city today. Babies were sacrificed by the Carthaginians at tophets. Dedications from the children's parents to the gods are inscribed on slabs of stone above their cremated remains, ending with the explanation that the god or gods concerned had 'heard my voice and blessed me' A tophet in Marsala, Sicily is pictured . 'If we accept that child sacrifice happened on some scale, it begins to explain why the colony was founded in the first place. 'Perhaps the reason the people who established Carthage and its neighbours left their original home of Phoenicia – modern-day Lebanon – was because others there disapproved of their unusual religious practice. She explained that child abandonment was common in the ancient world and human sacrifice is found in many historical societies, but child sacrifice is relatively uncommon. ‘Perhaps the future Carthaginians were like the Pilgrim Fathers leaving from Plymouth – they were so fervent in their devotion to the gods that they weren't welcome at home any more, Dr Quinn said. 'Dismissing the idea of child sacrifice stops us seeing the bigger picture.’","Bodies of children were buried in special cemeteries called tophets .

'Because of the commitment of the Bush administration and the American people, millions of lives have been saved.' But Obama said he wants to change the approach. 'We are looking at a new model that's based not just on aid and assistance, but on trade and partnership,' he said. For example, he said he doesn't want to just provide food aid but help for Tanzanians to grow their own. 'Ultimately, the goal here is for Africa to build Africa for Africans,' Obama said.

By contrast, Mr Obama has only visited Africa once before during his presidency, and has not prioritised the continent despite the fact that his father was from Kenya.

'Given the budget constraints, for us to try to get the kind of money that President Bush was able to get out of the Republican House for massively scaled new foreign aid programs is very difficult,' Mr Obama said. 'We could do even more with more resources. But if we're working smarter, the amount of good that we can bring about over the next decade is tremendous.' Foreign policy adviser Ben Rhodes said that having both leaders in one African country at the same time 'sends a very positive message that both political parties in the United States share a commitment to this continent'.

"By . Meghan Keneally . Updated: . 05:59 EST, 14 November 2011 . Charged: Jerry Sandusky was charged with 40 counts relating to sexual abuse of minors . The child sex abuse scandal surrounding the actions of former Penn State assistant coach Jerry Sandusky continues to grow as details about his family life come to light. Additionally, the governor of Pennsylvania is adding fuel to the fire, speculating Sunday that more victims will be added to the list of eight boys who were allegedly sexually violated by Sandusky. When he retired from his defensive coaching position at Penn State, Sandusky cited his need to more family time and dedication to his charity The Second Mile, which helped underprivileged children who were living in foster homes. He and his wife Dorothy raised six . children, all of whom were adopted, and one of whom tried to kill . himself shortly after moving in with the Sanduskys. The first recorded time that Jerry . Sandusky's behavior was called into question dates back to his son . Matt's suicide attempt in 1995. Matt, now 32, came into the Sandusky home through The Second Mile, after having a troubled childhood. Even after getting involved with the . charity, Matt ran into legal trouble at the age of 16 when he burned down a barn and . was taken in as a foster child by the coach and his wife for two years . before being legally adopted by the couple. Shortly after he moved into the house, however, Matt tried to kill himself, prompting some raised alarms. His probation officer became . concerned about his well being and wrote letters to a judge saying that . she was concerned about Matt's 'safety and his current progress'. Handcuffed: Eight young men have been identified . as the targets of sexual advances or assaults by Sandusky from 1994 to . 2009, prosecutors said . Jerry Sandusky's book Touched, which was released in 2001 . The probation officer, Terry Trude, . said that she had spoken with Matt's biological mother Debra Long who . was also worried about Matt, hoping that his living situation would be . reviewed by the court. Local Pennsylvania newspaper The . Patriot-News released the court records of Matt Sandusky's adoption, . including a letter that he wrote to the court imploring the judge to . allow him to stay with the family. 'I would like to be placed back with . the Sanduskys. I feel that they have supported me even when I have . messed up. They are a loving caring group of people. I love both my . biological family and the Sandusky family,' he wrote at the time. Matt has been unflinching in his . support of the family, singing their praises to a sports Illustrated . reporter when Jerry Sandusky left Penn State in 1999. 'My life changed when I came to live here,' says Matt. 'There were rules, there was . discipline, there was caring. Dad put me on a workout program. He gave . me someone to talk to, a father figure I never had. I have no idea where . I'd be without him and Mom. I don't even want to think about it. And . they've helped so many kids besides me,' he continued. Matt is still extremely close with . his family, and that hasn't seemed to change since the news of the . scandal, much to his ex-wife's chagrin. Matt's ex-wife Jill Jones is fearful . for the couple's three children in light of the allegations of Jerry . Sandusky's sexual abuse, and got a court order to prevent their two daughters and one son from spending any alone time with their grandfather. Heyday: Jerry Sandusky (centre) is a star in football circles as he is closely identified with the school's reputation as a defensive powerhouse . The order was issued during the week . of the scandal, but that didn't stop Matt from bringing his daughters, . aged nine and seven years old, and their five year old son from visiting the alleged pedophile. Angered: Pennsylvania governor Tom Corbett said Sunday that while they fulfilled their legal obligation, the coaches that knew of the abuse did not fulfil their moral one . Court records show that Matt took the three children to visit their grandparents on November 5, the day that the charges were announced. In an effort to lessen her concern, Jerry's wife Dorothy called her former daughter in law to tell her that the children would be safe in the house. The call didn't change Jill's mind, however, and she still asked for the court order, which prevents the children from staying overnight in their grandparent's house. There is no evidence to believe that Sandusky ever abused his grandchildren, but the documents say that there is a 'fundamental disagreement over the validity of the charges against Jerry Sandusky and the risk he poses to children'. The case continues to gain momentum as speculation grows that there will be more names added to the list of eight victims. Pennsylvania governor Tom Corbett said Sunday that in addition to the illegal acts of Jerry Sandusky, coaches Joe Paterno and Mike McQueary were guilty of not fulfilling their moral obligation. 'When the word gets out, when people understand that authorities are actually doing something about this, that they may be believed, then more people come forward,' Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett said Sunday. 'As governor, I have a requirement to make sure that we protect the children of Pennsylvania,' Mr Corbett continued. 'In my opinion, when you don't follow through, when you don't continue on to make sure that actions are taken, then I lose confidence in your ability to lead. That would be the case here,' he continued. 'I've always have said, your actions speak louder than your words. That should not have been able to continue. The actions or the failure to act while maybe not criminal, caused me not to have confidence in the president and in the coach.' Former leaders: Jerry Sandusky (left) was the defensive line coach under head coach Joe Paterno (right) before Sandusky retired in 1999 .

"By . Ruth Styles . From Peruvians in flamboyant cerise and gold skirts to Kenya's Samburu people in their crimson cloaks and beaded collars, the world has no shortage of natty dressers. One woman who knows exactly where to find them is Anne Menke, a Vogue photographer turned traveller who in 2012, scoured the world for stylish citizens. Now Menke is back with a new and updated version of her book See The World Beautiful which includes the results of a perambulation around Mongolia and a trip to India's holy city, Varanasi. Beautiful: Varanasi, on the banks of the River Ganges, is one of India's holiest cities but that doesn't mean its residents can't dress - these women look beautiful . And as these incredible photos reveal, there's no shortage of style, whether in the snowy Alaskan wilderness or in the remote Kenyan bush. 'My favourite thing as a fashion and travel photographer is to go a little farther up the mountain, a little farther down that bumpy dirt road, to show the ways people in remote places work and play and live,' writes Menke in the introduction. 'I eagerly trekked neverending miles and timeless hours, from Jujuy Province, Argentina to Ulan Bator, Mongolia to Lijang, China and Quebec Province, Canada. 'Between fashion shoots for Vogue, Condé Nast Traveler and other magazines, I was lucky enough to glimpse the beauty of indigenous cultures – their immensely differing, but each in its own way traditional, iconographies, architectural modes, and styles of dressing. 'Meeting people with such wildly dissimilar references and exploring new socio-cultural terrain is the source and inspiration of my life. To be able to share that with the world is an incredible gift.'

Highlights include a stunning photo of Argentina's 'Angel Horses' with wings created by the cow-hide shield attached to them by ranchers and a striking shot of a Honolulu girl, pretty in a grass skirt and bright garland of flowers. Other stars include a pair of Kenyan women who combine their demure floral dresses with colourful turbans and the Inuits dressed in glamorous pale fur and leather ensembles. 'Fashion is where you find it, provided . you are receptive to its ever- presence in everyday life,' adds designer Tommy Hifliger in the foreword. 'I have . travelled the globe with Anne and feel that she captures the true essence . of beauty in her imagery, far from mainstream media, from the deserts . of Boliva to the waters of the Ganges River!'

Howard confessed to the murders, but his public defenders argue that he should be found not guilty by reason of insanity. Scroll down for video . Trial begins: D'Andre Howard (left) is currently on trial for the 2009 murder of Amanda Engelhardt's (right) sister, father and grandmother. Howard and Amanda were engaged at the time of the fatal stabbings, which allegedly started after Howard accused Amanda of cheating . Her side of the story: Howard's trial began Wednesday, and his public defenders are arguing that he should be found not-guilty by reason of insanity. Amanda was the first to testify, and is pictured on the left in court on Wednesday . Family photo: Amanda (bottom left)  recounted in court the night she watched her fiance kill three members of her family. Father Alan, 57 (top left), sister Laura, 18 (center), and maternal grandmother Marlene Gacek were stabbed to death by Howard. Her mother Shelly, now 57 (top right), was also stabbed but survived and brother Jeff (bottom right) was away at school . 'He does have a mental illness preventing him from appreciating the criminality of what he was doing' Public defender Georgeen Carson said. Amanda was the first to testify Wednesday about the night of the murders, as her ex-fiance sat calmly in court. Amanda told the jury that she and her boyfriend of three years had gotten into a fight the night before, when he accused her of cheating on him at the apartment they shared with their then 8-month-old daughter. Howard allegedly ordered Amanda to leave and take the baby with her, so Amanda's parents Alan and Shelly Engelhardt picked her and the baby up and drove her back to their Hoffman Estates home. The fight: The night before the attack, Howard and Amanda allegedly got into a fight when he accused her of cheating. The two lived together with their then 8-month-old daughter. Amanda is pictured with their daughter in the above photo posted to Facebook . However, Howard showed up at the family home later, around 1:45am, when he continued to fight with Amanda. Amanda finally got some rest when she thought he left, but was awakened soon by Howard who was holding a knife to her throat. Howard then brought Amanda down to the home's den, where he tied her and her mother Shelly up and threatened to kill the rest of the family in front of them. 'He said because Amanda ruined his family, he was going to ruin ours,' Shelly, now 57, said in her testimony Wednesday. 'He told them he was going to make them pay,' Cook County Assistant State’s Attorney Kristin Piper said. He went on to wake up Amanda's 18-year-old sister Laura, and tied her up as well. At some point he untied Laura, and she quickly grabbed his knife and stabbed him. This caused him to react 'on a very primitive level,' his defense said. Fighter: Howard tied up Amanda, her mother, and then her sister Laura (pictured with their father above). He untied Laura at one point and she grabbed the knife and stabbed him. He fought the knife back and snapped - stabbing her several times. Laura did not survive . The two fought for the knife and Howard won. He 'became so angry, he repeatedly stabbed Laura in the chest, over and over and over,' Assistant State's Attorney Kristin Piper said. When mother Shelly started screaming, he also stabbed her and she would spent the rest of the bloodbath drifting in and out of consciousness. Her screaming caused both Amanda's father Alan, 57, and maternal grandmother Marlene Gacek, 73, to wake up and move towards the den. Protecting his family: Howard fatally stabbed Alan Engelhardt when he woke up and responded to his wife's screams. Pictured above in a family photo his widowed wife posted on Facebook . Howard first stabbed Marlene in the kitchen and then went on to slash Alan's throat. Laura, still conscious, and her sister started begging Howard to call 911, but he refused for an entire hour as their family members suffered painful deaths. Eventually Howard relented and called police, telling an operator what he had done. By the time police arrived, it was too late to save Amanda's sister, father or grandmother. Mother Shelly survived but was seriously injured. Too late: Howard eventually called police, and told a 911 operator that he committed the murders. By the time police arrived on the scene, it was too late to save Amanda's sister, father or grandmother . In her testimony on Wednesday, Amanda described her ex-fiance's behavior in the aftermath of the stabbings. She says he kept pacing between the den and the kitchen, apologizing 'off and on to everybody', saying 'he was very sorry demons had gotten him'. Howard allegedly tried to hide the murder weapon, but did not flee. When police arrived, they found him lying down between Shelly and Laura. Amanda also talked about her sister Laura's last words to Howard. She says he was laying down next to her when he apologized, and that Laura said 'that she forgave him'. Shelly also testified on Wednesday, and talked about her family's relationship with the young man. She said they treated him like another member of the family, and that he even lived with them for about a month at one point. The Engelhardts invited him to family events and church. One of the family: Shelly Engelhardt told the jury that she treated Howard like a family member, and that he was invited to family events and church. Frames memorialize the husband, daughter and mother she lost in the attack, as shared on Facebook . Howard's defense team is trying to win the case by proving he was insane at the time of the stabbings. He apparently tried to fire his defense team the day before the jury was seated. Public defender Carson says his mental illness 'boiled up and led him to kill the only family he ever had'. Howard remained calm as he listened to his ex-fiancée and her mother testify, but did cover his face at one point. Amanda's brother Jeff Engelhardt, who was away at school at the time of the stabbings, was in court on Wednesday to support his sister and mother. 'I am really proud of her,' Jeff told CBS Chicago of his sister. 'She was really brave and I knot it is tough for her.' Brother: Amanda's brother Jeff, who was out of town at the time of the stabbings, was in court on Wednesday to support his sister and mother .","D'Andre Howard killed three members of fiancée Amanda Engelhardt's family in the early hours of April 17, 2009 .

"By . Emma Innes . A six-year-old boy has stunned doctors by taking his first steps - despite battling a brain tumour which left him unlikely to ever walk. Joshua Humphreys was just two years old when he was diagnosed with a benign tumour that had been growing inside his brain even before he was born. The tumour delayed his development as a toddler - meaning he hadn’t started learning to walk. He also suffered from tremors and also had to wear nappies until the age of five. Joshua Humphreys, six, has beaten the odds to take his first steps despite battling a brain tumour . Joshua (pictured with his sister, Phoebe) was diagnosed with a benign brain tumour when he was just two . But Joshua has defied the odds by taking his first few steps with the aid of a walking frame and has even set his sights on completing a 2km charity run this weekend. His mother Lisa, from Altrincham, Greater Manchester, said: ‘Joshua has dealt with everything so well and is such a brave little boy, he is amazing. ‘The doctors couldn’t promise us that he would ever walk, but ever since he got his walking frame it has allowed him to be so much more independent. ‘He walks like a toddler and is very unsteady on his feet, so it is a real struggle for him, but he is very determined.’ She added:  ‘I couldn’t believe it when he said he wanted to run a marathon - we were just having breakfast one morning and he turned to me and said “mummy, I want to do a marathon”. ‘And it is amazing as it has all been entirely his choice - he decided he wanted to do it and that he wanted to raise money for The Christie Hospital where he receives treatment. Joshua's tumour was picked up when his parents took him to specialists because they were concerned that he had not learned to walk. He is pictured with his mother, Lisa . In early 2010 Joshua had surgery to remove the tumour but he then had to have another operation in May 2010 because doctors were worried that they had not managed to remove all of the tumour the first time . ‘I did have to let him down gently though and tell him he couldn’t do a marathon, but we sat down together and decided on the Mini Manchester 2km run. ‘He is going to do it all on his own with his frame and said that if he isn’t too tired at the end he wants to cross the finish line without his walker, just holding his dad’s hand.’ Joshua's parents first became concerned when he was two, when they realised he was taking a long time to learn to walk. Mrs Humphreys and her husband Colin, 37, took him to see countless doctors, but were repeatedly reassured that he would learn in time. But, unconvinced, they took him to see a neurologist who delivered the heartbreaking news in December 2010 that Joshua had a brain tumour and needed immediate surgery. In September 2010 Joshua's parents were told his tumour had returned and he had chemotherapy to shrink it . Joshua (pictured with his sister, Phoebe) is now in remission but is still having regular check ups . Joshua is now learning to walk with a frame and it is hoped he will eventually walk independently . Joshua was rushed into theatre on New Year’s Eve to reduce the fluid on his brain, before undergoing a 12 hour operation a few weeks later to ‘debulk’ the tumour. He then went under the knife again in May 2010 after surgeons realised they may have missed some of the growth. Then at a routine check-up in September 2010, the family - who had since welcomed baby girl Phoebe, now three - received heart-breaking news that Joshua’s tumour had returned. Mrs Humphreys: ‘When Joshua was first diagnosed he was only two, so he didn’t really understand what was going on. ‘It was terrifying when we found out that he had been living with a tumour for so long - I felt like I was to blame in some way for it because it had started during pregnancy. ‘And watching our baby go through chemotherapy was awful. He was extremely ill from it and couldn’t eat at all - he had to be fed through a tube in his tummy. Joshua is now planning to take part in a sponsored 2km run to raise money for the hospital that treats him . Mrs Humphreys said: 'Joshua has dealt with everything so well and is such a brave little boy, he is amazing.' She is pictured with her husband, Colin, and children Joshua and Phoebe . Mrs Humphrey said: 'Watching our baby go through chemotherapy was awful. He was extremely ill from it and couldn't eat at all - he had to be fed through a tube in his tummy.' He is pictured with his sister, Phoebe . ‘He lost all of his hair and looked so pale and fragile. And they had to reduce it after a year as he just couldn’t deal with the dosage. ‘It was a horrible time for us a family. ‘And poor Phoebe was just a new-born baby and was being passed from pillar to post as we were spending so much time in the hospital with Joshua which was really difficult.’ Joshua is now in remission, but has to go back to hospital for scans every six months. Normally, benign tumours can be treated just with surgery. However, if they return, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are sometimes used to shrink them. Joshua is taking part in the Mini Manchester Run on Saturday May 17, and has already raised more than £600 for The Christie Hospital, in Manchester.

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple has patented a new method of tackling the problem of texting while driving by locking out drivers when their car is moving. The patent reveals a system using sensors and even onboard cameras to check if a person is in the driving seat. It even reveals a 'scenery analyser' to tell if the driver is in a safe area. Scroll down for video . Apple's CarPlay uses Siri voice commands to control entertainment and other in-car features. Researchers from Texas Transportation Institute recently found that using voice controls to send text messages while driving - on software including Apple's Siri - is just as dangerous as texting with fingers . In April last year Texas researchers found . that using voice commands to send text messages while driving - on software such . as Apple's Siri - is just as dangerous as texting with fingers. They found that both methods impacted . driver response times equally - but that it often took voice . recognition users longer to fix mistakes with their messages. The findings were then confirmed by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety in . the U.S in June. It similarly found that as mental workload and distractions increase, . reaction times get slower and brain function is compromised. In the run up to the CarPlay release, Apple added Eyes-Free technology to its latest iOS software. The Siri Eyes-Free tool lets users control this the system by voice so they can keep their eyes on the road. Similar apps are already available for Android devices while Microsoft’s Windows Phone comes with a specialized Drive Mode aimed at ‘reducing distractions while you’re behind the wheel’. Apple is also believed to be mulling adding the capabilities to its iOS software, saying it would be . 'a significant selling point in the eyes of concerned parents, and it could lead to legislation that would require all handheld computing devices to disable texting while driving.' Apple announced its iOS in the car service earlier this year. Called CarPlay, the integrated system gives drivers a 'smarter, safer and more fun way to use an iPhone in the car.' It works by linking the car's built-in display and software with iOS 7 and Siri on the iPhone 5, 5C and 5S - and will be rolled out to compatible Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo later this week. Once an iPhone is connected to a vehicle fitted with CarPlay, Siri can be used to access the phone’s contacts, make calls, return missed calls and listen to voicemails. When a user receives an incoming message or notification, they can reply using voice commands. Siri can also read the messages and let drivers dictate longer responses or emails. While driving, CarPlay can guess destinations by scanning the phone’s calendar for appointments, and when used with Apple Maps, Siri will give instructions, warn of any traffic incidents and keep the driver updated with the estimated time of arrival. Drivers' brainwaves were monitored while they talked on the phone and while voice-activated emails were played to them, in a system similar to that used in Apple's CarPlay, pictured. Talking on a phone resulted in a moderate risk, but listening to voice-activated features was classed as an extensive risk . Elsewhere, CarPlay can be used to control music, podcasts and audiobooks on the car's display, pictured, or by asking Siri to pull up what they'd like to hear. CarPlay also works with select third-party apps such as Spotify and iHeartRadio . Drivers can also ask Siri for turn-by-turn directions, which are shown on the car’s built-in display. Elsewhere, CarPlay can be used to control music, podcasts and audiobooks on the car’s display, or by asking Siri to pull up what they’d like to hear. CarPlay also works with select third-party apps such as Spotify and iHeartRadio. ‘CarPlay has been designed from the ground up to provide drivers with an incredible experience using their iPhone in the car,’ said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s vice president of iPhone and iOS Product Marketing. ‘iPhone users always want their content at their fingertips and CarPlay lets drivers use their iPhone in the car with minimised distraction. We have an amazing lineup of auto partners rolling out CarPlay, and we’re thrilled it will make its debut this week.’ A leaked video, posted by app developer Steven Troughton-Smith at the end of January, hinted to what the technology would look like. Troughton-Smith shared screenshots, like the one pictured, about what CarPlay might look like . Other car makers including BMW, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar, Kia, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Peugeot Citroën, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota will be shipping CarPlay-compatible cars later this year.

"By . Sam Webb . Fraudster: Laura Miskell, who has received a suspended prison sentence after she carried out a £55,000 tax credits con while working as a secretary in the government department she was defrauding . A mother carried out a £55,000 tax credits con while working as a secretary in the government department she was defrauding. Laura Miskell lied about her income to the Inland Revenue - who actually paid her wages - to increase the amount of tax credits she would get. Over the seven year fraud the 43-year-old, of Washington, Tyne and Wear, failed to declare her partner was living with her, which would also have affected her entitlement to cash. Her deception was uncovered by a random computer check and her bosses put her under surveillance, which proved she did not live alone. Between 2005 and 2012 she was paid £54,722 she was not entitled to. Prosecutor Kevin Wardlaw told Newcastle Crown Court: 'This was, in fact, a long term benefit fraud. 'At the time of the commission she was employed by the tax credit office, who she subsequently defrauded. 'She was personal secretary to a senior member of staff. She had no contact with the public and was not involved in processing claims. 'Her relationship with a long-term partner came to an end in 2005, however, they reconciled after three months and she failed to declare this. 'Throughout the period of 2005 to the detection of the offences she under-declared her income in order to increase the amount of tax credits she was to be paid.' Miskell admitted ten charges of fraudulent activity. She has since resigned from her post. Judge Hickey, at Newcastle Crown Court, told her: 'You richly deserve to go to prison but your children do not deserve to be deprived of a mother' Judge Simon Hickey told her: 'You were employed by the very tax credit office you were obtaining the monies through.' The judge said Miskell deserved to go to jail but said she could be spared for the sake of her children and sentenced her to ten months behind bars, suspended for 12 months, with 200 hours unpaid work. Judge Hickey told her: 'You richly deserve to go to prison but your children do not deserve to be deprived of a mother.' Christopher Morrison, defending, said Miskell helps out at a church, is of positive character and is 'highly remorseful and ashamed of her actions' which were motivated by debt and mounting financial pressures. Mr Morrison said: 'It is not suggested in any way she abused her position of employment within Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs in order to effect this deception, continue this deception or conceal this deception.' Joff Parsons, head of Internal Governance Criminal, HMRC said: 'Laura Miskell deliberately abused a system designed to provide financial help to the most vulnerable people in our society. 'HMRC is committed to the highest level of integrity and we take the strongest possible action against the tiny minority who let us all down by falling short of those standards.'","Laura Miskell, 43, defrauded the sum from her employers over seven years .

"By . Andrew Levy . Taoreed Ogboye has been jailed for five years after returning to a life of burglary . Having admitted to 178 burglaries, and with a previous spell in jail for the same offence to his name, Taoreed Ogboye must have been expecting another stint in prison. Instead, the judge gave him another chance and ordered him to take part in a rehabilitation course. Ogboye, 24, began in a positive fashion by starring in a crime prevention video for police, in which he advised families to keep lights on, install alarms and CCTV and keep valuables in safes. But barely a month later he was ransacking people’s homes again. He has now been jailed for five years for the crime spree, which netted around £400,000 of valuables – none of which has been recovered. And the Mail can reveal the initial reprieve was granted despite Ogboye previously receiving a 42-month jail term for burglary, the proceeds of which paid for an Audi TT and an apartment in a luxury development where he rubbed shoulders with pop stars, actors and Premier League footballers. One of his victims, who asked not to be named, said: ‘He wasn’t a drug addict who arguably couldn’t help himself – he was just plain greedy. Why did they give him the chance to offend again?’ Ogboye’s life of crime began when he was 16. By 2007, he was ransacking homes throughout Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and London. He targeted Asian families, believing they would be more likely to have valuable gold and jewellery. Last September, he entered a house in . Luton and took £30,000 of valuables. On December 16 a neighbour alerted . police to a raid on a Watford address and Ogboye was found hiding in a . wheelie bin. At court on April 23, he admitted to three offences and asked for 175 more to be taken into consideration. Judge Andrew Bright, QC, deferred . sentence and put him on the ‘Choices and Consequences’ rehabilitation . programme, under which he had to wear an electronic tag and obey a 9pm . to 6am curfew. Chance: Judge Andrew Bright QC told Ogboye that he had wasted an . opportunity to change his life when he jailed him yesterday at Luton Crown . Court . But as soon as May 28, London-born . Ogboye was back to his old ways, when he and another man broke into a . house in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. More jewellery was taken from a house . in Barnet on June 5. Ogboye, of Hatfield, was arrested after his electronic tag showed he had been in both areas at the time. Appearing at Luton Crown Court . yesterday, he admitted attempted burglary and burglary. He was also . dealt with for the offences he admitted earlier this year. Prosecutor . Neil King described the defendant as a ‘burglar of considerable . professionalism’ whom other criminals paid to act as a ‘burglary . consultant’ by identifying the best properties to target. Veronica Reeve, defending, claimed her . client broke into homes to prove he wasn’t in league with police after . other criminals saw the anti-crime video and assumed he was informing on . them. Jailing Ogboye yesterday, Judge Bright . said he had ‘seemed to be trying’ to leave his life of crime behind but . added: ‘Your commitment was shortlived.’ A Hertfordshire Police spokesman . yesterday defended the rehabilitation programme, saying: ‘Ogboye was . addicted to a lavish lifestyle, which is quite difficult to get away . from. He liked living the high life. ‘He couldn’t be helped but admitted 170-odd offences which might never have been solved otherwise.’","'Professional' burglar Taoreed Ogboye pleaded guilty to three burglaries and two attempted break-ins .

"By . Paul Bentley . He hit an all-time low last week, dumping his fiancée after their wedding invitations had been sent out. But Rory McIlroy was back on top of the world last night. Rejuvenated by his newly single status, the 25-year-old golfer yesterday spectacularly won his first tournament since announcing the split. The Northern Irishman won the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth, Surrey, in what commentators described as an 'absolute masterclass' and 'incredible stuff'. It is not known what his former fiancée, Danish tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, made of his very sudden return to form – but with her first match in   the French Open tomorrow, she is bound to want to prove a point in return. Scroll down for video . From despair, victory: Golfer Rory McIlroy won the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth after splitting from his fiancee last week . Tennis star Caroline Wozniacki had already tried on her bridal dress before her ex-fiance, golfer Rory McIlroy called off their wedding . McIlroy revealed on Wednesday that he had broken up with 23-year-old tennis champion Miss Wozniacki because he was not ready for 'all that marriage   entails'. After a three year relationship, the multi-millionaire said he got cold feet only after they had sent out invitations to their wedding to family and   friends. She had reportedly already tried on her wedding dress. 'The problem is mine,' he said. 'The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realise that I wasn't ready. 'I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we've had. Everyone has been through break-ups and it's obviously   very, very difficult.' At Wentworth yesterday, McIlroy responded by scoring an impressive 14-under total of 274 at the European Tour's flagship event, beating 16 golfers in   the top 50 of the world rankings. Speaking out: Wozniacki took to Twitter to thank her fans for their support, and perhaps make a subtle dig at her Manchester United supporting ex . It was his first professional win since last December and he hasn't won on the PGA Tour since 2012. He missed the cut in his past three BMW PGA   Championship starts. The former world number one had been widely expected to perform badly at the championship, considering the tumultuous week he had. After teeing off, however, he said: 'I have exceeded my expectations so far. I think once you get inside the ropes, you are concentrating on your golf.   It's almost like it's a nice four or five hours of a release in some way just to get everything out of your head apart from doing the job at hand. 'You   can't let your mind wander at all when you're trying to win a golf tournament. It's the hours in the day when you're away from it that are probably a little more difficult. It has been tough.' McIlroy, who is worth an estimated £28million, proposed in Sydney, on New Year's Day after dating Miss Wozniacki for three years. He gave her a £98,000 eight-carat diamond engagement ring after the couple watched fireworks from a boat in front of Sydney Opera House. Split: Tennis star Caroline Wozniacki will play in the French Open tomorrow after golfer Rory McIlroy's 'totally unexpected' break up just days after the couple sent out their wedding invitations . It is thought they were planning to marry at the Rockefeller Centre in New York in a lavish ceremony in November. Miss Wozniacki is due to play her first match at the French Open on Tuesday. Miss Wozniacki, who grew up in Denmark to Polish parents, last week sent a message to fans saying it was a 'hard time' for her and thanking them for   their support. She then, somewhat cryptically, added: 'Happy I support Liverpool right now because I know I'll never walk alone.' The message, which was forwarded thousands of times online, is thought to have been a dig at McIlroy, who is a keen football fan and is known to support   Liverpool's arch rivals Manchester United. It prompted an overwhelming rush of support among sports fans and other female tennis players, with Serena Williams replying: 'I'll always walk with   you. Friends forever.'  Miss Wozniacki had described herself on Twitter as a 'fiancee, daughter, sister, tennis player' and 'mother to our dog Bruno'. But, last week, she   removed the word 'fiancee'. Sources close to Miss Wozniacki's family said she is determined to carry on as normal despite her heartbreak. The former women's world number one, who is worth an estimated £15million, is battling a knee injury as well as the very public humiliation of the   breakdown of her relationship. 'She still wants to play in Paris despite having struggled,' a friend told the Mail. 'It is looking almost certain that she will try to play.'","Northern Irish golfer overcomes week of woe to win major tournament .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . William Henry Welch, 53, escaped punishment for driving without licence because his wife incorrectly told him he would be covered if he borrowed a friend's car . A star of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding escaped punishment for driving without insurance after his wife checked his documentation as he can 'barely read', a court heard. William Henry Welch, 53, avoided six penalty points on his driving licence because his wife incorrectly told him he would be covered if he borrowed a friend's car, a court was told. Welch told Magistrates he asked his wife to look at his documents as he struggles with reading. He was granted an absolute discharge after admitting driving without insurance at Newton Aycliffe Magistrates' Court. Welch is a well-known campaigner for traveller and gipsy rights - and has appeared on My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding among other reality shows. Speaking after the case Welch said: 'It isn’t all doom and gloom when you go to these courts, if you go and you have a reasonable argument the magistrates are willing to listen. 'You should never just give up and think that they won’t listen to you because they will.' The court heard how Welch’s own car had broken down when he was working in Leominster, Herefordshire, and a friend loaned him a Vauxhall Vectra to drive back home. Welch told the court he had rung his wife, Rachel, to check he was covered to drive the Vectra. After reading the insurance policy she told him that he was. Welch of Darlington, Durham, told the court he left insurance documents to his wife because: 'I can barely read.' Mrs Welch, 49, told the court: 'We were both named on the insurance document and so I thought we were both policy holders.' Andrea Milson, prosecuting, told the court that as policyholder, Mrs Welch was covered to drive any car. However, as Mr Welch was a named driver he was only covered to drive the family car and not the borrowed Vectra. Welch, a well-known Gypsy campaigner, told the court he asked his wife to look at his documentation as he can 'barely read'. He has starred in numerous television shows including My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding . The car was stopped by police on the A456 in Worcestershire last August and Welch was subsequently charged with driving with no insurance and no MoT. Welch admitted both charges but, in a rare ‘special reasons hearing’, his solicitor, David Dedman, argued that the licence should not be endorsed with the usual six penalty points. 'This was an honest mistake,' said Mr Dedman. 'He genuinely believed he was insured and was misled by his wife, not deliberately or intentionally.' Magistrates granted Welch an absolute discharge on the matter of no insurance. They imposed no penalty points, but he was ordered to pay costs of £85. He was fined a further £100 for the offence of driving a vehicle with no MoT test certificate. Paddy Doherty walked free from court after headbutting his stepbrother in March . In March, Paddy Doherty, 55,  walked free from court after admitting he headbutted his stepbrother. The 55-year-old breached the terms of a suspended jail sentence when he committed the assault at a pub in Flintshire, north Wales, in October 2013. He was given a six-month supervision order  instead of jail time. The 2011 winner of Celebrity Big Brother had previously been handed a 31-week jail term, suspended for two years, in January 2012, after he brawled in the street with a fellow traveller. The show's infamous dressmaker Thelma Madine was sued by her head designer for unfair dismissal at the end of 2013. A court ruled Ms Madine dismissed Leanne Phillips, who was paid £400 a week to design dresses for the Nico Bridal Company, based in Liverpool, after a heated row. Ms Madine fired the 31-year-old, who she had previously praised with taking her business to 'another level' after six years.","William Welch, 53, avoided six points for driving without licence .

Vicente del Bosque's defending champions will be keen to show the world they are still the team to beat, despite some recent poor performances. With the manager still not having named his final 23 - because of Diego Costa's lingering injury - it will be interesting to see which XI Del Bosque ends up picking, while players on the fringes will want to prove they are worthy of a place in the final squad. Arrival: Andres Iniesta and David de Gea arrive in Seville ahead of their warm-up match against Bolivia . Waiting game: Spain coach Vicente del Bosque will wait until the June 2 deadline to see if Diego Costa is fit . Speaking at a press conference earlier this week Del Bosque admitted he is still playing the waiting game over the Atletico Madrid striker's fitness. 'I'm not sure Costa will make it,' he said. He said that he will wait until the June 2 deadline to give Costa a chance to be fit, but that he wants Costa to be 100 per cent if he is to get there. Defending champions: Arsenal's Santi Cazorla and Bayern's Javi Martinez go into the hotel . Replacement? Fernando Torres could be the man to replace Costa if he doesn't get fit in time . 'We've still got time but now it's in the hands of the doctors and the medical team. We have to be cautious,' he said.

"By . Julian Robinson . Former Chief Inspector for Surrey Police Tanya Brookes brought' shame' on her profession by targeting High Street stores in refunds scam . A senior police officer has been jailed for a catalogue of petty frauds after tricking High Street stores in to giving full refunds for discounted luxury items. Tanya Brooks was a chief inspector at Surrey Police when she carried out the scams, netting more than £11,000 by targeting household names including the White Company, Micro Scooters and Boots. Among the items she bought on the cheap and used for her refund fraud were breast pumps, fertility tests and cashmere blankets. Now she is starting a two and a half year jail term after a judge condemned her for bringing 'shame' on the police service. Sentencing the 46-year-old at Winchester Crown Court, Judge Andrew Barnett said: 'By your criminal activities, you have disgraced the uniform you once wore, you have brought shame on the force that you once served and you will have tarnished the reputation of the police service. The mother-of-four, who worked under her maiden name of Sillett, pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to five charges of fraud by false representation and three of making an article used in fraud. A further five offences which she denied were ordered to lie on file. A further two charges of acting with intent to prejudice/defraud HM Revenue and Customs which were due to be heard at a third trial will also now lie on file. Brookes, of Nursery Road, Godalming, Surrey, was also previously found guilty following a trial of nine offences of making an article used in fraud, 14 of fraud and two of converting criminal property. She was found not guilty of a further two offences. Nicholas Tucker, prosecuting, said at the start of the first trial how Brookes, who was also married to another senior police officer, David, had joined the Surrey force as a university graduate and he described her as a 'high-flyer'. He said that it was as she was about to mark her 20 years’ service in July 2011 that she became the subject of an investigation by her own force. In his opening of the case, Mr Tucker said one of Brookes’s main targets was The White Company. He . said that she would buy items such as Poitier cotton sheets or a . cashmere satin-edge blanket from the chain’s outlet store in Bicester, . Oxfordshire, at a discount rate. She . would then falsify a bank statement on her computer showing that the . full price for the product had been paid and return it to another branch . of the store and fraudulently reclaim the difference in price. Luxury homeware store The White Company was one of her main targets, as she bought cashmere blankets for a discount and took them back to the store with false bank statements . Boots handed out hundreds of pounds to the former chief inspector when she produced false statements claiming she had paid the full price for £130 breast pumps and £120 fertility monitors . She would tell shop staff that the items had been bought by 'an extravagant great aunt'. Mr . Tucker continued: 'Mrs Brookes would often be wearing her police ID on a . lanyard round her neck - this was irregular, and the prosecution say it . was a ploy by Mrs Brookes to capitalise on the trust people tend to . place in police officers.' He . also described how she fraudulently gained a £6,000 discount from a . luxury holiday for her family by falsely claiming that she was a . counter-terrorism officer at Gatwick Airport. The . deceit was in order to claim a discount given to people connected with . the travel industry from specialist holiday firm Caribbean Unpackaged . for the £10,000 trip to Buccament Bay on St Vincent. Mr . Tucker said that Brookes even sent an email to the company saying they . could not pass on her details because her identity was a secret because . of the nature of the role. Mr . Tucker added that as she returned from this holiday, Brookes also . falsely claimed for a damaged Buggaboo buggy worth £849 and a Maclaren . buggy worth £195 from British Airways by providing a forged proof of . purchase from John Lewis. She . had made a similar false claim against Monarch airlines for a £491 . pushchair she alleged had been damaged on a return flight from Tenerife . in May 2009. Former Chief Inspector for Surrey Police Tanya Brookes was sentenced to two and half years at Winchester Crown Court where a judge said she had 'disgraced',the uniform she once wore . In another 'scam' outlined by the prosecution, Brookes offered to organise a stall selling Micro Scooters at her son’s nursery. Mr . Tucker said that despite the fact that the parent-teacher association . decided to decline her suggestion, Brookes went ahead anyway and when . she received the two promotional scooters offered by the manufacturer, . she returned them to the Kingston branch of John Lewis and exchanged . them for vouchers and a different Micro Scooter. Mr . Tucker described another fraud which involved Brookes buying products . such as Sculptinex facial treatments, Clearblue fertility monitors and . Medela breast pumps in bulk and at discount on eBay and returning them . to Boots to claim the difference in price. She . also bought forged discount vouchers for products such as Lurpak butter . on the internet and used them to buy products at reduced price in . stores such as Waitrose, Mr Tucker said. The court was told that her husband had also lost his job as a superintendent as a result of the case. Nicholas Yeo, defending, said that Brookes had suffered a brain injury prior to her offending and a psychiatric assessment had suggested this might have affected her behaviour and ability to make appropriate judgments. But he added: 'Mrs Brookes, in her role as a senior police officer, should have known better and should have set an example.' He said that the offences had led to both her and her husband losing their careers as well as her probably losing her pension. He continued: 'She has, in a very real sense, thrown it all away.' Outlet: Brookes, 46, made trips to Bicester Village, the outlet street in Oxfordshire, to buy cheap items . Mr Yeo added: 'She was so harrowed by the investigation that she has ended up with the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.' In his opening of the case, Mr Tucker said: 'It is our case that despite the healthy salaries which she and her husband enjoyed as senior police officers, Mrs Brookes - for reasons which may remain a mystery - expended an extraordinary amount of effort and her own time devising various scams, principally targeted against high street retailers. 'To compound matters, we say that on occasion she exploited her status as a police officer in order to inspire trust in individuals she meant to deceive.' Following sentencing, Assistant Chief Constable Gavin Stephens of Surrey Police said: 'The sentence handed to Brookes today not only reflects the severity of the offences she committed but also the fact that she used her position as a police officer when committing a number of these offences. 'In her role as a police officer, she should have known better. 'We expect the highest standards of conduct from all of our employees and this kind of behaviour has no place in Surrey Police. 'The vast majority of our officers and staff who serve the people of this county are professional and hard-working and the public rightly trust them to act with integrity at all times. 'We will not hesitate to thoroughly investigate any evidence of wrongdoing and take swift action if any officer is involved in criminality.'","Tanya Brookes made fake bank statements showing she paid full amount .

"By . Mark Prigg . Astronauts have fitted the first HD webcams to the International space station today following a tense spacewalk. Oleg Kotov and Sergey Ryazanskiy were able to get both of the groundbreaking cameras working perfectly, unlike their first attempt where a spacewalk was abandoned. People will be able to access the live footage on a website and the webcams could be used to provide high resolution imagery of the planet for environmental monitoring and to help with humanitarian relief efforts. Scroll down for video . People will be able to access live footage of the Earth taken by the webcams on a website. Here, a simulation of what the site will look like, shows a satellite image of New York as well as a map and the what the camera has filmed . There are two cameras, the world's first 1-Metre . Class, high-resolution Earth video camera and a medium-resolution . imaging camera. As the ISS circles the world 16 times per . day, the two cameras will constantly be rolling and capturing unique . videos and imagery of different locations underneath. Phase 1 . of the project will see two cameras facing the ground, with one having a . fixed gaze and the other one featuring maneuverability to points of . interest. The two men worked so hard — determined to accomplish the job this time — that Russian Mission Control outside Moscow urged them to 'get your breath.' 'We'll force ourselves to rest,' one of the spacewalkers replied in Russian. The astronauts had hooked up the Earth-observing cameras during a spacewalk right after Christmas. But ground controllers received no data from the cameras, and the spacewalkers had to haul everything back in. The problem was traced to indoor cabling and fixed, according to NASA. This time, after the spacewalkers reattached the high-definition camera to the outside of the Russian portion of the space station, good electrical connectivity was reported between the instrument and Russian Mission Control. NASA spokesman Rob Navias said Russian flight controllers were pleased with the results. 'The second time a charm for its installation and activation,' Navias said. Next, Kotov and Ryazanskiy tackled the medium-resolution camera. Images from these new cameras will be distributed by the Canadian company that owns them, UrtheCast (pronounced EARTH-cast) Corp. The cameras were launched to the space station last November in a deal between the Vancouver-based UrtheCast and the Russian Space Agency. UrtheCast will post near-real-time video on its website and sell images. The company envisions customers wanting video feeds for environmental, agricultural and humanitarian purposes. The company expects it will take three months to calibrate the cameras, and that the system should be fully operational by summer. Because of all the camera data trouble during the Dec. 27 spacewalk, which dragged on for eight hours, Kotov and Ryazanskiy had to put off other chores. Those tasks were on Monday's to-do list. The four other space station astronauts — two Americans, one Japanese and another Russian — kept tabs on the spacewalk from inside. The cameras blasted off from Russia today and once installed on the International Space Station (illustrated), will beam live footage of our planet to Earth . Russian flight controllers outside Moscow directed Monday's 260-mile-high excursion . The firm behind the project says that anyone will be able to see the footage via a special website and customers will also be able to buy customised pictures. Basic accounts are free and provide a live stream of imagery as the cameras fly overhead and time lapses of favourite places. Premium accounts for enable users paying a fee to track an area without sharing it with others and to monitor larger areas of interest as well as applying image processing techniques to reveal data. ‘This is the biggest milestone UrtheCast has achieved thus far,’ explained co-founder, President and Chief Operating Officer, Wade Larson. ‘This will be the world’s first ever high definition, live-streaming video platform of planet Earth from the International Space Station.’ Phase 1 of the project will see two cameras facing the ground, with one having a fixed gaze and the other one featuring maneuverability to points of interest. The company’s aim is to make Earth video data more accessible to individuals and schoolchildren, who will be able to log in on UrtheCast’s website, as well as the traditional customers of government and private companies. ‘Video and still image data captured by the cameras will be downlinked to ground stations across the planet and displayed on the UrtheCast web platform, or distributed directly to exclusive partners and customers,’ the firm said. The company said this will be the world's first ever high definition, live-streaming video platform of planet Earth from the International Space Station . Two cameras will be fixed to the ISS: The world's first 1-Metre Class, high-resolution Earth video camera and a medium-resolution imaging camera . Here is an illustration of a camera filming a strip of the earth below. The cameras will be installed on the ISS sometime in December 2013 and are expected to go live in 2014 . ‘UrtheCast's cameras will provide high-resolution video and imagery of Earth that will allow for monitoring of the environment, humanitarian relief, social events and agricultural land.’ Current sponsors on the high profile project include the Discovery Channel, and the firm is working with the Russian Aerospace giant RSC Energia. It is expected to take two spacewalks to install both cameras, and they will last for at least five years. The ISS circles the world 16 times a day, and UrTheCast said its cameras will be constantly rolling and capturing unique videos of different locations under its path (illustrated in orange) The company's aim is to make Earth video data more accessible to individuals and schoolchildren, who will be able to log in on UrtheCast's website .","Canadian company UrtheCast's cameras were fitted on their second attempt - after a first spacewalk failed to get them working .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A husband was forced to give his dying wife CPR because a lone paramedic sent to the scene could not manage on her own, it was claimed today. Alfred Pearce, 65, and his daughter Tracey, 40, battled in vain to save Beryl Pearce after being asked by the first responder to help while she unpacked her equipment and called for back-up. The pair say they had to take it in turns giving mouth-to-mouth and chest compressions in a desperate eight-minute bid to revive their loved one. Traumatic last memories: Alfred Pearce was forced to give his dying wife Beryl CPR after she collapsed at their home because the first medic on scene wasn't able to give CPR without their help, it was claimed . A back-up ambulance eventually arrived . 20 minutes later, but Mrs Pearce could not be saved and died of heart . failure at the scene. Retired . builder Mr Pearce says his family has been deeply scarred by the . horrific events and wants assurances no other families will have to . suffer due to staff shortages. He . said: 'I want things to change so another family doesn’t have to go . through this. The paramedics were all very nice but my daughter and I . were so upset and stressed by what happened. 'My . daughter says she just can’t shake off the image of my wife - her own . mother - lying there and us getting so distressed trying to save her.' Dignified: Mr Pearce says he doesn't blame the apologetic paramedic for the position she found herself in . He added: 'I have to be strong for my family but I still suffer flashbacks of me fighting to keep her alive on the living room floor. 'We should not have had to do that. They should have had enough staff to take over. When you call 999 that is what you expect.' Mrs Pearce, 64, had suffered breathing problems at the couple’s home in Basildon, Essex. Her husband dialled 999 immediately, but was shocked when a female responder arrived in an ambulance alone. He said: 'When the paramedic first arrived, she wanted to move my wife into the ambulance to get some fluids into her. But just as we tried to move her from the hallway my wife collapsed and I knew it was serious. 'We couldn’t get her to the ambulance so we moved her in the living room so there was space for all the portable ambulance equipment. Angry: Mr Pearce is now demanding that the NHS makes drastic changes to its policy to ensure paramedics don't attend emergencies on their own . 'Then the paramedic asked my daughter and I to give Beryl CPR while she got her equipment ready. My daughter started the CPR while I held my wife’s head so she didn’t swallow her tongue. 'The paramedic was talking us through what to do and just kept saying ""sorry about this"". 'I felt sorry for her as she had tears in her eyes and she was shouting ""code red"" into her radio but no back up was coming. After a while, my daughter got so tired and upset I had to take over. 'I was thinking ""Am I doing this right? I might not be pushing hard enough as I’d never done it before"". 'Eventually two more ambulance men arrived and took over. It was probably only about eight minutes but it felt like hours.' Mr Pearce had been married to his childhood sweetheart for 44 years after the pair met for the first time aged 15. His wife had suffered from a long history of medical problems including heart failures, diabetes and asthma and was known to staff at nearby Basildon Hospital. Mr Pearce is now calling for a drastic overhaul of NHS policy to stop paramedics travelling alone to call-outs. Childhood sweethearts: Mr and Mrs Pearce when they were first going out in the 1960s. They had been married for 44 years . The father-of-four and grandfather-of-ten added: 'I’m not saying that if they had sent two people the first time the outcome would have been different but at least they both would have been able to work on her. 'I’ve no qualms with the NHS as Beryl has been brought back from the dead twice by amazing work from doctors and nurses. It’s just upsetting to know my last memories of my wife are so traumatic.' A spokesperson for the East of England Ambulance Service said: 'It is normal practice for all ambulance services to dispatch highly skilled solo responders if they are closest to assess the patient and get immediate life support to them more quickly while another crew is sent for hospital transport and support. 'It is absolutely not true that a clinician cannot administer CPR on their own. The very reason why they are dispatched on their own is in order to administer CPR and other basic life-support to the patient in the quickest possible time as using solo responders means getting a trained clinician with full equipment by a patient's side quicker. 'There may however be times when it is in the patient's best interests for a paramedic to utilise those on scene to help with basic life support under their instruction while, for example, they are unpacking equipment or calling for assistance. Although this reason may not have been communicated to Mr Pearce. 'This of course does not mean they are not capable of carrying out all these tasks, simply that it makes sense to use support under careful instruction and guidance if it is available, although our staff would always respect someone’s decision not to get involved.' 'Our thoughts are with Mr Pearce and his family. We would be happy to discuss this further with him if he would like to contact us.' No-one was available at the service today to explain why the paramedic was unable to give CPR on her own. Mrs Pearce collapsed after the couple had returned from an over-60s Diamond Jubilee Party at around 6pm on Sunday, June 3.","Alfred Pearce and daughter Tracey battled for eight minutes to save Beryl .

"By . Richard Alleyne In Los Angeles . The father of Elliot Rodger's best friend has called for a national debate on gun law and bullying at schools. James Ellis was described by Rodger as his best friend for more than 14 years while they were growing up in the affluent suburbs just north of Los Angeles. The pair met at school and later bonded over Pokemon cards, computer games such as Halo and World of Warcraft, and skateboarding. Lonely: Gunman Elliot Rodger described how he had only one friend, who had provided the only light in his life . But despite both being frustrated at their lack of success with the opposite sex, they drifted apart as Rodger’s feeling towards girls became ever more hostile. Eventually, after a couple of alarming incidents in restaurants, they completely lost touch and went to different colleges. Yesterday Art Ellis, James’ father who is also a close friend of Rodger’s mother, said: ‘It is such a complex situation for me to make a statement. 'Should there be gun control? Yes that would help. They have warnings on Aspirin saying do not use when operating heavy machinery. 'Yet people on medication get a gun in their hands.' The graphic designer refused to talk about his son’s friendship with Rodger but said that much must change in society. 'Children should be aware of the effect they have on other children,' he said. 'These kind of things are not taught at schools.' In his manifesto Rodger spoke about how he met James when he began junior school, and dubbed him King Arthur Kid because he had long blond hair. Agitated: Rodger, pictured, said he would speak to his friend, James, for hours about his troubles . He said that he was ‘kicking dust’ in the playground when he noticed Ellis doing the same. ‘We then teamed up and starting playing the game together, and this was the start of a long and interesting friendship,’ he wrote. ‘This boy’s name was James Ellis, and he would become my best friend for the next 14 years of my life.’ However even in the early days Rodger said he felt left out by his best friend. 'During playdates with James, sometimes he would have other friends over as well, and I would feel very jealous and upset when he paid more attention to them. 'Feeling left out, I would find a quiet corner and start crying.' The pair remained best friends, sleeping over at each other’s houses all the time and still playing video games. During the difficult teenage years in which he became increasingly isolated and frustrated, Rodger said Ellis was his only friend. Parted: Rodger's friendship with James ended when he started to discuss how seeing couples made him angry . 'James would be my only friend throughout the next depressing and lonely period of my life,' he wrote. 'My friendship with James helped me cope with the loneliness. The very few fun times we would have were like a light in the darkness for me.’ As teenagers they talked about their lack of a sex life. 'James was in a similar situation as I was,’ he wrote. 'He was a virgin like me, never having much interaction with girls in his life. 'The two of us talked for hours about our troubles and our hopes of overcoming them. 'It was nice to have such a good friend like James on my side, who could understnd and relate to me.' But their friendship started falling apart when Rodger told James about his hatred and anger towards girls and people who had sex. He started telling James how he wanted to attack couples showing affection in restaurants. 'I thought that James would relate to me, since he was also a virgin who had no girls in his life, but some of the things I said began to disturb him,' he wrote. 'One night, he told me, with a lot of distress, that enough was enough. He didn’t want to hear it anymore.' Their friendship ended and they went to different colleges.","Art Ellis says schools should do more to teach students how their behavior affects others .

"By . Anthony Bond . and Sara Malm . The armed raider who smashed his way into a jewellery shop yesterday, suffering a heart attack, has died. Clinton Townsend, 33, collapsed as he was being restrained by members of the public after attempting to rob the shop in central Oxford. Townsend, from Headington, Oxford, was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died this afternoon. Injury: An armed robber who raided a jewellery shop this morning suffered a heart attack during the robbery. The raid took place inside The Covered Market, pictured, in Oxford . Local shopkeepers have described how . they saw paramedics attempting to resuscitate the man as he was taken by . stretcher to the ambulance. Minutes earlier he and an accomplice . had battered their way into the shop which had just opened for business, . smashing the glass in three windows. The two roared up outside the Covered . Market in Oxford on a stolen motorcycle, before running into the arcade . where they smashed glass in John Gowing jewellery store. Sources said that moments after . confronting the staff - one of who managed to dial 999 to alert the . police - the older of the two raiders clutched his chest and collapsed . unconscious to the shop floor. The other man ran away from the shop, empty-handed. He left his . accomplice behind, along with a black and green motorcycle which was . lying on the ground. A spokesman for the South Central Ambulance Service said the man . had suffered a full cardiac arrest, causing his heart to stop beating. 'The ambulance service was called by the police who said that there was . an ""unresponsive male"" on the floor of John Gowing jewellers' store in . the covered market,' said spokesman James Keating-Wilkes. 'We sent a rapid response vehicle and a double manned ambulance to the . scene and carried out CPR on the patient, who was aged about 40 years. Raid: The ill man was taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital where he is in a 'serious condition' 'We took him by ambulance to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford,' he added. A spokesman for Thames Valley Police confirmed that the collapsed man was in a serious condition in hospital. Eyewitness Mary Faulkner, a sales assistant at a . nearby shop, told the Oxford Mail that somebody sprinted past her in a . full visor and motorbike helmet. 'He was literally running so fast . I had to move out the way,' she said. My first thought was I wonder if . they've stolen something. 'And I later saw police or forensics picking a pick axe or something like that out the bin in Turl Street.' Yaseen Yusef, who works at Tim's . Newsagents in the Covered Market, said that it was believed the robber . might have suffered a heart attack during the raid. He said: 'He was still being resuscitated as he was stretchered on the way to the ambulance. 'He was a big bloke with a tattoo. We have heard he may have had a heart attack, maybe as he was being wrestled to the ground. 'Forensics have been at the shop and CID have visited our shop asking for CCTV footage.' A member of staff at Ducker and Son shoe shop said: 'There have been a lot of police and police cars in the street. 'They were doing CPR on the man, I do not know if he was wrestled to the ground.' A worker at Celebrations party shop added: 'One of our chaps saw one of . the guys run past the shop, he looked like he was wearing a hooded top.' A member of staff at John Gowing Jewellers told the Oxford Mail: 'All . members of staff are okay - this has been a shock, absolutely.' Detective Superintendent Chris Ward, leading the investigation, said: 'We are in the very early stages of our investigation but are keen to . speak to anyone who might have information to help with our . investigation. 'We would especially like to speak to anyone who might have seen a man . who ran away from the scene, leaving the Covered Market via Turl Street, . Oxford. 'The man was wearing a black and white top with blue jeans and might . possibly have been in the area before the robbery happening on a . motorbike, with the registration ending SMV.' Det. Supt. Ward added: 'I am asking anyone who has any information, no . matter how insignificant they believe it to be, to get in touch. 'I would like to reassure residents that I have a team of detectives . working on this investigation to ensure that we catch whoever is . responsible and I urge anyone who might have been in the area of the . Covered Market and seen any suspicious activity, to contact the police . immediately.' Detectives later interviewed the jewellery shop staff to get an account of exactly what happened. Sales assistant Liz Jones, who works in a the nearby Oxford Aromatics store, said: 'It is just a huge shock. 'I can't believe it has happened. I haven't heard of anyone being hurt . at the covered market before. People come shopping here because it is . such a nice, pleasant atmosphere,' she said. A shopper, 66-year-old Mervyn Brooker, said he too was shocked by what had happened. 'It's very worrying. You hear of this sort of thing happening elsewhere . in the country but when it comes to the area where you live and shop, . it makes you think. I am quite worried - it makes you wonder if you are . safe out shopping.' Nothing was believed to have been stolen during the raid.","Two men entered John Gowing Jewellers in Oxford at 9.15am .

Under threat: There were reports the Scotland v Nigeria friendly in London was targeted by fixers . In . the first, teams are handicapped according to their form so a stronger . team must win by more goals for a bet to be successful. ‘I would say I am most worried about these two markets,’ Mutschke told the BBC. ‘We . had training sessions with referees in Zurich. We are also going to . meet them prior to kick-off and we also will visit the team and players . for security sessions. We will give them a reminder to report an . approach from fixers. ‘We have an officer in the stadium and he will . act on my decision if necessary. It will depend on the information and . the response required. ‘He can just monitor the situation regarding . players, referees, others.

"By . Lydia Warren . An army veteran whose pregnant wife allegedly sent ricin-laced letters to President Obama and then told authorities her husband was to blame has suggested she carried out the plot to become famous. Nathaniel Richardson said that although he and his wife Shannon were having problems, he had no idea she was capable of such a plan, which had felt 'like a bad dream'. 'She really wanted to be an actress,' he told ABC News. 'She wanted to get her face out there.' Shannon Richardson, who remains in jail charged with mailing a threatening communication to the president, has had small parts in shows including The Walking Dead and The Vampire Diaries. Scroll down for video . Heartbroken: Nathaniel Richardson said learning his pregnant wife, Shannon Richardson, allegedly framed him for sending poison letters to President Obama was like a 'bad dream' Speaking out: Richardson and his lawyer chat to Savannah Guthrie about the case on the Today show . She initially contacted the FBI claiming that her husband was behind the poisoned letters sent to Obama, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his gun control lobby in Washington. She told investigators she found a suspicious substance in their refrigerator as well as addresses for Bloomberg and Obama written on a note on his desk. But after she failed a polygraph test and authorities found inconsistencies in her story, she was arrested on June 7 at their home in New Boston, Texas. She could face 10 years in federal prison if found guilty. Shannon has five children, aged four to 19, from other relationships and is now pregnant with Mr Richardson's child. Happier times: Nate and Shannon Richardson married in 2011 and are expecting their first child together . Plot: He suggested she implicated him as she wanted to be an actress and it would 'get her face out there' Mr Richardson, who filed for divorce after he was allegedly framed but before his wife was arrested, revealed his shock at discovering she had tried to implicate him. 'It was kind of like disbelief, or it was like a bad dream,' he told the Today show. 'The person she was wasn't real.' Arrest: He filed for divorce from his wife before her arrest on June 7 in connection with the letters . But he vowed that he would not waste his time being angry at his wife, whom he married in 2011. 'She has done this to herself,' he told ABC. 'She has destroyed my reputation and my life but there's a way up from this and if I sit here and focus on anger, I can't focus on getting on with my life.' He insisted he had no part in the plot, and did not even know what ricin was before he was accused of sending the three letters. 'I was calling it licin,' he said. An affidavit said that Richardson finally admitted to receiving syringes and chemicals needed for ricin production in the mail, as well as printing labels for the letters and mailing them. However, she said that her husband had 'made her' send the letters, according to the affidavit. The letters were received last month and contained anti-gun law messages that stated: 'You will have to kill me and my family before you get my guns. 'Anyone who wants to come to my house . will get shot in the face. The right to bear arms is my constitutional, . God-given right and I will exercise that right till the day I die. 'What’s in this letter is nothing compared to what I’ve got planned for you.' Probe: Authorities search the couple's home in New Boston, Texas in May after Mrs Richardson told authorities she had found a suspicious substance in the fridge and Obama's address written on a note . Led away: She was taken into custody on June 7 after admitting to sending the three ricin-laced letters . Richardson claimed that her husband was behind the plot as he is a well known bigot. 'He’s racist and hates Obama. Everyone knows that,' she said to the New York Post denying any claims that she was to blame. The letter to the president was received at a mail screening facility and did not reach the White House. One of the letters sent to Bloomberg was retrieved at the City Hall, and the second arrived at the headquarters of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which Bloomberg operates and personally finances. Shannon Richardson's attorney told ABC: 'I have seen no evidence to even suggest that my client desired to hurt the president or any of the other individuals involved.'

"By . Lydia Warren . Elliot Rodger was beaten up, left with a broken ankle and robbed of his Gucci sunglasses after he tried to push girls off a ledge for not talking to him at a party, his manifesto has revealed. The 141-page document, which the 22-year-old virgin emailed to his parents and friends before he killed six people on Friday, gives terrifying insight into Rodger's hatred towards women for failing to pay him attention. In one excerpt from last year, he wrote about heading out to party in Isla Vista just days before his 22nd birthday in one 'last ditch effort' to lose his virginity. 'That was the only thing that could have saved me,' he wrote in the memoir. 'I was giving the female gender one last chance to provide me with the pleasures I deserved from them.' Scroll down for videos . Lonely: Gunman Elliot Rodger described how he had only one friend, who had provided the only light in his life . He described how he bought a bottle of vodka and drank a few shots before heading out so that he could get some courage to enter the party - although he admitted he drank a little too much. At the party, he quickly became irritated that no one was talking to him, especially girls who were chatting with 'obnoxious slobs' instead, he wrote. So he went outside - but there he saw guys walking with 'hot blonde girls on their arm', which 'fueled me with rage', he said, explaining that he felt that these girls should have been giving him attention. He climbed onto a ledge and - after miming as if he was shooting them - some of the crowd joined him, including 'rowdy boys whom I've always despised' and some girls. While up there, he became annoyed that none of the girls were talking to him, so he began insulting them, he said. 'A dark, hate-fueled rage overcame my entire being, and I tried to push as many of them as I could from the 10-foot ledge,' he wrote. 'My main target was the girls. I wanted to punish them for talking to the obnoxious boys instead of me.' But the group fought back and eventually, he was pushed to the ground. When he fell, he heard a 'snap' in his ankle, breaking it, he said. Agitated: Rodger, pictured, said he would speak to his friend, James, for hours about his troubles . As he limped away, he realized that his Gucci sunglasses were missing and went to get them back, but was so drunk, he couldn't remember where the party was. Instead, . he went to a nearby house and demanded to know where his glasses were. A . group of 'brutes' started calling him names before dragging him out to . the driveway and hitting him, he said. Elliot Rodger . 'I had never been beaten and humiliated that badly,' he said. 'Everyone in Isla Vista saw what happened, and it was truly horrific. 'The worst part of this whole ordeal was... the fact that no one showed any concern... If girls had been attracted to me, they would have offered to walk me to my room and take care of me. They would have even offered to sleep with me to make me feel better.' The next morning, he awoke to pain and . his father took him to the hospital, where police interviewed him. Fearful that he could get in trouble, he told them he had acted 'cocky' towards a group of boys, so they had pushed him from the ledge. The . police didn't pursue any charges, he said. Victims: Rodger's first victims included his roommates Weihan Wang, left, and Cheng Yuan Hong, right . Gunned down: George Chen, left, was also found . stabbed to death in their home - although he did not live at the house - . while Rodgers gunned down Chris Michael-Martinez, right, when he opened . fire at a deli . Murdered: Katie Cooper, left, and Veronika Weiss, right, were shot outside a sorority house during his spree . As he recovered from his broken ankle, Rodger's self pity grew and he focused on his 'Day of Retribution,' deciding to enact his 'revenge' in the spring of 2014. On Friday, Rodger, the son of Hunger Games assistant director Peter Rodger, acted upon his threats, killing six people before shooting himself dead. Elliot Rodger . Weihan Wang, 20, of Fremont, and Cheng Yuan Hong, 20, of San Jose, were both stabbed to death by Rodger on Friday at the apartment they had shared with him. Investigators are looking into whether he killed the pair in their sleep. The body of another UCSB student, George Chen, 19, of San Jose, was also found at the apartment, but he did not live there. Rodger . then climbed into his SUV and drove towards the Alpha Phi sorority . house, where he shot dead Katherine Cooper, 22, and Veronika Weiss, 19. He . then got back into his car and drove to a nearby deli, where he opened . fire. There, he killed student Chris Michael-Martinez, 20, in an attack . that was captured on surveillance footage. Remembered: Students write messages at a tribute to the victims at one of the crime scenes on Monday . The gunman then climbed back into his car and continued to shoot at passersby as he drove, hitting three pedestrians before he police officers returned fire and shot him in the hip. He tried to escape and knocked down a cyclist, before he eventually shot himself in the head and smashed into parked cars. When police found his body, he was surrounded by three semi-automatic handguns and nearly 400 rounds of ammunition, which had all been purchased legally.","In his rambling memoir, Elliot Rodger detailed going out to a party last year in one last ditch attempt to lose his virginity .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . 'Severely distressed': U.S. student Melody Davis (pictured) died two weeks after suffering a heart attack in a hospital car park when staff insisted her friends call 999 for help instead . A student died after being turned away from a hospital reception while suffering an asthma attack as staff insisted her friends had to dial 999 for help instead. Pretty Melody Davis passed away from swelling on the brain two weeks after gasping for breath in the car park of the Royal Liverpool University Hospital. As the 20-year-old sat in the car, a friend ran into the hospital reception to plead for help, but was told 'phone for an ambulance' despite Melody being just 50 yards from A&E. The hospital has since reviewed its policy for responding to medical emergencies within the hospital grounds. But Liverpool Coroner’s Court heard the decision to take Melody to the hospital by car rather than call paramedics 'was the wrong one' and the coroner said he would not attach 'culpability' to the NHS. The court heard Melody's two friends, Grace Kelly and Elizabeth Port, frantically tried to get help when the attack began on October 12, 2010, but neither had a mobile phone. Instead, the pair took the decision to drive her to hospital. On the way to the city centre hospital, Melody was in 'severe distress' as she held her head out of the window battling for air. She even tried to get out of the vehicle in panic. When they arrived at the hospital car park in Mount Vernon, Grace ran into the reception to plead for help for her stricken friend. The medical student was told she had to call 999 and despite her screams of dismay was turned back to the car, where Elizabeth was supporting 'swaying' Melody to the entrance. She collapsed before reaching the door and an ambulance arrived to take her the few yards to the A&E department. Merseyside Coroner Andre Rebello told the court the ambulance came from another location in the city centre and was on service to another hospital. A post mortem examination found that Melody, from San Jose, California, died from hypoxic brain injury brought on by acute bronchial asthma. 'Too late': Melody collapsed before reaching the reception of the Royal Liverpool University Hospital (above), where an ambulance arrived to take her the few yards to the A&E department . As Mr Rebello discussed the findings with forensic pathologist Dr Peter Good and asthma expert Dr Simon Taggart, Melody’s father Roy listened via a telephone link from the USA. Mr Davis told the court about his daughter, who had moved to Liverpool to study English Literature at the University of Liverpool. He said: 'She started in the fall of 2008 and had been studying for two years, but would come home for the summer. 'Melody was in her third year and would have graduated the following summer. 'She was interested in English culture and knew about Liverpool because of The Beatles and her research into the country, so she chose to go there.' Mr Rebello told the court of the findings presented in the report by Dr Taggart, who claimed that the 'decision to put Melody in the car was the wrong one'. Pathologist Dr Peter Good . He continued: 'Paramedics carry the appropriate equipment in case of an asthma attack of this nature and calling 999 would mean the medicine is brought to them.' Similarly, the findings from Dr Good stated that 'lack of awareness' was a factor in deaths caused by asthma attacks. Dr Good wrote: 'The decision to travel by car is a common factor in deaths through asthma attacks. 'At the time of arrival, she was one to two minutes from respiratory arrest and no amount of emergency care would have saved her.' Despite The Royal Liverpool Hospital changing its policy on treating patients in a car park following Melody’s death, Mr Rebello declined to apportion blame. Tearful Mr Davis asked the coroner if staff at the Royal Liverpool Hospital were at fault, but Mr Rebello said he would not to attach 'culpability' to the NHS. He also told the grieving father, who lives with his wife Dorothea in San Jose, that Melody’s friends acted in her best interests. Mr Rebello told Melody’s father: 'I am sure you would have liked attention to have been given in a different way when Melody arrived at the hospital. 'But the experts say that was not causative to her death. 'I’m hoping that the tragedy and upset you have suffered will enable other parents to take heed of the advice and to phone 999. 'In that way Melody’s death would not have been in vain.' A spokesman for the Royal Liverpool University Hospital said: 'Our thoughts are with Melody's family at this time and we would like to again offer our heartfelt sympathies. 'We note the comments of Dr Taggart, the asthma expert, in this case about the need to educate the public and asthma sufferers on the importance of using the emergency ambulance services. 'Since this tragic incident, the Trust has reviewed its policy for responding to medical emergencies within the hospital grounds. This includes advising the public on the need to contact the emergency ambulance services.' Verdict: Natural causes.","'Distressed' Melody Davis driven by friends to hospital after gasping for air .

The 'Go Fast Jet Pack' has a maximum speed of 77mph (124km/h) and can reach heights of 250ft (76metres) It is fuelled by a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and nitrogen. The nitrogen provides a ‘push’ for the hydrogen peroxide through the motor, which converts it to high temperature and high pressure steam inside rocket nozzles that allows the machine to fly. The jet-pack provides 300lbs of thrust or 800 horsepower for 33 seconds, but in the future, pilots may be able to embark upon longer trips using the technology. Currently they can only cover distance of up to 2,500ft (760metres).

The jet-pack provides 300lbs of thrust or 800 horsepower for 33 seconds, but in the future, pilots may be able to embark upon longer trips using the technology . While the fuel is non-explosive and non-flammable, the jet-pack still dangerous compared to other modes of transport and requires at least 100 hours of training to operate it. The vehicle is currently not available commercially. The demonstration of the jet-pack, which its makers claim is a ‘green eco-friendly machine,’ took place in Washington at Smithsonian Magazine's Future is Here festival which was hosted at the Ronald Reagan Building and International trade Center. It was driven by performance pilot Nick Macomber, who works for the firm behind the technology. Jet PI built the machine based upon an old model developed built by Bell Systems in the 1960s, but made it lighter, faster, long-flying and economical. It claims to be building the ‘world’s most advanced personal flying machines. Another jet-pack designed and piloted by Swiss inventor Yves Rossy uses jet engines for propulsion. Up and away!

Free as a bird: Yves Rossy's amazing jet wing, pictured, blurs the line between a plane and a jetpack and while it cannot take off vertically, it uses jet engines its wings offer stability . While it is easily manoeuvrable, the pack features a cumbersome carbon fibre wing, measuring just over 6.6ft (2.2m) across. Because of its frame, the Swiss jet-pack also has to be deployed from a helicopter and cannot take off from the ground. The Martin jet-pack, however, can take off vertically and is possibly the most similar in appearance to the ‘Go Fast’ jet-pack, despite being quite a bit larger.

"By . Claire Ellicott . A young patient who died of dehydration at a leading teaching hospital phoned police from his bed because he was so thirsty, an inquest heard yesterday. Officers arrived at Kane Gorny's bedside, but were told by nurses that he was in a confused state and were sent away. The keen footballer and runner, 22, died of dehydration a few hours later. Hospital: Kane Gorny, 22, pictured with his mother Rita, needed drugs to regulate his hormone levels after successfully beating brain cancer. However, during a hospital stay nurses forgot to give him his medication . A coroner had such grave concerns about the case that she referred it to police. Yesterday an inquest was told how Mr . Gorny died after blunders and neglect by 'lazy and careless' medical . staff at St George's Hospital in Tooting, South London. His mother Rita Cronin, a civil . servant told Westminster Coroner's Court that staff tutted at her and . repeatedly refused to listen to her concerns that her son hadn't been . given vital medication. At one point he became so desperate . and upset that staff sedated and restrained him – and on the night . before his death, his mother said, he was not checked on by medical . staff, despite being in a room on his own. Following his death, a nurse allegedly . inquired whether the family, from Balham, South-West London, was . 'finished' and asked a matron in front of them whether she could 'bag . him up'. Mr Gorny, who worked in Waitrose and . was training to be a locksmith and shoe repairer, had survived a . malignant brain tumour in 2008. Inquest: Rita Cronin, left, and Kane's father Peter Gorny arriving at their son's inquest. Rita told the court she had tried to convince the staff at the hospital her son needed urgent attention but they insisted he was alright . The cancer affected his pituitary . gland, which controls the body's mechanisms, such as fluid levels. Part . of his treatment included a course of steroids to regulate the fluid . levels in his body. These drugs, however, weakened his bones and he was . in hospital for a routine hip replacement. Doctors told him that, without regular medication to control his fluid levels, he would die. When he arrived at hospital for the . hip operation, nurses assured the family they would give him his . medication and said: 'Don't worry, he's in good hands – we'll look after . him.' But, despite the repeated reminders . and insistence by both Mr Gorny and his family, staff failed to give him . the tablets and he became severely dehydrated after being refused . water. In an interview with the Daily Mail in . 2010, Miss Cronin said of the nurses who treated him: 'They were lazy, . careless and hadn't bothered to check his charts and see his medication . was essential. He was totally dependent on the nurses to help him and . they totally betrayed him.' Yesterday Miss Cronin told the inquest . she received a distressed phone call from her son on May 27, 2009, in . which he told her he'd called the police because he was so desperate for . a drink. Help: Police raced to St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London (pictured) but were turned away by staff . She then went to the hospital where . she found him 'confused and angry', shouting at staff and behaving in an . uncharacteristically abusive manner. Despite this, one doctor asked if he . was 'coming off the booze' and another asked if he was 'always like . this'. Miss Cronin said: 'He sounded really, really distressed. He said . ""They won't give me anything to drink"". 'He also said ""I've called the . police. You better get here quickly: they're all standing around the bed . getting their stories straight"".' When Miss Cronin arrived, she . recalled: 'They weren't doing anything. They seemed out of their depth. It felt like the two locum doctors were nervous about calling anyone . more senior than them.' The inquest heard Mr Gorny was . restrained by security guards and sedated with strong medication to calm . him down. Later, he was put into a side room and left alone. Miss Cronin said she sat in his room . for three hours the night before he died without a single nurse checking . on him or giving him vital medicine. 'He was starting to enjoy his life . again, even though he had pains in his hip.' Kane's mother Rita Cronin . She said she told a nurse who walked . past the room that Mr Gorny had not had his medication.  When Miss . Cronin volunteered to return to the hospital should he wake, another . nurse allegedly told her: 'You don't need to do that. If he makes noise, . I'll close the door and then he won't wake everyone up.' She added: 'I later realised that her comment was unbelievable but I was so distraught that it didn't register.' The morning of her son's death, May . 28, 2009, Miss Cronin arrived at the hospital early to find him . delirious with swollen lips and a swollen tongue. She recalled: 'I then heard three . nurses outside his room and I said: ""There's something wrong with my . son. He doesn't look right."" 'The nurse said to me ""He had a good night. There's nothing wrong with him and he's just had breakfast and a chat with us."" 'I thought: ""How could he have had breakfast? There's no evidence (of breakfast)."" 'The nurse carried on her handover then I interrupted again and said: “He's not right.” 'The other nurse then tutted and said: . ""She's already told you he had a good night."" And with that the three . of them walked off.' Miss Cronin said she then noticed that . her son hadn't been given his medication because the packet was still . on the table by his bed. She told the locum doctor about her concerns, but the doctor said it wouldn't do him any harm. A doctor doing the rounds then checked . on Mr Gorny. Miss Cronin said: 'He took one look at him then he started . calling to everyone “Get in there quickly”. 'It suddenly dawned on me he hasn't . had his medication, hasn't had his bloods done, nobody's given him a . drink, nobody's bothered to put his drip back on him. 'Nobody's done anything since yesterday afternoon when he became aggressive.' She said there was a 'flurry of . activity' and everyone 'had a very sad look on their face' as they . battled to save her son's life. Miss Cronin said: 'The main doctor came . out and you could tell he was really angry. He said: “You need to go and . see your son. He's dying.” The couple then found their son lying . in blood and fluid-soaked sheets and a nurse came in and asked them to . help her to change them. The same nurse later came into the matron's . office and asked whether they were 'finished', adding: 'Can I bag him . up?' The death certificate said Mr Gorny died of a 'water deficit' and 'hypernatraemia' – a medical term for dehydration. Mr Gorny had radiotherapy and . chemotherapy following his diagnosis of brain cancer. He was eventually . given the all-clear and led a normal life until his mother noticed he . was having trouble with his hip. As he waited for the surgery, his life started to return to normal. 'He was out and about like everybody else,' said Miss Cronin yesterday. 'I always used to make him take his . tablets for the next morning, just in case he stayed at a friend's house . – and he knew the importance of his medication. We all did. 'He was starting to enjoy his life . again, even though he had pains in his hip. He was upset he was having a . hip replacement - he was worried he would be in a wheelchair when he . was 50.' Nurses at the hospital were said to have been offered counselling as a result of Mr Gorny's death. The inquest continues. The case is still being considered by the Crown Prosecution Service.","Nurses forgot to give Kane Gorny his medication and he became so delirious he called 999 .

"By . Rick Dewsbury . A coroner launched a scathing attack . yesterday on ‘incompetent’ staff at a leading teaching hospital where a . young man died of dehydration after dialling 999 in desperation. Kane Gorny, 22, phoned police from . his bed because he was so thirsty, but nurses and doctors ignored his . requests for water and he died the following day. In a devastating verdict, deputy . coroner Shirley Radcliffe said there had been a collective failing by . staff at St George’s Hospital, Tooting, south London, who all refused to . take responsibility for their roles. Hospital: Kane Gorny, 22, pictured with his mother Rita, needed drugs to regulate his hormone levels after successfully beating brain cancer. However, during a hospital stay nurses forgot to give him his medication . She added that the ‘target-driven’ culture in the NHS and the European Working Hours Directive, which . limits the number of hours medical staff can work, had played a part in . his death. Just one nurse has been demoted as a result of Mr Gorny’s . death after a routine operation and the rest are still working in . healthcare. Yesterday Mr Gorny’s mother Rita . Cronin, 52, said: ‘We put our trust in them and they let us down. If I . had taken him home and left him to die like they did, I’d be in prison . now. ‘I saw everything that went on and I knew who was involved. ‘If I’d seen any remorse, I would have been a little bit more forgiving. But I saw no remorse. ‘They didn’t seem to take into . account the fact that a life had been lost, but how they could get round . the fact that they did nothing for my son. ‘They were only interested in their . own jobs. He hated that hospital. If I’d have taken him home after his . operation as he wanted me to, he’d still be alive today. ‘He was an incredible human being who . fought cancer and won only to lose his life because of failings by . incompetent medical staff.’ Mr Gorny had survived a malignant brain . tumour in 2008, but the cancer affected his pituitary gland, which . regulates the body’s fluid levels, and he was prescribed medication to . help him retain water. Inquest: Rita Cronin, left, and Kane's father Peter Gorny arriving at their son's inquest. Rita told the court she had tried to convince the staff at the hospital her son needed urgent attention but they insisted he was alright . He was also put on steroids to . replace lost hormones, but they weakened his bones and he went into St . George’s Hospital for a hip replacement in May 2009. Nurses assured the family: ‘Don’t worry, he’s in good hands – we’ll look after him.’ But during the inquest at Westminster . coroner’s court it emerged that nearly all the staff involved in his . care neglected to read his medical notes or learn about his complex . condition. Nurses ignored his requests for water . and routinely failed to carry out basic tasks such as giving him his . vital medication and checking his fluid and sodium levels. After Mr . Gorny resorted to calling police because he was so thirsty, nurses told . officers he was in a confused state and they left. He phoned his mother, a civil servant . from Croydon, Surrey, who recalled: ‘He sounded really, really . distressed. He said, “They won’t give me anything to drink”. ‘He also said, “I’ve called the . police. You better get here quickly: they’re all standing around the bed . getting their stories straight”.’ She added that when she arrived at . the hospital: ‘They weren’t doing anything. They seemed out of their . depth. It felt like the two locum doctors were nervous about calling . anyone more senior than them.’  She described the nurses who were . supposed to look after her son as ‘lazy and careless’. Mr Gorny became more and more dehydrated and sodium levels in his blood rose. He died of water deficit and hypernatraemia, a medical term  for dehydration, three days after  he arrived. The case raised such grave concerns that the coroner referred it to police. No criminal charges have been brought. In a narrative verdict yesterday, Dr Radcliffe said: ‘Kane Gorny died as a result of dehydration contributed to by neglect.’ The coroner said Mr Gorny was . ‘undoubtedly let down by the incompetence of staff, poor communication, a . lack of leadership, both medical and nursing, and a culture of . assumption’. Happier times: Mr Gorny, who worked in Waitrose and was training to be a locksmith and shoe repairer, was denied the medication and sodium levels rocketed to an abnormally high 164 . St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London, where Mr Gorny died of thirst after 'incompetent' staff continually refused him a drink of water . She added: ‘The European Working . Hours Directive is a factor  here which means a succession of junior . doctors are involved in a patient’s care. ‘[It] is causing lives to be lost on a large scale in this country. ‘This target culture puts . considerable pressure on junior doctors to deal with A&E referrals . at the expense of ward-based issues.’ In dramatic testimony last week, Miss . Cronin told the hearing that staff ‘tutted’ at her and refused to . listen to her concerns that her son had not been given the medication he . needed so desperately. A police officer told the five-day . hearing that Mr Gorny had twice shouted: ‘Nurse, can I have some water?’ and was ignored by all the medical staff present. Nurses and doctors on the ward said . he became angry and lashed out at them, so security guards restrained . him and he was sedated and moved into a side room  by himself. The inquest heard that the lack of . fluids, combined with the failure of medical staff to give him his . medication, may have made him confused and aggressive. But consultant orthopaedic surgeon . Philip Stott allegedly  asked whether he was on drugs or coming off . alcohol, though he  told the inquest he could not remember this. The inquest heard that routine . observations were not carried out because nurses did not want to wake Mr . Gorny in case he became ‘aggressive’ again. His fluid chart was not filled in . properly and his drugs chart was not checked by doctors, so it went . unnoticed that he had not had vital medication since he arrived. A spokesman for the hospital said: . ‘We deeply regret the death of Kane Gorny and have apologised . unreservedly to his family for the grief this has caused.’ A letter had been penned by Dr Bridle, left,  detailing the rare condition of Mr Gorny, right, but doctors and nurses on the ward did not see it . Kane Gorny dies following basic errors by doctors and nurses. The staff included: . Failed to follow up: Simon Birdle . SIMON BRIDLE: Consultant orthopaedic surgeon in charge of his care who failed to monitor him. When Mr Gorny became agitated, Bridle sent a more junior doctor rather than attending himself. He then failed to follow up the incident or check on his patient’s welfare. ADELA TAACA: Nurse in charge of his care the night before he died. She failed to give him vital medication or carry out important observations because she did not want to wake him in case he became aggressive. Taaca also ‘forgot’ to tell a doctor to check his high sodium levels, despite them being the highest she had ever encountered. She was demoted to a healthcare assistant and is being investigated by the Nursing and Midwifery Council. 'I just went home': Phillip Stott . PHILIP STOTT: Surgeon who operated on Mr Gorny but failed to read his medical notes. He arranged for the patient to be sedated, removed his drip and then left without linking his behaviour to his medical condition. Instead, Stott asked Miss Cronin whether Mr Gorny was on drugs. He told the hearing: ‘I didn’t follow it up. I should have done but I didn’t . . . I just went home.’ VICTORIA AGUNLOYE: Locum junior doctor who dismissed the concerns of Mr Gorny’s mother moments before his death. She said she knew Mr Gorny was suffering from a rare condition called diabetes insipidus, but failed to link this to his behaviour. She claimed she did not check on the patient when his mother asked her to on the morning of his death because he was not her patient. Failed to monitor fluid levels: Sharon Gibbs . SHARON GIBBS: Nurse who failed to monitor Mr Gorny’s fluid levels after he was sedated. She admitted she had not recorded that his drip had been taken out and lost track of his water output, leaving boxes on his fluid balance chart empty. She also failed to link his aggressive behaviour to the fact he had not been given his medication, despite knowing about his condition. ERLINDA EDWARDS: Nurse who carried out pre-operative checks on Mr Gorny  but failed to highlight his condition to  other staff. She also neglected to detail his medication and the fact that he suffered from diabetes insipidus on a ‘communication’ sheet. This . meant other medical staff were unaware of his condition as none of them . wanted to read through his substantial medical records. Blamed target culture: Dr Konstantinos Karras . DR KONSTANTINOS KARRAS: On-call doctor who was told by a nurse that Mr Gorny had very high sodium levels and was asked to attend, but failed to do so. He also failed to pass the concern on to the night on-call doctor. He blamed the target-driven culture for preventing him from seeing Mr Gorny. POORIA HOSSEINI: Junior locum doctor who failed to investigate the real cause of Mr Gorny’s behaviour shortly before he was sedated. He said that this was because Mr Gorny was Agunloye’s patient. She said he was Dr Hosseini’s patient. He left for the evening without chasing up the blood test results which may have provided an explanation for Mr Gorny’s behaviour.","Kane Gorny, 22, died of thirst after nurses denied him a glass of water .

"By . Steve Nolan . Getting caught anywhere remotely close to the site of a natural disaster would be a nightmare for most people. But getting up close and personal with mother nature at her destructive worst is a dream for one avid photographer. Martin Rietze has spent the last decade travelling the length and breadth of the earth to take these incredible pictures of some of the world's fiercest volcanoes violently erupting. Scroll down for video . Fireworks: Sakurajima Volcano captured by Martin Rietze in January this year. He has spent a decade travelling the globe trying to snap the most dramatic pictures of violent volcanic eruptions . Violent: The Sakurajima Volcano in Japan, pictured here, is a notoriously unpredictable volcano. One of his pictures of the volcano was a Nasa picture of the day earlier this year . Stormy: Scientists are uncertain as to why lightning occurs during some eruptions. One theory is that it is caused by charge-inducing collisions in volcanic dust . Daredevil: Martin Rietze pictured taking photographs at Krakatoa volcano, Indonesia . The 49-year-old has risked life and . limb to get as close as he can to erupting volcanoes in places like . Chile, Tanzania, Italy, Iceland and Antarctica. He . takes time out of his day job as an engineer to travel thousands of . miles at the drop of a hat and has got so close to the action that he . has burnt his skin with hot lava in the past and even passed out because . of their poisonous gases. Mr . Rietze said: 'One has to know when it is safe to come near and when it . is a matter of survival to stay away, sometimes many miles away.' A . great deal of planning goes into Mr Rietze's expeditions. He tries to . catch volcanoes when they are their highest levels of activity, but . calculating the ups and downs of the eruptions can take days to . complete. Feeling hot: Streaks of lava are pictured on Mount Nyiragongo, Congo. It last seriously erupted in 2002 though it is still active . Nature's show: The avid photographer captured this stunning image of lava spewing from the Stromboli Volcano, in Italy . Dangerous: A river of lava flows down the Ol Doinyo Lengai, in Tanzania. To capture distant volcanoes, Martin needs to set aside two weeks . Live wire: Lava spills from the top of mount Stromboli in Italy. The volcano has been in almost continuous eruption for the last 2,000 years . Incredible: This impressive shot of Stromboli looks more like a firework than an act of nature . Hot stuff: A lava pool bubbles over violently at Mount Etna in Sicily. Martin's fascination with volcanoes began when he saw Etna erupt as a child . Bright: An amazing image of the Sakurajima Volcano, in Japan. He tries to catch volcanoes when they are their highest levels of activity, but calculating the ups and downs of the eruptions can take days to complete . He has to put aside a fortnight if he hopes to get some good shots of volcanoes further afield. The German photographer said each volcano requires a different approach. He . gives active stratovolcanos a wider berth as they can throw out lava . bombs that travel several miles and create pyroclastic flows. These . flows are currents of hot gas and rock that reach temperatures of . 1,000C and travel up to 500MPH. Such a deadly surge destroyed Pompeii in . 79AD. Globe-trotter: Streams of lava are pictured pouring out of the Stromboli volcano. Martin has trekked to volcanoes all around the world including ones in Chile, Tanzania, Italy, Iceland, and Antarctica . Drama: The Eyjafjallajkull volcano, in Iceland, pictured erupting in 2010, when it caused travel chaos with flights grounded by a resultant giant ash cloud . Eruption: This picture of the Ol Doinyo Lengai volcano, in Tanzania, looks almost like a work of art rather than a dramatic picture of a volcanic eruption . Fiery: Smoke billows from boiling hot lava at the top of Mount Nyiragongo, Congo . Natural light: A stunning picture of Iceland's  Eyjafjallajökull volcano erupting at dusk back in 2010 . However, 'red . volcanoes' create meandering lava flows and pyrotechnic displays that . can be viewed from relatively nearby.

"By . Vanessa Allen . and Becky Barrow . and James Salmon . A junior technician in India caused the RBS computer meltdown which froze millions of British bank accounts, it was claimed last night. The ‘inexperienced operative’ erased a massive swathe of information during a routine software upgrade for the Royal Bank of Scotland and its subsidiaries NatWest and Ulster Bank, according to reports. The worker was understood to have been part of a team recruited in Hyderabad after the bank laid off more than 20,000 UK staff and outsourced work abroad. The failure of RBS computers was allegedly the fault of a young technician in India . Deleted information had to be painstakingly re-entered into the bank group’s computer system, stalling an estimated 100million transactions. RBS refused to comment on the claims which were reported on technology website The Register. The group’s share price rallied . slightly after RBS and NatWest claimed they had finally . cleared the backlog on their accounts, although more than £1.7billion . has been wiped off the taxpayers’ 82 per cent stake in the group since . the disruption began. Shares slumped 9.1 per cent to 227.7p. The stock recovered slightly, up 2.2p to 229.9p, in early trading today. The Register reported that the computer operator was carrying out an upgrade to the CA-7 software banks use to run their vast network of transactions. As he checked the update, he accidentally erased a mass of data, the site claimed, adding: ‘A major error was made. An inexperienced person cleared the whole queue... they erased all the scheduling.’ Stephen Hester, RBS chief executive, said there was 'no evidence' that the system failure was connected to the decision to outsource jobs to India . A source told the Mail the problems were exacerbated because the botched update was applied to both the banks’ back-up systems and the live computer – a worryingly basic mistake. Millions of payments, including wages, disappeared from accounts leaving customers unable to withdraw cash, check their balance or settle bills. Finance watchdogs warned the fallout from the computer meltdown could take weeks to sort out. Sir Mervyn King said the slow reaction from RBS to the system failure needed to be questioned . Bank of England Governor Sir Mervyn King told the Treasury select committee that questions needed to be asked about why the crisis had gone on for so long after the computer failure last Tuesday night, and called on the Financial Services Authority to launch a ‘very detailed investigation’. The FSA said: ‘We will expect RBS-NatWest to provide us with a complete account of the issues once this is fully resolved and to take any necessary steps to ensure that the risks of these problems occurring again are addressed.’ The computer failure was so catastrophic that RBS and NatWest still do not know how many of their 15million customers were affected. Ulster Bank said 100,000 of its 1.9million account holders were hit. Analysts believe the debacle could cost the banking group £100million in compensation and overtime payments. NatWest was forced to open 1,200 branches across the country over the weekend to clears a massive backlog of payments . RBS . and NatWest said their accounts were now up-to-date but admitted ‘a . small number of customers’ could still suffer delays and said account . holders at Ulster Bank still faced unacceptable delays. The . Financial Ombudsman Service warned the chaos could go on for weeks and . said it has been flooded with 500 calls a day from customers. A spokesman said: ‘No one can really anticipate how long the disruption will go on for – but it could be weeks until the bank manages to sort out every complaint.’ Knock-on effects could include problems with charges for late payments and issues with credit ratings if customers have been unable to pay bills or transfer money. RBS head of customer services Susan Allen said: ‘We have made an error, we have been clear all the way through that we will make sure that customers and non-customers don’t lose out as a result of that.’ She said she was ‘embarrassed’ such a mistake had happened. Last February, RBS advertised for a series of key jobs, paying between £9,000 and £11,000 a year for computer graduates with several years of experience using CA-7. RBS has said the at-fault software was ‘UK-based’ and its computer servers are based in Britain, but insiders said many of their support teams were in Hyderabad. Chief executive Stephen Hester said there was ‘no evidence’ the debacle was connected to the bank’s decision to outsource jobs to India. The crisis has raised questions about the robustness of computer systems at  other banks.","Worker recruited after 20,000 UK staff were made redundant .

"By . Wills Robinson . They had only been in their new enclosure for two weeks, but these polar bears were intent on making their presence known.

"By . Matt Cain . On the first day of my summer holiday I was standing outside a bar, drinking with friends. Everyone was laughing and joking, looking forward to a brilliant week in Spain. But something was wrong. And I knew what was going to happen. A fluttering in my stomach triggered a quickening heartbeat. I started overheating and sweating. Then a wave of anxiety swept through me, and I felt like I was drowning in white noise. As the attack reached its climax, I was overwhelmed by an urge to lie down. Matt Cain had fainting episodes and was undiagnosed for 30 years only to find out he had a faulty heartbeat . As ever, it was terrifying. But there was nothing I could do. The next thing I knew, I was waking up on the floor, surrounded by people panicking that I'd been unconscious for nearly 30 seconds. I sat up and reassured them there was nothing to worry about - this happened all the time. But I was rushed by ambulance to hospital, where they ran all kinds of tests to check I hadn't damaged my head as it hit the ground. I was fine - though too exhausted to care. I remained worn out for a few days and was left with such acute anxiety about another attack that my holiday was ruined. Since the age of seven, I'd fainted on countless occasions. And over three decades, coping with the condition - whatever it was - had become part of my life. There were periods when I'd faint a few times a year, but others when it would happen a few times a day. And although there were some triggers I'd learned to look out for - being tired, dehydrated, stressed, claustrophobic or too hot - an attack could occur at random. By the time I was working as the culture editor of Channel 4 News, I was so terrified of it happening when I was on camera that I took beta-blockers to manage my anxiety. They helped and I was fortunate not to have an attack on air. But I had no idea what was wrong. His condition is highly dangerous and he has now had fitted pacemaker . Then after that holiday in Spain, I was so fed-up with how my undiagnosed condition was affecting my life, I went to my GP and told him I needed an answer. Not that I hadn't already been offered several. A succession of specialists - NHS and private - had told me my attacks were down to adolescence, iron deficiency, slow heart rate, low blood pressure or even epilepsy. Others said my problem was purely psychological - an extreme form of panic attacks, which made me feel it was something I should be ashamed of. I spent thousands on hypnotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapy and psychotherapy - but none made any difference. By my mid-30s, I'd become dependent on beta-blockers and was taking the maximum dosage of anti-epilepsy drugs. I was so out of it I had no idea how often my attacks happened. My memory was decimated, my sex drive disappeared and my sparkle diminished. But one thing I was sure of - the problem was getting worse. And 30 years of living in fear of it had reduced me to a nervous wreck. Every area of my life had been contaminated: going to the hairdresser, eating out, trips to the cinema and theatre - not to mention first dates and job interviews. You name the situation, I've fainted in it. And the more I worked myself up in expectation of an attack, the more likely it was to happen. When the epilepsy diagnosis was overturned, since the drugs didn't work, I saw no alternative but to believe all those specialists who'd told me it was self-induced. When I went back to the GP after that holiday in 2012, I was at breaking point. At the first stirrings of an attack, I'd started wishing I wouldn't wake up afterwards. After so long without a satisfactory answer, I expected to be fobbed off. But I was referred to the National Hospital for Neurology in London for a 'tilt table test'. I lay on my back and was strapped to a table that was tilted forwards, suspending me head-first at 60 degrees. Electrodes were placed all over me and I was injected with a drug that made me lose consciousness for 20 seconds. This was done twice. For someone who'd spent his life in fear of such attacks it was the closest thing I could imagine to torture. Once it was over, as usual I was exhausted. The worst thing was, as I hadn't known what to expect and had travelled to the hospital alone, I had to be accompanied home by a nurse. I had reached my nadir. But the test finally gave me the answer. And my problem was definitely physical, not psychological. I have autonomically mediated syncope with asystole. Most doctors haven't even heard of it. It's difficult to say how many adults are affected, as symptoms can be similar to epilepsy, which explains why misdiagnosis is so common. But recent research by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Epilepsy shows that up to 30 per cent of adults diagnosed with epilepsy actually suffer from some form of syncope - where they faint or black out. This represents around 125,000 people in the UK. Autonomically mediated syncope is a problem with the 'automatic' nervous system, which allows different organs to communicate with each other. The pathways from my brain to my heart are defective, instructing my heart to shut down. This is commonly known as 'flat- lining', the near-death experience made into the film Flatliners, starring Julia Roberts. In my case, my heart rate races, drops sharply, cuts out completely  for about 20 seconds, then restarts. I lose consciousness because it interrupts the circulation of oxygenated blood to the brain.However, the brain has a mechanism to restart the heart, so there's no chance of it cutting out permanently - and even the most frequent attacks leave no permanent damage. The real risk is that you badly injure yourself as you fall. Mark has autonomically mediated syncope with asystole. Most doctors haven't even heard of it . I was referred to Dr Diana Holdright, a consultant cardiologist. She told me she'd met countless people like me, often after years of misdiagnosis. There was even a support group - STARS (Syncope Trust And Reflex-anoxic Seizures). I was tearful with relief. Soon afterwards, I was admitted to hospital to have a pacemaker fitted. Since then, whenever my heart rate has dropped, my pacemaker has kicked in to stop my heart from cutting out. So far, it hasn't let me down and I haven't fainted for nearly a year. I've been able to come off all medication, which has restored my energy and my memory. I finally feel like I've started living.But my story doesn't end there. A month after the operation, I returned to Dr Holdright for a check-up. I was told there was bad news - my pacemaker had kicked in 817 times in the first month, that's 817 times when previously I would have fainted. Mine was the worst case of autonomically mediated syncope she had ever seen. I didn't see the news as bad. For me it justified how worked up I'd been. I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred to a psychologist, who explained that after decades of living in my own metaphorical war zone, my body was in a constant state of high alert. I had to readjust to living without fear. I've now made that adjustment - and decided to give up my stressful job at Channel 4 to devote myself to my ultimate ambition, writing novels. The first, published this month, is a romantic comedy about a Hollywood actress who falls in love with a paparazzi photographer. The title? Shot Through The Heart. Most people can spot the double meaning, but only those who know what I've been through can spot the third. Matt Cain's novel Shot Through The Heart is published on April 24 by Pan Macmillan at £7.99.","The former culture editor of Channel 4 News has been fainting since he was seven .

"By . Becky Barrow . Thousands of letters are being dumped or delivered late by Royal Mail’s doorstep rival. Customers blame TNT Post for missed hospital appointments, lost bills and delayed medical test results. The company’s orange-clad staff are paid according to how quick they are – giving them an incentive to ditch mail. Letters have been found dumped in undergrowth in Manchester and London. Cache: Police officers found this pile of TNT mail in undergrowth in Sale, Manchester . Stash: Chris Elsdale came across 250 letters by a reservoir in Brent, London . TNT Post began its delivery operations in west London in April 2012 and has expanded into other parts of the capital as well as to Manchester and Liverpool. It hopes to reach 40 per cent of UK households within three years. Unlike Royal Mail, which must deliver 93 per cent of first-class letters on the next working day, TNT Post is not subject to strict rules laid down by the industry regulator Ofcom. One source said: ‘TNT Post can  literally do what it likes.’ Under fire: TNT Post began door-to-door deliveries two years ago . To add to the  chaos, people who find letters dumped or wrongly delivered by TNT Post typically put them into a Royal Mail postbox. Royal Mail will then levy a £1.53 surcharge – to the fury of recipients. Clare Yabsley, a mother of two from Hammersmith, west London, says she missed two important hospital letters because of failings by TNT Post. One related to her 20-month-old daughter Mia, who was born with a hole in her heart. The 48-year-old knew something was amiss only when a letter arrived from Chelsea & Westminster Hospital asking why she had not turned up to an appointment. She said: ‘When I phoned the hospital, which has been fantastic, they said it happens all the time. ‘It is such a waste of hospital appointments. If it has happened twice to me, how many other people has it happened to?’ On the other occasion a letter with medical test results failed to arrive with Mrs Yabsley having to rely on the copy later sent to her GP. Susan Hall, leader of Harrow Council, had to apologise to residents following delays by TNT Post in delivering council tax notices. It cost the London borough £13,000 to write to the 24,000 residents who had been affected by the payment date blunder. Salford City Council, which also uses TNT Post, had similar difficulties with a council tax mailout to 110,000 homes because of a problem with a franking machine. Chris Elsdale was walking her two dogs by the Welsh Harp Reservoir in Brent, north London, when she spotted a pile of around 250 letters under a bush. Over the next 12 days, she telephoned TNT Post repeatedly – about eight or nine times – to urge them to come and pick up the mail. But the pile of letters remained where she had first spotted them. She was told by one worker at TNT Post the bushes were too ‘thorny’ to tackle. She became so frustrated she went into the bushes herself, put all the letters into a bag and called TNT Post again to pick them up, which they did. Of the 250 items of mail, Mrs Elsdale said just ten were junk mail. The rest were from banks, energy companies, credit card providers and hospitals. Mrs Elsdale, 55, a director of a photography business, said: ‘Each and every letter had an effect on somebody’s life. ‘You can’t leave personal bank details lying under a bush for 12 days.’ She said she felt ‘very strongly’ that a company which is entrusted to handle the post must have ‘a policy and procedure that sorts out what has gone wrong in  24 hours’. TNT Post said it was ‘very grateful to Mrs Elsdale for working with us to get the issue resolved’. A Royal Mail postman from Manchester . said: ‘I constantly find mail sticking out of letter boxes and have to . post it through to enable me to deliver our mail behind it. I see items . of mail strewn in the street or thrown on doorsteps. ‘I see TNT postmen taking short cuts. I see them lost. I have them asking me directions and the whereabouts of certain streets. ‘All this astounds me and even saddens me as I have always taken pride in my own standards of service. ‘Worse still, there is the notion held by many of my customers that the decrease in service and standards is down to me.’ A TNT Post spokesman said: ‘We of course apologise for the disruption and distress caused by non-delivery of a letter by TNT Post. ‘However, sometimes human nature means that we cannot always live up to the standards we set ourselves and where there are issues with service quality, we will take the necessary action to resolve the issues to the satisfaction of our clients.’ Royal Mail lost its monopoly on all postal deliveries in January 2006. It quickly lost key business customers and now half of post is sorted by rival companies – before being delivered by Royal Mail on the so-called ‘final mile’. But that doorstep job is now also being done by TNT Post, meaning households can have two deliveries a day. TNT Post picks up letters from its client companies and sorts them before delivering them to their final destination. The company does not have its own post boxes. Royal Mail still has 115,500, which are most often used for social mail.","Thousands of letters being dumped or delivered late by TNT Post .

"By . Damien Gayle . 'Prisoner of conscience': Saudi blogger Raif Badawi, who is facing ten years jail, a thousand lashes and a million riyal fine (£133,000) for 'insulting Islam' A Saudi blogger is facing ten years jail, a thousand lashes and a million riyal fine for 'insulting Islam'. Raif . Badawi originally faced seven years jail and 600 lashes, but an appeal . court overturned that sentence and ordered a retrial. Amnesty . International has called the new sentence 'outrageous' and says Badawi . is a 'prisoner of conscience'. His website has been closed since his . first trial. Badawi . was arrested in June 2012 and charged with cyber crime and disobeying . his father - a crime in Saudi Arabia - in relation to his Saudi Liberal . Network website.. The site . included articles that were critical of senior religious figures such as . Saudi Arabia's Grand Mufti, according to Human Rights Watch. The prosecution had demanded that . Badawi be tried for apostasy, a crime which carries the death penalty in . Saudi Arabia, but his original trial judge dismissed that charge. Badawi's . lawyers have slammed yesterday's sentence as too harsh, althought the . prosecutor had asked for a harsher penalty, according to news website . Sabq. The ruling is subject . to appeal but, after his last appeal led to a stiffer penalty, and with . his original lawyer, human rights activist Waleed Abu al-Khair, . currently held in Riyadh's Malaz Prison on charges including 'breaking . allegiance with the king', Badawi may think twice about challenging the . latest ruling.

"By . Leesa Smith . A man with a rare condition which means his scrotum is so big he struggles to walk is appealing for money to help pay for lifesaving surgery in America. Tyrone Bowd, 24, from Willowbank in Queensland was diagnosed with scrotal lymphedema about 12 months ago. The agonising condition causes infections that cause his temperature to soar, his heart rate to increase and his body to turn septic. His mother Tanya Bowd said her son’s quality of life was declining as his scrotum was already the size of a watermelon - and was still growing. Tryone Bowd's watermelon-sized penis caused him to have an accident on his motorbike earlier this year . ‘As a mother the last 12 months have been emotional. I can’t sleep and I’m always doing research about how to help my son,’ she told the Courier Mail. ‘Some days I get to the point where I think we won’t get the help we need but as a mother I can’t stop. I’m 100 per cent committed to saving my son’s life.’ More... As happy pill prescriptions top 50million, even GP admits: We hand out too many antidepressants . Qld emergency depts best in country: govt . Ms Bowd said her son, who weighs 112kg who also has an inverted penis, had sought help from more than 100 medical professionals including doctors at Ipswich Hospital. ‘No one can help us in Australia,’ she said. ‘I had doctors discuss building a team to give surgery a go only to be told by a urologist that if I was to sign on the dotted line and allow anyone in Australia to operate I would be signing my son’s life away.’ Tyrone Bowd no longer has faith in Australian doctors after no one has been able to cure his scrotal lymphedema . She said her son no longer had any faith in doctors and was 'banging his head against a wall' in frustration that no one medical professional in Australia could help his heartbreaking situation. 'One response I got was they could give him a sex change but couldn’t repair his scrotum so I basically threw my hands in the air,' she said. 'A couple of doctors said they could build a team and give it a go and I said ""it’s not a game of cricket mate, he’s not a guinea pig"".' His family were left with no choice but to hold a car drive in Ipswich, Queensland, this Saturday to raise funds for Tyrone to fly to California to undergo lifesaving surgery performed by Dr Joel Geldman. Ms Bowd has been liaising with Dr Geldman who she said guaranteed that he and his medical team could perform an operation to save Tyrone’s life. Tyrone Bowd hopes to raise $100,000 to fly to California for lifesaving surgery to stop his ever-growing scrotum . Wesley Warren famously had his scrotal lymphedema corrected by Dr Geldman after going public on shock jock Howard Stern's radio show to talk about the plight of his 45kg scrotum. Mr Warren died in March after suffering two heart attacks when he was hospitalised due to complications from diabetes. Dr Geldman, stated in an email to Ms Bowd that he had performed the procedure 175 times. ‘I’ve contacted Dr Geldman and I have had continuous correspondence with him,’ she said. ‘He has been monitoring Tyrone’s condition via medical reports CT scans, ultrasounds and photographs.’ Mr Warren had never travelled to tropical areas and believed the condition was down to an accident in 2008, when he caught his testicles with his leg while twisting in bed. Ms Bowd said that maintaining a normal family life was difficult. 'Tyrone needs help to go to the toilet and he has a lot of difficulty walking. 'He broke his leg in a motorbike accident earlier this year and that’s because his scrotum was a hindrance on the bike,' she said. Tyrone and his dedicated mother, Tanya, who won't give up until her son has been cured of a heartbreaking condition . 'His scrotum is so big that he can’t ride a bike anymore and family and friends pitched in to get him a quad bike.' Ms Bowd said Tyrone had a heart of gold and rarely complained about the pain. 'He is always trying to make everyone he meets laugh, he loves fast cars, motor bikes, playing jokes, listening to music and spending time with people,' she said.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Kent might be known as the ‘Garden of England’ but one day parts of Wales, northern and south-west England could be home to underground ‘fields’ of corn and genetically modified crops. Scientists have discovered that lowering the temperature reduces the height of corn crops without affecting its seed yield. They think the crop could be grown in cool places such as caves and former mines in 'controlled-environment' facilities. Farm of the future? Scientists have discovered that lowering the temperature for two hours a day reduces the height of corn without affecting seed yield. They think the crop could be grown in cool places such as caves and former mines (pictured) in controlled-environment facilities . Researchers installed a growth chamber with insulation and yellow and blue high-intensity discharge lamps in a former limestone mine in Marengo, Indiana. Their aim was to test how corn would react to an environment in which its growing conditions - light, temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide - were tightly controlled. To reduce the corn's height, the researchers used a growth chamber that mimicked the temperature conditions and carbon dioxide levels of the mine. They dropped the temperature to 16°C (60°F) for the first two hours of each photoperiod - the time in which the corn received light. The temperature was restored to 27°C (80°F) for 14 hours and then lowered to 18°C (65 °F) for eight hours of darkness. The temperature dip dwarfed stalk height by 10 per cent and reduced stalk diameter by nine per cent without significantly affecting the number and weight of the seeds. Experts think this process could be easily achieved in caves and disused mines. Genetically-modified crops could also be . grown in such isolated environments as this would prevent genetically . modified pollen and seed from escaping into the ecosystem and crossing . with wild plants, experts claim. Cary Mitchell, professor of horticulture at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, believes that the technique could be useful for growing transgenic crops to produce high-value medicinal products such as antibodies. ‘Grains of corn could be engineered to produce proteins that could be extracted and processed into medicine, pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals such as essential vitamins,’ he said. ‘What we've done is show that you can successfully grow these high-value crops in contained environments.’ Professor Mitchell described corn as a ‘good candidate crop’ for the plant-derived pharmaceutical compounds industry. Location, location, location: Genetically-modified crops could be grown in the isolated environments as this would prevent genetically modified pollen and seed from escaping into the ecosystem and crossing with wild plants, experts Yang Yang (left) and Cary Mitchel (right) said . This is because the plant's plentiful seeds and well-characterised genome can be modified in many ways. Using plants as factories to generate bioactive medicines would be far cheaper than the current methods that rely on cell cultures from mammals, he said. In order to grow corn in dark and cool underground spaces, professor Mitchell and his researchers Yang Yang and Gioia Massa installed a growth chamber with insulation and yellow and blue high-intensity lamps in a former limestone mine in Marengo, Indiana. Their aim was to test how corn would react to an environment in which its growing conditions - light, temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide - were tightly controlled. But to their surprise, the hybrid corn responded by growing ‘too well,’ Dr Yang said. ‘We coddled the plants with such luxurious conditions that the corn was touching the lamps before it had even tasselled (produced pollen-producing flowers),’ he said. To reduce the corn's height, the researchers borrowed a trick used by the greenhouse industry to dwarf Christmas poinsettias. Using a . growth chamber that mimicked the temperature conditions and carbon . dioxide levels of the mine, they dropped the temperature to 16°C (60°F) for the first two hours of each photoperiod - the time in which the corn . received light. The temperature was restored to 27°C (80°F) for 14 hours and then lowered to 18°C (65 °F) for eight hours of darkness. Cream of the crop: In order to grow corn in dark and cool underground spaces the scientists installed a growth chamber with insulation and yellow and blue high-intensity discharge lamps in a former limestone mine in Marengo, Indiana. A stock image of a young corn crop is pictured . The temperature dip dwarfed stalk height by 10 per cent and reduced stalk diameter by nine per cent without significantly affecting the number and weight of the seeds. ‘This is a technique you could easily do in a mine or cave,’ Professor Mitchell said. ‘It is an affordable, non-chemical means of taking genetically modified crops to harvest maturity without getting any kind of pollen or seed into the ecosystem.’ He said that former mines could be prime locations to grow high-value, transgenic plants because their natural coolness lessens the need to ventilate the heat produced by lamps. The high levels of carbon dioxide in mines also promote plant growth. ‘Productivity in a controlled environment is superior to that in the field and you can raise more than one crop per year. ‘Controlled environment agriculture is going to be one of the big movements of the 21st century,’ he said. The experts think that caves and disused mines could prove an affordable, non-chemical means of taking genetically modified crops to harvest maturity without getting any kind of pollen or seed into the ecosystem. However, GM protestors (pictured tearing up plans in Oxfordshire) might disagree .","Scientists from Purdue University, Indiana, found lowering the temperature reduces the height of corn crops without affecting its seed yield .

"By . Ashley Collman . and Mark Prigg . A retired Marine with nearly two decades of aviation experience has stepped forward with a compelling theory about a mysterious plane that was spotted flying over Texas last month. On March 10, photographers Steve Douglass and Dean Muskett took pictures of three puzzling aircraft flying over Amarillo, and posted them online in hopes of identifying the planes. Retired-Marine James Vineyard has submitted one of the more interesting explanations, telling the Houston Chronicle he believes they are SR-72 Blackbirds - a spy plane that can cross the U.S. in less than an hour, unmanned. The triangle over Texas: Two photographers captured this mysterious object flying over Texas last month . Mystery solved? A retired Marine says the plane pictured in Amarillo last month is the SR-72 Blackbird - a plane designed to cross the country in less than an hour . The mystery aircraft  seen over Amarillo on March 10. Three of the craft were spotted flying by . In 1956, British magazines started . getting eyewitness accounts and grainy photos of the Lockheed U-2, then . operating out of RAF Lakenheath on its first spy flights over the Soviet . Union - marking the first sight of a stealth plane that government's . had hoped to keep secret from prying eyes. It provided day and night, very high-altitude (70,000 feet / 21,000 m), all-weather intelligence gathering. Vineyard spent 17 years as a Marine and also worked with a jet squadron in Arizona. He . says the Pentagon may have dispatched the planes to the Indian Ocean to . aide in the search for missing Malaysian Airlines flight 370. But Douglass, who saw the planes himself, doesn't agree. 'The . SR-72 is still in development,' he said Tuesday. 'Plus it's a . high-speed, high-Mach plane. These were going airliner speed. They were . not in a hurry to get anywhere.' The . SR-72 is currently being developed by Lockheed Martin in California, . and according to the company's website they say the plane could be . operational as early as 2030. It . is the predecessor of the SR-71 which broke speed records when it flew . from New York to Lonton in less than two hours in 1976. Lockheed . Martin's Hypersonics program manager Brad Leland wrote that the plane . is designed to 'strike at nearly any location across a continent in less . than an hour.' 'Speed is . the next aviation advancement to counter emerging threats in the next . several decades. The technology would be a game-changer in theater, . similar to how stealth is changing the battlespace today,' Leland said. Another source told the Chronicle that the plane was a B-2, but the two photographers discovered that no B-2s were flying in the country that day . The SR-72 is a successor to the SR-71 which broke speed records when it flew from New York to London in less than two hours in 1976 .

That's . what the photographers thought when they first saw the group of . aircraft, but they say they checked with the base and no B-2s were . flying anywhere in the U.S. that day. Instead, .

"By . Rebecca Camber . and Neil Sears . Police are chasing new leads in the Madeleine McCann case after being swamped by almost 1,000 tip-offs from the public. Detectives are working their way through 730 calls and 212 emails following the biggest ever response to an appeal on BBC Crimewatch. A number of callers gave names for the man police believe snatched Madeleine from her bed minutes before her mother Kate found she was missing. Scroll down for video . Fresh leads: British police are chasing new leads in the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann after being swamped by almost 1,000 tip-offs . Prime suspect: These e-fits are of the man seen carrying a child 500 . yards from the McCanns' holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal . 'Delighted': Kate and Gerry McCann said they were 'absolutely delighted' at the 'overwhelming' response following the Crimewatch appeal . Detectives believe a sighting of a man carrying a blonde girl 500 yards from the McCanns’ holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, is of ‘vital importance’. But the account of Irish holidaymakers who saw the suspect has been called into question because they originally said they were ‘60 to 80 per cent sure’ it was Madeleine’s father Gerry. Police have however said they are certain Mr McCann is not involved. Martin and Mary Smith gave police a signed statement when they returned home to Drogheda, County Louth. Response: After the couple's appeal on BBC Crimewatch(pictured), a number of callers gave names for the man police believe snatched Madeleine . Search: Madeleine's mother said she was 'genuinely hopeful' of a breakthrough . New timeline: The Crimewatch special revealed that police were now looking at Madeleine's abduction as being at 10pm and not 9.15pm . They said they had seen a man carrying a child toward Praia da Luz’s beach at 10pm on the night Madeleine disappeared – May 3, 2007. Metodo 3, a detective agency hired by the McCanns, produced two e-fits of the man in 2008 based on the Smiths’ account. Crimewatch's Madeline McCann . special was the most watched edition of the BBC show in its 29 year . history, attracting more than seven million viewers. The . hour long programme, which saw Scotland Yard reveal new findings, . peaked with 7.3 million, 30 per cent of the total audience share in the . five minutes from 9.25pm. The . show had an average of 6.7 million viewers, 27.4 per cent of the share, . adding almost three million viewers to the channel's slot average of . 3.9 million, nearly half the audience share enjoyed on Monday. A BBC spokeswoman said: 'It is the highest audience for a Crimewatch programme on record, going back to 2002.' The BBC does not have audience figures for Crimewatch, pre-dating that. It was first broadcast in 1984. Monday . night's Crimewatch was up against the popular ITV series Doc Marten . which drew an average audience of seven million. The previous series . high on March 31st, 2008, recorded 5.5 million (24 per cent). The ten . minute update at 10:35pm also attracted 3.3 million (22.5 per cent). BBC . head of communications Sam Hodges, responding to a criticism on Twitter . it was a 'ghastly ratings chaser', suggested the big audience was 'a . reflection of the public interest'. The images were made public this week when Scotland Yard revealed the mystery man is now the prime suspect. The detective leading the Metropolitan Police investigation is expected to travel to Ireland in the coming weeks. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said he was extremely pleased with the response to Monday night’s Crimewatch appeal. ‘We have now had over 730 calls and 212 emails as a direct result of the specific lines of inquiry we issued yesterday concerning events in the lead up to, and on the night of Thursday 3rd May 2007 when Madeleine was abducted,’ he said. ‘Detectives are now trawling through and prioritising that material. This will take time.’ Mr Redwood, who insists Mr McCann had nothing to do with his daughter’s disappearance, said two independent callers had put forward the same name for the suspect. Another caller gave the name of a man who was known to be in Portugal at the time of Madeleine’s disappearance. Mr Redwood said officers were waiting to ‘action the information’ and 40 people were ready to take further calls. With 6.7million viewers, the appeal attracted the biggest Crimewatch audience on record – almost double the average of 3.9 million. A BBC spokesman said it also had the highest number of calls ever received, more than double the usual number. The programme’s editor Joe Mather said: ‘Significantly, there were lots of calls from British people who were in Praia da Luz around the time of Madeleine’s disappearance who had never previously spoken to the Met, so there’s lots of information coming through there. ‘They received several names for the key 10pm sighting, the sighting of a man carrying a child toward the beach. ‘Several different names but also several callers mentioned the same name for that man.’ The Met is now taking the appeal to Holland where appeals were shown last night and a missing persons programme will be broadcast in Germany tonight. Investigators are keen to trace a number of fair-haired men seen lurking around the holiday apartments at the time who could be Dutch or German. Chilling: A scene from the Crimewatch reconstruction showing the moment Kate McCann discovers her daughter's empty bed . Reconstruction: Scenes from Crimewatch's reconstruction of the events that night in May . 2007, including the three-year-old actress who played Maddie, left . A reward of up to £20,000 is being offered for information leading to the identification, arrest and prosecution of those responsible for Madeleine’s abduction. Yesterday a spokesman for the McCanns said: ‘We are absolutely delighted with the overwhelming public response to Crimewatch. ‘We know that the public desperately want to help the search for Madeleine. We are genuinely hopeful that one or more of these responses will lead to a major breakthrough in the investigation.’ The new Crimewatch appeal focused on a claim by an Irish family that they saw a man carrying a child through Praia da Luz at around the time Madeleine McCann was found to be missing. Two differing e-fits of the suspect were issued, and police say it is possible the family did see the three-year-old being spirited away by her abductor. Key witness: Irishman Martin Smith, pictured, . was in the resort with his family when Maddie disappeared . The sighting came when Martin Smith, a retired businessman in his 70s, was walking back to his apartment in the Algarve resort following a meal and drinks at a bar with his wife and children. At a spot a six-minute walk from the McCanns’ holiday accommodation, they saw a man carrying a blonde child aged around four. It was just before 10pm and the street lighting was poor. Although Mr Smith admitted he was not wearing his glasses at the time he later said he thought the man could have been Gerry McCann. This is an impossibility as dozens of witnesses confirmed he was at the holiday complex at 10pm. British police have also said they are certain that Mr McCann has nothing to do with his daughter’s appearance. Speaking to Portuguese police a few weeks after Maddie disappeared, Mr Smith said it was ‘not possible to recognise the individual’. His grandchildren were also unable to identify the man or the girl – but thought she could have been Madeleine. Yet in September 2007 Mr Smith suddenly called police again to say he believed the man he saw could have been Gerry McCann. He had been watching television coverage of the family returning to Britain. However numerous witnesses say they were with Mr McCann at the tapas restaurant at the time in question – so he could not possibly have been 500 yards away. This has led to Mr Smith’s account being called into question. The retired businessman from County Louth, Ireland, was staying in Praia da Luz with his wife Mary, now 65, his son Peter and his wife and their children. He part owned an apartment in the resort and visited it three times a year.","Kate and Gerry McCann said they were 'absolutely delighted' at response .

"By . Tara Brady . The woman who told police a student was planning to meet a couple at their apartment before she was allegedly strangled during a sadomasochistic threesome has taken to the witness stand. Seth Mazzaglia, 31, of Dover, is accused of raping and killing a 19-year-old college student Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott on October 9, 2012. He maintains she died during rough consensual sex. Marriott, of Westborough, Massachusetts, was a student at the University of New Hampshire and was lured to Mazzaglia's apartment by his then-girlfriend, Kathryn McDonough, it is claimed. Scroll down for video . Victim: Police say Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott (left and right), the 19-year-old killed during an attempted sexual assault on October 9 in Dover, New Hampshire, was the victim of a violent strip poker threesome . Shocked: Lizzi Marriott's family has railed at that notion she died during consensual sex with Mazzaglia . Prosecutors claim that Mazzaglia . choked Marriott from behind with a rope while she sat on a couch in his . apartment on Mill Street in Dover. Assistant . Attorney General Peter Hinckley told the jury on Wednesday that after . Marriott could no longer object to Mazzaglia's sexual advances because . of the choking, he pushed her underwear out of the way and raped her . while McDonough, 19, did nothing to help. Hinckley portrayed Mazzaglia as a bondage, domination and sadomasochism 'master' who treated McDonough as a 'submissive slave.' Suspect: Seth Mazzaglia (left and right) of Dover, who is . a struggling actor has been arrested and charged with the murder of . missing student Lizzi Marriott . He also said Mazzaglia ordered McDonough to find him another woman to dominate in a sexual way before meeting Marriott. The couple even posted ads online looking for a sexual slave to do light housework, it was alleged. Yesterday Brittany Atwood, 26, described as Marriott's first girlfriend, took to the witness stand. Atwood . told Hinckley that she became good friends with Marriott in January . 2012 and they became romantically involved in February or March. They met while working at a Stop and Shop in Massachusetts. She described Marriott as beautiful, kindheated, caring, trusting, goofy, silly and experimental. Atwood . said the last message she received from Marriott was at 8.55pm on the . night she was allegedly murdered. It said: 'You're so cute!' Accomplice: Kathryn McDonough, 19, is charged with lying to authorities regarding the death of Lizzie Marriot . Atwood said she then sent Marriott two text messages - one at 8.59pm and one at 9.06pm but Marriott never responded. Atwood said became worried the next morning when she had not heard from Marriott and contacted her parents. After the police were contacted, Atwood told them Marriott was planning to meet McDonagh after her chemistry lab class. However, during cross examination, public defender Melissa Davis asked Atwood if Marriott was also into 'fantasy type stuff'. According to Atwood, Marriott like anime and video games like World of Warcraft. She was also into Game of Thrones. 'She was also experimental, so if she wanted to try something, she was going to try it,' Davis said. Charged: Kathryn McDonough, 19, seen at her arraignment (left) and arrest (right) was charged with lying to the police about her whereabouts on the night that a supposed friend went missing . She also asked Atwood whether she had been told Marriott was playing strip poker with McDonoughand Mazzaglia. 'You did not get a text message that strip poker was being played?' Davis asked. 'No,' Atwood said. 'You did not know that she was playing strip poker?' Davis asked. 'No,' Atwood said. 'You didn't know she was playing strip poker that night until much later,' Davis said. 'I didn't know at all,' Atwood said. Recently released court documents describe the couple's interviews with police starting three days after Marriott disappeared. First . Mazzaglia said Marriott had never made it to their place that night — . he had gone out for a run, hurt his ankle and was slow returning to the . house. McDonough told police she went to a nearby cemetery in hopes of capturing images of ghosts with her digital camera. Mystery: A Portsmouth fire boat searches the Piscataqua River in New Hampshire for the body of student Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott. No body was ever found . But Mazzaglia's story soon began to change. In an interview later the same day, he talked of bondage and sadomasochism. He . implicated McDonough and another couple in harming Marriott, saying . when he arrived home Marriott had a ligature mark around her neck. He suggested another man had done something terrible, but he wouldn't say what. Finally, . police said, Mazzaglia admitted he was involved. He and McDonough were . playing strip poker with Marriott and that led to intercourse. Mazzaglia said he was having sex with Marriott — and tightening a rope around her neck — when she had a 'seizure.' Mazzaglia told investigators neither he nor McDonough tried to revive Marriott or summon help. Instead, he told them, he put a grocery bag over her head and tied it at the neck. Mazzaglia . told investigators he and McDonough used Marriott's 2001 Mazda to take . her body to Peirce Island in Portsmouth, where they threw it and her . cellphone into the Piscataqua River. When . Marriott's torso remained above water, he said, McDonough went into the . water and pushed it under, making a joke about 'Davy Jones' locker.' The . pair then drove Marriott's car to UNH, left it in a student lot and . discarded her belongings in trash bins, authorities allege. Mazzaglia . was arrested October 13 — a day after he was interviewed — and . McDonough on Christmas Eve. He is being held without bond, charged with . first-degree murder. She has been indicted on charges of conspiracy and hindering prosecution. She was released on $35,000 bond on the condition she live with her parents in Portsmouth. Family members describe Marriott as 'gullible' - someone who easily could be taken advantage of because of her trusting nature. One family friend from Westborough, Mass., where Marriott grew up, called her naive. 'She . was just a good girl. That's probably what got her in trouble,' Dawn . Downey said. 'She was too trusting and she was beautiful. Those two . things will kill you.'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The British government is under pressure to answer claims it allowed the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia to be used to hold Al Qaeda suspects in a secret jail. A leaked report in the US suggests the CIA held ‘high value’ detainees on the British territory with the ‘full co-operation’ of the UK government. The claims contradict repeated denials that Britain had ever let the US use Diego Garcia for the ‘extraordinary rendition’ of terror suspects. The British territory of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean was used to hold 'high value' terror suspects in a secret black jail, according to reports in the US . A report by a Senate Intelligence Committee into the CIA’s kidnap and torture is due to be published in weeks. But sources told Al Jazeera America it includes claims that Britain was aware of the use of Diego Garcia as a secret ‘black jail’. US President George W Bush confirmed in 2006 that the CIA had operated a network of secret prisons around the world to interrogate terror suspects. The Senate report claims that ‘the CIA detained some high-value suspects on Diego Garcia, an Indian Ocean island controlled by the United Kingdom and leased to the United States’, Al Jazeera America reported. ‘The classified CIA documents say the black site arrangement at Diego Garcia was made with the “full cooperation” of the British government.’ Foreign Secretary William Hague is under pressure to answer questions raised by the reports . In 2011 ministers denied Diesgo Garcia had been used in this way. Foreign Office minister David Lidington said: Aside from the two cases of rendition through Diego Garcia in 2002, the US Government has confirmed that there have been no other instances in which US intelligence flights landed in the UK, our Overseas Territories, or the Crown Dependencies, with a detainee, on board since 11 September 2001.’ However, Mr Hague now faces pressure to address the claims which have emerged from the Senate Committee report. Reprieve, a legal charity which represents victims of rendition, has written to Mr Hague demanding an explanation. Reprieve strategic director, Cori Crider said: ‘We need to know immediately whether ministers misled Parliament over CIA torture on British soil. ‘If the CIA operated a black site on Diego Garcia, then a string of official statements, from both this and the last government, were totally false. ‘Were ministers asleep at the wheel? Or, as the report suggests, have we been lied to for years? ‘The Foreign Secretary must urgently clarify whether the CIA ran a secret prison on Diego Garcia, and whether our clients Abdel-Hakim Belhaj and his wife Fatima Boudchar were among its victims.’ A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘I refer you to statements we’ve made in the past on this issue.’","Leaked Senate Committee report says UK knew about CIA 'black jail'

A Massachusetts man who knew the brothers suspected of carrying out the Boston Marathon bombings was charged on Friday with obstructing the investigation into the deadly bombings. Khairullozhon Matanov, 23, of Quincy, destroyed, altered and falsified records in a federal investigation, and made false statements in a federal investigation, federal prosecutors said. Matanov, a legal resident of the U.S. originally from Kyrgyzstan, is not accused of participating in the bombings or of knowing about them in advance. Khairullozhon Matanov, 23, of Quincy, Massachusetts, and friend of Tamerlan, right, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, left, is accused of destroying, altering and falsifying records in a federal investigation . He is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court in Boston on Friday afternoon. Matanov knew Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and in the days after the April 2013 bombings that killed three people and injured more than 260, Matanov realized the FBI would want to talk with him because he shared their 'philosophical justification for violence,' prosecutors said. He talked to the brothers on numerous occasions after the bombings, and even took them out to dinner the day of the explosions, they said. 'In the days following the bombings, Matanov continued to express support for the bombings, although later that week he said that maybe the bombings were wrong,' the indictment said. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, left, has pleaded not guilty to several federal charges and is awaiting trial, while Tamerlan Tsarnaev, right, was killed during a gunbattle with police four days after the bombings . Forensic: Investigators survey the site of a bomb blast on Boylston Street a day after two explosions hit the Boston Marathon in Boston, Massachusetts on April 16, 2013 . He tried to contact the brothers after he saw media reports identifying them as the suspects, prosecutors said. Matanov deleted information regarding the brothers from his computer, including internet searches, they said. He also allegedly asked a friend to destroy his cellphones, but that friend refused. And he repeatedly lied to investigators about the extent of his friendship with the Tsarnaev brothers, prosecutors said. The brothers, ethnic Chechens who lived in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and the Dagestan region of Russia, settled in the United States more than a decade ago.

"By . Paul Donnelley . Nicholas T. Sheley had already killed two men when he murdered four people including a two-year-old boy . Petty criminal Nicholas Sheley was yesterday found guilty of four murders. Sheley was convicted of the killings of his wife's ex-boyfriend Brock Branson, . his fiancée Kilynna Lee Blake, a month after her 20th birthday, and her . two-year-old son, Dayan Kurtis and their flatmate. Sheley had never got over the fact that his wife, Holly Gaul Shieley, had dated Mr Branson  and he went to the flat they shared with a hammer in his hand. Their flatmate Kenneth Ulve, 25, was there alone, and Sheley killed him with a hammer. He then waited for Mr Branson, Miss Blake and Dayan, to come home whereupon he murdered them . all with the hammer as revealed by a post mortem examination. Sheley is already serving life sentences for the murders of 93-year-old Russell Reed and 65-year-old Ronald Randall. Sheley killed Mr Reed on June 23, 2008 as he searched for money to buy cocaine and then hid his body in the boot of his car in Sterling, just across the Rock River about 110 miles west of Chicago, Illinois. Five days later, he murdered Mr Randall and stole his truck. Two days later on June 30, Sheley went to the northwest Illinois home of 29-year-old Brock Branson. Mr Branson had had an affair with Sheley's wife Holly Gaul Sheley before her marriage to Sheley and could not come to terms with it. Sheley . was arrested on July 1, 2008 in a bar in Granite City, Illinois; earlier that . day he had been to see a St Louis Cardinals baseball match. Victims: Brock Branson, his fiancée Kilynna Blake and her son Dayan, two. Sheley believed that Mr Branson was seeing his estranged wife, Holly, and decided to exact his revenge. Miss Blake and Dayan were in the wrong place at the wrong time . The prosecution's case focused heavily on Sheley's DNA, which experts said was found in the apartment. Prosecutors also showed images of Sheley taken from security cameras in the days following the killings in which he wore clothing belonging to one of the victims. After killing Mr Randall, Sheley went to see his estranged wife, Holly, at a friend's house and they went for a ride in the stolen truck. At the trial Mrs Sheley testified: 'I felt like my butt was getting a little cold or a little wet. When we came underneath a street lamp, I had blood all over my hands. I started freaking out, but he just kept on driving.' They stopped by a Holiday Inn in Rock Falls where Mrs Shelley used to work and took a walk by a nearby canal where, to ‘keep the peace’, she agreed to have sex. Holly Sheley did not volunteer this information to police until her DNA was found on cigarettes in the truck a year later. She claimed that she was scared and was offered immunity for her testimony.Steve Nate, Assistant Attorney General said, ‘[Mr Branson] walked in that door and the defendant ambushed them, he hits them on the head and they go down on their hands and knees. They're on their hands and knees as the defendant is beating them over, and over. ‘Nicholas Sheley did this. Nicholas Sheley is the one responsible for these murders,’ Assistant Attorney General Nate said during his final argument. ‘Nicholas Sheley killed Brock. He killed Kye. He killed Dayan. And he killed Kenny.’ Jodi Fitzgerald, the sister of Brock Branson, celebrates as the verdict. 'I hope you rot in hell, Nick Sheley,' she screamed as Sheley was led from the courtroom . Sheley rocked back and forth in his chair as Judge Jeffrey O’Connor read the verdicts. Family members of the victims sobbed, wiped away tears and exchanged hugs to the judge's words. ‘I hope you rot in hell, Nick Sheley,’ Jodi Fitzgerald, the sister of Brock Branson, screamed as Sheley was led from the courtroom. Sentencing in the Rock Falls killings is set for 11am on August 11. Illinois does not have the death penalty. He next faces trial in the deaths of Jill and Tom Estes, a Sherwood, Arkansas, couple who were traveling in Missouri, where prosecutors can pursue the death penalty. Nick Sheley was arrested at Bindy's Bar & Grill in Granite City, Illinois, on July 1, 2008 - the day after he committed four murders . 93-year-old Russell Reed whose body was found on June 26, 2008, stuffed in the boot of a car after Nicholas T.

"By . Francesca Chambers . Hillary Clinton's upcoming book Hard Choices contains a detailed chapter on the September 11, 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Politico has learned. In the 34-page chapter of the book, which Politico obtained ahead of the book's June 10 release date, the former secretary of state writes that the death of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, was 'a punch in the gut' and  'a crushing blow' but maintains that she did nothing wrong. Republicans are doing a disservice to the Americans who died in the attack by continuing to assassinate her character, Clinton suggests. 'Those who exploit this tragedy over and over as a political tool minimize the sacrifice of those who served our country,' she writes. 'I will not be a part of a political slugfest on the backs of dead Americans. It’s just plain wrong, and it’s unworthy of our great country. Those who insist on politicizing the tragedy will have to do so without me.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A chapter from Hillary Clinton's upcoming book was leaked to press. In it, she defends the Obama administration's response to the terrorist attack in Benghazi on September 11, 2012 . In the chapter Clinton rehashes the White House and State Department's response to the turmoil in Benghazi both before and after the terrorist attack. In one passage Clinton makes the case that the much talked about anti-Muslim video was 'indeed a factor' in the attack on the Benghazi consulate. 'There were scores of attackers that night, almost certainly with differing motives,' she writes. 'It is inaccurate to state that every single one of them was influenced by this hateful video. It is equally inaccurate to state that none of them were. Both assertions defy not only the evidence but logic as well.' Clinton maintains that what U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice told Americans about the video on news shows was the best information available at the time. Rice simply espoused the talking points created by the CIA for members of Congress, Clinton says, repeating prior claims. 'Susan stated what the intelligence community believed, rightly or wrongly, at the time,' Clinton says. 'That was the best she or anyone could do. Every step of the way, whenever something new was learned, it was quickly shared with Congress and the American people.' 'There is a difference between getting something wrong, and committing wrong. A big difference that some have blurred to the point of casting those who made a mistake as intentionally deceitful,' she continues. The former secretary of state also sheds light on how Rice ended up on the Sunday morning news shows in the first place. To political observers, it seemed odd at the time that the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations was designated by the White House to go on the shows instead of a senior or cabinet level official. Clinton says in the book she didn't do it because it wasn't her job to represent the administration on talk shows. There are those who 'fixate on the question of why I didn’t go on TV that morning, as if appearing on a talk show is the equivalent of jury duty, where one has to have a compelling reason to get out of it.' Clinton writes, 'I don’t see appearing on Sunday-morning television as any more of a responsibility than appearing on late-night TV.' 'Only in Washington is the definition of talking to Americans confined to 9 A.M. on Sunday mornings.' Clinton, a more stern and serious politician than she was during her husband's presidency, is positioning herself for a White House run of her own kn 2016 . It also wasn't her job to read the cables being transmitted to State from personnel on the ground warning of growing security threats even though they are addressed to her, Clinton notes. 'That’s not how it works. It shouldn’t. And it didn’t.' Clinton reiterates in the book that her name was only on the diplomatic cables because of a 'procedural quirk,' and that's why she never saw the cables from Stevens leading up to the attack in which he relayed the commander of Benghazi's Supreme Security Council's concerns that police and security forces were not equipped to handle unrest in the area. Republican groups have made quick work of tearing down Clinton's claims. 'Clinton’s claim not only that she wasn’t aware of security requests, but . actually shouldn’t have been bothered with them, is nothing short of . appalling,' America Rising PAC, a Republican opposition research outfit, wrote in a blog post on its website this morning. 'Clinton also seems to be one of the last people who still believe that the attack was fueled by an anti-Islam video.' In a research briefing 'Fact Checking Hillary Clinton's Benghazi Narrative,' The Republican National Committee points to testimony from former Deputy Chief of Mission Greg Hicks, who was one of  the highest-ranking officials in Libya at the time, that the attack was not the result of a spontaneous protest to to the distasteful YouTube video. A year ago Hicks told officials from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, 'I think everybody in the mission thought it was a terrorist attack from the beginning.' Trouble in paradise: Clinton's June 2 speech at a huge concert arena in Colorado has been a hard sell for political supporters, causing LivingSocial to offer tickets for 1/3 the original pice . The rest of Clinton's memoir will be released next month, but no other chapter is likely to draw as much attention as the one that was leaked today. The Benghazi section was reportedly being circulated among influential Democrats so they could familiarize themselves with Clinton's claims before next month's release. Politico's sources also say that  former National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor is helping Clinton with the roll out. Vietor, who no longer works for the Obama administration in any capacity, notably told Fox News earlier this month that he doesn't 'really remember' what changes he did or did not make to Rice's talking points in his capacity as NSC spokesman. 'Dude, this was like two years ago,' he said. Politico tried to get Clinton's spokesman, Nick Merrill, to provide further insight into Clinton's defense strategy, but he declined to comment on her thinking. 'Until the book is released, there’s nothing to say. And once it’s released, it will speak for itself,' he said.","'Those who exploit this tragedy over and over as a political tool minimize the sacrifice of those who served our country,' she writes in a new memoir .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Not-so average Joe: Joe Cornell, 52, a homeless recovering meth addict, returned a bag filled with $125,000 in cash after it fell off an armored truck . Joe Cornell, a recovering meth addict living in a Salvation Army rehab center, only had a $1 to his name Wednesday when he came upon a bag of money that fell off an armored truck. Instead of pocketing the $125,000 that Cornell, of Fresno, California, discovered when he opened the package, the down-on-his luck homeless man did the right thing - and returned all of it. A day later, Cornell was handsomely rewarded for his honesty when the security company Brinks, whose truck was transporting the misplaced money, gave the homeless man a debit card with $5,000 on it. 'Mr. Cornell did the right thing,' Brinks spokesman Ed Cunningham told The Fresno Bee. 'For that, we are grateful.' Cornell, 52, a married father of two with four grandchildren, has been staying at a Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Center in Fresno while trying to kick his crystal meth habit. On Wednesday morning, Cornell was watering plants in the yard when he witnessed a Brinks armored vehicle pull over at a red light on Venture Avenue nearby. Scroll down for video . Windfall: The pile of deposit money tumbled off a Brinks vehicle (similar to the one pictured) Struggling with demons: Cornell, 52, has been staying at a Fresno Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Center for the past four months while trying to kick a meth habit . Cornell overheard a motorist yell something to the driver of the Brinks truck, but the vehicle took off. The homeless grandfather walked over to the intersection for a closer look, and that is when he found a deposit bag stuffed with cash, the station KMPH reported. Even though Cornell had just a single dollar bill in his pocket for lunch that day, his first thought was that the pile of cash that fell into his lap likely belonged to businesses, and that keeping it could hurt innocent workers and their families. Cornell also had his grandchildren on his mind when he made the decision not to give in to temptation. ‘I thought, “What type of man do I want my grandkids to think I am?”’ Cornell told KMPH. ‘I want them to think I’m a just man that does the right thing and I did the right thing.’ The Salvation Army volunteer then alerted his supervisor, rehab program director Kayo Loveless, that he had found a small fortune and wanted to return it. ‘I went down there carrying the bag like I was Santa Claus,’ Cornell recalled. ‘It was heavy.’ When Cornell told his wife, Virginia, about what happened, the woman wept because she was so proud of her husband. The family plan to use Mr Cornell’s $5,000 reward from Brinks to pay off their debts. 'This is like a new start for us,' Mrs Cornell said. Honesty rewarded: Cornell (left) was given $5,000 by Brinks for returning the money; his wife, Virginia Cornell (right), says they will use the reward money to pay off their debts . Fresh start: The married couple, who have two children and four grandchildren, are looking forward to moving back together after Cornell's graduation from the Salvation Army program . Since the story broke earlier this week, people have been stopping by the shelter to give Cornell donations - or simply shake his hand. The security company also donated $5,000 to the rehabilitation center where Cornell has been staying for the past four months. Joe Cornell is expected to graduate from the Salvation Army program in July. He said that he is now clean and is looking for a job. ‘Anyone that needs an honest man to hire, we know that he's an honest man,’ said his wife. ‘He just gave back $125,000 that wasn't his.’ KMPH FOX 26 | Central San Joaquin Valley News Source .","Joe Cornell, 52, found bag full of cash that fell off a Brinks truck while staying at Salvation Army rehab center in Fresno, California .

"By . Simon Jones . Manager Brian McDermott has left Championship side Leeds United by mutual consent. The former Reading boss had been in charge since April 2013, having signed a three-year contract. McDermott helped keep the club in the Championship last season, during which time they were taken over by Italian businessman Massimo Cellino. Exit: Brian McDermott has left Leeds United by mutual consent . Strugglers: Leeds eventually finished 15th in the Championship . McDermott's future at Elland Road had looked increasingly uncertain following Massimo Cellino's takeover of the Yorkshire club earlier this year. In a statement, Cellino said: 'Brian is a great manager and a great guy. He has been unfortunate to work in such difficult circumstances. 'I did not fully understand the mess he had to work in, and the broken promises he had to deal with, until I have got involved trying to turn Leeds around. 'He has been a gentleman to deal with in our discussions and has been very understanding of my wish to implement a new structure. His main concern and priority at all times has been the welfare and protection of Leeds United. 'I wish him well for the future where I am sure he will continue to have more success and thank him for his efforts in being a stabilising and unifying figure behind the scenes in very difficult circumstances. Uncertain: Since Cellino's arrival, McDermott's position has seemed increasingly under threat . 'His honest efforts to guide us to the safety of mid-table when faced with many difficulties is appreciated by us all. He will always be a friend of Leeds United.' In the same statement, McDermott said: 'It has been my great privilege to manage this great club and I have enjoyed the challenge immensely. 'However it is clear that Massimo wishes to implement a new structure and feels he will work more successfully for Leeds with a coach rather than a manager. 'I respect that Massimo must be fully supported in putting together his vision for the club so he can bring us the success we all want. It is my belief that when truly United we are stronger. 'Massimo wants to bring a new energy to the club so that we can return to where we belong as a healthy football club. Goodbyes: McDermott said 'thank you' to players and staff on the club's website . 'To my players for their efforts I say a big thank-you. To all the staff and especially my great assistant manager Nigel Gibbs and my great friend Patrick Dolan I am especially grateful for their support. 'Finally to the incredible force that is the Leeds United supporters, I offer my heartfelt thanks. 'Your support of me and the players was always an inspiration and I urge everyone to get behind the team and the new owner next season to get us back to where we need to be, fighting for trophies and competing at the top-table of English and European football. 'It won't be easy, but Marching On Together we can get there. 'I wish Massimo and all my friends at Elland Road every success in the future.'

"By . Steph Cockroft . As he skillfully controls the ball in front of an expectant crowd, Gabriel Muniz looks like any other footballer his age. But unlike his teammates, the 13-year-old from Campos dos Goytacazes, Brazil, was born without any feet. Now Gabriel - who started playing football when he was eight - has been chosen to showcase his skills at an event in Hong Kong, to promote next month's World Cup in Brazil. Unique player: Football star Gabriel Muniz, from Campos dos Goytacazes, Brazil, was born with limb deficiency apodia, which meant his feet did not develop .

World Cup . The teenager showed off his solo skills at a shopping centre and will also play in a three-a-side match later this week, as part of the run-up to the global tournament. Gabriel was born with a limb deficiency called apodia, which meant his feet did not develop. But the young boy was so determined to walk that he took his first steps when he was around ten months old. Soon, the budding footballer was kicking a ball around, joining the local football team at his school and even winning medals, according to his mother Sandra. Now, Gabriel wears prosthetic limbs most days, but he goes without them during a game. Gabriel's skills were deemed to be so impressive that he also caught the eye of FC Barcelona in 2012 - and was invited along to a training camp to play against abled-bodied footballers.

That came following a trial at the football club's training academy in Saquarema, Rio de Janeiro. Last year, a TV series followed the story of Gabriel's perseverance and saw him meeting his footballing hero Lionel Messi, the Argentine superstar. In a previous interview, his mother said: 'He started walking before he was one. We would go after him, expecting him to keep falling, but he never fell.' Gabriel's gym teacher Jose Lopes added: 'He is challenging the social norms. When he arrived there [at the Barcelona academy], no-one believed in him. 'But he proved to everyone there he can go head to head with any other boy.

"By . John Drayton . Cristiano Ronaldo missed training on Friday and will sit out Saturday's friendly against Greece after complaining of muscular pain in his left thigh, coach Paulo Bento said on Friday. Bento did not think there was any risk of Ronaldo missing Portugal's opening World Cup match against Germany, but added that he had to 'consider every scenario.' Ronaldo joined the Portugal squad on Thursday along with Real Madrid team mates Pepe and Fabio Coentrao and has yet to leave the team hotel in Obidos. Missing out: Cristiano Ronaldo will not play for Portugal against Greece after missing training on Friday . Portugal said in a statement he spent Friday doing rehabilitation work in the hotel because of pain in his left thigh. 'He will be with us but he will not compete,' Bento told reporters, adding that Pepe would also be rested. Bento was asked if there was any risk of Ronaldo missing the Germany match in Salvador on June 16. 'I don't think so but I have to consider every scenario,' he said. 'What I don't want to do is put any sort of pressure on a player that causes them to compete when they are not in a the right state to do so. 'We're not setting any deadlines,' he added. 'The player's well-being comes first. I want him to be in the best possible form without running any risks. 'We must have a team that compete with the players who are usually the first choices and can compete with players who maybe aren't among the first choices,' he said.

The perfect 10: Cristiano Ronaldo holds both hands up in a hot tub to signify Real Madrid's 'La Decima' Bento dismissed the suggestion that Ronaldo's presence put Portugal among the World Cup favourites. 'The fact that we have the best player in the way doesn't make it an obligation for us to be world champions,' he said. 'Our first target is to get to the round of 16.' Ghana and United States are Portugal's other group-stage opponents.","Cristiano Ronaldo will miss Portugal's friendly with Greece on Saturday .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . A man who lived on the lam under an assumed identity for decades after the brutal 1975 murders of two suburban Detroit brothers was sentenced Friday to eight years to 15 years in prison. David Fowler's 39 years of looking over his shoulder ended when DNA from a 2012 arrest in Georgia led to his extradition to Michigan and Friday sentencing. Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Richard Skutt surprisingly announced he would stick to the sentencing agreement attached to Fowler's earlier no-contest plea to manslaughter despite him skipping town. Facing the music: David Fowler during a recent Michigan court appearance where he pleaded no contest to manslaughter, he was sentenced Friday to eight to 15 years in prison . A brother, daughter and niece of his victims, Michael and Jeffrey Belt, had wanted more prison time for Fowler, but the judge stuck to his guns. 'It was heinous. It was worse than brutal,' Elwood Belt said after the sentencing about the attack that led to his brothers' deaths. Michael Belt, 34, and his 18-year-old brother, Jeffrey, were beaten with a board and stabbed during a robbery at Michael Belt's home in Livonia, west of Detroit. Two other men were charged and convicted in the slayings, but Fowler fled Michigan and spent 37 years on the run until his 2012 arrest in Georgia on a theft charge. A subsequent DNA test linked him to the Michigan deaths and he was shipped north to face the music. He had already been in prison under the alias Richard Taylor, according to WDIV. He was also arrested in Georgia in 1999 on a soplifting charge as well, records showed. Through the years: David Fowler shown at left in a 1997 mug shot and right in a 2010 booking photo, he was arrested both times in Georgia . When asked Friday by Skutt if he had anything to say before being sentenced, Fowler replied: 'I'll just stand on the sentence agreement.' A first-degree murder charge in the 1975 slayings was dismissed when the no-contest plea was made earlier this month. A no-contest plea isn't an admission of guilt but is treated as such for sentencing. Defense attorney Leon Weiss told the court that the 'agreement reached was fair and just' and reflected the evidence available after more than three decades. Prosecutors and police had trouble locating witnesses and getting reluctant witnesses to come forward, Skutt said. 'A lot of people's memories and information that was fresh in 1975 was not there,' the judge said. Fowler and the other two men had been close friends with Jeffrey Belt, Elwood Belt said. 'They all went to school together, lived in the same neighborhood,' Elwood Belt said. 'They visited my parents' house together.' But Julie Blackwood, a niece of the brothers, told the judge in a statement that once released, Fowler will 'only cause more pain. 'It sickens me that this man will only spend eight to 15 years in prison for the murder of two men,' said Blackwood, who was aged 2 at the time of the slayings.","David Fowler was implicated by Michigan authorities in the 1975 slaying of the pair .

"By . Richard Spillett . Missing: Rui Li, 44, was last seen leaving Poole . Hospital in Dorset, on the evening of last Friday and was reported . missing four days later . Detectives investigating the disappearance of a nurse a week ago have arrested a second man on suspicion of murder. Rui Li, 44, was last seen leaving Poole Hospital in Dorset, on the evening of last Friday and was reported missing to police by her family four days later. On Wednesday, police arrested a 60-year-old Bournemouth man on suspicion of murder and he remains in custody after detectives were granted further time to question him. Now a 26-year-old Bournemouth man, who is also known to Ms Li, has been arrested on suspicion of murdering the nurse. Extensive investigations are going on, with forensic experts examining three addresses at Burnham Drive, Wolverton Road and St Clement’s Road, all in Boscombe, Dorset. Ms Li’s distinctive Porsche Boxster, with personalised number plate L1 RUI, was found outside a property in Wolverton Road. Police have released CCTV of the last known sighting of Ms Li, which shows her leaving the car park at the hospital at 6.17pm last Friday. Detectives said she moved to the UK from China a decade ago and has worked at Poole Hospital since 2009. They said Ms Li, who has a teenage daughter, led 'a private personal life' and officers were trying to build a picture of her lifestyle. A Dorset Police spokesman said: 'A 26-year-old Bournemouth man, also known to Ms Li, has been arrested on suspicion of murder. He is currently being questioned by detectives. 'Detectives have also been granted additional time to question the arrested 60-year-old Bournemouth man.' Detective . Inspector Marcus Hester, who is leading the inquiry, said yesterday: 'It . is still absolutely crucial for the investigation to establish . what has happened to Ms Li between Friday evening and Tuesday morning. 'I am hoping this image of her distinctive car may jog people's memories. Did you see her driving home that evening?' Ms Li was last seen leaving the hospital and was reported missing by her . family five days later . Colleagues at Poole Hospital, where Ms Li worked, pictured above, described her as 'funny and unique' and have urged members of the public to come forward with information . Det Insp Hester added: 'I am even interested to know if you saw the car moving around or being driven by anyone else over the Bank Holiday weekend. We are also building a better picture of her lifestyle, interests and friends. 'We . know that she was a reliable and hardworking nurse at Poole Hospital, . who was popular with her colleagues, and also that she enjoyed outdoors . activities, including climbing. 'However, since moving to the UK from China around a decade ago, she has also led quite a private personal life. 'I am keen to speak to anyone who knows her well and would reassure them they are not breaking any trust by speaking to us.' Her colleagues from Poole Hospital have appealed for the public's help in tracking down the missing nurse.

"By . Steph Cockroft . Max Clifford, who was jailed for a string of indecent assaults, has lodged appealed against his sentence . Disgraced celebrity publicist Max Clifford has lodged an appeal against his sentence after he was jailed for eight years for a string of historic sex offences. Clifford, 71, was convicted earlier this month of eight indecent assaults, which he committed after luring and 'degrading' women through his celebrity connections. He was the first person to be convicted under high profile Operation Yewtree and was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court to eight years in prison. When Clifford was sentenced, Judge Anthony Leonard said that, due to the age of the offences, Clifford was charged under an . act from 1956, which set the maximum term for each charge at two years. Under later legislation passed in 2003, the maximum term would have been ten years. For the worst instances, the charges would have been rape or assault by penetration, which attract a maximum life term. The Court of Appeal today confirmed that Clifford had lodged the appeal. Passing sentence, Judge Anthony Leonard told Clifford his personality and position in the public eye were the reasons his crimes - which took place between 1977 and 1984 - were not revealed earlier. Judge Leonard said: 'The reason why they were not brought to light sooner was because of your own dominant character and your position in the world of entertainment which meant that your victims thought that you were untouchable, something that I think you too believed.' He added: 'These offences may have taken place a long time ago, when inappropriate and trivial sexual behaviour was more likely to be tolerated, but your offending was not trivial, but of a very serious nature.' The PR guru was jailed for eight years, after . being convicted of historic sex offences under the high-profile . Operation Yewtree. He and his wife Jo, pictured, started divorce . proceedings after the verdicts . Clifford was charged with 11 counts . of indecently assaulting seven women aged 14 to 19, between 1966 and . 1984. He was cleared of two charges and jurors were unable to reach a decision on the third. The former celebrity agent remained defiant after he was convicted, saying: 'I stand by everything I have said in the last 17 months.' Clifford branded his accusers . compensation-seekers and attention-hunters, labelling them as 'fantasists'. He said he did not know any . of his accusers, and although he had had sexual encounters with ‘many’ women, he said it was all consensual. After the trial, it was confirmed that his wife Jo, 51, was filing for divorce.","The disgraced celebrity publicist was jailed for eight years earlier this month .

"By . Rob Davies . Iraj Parvizi, 48, is suing a London casino for his £10m losses, over claims . he was the victim of a sting involving card sharps and masseuses . A wealthy financier is suing a London casino for his £10million losses, claiming an elaborate sting involving card sharps and masseuses. Iraj Parvizi played in a weekly private game for millionaire high-rollers, held at London’s prestigious Les Ambassadeurs casino – which featured in the James Bond film Dr No. The game, in which players regularly bet six-figure sums, was attended by Arab sheikhs and footballers including ex-Arsenal player Nicklas Bendtner and former England striker Teddy Sheringham. Mr Parvizi, 48, claims a game in which he lost £185,000 in one night was undermined by a conspiracy between professional poker players out to take him for every penny he had. The dispute began when Les Ambassadeurs sued Mr Parvizi, after he cancelled cheques to the casino for the £185,000 worth of chips used during that night’s game. Mr Parvizi counter-sued, alleging in documents filed with the High Court that the casino failed to stop ‘collusion and cheating’ and claiming for £10million. The sum represents all the money he lost over nearly four years of games, which Mr Parvizi says were all tainted. He claims that two professional players were working together, encouraging him to bet as much as possible. They would then split their winnings, according to Mr Parvizi. Mr Parvizi also raised concerns over a troupe of masseuses brought in to help players relax during the long and tense sessions. He accused Craig Stevens, who oversaw the poker game on behalf of the casino, of employing the girls to be ‘under his instruction’. Legal documents claim that ‘two or three’ masseuses ‘attended on each game, circulating between the players (from which positions they would be able to look at and communicate players’ hands)’. On the night of the disputed game Mr Parvizi claims masseuses that he had not seen before, had ‘opportunities for inconspicuous inspection and signalling of players’ cards to others’. Les Ambassadeurs – whose slogan is ‘where there is no apology for privilege’ – called Mr Parvizi’s claims against it ‘embarrassing’ in papers filed with the High Court. Les Ambassadeurs casino - whose slogan is 'where there is no . apology for privilege - . overlooks Hyde Park from Hamilton Place, London . Lawyers for the casino added that it was an ‘accepted poker strategy’ for stronger players to encourage weaker players to bet more. The casino featured in Dr No, a James Bond film which starred Sean Connery, pictured . They added that the casino has no knowledge of any strategy that took place during the game. Speaking on condition of anonymity, one of the high-rollers who played with Mr Parvizi dismissed his claims as absurd. ‘No-one would need to cheat to beat Iraj. We’re professionals and he’s terrible, so it’s like Brazil versus San Marino in football. ‘As a professional player, you sometimes need credit and you rely on your reputation. I’d rather lose than collude.’ He added that regular players would have considered the £185,000 that Mr Parvizi lost that night to be ‘nothing’. Les Ambassadeurs, with its prestigious location at Hamilton Place, overlooking Hyde Park, is owned by Indonesian tobacco billionaire Putera Sampoerna and is known for attracting the super-rich. Mr Parvizi, a financier who is based in Dubai, declined to comment on the lawsuit. He denied last year a charge of insider dealing and is due to face trial in September. Les Ambassadeurs declined to comment and Mr Stevens could not be reached.","Iraj Parvizi played in weekly game for millionaires at Les Ambassadeurs .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Sir John Major said Nigel Farage's win would inadvertently help David Cameron . UKIP's stunning election victories last week will help David Cameron win concessions from Europe, former Prime Minister John Major claimed today. Sir John said European leaders could no longer ignore rising euroscepticism and return powers to Britain in the Prime Minister's renogotiation. He predicted that the Prime Minister would win restrictions to free movement rules to curb immigration. Sir John claimed the success of Ukip and other anti-EU parties would force other European leaders to listen to Mr Cameron's demands. But he said despite Nigel Farage popularity his party would soon slump in the polls. He said UKIP was a 'very intolerant' party and its appeal is not likely to last for a 'long time' despite its success in the European elections. Sir John Major said: 'The recent European elections have emphasised that very clearly. I think the results of these negotiations right across Europe have made a renegotiation much easier. 'It’s apparent now to governments right across Europe that reform of the European Union is necessary – it isn’t working as it should, it isn’t working in the way in which European citizens think it should. 'And I think that gives a great deal of power to the British determination to renegotiate because they will have allies today which in the 1990s we, frankly, didn’t have.' He claimed the UK had won concessions from European in the past and Mr Cameron would be able to do the same. The former Tory leader said: 'Many people, when I went to Maastricht said it would not be possible to negotiate Britain out of the euro, I did. 'They said it wouldn’t be possible to negotiate us out of the social chapter, I did. 'More recently, they said David Cameron couldn’t negotiate a budget reduction, he did. 'Now, they’re just three, there are several other things the Prime Minister has done which people said couldn’t be done. So let us not say it can’t be done - it can be done and I think this Prime Minister can do it and I think these recent elections will help him do it.' David Cameron, speaking shortly after arriving in Brussels this week, demanded that the EU stopped being so 'bossy' Sir John said people would 'surprised' with how much the Prime Minister would be able to do. He said: 'Of course, nobody can be certain what will happen, but as the Prime Minister has said himself, free movement of people cannot be unqualified and I think that is very important.' He added: 'Free movement of capital, trade and people is one of the fundamentals, but I think that is an issue that will have to be addressed by governments other than us. 'And I think there are some things that could be done, as the Prime Minister’s already said, free movement to take up work, not benefits. ' I don’t think you can have an absolute restriction on movements, but maybe you could qualify it in different ways and I think that is something that would find an echo in many European governments, as well as here.' The former PM also insisted that Mr Cameron would bring back enough from other EU leaders to satisfy British demands and win a referendum. He said the public would back Britain's place in Europe - and eventually lose interest in UKIP. Sir John said Mr Farage has been 'very smart.. at exploiting grievances'. Nigel Farage was congratulated by fellow European MEPs after winning last week's elections . But he warned that the arguments for quitting Europe are 'absolute nonsense' and said it would cost billions. He said: 'Ukip are extremely good at exploiting grievances and people are very upset about Europe. Politically, Ukip have been very smart in exploiting those disagreements, but Ukip are not, frankly, a very tolerant party. 'I don’t think their appeal is one that is instinctively likely to continue for a long time and I think we have seen that in some of the things they have done recently. So I think they are there and of course they are an impediment for the moment.' He added that the investment which has helped Britain's economic recovery had not just come for our 'pretty blue eyes' but because of the single market and the European Union. He said: ""Frankly [those calling for Britain to leave the EU] are wrong. Much of this publicity about that is absolute nonsense. We would lose free access to the single market ... we’d have to pay for access to the single market.'","Former PM claims EU leaders can no longer ignore euroscepticism .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Restrained: Anthony Wells, 31, was given a restraining order and also sectioned at Basildon Crown Court today . A Twitter troll who sent hundreds of abusive messages to Countdown star Rachel Riley has been given a restraining order. Anthony Wells, 31, 'distressed' the 28-year-old presenter by sending her more than 500 messages over social media - some of which included threats on her life. Wells, from Chelmsford in Essex, also targeted Coldplay singer Chris Martin and said that he would shoot his children in a sustained seven-month campaign. He was today given a five-year restraining order at Basildon Crown Court in Essex after admitting a charge of harassment against Miss Riley, while the charge relating to Mr Martin was not pursued. The charge stated that tweets sent from Wells’ Twitter account had 'caused Rachel Riley to fear that violence would be used against her'. One incoherent tweet posted by Wells - whom the court heard has mental health issues - read: 'Helping them might be Rachel and Chris Martin yet again trying to steal the rest of my songs for EMI and Sony. Kill them now'. Jamie Sawyer, prosecuting, told the court: 'Ultimately this case revolves around harassment causing fear of violence by Mr Wells between October 2012 and May 2013. 'Effectively what he did was send a persistent series of abusive Twitter messages. 'Rachel Riley is something of a celebrity, a TV presenter on Countdown, who is married with children and uses her Twitter account to communicate with fans and advertise where she will be attending. 'Around 500 tweets were sent during the time of the indictment. The nature of these messages was always abusive. 'The messages sent to Rachel Riley of course caused her distress. Her personal statement gives a graphic description of her reaction to the tweets. 'In our observation these two complainants deserve protection and reassurance'. Wells appeared in court alongside a mental health nurse and wore a grey suit jacket, jeans and white trainers. 'Caused distress': Countdown star Rachel Riley felt threatened by the stream of messages . Judge Owen Davies QC told the court the case was a ‘delicate matter’ due to Wells's health problems. Eleanor Scott, mitigating, told the court her client has been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and his abusive tweets had been influenced by ‘psychotic thinking’. She said: 'At the time Mr Wells was significantly influenced by psychotic thinking. He is still a very mentally fragile individual but has pleaded guilty to the charge and understands what he did was wrong. 'He is happy to abide by a restraining order.' Judge Davies QC imposed a restraining order banning Wells from contacting both Rachel Riley and Chris Martin either directly or indirectly. He also sectioned Wells under the Mental Health Act. Sentencing Wells, he said: 'You’re currently in hospital and for the moment that is the right place for you to be. I am going to make a Section 37 hospital order under the Mental Health Act. Also targeted: Wells sent messages to Coldplay member Christ Martin as well . 'That is an order requiring you to remain in hospital until authorities require otherwise'. Punam Malhan, CPS East of England senior district prosecutor said: 'When Anthony Wells admitted harassing Rachel Riley at an earlier hearing we asked for an adjournment so we could seek the views of the other victim in this case, Chris Martin, on continuing with the charge which involved him. 'Mr Martin indicated that a plea to the charge involving Ms Riley would be acceptable to ensure that Mr Wells gets the medical help he needs and that he was content for us to not to proceed in relation to the remaining charge. 'Taking Mr Martin’s view into account we decided it was no longer in the public interest to continue with the second charge of harassment and that charge was today left on file. 'Wells has been sentenced to a hospital order under sec 37 Mental Health Act and a restraining order was imposed for a period of five years with a prohibition not to contact Rachel Riley or Chris Martin. 'Everyone should be able to go about their daily lives free from harassment caused by someone deliberately making offensive, violent messages about them on social media. 'We take allegations of this kind very seriously and especially where there is evidence of a course of conduct which causes fear or distress to someone, regardless of whether a victim is in the public eye or not'.","Anthony Wells, 31, 'distressed' Miss Riley with social media messages .

"By . Dan Bloom . A British witch doctor who conned her 'patients' out of £1million to become one of the most prolific conwomen in history has been jailed for 10 years. Juliette D'Souza, 59, persuaded 11 clients to hand over their life savings - which she insisted would be hung from a magic tree in the Amazon as a sacrifice. Instead she spent the cash on first class flights, antique furniture and a £3,000 Hermes handbag. 'Pure evil': Juliette D'Souza told one client that a relative would die if she did not continue giving her money . Jailed: Juliette D'Souza has been described as one of Britain's most prolific conwomen in history . Bizarrely, she would buy designer goods she never used and rent luxury homes which she never visited. Today D'Souza was jailed for 10 years at Blackfriars Crown Court, where police claimed she was every bit as dangerous as a violent criminal. Judge Ian Karsten QC . said she had cast a 'spell' over her victims - who had cancer, disabilities, sick relatives, job worries and fertility problems - persuading them to hand . over the money or face 'terrifying' consequences including the death of their loved ones. A jury took just an hour to convict her of 23 counts of fraud and obtaining property by deception, spanning 12 years from 1998 to 2010. The self-proclaimed healer said she had helped cure John Cleese’s daughter of cancer, boasted of knowing Princess Diana and claimed she could introduce a young . singer to Simon Cowell. Advertising her services . in Tatler magazine, she charged just £35 for a consultation but then . demanded huge sums to be used as the 'sacrifices' in Suriname, South America. There she claimed two other shamans would perform . rituals around the money before it was sent back with all the victims' problems resolved - but the money was never returned. In one especially horrifying case, a client handed over £176,000 in a desperate bid to fall pregnant. The witch doctor of Hampstead: The 59-year-old spent the money on luxury goods she never used . When she finally conceived, D'Souza told her to have . an abortion because . her foetus would be grossly deformed and ‘evil’. Her lies were finally uncovered, along with . ‘voodoo black magic’ which included freezers . stuffed with rotting meat and an abandoned capuchin monkey which was later adopted by Stephen Fry. Judge Karsten told her today: 'It is the worst case of confidence fraud I have ever had to deal with or indeed that I have ever heard of. 'The most serious aspect of this case is that you wrecked the lives of a number of your victims and you have done it out of pure greed. 'You told a number of victims the money would be returned. The reality, as it has emerged, is that you didn’t send any of this . money to South America. You used the cash for your own purposes. 'You . cheated each and every one of these victims. You were able to exercise a . considerable influence and indeed a spell over these victims.' A number of victims were 'subjugated' to . her will so that they 'lost all of their autonomy' and became 'entirely . dependent' on her, he said. 'To reinforce their dependence on you, . you initially saw to it that they were cut off from their friends and . family,' he added. 'You warned them about the ""evil temperament"" of the people to . whom they were close.' Many victims were left in financial ruin, with one man 'as poor as a church mouse', while the conwoman 'remorselessly extracted' more than £200,000 from an elderly woman over several years. The official amount she defrauded was £908,400, but on the evidence given by victims the final sum was closer to £1million. Police believe the total taken by D'Souza - who had similar previous convictions - could be higher still. D’Souza’s . web was finally untangled in 2007 as she made a series of mistakes . which aroused her victims’ suspicions. She claimed to have attended St . Hilliard’s College, Oxford, which does not exist and got the name of . Princess Diana’s sister wrong. The . woman who had an abortion realised she had been scammed and went to . Hampstead police station in north London, but said officers ‘laughed in . my face’. Victims: Hampstead osteopath Keith Bender, left, referred clients to D'Souza in the belief she could help. Opera singer Silvia Eaves handed over £256,000 for help with stomach problems and to invest in a clinic in Peru . This left her so . angry she forced her way into D’Souza’s home with the help of Mr Bender, . who was paying the rent on that property, and three others. Inside they . found the voodoo treasure trove – which also included drawings of an . ‘evil eye’, burned photos and a brand new barrister’s wig. D’Souza . would give her 'customers' detailed instructions about how the money . was to be paid - always in cash and in a brown envelope. Part of her . system was to demand a full-length photograph from each victim. One . victim - who was told to pay £18,000 or her partner would die - said: . 'I was absolutely terrified. I was living in fear and doing what I was . told.' Another was . 82-year-old former opera singer Sylvia Eaves, who was duped out of more . than £350,000 by D’Souza between 1998 and 2010. Another still was the mother of a . ten-year-old boy with Down’s Syndrome who was conned out of £42,000 when . D’Souza claimed she could cure his behavioural problems. The . widow, whom the judge described as a 'delightful lady', handed over the . money for various reasons including help with a stomach problem and to . 'save' her ill sister. Voodoo dolls: D'Souza's con was exposed when Mr Bender and property manager Keith Mcmahon grew suspicious and broke into her four flats at Willoughby Road in Hampstead, north London . Pet: Mr Bender had been visiting one flat to feed D'Souza's pet monkey, Joey, but did not dare enter the remaining flats for fear they were cursed. The money was later adopted by the TV comic Stephen Fry . 'I’m . relieved that she won’t be doing it to anybody else,' Mrs Eaves said . today. 'I feel terribly sad that somebody who is so clever would resort . to that, especially as she was a friend of mine. I feel terribly let . down that she could behave like that. 'She relieved me of a lot of money but I’m still here. I was gullible, I suppose, but my sister was very ill at the time.' Other . victims included retired solicitor Richard Collier-Wright, who paid . £7,000 to cure his terminal leukaemia, and former photographer Jocelyn . Bain-Hogg, who handed D’Souza thousands to improve the health of his . mother who was having heart surgery. A . couple, who cannot be named, gave tens of thousands to the fraudster . after she claimed she could help with their child’s disability and . behavioural problems. Another . victim, Geoffrey Wheeler, handed over around £160,000 to 'protect' him . from being made redundant but was left in financial ruin. Gear: Piles of rubbish filled the flats and stacks of carrier bags from designer stores littered the rooms . Her barrister, Stephen Fidler, told the court D’Souza’s elderly mother had been unwell for a . considerable time and she visits her every day. But the judge told her: 'I find no mitigating factors in your case at all.' Detective . Constables Linda Kernot and Fiona Graham said: 'We are very pleased . with the sentence. It reflects the serious nature of her actions and the . fact that she has shown no remorse. 'We are relieved that her evil schemes have been stopped as we consider Juliette D’Souza as dangerous as a violent offender. 'She . is a nasty, cruel person who targeted vulnerable people, preying on . them when they were desperate for support and guidance. In the end, her . greed and arrogance was her downfall. 'We want to thank the victims for showing great courage in standing up to her and giving their evidence.'","Juliette D'Souza, 59, from London, conned life savings from 11 people .

"By . Julian Robinson . The deputy leader of a council has been suspended after sending messages to a radio station pretending to be different people – so he could praise his own authority. Paul Shotton used names including Alison, Jean and Dave as he sent in texts during debates on BBC Radio Stoke backing Stoke-on-Trent City Council and criticising the opposition. In messages sent in to the breakfast show with Stuart George and Charlotte Foster, the Labour councillor of 11 years also pretended to be from different areas of Stoke-on-Trent including Smallthorne and Fenton. 'Hi, I'm Jean': (aka Paul Shotton) 'Hi, I'm Dave': (aka Paul Shotton) 'Hi, I'm Alison': (aka Paul Shotton) But after six months, BBC staff eventually became suspicious after they spotted that the messages- around 16 of them - were coming from the same mobile number under names such as Alison, Jean and Dave. Mr Shotton, who will now face a council standards board hearing, has since admitted sending the texts and apologised ‘fully’ for his actions. He said: 'I apologise fully for my actions. They were plain stupid. I will never do anything like this again.' But he has now been suspended by West Midlands Labour Party, which said in a statement: ‘The Labour Party takes these matters very seriously. 'Cllr Paul Shotton has been suspended pending an investigation.’ The cabinet member for economic development and ward councillor for Fenton East is also managing director at Bar O2 Limited, which specialises in supplying firms with Oxygen and associated equipment. A BBC spokesperson a journalist recognised the phone number and referred the issue to the council. He added: ‘Audience interaction is an important part of our programmes and we read out texts from our listeners in good faith but we are reliant on the audience being upfront and honest about who they are.’ Paul Shotton will now face a standards board hearing at the Stoke-on-Trent City Council headquarters, pictured . Mr Shotton was not at a meeting of the council's cabinet held on Thursday night but the council's leader Mohammed Pervez has taken on his cabinet responsibilities.

Gerry Clarke, The Council’s Deputy Monitoring Officer said: 'The Council has been alerted to allegations made against the Deputy Leader of the Council. On the basis of information that has been provided, the Council will initiate a standards board process to enable the facts of this case to be appropriately investigated.

"By . Martin Robinson . A young mother who was eight-months pregnant has died along with her unborn child after she collapsed while brushing her teeth just two days after being sent home from hospital. Jade Glen, 22, was found at her parents' home by her father on Monday after worried friends went to the house to find out why she had failed to answer her phone. Today her boyfriend and family paid tribute to their 'golden girl and rock' and demanded answers from the NHS. Tragedy: Jade Glen, 22, pictured with her son Mickey, was eight months pregnant when she collapsed and died along with her unborn child . Much-loved: Jade with her boyfriend Michael, who has called her his 'golden girl' and 'rock' and wants the NHS to explain why she was sent home . On Monday loved-ones who rushed to the house saw Jade's 18-month-old son Mickey wandering around inside with no sign of his mother. Bereft: Jade was found on the bathroom floor with her tootbrush by her father Floyd . Her father Floyd Glen, 52, then found his child on the bathroom floor. The cold tap was still running and her toothbrush was lying next to her. The young mother had been discharged from Medway Hospital in May after eight days of treatment for a suspected blood clot. She returned to hospital on Saturday because she was feeling unwell, but after being checked, was sent home again. Boyfriend Michael Arnold, 28, a tradesman, said: 'She was my golden girl, my rock. 'I can't understand why the doctors let her out - she was obviously ill but they told her she was OK. That hospital has got a lot of questions to answer. 'Jade was beautiful, so bubbly, and she loved her music. I just can't believe she's gone.' Jade's mum, Trish Chart, 49, said: 'It is nice to know that she spent her last few hours with Mickey. 'She got to take him to his first day at playschool on Friday and she was so pleased to be able to do that. Mickey was everything to her. 'She had bought lots of things for Dolly and everything was ready. 'She was the funniest, most intelligent person you could meet. She was crazy - she would ring you up at 4am for a chat. But she was so generous and so kind. She had a heart of gold.' Jade's Facebook page has been flooded with tributes, and her family have been inundated with messages of support. Concerned: Friends were worried that Jade had failed to answer the phone so went round and saw Mickey wandering the house but no sign of his mother . Julie Poole wrote on Facebook: 'RIP beautiful angels. My whole family and me are so shocked and sad. Will always miss you Jade and still think of all the crazy times. You was feisty and fun and a real gem, family loving girl.' Keziah Bangar wrote: 'Still can't believe what's happened. Jade was the cheekiest one and was always up for a laugh. So many good memories. You've touched everyone's lives and are extremely loved and missed by us all. You were never afraid to just be yourself and are beautiful.'

"By . Wills Robinson . A teenager accused of plotting a Columbine-inspired massacre has escaped terror charges after a second Old Bailey jury could not reach a verdict. Michael Piggin, 18, outlined detailed plans of deadly attacks on two schools, the local mosque, council offices and Loughborough University in his diaries. But two successive juries could not decide whether he was guilty or not and defendants are never tried for third time. The A-level student, now 18, wrote about arming himself with guns, bombs, and knives in a deadly assault inspired by Anders Breivik. Verdict: Michael Piggin, 18, who wrote about planning a Columbine-inspired massacre, has escaped terror charges after two Old Bailey juries could not decide whether he was guilty or not guilty . Room: This is Michael Piggin's room which features posters of a swastika and the Joker from Batman . But he claimed the details of his ‘Operation’ were a way of venting his anger rather than serious plans. Prosecutor Gareth Patterson said: ‘If this jury cannot return verdicts that will be the conclusion of the proceedings.’ Piggin was cleared of preparing an act of terrorism and other terror offences. He admitted possessing a knife and confessed to possessing parts for an improvised explosive device halfway through the trial. He will be sentenced for those charges on June 13. The teenager’s bedroom floor was littered with knives, air guns, a machete, and a crossbow, while a Nazi swastika flag took pride of place on his wall. Piggin built pipe bombs, smoke . grenades and improvised explosives in his bedroom and tested Molotov . cocktails behind the local leisure centre. He . was arrested after brandishing a knife at a young boy and threatening . to stab him for throwing an empty drinks can at him in Loughborough town . centre. Other charges: He admitted possessing a knife and parts for an improvised explosive device halfway through the trial . The teenager, who has Asperger’s Syndrome, denied he had been plotting terrorist acts and said his diary entries were not serious. His lawyers claimed he had been just ‘retreating into fantasy.’ Piggin was charged with possessing an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, and possessing a document likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. He pleaded guilty to possessing an offensive weapon and possessing an article for a purpose connected with terrorism. Two of Piggin’s best friend were each sentenced to community orders last year after they admitted possessing petrol bombs and pipe bomb parts before the trial began. The 18-year-old boys from Loughborough cannot be named because of an ongoing legal battle to grant them life-long anonymity.","Michael Piggin, 18, wrote about deadly attacks on two schools and a mosque .

"By . Julian Robinson . Risking lives on one of the busiest motorways in Britain, this woman was spotted casually reading a book at the wheel of her car - while driving at up to 70mph. The driver was travelling alone along the M1 in Leicestershie with the book spread across her steering wheel - and even carried on turning pages when other motorists were frantically waving at her to stop. Road safety campaigners have called the pictures 'shocking' while police described the behaviour as 'irresponsible and dangerous'. A real page turner: This driver was pictured reading her book at the wheel while travelling at 70mph along the M1 motorway . Builder Andrew Stonham was heading home on the M1 in Leicestershire when he spotted the reckless act. He first saw her at junction 25 - and continued alongside the blue Nissan Micra until junction 27 ten miles away. Mr Stonham, 28, who was the passenger in a workmate’s vehicle, said: 'We saw her about 200 yards back and my friend said he thought something was up. 'We caught up with her but we were struggling to keep up in the central lane. It’s not even like she was in the slow lane. 'We were beeping at her and I was waving at her out of the window. She finally looked over, smiled and waved before carrying on as normal.' Mr . Stonham, from Kirkby, Nottinghamshire, took a mobile phone picture of . the woman from the passenger seat of the vehicle he was in last . Wednesday between 3.30pm and 4pm. The . father-of-three noticed other drivers flashing their lights at her and . witnessed her continuing to read until he and his colleague pulled off . the motorway at Junction 27. 'We’re . on the motorway all the time and we see people eating or putting on . make-up, stuff like that, but this was unbelievable,' he added. The woman was seen driving ten miles along the M1 through Leicestershire from junction 25 to junction 27, as indicated in red on the map . The woman carried on turning pages even when other motorists started beeping and waving their arms at her . 'I . would like the police to try and attempt to track her down if possible, . because she needs to be told that this behaviour is not acceptable and . can result in death. 'The . road was busy at the time and she could have quite have easily have . ploughed into the back of somebody. I have no idea what she was . thinking. 'She even acknowledged we were there but just seemed oblivious to the fact that she was doing anything wrong. It was crazy' James McLoughlin, spokesperson for road safety charity Brake, called the image 'shocking'. 'At Brake, we work with many families who have lost loved ones and had their lives torn apart because someone decided to multi-task at wheel. 'We're calling on government to increase fines and make traffic policing a national priority to deter risky, multi-tasking drivers. 'We urge all drivers to save any other activities until they're safely out of the car.' A Nottinghamshire Police spokesperson said: 'This behaviour is clearly irresponsible and dangerous and if witnessed by police we will act accordingly and seek to prosecute the driver. 'Any images taken by a third party member of the public and provided to police will be treated as intelligence.'","Woman was flicking through pages of a book on busy stretch of the M1 .

The youths, who look distinctively young, targeted the youngster who was cycling in woodland in Blackley, Greater Manchester, earlier this month. After approaching him on the afternoon of May 5, one of the boys kicked him and pinned him down while the other plundered an iPhone 4s from his pocket. Young thugs: The police are hunting these baby-faced robbers after a 12-year-old schoolboy had his bike stolen during an attack earlier this month . The boys, who are both white and described as being about 15 years old, ran off into the woods. One had ginger hair and freckles and the other had blonde hair. The victim was not seriously injured. Detective Constable Mike Keogh of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'What is immediately striking - and concerning - is just how young these two robbers appear. 'They have been described as being 15 or 16 years old and while their baby faces give them a younger appearance we have been able to compile two very realistic images and I am certain someone in the local community will recognise them.

"By . Harriet Arkell . A London trader who refused to take part in his company initiation ceremony of running across the office while colleagues doused him in water is suing his former firm for unfair dismissal. Robert Bou-Simon, a broker at BGC Partners, told an employment tribunal he was the victim of a campaign of abuse after he declined to participate in 'the run' after his first trade at the firm's London office. The Australian, who was head of the New York-based firm's basis swaps desk, said he had to resign after he was victimised and taunted about his support for Chelsea Football Club and an Australian rugby team. But his former firm argued that he was the subject of disciplinary investigations after he had fallen asleep at his desk. BGC said Robert Bou-Simon had fallen asleep at his desk, but he argued it wasn't uncommon there, and says he was victimised for refusing to undergo initiation rite (file picture shows another broker at BGC) Mr Bou-Simon says he was hounded out of his job at BGC's London office, pictured, after refusing to do 'the run' Mr Bou-Simon said in a witness statement that his refusal to go through with the initiation ceremony 'did not go down well with my colleagues on the floor', who chanted ""only real men run"", The Times reported. He said he believed the practice was unsafe, and cited a case of one worker who had to be taken to hospital after crashing into a piece of furniture.  Mr Bou-Simon said that his manager described his refusal to take part as 'downright un-Australian'. The trader, who rejoined BGC in 2012 having worked for it seven years beforehand, said he was also taunted for supporting sports teams his colleagues did not. Mr Bou-Simon also complained that his manager, Mark Webster, had tried to force him out of the firm by offering him an unsuitable position at a company unit called Mint. But his brokerage firm alleged that he had fallen asleep at his desk - which Mr Bou-Simon said was not uncommon at BGC - and was the subject of disciplinary proceedings. Mr Webster said he and Mr Bou-Simon, who now works at Vantage Capital Markets, had agreed his move to the new role, and denied trying to force him out. BGC did not respond to MailOnline's request for comment. The hearing continues. Fundraising: Princes Harry and William visited the BGC London offices last September for a charity event . Cambridge graduate and high-flying banker Svetlana Lokhova won an employment tribunal against the Russian Sberbank after claiming she was victimised . Last year,banker Svetlana Lokhova, 32, won a sexual harassment claim against her Russian-based firm, Sberbank. The Cambridge graduate, who worked at the company's London office on Fleet Street, said she was targeted after reporting a senior trader for insider dealing. She told an employment tribunal how she was nicknamed 'Crazy Miss Cokehead' and told to visit Nigeria for sex with tribesmen to 'calm her down'. Six months ago, Morgan Stanley trader Benjamin Price won a payout from the American bank after suing the firm for unfair dismissal. Mr Price said he was unfairly sacked from his job because he complained about being paid less than the firm agreed.  He said he had taken the job after being offered a deal worth about £670,000 a year, but said he was paid just £533,000, before it was cut to £518,000. Mr Price said the culture at Morgan Stanley was such that it only allowed people to speak out if they agreed with senior bosses. Mr Price told the panel yesterday: ‘Despite my good performance, I was a squeaky wheel who was not prepared to put up and shut up.' The East London Employment Tribunal agreed, and Morgan Stanley was ordered to pay Mr Price undisclosed compensation. And earlier this year, City broker Robin Clark, 44, was gunned down at Shenfield station in Essex in an incident still being investigated by police. The talented money-maker, who works as a Euro derivatives trader at RP Martin, was shot in the leg at point blank range. On his first day back at work after being sewn up, his colleagues played a trick on him, sneaking up behind him and shouting 'bang'.

"By . Darren Boyle . This is the moment when a city centre came to a standstill as a group of superheroes began dancing along the street. Despite looking like some form of film production, it was in fact a wedding proposal where Matthew Hill asked girlfriend Jamie-Lee Johnson to marry him. Mr Hill was dressed as Batman when he went down on one knee, before the group of superheroes and asked for Ms Johnson's hand in marriage. Jamie-Lee Johnson was sitting in a Cardiff cafe when the Belle from Beauty and the Beast asked her to step outside . Ms Johnson, clearly looking surprised as she steps out onto the street to be faced with a flashmob dancing . The 22-year-old dancer was greeted by a group of dancers, performing a flashmob . The epic proposal began when Ms Johnson was whisked away from a cafe by Belle from Beauty and the Beast. A dancing flashmob then followed her through the city's streets before Mr Hill, dressed as Batman, appears from behind a group of super hero friends with ring in hand. Despite the shock, Ms Johnson didn't hesitate to say yes as a large gathered crowd cheered. Ms Johnson is escorted down the street by Belle to where boyfriend Matthew Hill has planned his surprise . Mr Hill, 28, is originally from Abertillery but now lives in Brean, Somerset with his girlfriend, said he chose to propose through flash mob because he wanted a day that neither of them would ever forget. 'I really wanted to make something special and memorable and this combines things we both love. 'Jamie is a dancer and loves Disney and I love super heroes. I chose to propose in Cardiff because Wales is my home and I love it. 'I wanted somewhere grand to propose to Jamie, something much grander than Brean, Somerset. 'It was mind blowing when it happened. I sat down in the coffee shop and I made an excuse to leave and then before I knew it I was being stuffed into a batman costume and getting ready to propose.' Ms Johnson still had no idea what was happening when a group of super heroes walked towards her . Eventually, when the super heroes parted, Batman appeared and went down onto one knee and produced a ring from his utility belt . Luckily Ms Johnson accepted the unusual proposal in front of almost 100 people . Ms Johnson, 22, met Mr Hill while dancing at the  Brean Sands Holiday Park where they both work. She said: 'I'm still in shock. It was really good but I still can't believe it happened. 'I had no idea what was planned. I thought I was going shopping with my birthday money. When the princess appeared in the cafe it still didn't even click that something was going on. I got very emotional when I realised. I started crying straight away.' The happy couple are now planning to buy a house before getting married in 2016. Michael Platt, Party Heroes owner and Mathew's best mate, said it was a magical event. 'Mathew is one of my best friends and he asked us to help him out with this idea and we said we'd make it happen. 'It was stressful because I wanted it to go right and be perfect for them but once it happened it was magical.

"By . Julian Robinson . Andrew Hewes, pictured, got a 'buzz' out of removing his trousers and underwear before driving alongside the girls, a court heard . A scuba diving instructor has been jailed after repeatedly driving past schoolgirls - while naked from the waist down. Andrew Hewes, 51, got a ‘buzz’ out of removing his trousers and underwear before driving alongside the girls, a court heard. He was reported by four victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, after they became aware of his car - a Rover with a large car sticker promoting a diving school. Wakefield and Pontefract Magistrates Court heard how Hewes passed them at least four times while they were walking in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, in December last year. After originally denying outraging public decency, Hewes was convicted following a trial, and was jailed for 24 weeks. Dan Smith, mitigating, said his client had no relevant previous convictions, had been married for 32 years and had worked in the Navy, the Home Office and as an engineer. He was also a volunteer diving instructor. Mr Smith said: “His sense of guilt is overwhelming. He knew he was in the wrong. 'He knew there was a possibility he could be seen. 'He is sorry to the girls. Perhaps they can take some confidence from the point he has accepted his responsibility. Scuba diving instructor Andrew Hewes, pictured, has been jailed after repeatedly driving past schoolgirls - while naked from the waist down . 'He now has to face his family, friends and employer and the stigma of the offence.' District Judge Adrian Lower, referring to Hewes’ interview with a probation officer, said: 'You decided to stop, pull down your underwear and trousers and got back in your car and drove further. 'You described to the probation officer how this gave you a buzz. 'There was clearly an element of planning in what you did. The office has obvious sexual overtones and motivation behind it.' The judge said: 'The four girls who saw what you did in December last year had to relive that experience by giving evidence at trial. After originally denying outraging public decency, Andrew Hewes, left, was convicted following a trial, and was jailed for 24 weeks . “The punishment is going to be greater than if you had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.' He said he had a duty to protect the public and to send out a strong message by a fitting punishment of custody. Mr Lower added: 'I can’t suspend it. It was a serious matter involving four members of the public of school age. There was repetition and planning.' After sentence Mr Smith lodged a notice of appeal against sentence but Judge Lewer said Hewes would remain in custody pending an appeal at Leeds Crown Court.","Andrew Hewes got a 'buzz' out of removing underwear, a court is told .

"By . Richard Spillett . A crime tsar compared to David Brent has attempted to defend herself after police officers branded her a 'laughing stock' following an 'embarrassing' Channel 4 documentary about her job. Viewers reacted with fury to last night's Meet The Police Commissioner programme in which Ann Barnes, elected crime chief for Kent, struggled to explain her £85,000-a-year taxpayer-funded role. Mrs Barnes today tried to calm anger over the fly-on-the-wall show, claiming the programme placed 'too much emphasis' on her. Scroll down for video . Ann Barnes is facing mounting criticism of her £85,000-a-year role as Kent police commissioner after a 'car crash' TV documentary, which showed her travelling around the county in her 'Ann Force 1' van . Mrs Barnes was compared to Ricky Gervais's desperate character David Brent after she was filmed struggling to explain her publicly-funded job with Kent Police . The documentary showed Mrs Barnes travelling in a van she dubs 'Ann Force 1', having difficulty explaining an approach to policing priorities called 'the onion' and bringing her dogs into the office. She also failed to write her title correctly on a whiteboard, was filmed painting her 'flaky' nails and compared the force to a tin of paint that she wanted to 'prise' open. Ian . Pointon, chairman of the Kent Police Federation, which represents . rank-and-file officers, told BBC Radio Kent: 'I think it was probably a . disaster from start to finish, in fairness. 'It . was an ill-advised concept and from within Kent Police I know that Mrs . Barnes was advised not to do it. It was never going to end well. 'I . think, sadly, it has turned Kent Police by association into something . of a laughing stock. Social media was alight with comments.' Viewers took to Twitter during and after the hour-long programme to say ex-teacher Mrs Barnes was an 'embarrassment' to Kent Police. Viewers attacked Mrs Barnes on Twitter, comparing her to comedy characters David Brent and Alan Partridge . Website . users compared her to Ricky Gervais' character from The Office, David Brent, with one commenting that the show was 'depressingly hilarious, hilariously depressing'. One viewer . tweeted: 'What an embarrassment Ann Barnes, PCC for Kent Police, is. Anybody watching this car crash TV? I'm not sure if this is a joke or . not.' Another said: 'Ann Barnes was like Kent's very own David Brent. A total embarrassment and waste of taxpayers' money.' The show was seen as a damning indictment of the elected roles, with 88 per cent of the more than 1,000 people who voted in a poll on local news website KentOnline saying they didn't think the Commissioner did a good job. This afternoon, a banner reading '#annbarnesout - resign' was flown over Maidstone, Kent where Mrs Barnes works. A plane towing the banner, whose pilot refused to say to paid for the sign, circled Kent Police HQ for around a quarter of an hour shortly after midday today. Mrs Barnes was branded a 'laughing stock' by a police officers, who said the programme was a 'disaster' After she was attacked by police officers and the public over the show, Mrs Barnes attempted to deflect criticism this morning, claiming that the programme put 'too much emphasis on me as an individual' Mrs Barnes tried to play down public anger at the show this morning, publishing a defence of her decision to appear on TV on her website. On what her 'Crime Onion' means: 'Oh God, I've got no idea - I can't tell you actually - I wasn't thinking I'd be talking about the actual onion (the concentric circles) as we call it - umm I don't know know really - everything's important.' On her job: 'Oh dear, what is a police commissioner? Right, well it's not the Police Commissioner, it's the Police and Crime Commissioner. 'It's a strange job because there is actually no description at all - there are certain responsibilities you have to do, but there is no actual job description.' On her Ann Force One battle bus: 'My budget is £317million, £15,000 is money well spent - I could have had a top of range Mercedes, but it's not my image.' She wrote: 'Many people have given their views on the programme and have speculated about my motivation for doing it. 'The only reason I agreed to do the documentary was to help people to better understand the job of a police and crime commissioner. 'The decision to let a film crew examine the work of the office for four months was not one I took lightly. 'I hoped it would give an insight into what is being done to help achieve the best possible police service for Kent. 'The film does go some way to addressing the complexities of the job and illustrates some of the challenges involved. 'But I am disappointed that there is too much emphasis on me as an individual and not enough on the work of the office. 'I know . that much of what the office has achieved was filmed and I am frustrated . that these scenes did not make it through to the final version.' Mrs Barnes . was elected as the first PCC in Kent in November 2012 despite . previously branding the Government's plan to increase police . accountability a 'wilful waste of money'. Ann Barnes stands next to Paris Brown, Britain's first youth crime commissioner who quit when it was revealed she had posted a series of highly offensive comments online . She . became the most high-profile of the country’s 41 crime tsars a year ago . when The Mail on Sunday revealed her £15,000 youth commissioner, Paris . Brown, 17, had posted a series of highly offensive comments online. Miss . Brown wrote the messages during the last six months before she was . given the role of helping the force ‘stay in touch with young people’. She . called homosexuals ‘fags’, immigrants ‘illegals’ and travellers . ‘pikeys’, and said she had ‘a thing for older men’, an apparent . reference to a teacher at her former school. Mrs Barnes tried to save the teenager's job, but Brown was forced to quit. Scathing: Commissioner Bob Jones claims PCCs have been a £100m waste of money . Police and crime commissioners have the job of ‘bringing communities closer to the police, building confidence in the system and restoring trust’. They were brought in across England and Wales in November 2012 by the Conservatives to set budgets and decide on strategies while also holding chief constables to account. But lack of enthusiasm for the reform meant the polls were held with little publicity, and a record low 15 per cent of voters turned out. They are tasked with creating a police and crime plan, setting the force budget and appointing or dismissing the chief constable. The former police authorities also had the power to hire and fire chief constables but this rarely happened. But one of the elected crime tsars branded them £100million waste of money and spend their time dreaming up gimmicks and clashing with senior officers. The Labour PCC for the West Midlands Bob Jones confessed that in their first year in charge of police forces, Police and Crime Commissioners did not make them run better nor made the public safer. PCCs have become embroiled in a series of  scandals, including: . Cumbria’s Tory PCC Richard Rhodes took two chauffeur-driven trips to meetings, costing taxpayers £700, and when the news was leaked to a local paper, the whistleblower was arrested. PCCs in Gwent and Lincolnshire forced out their chief constables. In each force only one person applied to take over the top job. A dozen or so PCCs handed out well-paid deputy roles to friends and allies without advertising them. At least four PCCs have already been investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission for alleged criminal misconduct. Several PCCs have caused controversy over expenses, including Norfolk’s Stephen Bett who declared his home as his place of work, allowing him to claim mileage for driving to the force HQ. He agreed to repay £3,000.","Police and Crime Commissioner mauled over 'car crash' Channel 4 show .

"By . Richard Spillett . Supermarket Asda has defended a 'wearable England flag' it has launched for the World Cup after claims it resembles a Ku Klux Klan outfit. The £3 St George’s Cross, with the word 'England' emblazoned across it, features a hood which Asda said was to allow fans to stay dry in the unpredictable British weather. But some fans took to Twitter today to point out the similarities between the hoods and those worn by the racist US organisation, also known by its initials 'KKK'. Asda customers say the new 'Wearable England Flag' looks like the notorious uniform of the Ku Klux Klan . The supermarket insists the outfit is merely designed to allow fans to watch England come rain or shine . One website user called Kieran posted a picture of himself at his @KieranCPhoto account, writing: 'Asda are selling wearable England flags, they look dodgy to say the least...' Another user called Simon replied on his account: ''ENGLAND RULES OKKK' Honestly, do Asda simply not bother to see how these things look when worn? *sigh*' The flag’s description on the Asda website simply says: 'Support England in the World Cup with this unique wearing flag!' A company . spokesman said it had also produced a wearable Brazilian flag ahead of . the competition, with starts in the South American country on June 12. Shoppers took to the Twitter today to point out the sinister similarity of the World Cup outfit . The spokesman said: 'We know there’s chatter on Twitter about our wearable World Cup flags, but it’s simply a flag with a hood - nothing more, nothing less. 'We opted for a hood on our wearable England and Brazilian flags as you never know what the British weather will bring. 'We want customers to get behind the team without getting wet.' In September last year, the supermarket giant was forced to make a £25,000 donation to the mental health charity Mind after apologising for advertising an 'mental patient fancy dress costume'. The costume - comprising a ragged, blood-spattered straitjacket and pictured being worn by a model covered in blood and brandishing a machete - was on sale for £20 through the supermarket's clothing arm George. Asda has dismissed the mocking tweets and insist the hood was merely added to keep fans dry . The Ku Klux Klan was a racist organisation set up in Tennessee, southern USA in 1866 to resist plans to create racial equality. Believing in white supremacy, the group's members terrorised leaders, both back and white, who called for greater integration. Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest was the first leader, or 'grand wizard', and presided over a hierarchy of 'grand dragons', 'grand titans' and 'grand cyclopses'. Members of the Ku Klux Klan at a cross burning in the 1960s, the organisation has since all but died out . Member's wore white costumes with masks and conical hats designed to scare opponents and hide their identities. After dying out in the 1870s, the group was reformed around 1915 and took up the sign of the burning cross at rallies. Partly fuelled by fears over immigration from the First World War and Russian revolution in Europe, the group swelled to its largest ever size of around 4million members in the 1920s. Despite a slight resurgance during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s, the group has slowly died away and is now thought to have fewer than 5,000 members.","Supermarket releases England flag outfit ahead of World Cup in Brazil .

"By . Corey Charlton . They are the neighbours from hell - a pair of loved-up randy peacocks shrieking loudly throughout the night. The birds mysteriously arrived in an inner city area of Manchester a few weeks ago and are keeping neighbours awake. Sleep-deprived locals have even called police to try and track down where they came from. And residents living on streets off Alexandra Road in Whalley Range say they are desperate to have them re-homed. Neighbour from hell: Local councillors are now looking at trying to re-home this lovemaking peacock and his partner in a nearby park . One resident said she thought the pesky bird pictured was beautiful, but it was just too loud . The two new residents have also become something of a Romeo and Juliet who are now inseparable - both day and night. Joan Barton, 73, said: 'It’s a blinking nuisance - I’ve been chasing it off my garage roof with a clothes prop.' Sleep deprived: Alexandra Road, in Whalley Range, Manchester, where the peacocks have been getting frisky . However they are an ill-tempered bird which doesn't mix well with other domestic birds. Paul Unslow-Leaver, 45, said: 'I’d just like them to go back to where they came from. The male peacock's tail feathers spread out in what is known as a feather 'train' which is more than 60 per cent of the bird's total body length. The feather train is used in mating rituals and for courtship. Females choose their mates based on the size, colour and quality of their prospective partner's feather train. Some males gather harems of several females, each of which will lay several eggs. They can be slightly ill-tempered, however, and don't mix well with other domestic birds. 'It’s driving the kids mad - it starts calling at 3am and by the time I get up for work at 5am it’s usually outside our back door. You just wouldn’t believe how loud it is.' Resident Eva Manley said they were 'beautiful birds but the peacock is just too loud'. 'The first time it let out a scream I’d come out into the garden and I just ran back inside. 'It starts at about 5am and just keeps going and going.' Neighbours first contacted police to try and trace the birds’ owners - but no reports of any lost peacocks had been made. Officers advised residents to contact the RSPCA - but the charity say they are unable to help because the birds are not sick or injured. Local councillors are now looking at whether the pair could be re-homed in nearby Alexandra Park. A male peacock's tail feathers are used during courtship and the more impressive its feather display, the more desirable it is.","Residents woken at all hours of the night since birds took over Manchester .

"By . Corey Charlton . and Dan Bloom . Sir Ben Ainslie won gold at the London Olympics but his new business proposal isn't quite so popular . Olympic gold medallist Sir Ben Ainslie has sailed into stormy waters with his plans to build a futuristic sailing headquarters. The development would include offices, meeting rooms, training and medical facilities and a car park. As well as his Olympic heroics, Ainslie helped the United States win . the America's Cup last year. He has submitted proposals for a high tower, . which would loom over neighbouring buildings at the Solent in Old Portsmouth, Hants. But the proposal has upset . residents of an upmarket waterfront area, with more than 200 attending a recent public meeting to discuss the proposal. And residents have banded together to fight the 25-metre high tower at the Camber dock. Malcolm Hill, chairman of a committee of opponents, said more than 200 people attended the public meeting at the Royal Naval Club with many speaking out about the plans. Mr Hill, who criticised Portsmouth City Council for rushing the planning permission process, said: 'I don’t like the way this has been railroaded through and taken as a fait accompli. 'The public seem to have been kept out of it. 'From the number of people at the meeting this clearly is a sensitive issue.' Another objector, Simon Martin, wrote: . 'My principal objection is to the height of the building which will be . 28 Metres in contravention to the Tall Building Policy. 'It is a monstrous carbuncle that needs drastic redesign to fit in with [planning] policies.' Portsmouth is home to the far higher Spinnaker tower, standing at a colossal 170 metres and one of the tallest buildings in Britain outside the capital. But resident Chris Ormes wrote: 'I remember when the Spinnaker was first suggested there was a choice of design. Where is the choice here!' He added: 'Like a lot of people I want what's best for the area that I have chosen to live in, and bringing work to the area is a good thing. Modern: An artist's impression of how the sailing centre would look - but it has upset many residents . Residents fear that if the building goes ahead it will tower over parts of old Portsmouth . Looming: Portsmouth also has the 170m Spinnaker tower (left), but an objector said that was better-planned . 'However, building a huge structure that will dwarf everything around it is not the answer. 'The . planners must remember that first and formost, this is in a . conservation area, and that brings many rules and regulations that we . all have to abide by.' 'It is a monstrous carbuncle that needs drastic redesign' - Portsmouth resident Simon Martin . Some, however, supported the plans. Resident Steve Harding said: 'As a Spice Island resident I fully support the proposed development. 'The contemporary building design will create an iconic statement and be a huge improvement over the unattractive industrial units and parking area. 'The development will be a great benefit to the Camber and a coup for the city of Portsmouth.' A Ben Ainslie spokesman said: 'We . understand everyone will have differing views on the design of the . building, some people are very positive with the modern design. 'Within Portsmouth there is a great mix . of old and new architecture that sits together well and this is a . further example of the same.' Detailed: The plans have been lodged with Portsmouth City Council and will be decided in August . Ainslie, pictured in 2011, went on to become the most successful sailor in Olympic history . Ainslie won a silver medal on . his Olympic debut as a 19-year-old at Atlanta in 1996 and went on to win . medals at the following four games. He is the most successful Olympic sailor in history.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Jailed: Constantin-Tiberiu Gheorge, 39, spent more than a year raiding a string of homes across London, Kent and Essex, leaving his fingerprints and blood at every scene . A Romanian burglar who left his DNA at every one of the 31 homes escaped capture because he was not on the police database. Constantin-Tiberiu Gheorge, 39, spent more than a year raiding a string of homes across London, Kent and Essex. But despite finding either his blood or fingerprints at the scenes, officers were powerless to identify Gheorge. The mystery sparked an urgent review by a specialist detection team, who identified Gheorge as a suspect. He was later arrested in Barking town centre. Today, he was sentenced to eight years in prison at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London. Gheorge, who pleaded guilty to all 31 burglaries, left at least one piece of DNA at every home. Officers became suspicious as they noticed the series of crimes - spanning 14 months - shared one single DNA profile. In most cases the suspect would leave DNA behind in the form of blood, but in some cases it was fingerprints. At an address in Kent, he left DNA and fingerprints. But despite having the suspect's DNA profile and fingerprints, the police could not match him to any of their records. The linked series was allocated to a specialist detection team where officers completed a review of the cases and analysis of all the information available. As a result Gheorge was identified as a suspect. On May 20 Gheorge pleaded guilty to 31 burglary offences at Snaresbrook Crown Court. Sentenced: Today the Romanian burglar was sentenced to eight years in jail after pleading guilty to 31 counts . Detective Sergeant Brett Hagen, from the detections team, said: 'Gheorge has to be one of the most prolific and yet one of the most careless burglars I have encountered. 'He has committed numerous offences across London, Kent and Essex with a blatant disregard for the victims and police alike. 'It is worth considering that for every one of these offences there was at least one victim who had to deal with the effects of becoming a victim of crime and where burglary is concerned the lasting effects run far deeper than a loss of property.'","Constantin-Tiberiu Gheorge, 39, spent 14 months raiding homes .

"By . Corey Charlton . It's notoriously difficult to get students excited about science but one teacher has found a winning formula - taking them to McDonalds. Caroline Molyneux has students flocking to her revision classes at weekends with her cunning combination of biology and fast food. Working from Sharples High School, Bolton, Greater Manchester, she said students can munch on ice creams, breakfast or lunch while they work through past papers. Caroline Molyneux (left) pictured during a study session with her students at McDonald's. She has been nominated for a prestigious national teaching award for her willingness to go the extra mile . 'We stage revision sessions in school and we started this one a month ago. It has been really successful. It is quite relaxed and informal and the pupils stay for quite a bit.' she said. 'Some have their breakfast or their lunch, and there are ice-creams on hand as we look through past papers.' And her somewhat unorthodox commitment to helping students study their biology GCSE papers has seen her shortlisted for an award. Her dedication to inspiring the next generation has her shortlisted for the prestigious 2014 School Biology Teacher of the Year Award - just one of three nominated nationwide. The science teacher is very popular with the students at Sharples High School, Bolton, Greater Manchester (pictured) for her commitment to helping them with their studies . The kids are lovin' the revision sessions at McDonald's, where they can grab a bite to eat while studying biology . The award recognises the 'very best and most inspiring biology teachers'. 'I was put forward for the award at my old school - Balshaw in Leyland,' she said. 'They kept it from me until I was shortlisted. I’m just one of three people - it was a big surprise. 'The assessors visited Sharples High School and spoke to the pupils - it is always nice to be nominated but it’s fantastic that this is because of student nominations.' The assistant headteacher has been . teaching for nine years, but has a background as a researcher at the . University of Molecular Microbiology. She now teaches biology, chemistry and astronomy and is an educational leader for the National Space Agency. She is also not scared to lay down a challenge: 'If anyone tells me they don’t like science, I will find out why. Here we make science exciting and interesting. 'Balshaw is an outstanding school and Sharples is on its way to being outstanding. I wanted to be part of that. 'I think teaching is a vocation, and not just a job. I love it and to support the children in helping them get the most out of their five years in school.' Dr Mark Downs, chief executive of the Society of Biology, said: 'Excellent teachers have a profound positive effect on their students’ learning, career choices and aspirations. 'It is rewarding to know that once again, the entrants for this award are teaching outstanding and innovative lessons which inspire their students.'","Students can grab a bite to eat at the 'relaxed and informal' study sessions .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Dennis Igo, 53, admitted 16 charges relating to making and possessing indecent images of children aged five. He has been spared jail . A businessman who spent four hours a day looking at his collection of more than a quarter of a million child porn images has been spared an immediate jail term. Dennis Igo, 53, of Bronington, near Wrexham, was in possession of at least 255,667 indecent still images and 834 videos, but was given a suspended prison sentence and 300 hours of community service. Now his MP Susan Elan Jones has slammed the sentence as 'pitiful and inadequate', and has written to Attorney General Dominic Grieve, demanding it be reviewed. Igo admitted 16 charges relating to making and possessing indecent images of children aged five to 14 between January 2006 and March . 2013 when he appeared before Mold Crown Court. The court was told he may have had many more images, but police did not have the resources to examine them all. Igo was given a suspended prison sentence and sent on a specialist internet sex offender course because of his 'exceptional circumstances'. It was accepted at Mold Crown Court that Igo, described as a successful businessman, became addicted to pornography when he suffered financial difficulties not of his making. He was said to have lost his life savings. Igo was also said to be 'in a very dark place' after his wife received treatment and surgery for breast cancer. The defendant told police that at the time he searched 'little breasts' on the internet, child porn sites appeared, and he started viewing them. He ended up being addicted - looking at them daily for up to three or four hours a day. Igo also admitted possessing extreme . images involved sexual intercourse between humans and animals, which . included horses and dogs. Nicholas Williams, defending, said . that his client had acted under stress and was relieved when the matter . was brought to an end by his arrest. MP Susan Elan Jones has slammed the sentence of man found with more than a quarter of a million child porn images as 'pitiful and inadequate' He had sought help and counselling and was motivated to tackle the root of his problems. The defendant was unable to explain why he had done it. Judge Niclas Parry told the defendant he had been viewing the suffering of abused children, but added there had been exceptional mitigating circumstances and that the probation service had taken the view that he could be safely managed in the community. He received a two-year prison sentence suspended for two years, and told to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work, as well as being placed on a supervision order. As a condition of this supervision, he must attend 36 sessions of an internet sex offender treatment programme. The judge also ordered him to register with the police as a sex offender for ten years and made a ten-year sexual offences prevention order (SOPO) to restrict his future conduct. One of the conditions bans him from downloading any images of children from the Internet. Ms Jones, Labour MP for Clwyd South, has asked the Attorney General for an urgent review of the sentence. In the letter, she said: 'Mr Igo has pleaded guilty to some extremely disturbing charges and I feel that the sentence awarded is totally inadequate when one considers the crimes that have been committed. 'I urge you to take action on this matter and to review this case in depth. On behalf of the victims involved in Mr Igo's 'collection' and the local community which I represent, I ask that you take whatever action is available to you to see that justice is done in this case.' Dennis Igo, 53, of Bronington, near Wrexham, was in possession of at least 255,667 indecent still images and 834 videos, but was given a suspended prison sentence and 300 hours of community service at Mold Crown Court. She later added: 'I have heard from many constituents in Bronington over the weekend and they are all as horrified as I am. It's relatively unusual for an MP to ask the Attorney General to review an individual case but I will not let this matter rest.' Ms Jones said she was horrified that the same judge recently gave a two-year custodial sentence for a currency scam, which she said seemed to be a discrepancy. 'It is extraordinary that there is no immediate custodial sentence is this case,' she said. 'There were well over a quarter of a million images - because of the numbers police could not extract them all - over seven years, involving a large number of films of children being abused. 'Many people in Bronington are very concerned and I can understand that. 'It makes you wonder who does get a custodial sentence.'","Dennis Igo, 53, admitted making and possessing indecent images .

"By . Steph Cockroft . CCTV shows Nurse Rui Li, 44, leaving Poole Hospital, Dorset, in her silver Porsche on Friday evening . Detectives investigating the disappearance of a 'reliable, professional and conscientious' nurse have released CCTV of her last known sighting. Rui Li, 44, was seen leaving Poole Hospital in Poole, Dorset, on the evening of May 23 before she was reported missing by her family on Tuesday morning. Police launched a murder inquiry after her car was found yesterday outside a property in Boscombe, Dorset. Now police have released CCTV showing Ms . Li driving out of the car park at Poole Hospital at exactly 6.17pm on . Friday - the last time she was seen. Her colleagues at Poole Hospital have . also today made a public appeal for information, describing Ms Li as 'a big . character' in their 'small close-knit team'. A 60-year-old Bournemouth man, who was arrested on suspicion of murder on Wednesday morning, remains in police custody. In the CCTV footage, Ms Li, who moved to the UK from China ten years ago, is seen driving a distinctive silver Porsche Boxster with the personalised number plate L1 RUI. Police and forensic experts are still examining a property near to where Ms Li's car was found, as well as two other houses in the nearby area. Detective Inspector Marcus Hester, who is leading the inquiry, said: 'It is still absolutely crucial for the investigation to establish what has happened to Ms Li between Friday evening and Tuesday morning. 'I am hoping this image of her distinctive car may jog people's memories. Did you see her driving home that evening? 'I am even interested to know if you saw the car moving around or being driven by anyone else over the Bank Holiday weekend. 'We are also building a better picture of her lifestyle, interests and friends. Ms Li was last seen leaving the hospital and was reported missing by her . family five days later. A . 60-year-old Bournemouth man arrested on suspicion of murder remains in . police custody . 'We know that she was a reliable and hardworking nurse at Poole Hospital, who was popular with her colleagues, and also that she enjoyed outdoors activities, including climbing. 'However, since moving to the UK from China around a decade ago, she has also led quite a private personal life. 'I am keen to speak to anyone who knows her well and would reassure them they are not breaking any trust by speaking to us.' Colleagues at Poole Hospital, where Ms Li worked, pictured above, described her as 'funny and unique' and have urged members of the public to come forward with information . Her colleagues from Poole Hospital have appealed for the public's help in tracking down the missing nurse. In a statement released by police, they said: 'Rui was a big character in our small close-knit team. 'Funny and so unique, she was totally reliable, professional and conscientious to a tee. She is terribly missed by all of us. Investigation: Police, who said they feared the nurse had 'come to some . harm', are now searching three addresses in the Boscombe area. Above, a . forensic team is pictured entering a house in the area today . 'Her nature was gentle and serene and that is part of the reason why we and the patients love her so much. 'If anybody knows anything please let the police know and help us find Rui.' Ms Li is described as a slim woman of Chinese appearance who is about 5ft 5ins. She sometimes wears glasses and often has her shoulder-length black hair in a ponytail, police said. Police said she came to the UK from China with her daughter around ten years ago and has worked as a nurse at Poole Hospital since April 2009. She currently works in the medical investigations unit. Her teenage daughter is now receiving close support from police family liaison officers, police said.","Released CCTV shows Rui Li, 44, leaving Poole Hospital, Dorset, on May 23 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Prostitution and drug dealing provide a £10billion boost to the economy, new research revealed today. Bizarre new European rules mean that for the first time illegal activities must be included in the official estimates of the size of the economy. It means a booming sex trade or an expansion in cannabis factories will provide a boost to George Osborne’s economic outlook. Illegal drug production and dealing accounts for £4.4billion of the UK economy while prostitution is worth £5.3billion to GDP, the ONS said . Every three months the Office for National Statistics produces an estimate of the size of the economy, or Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It covers every area of activity, from manufacturing and construction to agriculture, public services and tourism. However, from this autumn the figures will also have to include the value of illegal drugs and prostitution for the first time. It will cover the import, production and sale of illegal drugs and the ‘provision of prostitution services’ Based on 2009 levels, the prostitution is expected to add £5.3 billion to the economy and £4.4 billion attributable to illegal drugs. The new economic rules mean a booming sex and drugs trade would be good news for Chancellor George Osborne . In all years between 1997 and 2009 the impact ranges from £7 billion to £11 billion. The data will class growing drugs or importing them as ‘production’, buying them for home use as ‘expenditure’ and selling them as ‘income’. It covers crack cocaine, powder cocaine, heroin, cannabis, ecstasy and amphetamines. In a detailed briefing note, published today, the ONS examines how ‘UK cannabis production is not balanced’ because ‘domestic output increases by the value of sales and this is the increase in supply’. It adds: ‘Household final consumption expenditure (HHFCE) increases by the value of sales; less the value of electricity consumed, and intermediate consumption increases by the value of the seeds and planting stock and electricity used in production. ‘So there is “extra” demand equal to the value of the seeds and planting stock used. This is because we assume that the seeds and planting stock were previously recorded on the supply side but not the demand side.’ For prostitution, spending on renting brothels, and buying condoms and ‘working clothes’ will be classed under ‘production’. While some EU countries give a detailed breakdown of prostitution types such as ‘street’ and ‘escorts’, the UK is not able to do this with the data available. The ONS adds: ‘Extensive data gaps have been filled with assumptions, recognising that this area of the economy is very difficult to measure.’ It will look at the total number of men aged over 16 - the ‘size of the market’ - as well as rises in the cost of clothes, condoms and renting rooms. A raft of changes to GDP is expected to add a total of £33billion , or 2.3 per cent, in current prices in 2009. It includes changes to financial services, household spending, families buying brand new cars and people building their own homes.","New rules on calculating GDP come into force from September this year .

"By . Harriet Arkell . If you have £18million to spare and could do with a little more space, how about buying your own Cotswold village? The beautiful hamlet of Little Rollright, less than three miles outside Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire, boasts a Grade II-listed ten-bedroom manor, a Grade II-listed three bedroom rectory, and five additional cottages lying in an estate of 509 acres. Everything bar the Chapel is included in the sale of the village, which was previously owned by Oxford University's Lincoln College, and lies close to the megalithic monument, the Rollright Stones. Up for grabs (if you've got the cash): The picturesque hamlet of Little Rollright, less than three miles outside Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire, is for sale for £18million . The big house: The village is dominated by this Grade II-listed manor house, which has its origins in the 17th century and has ten bedrooms . Plenty of room: The dining room at the historic manor house has a huge open fire, stone-flagged floor, and large sash windows with views onto open countryside . It is dominated by a stone-built manor house, which dates back to the 17th century, since when it has been added to and modernised and turned into a substantial family home. The manor has a large kitchen and family room with windows on three sides and French doors opening onto a south-facing terrace.  There are ten bedrooms, a cinema, playroom, wine cellar, study, dining room, and a lift which provides access to the lower ground, ground and first floors. As well as the main house, Little Rollright also comes with a Grade II listed three-bedroom rectory, and five additional cottages. There are a number of traditional barns and outbuildings within the 509 acre estate. The land is currently made up of 82 acres of pastoral and 332 acres of arable farming and there are also 62 acres of woodland and a lake. The only thing which isn’t thrown in as part of the deal is the village chapel, which is owned by the Church of England. Little Rollright, which also has extensive farmland and a lake, lies between the picturesque Cotswold towns of Chipping Norton and Moreton-in-Marsh. It is only a few miles from the Four Shires Stone, which is the historic meeting point of Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire. The village is the closest village to the megalithic monuments of the Rollright Stones, which are thought to be older than Stonehenge and are believed go back more than 4,500 years. The sale of the village, which is being handled by upmarket estate agents Savills, includes everything - such as this lake - bar the Chapel, which is owned by the church . Also included: This Grade II-listed rectory is made of pretty local stone and has three bedrooms. Five cottages are also included in the price . The hamlet of Little Rollright lies near the ancient Rollright Stones, the origins of which remain unclear despite the efforts of several antiquarians . Additional accommodation: The pretty hamlet, which was once owned by Oxford University's Lincoln College, also comes with five cottages built from local stone . The village of Little Rollright used to be owned by Oxford University's Lincoln College, but has been owned by an anonymous British person for the last ten years . The church of St Philip in Little Rollright is the only building in the pretty Oxfordshire hamlet which is not for sale . If your budget for a new home is £18million but you'd rather stay within the M25, how about this detached house in sought-after Hampstead? Set on the lower slopes of Hampstead Village, Greenaway Gardens is considered the most prestigious road in the area, and this house, currently on the market with Savills, is one of the best. For £17,950,000 it offers 8,000sq ft , six bedroom suites, a 500-bottle wine cellar and 135ft west-facing garden designed by Chelsea Gold Medal winning designer, Bunny Guinness. You'll be closer to the shops, and probably won't get snowed in in the winter, but unlike Little Rollright, you might bump into your neighbours. They consist of a Neolithic stone circle known as ‘The Kings Men’ and a monolith known as ‘The Kings Stone’, with a further group of upright stones known as ‘The Whispering Knights’ which are believed to guard a 5,000 year old burial chamber. Chipping Norton, known as Chippy by locals, is famous for the media and politics set who live around it.  Prime Minister, David Cameron, Top Gear presenter, Jeremy Clarkson, and former Blur bassist, Alex James, are among the celebrities with homes nearby. Other neighbours include JCB heirs, the Bamfords, who have an organic farm at Daylesford, former tabloid editor Rebekah Brooks, and PR supremo, Matthew Freud and his wife, Elisabeth Murdoch. This house in Greenaway Gardens, Hampstead, is for sale for just under £18million . Little Rollright has been owned by an anonymous Brit for the past decade, and has gone on the market with Savills - at £18million, it is still £3million cheaper than a three-bedroom flat in One Hyde Park, central London. Giles Lawton, of Savills, said: 'It is a first for me, to be selling a village in the Cotswolds. It is a very special place and you would struggle to find something similar. 'The main home was a manor farmhouse and the owner has added a wing which was designed by Robert Adam. 'It is now a much more substantial home which has been beautifully done and really adds to the village. 'The old . rectory is a very pretty place and then you have the cottages as well. It is very rare to have a village for sale and it would suit anyone who . could afford it. 'It really is a wonderful place and we have already had a number of calls.' The . village dates back to at least 1086, when it featured in the Domesday . Book in the Shipton Hundred.  Then it had 17 households, made up of 12 . villagers, three smallholders and two slaves . Little . known because of its isolated position, it lies tucked between hills at . the end of a permissive road.  But for those who can afford it, Little . Rollright also represents a business opportunity, as much of the land . could be rented out. Research . from Knight Frank shows the average value of English farmland rose by . almost 6.5 per cent on the first three months of the year. It . now stands at £7,324 per acre - the first time prices have broken the . £7,000 per acre barrier. In the area around Little Rollright, land costs . £10,000 per acre. The most expensive country home sold this year was Shakenhurst, in Herefordshire which went for around £16 million. The drawing room at Little Rollright's manor house boasts a large bay window, wooden flooring and elegant fireplace, as well as original cornicing and picture rails . Glorious: The hamlet offers buyers with a spare £18million English countryside living at its most picturesque . Impressive space: There is also an orangery, where the new residents can while away the day gazing at their own rolling acres . Stunning countryside (and it looks like you'll get good phone reception, too): Little Rollright estate comes with 509 acres of Oxfordshire, including 62 acres of woodland . Privacy: Tucked away in the Cotswold countryside, the hamlet of Little Rollright would suit a buyer looking to hide away from the public gaze . Tranquil: The hamlet is an oasis of peace, but it has good transport links to London via mainline train services and the M40 . Lying just outside the village of Long Compton, on the border between Oxfordshire and Warwickshire, the Rollright Stones date back to the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, but despite several studies into the subject, their original purpose is still a mystery. Consisting of three monuments made . from oolitic limestone, they comprise the Whispering Knights, the King's . Men and the King Stone - and are thought to be older than Stonehenge. The . Whispering Knights is a large dolmen, a 5,000-year-old stone burial . chamber thought to have been part of a Neolithic long barrow. The . King's Men is a stone circle of 77 lumps of limestone dating back to . the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, and the King Stone is one . strangely-shaped stone, likened by some to a seal balancing a ball on its . nose. This owes its shape to 19th century drovers who chipped small . pieces off it to guard against the Devil. The Rollright Stones date back around 5,000 years and comprise three stone monuments: The Whispering Knights, the King's Men (pictured) and the King Stone . The name Rollright is thought to derive from the Old English 'hrolla landriht', meaning the land of Hrolla, but there are few facts known about the stones. While local legends suggested the stones were a king and his knights who were turned to stone by a witch, antiquarians in the 17th and 18th century suggested more feasible theories. Writing in 1743, antiquarian William Stukeley thought that they would have been part of a Druidic temple, while others suggested they were a memorial for Rollo the Dane.","The hamlet of Little Rollright lies less than three miles outside of Chipping Norton and comes with 509 acres of land .

Weapons: Mr Costello used these kitchen knives to stab the large bull terrier cross to death in his home . The incident unfolded on Wednesday when the dog climbed into Mr Costello's garden. He says he ran back into his house but his own pet Troy came out to protect him and the neighbour's animal grabbed it by the throat. The father-of-three then lifted two terracotta paving slabs from his patio and beat it over the head and when the fight spilled into the kitchen he grabbed a small vegetable knife and stabbed its back so many times the blade broke. He then got a bigger knife and stabbed him until the 'massive' white animal was dead. Mr Costello, of South Croydon, London, who worked for the Serious Organised Crime Agency and the homicide squad at the Metropolitan Police, said he had no choice. He said: 'All of a sudden, I could see this head poking over the fence - it was about the size of a lion's. 'It climbed over the fence and then started towards me. I could see it was going to attack me because it was coming at me with such force so I ran towards the house. 'I couldn't believe it when Troy just turned up out nowhere and totally intercepted the attack - getting mauled in the process. 'The dog was trying to rip Troy apart - it just went straight for the throat with its fangs and began biting. Gripe: The former detective says he saw the dog's head look over the fence before the alleged struggle . Death: After he smashed Monty repeatedly over the head the fight spread into the kitchen where the dog died . Violent: The terrier was stabbed with such force that the knife's blade broke in its chest . 'Troy tried to defend himself but it was clear the dog wasn't going to let go, so I picked up this massive paving slab and smashed it over the dog's back three times. 'Any other dog would've died but this one just kept going like it was possessed or something - the monster didn't even flinch. Brave: Troy rushed to defend his master, who says his dog would have certainly died had he not intervened . 'It just pulled Troy into the kitchen by his throat - leaving scrape marks on the floor - and I followed behind trying to figure out what to do. 'I hit the dog again with a paving slab, which smashed into three pieces, and got worried because it didn't do anything so grabbed a vegetable knife with a four inch blade. 'I just kept thinking 'this dog is going to kill Troy and then me' so I stabbed it about three or four times in the chest but the knife just snapped in half.' Mr Costello added: 'The whole thing must have only lasted for about five minutes but it felt like a lifetime because we were fighting for our lives - it might as well been a human who had come in. 'I was in a state of absolute shock. I spent 30 years on the police force and was in the murder squad for half of that and I have never been so terrified in my life and also never felt so alone. 'Thank God Troy was there because that monster would have killed me. The dog had to be killed in order for me to get help. I was completely and utterly terrified.' Just days before the attack on Wednesday, the dog - which Barry says is five times bigger than a normal Staffie - had already jumped into the garden and attacked Rottweiller Troy. Following the second attack Barry was left almost unharmed but his dog Troy received puncture wounds to his neck and side from bite marks. Dorothy Murray, whose grandson Regan Kelly owned the dog, said: 'We are all in complete shock. 'Monty was being used as a guard dog, which we didn't like so we rescued it about two years ago. 'On Wednesday, the dog just obviously got into the garden again and the man stabbed him. 'My grandson went berserk when we found out. There was no barking or any others signs to indicate there had been a struggle. 'Our dog might attack a cat or a dog like any pet might but you don't expect your neighbour to kill it. It's chilling really and we're very upset.' Damage: The former Scotland Yard officer smashed the dog over the head with tiles before stabbing it - sending blood over his home in Crowdon . The Metropolitan Police today confirmed they are investigating the incident. A spokesman said: 'Police were called on Wednesday 28 May, at approximately 12:15hrs to an address in Croydon to reports of an incident involving two dogs. 'It is believed that a dog came into the victim's back garden over a neighbour's fence. 'The victim - a man in his 50s - went inside his house, but his own dog has then become involved in a fight with the other dog. 'The victim tried to separate the dogs and has stabbed the dog (not his own dog), which later died. 'Police were called and the dog has been taken for examination to establish its breed-type. Enquiries continue. No arrests have been made at this stage.'","Barry Costello, 55, says bull terrier cross would have killed him and his pet .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . and Martin Robinson . This is the moment the habitual armed robber dubbed the Skull Cracker points his gun at the heads of staff as he robs a building society of almost £20,000 while on the run from open prison. Michael Wheatley, 55, was handed his 14th life sentence yesterday - but could be out again in ten years. He admitted holding up the Chelsea Building Society in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, four days after absconding from an open prison in Kent. He was already serving 13 life sentences at the time, and failed to return from day release on May 3.Scroll down for video . Violent: Skull Cracker Michael Wheatley as he pointed a gun at staff while robbing a building society while on the run from an open prison . Criminal: Wheatley, jailed for life again yesterday, did not even cover his face as he committed yet another robbery in early May . Wheatley - who pleaded guilty to three offences related to the robbery - was jailed again at Guildford Crown Court, but the minimum term was set at 10 years, which means he will be eligible for parole by 2024. On May 6 the manager of the building . society he robbed had warned staff to be on their guard, having seen the media . coverage of Wheatley's disappearance. He entered early the next morning, posing as a man who had spent 20 years in Ireland and wanted to open a new account. Jailed: Michael Wheatley, also known as the Skull Cracker, was given a 14th life sentence yesterday after pleading guilty to armed robbery . After . twice coming in and chatting to deputy manager Christopher Gurdev, he . was about to leave when he said 'one more thing"", prosecutor Dale . Sullivan told the court - 'At which point the defendant pulled out a . handgun from within his jacket and pointed it at Mr Gurdev's head'. The . court was played CCTV from the robbery, which showed Wheatley forcing . Mr Gurdev at gunpoint to unlock a door, take him into the back of the . branch and hand him cash from a safe while shouting 'Give me the money'. He also pointed the weapon at a female cashier. Mr . Sullivan said: 'The importance of the location of the robbery was that . the branch was robbed by the defendant some 13 years ago. 'The . manager had briefed her staff the night before about Wheatley, telling . them to be aware of him because of the media coverage and his failure to . return to Standford Hill'. All . but £850 of the money was recovered when Wheatley was arrested later . the same day, Mr Sullivan said, but the gun, real or imitation, was . never found. He was captured on May 7 after four days on the run from the Category D Standford Hill prison on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent. During the Surrey raid he pointed a handgun at staff and made off with £18,350 - but was captured by police hours later in Tower Hamlets, East London. Yesterday he pleaded guilty to robbery, possession of a firearm or imitation firearm while committing an offence, and being unlawfully at large. The court heard that he previously robbed the same building society branch 13 years ago and staff had been told to be on their guard following his disappearance. The court heard that Wheatley has spent a total of 46 years in institutions, starting at the age of six, and has been in prison on and off for most of his adult life. Crime: Wheatley returned to a building society he had robbed 14 years ago, the court heard. The above CCTV still shows one of his armed robberies from the original spree in the early 2000s . Appearing . via video-link from HMP Belmarsh in south east London, he showed no . emotion and sat with his arms folded as Judge Christopher Critchlow . passed sentence. Judge . Critchlow said it was a 'special case' because of Wheatley's prolific . record of violent armed robberies and committing offences after being . released from prison sentences. Passing . sentence, the judge told him: 'You went to the same branch which you . robbed in about 2001. You therefore deliberately targeted this branch . and planned this raid. 'You knew exactly what you were doing, having committed such crimes so many times. It is clear the public must be protected from you for a long time.' The . court heard that Wheatley has 23 previous convictions for robbery, two . for attempted robbery and 18 for related firearms offences. He was given his nickname after pistol-whipping innocent bystanders during previous robberies, including a 73-year-old woman. Wheatley was sentenced on the basis that it was an imitation firearm. In cuffs: Wheatley is pictured above arriving at South East Surrey Magistrates' Court earlier this month . Lionel Blackman, defending, said Wheatley went on the run after being refused parole after almost eight years in prison and then again last October. He told the court Wheatley had been having therapy in prison in between parole attempts and had not applied while getting help. But the therapy to deal with abuse he suffered as a child was stopped because of funding cuts last July, the court heard. After his second failed parole attempt he was downgraded and moved to the Category D open prison. Mr Blackman told the court: 'This is a case where a man has spent 46 of his 55 years in one institution or another'. He continued: 'He was very much left to his own devices in the open prison. Not seeing on the horizon another opportunity to determine his release and disappointed not to achieve a release at seven and a half years or in October, he made the decision not to return to prison at all. 'The plan was to start a new life in Ireland. Regrettably he committed a robbery to fund that new life'.","Michael Wheatley, 55, admitted holding up a bank in Surrey while on the run .

"By . Bianca London . A teenager has launched an app that could spell the end for the school run chaos. It allows users to search for their children's school and co-ordinate with parents making similar journeys. The app, called ecomumy, is available to download from iTunes and Google Play and is the brainchild of Andrew Christopher, 17, from Morden, south west London. Brains behind the brand: A new app called ecomumy is the brainchild of 17-year-old Andrew Christopher . He said he came up with the idea after watching 4x4 cars with a seven-seater capacity carrying just three passengers during his slow journey to school. He said: 'When I travelled to school I would always notice there was a lot of congestion so I wondered if there was a way to resolve this issue and reduce traffic congestion as well as CO2 emissions. 'I would like all the schools in Merton to come forward on the idea of ecomumy so they can use it as a model and help the environment.' The app is described as: 'Enabling parents to network with fellow mumys and to be part of a group of around 2-4 people to minimise the numbers of school rounds they do weekly, thereby freeing themselves for few full days in a week and reducing the traffic flow. 'The mumys of a same school or even adjacent schools have the potential to network themselves and work together sharing the school rounds with other mumys of the same or adjacent schools. 'The key part of the application is the schedule for small groups being created, which is known as the WeeklyRound. 'A mumy can either join with an already existing WeeklyRound or create a new WeeklyRound and wait for others to approach her and join hers. In each WeeklyRound an average of three mumys can join and work together sharing the school rounds.' Clever: Andrew came up with the ecomumy idea when he was just 15 . Handy: The app allows users to search for their children's school and co-ordinate with parents making similar journeys . Andrew, who is preparing for maths, physics, history and chemistry AS-level exams at King's College School, Wimbledon, said he got into graphic design after designing the website of his father's company. He said: 'My dad's company bought an Adobe Creative Suite kit and I wanted to try it out. One of his employees taught me when I was 10 and from there I started to self-teach.' So simple: Andrew got into graphic design after designing the website of his father's company and his new app is easy to use . After coming up with the idea for ecomumy aged 15, he made a story board, mapping out how the app would function, and sent it to developers in India. He has also submitted it into the Chest competition - a European Union-led initiative inviting innovators to propose solutions to key social challenges . The ambitious teenager said his entry into the tech world is not yet the start of a career and he hopes to study engineering at university.","ecomumy helps parents arrange groups to organise the school run .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Scampie the two-year-old white poodle got a nasty shock when he cocked his leg by a lamp post on his daily walk - and was hurled across the street metres by a blast of electricity. The pet was being walked through Swindon, Wiltshire, by his owner Ernest Reid, 68, when he was caught out by the faulty post. Scampie was thrown three metres by the force of the shock and had to be rescuing quivering from the street by his concerned owner, who feared his dog could have died in the accident. Zapped: Scampie the poodle, pictured, was hurled three metres after marking his territory on a lamppost in Swindon . Cautious: Since the shock, Owner Ernest Reid, 68, says Scampie is nervous on walks - and fears he could have died from the blast . Mr Reid, a retired electrical engineer, was walking his dog at around 10pm and says he remembers smelling burning - but did not make the connection that fried electrics in the lamp post could be to blame. He said: 'He was walking alongside me, like he always does. He stopped at the lamp post for a wee and then he let out a yelp. 'I turned around and as I did so I saw Scampie being thrown across the path and he landed on the grass about three metres away. 'At first I assumed he had sat on a hedgehog. We get quite a lot of them around here so I thought that is what had happened. 'But then I realised he had been electrocuted'. It is thought a burning moped had earlier been up against the pole, causing the electrical wires to fuse and short circuit. Mr Reid continued: 'He didn't appear to have any physical injuries - but he was shaking and squealing and he would not move from the grass. Hurled: The force of the shock threw Scampie three metres across the street . Walkies: Scampie near the offending lamppost in Swindon, with his owner Ernest Reid, 68 . 'When I shone the light onto the lamp post there was quite a lot of smoke and I could tell it had shorted. 'I took him to the vets and they said he was OK but I'm still a little worried so I am going to take him back for a check up. 'He's . only just starting to return to his normal self, his tail is wagging . and he is quite happy but he's still not as happy as he used to be and . he won't go near metal lamp posts any more. 'I thought the smell was just someone burning rubbish on the allotments. I should have known but I couldn't place it. 'I didn't know what the smell was until Scampie got the shock and I suddenly remembered it was an electrical short. Complaint: Mr Reid says he is yet to receive an apology for the council over how the lamppost was allowed to become electrified and dangerous . 'On our way back from the walk I shone a torch along the lamp-posts and there was smoke coming out of them. 'He . will only really walk on the side of the grass now. I reported it to . the local council but I still haven't heard a word back from them - let . alone an apology. 'If . I had leaned against the post. I could have been killed. I have angina . so I'm not sure I would have even been able to survive 240 volts through . my body. 'I will be sending the council my vets bills'. Scottish & Southern Energy said they were aware of the incident and had fixed the lamp post. A spokesman said: 'We were called shortly after midnight on May 17 by Swindon Council and we were advised that there had been an incident involving the electrocution of a dog. 'We responded within half an hour of the report and it was made safe'. Swindon Council has been contacted for comment.","The two-year-old pet was electrocuted on a walk in Swindon, Wiltshire .

"By . Neil Ashton . Follow @@neilashton_ . Steven Gerrard has hit back at former England team-mate Paul Scholes after he claimed Wayne Rooney should face the axe at the World Cup. Scholes questioned whether Roy Hodgson had the nerve to drop Rooney if he failed to deliver at his third World Cup. But Gerrard claimed Rooney is in peak condition as England prepare for Friday night's clash with Peru at Wembley. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney with fully charged sliding tackle on John Stones . Wrong: Steven Gerrard doesn't agree with Paul Scholes' claims that Rooney should be axed at the World Cup . Doubts: Scholes questioned whether Roy Hodgson has the nerve to drop Rooney (pictured) Former star: Scholes played 67 times for England between 1997 and 2004, scoring 14 goals including this one against Croatia at Euro 2004 . The England captain said: ‘Paul Scholes is wrong. He’s been Manchester United’s best player at home and in Europe. He’s been in terrific form. What I’ve seen from his performances in the United team, he’s been really positive. ‘He’s in a better frame of mind going into this tournament than he’s had going into previous tournaments when he’s had injuries.’ Hodgson agreed: ‘Of course I don’t think he’s past his best. I’ve selected him in a 23-man squad that I’m very proud of. I believe in Wayne Rooney, he’s still a young man.’ Rooney starts up front for England on Friday evening in a strong line-up before the squad travels to Miami on Sunday and Hodgson says he wishes he could bottle the team spirit and use it against Italy in the opening group game. ‘I’m looking at the three matches, I suppose. I’m affected by this being our last game in England, a massive crowd and a huge responsibility, so it’s not an experimental team. ‘If I could bottle what I am seeing at the moment and keep it like that and release it on June 14 I’d be a happy man. Our job is to be in peak condition on June 14. I couldn’t have wished for a better week. Pointing the way: Rooney will start up front for England in the friendly against Peru at Wembley on Friday . ‘I’ll lean on the players who have done the job for us up to now against Peru. I can experiment more in Miami. ‘I want to see a good performance. The players want to give a good performance. ‘I’m very pleased that such a big crowd will see us off at Wembley but I’d be lying if I said I had a specific goal for the Peru game and the next two. Our goal is to gain experience in the next three games and give  everyone game time.’ Pleased: England boss Hodgson is happy with the progress his side are making ahead of the World Cup . Southampton left back Luke Shaw will probably have to wait for his second cap as he has a head cold. Gerrard starts and is expected to be partnered by his Liverpool team-mate Jordan Henderson. Jack Wilshere, just returning to fitness, will play in the second half. Raheem Sterling and Adam Lallana will be given chances to win starting places against Italy but Hodgson has yet to decide whether to start them together in a 4-2-3-1 formation.
