"Feast away: Scientists have found overeating will not affect blood sugar levels in people who exercise . A short daily workout now could combat over-eating and days of lazing about at Christmas, scientists claim. Research has shown a short period of indulgence can cause long-term effects on the body. But a new study released today revealed this can be countered by 45 minutes of exercise a day in the run up to the festive season - even if the amount of calories consumed is significantly more than those burned off. Experts at the University of Bath found exercising during a time of excess can stabilise blood sugar levels and prevent damage to metabolism. In a group of 26 healthy young men, half of them only exercised daily on a treadmill for 45 minutes, while the other half remained entirely inactive. All of the participants were told to overeat. Those who did not exercise increased their calorie intake by 50 per cent and the others consumed 75 per cent more. But after one week, the non-exercising group's blood sugar levels fell into an unhealthy decline, while those doing a daily workout showed no side effects from the extra food. Metabolism also slowed in the men that did not exercise, the study showed, as the genes in their fat cells were not adequately activated to process the sizable meals. Dr Dylan Thompson, senior author of the paper, published in the Journal of Physiology today, said: 'We . matched the energy surplus between groups, so the exercising group . consumed even more and were still better off at the end of the week. 'If you are facing a period of over-consumption and inactivity this Christmas, then our study shows that a daily bout of exercise will prevent many of the negative changes in the way in which your body handles sugar, even if you do still gain weight.' Solution: Study found we can indulge in peace if we do a short daily bout of exercise in the run up to Christmas . Dr James Betts, one of the researchers who worked on the study, added: 'This new research shows that the picture is more sophisticated than ""energy"" alone. Exercise has positive effects even when we are actively storing energy and gaining weight.' Dr Jean-Philippe Walhin, also from the university, added: 'Short-term overfeeding and reduced physical activity had a dramatic impact on the overall metabolic health of the participants and on various key genes within fat tissue. 'However, even though energy was still being stored, regular exercise prevented many of the long-term negative changes from taking place.'","Exercising 45 minutes a day a week before Christmas could be enough .

"Cristiano Ronaldo became the joint third highest scorer in Real Madrid’s history on Sunday night with his 290th goal for the club in a 2-0 win over Elche. The victory put Real four points clear of Barcelona who slipped up 24 hours earlier against Malaga and it also moved Ronaldo up another notch on Madrid’s all-time goals list. Across almost two decades Spain international striker Santillana scored 290 goals in 645 games from his debut in 1971. Cristiano Ronaldo clenches his fist in celebration after scoring Real Madrid's second goal of the night against Elche . Elche players look on with frustration after Karim Benzema was found with the simplest of tasks to tap home into an empty net to make it 1-0 . Benzema expresses his delight after giving the Spanish giants the lead against relegation-threatened Elche . The forward duo celebrate after the France striker (left) scored the opening goal for Real against Elche on Sunday night . Carlo Ancelotti took charge of his 100th competitive match of Real Madrid in the 2-0 win against Elche . Elche (4-4-1-1): Tyton; Suarez, Roco, Lomban, Edu Albacar; Rodriguez, Adrian ( Herrera 81), Pasalic (Galvez 75), Niguez (Mendes Rodrigues 64) ; Fajr; Jonathas. Subs not used: Herrera Yague, Cisma, Corominas, Gimenez Candela. Real Madrid (4-3-3): Casillas; Carvajal, Pepe, Varane, Marcelo; Lucas Silva (Illarramendi 84), Kroos, Isco (Arbeloa 89); Bale, Benzema (Jese 93), Ronaldo. Subs not used: Navas, Hernandez, Nacho, Medran . Scorers: Benzema 56, Ronaldo 69 . It has taken Ronaldo just 281 games to match that total and he is now only 15 goals from second placed top scorer Alfredo Di Stefano and 33 behind all-time leader Raul. All that after coming into the game on a run of three league games without a goal – he has never gone four matches without scoring since joining the club and that record stays in tact. He had four chances inside the first 20 minutes. He almost scored after just five minutes when from Karim Benzema’s pass he hit the Elche bar. He then had a shot from the edge of the area that Przemysław Tyton saved. That was followed by a long crossfield pass from Marcelo which he pulled back across the face of the goal instead of sending goalwards. And then on 19 minutes came the best chance of the half. Gareth Bale crossed from the right and inexplicably Ronaldo directed his effort back away from goal. On another day he would have had a first half hat-trick. The last opportunity of the four owed everything to Bale, so much for the selfish former Spurs forward. He was causing Elche problems down their left and Edu Albacar was booked for upending him. Benzema went one better than Ronaldo shortly before the break when he did put the ball in the net but the linesman’s flag cruelly ruled it out. Bale was again the architect crossing from the right. Benzema connected brilliantly with an overhead kick that gave Tyton no chance but despite appearing to be level with the last defender he was penalised for offside. Ancelotti (left) and star man Ronaldo (right) show their delight after Real scored their second goal of the evening . Iker Casillas applauds the travelling supporters on what was his 500th La Liga appearance for Real Madrid on Sunday night .

The 27-year-old's (left) superb bicycle kick was ruled out for offside in the first half . 1. Raul - 323 goals . 2. Alfredo Di Stefano - 305 goals . 3. Ronaldo - 290 goals . With Real Madrid unable to get themselves in front having dominated the first half Elche came out with plenty of self-belief for the second period. Iker Casillas – making his 500th La Liga appearance for Real Madrid – palmed away Aaron Niguez’s shot. The midfielder’s next contribution to the game should have been his last. He went through Bale with a red card challenge on the Welshman’s ankle that merited far more than the yellow card he was shown. Both feet were off the ground, the studs were up and Bale was lucky to be able to carry on. With the referee letting off Niguez and Benzema’s brilliance denied its reward in the first half it seemed the luck was against Real Madrid but on minute 56 thing fell the way of Ancelotti’s team at last. Former Madrid forward Bale (left) fires an attempt on goal for Madrid during a below-par first-half showing from Carlo Ancelotti's men . Bale's shot fails to trouble Polish keeper Tyton - on a season-long loan from PSV - as the hosts held out during a goalless first half . Raul (1994-2010) 323 goals 741 appearances . Alfredo Di Stefano (1953-1964) 305 goals 392 appearances . Cristiano Ronaldo (2009-present) 290 goals 281 appearances . Carlos Santillana (1971-1988) 289 goals 645 appearances . Ferenc Puskas (1958-1966) 242 goals 262 appearances . Ronaldo’s cross was intercepted by former Barca B defender David Lomban but he cleared it straight at keeper Tyton and it run into the path of Benzema who swept it over the line from close range. It was no more than he and Madrid deserved. The goal relaxed Real Madrid but not Ronaldo who missed another chance this time from a Bale pass. Could he really go four league games without a goal? He answered the question emphatically on 69 minutes to put the game beyond doubt. Isco ran on to Marcelo’s pass and skipped past Damian Suarez before planting a cross on Ronaldo’s head. There was still work for Real Madrid’s top scorer to do but with a bullet header he gave Tyton no chance. He might have scored a second a minute later but was wrestled to the ground by Enzo Roco who also escaped with a yellow card. Elche somehow had finished with 11 men on the pitch but had been beaten none the less. Ancelotti once said that having Ronaldo on the pitch was like starting one goal in front. The Italian coach had picked up three points on his 100th game in charge of Real Madrid, his record breaking striker had made sure of it.

"Cristiano Ronaldo has been asked by Nike to withdraw a line of trainers from his recently launched footwear collection because they competed directly with the American sportswear giant who pay him around £5.5m a year in sponsorship. In collaboration with Portuguese company Portugal Footwear, Ronaldo launched the new line called CR7 Footwear at recent Milan and Las Vegas fashion fairs and the collection included sports shoes.

"Real Madrid supporters booed coach Carlo Ancelotti and goalkeeper Iker Casillas but saw their team win 2-0 against Deportivo to stay clear at the top of La Liga. There were even a few jeers for an out-of-sorts for Cristiano Ronaldo when he blasted a second half free-kick over but the Ballon D’Or set up the second for Karim Benzema after Isco had scored the first. The worst whistles were reserved for Ancelotti and Casillas and were audible when the team and managers’ names were announced before kick-off. Casillas’ error had cost Real Madrid the opening goal seven days earlier in the 4-0 derby day defeat to Atletico Madrid and Ancelotti was criticised for his team selection but as with most of the abuse levelled at Real players from their own fans – most recently to Gareth Bale – it was incomprehensible especially as it came at the start of the game and seemed to help ensure Madrid made a nervous start. Real Madrid midfielder Isco (left) opened the scoring with a curled finish from Alvaro Arbeloa's pass in the first-half . Karim Benzema follows the ball into the net after doubling Real Madrid's lead to complete a 2-0 victory . Real Madrid superstars celebrate as they move four points clear of arch rivals Barcelona at the top of La Liga . Real Madrid (4-3-3): Casillas; Arbeloa, Varane, Nacho, Marcelo; Kroos, Illarra (Silva), Isco (Carvajal); Bale, Benzema (Jese), Ronaldo. Substitutes: Navas, Derik, Medran, Chicharito. Booked: Nacho, Arbeloa . Scorers: Isco 22', Benzema 73' Deportivo (4-2-3-1): Fabricio; Laure, Pablo, Lopo, Luisinho; Bergantinos, Borges (Dominguez); Cuenca, Perez (Medunjanin), Cavaleiro; Riera (Costa). Substitutes: David, Canella, Wilk, Lopez. Booked: Borges, Pablo, Lopo, Laure . Casillas at least wasted no time in responding to the boo-boys with a fine save at his near-post from Isaac Cuenca. The former Barcelona winger tested the home defence on several occasions in the first 15 minutes. For Madrid, Ronaldo hit the bar and Bale then charged through to the edge of the area and did likewise with a ferocious shot. The Welshman turned provider next with a cross that Benzema should have done better with but allowed Fabricio to push away for a corner. When Real finally took the lead on 23 minutes it was from Isco just inside the area immediately after Ronaldo had missed from much closer in. He failed to finish from a yard out from Benzema’s cross and Isco saved the day with a curling shot into the far corner when it looked as if Deportivo had cleared the danger. It was a boost for the team but Ronaldo's miss did nothing to improve his state of mind. He had made an uncharacteristically quiet start to the game after a tumultuous week when the celebration of his 30th birthday party had made almost as much news as Madrid’s derby-day defeat that came just hours before it. Bale was comfortably Real Madrid’s best performer in the first half and his run and cross gave Ronaldo the chance to make it two but he headed over. There was one moment of brilliant skill from Ronaldo who turned Deportivo’s 39-year-old full-back Manuel Pablo inside out but it was Bale who finished the half strongly crossing from the right only for team-mates to again fail to capitalise.

If Real had started to look more convincing at the end of the first half that was all forgotten at the start of the second with Deportivo hitting the post from Celso Borges and Casillas making a fine save down to his left from Wigan loanee Oriol Riera. The jeers for the keeper at the start of the game were now replaced with applause. He was keeping Real Madrid in the game. Goalscorer Isco had to intervene at the back post to break down another visitors’ attack. And Ronaldo’s afternoon was getting no better as he blasted a free-kick over the bar from the edge of the area and there were even a few jeers for the three-times Ballon d’Or winner. Real Madrid brought on winter window signing Lucas Silva for Asier Illaramendi with 20 minutes left and immediately got the second goal. Ronaldo played Benzema in and he scored with a first-time shot over the advancing Fabricio. Jese Rodriguez came on for Benzema and set-up Ronaldo now playing at centre-forward. The Portuguese sent the chance wide smashing the turf in frustration at the miss. Madrid stay top with the win and remain Champions League favourites ahead of this week’s trip to Germany to play Schalke but the mood has changed considerably since the group stages when they and their talisman Ronaldo looked invincible.

"Diego Simeone was at it again on Saturday – conducting the crowd as his team made fools of their richer rivals Real Madrid. His achievements at Atletico Madrid have been little short of astounding at times but could he really transfer the magic to Manchester City? Here, Sportsmail looks at the pros and cons of hiring one of the most charismatic, occasionally combustible, and highly successful coaches in football. Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone has been linked with the manager's role at Manchester City . Mario Mandzukic (left) and his Atletico team-mates celebrate during the 4-0 win against Real Madrid . JUST WHAT CITY NEED? How many times have Manchester City looked long on talent but short on belief and passion? Speaking on Spanish radio last week Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino said they were ‘the most gifted team in the league’ but that Chelsea ‘did more with less’. Simeone is the master of motivation. He lifts his players for big games like the Spanish Cup final in 2013 when he beat Jose Mourinho’s Real Madrid at the Bernabeu, and in the Europa League the year before when he beat Marcelo Bielsa's Athletic Bilbao. But he can also maintain that energy throughout a whole season? Atletico Madrid’s players always believed they had a chance in the Champions League last season because over two legs they feel they are a match for anyone. But they doubted that in a 38-game season they could really get the better of the superior squads of Real Madrid and Barcelona. And yet, Simeone convinced them, and they won the most difficult competition of the lot. If what City need is a little more passion then La Liga’s Mr Motivator could be Manuel Pellegrini's perfect successor. Simeone's side claimed the Europa League in 2012 after beating Athletic Bilbao in the final in Bucharest . FORTRESS ETIHAD . With 12 points already dropped at home, teams don’t go to the Etihad with fear and it shouldn’t be that way against the league champions. In La Liga in contrast, nobody wants to go to the Vicente Calderon where Real Madrid have already lost three times this season. But much of that comes from the special bond that exists between Simeone and the Aletico Madrid supporters - something that would be difficult to replicate in Manchester. He turned up in high regard as a former captain and double winner and in any player-manager dispute he will always have the 60,000 home fans on his side. That instant loyalty would not be available to him away from Madrid. He probably wouldn’t get away with having his son Guiliano as a ball-boy jumping into his arms whenever City scored. He could try to bring the old Maine Road passion back to City, but he would have to get the team playing well first before anyone started jumping up and down to the tune of 'Ole! Ole! Ole! Cholo Simeone'. Manuel Pellegrini has struggled with Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in recent weeks . Simeone would have to get used to not having 60,000 fans chanting his name at first . TO BUILD AND REBUILD . Last summer he had to watch Thibaut Courtois go back to parent club Chelsea and Diego Costa and Filipe Luis follow him to Stamford Bridge. He didn’t complain, just built another indestructible side that plays exactly the same way. On Saturday in the derby he had midfield journeymen like Tiago and Gabi out-performing World Cup winners like Sami Khedira and Toni Kroos. Under his wing Diego Godin has emerged as one of the best central defenders in Europe. Mario Mandzukic – lost at Bayern Munich – has found his best form again. And he can handle big signings too as the success of the £22.2m acquisition Antoine Greizmann and previously Radamel Falcao prove. He would have no problem working with City sporting director Txiki Begiristain and making the transfers work. Antoine Griezmann's big-money signing proves Simeone can handle himself in the transfer market . Radamel Falcao also impressed after joining Atletico under the Argentine . THE LANGUAGE BARRIER . Simeone speaks very little English. And even if he learned the language quickly something would inevitably be lost in translation. Part of the spell he casts over supporters and staff alike comes from the way he expresses himself. Speaking through an interpreter as Pochettino did in his first season or in the broken sentences of a novice, some of the power of his message would be watered down. His fitness coach, the brilliant Oscar Ortega, would have similar problems as would his trusted No 2 Mono Burgos. It would certainly be an obstacle, but not an insurmountable one. TACTICS . Forget the idea his teams don't play football. Real Madrid were played off the park on Saturday with flicks, tricks and bicycle-kicks all part of the show. His teams are compact when defending and attack as a unit but he is bold enough to take chances when the time is right to do so. Falcao and Costa have enjoyed playing for him. He wants defensive solidity but full backs can overlap as Guilherme Siqueira did in the Madrid derby to make the second goal. He's not a fan of possession for possession's sake. He's even said that too much of it can be a negative because it allows the opposition to regroup. He likes to hurt teams with the ball, not just have it for the sake of it. It's a philosophy that fits the Premier League perfectly. Diego Godin celebrates after scoring against Barcelona in La Liga last season as Atletico won the title . A GAMBLE WORTH TAKING? IT WOULD BE FUN FINDING OUT . Seeing the Man in Black in the dugout going up against Arsene Wenger or Jose Mourinho, Sam Allardyce or Tony Pullis would give the Premier League a shot in the arm, the like of which it hasn’t had since the self-proclaimed Special One first showed up in 2004. Simeone’s high energy man-management would shake up the City dressing room, his high-intenstiy football would shake up the league, and his touchline passion would shake up the fourth official from time to time. It wouldn’t be without its glitches – the team-talks might have to be delivered via Sergio Aguero at first – but it would be a rollercoaster ride and if this season comes to a crawling climax with no trophies you could see why it might be one City's power-brokers might want to take.

"Until she opened her mouth, the young blonde sat demurely in the audience of BBC1’s latest edition of Question Time. But as the thorny topics of an EU exit and immigration controls were debated, the camera swung to Amy Rutland, who launched a personal attack on the UKIP panellist, the Eastleigh candidate Diane James, calling her ‘disgusting’. Miss Rutland, a politics graduate, claimed UKIP preyed on vulnerable people by ‘scaremongering’ about the number of Romanians and Bulgarians expected to come to Britain. Scroll down for video .

Now it has emerged that the 23-year-old from Margate in Kent is a diehard Labour supporter and her presence on last week’s show has prompted dozens of complaints. She is a regional policy co-ordinator for the party, campaigned at the Eastleigh by-election in which UKIP came second to the Lib Dems and even spent the afternoon before the QT screening last Thursday in Dover at a meeting to talk about education policy with Labour MP Stephen Twigg, who was also on the panel. As complaints arrived at the BBC from viewers – there have been 90 so far – Miss Rutland clearly considered her performance a triumph. She sent a tweet before the programme aired (it is recorded an hour ahead of the viewing time) boasting: ‘Don’t miss out on Question Time tonight, you’ll see me rip into the disgusting UKIP woman!’ Controversial: The Question Time appearance of Amy Rutland, second from right, resulted in a number of complaints and angry tweets, accusing the Labour Party of 'planting' her in the audience . Attack: Miss Rutland went all out against UKIP's Diane James, pictured on the Eastleigh by-election campaign trail with party leader Nigel Farage, branding her 'disgusting' and accused UKIP of 'scaremongering' Right to reply: Question Time presenter David Dimbleby, demanded Diane James to answer Miss Rutland's allegation that she was 'disgusting' Those pitching for an audience place in the programme are asked which political party they would vote for if there was an election tomorrow, what their views are on the EU, whether they are a member of a political party – and if so which one, and about their ethnic background. The 150 who appear on the show are picked from 500 applications. Last week there were outraged tweets from the public when Miss Rutland’s political allegiance became known. Many voiced suspicions she was a Labour Party ‘plant’ and deliberately given air time by the BBC. Others rounded on Mr Twigg – who alluded to Miss Rutland during the programme as ‘the questioner in the audience’ – accusing him of being disingenuous by disguising the fact he knew the activist. By Sunday night Miss Rutland's Twitter account had been closed down to all but her followers. Campaigner: There is no doubt about where Miss Rutland's political allegiance lie, and she took part in the Labour effort in Eastleigh in the recent by-election where Diane James candidated for UKIP . Proud: Miss Rutland, whose Twitter account has since been set to private, tweeted this about her appearance on question time last Thursday . Campaigning: The politics graduate is pictured, far right, at the Eastleigh by-election vote count . A photograph showing her with a Labour Party backdrop had been replaced by one of her smiling in what appears to be a coffee bar. At her home, where she lives with her mother, Sheila, she was keeping her own counsel. Her mother said: ‘Amy is quite upset. She doesn’t want to talk. If you want anything you will have to go to the Labour press office.’ A BBC spokesman said QT attracted audience members who were ‘very interested’ in politics and it was natural that some people would have political affiliations. He added: ‘The programme was chaired fairly and impartially.’ This is not the first time QT has courted controversy. In 2001, the then US ambassador to Britain, Philip Lader, struggled to hold back his tears in the face of a brutal attack by audience members in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. The debacle prompted Greg Dyke, then the BBC’s director general, to publicly apologise.","Labour activist Amy Rutland, 23, attacked UKIP candidate on Question Time .

"The sight of a blue-clad No 8 breaking late into the box to finish off a flowing move is a familiar one at Stamford Bridge – but on Saturday things were a little different. A week on from when Frank Lampard showed his former employers what they were missing  at the Etihad, Brazilian midfielder Oscar is going some way to making up for his absence. The 23-year-old is still far from the finished product, as shown by Jose Mourinho’s decision to drop him in that title clash with Manchester City, but  in his showings against Bolton and Aston Villa he is starting to demonstrate the performance levels that his manager demands. Oscar scored against Aston Villa on Saturday with a Frank Lampard-esque burst into the box . Lampard himself was at it again on the weekend as he scored in Manchester City's 4-2 win against Hull . Oscar, in the Chelsea No 8 shirt vacated by Lampard, takes on Aston Villa's Alan Hutton on Saturday . Lampard (here challenging Didier Drogba last season) made the Chelsea No 8 shirt his own . Chelsea legend Lampard was never frightened to go for goal from range – but Oscar has actually scored more from outside the box in his first 25 goals for the Blues. Lampard vs Oscar . 21 Right foot 20 . 3 Left foot 3 . 1 Head 2 . 21 Inside the area 17 . 4 Outside the area 8 . 2 Penalties 1 . Against Villa he drove a midfield that contained the quality of Eden Hazard, Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic – and outshone them all with an opening goal typical of the man whose shirt number he has taken on. Oscar rarely tops the charts in terms of the ground he covers (5.6 miles compared with Fabregas’ 7.4 this weekend) or his pace (his top speed of 16.8mph was lower even than John Terry’s 19.3) – but what he is is effective – and with Diego Costa leading the line he now gets the room he needs to pull the strings in that No 10 position. 'I played him (Oscar) again because I think he needs the confidence that comes with matches,’ Mourinho said after the 3-0 win. Lampard scored against his old club Chelsea for Manchester City but refused to celebrate the goal . Oscar wheels away after scoring  against Villa at Stamford Bridge, which took him to 25 goals for Chelsea . ‘His performance was good; he was in important areas of our game, the connection between him, Matic and Fabregas was good, the connection between him and the attacking players was good.’ In a combination of the No 10 role under Mourinho and from wide under Roberto Di Matteo and Rafael Benitez, Oscar has produced 25 goals and 23 assists in just over two seasons for the Blues. Lampard only had 17 goals in the same time period when he began his Chelsea career – and he was three years Oscar’s senior. Of the Brazilian's first 25 goals for the Blues, eight have come from outside the penalty box . Lampard became a Chelsea legend at Stamford Bridge and is the club's record goalscorer with 211 . While no-one is suggesting he will reach the same heights as Chelsea’s all-time greatest player, the numbers are still impressive for a player many thought had switched off with a focus on the World Cup towards the end of last season. Blues assistant Steve Holland spoke post-match about the importance of a Chelsea No 10 being a ‘goalscorer’ as well as a creator – and with two goals in a week Oscar is going some way towards that. With countryman Ramires out of the side through injury he needs to prove to Mourinho he has the temperament to impact on big games – and that starts on Tuesday night against Sporting Lisbon and in even more so in Sunday’s London derby against Arsenal. The 23-year-old Oscar will be hoping to start against Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday in the Champions League .

"Being the Premier League’s most expensive player can feel like a curse - just ask Robinho, Andriy Shevchenko and Fernando Torres. But for Manchester United’s record £60million buy Angel di Maria, signed from Real Madrid in the summer, there have been few teething problems so far in adjusting to life at Old Trafford - apart from the language. Despite already scoring wonderful goals against Queens Park Rangers and Leicester City, Di Maria’s stick-thin frame has led to concerns he won’t be able to deal with the rough stuff Premier League defenders occasionally dish out to skilled opponents. Angel di Maria has made an electric start to his Manchester United career following his summer move . The Argentina international (centre) joined in a £60million deal from Real Madrid . The 5ft 11in Argentine was listed on the Real Madrid website as weighing 11st and his former team-mate Mesut Ozil, who made the journey from the Bernabeu to Arsenal 12 months earlier, struggled with the physicality of English football during his first season. Ahead of Sunday’s midday showdown with Everton, in which he will be regarded as United’s main threat particularly following Wayne Rooney’s suspension, di Maria has assured the club’s fans he won’t be cowed by the combative nature of English football. ‘I have already noticed it is a more physical, aggressive style of football here than in La Liga,’ said Di Maria, who averaged only 1.3 tackles per game in Spain. Mesut Ozil (top) has struggled with the physicality of English football since his move from Real . ‘Players here are more powerful and show their strength a lot more. It’s all about settling in as quickly as possible in another league so I’ve just got to do that and make things work. ‘I think there have been other players of a similar build and stature to me - slim if you like. They have come to England and shown a physical resilience and I hope to do the same as well. ‘The main thing is I’m really, really happy. It’s a league I’ve always wanted to play in and I’m overjoyed now I’ve come here.’ Eden Hazard (left) and David Silva (right) are two of the Premier League's most dangerous attacking players . Di Maria will take encouragement from the success that lightweights like David Silva and Eden Hazard have enjoyed in England. A free-kick belted past QPR goalkeeper Rob Green on his United home debut has helped, too. ‘I’m very happy with the start I’ve made,’ added the 26-year-old. ‘It’s not easy settling into a new type of football when you go somewhere for the first time but I’ve settled in quickly with my team-mates and the club. ‘I believe there are special players here. Even when I was starting out in Argentina, I was aware of names like Robin Van Persie and Wayne Rooney. Now I have a chance to line up with them and I am pleased with how our understanding has started off. It is about converting that understanding into chances and goals. I’ve got used to the style of play and my team-mates but what has got to come now with that is a series of good results.’ Di Maria scored on his home debut for United in their 4-0 thrashing vs QPR in the Premier League last month . United fans will agree with that last sentiment. Despite the goal-scoring threat posed by di Maria, Rooney, Van Persie, Radamel Falcao and Juan Mata, the team have been a defensive shambles, shipping five goals at Leicester and four at League One MK Dons in the Capital One Cup. And manager Louis van Gaal has already made it clear to his attacking superstars that he expects them to help contribute to the defensive organisation. There is no doubt that United fans should see the peak of Di Maria. At 26, he has enjoyed a spectacular last 12 months, regarded as the man of the match when Real Madrid won their 10th Champions League in May and then starring for Argentina in the World Cup. The 26-year-old was denied the opportunity to star for his country in the World Cup final due to a thigh injury . Many back home believe if Di Maria hadn’t suffered a thigh strain that forced him to miss the final against Germany, Argentina would be world champions. His biggest challenge may be learning fluent English. Van Gaal has ordered a host of his Spanish-speaking stars - including Antonio Valencia and David de Gea who have played here for a while - to take twice-weekly language lessons. Di Maria acknowledges he is doing his best but also lets slip a trade secret, that Van Gaal does use the Spanish he acquired from his time at Barcelona to aid communication. The record signing admits: ‘Learning English is not easy. I have a teacher and started taking classes, trying to speak a bit of English with him. United boss Louis van Gaal (left) has ordered Di Maria (right) to take English lessons twice-a-week . ‘It’s going quite well but it’s not going to happen overnight, its going to take time. But it’s something I have to do to settle in as quickly as possible. ‘It really helps that the manager speaks Spanish and one or two of the backroom staff speak good Spanish too. ‘There are Spanish-speaking players as well and it means between all of them, messages get across and at least I have someone to speak to as well!’ Like our Manchester United Facebook page.","Angel di Maria wants to be a Premier League hit despite his slim frame .

"The Spanish League agreed on Tuesday to charge Barcelona after their supporters were heard singing ‘Ronaldo is a drunk’ at the Nou Camp on Sunday night. The case will now be passed to the anti-violence committee who must decide whether or not to open an investigation. In a statement the League said it had listened to audio recordings of the match and were in agreement that in minute 65 of the game around 200 supporters repeatedly chanted ‘He is a drunk, Ronaldo is a drunk’. The action taken against Barcelona is part of a clampdown on all forms of crowd trouble and chants that are interpreted as being likely to provoke trouble. It comes after a Deportivo supporter was killed in a pitched battle before a match at Atletico Madrid’s Vicente Calderon stadium in November. Barcelona fans chanted 'Ronaldo is a drunk' about Real Madrid star Cristiano at the Nou Camp . Barcelona could now face disciplinary action from the Spanish league. Pictured is their star man Lionel Messi . This is the 52nd time since the death of the Deportivo fan Francisco Romero on November 30 that the league has asked the anti-violence committee to take action over a chant. Twelve different clubs first division clubs, and eight second division teams have been targeted but so far of the 52 league complaints, the anti-violence committee have only opened 10 investigations. So far no action has been taken but after the league reported Real Madrid supporters at Bernabeu for chanting ‘Messi is retarded’ in December, the club were reported to have identified the 17 supporters who started the chant and expelled them.

Despite the apparently frivolous nature of the song aimed at Ronaldo, Real Madrid fans were keen for action to be taken. Over 80 per cent of voters in one online poll demanded a stand be taken. The ‘drunk’ references towards Ronaldo were made after various photographs and videos were published of him enjoying 30th birthday party celebrations on the night Real Madrid were beaten 4-0 by city neighbours Atletico Madrid.","Spanish League have decided to take action after chants on Sunday .

"A Manchester United supporters' group is planning to entice Cristiano Ronaldo back to the club by flying over a 'COME HOME RONALDO' banner during their hero's next La Liga game. United Reel, which includes members from all over the world, has called for donations to help fund the fly-by plea, which is due to take place midway through the Real Madrid superstar's match against Villarreal at the Estadio El Madrigal on Saturday. The group has teamed up with affiliated supporters' clubs - MUSC United Arab Emirates, MUSC Lebanon and MUSC Egypt - to show their former player 'how much the United faithful still love and support him'. Manchester United fans want Cristiano Ronaldo to 'come home' to Old Trafford . Supporters' group United Reel are planning a fly over plea during the game between Real Madrid and Villarreal . The Portuguese superstar has given United supporters hope by admitting he misses his time at Old Trafford . In a statement on their official Twitter account, United Reel said: '... we are all united by our love for Cristiano both as a player and as a person. We stand united in our views and will not stop until we BRING RONALDO HOME!' The desperate group have also posted a picture of the huge banner, which they hope will attract worldwide attention with the game scheduled to be aired on Sky Sports and other major networks. It's not the first time that United fans have turned to a flying banner after a different group paid £840 to stage a similar stunt in an effort to oust beleaguered former manager David Moyes with the message: 'WRONG ONE - MOYES OUT' in March. Ronaldo left Old Trafford to join his boyhood club for a then world record fee of £80million in 2009. Although he has collected silverware at the Bernabeu, including the elusive tenth European Cup - La Decima - recent complaints regarding the club's transfer policy have given supporters hope. Louis van Gaal also spoke publicly about the player, insisting he would love to sign him, though also admitting he thought Madrid wouldn't sell.

United fans used a different type of banner message to try to oust former manager David Moyes in March . A package of around £120m would be needed to bring Ronaldo back to Old Trafford, something which may be too much for United with the prospect of Radamel Falcao signing permanently next summer. However, the 29-year-old appeared to dismiss the notion of a return after his latest starring performance in scoring four goals during Real Madrid's 5-1 victory over Elche on Tuesday. 'They are all speculations about my future ... My future is Madrid. I'm happy this season is going well and my future, I will not speak about, it does not make sense,' he said.

"At his best, Yaya Toure is like a thoroughbred stallion, but you might have forgotten that reading some of the headlines after his performance against Bayern Munich. OK, he wasn't at his best. His body shape exposes him when he is not at the peak of his powers. An average World Cup, a long return journey from Cameroon after a 4-1 defeat for the Ivory Coast last week - these might be taking their toll. He was left out of the 18 for the 2-2 draw against Arsenal after his delayed return from Africa, but the rest didn't seem to help him. He still hasn’t rediscovered his sharpness from last season. Yaya Toure found it tough going as Manchester City were beaten 1-0 by Bayern Munich on Wednesday night . Toure is beaten to the ball by Bayern defender Juan Bernat during the Champions League encounter . Toure was left frustrated as Bayern had the better of the chances at the Allianz Arena . Alonso 12.09km (7.51 miles) Alaba 11.44 (7.11) Gotze 11.41 (7.09) Lahm 11.29 (7.02) Silva 11.10 (7.02) Navas 11.07 (6.88) Toure 10.89 (6.77) Fernandinho 10.65 (6.62) Sagna 10.37 (6.44) His stuttering performance is worthy of scrutiny, but let’s not jump in two-footed here. He’s still a player you want in your team and it’s too soon to be dismissing him. Jose Mourinho will be aware of his destructive capabilities when Chelsea meet City on Sunday and City will be more of a threat with Yaya in the team. Chelsea will have a gameplan to stop him. Players can often suffer a World Cup hangover. This time last season, Toure had three goals in five games for City, whereas this time around, he has yet to score. He looked to be breathing heavily in Germany and, yes, he seemed to leave his midfield sidekick Fernandinho to carry the load against Bayern. However, a look at the running stats from Munich are quite surprising: he covered more distance than his Brazilian team-mate, although both players were left behind by their Bayern rivals (see table above). There is a difference between appearing to float across the pitch and what seems to be a heavy-footed lumber. Toure's heat map in the Bayern Munich match . Toure was in imperious form last season as City marched to their second Premier League title in three years . Manager Manuel Pellegrini and Toure get their hands on the Premier League trophy last season . Manuel Pellegrini worked hard on his match sharpness last season and we got to see the best of him. Maybe that is all that he lacks right now. Players like Toure - and Wayne Rooney also suffers from this - can look lethargic and cumbersome when they are not at the peak of their powers. He was certainly sluggish at times in the Allianz Arena. I’m not unduly worried, because I’m convinced he can return to the levels of last season. It has also been pointed out that he was exposed because he played in a midfield two in Germany, but that’s where he spent most of last season. The beauty of Yaya is that he can be just as comfortable in a two, or playing more advanced as a second striker. What is a problem is if he is playing with a bit of a sulk. Does he have his contract issue on his mind? He is 31, he is contracted to 2017 and, while I remain a huge fan, does he really deserve an extension? City seem pretty smart with their business and Yaya looks to me to be a player who plays better when he is hungry, not when he is comfortable. Jamie Redknapp meets and interviews Toure at Man City's training ground back in April . Toure rattles home his goal in City's 3-0 win over Man United at Old Trafford last season . Toure on the rampage during City's match with Swansea at the Etihad Stadium last season . Talk of a lack of birthday cake and support after the death of a brother seemed to be a smokescreen to me. He knows how to play with Fernandinho, who is a good foil for him. Last season, it was was a partnership that allowed him to get forward and score plenty. When I interviewed Yaya for Sportsmail, he said this of his fellow midfielder: ‘He’s very clever. Brazilians play pretty, fantastic football and Fernandinho is clever - he anticipates well, he presses well. His movement is so good but he can play with the ball as well. 'Before he came to City, he was at Shakhtar playing in my position, more as an offensive midfielder. Sometimes we have some difficulties because when he attacks I have to stay more to protect the defence, but we are doing well and he helps me a lot. Jerome Boateng, a former City player, scored a late winner for Bayern in Wednesday night's match . Toure and his team-mates could only look on as Boateng's shot took a deflection off Mario Gotze and went in . VIDEO We deserved the win - Guardiola . 'The manager demands a lot from us because he wants us to have more of the ball and he wants us to attack. He doesn’t want to just score and defend.’ When he gets his body right and his mind clear, I still think we are looking at a beast of an operator. Yes, he needs to pull his finger out. But we know he has the game to do that. He scored 22 goals from midfield last season and was the most influential player as Manchester City won the title. So before we write him off, let’s take a close look at him against Chelsea at the weekend. Big players are drawn to the big games and while he wasn't at his best in Munich, a heavyweight Premier League encounter is Yaya Toure’s kind of stage.","Yaya Toure's lack of match sharpness was evident in Manchester City's loss to Bayern Munich in the Champions League .

"When Luis Suarez chased down Villarreal defender Mateo Mussachio, dispossessed him, and crossed for Barcelona to open the scoring in the Copa del Rey semi-final first-leg two weeks ago, the Nou Camp chanted his name. It was a strange moment, especially as the goalscorer had been Lionel Messi. It seems Suarez has won over his new supporters almost without scoring goals. He turns up in Manchester for his first game on English soil since his £75million transfer having scored just seven times in all competitions in 22 games, but there is no crisis because supporters have learned to love the new Suarez – the one who makes their all-star front-three tick. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez training together . Luis Suarez arrives at Manchester airport with his Barcelona team-mates on Monday afternoon . Suarez's move to Barcelona has seen him become a hit but not just for scoring goals at the Nou Camp . Suarez landed with his Barcelona team-mates ahead of their match against Manchester City on Tuesday . Messi has 37 goals and Neymar has 24 and, as Sergio Busquets tells Sportsmail in an exclusive interview, the Barca dressing room feels that Suarez’s work off the ball has been a major part of that. ‘We don’t play the way Liverpool play; he is not receiving the final pass as often,’ Busquets says, justifying the scoring dip since last season. ‘But since he arrived he has given us a lot more power up front in games and he opens the space up for other players with his running off the ball.’ In his 22 games so far he has clocked-up 12 assists and given Barcelona a presence in attack that has allowed Messi in particular to find a little more time and space.

Suarez attempts the spectacular as he prepares to face Manchester City in the Champions League . ‘It helps that they get on well together off the pitch,’ said coach Luis Enrique recently and the mate-sharing sessions with Javier Mascherano have certainly helped his acceptance into the group. If the lack of goals have been a surprise perhaps the sacrifice on the pitch should not be. For all his flaws Suarez could never be accused of not being a team player. When he turned up at Liverpool in January 2011 he didn’t ask to become the club’s designated penalty taker as his replacement Mario Balotelli did when he joined this summer. And when in January 2013 the club signed Daniel Sturridge the potential clash of egos never came to pass because Suarez happily played wider or deeper to accommodate Brendan Rodgers’ new centre-forward. Former Liverpool striker Suarez has given Messi license to roam more and play with freedom . Suarez runs with the ball during Barcelona's La Liga match against Malaga on Saturday . Suarez has proved to be a hit at Barcelona almost without scoring goals as he turns provider . In his autobiography Crossing the Line published last year he admits to feeling selfish at Anfield only once – during the last game of the season against Newcastle when he felt his team-mates were running the clock down because the title dream had died while he wanted another goal to pip Cristiano Ronaldo to the Golden Shoe. ‘When we were winning and players were gesturing for us just to keep the ball, I was saying the opposite. I wanted us to attack, to go forward. I got wound up. I was shouting, ""No, no, attack!""' he admits. In the end he stayed on 31 goals and shared the prize with the Portuguese. This season there will be no repeat of that feat. He has only four league goals and trails Ronaldo by 25 goals. But in his first season at his new club that will not matter. What will matter is that he make an impact in his first appearance back on English soil since that home win over Newcastle on the last day of last season. Suarez (left) can often be seen enjoying himself in training with his Barcelona team-mates . Neymar (left) and Suarez share a joke in Barcelona's training session previously after his move . Suarez jokes with his Barcelona team-mates as he gets used to life in Spain with the La Liga giants . With the return coming at the Etihad he will be up against the player who he described as probably his toughest opponent – Vincent Kompany. ‘We’d benefited too from Vincent Kompany getting injured and Yaya Toure going off after picking up a knock’ he said of that famous win over Manchester City at Anfield that had Liverpool believing it really was going to be their year. ‘Kompany is probably the hardest defender I faced in the Premier League – he organises City, and is one of the best in the world in his position.' ‘We go again’ was the famous Steven Gerrard war-cry at the end of that Liverpool win over City. A slip from Kompany led to one of the goals. Now Barcelona must go again after the weekend defeat to Malaga. It was the first time they had not won since the opening game of the year when coach Luis Enrique left Messi and Neymar on the bench for the first half. Since that 1-0 reverse the 11-game winning run produced 40 goals and 28 of them had come from the boots of the front three. Only four of those came from Suarez but the spectacular scissor kick coming off the bench in the 5-0 win over Levante was perhaps the pick of the bunch.

Tuesday night’s game represents a chance for them to get back in the winning routine immediately, and will give Suarez a chance to get back in the scoring habit. What he can be sure of however is that if he doesn’t find the back of the net but he does manage to find Neymar and Messi, and they do, then no one will be complaining.","Luis Suarez joined Barcelona from Liverpool in a £75million switch in 2014 .

"It has been billed as a rare moment in music history – the release of the only song ever recorded by Freddie Mercury and Michael Jackson together. The unfinished track, which is going on sale tomorrow, was discovered only by chance after languishing for nearly 30 years at the bottom of a vault – and has been reworked by the surviving members of Mercury’s band Queen. Now, The Mail on Sunday can reveal the reason why the song, There Must Be More To Life Than This, was never completed back in the 1980s – the increasingly erratic behaviour of Jackson and the antics of his pet chimp Bubbles. Scroll down for video . Soul mate: Michael Jackson insisted on bringing Bubbles into the studio and asking for its views on singing . Unfinished: The song was never completed by Jackson and Mercury, pictured together, back in the 1980s . Mercury, then at the height of his powers as a performing artist, complained that Bubbles was a bizarre distraction because Jackson insisted on bringing the animal into the studio and asking for its views on their singing. The Queen frontman, who was famed for his tempestuous nature, finally stormed out of the recording after telling friends: ‘I’m not performing with a f****** chimp sitting next to me each night.’ The story is told in a new book by respected showbusiness writer David Wigg, who knew Mercury well. He says: ‘Freddie got very angry because Michael made Bubbles sit between them and would turn to the chimp between takes and ask, “Don’t you think that was lovely?” or, “Do you think we should do that again?” After a few days of this, Freddie just exploded. ‘He phoned his manager and told him to “get me out of this zoo”. Freddie then flew back to London, leaving the track musically unfinished.’ First release: The track has been reworked by the surviving members of Queen, including Brian May (pictured)","Only song recorded by Michael Jackson and Freddie Mercury to go on sale .

"Leicester City's on-loan midfielder Nick Powell would seem to have a place in his heart for another Midlands club as a youngster if a picture he posted on Instagram is any guide. Displaying an impressive mop of blond hair, he showed off admirable ball skills even back then as he had a kick about in his garden. Powell posted the message with the tagline: 'Guess I liked Villa back in the day. Worldie haircut!' Nick Powell displayed a fondness for Aston Villa in his younger years . The 20-year-old joined the Foxes on a season-long loan from Manchester United but is yet to make an appearance for Nigel Pearson's men. United signed the midfielder from Crewe Alexandra in 2012 and big things are expected of him.

"A child who suffered from thousands of seizures a week is finally on the road to recovery - after her parents treated her with cannabis. Doctors told Paige and Matt Figi that their daughter, Charlotte, would not survive much longer after she was diagnosed with a rare form of epilepsy. But after years of researching possible cures, her desperate parents have resorted to feeding her marijuana - after stumbling across the controversial treatment online. Charlotte Figi (pictured since her treatment), six, has Dravet syndrome - a rare and severe form of epilepsy. She was having a thousand seizures a week and her parents were told to prepare for the worst . And incredibly, after just a few months, Charlotte has finally begun to walk and talk for the first time - to the amazement of doctors - and her seizures have almost completely stopped. Mrs Figi said: ‘We tried everything possible, and doctors kept telling us she was going to die. ‘When Matt first told me about the treatment I was horrified - I didn't want my daughter to get high. ‘But we were desperate and Matt practically begged me to try it. We had tried everything else and nothing was able to help our daughter. ‘But after just one treatment, we were astounded - I couldn't believe the effect it had on Charlotte. ‘She's like a totally different girl. We never thought that marijuana would help us give our daughter a chance at life.’ After years of researching possible cures, her desperate parents have resorted to feeding her marijuana - after stumbling across the controversial treatment online. She is pictured since the treatment . Six-year-old Charlotte had her first seizures when she was just three-months-old, she had a normal birth and has a twin sister. Within a week, she had started to suffer from violent seizures several times a day. She was eventually diagnosed with Dravet syndrome - a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy that begins in infancy. Children with the condition tend to develop normally as babies but progress starts to plateau in the second year of life. After just a few months, Charlotte (pictured before her treatment) finally began to walk and talk for the first time - to the amazement of doctors - and her seizures have almost completely stopped . Sufferers face a higher incidence of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy patients (SUDEP). They often also experience other conditions including developmental delays, sleeping difficulties, chronic infections and difficulty feeding. Dravet syndrome is a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy that begins in infancy. Children with Dravets tend to have normal development as babies but development starts to plateau when they are in their second year of life. Individuals with Dravet syndrome face a higher incidence of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy patients (SUDEP). They often also experience other conditions including developmental delays, sleeping difficulties, chronic infections and difficulty feeding. There is currently no cure and treatment options are limited - they mainly involve using anti-epilepsy drugs to treat the seizures. Little is known about the long term prognosis of people with Dravet syndrome. There is currently no cure and treatment options are limited - they mainly involve using anti-epilepsy drugs to treat the seizures. Little is known about the long term prognosis of people with Dravet syndrome. Mrs Figi, from Denver, Colorado, said: ‘We tried every medication possible to help stop the seizures and Charlotte was having thousands of small seizures a day. ‘Matt was serving in the U.S. Army in Afghanistan, so I was struggling to look after our children alone. ‘By the age of five, Charlotte was having a 300 seizures a week and had lost the ability to walk, talk and eat. ‘Matt was back and forth from Afghanistan throughout Charlotte's life, he had to eventually leave the military because he couldn't keep flying back during missions and training. ‘The doctors told us to prepare for her death - they told us that she wouldn't pull through.’ At this point, Mr Figi stumbled across an article online that claimed a child with the same condition as Charlotte had been treated effectively with cannabis. Mrs Figi said: ‘We were so desperate, Matt had heard of another child with the same condition who had used cannabis to help dramatically reduce the child's seizures. ‘When we first gave her the cannabis oil she went from having hundreds of seizures a day to none. ‘She went for seven days without a twitch. It was unbelievable. Charlotte (pictured since being treated with cannabis) had her first seizures when she was just three-months-old, she had a normal birth and has a twin sister who is not affected by the condition . ‘She now only has a few seizures a week. The oil is extracted from the cannabis leaf using alcohol. This is then diluted to a precise dosage. ‘Charlotte receives cannabis oil under her tongue, twice a day. The exact dosage is carefully measured and strictly controlled.’ Mrs Figi has been in contact with the Stanley brothers who run a non-profit organisation, called the Realm of Caring Foundation, which provides cannabis to adults and children suffering from epilepsy, cancer, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's, who cannot afford it. Charlotte's father, Matt Figi, had to leave the U.S. Army because of her illness. When she was very ill he had to be called home from Afghanistan to be by her side . The six brothers have been working for years cross-breeding a strain of marijuana that has medicinal properties but does not trigger psychoactivity or induce a 'high'. According to CNN, the strain is low in tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the compound in marijuana that is s psychoactive. It is also high in cannabidiol, or CBD, which has medicinal properties but no psychoactivity. Scientists think the CBD quiets the excessive electrical and chemical activity in the brain that causes seizures. Mrs Figi recalls: ‘Joe and his family were really nervous and apprehensive to treat Charlotte as she was the youngest patient they had ever had. ‘I had to assure them that it would be okay and that I had already had to sign a do not resuscitate order. ‘After a month of success they changed the name of the strain to Charlotte's Web, which I think is a great name for it. Mrs Figi has been in contact with the Stanley brothers who run a non-profit organisation which provides cannabis to people with epilepsy (Charlotte is pictured in one of their promotional tents) ‘The Stanley brothers do it for very little money and sell the cannabis for pennies.’ Parents all over the U.S. have been inundating Mrs Figi with phone calls and emails expressing their hope for a possible remedy to the syndrome. She said: ‘Over 200 paediatric patients will be trying Charlotte's Web in the next few weeks, we expect there will be thousands soon. ‘I don't have a political agenda, I just want parents to be able to treat and help their children. ‘Parents need access to this medicine as soon as possible.’ Medical marijuana is currently legal in 20 U.S. states .","Charlotte Figi has Dravet syndrome - a rare and severe form of epilepsy .

"Arsene Wenger expects Chelsea to take a tumble at some stage but he’s far less convinced that Diego Costa’s much-discussed hamstrings will creak under the strain. It was put to Wenger that Jose Mourinho might be applying a smokescreen in his regular comments about the allegedly fragile hamstrings of his striker. Arsenal’s manager smiled at the suggestions before today’s clash at Stamford Bridge, saying: ‘Honestly, when you see him play it is not obvious (that he has an injury). Diego Costa in training for Chelsea ahead of the clash with Arsenal on Sunday . Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has questioned Costa's injury problems ahead of the showdown . ‘He has had a problem with his hamstring for a long time and we saw that in the Champions League final but when I have seen him recently, it is difficult to guess that he has a hamstring problem.’ With a ratio of eight Premier League goals in six games, it’s certainly possible to share that conclusion. The 25-year-old’s impact appears to have made up for Chelsea’s striking shortcomings from last season, with Wenger admitting they are favourites for the title though he raised questions over their staying power. He said: ‘They are one of the favourites. They have had the perfect start and have the best numbers until now. On Sunday they are the favourites. But every team had its difficulties at some stage in the season.’ The 25-year-old has been in supreme form for Chelsea scoring eight in six Premier League games so far . Jose Mourinho is unbeaten in meetings with Wenger as a manager . Despite Chelsea’s fine start, and Wenger’s woeful record against Mourinho, the Frenchman insisted he would not alter his tactics for the match. ‘We have to adapt a little bit but let’s be honest, any single player at Chelsea can make a difference,’ Wenger  said. ‘If you mark Costa, Eden Hazard could score.

"Real Madrid can win their 10th consecutive Champions League game on Wednesday night in Gelsenkirchen equaling the competition record held by Bayern Munich. But to do so they must dismantle the wall Roberto di Matteo has waiting for them at the Veltins Arena. After a miserable run of form since the turn of the year that has seen them lose to both Valencia and Atletico Madrid in the league and get knocked out of the Copa del Rey, Real will be glad to be back in the competition that made them record breakers last season becoming the first team to win it 10 times. Carlo Ancelotti's Real Madrid side can earn a 10th straight Champions League win with victory over Schalke . The Madrid manager (left) oversees a training session with assistant Paul Clement (right) on Tuesday . And the prospect of reaching double figures in straight wins too, will only add to that. But they face a coach determined to ruin their quest to become the first team to retain the Champions League. Di Matteo, who won the competition with Chelsea thanks in no small part to heroic defensive displays against Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona in the semi-finals and Jupp Heynckes’ Bayern in the final in 2012, will string five across the back and tell Cristiano Ronaldo and company - give us your best shot. Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo walks through the Veltins Arena tunnel on Tuesday afternoon . The 30-year-old, pictured training on Tuesday, has four goals in his last 10 games for the Spanish giants . ‘He’s only human’ Di Matteo said on the eve of the game when asked about a run of form that has seen him score just four times in his last 10 games. Schalke: Wellenreuther; Uchida, Höwedes, Matip, Nastasic, Fuchs; Höger, Kirchihof, Boateng; Choupo-Moting, Huntelaar . Real Madrid: Casillas; Carvajal, Pepe, Varane, Marcelo; Silva, Kroos, Isco; Bale, Benzema, Ronaldo . Ronaldo is back at the scene of last season’s 6-1 Real Madrid win when the team that went on to win the competition really clicked into gear for the first time. Two goals each from Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Ronaldo earned Madrid that big win 12 months ago. It was the first sign of the potential of the trio that went on to lead Real to a 5-0 aggregate win over Bayern Munich in the semi-finals and a 4-1 win over Atletico Madrid in the final. Roberto di Matteo (middle) celebrates Chelsea's Champions League success in May 2012 . Gareth Bale (right) scores Real Madrid's fifth goal in an emphatic win over Schalke last February . The BBC of Benzema, Bale and Cristiano will all start on Wednesday night, but there is a very different look to the Madrid midfield that will play behind them compared to the one that helped destroy Schalke 12 months ago. Angel Di Maria, Luka Modric and Xabi Alonso played then. With Modric still a month away from fitness and Alonso and Di Maria sold, Toni Kroos will play between Lucas Silva and Isco. Kroos has played 2,995 minutes so far this season, more than any other Real Madrid player, and for Silva it would be his full debut. Defensively too there are problems with Sergio Ramos sidelined and Pepe only just back from injury – making his return 32 days after sustaining a rib injury against Atletico Madrid. The Portuguese was sorely missed in the 4-0 defeat by Atletico Madrid in the league 10 days ago and will partner Rafael Varane. Behind them Iker Casillas makes his 150th European appearance and will be glad to be far from those who whistled him at the Santiago Bernabeu at the weekend. The boo-boys have no doubt forgotten that it was his brilliant save last season at the Veltins Arena when the score was 1-0 to Real Madrid that paved the way for the 6-1 victory. His opposite number tonight will be Timon Wellenreuther a 19-year-old keeper who plays because first choice keeper Ralf Fährmann is injured. The former Tottenham winger celebrates his effort with his trademark heart-shaped gesture . The Welsh international (middle) celebrates with Karim Benzema (left) and Pepe (right) Veteran keeper Iker Casillas is expected to make his 150th European appearance on Wednesday night . Ahead of him the teenager will have the massed ranks of a very experienced defence that includes Benedikt Howedes who won the World Cup with Germany at left-back last summer; was given a torrid time at right-back by Ronaldo in this fixture last season; but who is much happier in a three-man central defence. He is joined by Manchester City loanee Matija Nastasic and Cameroon international Joel Matip. In attack Eric Choupo-Moting and Kevin Prince Boateng will carry a threat on the break and former Real Madrid forward Klass-Jan Huntelaar will be looking to punish his old club. Di Matteo has unhappy memories of his only previous meeting as a coach with Carlo Ancelotti. Back in 2010 his West Brom team were beaten 6-0 by Carlo’s Chelsea. His newly-promoted Baggies team were lambs to the slaughter five years ago just as Schalke were last year. This time there is a sense, at least among Schalke supporters who have already seen their team hold Bayern this season and move up to fourth place, that things will be different.","Real Madrid face Schalke in their last 16 Champions League clash on Wednesday night at the Veltins Arena .

"Officials . Jerome Murdough was just looking for a warm place to sleep on a frigid night last month when he curled up in an enclosed stairwell on the roof of a Harlem apartment building where he was arrested for trespassing. A week later, the mentally ill homeless man was found dead in a Rikers Island jail cell that four city officials say had overheated to at least 100 degrees, apparently because of malfunctioning equipment. The officials told The Associated Press that the 56-year-old former Marine was on anti-psychotic and anti-seizure medication, which may have made him more vulnerable to heat. He also apparently did not open a small vent in his cell, as other inmates did, to let in cool air. Alma Murdough and . her daughter Cheryl Warner hold a photo of Murdough's son, Jerome Murdough, 56, a mentally ill, . homeless former Marine who died in a Rikers Island jail cell . that was at least 100 degrees . 'He basically baked to death,' said one of the officials, who all spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to discuss specifics of the case. The medical examiner's office said an autopsy was inconclusive and that more tests were needed to determine Murdough's exact cause of death. But the officials, all with detailed knowledge of the case, say initial indications from the autopsy and investigation point to extreme dehydration or heat stroke. Advocates for mentally ill inmates in New York say the death represents the failure of the city's justice system on almost every level: by arresting Murdough instead of finding him help, by setting bail at a prohibitive $2,500 and by not supervising him closely in what is supposed to be a special observation unit for inmates with mental illnesses. Source of pride: A letter to Alma Murdough from the United States Marine Corps announcing the promotion of her son Jerome Murdough to the rank of Private First Class . Department of Correction spokesman Robin Campbell said in a statement that an internal investigation will look into all circumstances of Murdough's death, 'including issues of staff performance and the adequacy of procedures.' Campbell acknowledged that the temperature in Murdough's cell was 'unusually high' and that action has been taken to fix mechanical problems to ensure safe temperatures, 'particularly in areas housing vulnerable inmates.' Murdough's 75-year-old mother, Alma Murdough, said she did not learn of her son's death until the AP contacted her last week, nearly a month after he died. His public defender was told of the death three days after the inmate was found, the DOC said. 'He was a very lovely, caring guy,' said Murdough, adding that her son had bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and that she had not seen him in about three years. 'He had beer problems. Drinking beer. That was his downfall. Other than that, he was a very nice guy. He'd give you the shirt off his back.' Grieving mother: Alma Murdough's son was arrested last month for sleeping in the roof landing of a New York City . public housing project during one of the coldest recorded winters in . city history . Family members say Murdough grew up in Queens and joined the Marine Corps right out of high school, doing at least one stint in Okinawa, Japan. When he returned from the service, his family said, both his mental illness and thirst for alcohol became more pronounced, and he would often disappear for months at a time, finding warmth in hospitals, shelters and the streets. 'When he wanted to venture off, we let him, we allowed him to come and go,' recalled his sister, Cheryl Warner. 'He always came back.' Murdough's criminal record included 11 misdemeanor convictions for trespassing, drinking in public and minor drug charges, said Ivan Vogel, a public defender who represented him at his arraignment on the trespassing charge. According to the city officials, Murdough was locked alone into his 6-by-10 cinderblock cell at about 10.30pm February 14, a week after his arrest. Because he was in the mental-observation unit, he was supposed to be checked every 15 minutes as part of suicide watch, they said. But Murdough was not discovered until four hours later, at about 2.30am February 15. He was slumped over in his bed and already dead. Warrior: Murdough grew up in Queens and joined the Marine Corps out of high school, doing at least one tour of duty in Okinawa, Japan . When Murdough was found and his cell opened, his internal body temperature and the temperature in the cell were at least 100 degrees. Those temperatures could have been higher before he was discovered because the cell had been closed for several hours, the officials said. Dr. Susi Vassallo, an associate professor at New York University School of Medicine and a national expert on heat-related deaths who monitors heat conditions at Rikers Island, said psychotropic medications can impair the body's ability to cool itself by sweating, making it retain more heat than it should. Exposure to intense heat for a couple of hours by someone on such medications could be fatal, she said. Last year, only three Rikers inmates died from non-natural causes, according to Department of Correction statistics. Of . the 12,000 inmates who make up the nation's second-largest jail system, . about 40 per cent are mentally ill, and a third of them suffer from . serious mental problems the department said. Advocates and others have . long argued that correction officers are not sufficiently trained to . deal with mentally ill inmates whose needs are complex. Downward spiral: After leaving the military,  Murdough started indulging . in alcohol, and he would often disappear for months at a time . Catherine Abate, a member of the New York City Board of Correction, an agency charged with overseeing the city's jails, suggested at a recent public meeting that Murdough should have been referred him to psychiatric care, not to Rikers Island. Jennifer J. Parish, an attorney at the New York-based Urban Justice Center's Mental Health Project, said Murdough appeared to be a man in need of care. 'So Mr. Murdough violated the trespass law. So he suffered the consequences by going to jail,' Parish said. 'But the jail system committed more serious harm to him. And the question is, ""Will they ever be held responsible?""' Wanda Mehala, another of Murdough's sisters, said the family wants an explanation. 'We want justice for what was done,' she said. 'He wasn't just some old homeless person on the street. He was loved. He had a life. He had a family. He had feelings.'","Jerome Murdough, 56, had internal body temperature of at least 100 degrees when he was found dead in a cell in Rikers Island February 15 .

"Scientist David O'Reilly, who works for the tobacco industry, said nicotine makes your brain work better . A scientist employed by one of the biggest cigarette manufacturers today said nicotine is good for your health. Group scientific director for British American Tobacco, which makes Benson & Hedges, Dunhill and Lucky Strikes, David O'Reilly has been branded 'irresponsible' and accused of telling just part of the story. He told the Sunday Times Magazine smoking helps a person's brain work more effectively, adding: 'It helps with cognition, stimulation and relaxes.' His controversial claim came just a week after New York University researchers warned smokers of ecigarettes could inhale more nicotine than those who smoke regular cigarettes. Mr O'Reilly said likened taking a puff from an ecigarette to drinking a cup of coffee, as he claimed the practise was safe. But the senior molecular biologist has come under fire from health experts, who have accused him of trying to help 'sell as many cigarettes as possible'. Professor John Britton, chairman of the Royal College of Physicians tobacco advisory group and professor of epidemiology at the University of Nottingham, said one hit of nicotine can have positive effects on the brain. But he warned the drug is highly addictive, leaving smokers needing to get their hit to enable their brains to function normally. 'It is true that in a single use, . nicotine probably does improve concentration and hand-eye co-ordination, . on a par with what you get from caffeine,' he said. Health expert Professor John Britton claimed Mr O'Reilly's claim was 'irresponsible' accusing him of trying to 'sell more cigarettes' 'But it is also a powerfully addictive drug, and there comes a time when you need nicotine just for your brain to function normally.' A spokesman for BAT, said the company 'absolutely' stood by Mr O'Reilly's statement. He said Mr O'Reilly had not advised the drug was good for you in the sense of keeping well hydrated. A spokeswoman for Cancer Research added: ' We don't fully understand the long-term effects of nicotine use.'

Suarez looks on as Messi is left grounded after heading the rebound wide of Hart's goal on Tuesday . 'Scoring goals when you are the away team is not easy but they are a very good side so we know it is not over. We knew how tough it would be when the draw was made. Only Chelsea with PSG had as a difficult a draw.’ It was Suarez's first brace since joining Barcelona from Liverpool in the summer for £75m. He admitted to starting to feel the pressure of not having scored many goals in his first season but said his relationship on and off the field with Messi and Neymar had helped him come through it. Suarez said: ‘I’m aware of the team that I have joined and the amount of money that was paid for me and I knew everyone would be watching to see if I was going to justify that but I am also very conscious of the quality of the players that I have around me. ‘I am performing a function that helps them. I drag defenders out of position and that leaves space for Leo and Neymar and I play passes to them. And we know that when they get one on one with defenders – in situations like that they are unstoppable.

Suarez slides in ahead of Martin Demichelis to flick Jordi Alba's cross past Joe Hart and double Barca's lead . Suarez now has nine goals in 23 games for Barcelona. He said: ‘I have been used to teams pushing up and leaving space in behind but when you play for Barcelona most teams sit deep and don’t leave any space behind. ‘In the beginning I wasn’t worried at all because I knew the goals would come. But there was a time about a month ago at the start of the year when it started to play on my mind. ‘I am hard on myself when I feel I’m letting the team down and there was a time when I was missing good chances. But I have been around long enough to know that you play through these moments in your career. ‘Neymar is a joker and I get on well with him. And the relationship is very good with Leo and Masherano. No one in the squad feels superior to anyone else. I was surprised when I joined by how down to earth the players are.’ Suarez has formed a fearsome Barcelona trio alongside fellow frontmen Neymar (left) and Lionel Messi .","Joe Hart saved Lionel Messi' s penalty during Man City defeat to Barcelona .

"Six senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a symbol of the terrorists' expanding influence among Islamist groups. Withdrawing their loyalty to the Afghan Taliban's leader Mohammad Omar, the men - made up of the group's chief spokesman Shahidullah Shahid and five regional commanders - said they will remain members of the Pakistani Taliban, but added they now consider themselves affiliates of ISIS. The move is likely to have serious consequences for security in Pakistan, particularly near the Afghan border where all six of the men are based, leaving it open to the kind of violence and brutal oppression ISIS has employed in the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq under the group's control. Scroll down for video . Militants: Withdrawing their loyalty to the Afghan Taliban's leader Mohammad Omar, the men - made up of the group's chief spokesman Shahidullah Shahid (centre) and five regional commanders - said they will remain members of the Pakistani Taliban, but added they now consider themselves affiliates of ISIS . Leader: The six senior Pakistani Taliban figures pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and its so-called caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) in a symbol of the terrorists' expanding influence among Islamist groups . The official announcement of the six men's declaration of allegiance to ISIS came in the form of an audio recording that emerged yesterday. However rumours had been circulating for weeks that several senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban were set to declare their loyalty to al-Baghdadi. 'I show allegiance to the commander of faithful, Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Qureshi al Hussaini, and will listen and obey every order of you and will follow your orders regardless of what circumstances may be,'  Shahid said in the recording. There is now concern that other senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban may defect to ISIS, including the group's overall leader Maulana Fazlullah, who has previously voiced support for the terror group. Despite several members having declared their ISIS sympathies, yesterday's announcement is the first time any senior figure within the Pakistani Taliban has actually sworn allegiance to al-Baghdadi. It also points to the Pakistani Taliban's growing detachment from Mohammed Omar's central command in Afghanistan, as greater numbers of Muslim extremists abandon links with Al Qaeda to flock to the so-called 'caliphate' established by al-Baghdadi in northern Syrian and western Iraq. Armed: The Pakistani Taliban (pictured) has grown increasingly factious in recent months, as members seek to distance themselves from the group's central command in Afghanistan . The move points to the growing detachment from the Taliban's central command in Afghanistan, where Mullah Mohammed Omar (pictured) leads the group . The Islamic State was previously - like the Taliban - an affiliate of Al Qaeda, but terror leader Ayman al-Zawahiri admonished al-Baghdadi's group as too extreme and expelled the group late last year. Since then ISIS has gained vast swathes of territory in the Middle East, welcomed thousands of fanatics from around the world into its ranks, and become the richest terror group in history, thanks to donations from wealthy Sunni sympathisers and an income of up to £2million a day from oil fields. Pakistani Taliban spokesman Shahid has not been available for comment since the ISIS allegiance recording emerged yesterday, but the Washington Post has spoke anonymously with one of his close aides. 'These commanders will remain with the organization, but will also represent ISIS in Pakistan, he said. 'The decision came after differences developed with the Afghan Taliban. I can't say now what are the differences, but these commanders have changed their loyalties from Mullah Omar to ISIS chief Baghdadi,' he added. Terrorist: Rumours have been circulating for weeks that several senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban were set to declare their loyalty to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's militant group ISIS (pictured) Rumours that senior members of the Pakistani Taliban were likely to pledge allegiance to ISIS have circulated for weeks, and intensified last week when the group's leader Maulana Fazlullah voiced his support for the terrorists. However  the Pakistani Taliban's later issued a clarification of his words, insisting that for now the group were not abandoning historical ties with Mohammed Omar's Afghanistan branch. Following yesterday's announcement - where the group's official spokesperson and regional leaders in tribal areas close to the Afghan border, including Orakzai, Kurram, Khyber and Peshawar - pledged loyalty to al-Baghdadi, those links now appear weaker than ever. There have been signs that ISIS could gain a foothold in Pakistan for quite some time, despite the country already being home to more than two dozen terrorist groups. Last month, a 12-page pamphlet was distributed in Peshawar, inviting people to join the group. Malaysian police have detained another 13 Muslim men suspected to be linked to the Islamic State. Head of the national police counter-terrorism unit Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay says the men were detained yesterday in central Selangor state. He says further details will be released later today. Police last month picked up three Muslim men at the airport on suspicion of heading to Syria to join the Islamic State. Earlier this year, authorities detained 19 suspected militants for allegedly planning to carry out terrorist acts in the country and abroad. Seven have been charged so far and the rest released. Prime Minister Najib Razak has said the arrests show the government is serious in routing out militants.","Pakistani Taliban's spokesman and five local leaders declare loyalty to ISIS .

"Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer unexpectedly announcing his retirement earned him over $700 million. Ballmer, 57, took over from co-founder Bill Gates in January 2000, but his leadership was questioned throughout his tenure by Wall Street and Silicon Valley, as Microsoft's stock price floundered - until his surprise announcement sent shares up over seven per cent. With over 300 million shares, Ballmer is the company's second-largest shareholder, with only founder Bill Gates holding a larger stake in the company. Microsoft chief sxecutive Steve Ballmer, pictured, has announced his retirement, ending a 13-year reign at the head of the world's largest software company. Ballmer will stay in his position for the next 12 months as the company searches for his replacement . Ballmer's 333,252,990 shares rose to the collective tune of $786 million, according to Businessweek. There are no obvious candidates to succeed Ballmer at the company that has only had two CEOs in its 38-year history. Only last month Ballmer launched a reorganisation to reshape Microsoft into a company 'focused on devices and services'. Some industry watchers felt it was too little, too late in the effort to restore Microsoft as a technology leader. 'Since he took over in 2000, it is fair to say he missed a number of transitions: mobile, tablets, cloud,' said Zeus Kerravala, an analyst at ZK Research. 'Microsoft continues to live off traditional PC computing. Ballmer's strength is traditional PC computing. Ballmer was born in 1956 and grew up just outside Detroit. His father was a manager at the Ford motor company. Ballmer graduated from Harvard with a degree in mathematics and economics. He worked for two years at Procter & Gamble as an assistant product manager before dropping out of Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1980 and joining Microsoft. Ballmer was the first business manager to be employed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. In February 1992 he become executive vice president, Sales and Support before being made president of Microsoft from July 1998. In January 2000, Ballmer was officially named chief executive officer while Gates stayed on as chairman of the board. During Ballmer's time as CEO Microsoft has more than tripled revenues and doubled profits. 'He was a great guy for his era but times have changed and a new leadership is needed. It's hard to say his tenure has been a success.' Ballmer has tripled Microsoft's revenues and more than doubled its profits since he became CEO, yet the company's share price has stayed relatively steady and flat over the last decade. Shares peaked in late 1999 at a split-adjusted high of $59.97 but has failed to achieve this level since. Following Ballmer's note to employees announcing his departure, Microsoft shares rose 5.7 percent to $34.26 on Nasdaq. Ballmer is to retire within the next 12 months, once a special committee has selected a new CEO. Although he has faced criticism for some time, his decision to retire surprised analysts. Microsoft shares rose 5.7 percent to $34.26 on Nasdaq on Friday, seen here as the peak on the chart, following Ballmer's note to employees detailing his retirement . 'Yes, this was a surprise, especially considering how close it is to the recently announced strategic overhaul towards devices and services,' said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen. Ballmer himself acknowledged his decision was abrupt. 'There is never a perfect time for this type of transition, but now is the right time,' he wrote in a memo to employees. 'This is an emotional and difficult thing for me to do. I take this step in the best interests of the company I love.' Ballmer said in a statement he had originally considered retiring in the middle of the reorganisation, but eventually decided 'we need a CEO who will be here longer term for this new direction.' The committee to select a new CEO is to be chaired by John Thompson, the board's lead independent director, and includes Microsoft co-founder and chairman Bill Gates, as well as other board members Chuck Noski and Steve Luczo. It will consider both external and internal candidates and work with executive recruiting firm Heidrick & Struggles International, according to Microsoft.

"Three hundred league games and three goals to celebrate – Leo Messi marked a landmark appearance by scoring the treble that sunk Levante and moved Barcelona back to to within a point of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga. In those 300 league matches the 27-year-old Argentine has now scored 269 La Liga goals. It was also the 23rd time he had scored three in one game drawing him level with Cristiano Ronaldo as the player with the most hat-tricks in the domestic competition. The Argentine was the star once again but Luis Suarez's over-head volley was the goal of the game. He climbed off the bench in the second half to complete the perfect afternoon for Barcelona. Neymar also scored and with Manchester City just 10 days away Barça have top form winning their last 11 games. Lionel Messi scores his hat trick during an impressive performance in Barcelona's 5-0 win over Levante . The Argentinian (left) was superb throughout and scored his fifth La Liga hat trick of the season . Luis Suarez scored a wonderful bicycle kick after coming off the bench for Luis Enrique's side . They started strongly with Sergio Busquets playing in Pedro but the winger failed to finish. Levante had their first chance when David Barral shot on five minutes but it was largely one-way traffic from then on in with Barcelona failing to take their chances at first. Messi and Ivan Rakitic both went close before finally Neymar put the home side ahead with one of the strangest goals he has scored so far this season. Messi crossed from the right and the Brazilian miss-hit his volley but as he sliced it the Levante keeper Diego Mariño was caught off his line and it sailed over his head and into the back of the net. It was yet another Messi assist for Neymar who is even scoring them this season when he fails to catch them cleanly. The dynamic duo of the South Americans was too much for Levante who couldn't handle the skill or pace . Neymar celebrates after scoring the opening goal for Barcelona during their convincing 5-0 win over Levante . Messi had his assist now he needed a goal. He should have been awarded a free-kick on the edge of the area when David Navarro deliberately backed into him and flattened him but the referee didn't see it. Messi then shot weakly at Mariño after being put through by Rakitic. He was getting closer though and on 39 minutes the goal came. It was his finish but it owed much to Marc Bartra's midfield steal and pass. It should have been 3-0 before the break when Adriano crossed from the left. Pedro missed the first attempt, Neymar flicked the ball to Messi but he blasted over the bar. Lionel Messi (centre) slots home his first of the game past the on rushing Diero Marina at the Camp Nou . Neymar and Messi dazzled throughout as Levante had no answer to the slick, total football of Barcelona . Barca XI: Bravo; Montoya, Bartra, Mascherano, Adriano; Busquets, Xavi, Rakitic (Roberto -62); Pedro, Messi, Neymar (Suarez - 67) Barca subs: ter Stegen, Mathieu, Alba, Pique, Rafinha, . Goals: Neymar 17, Messi 38, 59, 65 (p), Suarez 73 . Booked: Busquets . Levante XI: Marino; Ivan Lopez (Jason - 71), Navarro, Ramis, Tono; Diop (Mari - 78), Simao; Xumetra, Barral, Morales; Uche (Victor - 62) Levante subs: Fernandez, Juanfran, Vyntra, Garcia . Booked: Ramis, Barral . Neymar started the second half brightly but he just failed to convert Pedro's cross and was too unselfish when through on goal playing his pass just behind Messi instead of finishing himself. He found Messi again moments later after a mazy run across the face of the penalty area. The Argentine played in Pedro but he failed to beat the keeper. Pedro turned provider on the hour when found by Busquets and he crossed for Messi to get his second of the game and Barça's third. The hat-trick came when Neymar went down the right and was brought down by Ivan Lopez in the area. This time there was no handing over the baton to Neymar. After the Brazilian's missed midweek spot-kick penalty-taking duties were handed back to Messi and he sent Mariño the wrong way to make it 4-0. Messi shined as Barcelona returned to the total football which has been their label over previous years . That was Neymar's last contribution with Suarez brought on to replace him. The former Liverpool striker would not have been too happy being rested such is his need to starting adding goals to his prolific assist-count but he wasted no time in getting on the scoresheet. Adriano crossed from the left and the Uruguayan volleyed past Mariño with an overhead kick that got perhaps the biggest cheer of the afternoon. The Nou Camp want him to succeed and they know a confidence-boosting goal just ahead of the return of Champions League football can only help his cause.

"Far from the maddening roar of Formula One, Daniel Ricciardo's preparations for the Japan Grand Prix took a peaceful turn as the Red Bull driver visited sacred temples in Tokyo. The Australian, who stands third in the F1 drivers' championship, tried his hand at the ancient Zen Bhuddist meditation discipline of Zazen on Wednesday as he explored the Shinto area of Japan's capital. Ricciardo, 25, also took part in a Japanese Shinto prayer at the nearby Asakusa Shrine, one of the area's most famous holy buildings known also as the Sanja-sama, or Shrine of the Three gods. It was a major change of pace for Ricciardo, who's been a revelation in a debut season with Red Bull that's seen his three race wins and seven podiums overshadow team-mate Sebastian Vettel, the four-times consecutive champion. Daniel Ricciardo meditates in the Zenshoan Temple in Tokyo ahead of the Japanese Formula One Grand Prix . Red Bull driver Ricciardo takes part in Zazen, a Zen Bhuddist meditation discipline at the famous Zenshoan Temple on Wednesday . Ricciardo is hit with a 'keisaku', which can be translated into a 'warning stick' or 'awakening stick', and used by the jikijitsu (right) to keep his subjects concentrating . With five races left in the season, starting with Suzuka on Sunday, Lewis Hamilton holds a narrow lead over his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, with Ricciardo a further 57 points adrift. But with the Brit and the German set to continue their season's battle for the top spot until the last race in Abu Dhabi, many pundits already consider Ricciardo the big winner. Former F1 team owner Eddie Jordan says the Aussie has been a revelation for the sport. 'He's one of the best things to happen to F1 in a very long time,' Jordan told the BBC's website in a Q&A with readers. 'He is the surprise package of the year. If you'd said to me at the beginning of the year that this guy would win three races and Vettel would win none, I would have said you were dreaming.'

While he doesn't think Ricciardo can win, the lad from Perth has every intention to chase the next rung on the podium come year's end. Even with mechanical issues - including a battering malfunction on lap one - hindering his run last time out in Singapore, he managed to salvage third place at the Marina Bay Circuit. A lack of power meant that although he caught up to Vettel, he couldn't find a way past his team-mate who finished in second. 'We definitely had a few issues and we tried fixing them but, to be honest, we didn't quite clear it all up,' Ricciardo said after the race. 'I was a bit frustrated, a bit concerned as well that we wouldn't get it to the flag, but luckily it held on. 'We'll just have look at it and I'm sure we'll fix it for Japan.' Ricciardo goes into the last five races of the season 57 points behind second-placed Nico Rosberg, while Lewis Hamilton is in the lead by just three points .

"It only took about 10 minutes. 'F*** off Cesc Fabregas' was the poisonous chant that cascaded down from the Arsenal fans in one corner, once they'd finally all got in for this highly-charged London derby. 303 appearances, 57 goals, innumerable moments of magic, all those afternoons of glory - all lost amid football's tribal atmosphere. Fabregas's achievements at Arsenal, who he represented for eight seasons and captained, quickly forgotten by some with short memories after his move to their rivals in the blue corner of London. Cesc Fabregas produced a masterful performance against his former club as Chelsea beat Arsenal 2-0 . Fabregas plays another accurate pass from midfield as Arsenal's Danny Welbeck watches on . Fabregas (right) celebrates with Diego Costa after supplying the assist for Chelsea's second goal . On the pitch, vicious tackles flew in. In the stands, barbs were traded. On the touchline, Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho squared up like protagonists in a playground scrap. And down there in the maelstrom, one man just got on with the job he's always done with such class and distinction. For Fabregas, this was just business as usual. He would have cared little for the Arsenal taunts - bygones are bygones, what's done is done. He is loving life at Stamford Bridge, as Mourinho asserted in the build-up. There are no regrets at all. Fabregas's performance in Chelsea's 2-0 win reminded you of the opening lines of Rudyard Kipling's 'If': 'If you can keep your head when all about you/Are losing theirs and blaming it on you.' Fabregas battles with Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez during the contest at Stamford Bridge . Fabregas's heat map from the match shows his presence right across the midfield . Fabregas played a delightful ball for Diego Costa to score Chelsea's second goal late on . Passes: 69 . Passing accuracy: 88.4 % . Long passes: 7 . Short passes: 62 . Recoveries: 13 . Tackles: 4 . Chances created: 3 . Assists: 1 . The Spaniard may not be about to inherit the Earth and everything in it, but more displays like this and Chelsea will certainly win the Premier League. Arsenal are imposters to triumph, blown away again by Chelsea, whom they now trail by nine points in the table. Fabregas's afternoon was a masterclass in consistency. His passing was measured, metronomic as usual. He played 69 passes with an accuracy of 88.4 per cent. Jack Wilshere, by contrast, made just 43 passes, Mesut Ozil 56. His heat map shows Fabregas as an omnipresence in the midfield, popping up right across the wide sweep of his own half. He recovered possession on 13 separate occasions. But the Catalan artist left his piece de resistance until right near the end. A magnificent ball over the top of the Arsenal defence that picked out Diego Costa. The rest was inevitable; a deft chip over the hopelessly stranded Wojciech Szczesny. Fabregas well and truly won the midfield battle against Jack Wilshere as Chelsea emerged 2-0 winners . Fabregas (second left) greets the Arsenal players ahead of the kick-off . Fabregas is flashed up on the Stamford Bridge big screen located high above the Arsenal fans . Mourinho went the extra mile to ensure Fabregas chose Chelsea over Arsenal or Manchester City in the summer, flying out to Spain for a personal audience within days of learning Barcelona had made him available. He wooed the World Cup-winner with a promise that he would be the keystone in Chelsea's midfield, and so it has proved. His assist in Costa's goal was his fourth for his compatriot already this season and his seventh overall, more than any Chelsea player managed in the whole of last season. Little wonder Roman Abramovich was on his feet in the director's box punching the air in delight. The £62m on those two could well be the best money he's ever spent. A delay to kick-off as Arsenal fans were held up getting in to Stamford Bridge wouldn't have helped Fabregas's pre-match nerves but once he got a first feel for the ball, he was irrepressible. Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich jumps in the air after Costa doubles his team's lead . Jack Wilshere and Fabregas share a word as they walk off at half-time . Arsenal believed Fabregas had handled in Wilshere's shot but the referee was unmoved . He didn't misplace a pass inside the first 20 minutes and made a perfectly-timed tackle on compatriot Santi Cazorla. A nicely flighted free-kick from the right was met by Nemanja Matic, but in an offside position. Always available to receive a pass, he pinged the ball about with characteristic ease and soon he was initiating the move with the steal that led to Eden Hazard winning - and then converting - a 26th-minute penalty. In the second-half, Fabregas robbed Ozil of the ball as the German shaped to shoot on the edge of the box. Within seconds, Chelsea were in Arsenal's penalty box. It was indicative of his dominance over the German - and the rest of Arsenal's midfield - in all departments. There was one moment when Wilshere's shot may have been blocked by Fabregas's hand but referee Martin Atkinson was unmoved by the appeals. And it was certainly accurately reflected in the final outcome as Chelsea's juggernaut rolled on.","Cesc Fabregas faced his former club Arsenal for Chelsea on Sunday .

"Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo were joined at Real Madrid’s training ground on Monday by the club’s irate president, Florentino Perez, unhappy at a humiliating 4-0 derby defeat to Atletico Madrid and the subsequent high-profile birthday party thrown by Ronaldo. Bale was at least in the clear on the second of those presidential gripes as, along with many other first-team players, he decided not to attend Ronaldo’s 30th birthday party coming as it did so close to what Carlo Ancelotti called the ‘worst performance’ since he had taken over. Perez met with Real’s Italian coach for just over an hour and then addressed the squad asking them to get back to the kind of form they were showing before Christmas when they out-performed everyone in the group stages of the Champions League and established a healthy lead in the league which has now been trimmed to just one point by a resurgent Barcelona. Gareth Bale turns up for training at Real Madrid's training complex on Monday . Bale had skipped Christiano Ronaldo's 30th birthday party following Saturday's defeat by Atletico Madrid . President Florentino Perez talked to coach Carlo Ancelotti and players following derby drubbing . Perez has been a ruthless president in the past averaging one sacking a season for much of his time as the head of the most demanding club in football. Jose Mourinho bucked that trend by staying in the job under him for three years and Ancelotti looked on safe ground after winning the European Cup last summer but things change quickly in the Spanish capital. Real Madrid have been ravaged by injuries of late with Sergio Ramos, Pepe and Luka Modric all out of Saturday’s debacle. Cristiano Ronaldo was criticised after being filmed partying hours after Real Madrid were thrashed by Atletico . The Portuguese star, pictured with singing with Kevin Roldan (left), was celebrating his 30th birthday . Full-back Marcelo also missed the game and Real had only one of their first choice back four on the pitch but that carried little weight with Perez, who has a history of going to the training ground in times of crisis. As he drove into the huge Valdebebas complex by Madrid’s Barajas Airport he would have seen around 12 protesting fans holding up a banner which read: Vuestra risa, nuestra verguenza, translating as 'your laughter, our shame'.

"‘Have you met the Queen? She rides a lot. She should come here and ride with me!’ Mzee’s eyes brightened at the prospect. ‘She likes polo too!’ he added gleefully. ‘We don’t get to do enough of that here!’ But for Mzee – real name David – there’s no shortage of excitement to be found closer to home in southern Kenya’s picturesque Chyulu Hills. While polo might be an occasional treat for him, a bigger treat for me was just around the next acacia bush. ‘Look, look!’ he hissed, standing up in his stirrups. Saddle up on safari: Mawingu (left) with Mzee during a sunlit evening galloping around the savannah . Crashing through the underbrush, its broad grey back seemingly impervious to the spiny shrubs, was an enormous elephant. There was nothing but a short stretch of scrubby grass between it and me. A 100km stretch of volcanic mountains bisected by broad, grassy plains studded with thorny acacia trees, the Chyulu Hills might be a national park but they’re barely known compared to the mighty Masaai Mara to the west and the wildlife-packed Tsavo to the east. As a result, you’re never likely see hordes of vehicles converge on a sighting, if, indeed, you see anyone else at all. What you will find, however, are animals and plenty of them. Within seconds of stepping off the little bush plane that ferried us down to Chyulu from Nairobi’s international airport, we’d spotted a couple of honking wildebeest, a twitchy group of oryx and a dazzle – yes, that is the proper name – of peacefully grazing zebra. Magnificent: A giraffe picks its way delicately through the Chyulu Hills, photographed by Travelmail's Ruth . Sundowner with a difference: A group of local Maasai troop down the hill to dance for visitors at ol Donyo Lodge . But while seeing them from a game vehicle is fun, nothing beats getting up close and personal from the back of a horse. Mine was named Mawingu, a word that means cloud in the local Maa language and given to him on account of his pristine cream-coloured hide. We got along from the start, his nippy turn of pace and eagle eye for thorny bushes dovetailing neatly with my own plans: to see as much of the local wildlife as possible, while beating the zebras at their own game as they galloped across the savannah. With me was Mzee, given the Swahili honorific meaning grandfather by the younger men, and a chap who certainly knows his stuff when it comes to wildlife. Stunning: The lovely ol Donyo Lodge is run by the charming (and very funny) Ray and Alyssa . Striking: During the Great Migration, more than a million wildebeest and zebra stream into the Masai Mara . ‘You see . that?’ he’d ask as my much-younger eyes tried and failed to pick out a . black-backed jackal scurrying along in the distance. ‘You see?’ Sometimes I did, quite often I didn’t. What . I did see a lot of were elephants, many of which came daily to drink . from the watering hole in front of ol Donyo Lodge where I stayed. A . quirky mix of modern cool and Masaai detail, the lodge sits on a huge . private reservation and boasts its own stables, as well as entertainment . in the shape of managers Ray and Alyssa and their lovely staff. My room was vast – easily as big as the average London flat and with a private deck, complete with a personal pool. From . here, I watched as the local giraffes and elephants trudged to and from . the water, scattering smaller game as they made their way through the . trees. Enjoying the view: Along with wildebeest, a balloon ride is a good way to see buffalo and gazelle . Adorable: Daniel unearthed a cute dik dik antelope within 15 minutes of beginning the search . It would have been easy to stay put by that pool but Mawingu was waiting as was Ol’ Donyo’s other big natural attraction – a set of enormous fossilised lava tubes. Perched high on a hilltop, 30 minutes of rugged safari track and regular game sightings away, seeing Ol Donyo’s lava tubes requires sensible shoes – ideally not the suede loafers I had on – and nerves of steel. Down a steep track littered with rocks you go, dodging rock fig roots and keeping a safe distance from the local bats as you do. Inside, the tunnels are dark and vast, massive burned black walls, fractured with streaks of red sandstone. It feels a bit like being in your own Indiana Jones film, albeit that the treasure at the end is emerging, blinking into the light to find sundowners and ‘bities’ waiting for you. Bities, or small canapes, are one of the highlights of a Kenyan safari and Ol Donyo does them especially well. Banana and bacon bites, salty macadamia nuts and tiny goat’s cheese toasts all go down well after a hike deep into a lava tube. Delicious though they were, they tasted best following a sweaty gallop across the plain below with Mawingu and Mzee. On my first horseback safari, I found myself getting unexpectedly close to the natives: sitting quietly as a giraffe passed within feet of us, watching as a jackal – most of which dash off at the first rumbling of a car engine – edged closer, and freezing as an elephant ventured by. Adorable: The Masai Mara is crammed with wildlife, among them the Big Five, hippos and cheetah . ‘If it . charges at us, we’ll gallop away,’ said Mzee, reassuringly, although we . never had to. Lions and other big cats are few and far between in the . Chyulu Hills, not so good for first time visitors to Kenya but better . for those who want to ride. And in any case, there were plenty where we were going next: The mighty Masaai Mara. Lion, cheetah, leopard, hippo, elephant, giraffe and many more, you don’t have to go far to see something. With a Masaai guide like Daniel, the fantastically knowledgeable man in charge of our party, it takes minutes. ‘What do you want to see?’ he asked as we clambered into the car. I . wanted to see a dik dik – an adorably tiny antelope with huge Bambi . eyes. Heavenly: Sundowners with Mara Encounter Maasai guide Daniel came with a spectacular view . By the time we reached Encounter Mara, an open tented camp run by a cheerful South African named Colin and his Kenyan wife Chala, we’d seen one. While you fall asleep to the quiet sound of giraffes brushing through the bushes at Ol Donyo, at Mara Encounter, it’s to the huffing noise of hunting lions and the honking of their prey – wildebeest. It was the same story again at Mara Toto, a tiny tented camp close to the Mara River where each year, millions of wildebeest and zebra pile through the water en masse during the Great Migration. Although we didn’t see a crossing, we did get up early for a balloon flight that gave some sense of the scale of it. Below our silent vehicle, scores of wildebeest dotted the plain like black ants spilling from a termite mound, albeit much noisier. It was a truly incredible sight. But much in Kenya is incredible. From the bright pink flamingos of Lake Nakuru to the gorgeous Indian Ocean beaches of the coast where I ended my trip, it’s hard not to fall in love with the place. Perfect finish: The trip ended with a few days spent relaxing on a gorgeous Indian Ocean beach in Watamu . Sitting in a deckchair at the gorgeous Medina Palms, an idyllic bolthole perched on a sugar sand beach in Watamu, I didn’t want to leave. But it was the Chyulu Hills that proved the real eye opener. Hidden away in a corner of the country rarely visited by foreign tourists, overshadowed by the mighty Mount Kilimanjaro and home to some of the most beautiful beasts on the planet, the national park is a real hidden gem. Much like Mzee in fact. Perhaps he really will get to play polo with the Queen one day. In the meantime, he’ll have to settle for watching the elephants go by with me.

"The tool was introduced to football to help referees keep players sticking to the rules, but David Luiz found a way to make vanishing spray disappear on Tuesday night. PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was lining up for a free-kick against Chelsea on the right-hand edge of the penalty area in the Champions league clash, an angle not favourable for a shot at goal. The official had marked the spot for the kick to be taken from, but former Blues defender Luiz, decided to scoop up the spray and move it to the side while Cuneyt Cakir was not looking. David Luiz decides he doesn't like the look of where the referee has marked out the free-kick . The former Chelsea man rubbed out the foam with his hand while Zlatan Ibrahimovic waited behind him . Luiz then rubbed the foam from his hand into a different position . The Brazilian then pointed to the new position for the free-kick and Ibrahimovic promptly lined up his shot. Perhaps Luiz was trying to make up for his poor defending for the game's opening goal. Although playing in midfield, Luiz moved back into his area to mark Branislav Ivanovic but lost track of him just as his former team-mate rose highest to head past Salvatore Sirigu in the PSG goal. PSG, though, equalised with a headed goal of their own after the break. Edinson Cavani met Blaise Matuidi's cross to nod past Thibaut Courtois.

"Spanish football authorities could take the unprecedented step of closing part of one of its top club's stadiums after supporters sung a song that glorified domestic abuse. The Anti-violence Committee held an emergency meeting on Wednesday morning at the ministry for Sport's headquarters and has written to the Spanish FA strongly recommending the closure of the 'South End' of Real Betis' Benito Villamarín stadium. Betis is one of Spain's most famous clubs, currently lying third in the second division and coached by former West Brom manager Pepe Mel, but it was disgraced by its own supporters at the weekend when a section of spectators behind the goal sang songs in support of striker Ruben Castro. The Real Betis fans chanted their support of  Ruben Castro whose been charged with domestic violence . The Benito Villamarin stadium is in danger of being closed following the chants from the fans . The 33-year-old forward was charged in December with four counts of domestic violence and sending a threatening text message to his former partner. In Saturday's game between Betis and Girona Betis supporters sang 'Rubén Castro alé, Ruben Castro alé, no fue tu culpa, era una p***, lo hiciste bien' which translates as 'Ruben Castro, it was not your fault, she was a w****, you did the right thing'. A league official has reported the abusive chant – heard in Betis' last two games – to the League who informed the Anti-violence committee on Tuesday and they are now urging the Spanish FA to take action. Former West Bromwich Albion boss Pepe Mel is currently the manager of the Spanish second division side . Ever since a Deportivo supporter was murdered in fighting outside of the Vicente Calderon Stadium last November the football authorities in Spain have ordered a crackdown on behaviour in and around stadiums. The zero-tolerance policy has been open to ridicule at times with Barcelona supporters reported for singing 'Ronaldo is a drunk' and Madrid fans brought to book over a song about Lionel Messi. But the country has united in disgust at the Betis' fans behaviour. El Mundo reported in January that last year 51 women were murdered by their current or former partners. And at the end of 2013 the same newspaper reported that 700 women had died through domestic violence in the last decade. Castro was charged in December with four counts of domestic violence and threatening his former partner .","Real Betis could have their stadium closed following the distressing chants .

"The unborn children of Syrian women are the targets of a sickening war game where a shooter who murders a foetus in its mother’s womb is awarded with cigarettes, a British surgeon has revealed. Dr David Nott witnessed evidence of fighters using civilians as target practice and on several occasions shooting pregnant women in the stomach, killing their unborn babies. Dr Nott, recently returned from volunteering at a Syrian hospital, said there are local rumours the snipers are sell swords, working for the Assad regime, awarded when they ‘hit the correct targets’. Scroll down for video . Horrifying: The x-ray image shows a full-term foetus with a bullet lodged in its brain, shot dead in its mother's womb . Dr Nott, a vascular surgeon at Chelsea and Westminster hospital in London, has told of the horrors suffered by civilians caught between government troops and rebels, describing it as ‘hell beyond hell’. As women and children cross through the unnamed city where he was stationed, they would be shot by snipers – and their wounds followed disturbing patterns, . ‘From the first patients that came in in the morning, you could almost tell what you would see for the rest of the day. It was a game,’ he told The Times. War surgeon: Dr David Nott, pictured in 2008, treated civilian victims in Syria . ‘One day it would be shots to the groin. The next, it would only be the left chest. The day after, we would see no chest wounds; they were all neck [wounds].’ Dr Nott told the newspaper that in his 20 years volunteering in war zones, this is the first time he had witnessed pregnant women being targeted. He described the day two consecutive . patients arrived at his clinic, heavily pregnant with their babies shot . to death in their stomachs. ‘The . women were all shot through the uterus, so that must have been where . they were aiming for. I can’t even begin to tell you how awful it was. 'Usually, civilians are caught in the crossfire. This is the first time . I’ve ever seen anything like this. This was deliberate. It was hell . beyond hell.’ Dr Nott, who . counts Tony Blair among his former patients, has returned to London . after five weeks in Syria to reveal abysmal conditions in the local . hospitals with little to no evidence of aid. The . civil war in Syria show no evidence of slowing down today as government . air force jets bombarded the eastern city of Deir al-Zor on Friday. Heavy . overnight clashes saw the killing of dozens of rebels and pro-Assad . forces, including one of the president’s top military intelligence . officers, activists said. General Jama'a Jama'a was shot dead on . Thursday by snipers in the midst of a battle with rebels including . forces linked to al Qaeda, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. His . death, celebrated by rebels and opposition activists, marked a . significant setback for Assad's bid to retain a hold over the city, . capital of the eastern oil-producing province.

"Pep Guardiola fell out with his friend Tito Vilanova after the two were offered the job of taking over from Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, former Barcelona manager and player Charly Rexach has claimed. Rexach won the league with Barcelona as a player, was assistant to Johan Cruyff when the team won its first European Cup in 1992, and also managed the team before being replaced by Louis Van Gaal. Asked in interview in local Catalan paper Regiò7 why Guardiola fell out with Vilanova, Rexach says: ‘Tito had a strong character. The conflict arose when he chose to take over [from Guardiola] as first team coach. Charly Rexach claimed that Pep Guardiola and Tito Vilanova fell out over the Manchester United job . Rexach (left) is a former player and manager of Barcelona and made the claims in an interview . Vilanova, who coached Barcelona after Guardiola left, passed away from throat cancer in April last yer . ‘At first Pep seemed to understand the decision but in the end it bothered him. They both had an offer to coach Manchester [United] once Pep’s sabbatical had passed. ‘Things got worse when Tito went to a clinic in New York to received cancer treatment and Pep, who was at the time living there with his family, never visited him. Pep knew [he was there] because the two wives had bumped into each other during his time there.’ Guardiola quit Barcelona at the end of the 2011-12 season. His former number two Vilanova took over while Guardiola took a year off from football before taking over at Bayern Munich a year later. Sir Alex Ferguson walked away from Old Trafford at the end of the 2012-13 season and Rexach’s comments suggest United tried to replace Ferguson with Guardiola. In Marti Perarnau’s book about Guardiola’s first year coaching Bayern Munich 'Pep Confidential' he writes about the former Barca manager’s interest in managing at Old Trafford.. “The Catalan was impressed and told [his personal assistant] Manuel Estiarte privately: ‘I like this place. I could see myself coaching here one day,' he says of Guardiola's reaction to visiting Old Trafford. In his book Perarnau also claims Guardiola spoke to Txiki Begristain about the Manchester City job. In the Regiò7 interview Rexach refers to 'Manchester' without stating ‘City’ or ‘United’. But in Spain Manchester United is usually referred to as just ‘Manchester’ and Manchester City is normally referred to as ‘City’. Rexach claims that Guardiola and Vilanova had an offer to replace Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United . Rexach added that Guardiola learned parts of the game from the Southampton manager Ronald Koeman . Rexach also says  Guardiola learned his trade from current Southampton manager Ronaldo Koeman. He says: ‘Pep reads the game very well, he learned from Koeman who was the first player to be like a coach on the pitch. He was able to understand whatever tactical change was necessary during the game. When you are on the sidelines it is very difficult to correct the players positions on the pitch.’ Vilanova died last April after a long battle against throat cancer. He won the league at Barcelona the season he replaced Guardiola as manager.","Charlie Rexach says Pep Guardiola and Tito Vilanova received an offer from Manchester United .

"The family of a 23-year-old medical student who died after being brutally gang raped on a bus in New Delhi demanded that her attackers be hanged today as four men were convicted of her murder. Mukesh Singh, Pawan Gupta, Akshay Thakur and Vinay Sharma were all found guilty of rape, murder, assault, kidnapping, robbery, and eight other charges at Saket Court, in South Delhi, India. They were among six people accused of tricking the woman and her male companion into boarding an off-duty bus on December 16 after they had seen a matinee showing of 'Life of Pi' at a shopping mall. They then raped her using a metal bar to inflict massive internal injuries before beating her friend. The victims were dumped naked on the roadside and the woman died from her injuries two weeks later. Speaking outside court, the . father of the victim, who cannot be identified under Indian law, said: 'Now the court has held them guilty, we want them hanged. We expect nothing else but the death sentence.' Scroll down for video. 'Hang them': As the four men listened to their verdicts inside the courtroom, chants of 'hang them' could be heard outside as demonstrators called for the death penalty and staged mock hangings . Guilty! Indian policemen look out from a van carrying the four convicted men . Appeal: W.P. Singh (left, centre), defence lawyer for one of the four men, said he planned to launch an appeal on behalf of his client as protesters called for his hanging yards away (right) As the men were told the verdicts in the courtroom, chants of 'hang them' could be heard echoing outside. The . men, convicted on all the counts against them, including rape and . murder, now face the possibility of hanging. They are expected to be . sentenced tomorrow. One of the four, however, is to launch an appeal over his conviction claiming he was simply driving the bus when the attack took place and was unaware of what was happening inside. The crime, which left the victim with . such extensive internal injuries that she died two weeks later, sparked . widespread protests across the country and led to reforms of India's . antiquated sexual violence laws. Guilty: A van carries the four men to court in New Delhi. They face the death penalty following the verdict . A mother's tears: The mother of one of the four convicted men cries upon seeing the news on a court verdict on a TV inside her house at a slum in New Delhi . Their conviction comes a week after their teenage accomplice was jailed for three years for his part in the atrocity. The sixth accused was found dead in his jail cell in March. Reading out today's verdict, Judge Yogesh Khanna said the men had committed 'murder of a helpless person.' The . parents of the rape victim, who cannot be identified under Indian law, . had tears in their eyes as the verdicts were read. They sat just a few . feet from the convicted men in a tiny courtroom jammed with lawyers, . police and reporters. Convicted: It comes after a teenager was convicted in August following a separate trial . Punishment: The juvenile faces a maximum sentence of three years under Indian law . AP Singh, a lawyer for the men, said all were innocent. 'These accused have been framed simply to please the public,' he told reporters. 'This is not a fair trial. Outside . the courthouse, where dozens of protesters had gathered, a chant began . quickly after the verdict: 'Hang Them! Hang Them! Hang Them!' Protesters called the case a wake-up call for India. 'Every . girl at any age experiences this - harassment or rape. We don't feel . safe,' said law school graduate Rapia Pathania. 'That's why we're here. We want this case to be an example for every other case that has been . filed and will be filed.' The teenager, who was 17 at the time of the attack, was given the maximum sentence possible under Indian law. But despite having since turned 18, the attacker will not be publicly named. The victim's family called for the teenager to be tried as an adult, accusing him of being the most violent of the attackers. 'He . should be hanged irrespective of whether he is a juvenile or not. He . should be punished for what he did to my daughter,' said the . mother of the victim, said soon after the verdict was announced. Anger: Indian women participate in a silent procession to mourn the death of the gang rape victim . Fury: Following the attack of the young girl in New Delhi, hundreds took to the street in protest to demand swift justice, pictured . Horrific: The girl was savagely attacked when she boarded a bus with a male friend after a trip to the cinema in December . Anger: The savage assault caused outrage throughout India. Protestors are pictured trying to break through a police cordon during a demonstration in New Delh . A dream destroyed: A man bows his head at a candlelit vigil for the 23-year-old student who died after being gang-raped on a moving bus in New Delhi . 'You may as well set the juvenile free, . if the sentence is only three years for heinous offences like rape and . murder,' she added tearfully. The mother also said she would appeal against the verdict in a higher court. 'I . am not happy with this judgment. At least in this case, the juvenile . should have been sentenced to life,' the victim's brother told Reuters news agency. The government, facing immense public pressure, had promised swift justice in the case. The convicted defendant was tried as a . minor on charges including murder and rape. The time he spent in a . juvenile home since he was arrested in December will count as part of . his three-year sentence. Terror: The 23-year-old woman died after being gang raped by six men who also used a metal bar to cause massive internal injuries . The sentence is likely to cause further anger in a country attempting to . turn a rising tide of violence against women and which has passed a new . law toughening sentences for adults convicted of sex crimes . The attack set off furious protests across India about the treatment of women in the country where police say a rape is reported every 20 minutes. A government panel set to suggest reforms to sexual assault laws rejected calls to lower the age at which people can be tried as adults from 18 to 16. On July 17, India's top court also refused to reduce the age of a juvenile from 18 to 16 years. However, it later agreed to hear a new petition seeking to take the 'mental and intellectual maturity' of the defendant into account and not just age. Four of the teenager's co-accused are still on trial and face the death penalty if convicted. Closing arguments began on August 22 and verdicts are expected within the next fortnight. A fifth accused, the alleged ring-leader, killed himself in his jail cell in March. The defendant could only receive a maximum sentence of three years because he was 17 at the time of the attack . The teenager, who may not be named, was tried as a juvenile because he was 17 at the time of the attack. The maximum penalty that could be imposed by India's Juvenile Justice Board was three years. In January, authorities ruled he was 17, citing school records, which shocked the victim's family and others clamouring for him to face the death penalty. In response to the public outcry after the rape, the government fast-tracked tougher laws against sex crimes, but it resisted calls to change the juvenile law and return the adult age to 16 from 18. India's Supreme Court is currently hearing a petition filed by Subramanian Swamy, an opposition politician and lawyer, that calls for the law to be reinterpreted rather than changed. Swamy wants the 'emotional, intellectual and mental maturity' of juvenile offenders to be assessed when deciding whether to try them as a juvenile, rather than basing the decision on age alone. 'I felt that, with the kind of rape that took place, if (the juvenile suspect) got off lightly it would send a bad signal to society,' Swamy said. He plans to launch an appeal against the verdict reached today if the Supreme Court rules in favour of his petition later this year. The teenager pleaded not guilty to all 13 charges including rape, murder and robbery. His trial was held behind closed doors to protect his identity and media were barred from reporting on any details of the proceedings. During his trial, he has been held at a juvenile detention facility for violent young offenders in Delhi and kept away from other inmates for his safety. The youth left home when he was 11 and got work in a roadside eatery, his mother said in January. In recent years he lived as a semi-vagrant, washing buses and collecting fares, according to a police report. After leaving home, he never returned and his mother said she thought he was dead until police arrested him in connection with the gang-rape. Some 33,000 crimes were committed by juveniles in India last year, the highest number in a decade, but there has not been a large spike, according to Home Ministry figures. Juveniles commit a tiny proportion of total crimes in India and far less than other nations such as the United States.","Victim, 23, died after being gang-raped by six men on bus in New Delhi .

The President said 'the world is not doing enough' to counter the threat posed by Ebola. Scroll down for video . US President Barack Obama complained that the world has not done enough to counter the Ebola threat . Obama has authorised additional spending to battle the virus which is spreading rapidly in West Africa . Medics in west Africa are trying to isolate suspected Ebola cases to prevent the spread of the disease . The president also offered thoughts and prayers to a Dallas nurse being treated for Ebola after she helped care for a Liberian man who died from the disease. Obama says he wants lessons learned from that case to be applied to hospitals around the country. Since the president's announcement, a second nurse who treated US Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan has been diagnosed with the disease. It is understood that Obama will seek additional funds from congress to battle the disease. So far, the US has committed more than $1 billion in federal funds. Congress is expected to consider proposals to increase the aid effort once it reconvenes next month. White House Budget Director Shaun Donovan said: 'Our expectation is that we will be talking to Congress about additional needs.' Among the money already committed, $30 million has been promised to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Also, an additional $750 million has been allocated to the Defense Department to support military efforts in countering Ebola. The Pentagon  had asked Congress to move $1 billion earmarked for war fighting to counter Ebola. US troops are set to be deployed in West Africa to support civil authorities in countering the deadly outbreak. In a bid to secure a global response to the Ebola crisis, President Obama will host a video conference with world leaders to discuss the outbreak.

"The judge in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius said on Friday that she will give a verdict on September 11, ending a televised trial that stretched for five months and transfixed South Africans and others around the world. Judge Thokozile Masipa made the announcement after the prosecution and the defense ended final arguments in the murder case against the double-amputee athlete, who shot dead girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Pistorius said he mistakenly shot Steenkamp through the closed door of a toilet cubicle, thinking there was an intruder in his home. The prosecution alleges the Olympic runner intentionally killed her after an argument on Valentine's Day last year. Centre of attention: Photographs and residents flock around Oscar Pistorius as he leave court . On trial: Oscar Pistorius walks past Reeva Steenkamp's parents in court . 'The accused intended to kill a human being,' chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel said. 'There must be consequences.' Nel has urged the judge to dismiss Pistorius' entire story as an elaborate lie and to convict him of premeditated murder, a charge that carries a sentence of at least 25 years and up to life in prison. South Africa does not have trial by jury, nor does it have the death penalty. Pistorius could also be convicted of a lesser murder charge or negligent killing, both of which call for years in jail. Judge Masipa could acquit him if she believes he only made a tragic error. Feeling the strain: Oscar Pistorius had his head in his hands as the court heard evidence . Barry Roux, the chief defense lawyer, said Pistorius' disability had made him particularly vulnerable and anxious about crime over the years, comparing him to a victim of abuse who kills an abuser after a long period of suffering. Pistorius' had his lower legs amputated as a baby, and Roux argued that the athlete's long-held fear of being attacked with the disability played a central role in an accidental killing. Pistorius pleaded not guilty to murder and three separate firearm charges. Roux, however, conceded that he was guilty in one of those firearm charges, of negligently firing a gun in a public place in an incident in a restaurant weeks before the killing. Prosecutors have used those firearm charges to paint Pistorius as a hothead who was obsessed with guns, not the vulnerable figure his defense puts forward.","Judge will deliver her verdict on September 11 .

"Real Madrid and Barcelona will not have to share revenue from La Liga television rights after the Spanish government backed out of a plan to bring in a law that would force them to do so. Spain’s big two between them take £204million of the total £550m pot every season and the other clubs, who wanted legislation to force them to reduce their share, are now considering going on strike if the government don't lift their block on the new law being passed. The rest of Europe was also keen to see the new law because Madrid and Barça earn far more than some of their main Champions League rivals from television deals. Real Madrid and Barcelona will continue to pocket the vast majority of La Liga's TV sponsorship . The likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi continue to attract large TV audiences due to their stature . The combined TV earnings from Europe's top leagues last season - led by the Premier League . In Germany, Bayern Munich earned around £27m in the 2013-14 season from the Bundesliga contract, Juventus earned £67m and PSG 32. In England, on the other hand, Liverpool were the top earners with £99m closely followed by Manchester City on £98m – both behind Real Madrid and Barcelona. Spain sports minister Miguel Cardenal had been keen to wave through a change but he has been overruled leaving the other clubs furious and, according to Diario AS, set to meet next week to discuss the possibility of stopping the league with strike action. In the 2013-14 season Cardiff earned less than any other Premier League club, £64m and yet still made more than twice as much as La Liga winners Atletico Madrid in Spain who earned £31m from television revenue. Valencia earn the third highest amount in Spanish football but the £35m they pick up per season is still dwarfed by that £102 premium given to both Real Madrid and Barcelona. Liverpool earned the most amount of TV money in the Premier League last season . Bayern Munich earned just over £27m in TV sponsorship last season while Juventus came out in top in Italy . At Real Sociedad, David Moyes’ club must cope on just £18m a season while as many as five clubs in the 2013-14 season in Spain only made £13m. Real Madrid and Barcelona had both indicated they would be prepared to give up their advantage but the other clubs wanted it written in the statutes to avoid close season bickering every time a deal was up for renewal. The other clubs had assured Madrid and Barcelona they would still get €140m because by joint-bargaining the total money made from the first combined deal would move up from £550 closer to £730m by that dream now looks in tatters. Clubs will go on negotiating deals separately with Real Madrid and Barcelona both having already agreed deals for next season again over the of £100m mark.","La Liga giants Real Madrid and Barcelona take majority of TV pot in Spain .

"A best man accused of brutally stabbing his friend and killing his pal's wife was so close to the couple he dined at their house every week and even went on vacation with them, it has emerged. Jamie Kirk Hahn, 29, died on Wednesday from injuries she suffered when she and her husband, 27-year-old Nation Hahn, were stabbed at their home in Raleigh, North Carolina on Monday night. Jonathan Broyhill, 31, a close friend of the couple who had previously worked with Jamie and acted as Nation's best man at their wedding, has been arrested and charged with attempted murder. Mr Hahn, a well-known strategist in North Carolina political circles, was released from WakeMed Hospital after treatment and was seen with a bandaged arm as he went to his wife's bedside. Happier times: Jon Broyhill (left) has been accused of fatally stabbing his best friend's wife, Jamie Kirk Hahn (center). Her husband, Nation Hahn (right), was also injured in the attack on Monday . On Wednesday, he wrote a string of emotional tweets to pay tribute to his young wife. 'I have no idea what I'm going to do with @jamiehahn,' he wrote. 'She was my center, my rock and my soulmate... It is almost unfathomable that the sun can shine without [her] here.' Friends told the Charlotte Observer how, on Monday nights, the three close friends would meet at the Hahn's home for dinner, but tragedy unfolded during this week's meet up. An unidentified woman called 911 around 5.30pm Monday to report that Jamie was 'bleeding terribly' from multiple stab wounds to the abdomen as she lay in a neighbor's yard. 'Murdered': Jon Broyhill is pictured left with Mrs Hahn and right in his mug shot after allegedly stabbing her . Ripped apart: The couple, who were both well known in political circles in North Carolina, married in 2009 . 'I don't know where she ran here from,' the woman said, adding that many people had gathered to press towels against her stomach. The dispatcher asked the caller who had carried out the stabbing, and a voice responded: 'Jon Broyhill', the Observer reported. When police arrived on the scene, they followed a trail of blood back to Tealwood Place and found Broyhill inside the Hahns' home, authorities said. Broyhill was also sent to WakeMed to . recover from non-life threatening injuries, which are self-inflicted, according to WNCT. Heartbroken: Nation Hahn expressed his grief and thanks on Twitter after his wife died on Wednesday . Police have charged Broyhill with . attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill . inflicting serious injury, but have not revealed a motive. Facebook images show the close . relationship the three shared - enjoying watching sports games at home . and traveling abroad to share holidays. On Wednesday, the community paid tribute to the bright, popular woman, who had set up her own business, Sky Blue Strategies, to help politicians and campaigns fundraise. She and her husband both graduated from UNC Chapel Hill and were married in 2009. 'Jamie lost her struggle to live this . morning. We lost a beautiful and loving wife, daughter and friend. We . all lost a pure and brave spirit,' her family said in a statement early on Wednesday morning. Active: Jamie was a political fundraiser with her own company, while her husband was a Democratic strategist . Released: Before his wife's death, Mr Hahn was pictured walking to her hospital with his arm bound . 'Jamie is a ray of sunshine,' state Sen. Josh Stein, who knew all three, said. 'She's always smiling. She . absolutely brings cheer wherever she goes, and that this has happened is . tragic.' 'As a friend, this is devastating,' friend Gary Pearce told the Observer. 'Nation and Jamie are the finest, . kindest, gentlest and most generous people you will ever meet.' Following the tragedy, Nation Hahn talked about his wife at Pullen Memorial. 'She would be the first one to forgive this act of violence against her,' he said. According to the Observer, in 2010 . Broyhill managed the field campaign for Jane Dyer, a pilot in South . Carolina who was running for a U.S. congressional seat. Always around: Neighbors of the couple say that Boyhill's car was always seen parked outside their home, pictured, so much so that they thought he lived there . He also worked with former U.S. Rep. Brad Miller of Raleigh. Nation Hahn worked on former U.S. Sen. John Edwards' presidential campaign and has also helped as an online strategist and with mail campaigns.

"Walmart today announced it is raising wages for 40percent of its 1.3 million employees as the embattled company tries to reshape the image that its stores offer dead-end jobs. The company - the biggest private employer in the nation - announced on Thursday that it is funneling $1 billion into how it pays and trains its workers. As part of the changes, entry level wages will be raised to at least $9 an hour by April - which is $1.75 above the federal minimum wage - and then $10 by next February. But while the changes are a move in the right direction, they fall far short of demands by labor groups, which have long protested for Walmart to raise its starting hourly wages to $15 and give employees more consistent hours. Scroll down for video . Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon is pictured during an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday as he announces the company's plans to spend $1 billion to change how it pays and trains staff . With the changes, the average full-time wage for workers will be $13 an hour, up from $12.85, the Associated Press reported. For part-time workers, the hourly wage will be $10, up from $9.48. That's below the $14.65 average that hourly retail workers in a non-supervisory role earn, according to government data that includes people who work at auto dealers and other outlets that would likely pay more than discounters like Walmart. But it's also above the $9.93 average hourly pay for cashiers and low level retail sales staff, according to Hay Group's survey of 140 retailers with annual sales of $500 million. About 500,000 workers will receive the raises as part of the company's $1 billion investment. On Thursday, OUR Walmart, which has long been protesting for the company to give its employees full-time hours and a wage of $15 an hour, responded to the news on its Facebook page. 'Big day for OUR Walmart!' it wrote. 'Today Walmart responded to our call for higher pay and more consistent schedules. They are committing to raise pay for 500,000 associates by raising the minimum pay to $9 per hour this year and $10 next year and and also raising the floor and ceiling for most current pay bands. 'This doesn't get most of us to $15 and FT (full-time) but it shows that by standing together and taking action we can make big change at Walmart. Ongoing battle: People can be seen protesting low wages outside a Walmart store in Chicago last November . 'Today when we go to work let's tell our co-workers what we have accomplished and invite them to join us in making even bigger change at Walmart.' Walmart follows other retailers that have boosted hourly pay recently, but because it's the nation's largest private employer, the impact of its move will be more closely watched. In addition to raises, Walmart said it plans to make changes to how workers are scheduled and add training programs for sales staff so that employees can more easily map out their future at the company. 'We are trying to create a meritocracy where you can start somewhere and end up just as high as your hard work and your capacity will enable you to go,' CEO Doug McMillon told the AP during an interview this week at the company's headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas. The changes, which Wal-Mart announced on Thursday as it reported fourth quarter results, come at a time when there's growing concern for the plight of the nation's hourly workers. Thousands of hourly workers and their supporters have staged protests across the country in the past couple of years to call attention to their financial struggles. Business groups and politicians have jumped into the fray, debating a proposal by President Obama to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour. And a new Associated Press-GfK poll found that most Americans support increasing the minimum wage. At the same time, the competition for retail workers is becoming increasingly stiff. As shoppers get more mobile savvy, retailers are seeking sales staff that's more skilled at customer service. But in the improving economy, the most desirable retail workers feel more confident in hopping from job to job. Wal-Mart, which has struggled for two years with sluggish sales, follows other big retailers that have announced plans to increase pay for its workers. Swedish home furnishings retailer Ikea this year gave thousands of workers at its U.S. division a 17 percent average raise to $10.76 an hour.  And clothing chain Gap Inc. raised its minimum hourly wage of employees to $9 last year and $10 this year. Ed Lazear, a Stanford University economics professor who served as an informal adviser to Wal-Mart during the past year for the program, applauded Wal-Mart's moves. 'It's positioning itself to be competitive,' he said. 'This is a step in the right direction.'","Walmart is spending $1 billion to make changes to how it pays and trains its hourly workers in its biggest ever overhaul .
It will boost wages for 40 percent of its 1.3 million employees and entry wages will be raised to $9 by April - which is $1.75 above minimum wage .
It has long faced pressure from labor groups to raise the starting hourly wages to $15 - but the move falls short of their demands .
Still, labor group OUR Walmart applauded the company for making a move in the right direction .
Programs will be rolled out for fixed schedules and hands-on training ."

Ronaldo sent John O'Shea 'into dizzy spells' Keane admits he does not regret his horror tackle on Alf-Inge Haaland . Roy Keane has slammed Sir Alex Ferguson for his dispute with John Magnier over the horse Rock of Gibraltar. The legendary Manchester United boss was embroiled in a legal battle over the ownership of the champion racehorse with Magnier - who was part of the Cubic Expression investment group, United's biggest shareholders until the takeover by the Glazer family. Now Keane, in his new autobiography Second Half, has criticised his former manager for his role in the scandal. Sir Alex Ferguson (right) pictured with Rock of Gibraltar and jockey Michael Kinane at Royal Ascot in 2002 . Keane (left) and Ferguson walk off following a match between Sunderland and Manchester United in 2007 . 'He [Ferguson] was just a mascot for them - ""look at me, how big I am"" - and he didn't even own the bloody thing,' wrote Keane. Ferguson and Magnier settled out of court, with the former manager accepting a £2.5million one-off payment. Keane has also revealed he launched an expletive-laden rant at Ferguson which ultimately led to his departure from Old Trafford. Keane spectacularly fell out with Fergie following the then captain's harsh words during an interview with MUTV - which earned the Irishman a £5,000 fine from the club. Keane reveals that assistant Carlos Queiroz accused him of showing a lack of loyalty to his team-mates after his MUTV interview in which he tore into a number of the then United stars. Ferguson stepped in to quell the row, saying: 'That’s enough. I’ve had enough of all this stuff. Keane responded by saying: 'You as well gaffer. We need f****** more from you. We need a bit more, gaffer. We're slipping behind other teams.' When goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar chipped in and suggested Keane could have used a 'different tone' the reply was robust. 'Edwin, why don’t you shut the f*** up? You’ve been at this club for two minutes and you’ve done more interviews than I’ve done in my 12 years. It was MUTV – I had to do it.' Like our Manchester United Facebook page. 'Once we were at Juventus – they were playing Chelsea. We were standing at the corner flag and Adrian (Chiles) was next to me. He goes: ""This is great isn’t it?"". I went: ""I used to play in these games Adrian"". I wasn’t being cocky. 'It’s about justification, what you stand for. When I was at United I was getting paid good money but I could go: ""Yeah, but I'm giving it back to you"". I didn’t feel that way with this TV work. It’s an easy gig. I don’t like easy gigs. When I heard: ""I liked your commentary last night"". I knew I was only talking bulls*** like the rest of them. Hopefully my bulls*** was a bit better. I wanted to do something that excited me. TV work didn’t excite me. 'I liked Adrian and Lee Dixon, though. What I really enjoyed was the company. I liked meeting people, old players like Liverpool’s Jan Molby. Some United fans saw us together and one of them said: “Why the f*** are you talking to him?”. I felt like saying: “I will speak to who I f***ing want to!""' 'I wonder about the current United dressing room. When a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson is replaced the new man needs a helping hand. Does that mean every player should like him? No. 'But I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better. Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best. 'Looking at what happened to David Moyes, I can only conclude that he didn’t have a strong dressing room. He had a weak dressing room.'

"Fate in the balance: Bardwil waits before his hearing at Manhattan's Supreme Court . A millionaire businessman who threatened a burglar inside his home with a gun is facing three years in jail because he did not have a license for the weapon. George Bardwil, who owns linen company Bardwil Home, was at home in his E. 51st Street apartment in Manhattan in January, when a man broke in.

"The moon has been orbiting Earth for more than four billion years. But our planet’s faithful companion may not be alone. A new object, dubbed 2014 OL339, has been found masquerading as Earth’s ‘second moon’. The new ‘moon’, which is in fact a 490ft (150 metre) asteroid, takes about a year to orbit the sun and is close enough to Earth to look like its satellite. Scroll down for animation . A new object, dubbed 2014 OL339, has been found masquerading as Earth’s ‘second moon’.The new ‘moon’, which is in fact a 490ft (150 metre) asteroid, takes about a year to orbit the sun and is close enough to Earth to look like its satellite. Pictured is its elliptical orbit . The peculiar object was accidentally discovered on July 29 by astronomer Farid Char of the Chilean University of Antofagasta. According to Rebecca Boyle writing in New Scientist, 2014 OL339 has been travelling near to our planet for about 775 years and it will continue to do so for another 165 years. It has an elliptical orbit and takes around 364.92 days to circle the sun once, meaning the asteroid and Earth are in ‘resonant orbits’. This happens when two orbiting bodies exert a gravitational influence on each other due to their orbits being closely related. For instance, Pluto and Neptune are in an orbital resonance of 2:3. This means for every two times Pluto goes around the sun, Neptune makes three trips around the star. Asteroid 2014 OL339 orbits the sun in a similar timeframe to Earth, but our planet’s gravity pushes it into an eccentric wobble. Nasa has plans to capture an asteroid and bring it closer to Earth for astronauts to study. And in a series of new papers, which can be found here, the agency has revealed just how - and why - it might be done. Nasa’s ultimate goal is to send humans to Mars, and they say the Asteroid Redirect Mission (Arm) will be an important stepping stone towards getting there. A number of new spaceflight capabilities will be tested in the 2020s as part of the mission, which will involve redirecting an asteroid to orbit the moon and sending humans to explore it. Nasa plans to launch an Arm robotic spacecraft to rendezvous with, capture and redirect an asteroid by the end of this decade. The spacecraft will redirect it to a stable orbit around the moon called a 'Distant Retrograde Orbit' - one that orbits the moon very widely, coming quite close before extending out much further away. Astronauts aboard Nasa's Orion spacecraft, launched from the upcoming Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, will then explore the asteroid in the mid-2020s at the furthest point in its controlled orbit around the moon. Looking up with powerful telescopes from Earth, OL339 appears as though it is in orbit around our planet, moving backwards relative to the stars. A number of other space rocks have fallen into orbits that make them look as though they are circling the Earth. Like 2014 OL339, many of these take around one year to orbit the sun in elliptical orbits, according to Phil Plait writing in the Bad Astronomy blog. The most famous is 3753 Cruithne, a three-mile (5km) asteroid that was discovered in 1986. However, it wasn’t until 1997 that scientists uncovered its unusual path. Our planet has also had a number of ‘minimoons’, which are small asteroids that are affected by Earth's gravitational pull and orbit the planet, but for a much shorter timeframe. These minimoon are often only a few feet across, and each tends to do a stint of around a year in orbit - before resuming their previous lives as asteroids. Scientists hope to one day 'catch' a quasi-satellite which could offer a valuable sample of material largely unchanged since the dawn of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago. In 2012, a team led by University of Hawaii at Manoa calculated the probability that at any given time Earth has more than one moon. They used a supercomputer to simulate the passage of 10 million asteroids past Earth. They concluded at anyone one time, there should be at least one asteroid with a diameter of at least one meter orbiting Earth. Scientists hope to one day 'catch' a quasi-satellite which could offer a valuable sample of material largely unchanged since the dawn of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago.

It’s traditionally siesta time all over Spain and they have been caught napping on the job enough times in their five mid-afternoon kick-offs to have dropped five of a possible 15 points. But there was no such snoozing against strugglers Granada and they were ahead after 25 minutes when the home side failed to deal with a Suarez cross-shot and the ball ran out to Rakitic who buried it past former Barca B keeper Oier Olazabal. Gerard Pique was missing through suspension and Barcelona had Neymar booked in the second half. He will now miss their next league game against Rayo Vallecano. But both players will be happy to have got their suspensions out of the way ahead of next month’s clasico. Luis Suarez said this week: ‘Madrid have to come to the Camp Nou. We can still close the gap’ and he was doing everything to help that cause getting his tenth goal in a Barcelona shirt on 48 minutes. He started the move playing in Rakitic and he was slipped through by the Croatian midfielder to finish past Oier. Barcelona made things a little more difficult for themselves by giving away a second-half penalty. Marc Bartra fouled Lass and Fran Rico scored the spot-kick but Barcelona scored again to wrap up the three points. When it came it was Suarez’ 13th assist of the season. Again Rakitic was at the heart of the goal playing in the Uruguayan who rolled the ball to Messi. The Argentine finished into an empty net and the Granada players complained with some justification, about the absence of an off-side flag. Suarez was embraced by Messi. He then showed his frustration when taken off with 10 minutes left. He could be seen shaking his head on the bench after being deprived of the chance to add to his tally. He has made his name at Barcelona as a goal-giver but for the second game running his goal had been decisive in a Barcelona victory.

"Nasri can expose Alves . ‘He was thinking about his next Instagram pose’ was how one Catalan match report described Dani Alves’ error that led to Malaga’s winner on Saturday. The Brazilian has been accused of letting the showbusiness replace the real business on the pitch during recent seasons. Samir Nasri will lead the charge down City’s left. He does not have the raw speed of Jesus Navas, who will zoom down the right, but the Frenchman has more than enough in his locker to take advantage of any lapses Alves may have. Samir Nasri celebrates after firing Manchester City further ahead in Saturday's 5-0 win over Newcastle . Dani Alves (right), in action against Malaga at the weekend, will have a tough job marking Nasri on Tuesday . Aguero can leave Mascherano trailing . Coach Luis Enrique saw enough during the World Cup to be reminded of just how good a midfielder Mascherano is. But needs must at Barcelona and with Thomas Vermaelen still injured, the Argentine still finds himself at centre-back. His aerial limitations are obvious, while he can be too cavalier in his tackling. Sergio Aguero will know his compatriot’s game inside out and the worry for Barcelona is that Aguero has just started to find his rhythm; he has the appetite to do to Barcelona what he did to Bayern Munich in November. Sergio Aguero, scoring against Bayern Munich in the group stages, will be a huge threat to Barcelona . Iniesta is off the boil . For a player of his enormous talent, Iniesta doesn’t score enough. And a startling statistic is that he has no goals or assists in La Liga so far this campaign. With Xavi in decline he needed to take control of Barcelona’s midfield. So far he hasn’t. City, however, will be wary. Iniesta provided the glorious pass that led to the penalty in the corresponding game next season. With Yaya Toure unavailable, Fernando and Fernandinho will have to keep their wits about them. Iniesta, before Barcelona training at the Etihad Stadium on Monday, has bee out of form recently . The keeper is rusty . Barca’s German keeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen was signed by Barcelona’s Sporting Director Andoni Zubizarreta to replace Victor Valdes. He is excellent with his feet, great at making one on one saves and commands his area well, but there is a problem: Stegen only plays cup games because Enrique favours Chilean Claudio Bravo. He could be undercooked. Should David Silva get on the ball frequently, City could have plenty of opportunities to test how rusty Stegen is. Barca’s German keeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen is only usually played in up games and could be rusty . Pellegrini can win the tactical battle . Luis Enrique is condemned to be forever compared unfavourably with Pep Guardiola. They both played for Barcelona and both coached the youth side before the first team. For many, the similarities stop there. Guardiola’s ability to change games mid-match does not seem to be a quality Enrique possesses. After going 1-0 down against Malaga he made three changes but the substitutions seemed to confuse Barcelona more than their opponents. City will hope to exploit this.

"Amir Khan fears the £200million mega-fight between Floyd Mayweather Jnr and Manny Pacquiao will be boring. The long-awaited clash between two of the best boxers in the world is set to be announced for May 2 in Las Vegas after almost six years of failed negotiations. But Khan is concerned that the delay means the fans will be left feeling short changed. Amir Khan fears the mega-fight between Floyd Mayweather Jnr and Manny Pacquiao will be boring . 'I think it will be a good fight for a couple of rounds,' he said. 'You never know, Mayweather might get old overnight. He's shown he's getting caught more so he's not invincible. 'Pacquiao had speed, explosiveness and power so I think he will give him a lot of problems early but I think Mayweather will just move on and drift away by picking him off with clean shots and frustrate him. 'I think it will go the distance but that Mayweather will win by unanimous decision. 'Four years ago it would have been a massive fight because both of them were at their peak. It might have gone past that now and it's not going to be what people expect. Mayweather last fought when he beat Marcos Maidana in their rematch last September . 'It could be a boring fight if both of them try to box each other. Some people have such high hopes for the fight but it could be boring. 'I don't think Manny would try to make it boring but Mayweather would. Four or five years ago it would have been a bigger fight than it is now, it won't be as exciting.' Khan had hoped to face either man himself this year but must now look elsewhere. The Bolton welterweight still plans to fight in May and hopes to finalise an opponent in the next week. Pacquiao was last in action when he dominated Chris Algieri over 12 rounds in Macau last November . But he remains convinced he would pose a tougher test for Mayweather than Pacquiao. 'I really believe I have the style to give Mayweather the biggest problems,' he added. 'Pacquiao is good and it's a fight people want to see but the style I have would give him more problems. 'I'm long, I'm tall and I've got that range, speed and power, everything Mayweather hates. 'The top boxers in the world from Sugar Ray Leonard to Tommy Hearns and Marvin Hagler have said Amir Khan is the only guy can who can beat Mayweather.'

"Why was anyone surprised? Cristiano Ronaldo ended talk of a scoring drought by netting his 58th Champions League goal for Real Madrid in 58 games for the club to help Real Madrid to a 2-0 win over Roberto di Matteo’s Schalke. It was the 12th consecutive away game in the Champions League that Ronaldo had scored in and he set up Marcelo in the second half to put the game beyond the Germans. Ronaldo had not scored in his last three games. He hadn’t gone four games without scoring for four years but he rose to head past Schalke’s 19-year-old keeper Timon Wellenreuther to put Real Madrid in-front in the first half. Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 58th Champions League goal for Real Madrid as his side earned a 2-0 win against Schalke . The Portuguese forward finds himself unmarked in the Schalke penalty area before heading past goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther . Pepe, Toni Kroos and Gareth Bale watch as Ronaldo's header floats towards the back of Wellenreuther's net . Madrid's No 7 ended his mini goal drought which lasted just four hours and 59 minutes . Dani Carvajal looks an as Ronaldo leaps into his trademark celebration in front of the Schalke faithful . Ronaldo's first half header was his 58th goal in 58 Champions League games for the La Liga side .

Booked: Boateng, Neustadter, Kirchoff . Real Madrid: Casillas, Marcelo, Pepe, Varane, Carvajal (Arbeloa 81), Silva, Kroos, Isco (Illarramendi 84), Bale, Benzema (Hernandez 78), Ronaldo . Subs not used: Navas, Nacho, Jese, Medran . Booked: Kroos . Goals: Ronaldo 25, Marcelo 78 . The holders were not happy about being forced to wear pink – the last time they played in their garish third kit they lost 4-2 to Real Sociedad and had wanted to play in their all-black second strip only for Uefa to deem it clashed with Schalke's blue and white. They needn’t have worried – this was more 'back to the fuschia' than the 'shocking in pink' display they delivered in Anoeta in August. The did make a nervous start however with Toni Kroos, English referee Martin Atkinson’s first booking and Lucas Silva – the 22-year-old Brazilian making his debut in midfield – almost following him with a foul on the edge of the area that Klass-Jan Huntelaar smashed into the wall. Schalke were soaking up Madrid pressure and creating chances themselves with Dennis Aogo blasting over after finding more time and space than Carlo Ancelotti would have been happy with down the Real Madrid right. The left wing-back also caught Ronaldo and left him temporarily hobbling but the Portuguese got back into his stride and put Real Madrid in front. Right back Dani Carvajal got forward down the right and sent a hanging cross to the edge of the Schalke six-yard-box. The Germans had three central defenders on the pitch but none of them tracked Ronaldo who climbed to nod past Wellenreuther. Benzema could have made it two from Kroos’ pass but was denied by the teenage goalkeeper but things were now going downhill fast for Schalke. Huntelaar limped off after a shin-pad to shin-pad crunch with Raphael Varane and Kevin Prince Boateng was booked meaning he will miss the second leg next month. The Madrid players join Ronaldo in celebration of the away side's opening goal in Gelsenkirchen . Atsuto Uchida was inches away from pulling Schalke back into the game, but his sweet strike smashed against the crossbar . Uchida reacts after seeing his fierce strike cannon off the crossbar before eventually falling into Iker Casillas' arms . Brazilian defender Marcelo fires the visitors into a commanding 2-0 lead with a memorable strike in Germany . The 26-year-old is closed down by Howedes but the defender's efforts came too late to stop Marcelo's shot . Marcelo darts towards Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti in celebration of his stunning solo effort . Ronaldo very nearly doubled his tally but Wellenreuther saved well from a fiercely struck free-kick and although Ancelotti could be seen urging Karim Benzema to track back he must have been happy with a first half performance that ended with Gareth Bale getting into the game with a jinking run down the Madrid right. This was never going to be the 6-1 victory that Madrid chalked up last season with Bale, Benzema and Ronaldo all scoring twice last season but the European Champions were in control. Isco released Ronaldo at the start of the second half and he almost found Benzema as Real Madrid looked to kill the game off. Bale then crossed from the right but Wellenreuther gathered comfortably. Schalke looked short of ideas and not too upset with a 1-0 first leg reverse. Real knew another goal would all but put them through. Bale was not helping them in that cause failing to pick out Ronaldo in one counter-attack. There was a supportive round of applause from the Portuguese when Bale’s pass was played behind him. Ronaldo was then almost gifted another free-header in the Schalke area but Wellenreuther cut out the cross before it reached him unmarked at the back post. Isco was then flicked through by Bale but he sent his shot just over. The Los Blancos stars surround the Brazilian full-back after his finish gave Madrid their second away goal of the night . Marcelo's second half goal gives Madrid a comfortable 2-0 aggregate scoreline ahead of the second leg in March .

Ancelotti complains to the fourth official as Madrid look to earn a crucial away win against Schalke . And Madrid almost paid for the missed opportunities to double their lead when Felix Platte rattled Casillas’ bar from Boateng’s cross after Marcelo had been caught in possession. That was a wake-up call for Madrid to get the second in spectacular style. Ronaldo dribbled his way infield from the Madrid left and Marcelo’s right-foot rocket nestled in the top corner to put the match and tie beyond Di Matteo’s team. The Brazilian raced away to celebrate with his coach Ancelotti. The Italian had been whistled by the mindless minority in Madrid’s last game but he remains on course to guide Real in to the quarter-finals. They will have to improve to win the competition but they had comfortably enough to beat the fourth best team in the Bundesliga. Casillas’ 150th Champions League appearance had been largely without incident and Ronaldo had got back among the goals. The Balon d’Or’s ‘barren’ spell is now behind him and Real had even buried the curse of that pink kit.

"Cooling off: Showers costing more than £100,000 were installed for ministers and officials to freshen up before work . The taxpayer has spent more than £100,000 on smart new showers for sweaty ministers and officials to freshen up after cycling to work. The Department for Energy and Climate Change splashed out on a suite of smart ‘shower rooms’ for staff as part of a £300,000 makeover of its Whitehall building. It also included almost £70,000 on new kitchens, causing Labour to ask: ‘How many kettles does a minister need?’ As one of the newest departments, created by Gordon Brown in 2008, it already has some of the smartest government offices. But climate change minister Greg Barker has admitted the department has spent £321,000 in the last two years on ‘smaller refurbishments’. Almost a third of the bill was for ‘various shower installations to improve facilities for cyclists’, ministers have admitted. The £104,127 shower rooms were ordered . after eco-friendly officials were encouraged to cycle to work last . summer to avoid rush how queues during the London Olympics. It is thought staff were unhappy at . the sight of sweaty cyclists arriving for work at 3 Whitehall Place . without having had a shower. But Labour vice-chairman Michael . Dugher, who obtained the figures, told MailOnline: ‘On average people . are £1,500 worse off since David Cameron came to power and yet ministers . in one department have blown nearly a third of a million pounds on . tarting up their facilities. ‘Over £100,000 on new showers for ministers seems shockingly steep,’ the MP for Barnsley East said. ‘What were they, gold-plated taps? Perhaps I can recommend a plumber from Barnsley who could do the job . cheaper than that next time.’ Staff were encouraged to ride to the Whitehall offices during the 2012 Olympics - but needed somewhere to shower afterwards . Climate change minister said the refurbishment was needed to address 'wear and tear' Mr Dugher added: ‘Spending almost £70,000 on kitchens seems equally extravagant. How many kettles do ministers need?’ The total refurbishment bill also included £10,000 for the ‘creation’ of an office, £2,800 decorating a basement, almost £18,5000 on painting the floors of a basement, £91,000 on ‘decoration works’, £21,200 on flooring replacements, £2,446.2 on skirting boards. Tory climate change minister Greg Barker said: 'DECC have not undertaken any large scale building refurbishment work in the last 24 months but has carried out smaller refurbishment projects, primarily to redecorate after wear and tear or to increase the capacity and efficiency of the estate.' Matthew Sinclair, chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: ‘This is a massive amount of taxpayers’ cash to splash out on refurbishments. ‘Departments across Whitehall can not afford to spend this much on renovations at a time when budgets are tight. ‘It’s important that DECC finds the best deal possible to provide value for taxpayers’ money.’ A DECC spokesperson said: ‘A number of shower rooms have been created in the Department to respond to the increased number of staff cycling to work. ‘The costs of creating the shower rooms include flooring, tiling and plumbing of the shower cubicles and each of their adjoining changing areas.’","Department for Energy and Climate Change orders £300,000 refurbishment .

"The compare and contrast makes miserable reading for Real Madrid supporters. Going into the World Club Championship back in December the team was on a run of 21 straight wins. They had scored 79 goals in the process and conceded just ten. Cristiano Ronaldo had scored 25 goals in the first 15 games of the season with Messi trailing in his wake 12 goals behind. With new signings Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez a huge success Carlo Ancelotti’s only problem was keeping everyone happy as he tried to fit all his stars into the starting XI. When they beat San Lorenzo to win in Marrakech they were crowned World Club champions and there were few who contested their status as the best team on the planet. Cristiano Ronaldo looks dejected after Real Madrid fell embarrassingly to local rivals Atletico Madrid . The Spanish giants celebrate their World Club Championship win over San Lorenzo back in December . Sport said Real were 'humiliated' against Atletico . Fast forward to the return of Champions League football and they are no longer the favourites to win the competition having been overtaken by Bayern. The team Ancelotti will field in the Veltins Arena against Schalke on Wednesday will be much weaker than the side he was able to pick in December and leading scorer Ronaldo has found the net just three times since the turn of the year. Even before Christmas Madrid’s coaching staff were concerned about a possible dip at the start of the new year. They knew that the World Club Cup meant two extra fixtures (made three by a winter break friendly against AC Milan). Ancelotti and his assistants also knew that there were certain players who were running close to empty having had big World Cup tournaments in the summer and played too many games since. And the fixture calendar had not been kind pairing them with Valencia and three times against Atletico Madrid – twice in the Cup and once away in the league. Real Madrid lost three of those four games. Stats courtesy of Squawka . Real goalkeeper Iker Casillas is back in the supporters' bad books after his slip in the 4-0 defeat by Atletico . In goal Iker Casillas’ mistake for the first goal in 4-0 league defeat to Atletico means he is being whistled again by his own supporters. In front of him the defence is creaking. Without the hamstrung Sergio Ramos there is no one to bring the ball out from the back and with Pepe missing there has been a lack of defensive organisation too. Ancelotti might have to repeat the inexperienced pairing of Nacho and Varane on Tuesday against Schalke although Pepe is racing to get back in time to play the game. The midfield trio of Kroos, Rodriguez and Luca Modric has been hit by injury with the latter two both missing. At first the absence of the Croatian former Spurs midfielder was not felt too much but with Kroos tiring from having to play every game he has been missed more than ever in the last few games. Summer arrival Toni Kroos (centre) has had to hold the fort for the injured James Rodriguez and Luka Modric . Ronaldo (right) was criticised after he was pictured celebrating his 30th birthday after the loss to Atletico . Ancelotti has little faith in Asier Illaramendi who the club signed for €30m two years ago from Real Sociedad so winter signing Lucas Silva might have to be pitched in against Schalke. Up-front Ronaldo’s misfiring has been the biggest cause for concern. He gave Leo Messi an ‘I’m coming for you’ message at the Balon d’Or ceremony at the start of the year but he has only scored four goals in his last 10 games and Messi is now just two goals behind him in the goalscoring charts. So much for the theory that having scored 25 goals in 15 games Ronaldo could finish the season with 70 goals. On the plus side Real Madrid are in the capable hands of Ancelotti who has steered many a big team through this mid-season crisis. Not that there is much love for him from the Bernabeu where he was booed when his name was read out at the weekend. There is also the plus of the form of Isco who was again outstanding at the weekend in the unconvincing win over Deportivo. Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale and Pepe (left to right) celebrate their European romping of Schalke last season . And perhaps most encouragingly for their supporters the precedents from last year in terms of matches between Schalke and Real are very positive. In February 2014 Madrid beat Schalke 6-1 in Gelsenkirchen with the BBC – Bale, Benzema and Crisitano – all scoring twice. Madrid are on a run of 19 straight wins in the Champions League so another victory will take them to 20. And if it's a big win like last season they will feel a little more comfortable wearing that World Club champions crest on their shirts. The one that seems to have cursed them since the turn of the year.","Real Madrid were in scintillating form before going into the winter break .

"He was given four years of free tuition after both of his parents died by his freshman year. Now, 35 years later, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald has given Haverford College $25million back. Howard Lutnick, who lost 658 employees at the financial firm, including his younger brother, Gary, in the 9/11 terror attacks, made the generous contribution to the college in Pennsylvania on Saturday. Handing over a check to president Daniel Weiss, the 53-year-old said: 'Haverford was there for me and taught me what it meant to be a human being.' Returning the favor: Howard Lutnick (pictured), 53, was given four years of free tuition after both of his parents died by his freshman year. Now, 35 years later, he has given Haverford College $25million back . College: Mr Lutnick, CEO and chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald, made the generous contribution to the college (pictured) in Pennsylvania on Saturday. He said: 'Haverford taught me what it meant to be a human being' In response, Mr Weiss said the contribution, which is the largest single gift in the highly selective college's 181-year history, will be partly used to pay for much-needed library renovations. 'It's transformational, an overused word for sure, but not here,' said Mr Weiss, who presides over 1,200 students at the college, which prides itself on its Quaker heritage. Lutnick, who has been CEO of the New York City company since 1991 and chairman since 1996, was a senior in high school in Jericho when his 42-year-old artist mother, Jane, died of cancer (lymphoma). The following year, during his first week at Haverford, his father, Solomon, who taught at Queens College, passed away in hospital while being treated for colon and lung cancer. Generous: Haverford College president Daniel Weiss (right) said the contribution will be partly used to pay for much-needed library renovations. Left, Lutnick is pictured with his wife, Allison; they have four children . Paying tribute: On September 11, 2001, Lutnick (pictured at the 9/11 memorial) lost 658 employees at the financial firm in the  terror attacks. The firm was based in the World Trade Center's North Tower . A nurse treating the history professor had given him 100 times the dose of chemotherapy drugs that he was supposed to receive. The tragic mistake in 1979 left Lutnick and his brother orphaned. A week later, then-president of Haverford, Robert Stevens, called Lutnick and offered him a full scholarship for his degree in economics. 'Howard, your four years here are free', he told him. Lutnick, whose extended family had largely abandoned him, his brother and sister Edie, gratefully accepted the gift and went on to graduate in 1983, before joining Cantor Fitzgerald the same year. Speaking of the full scholarship, the businessman told The Philadelphia Inquirer: 'Since I had only been at the school for a week, they couldn't possibly have known about me. Tragic: Lutnick's younger brother, Gary (pictured), passed away during the 9/11 terror attacks in New York . One of the attacks: Lutnick would have also died but he was taking his son to his first day of kindergarten . 'It was more about who they are as an institution than it was about me.' On September 11, 2001, Lutnick would have died with the rest of his employees in the World Trade Center's North Tower, but he was taking his son, Kyle, to his first day of kindergarten. Despite the majority of the company's 960 New York employees having perished, Lutnick made a risky decision - Cantor Fitzgerald would survive. In subsequent years, he rebuilt the firm into a global business with 8,000 employees, while giving 25 per cent of its profits - around $180million in total - to the families of 9/11 victims for five years. Siblings: Lutnick's extended family  largely abandoned him, his brother and sister Edie, following their parents' deaths. Above, Lutnich and his sister are pictured at Cantor Fitzgerald's annual charity day in 2013 . Lutnick, whose net worth is now an estimated $45million, and his employees continue to forgo a day's pay on September 11 each year and the company donates a day's revenue to charities. Over the past 25 years, Lutnick, who is the chairman of Haverford's board of managers and lives in New York City with his wife Allison and four children, has donated $65million to the school. The money has been used to build an indoor tennis and track center bearing his brother's name and an integrated athletic center in the name of his former best friend, Douglas Gardner, also a Cantor Fitzgerald employee who perished in the World Trade Center attacks. The funds - in particular, Saturday's record gift of $25million - have contributed greatly to the college's capital campaign, which aims to raise $225million by 2017.","Howard Lutnick was in high school when mother, Jane, died of cancer .

"Former England manager Fabio Capello used a word associated with homophobic abuse in a radio interview in which he also defended racist comments made by Arrigo Sacchi. Capello had been asked if he thought criticism of current La Liga champions Atletico Madrid for an over-physical approach was justified and he replied: 'I don't agree that they are violent. Football is not for mariquitas.' The Spanish word mariquitas is the diminutive of marica which is an offensive terms used against gay people. Capello could argue in this context a closer translation would be 'football is not for fairies' but many took to social media to condemn the comments made on Spain's Onda Cero radio station. Fabio Capello has come under fire after using the derogative term for gay people during his radio interview . In the same interview Capello defended Sacchi over comments from the former Italy boss earlier this week. Sacchi had said toTuttosport: 'Italy has too many foreign players. Look at the Viareggio tournament, I would say there are too many black players.' He later claimed his record as a coach demonstrated he was not a racist. 'What he said is not racism,' said Capello. 'We just need to have more Italian players in our youth academies, [players] with an Italian identity. We also have black players who are Italian but he was referring to the youth teams that have eight or nine foreign players in them.' Capello's comments include him talking about Spanish dictator Francisco Franco in a good light . Capello is no stranger to controversy. In 2006 after his first spell as Real Madrid coach he returned to Italy telling newspaper La Repubblica that he missed the combination of: 'Latin creativity and the rigorous order that Franco left behind' in Spain. The comments horrified those who had suffered under the dictator during his 36-year-reign. Capello was paid £6million a year by the Football Association as England manager but was sacked after four unproductive years. He is currently Russia's head coach but his time in charge has been marred by appalling results and problems over unpaid wages.

"Luis Suarez helped move Barcelona to within one point of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga, scoring in an emphatic win over Athletic Bilbao. He was given the ‘butcher of Bilbao’ treatment by Xabier Etxeita whose first half kick on him went unpunished but who repeated the crime in the second half and was shown the straight red. But despite being left with stud marks above his right knee Suarez finished the night with a smile on his face and his team-mates had plenty to celebrate after one of their best performances of the season meant they took three points from what is a notoriously difficult fixture.

'We got the goals early' said Suarez, 'but they kept fighting and we had to match them in intensity to win the game.' The former Liverpool striker linked up with Neymar and Leo Messi to score the second after Messi had scored the first from a free-kick. Athletic made a fight of it in the second half with goals from Mikel Rico and Artiz Aduriz but Barcelona’s front three have clicked into gear just as Real Madrid’s trident have stalled and with Neymar getting on the scoresheet and Oscar De Marcos putting through his own net under pressure from Messi the game was won. Pedro replaced the wounded Suarez late-on and got the fifth. Athletic started with all the belief that Atletico Madrid had shown 24 hours earlier in their win over Real Madrid. They were physical too with Xabier Etxeita going through the back of Luis Suarez. But with another foul on the edge of the area Messi was given his first chance to test the home side’s keeper on 16 minutes and he took it with a free-kick that deflected past Gorka Iraizoz when it hit Aymeric Laporte in the wall.

Former Liverpool striker Suarez kisses his fingers, as is customary in his celebration after scoring . Neymar, fast becoming the face of Barcelona, fights to take the ball past Oscar de Marcos during the match . It was the sixth straight game that Messi had scored and it took him to 23 goals for the season, just five goals short of the earlier pace setter Cristiano Ronaldo who has 28. On 20 minutes Neymar flicked Messi into space and he crossed for Suarez to rise at the far post and send his header back across the face of the goal. It looked a goal all the way but Iraizoz dived to his right to save to prolong the Suarez drought, but only for another six minutes. His next chance came on 26 minutes and this time Iraizoz could do nothing to prevent the goal. Neymar found Suarez who fed Messi and when he received the ball back from the Argentine, he found the bottom corner with a brilliant first time strike.

Suarez's shot ricochets back off Aymeric Laporte's leg as Barcelona looked to break down the Bilbao defence . It wasn’t all Barcelona. Former Real Sociedad keeper Claudio Bravo saved at the back post from Aritz Aduriz who then hit the post with a header. Barça could also have scored again when Xavi crossed and first Neymar and then Suarez failed to convert. Barcelona were flying forward but quick in defence too with Jeremy Mathieu back in the team ahead of Javier Mascherano and getting in ahead of Aduriz to prevent Athletic getting a foothold back in the game. Neymar was then fed by Messi but Laporte came across to make the interception. Alves chopped down Muniain and was shown the yellow card that rules him out of next game.

Suarez could have doubled his tally at the start of the second half when he received another pass from Messi and turned to get his shot away only for Laporte to block. The French Basque was showing why Manchester United were interested in him in January. Athletic were not out of the game and when Messi gave the ball away in midfield they raced away to pull a goal back. It was Aduriz who got the shot away and when Bravo could only parry it and Mikel Rico swept in the rebound. Messi took two minutes to put things right. Suarez was this time the provider crossing from the right for Messi to connect at the far post. His effort hit Oscar de Marcos as it crossed the line.

Neymar scored the fourth from Messi’s assist and it looked as if Barcelona would be able to coast the last 25 mintues but Aduriz beat Bravo from Muniain’s pass to make it 4-2. The old war-horse – one of Spain’s under-rated players and now 33 – had his 100th La Liga goal and he was keeping the home side in the game but only just. After Etxeita had been sent off for kicking Suarez under the referee’s Mateu Lahoz’ nose Barça could breathe more easily. Pedro came on to replace the Uruguayan and from a mesmerizing Messi assist Sergio Busquets crossed for the substitute to make it five. Barcelona have found another gear in 2015. Ever since their talisman took on the coach at the start of the year, elections were called, and the Sporting Director was sacked the team hasn’t looked back. They are now right on Real Madrid’s shoulder and Suarez is finding his range.","Barcelona had the opportunity to close the gap on Real Madrid after Carlo Ancelotti's men lost the Madrid derby on Saturday .

"Some pupils are naturally brighter than others, a study of twins suggests. The research shows inherited intelligence accounts for almost two thirds of marks in GCSEs, while the amount of work done in class accounts for the rest. This suggests raising the standard of teaching in schools may have a  limited impact on children’s academic achievement when compared with the genes they are born with. Or, put more simply, nature trumps nurture. Kings College London research found inherited intelligence could account for nearly 60 per cent of a teenager's GCSE results, while quality of teaching only influences results by a third. The study was based upon long-term analysis of twins who sat the standard school exams at the age of 16 . Professor Robert Plomin, who based the . study on the exam results of thousands of children, said genetics had . been overlooked because of concerns about ‘labelling’ children. But he said his findings could spell . the end of the generalised approach to schooling in favour of a system . tailored to individual ability. Genetic scanning could flag up . children’s strengths and weaknesses early on in their school career, . enabling teachers to identify how best to help them. ‘Kids label each . other already. They know who’s sporty, who’s bright,’ he told The . Spectator. ‘If we can read a kid’s genome we can . predict and prevent disease. If we can read their DNA, we can tailor the . teaching to help a kid with learning difficulties. Surely it’s worse to . just sit in a classroom and sink, unable to read because no one has . identified that you might have trouble.’ Professor Plomin, of the Institute of . Psychiatry at King’s College London, runs the Twins Early Development . Study, which follows all twins  born in England and Wales from 1994 to . 1996. Analysis of the GCSE results of more . than 11,100 of them suggested genetic background had a ‘substantial’ impact on their results. In science it accounted for 58 per cent of . scores, in maths for 55 per cent and English 52 per cent. IQ scores have been linked with genes . before and Professor Plomin said the advantage increased with age. ‘Little genetic differences become bigger and bigger as you go through . life,’ he said. ‘Bright kids read more, they hang out with kids who read . more.’ Professor Plomin thinks genetic scanning could eventually be used to identity particularly gifted children or those with academic weaknesses. By reading a child's genome (pictured), adults can predict and therefore influence a child's academic progression, as well as prevent disease . Prof Plomin believes education professionals have been too fast to dismiss the influence of genetics and intelligence on children's academic potential. But he thinks his research can be used in a positive way to develop education tailored to a child's unique needs, that will translate into better exam results . Professor Plomin, an American . geneticist, has been asked to present his findings to ministers and . officials at the Department for Education. A DfE insider said: ‘As we learn more . from science, a decentralised school system with great teachers . providing personalised learning will be even more important.’ ‘Twin tests’ usually involve . comparisons between identical and non-identical twins – or those brought . up apart in different environments. n GIRLS who walk to school do better in class, according to research. A study found that children who go by . foot outperform peers who travel by bus or car. The difference is put . down to exercise, with girls gaining more from the effort of walking. Exercise has been shown to help the brain grow and boost memory. The study of 1,700 Spanish teenagers was published in Archives of Paediatrics & Adolescent Medicine.","An American scientist at Kings College London found inherited .

"They created some of the world’s most loved masterpieces and melodies, as well as works of literature and scientific theories. But what did the likes of Pablo Picasso and Charles Dickens do in their spare time and when did they create their masterpieces? Now an infographic reveals the hobbies, day jobs and dining preferences of some of prolific inventors, thinkers, writers, artists and composers, showing the great minds don’t always think alike. (View full-size. via Podio). Click on the chart above to find out what the different coloured blocks mean and reveal little details about the famous thinkers' lives . The chart, created by Florida-based online work platform Podio, is based on diary entries, letters and documents revealing the little details of people's lives. It reveals that writers Honore de Balzac, Charles Dickens, Kingsley Amis and Franz Kafka all took regular naps, with Kafta - who is best known for The Metamorphosis - typically spending between 3pm and 7pm catching up on sleep, as he tended to work during the night. The chart explains: 'Resting the mind helps generate novel ideas. At least 12 hours away from work is recommended, preferably involving some sleep. 'Naps can also boost the mind’s ability to solve creative problems.’ Literary eating habits: Charles Dickens (illustrated left) spent a long time eating . dinner, while Kingsley Amis (pictured right in 1986) drank scotch and William Styron spent from . 8pm to midnight drinking and smoking . There IS a link between creative genius and madness - with both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder frequent in highly creative and intelligent people. The idea was investigated by a panel of scientists who had all have some form of mental disorder. Kay Redfield Jamison of John Hopkins school of Medicine, who suffers from bipolar disorder, said that intelligence tests on Swedish 16-year-olds had shown that highly intelligent children were most likely to go on to develop the disorder. 'They found that people who excelled when they were 16 years old were four times as likely to go on to develop bipolar disorder,' says Jamison. Painter Van Gogh and author Jack Kerouac were both hailed as geniuses but displayed self-destructive behaviour. What's less clear is why human beings might have evolved this trait. 'The notion of a ‘tortured genius’ or ‘mad scientist’ may be more than a romantic aberration,' according to experts at the World Science Fair. 'Research shows that bipolar disorder and schizophrenia correlate with high creativity and intelligence, raising tantalizing questions: What role does environment play in the path to mental illness? Previous research has hinted that much of the 'link' is created by one particular gene, known as DARPP-32, which links genius with madness. Three quarters of people inherit a version of the DARPP-32 gene, which enhances the brain's ability to think by improving information processing by the prefrontal cortex - the part of the brain that orchestrates thoughts and actions. Contemporary author Haruki Murakami goes swimming - an activity he shares with fellow novelist Kurt Vonnegut on the chart, whereas Victor Hugo - author of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Les Miserables - preferred to take rather less comfortable ice baths. Charles Dickens spent a long time eating dinner, while Kingsley Amis drank scotch and William Styron spent from 8pm to midnight drinking and smoking. The chart reveals that Ludwig van Beethoven was very particular about his coffee, insisting that exactly 60 beans were put in a cup, while Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky preferred tea as well as reading the Bible and philosophy books. Out of the four composers on the chart, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is the only one who did not regularly go for long walks for inspiration. Perhaps this was because he spent around four hours a day giving music lessons to earn money. He is not the only famous creative mind to have a day job to fund his creative ventures. German Philosopher Immanuel Kant lectured at a university, Kurt Vonnegut taught at a school, Sigmund Freud typically spent four hours a day treating patients and Franz Kafka worked at the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute. The chart . also reveals the strange quirks that helped great thinkers to work. Balzac wore a 'monkish robe and Moroccan slippers' while Maya Angelou . worked in an anonymous hotel room and Dickens insisted on silence to pen . his prose. Mozart, Freud, Kafka, Picasso and Gustave Flaubert, the author of Madame Bovary, all worked into the early hours of the morning. Music makers: The chart reveals that Ludwig van . Beethoven (pictured left) was very particular about his coffee, insisting that exactly . 60 beans were put in a cup, while Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky preferred tea. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (pictured right) is the only composer listed who did not go for regular walks . The chart says: 'The brain functions differently at various times of the day. Studies show that early risers tend to be good at making plans, while those who work late into the night enjoy more divergent thinking.' When it comes to favourite meals, Immanuel Kant ate a pub meal of meat and wine for lunch, as did Kingsley Amis who always had a coffee after his meal. However, the author of Lucky Jim did have a healthy breakfast, consisting of grapefruit, a banana and cereal. Composer Richard Straus ate a breakfast of three eggs, tea and jam, while Flaubert also ate eggs, vegetables, cheese or fruit - as well as a cup of cold chocolate. Mozart, Freud (pictured left), Kafka, Picasso (pictured right) and Gustave Flaubert, the author of Madame Bovary, all worked into the early hours of the morning, with Kafta taking long naps in the afternoon for compensating working late .","Infographic reveals the hobbies, day .

Barcelona’s then sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta was sacked in January in part for his failure to sort the club’s central defensive shortage. He signed the Belgium international despite his terrible luck with injuries in the previous two years and the fact that he arrived injured after he suffered problems with his right hamstring during the World Cup. On the day of his presentation Zubizarreta said the player was ready to perform immediately and that he had no concerns over his fitness but despite playing in a friendly alongside Luis Suarez against the Indonesia Under 19 team in September, he broke down again in November. Even when the club decided he would need surgery they maintained that the player could make it back before the end of the season. The latest setback puts that return date in doubt.","Thomas Vermaelen joined Barcelona for £15m from Arsenal last summer .

"Harvard University students who were unable to sit their exams this morning following a bomb threat do not have to take the tests, officials have said. The canceled exams mean that, if a student claimed there were explosives in order to get out of the Ivy League college's tough tests, then he or she may very well have been granted their wish. Four buildings at the Cambridge, Massachusetts university were evacuated just around 9am after campus police received an email claiming explosives had been planted inside. But just two hours - and following preliminary sweeps by local police, bomb squads and the FBI - police sources suggested that the threat was a hoax. It coincides with exam time at the university. Threat: SWAT team officers arrive at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts on Monday morning after four campus buildings were evacuated following bomb threats . Blocked off: Police block off the entrance to the Science Center, one of the targeted buildings . On Monday afternoon, school officials told the campus newspaper, The Harvard Crimson, that students would be allowed to use the grades from previous work in a course as their final grade. Alternatively, . they can opt to get a pass or fail grade for the class; the . university allows all students to complete a certain number of . 'Pass/Fail' classes during their degree. Some . exams have been rescheduled for 6.30pm this evening or for next semester - but officials told the Crimson that students could opt to . take the exam or the other grading options above. The announcement sparked anger and debate online, with many saying that the exams should be rescheduled for everyone. 'Assuming . the purpose of hoax was to cancel finals, wouldn't canceling finals . reward said behavior?' one Twitter user asked, while another agreed: . 'Doesn't set a good precedent.' In . addition, John L. Ellison, the Associate Dean of College and . Administrative Board Secretary, said if students did not feel well . enough prepared for 2pm exams, they could also choose not to sit them. Escape: Students are pictured gathering in Annenburg Hall as they awaited updates on Monday . Secured: After a sweep of the buildings, including the Science Center, no explosives were found . Search: A police officer secures an area at Harvard on Monday after the threat was emailed to authorities . 'If for any reason a student does not feel able to take an exam - including anxiety, loss of study time, lack of access to material and belongings left in one of the affected buildings, or travel schedule - he or she should be in touch immediately with his or her resident dean,' Ellison said. It was a fraught day for universities in Boston, which is still reeling from the bombings at the marathon eight months ago. The FBI, police departments and bomb-sniffing dogs had descended on Harvard after the school received the bomb threats by email around 9am. An hour later, the University of . Massachusetts in Boston sent out an alert over Twitter telling students . to evacuate the McCormack Building because of a suspected gunman. 'Possible person with a firearm,' it read. 'Avoid area. Officials are on scene.' Update: Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris addresses students in Annenberg Hall . Hunt: A state police officer responds to reports of explosives with a bomb-sniffing dog this morning . Patrol: Firefighters stand outside another of the buildings, Sever Hall, where humanities classes are taught . Moments later, state police tweeted: . 'There were reports of a threat at @UmassBoston. There is no threat. False report. Scene is clear.' Students at Harvard had been issued an emergency alert shortly after 9am, instructing them to leave the Science . Center and three other buildings - Sever Hall, which contains . classrooms for the humanities, Emerson Hall, the philosophy building, . and Thayer Hall, a freshman dorm. But within two hours, CNN reported that . the Harvard University Campus Police had been given the 'all clear' and . that the incident was apparently a hoax. All four of the buildings have now . been reopened. Harvard said that a search for explosive devices was being conducted but that none had been found. Probe: The threats were phoned in on Monday as final exams were underway at the Ivy League school . Back to the books: Students outside a building at Harvard University as evacuations were underway . Precautions: State and local police responded to the reports and the buildings reopened hours later . Evacuations: Students gather in the Science Center Plaza at Harvard University on Monday after police received unconfirmed reports that explosives had been planted at four campus buildings . The campus newspaper, The Harvard Crimson, shared a photograph of students swarming the Science Center Plaza after the threats were reported. The paper also said that students have filled the study hall at Annenberg Hall after being evacuated. Tom Fuentes, a law enforcement analyst, told CNN the search . for explosives was likely to continue throughout the day due to the sheer size of . the buildings. The Science Center, for example, has 20 general-use classrooms . as well as five lecture halls, teaching laboratores for the sciences . and other resources. Ben Forman, an employee at the Harvard . Book Store near to the campus gates, said the atmosphere around the . college was not too panicked. Second threat: The University of Massachusetts in Boston (pictured) also reported a possible person with a firearm on campus on Monday - but this turned out to be a hoax . Sites: Explosives may have been placed at four properties indicated on this map: the Science Center, Thayer Hall, Sever Hall and Emerson Hall - one is a freshman dorm and two more are classrooms . Scene: Harvard (pictured) is less than three miles from the scene of the Boston bombings in April . 'It looks pretty relaxed out there actually,' he said. 'There is a gate closed into the yard, but its not panicked.' Three of the buildings border Harvard Yard and access to the Yard has been restricted to residents with Harvard IDs. The bomb threats come almost exactly eight months to the day that two explosives were detonated at the Boston Marathon finish line, killing three and injuring hundred more. The homemade bombs exploded less than three miles from Harvard's campus.","Police, the FBI and SWAT teams descended on Harvard University this morning after bomb threats at 4 buildings were emailed to authorities .

"His eyes light up when he talks of the time England threw him into the World Cup deep end as a raw fast bowler barely out of club cricket. ‘My first World Cup in South Africa stands out,’ said James Anderson, who stepped up from Burnley CC to the big time 12 years ago. ‘It was the first time my family had seen me play for England and it meant a lot for them to be there. ‘There was also the Zimbabwe situation where we were effectively knocked out because we didn’t go there.’ James Anderson hopes the upcoming World Cup isn't his last. Pictured by Sportsmail snapper Kevin Quigley . Anderson can go past England's Test wicket haul held by Sir Ian Botham (pictured above at Lord's) England refused to travel to Harare because of safety concerns and Zimbabwe were awarded all four World Cup points. Then a two-wicket defeat by Australia, when Andy Bichel hammered Anderson, made it impossible for England to progress. ‘It was an eventful time and, even though I felt I then lost us that game against Australia in Port Elizabeth, when Nasser Hussain put faith in me, the fact he brought me on at a critical time gave me confidence that I could perform at that level.’ Then there was his first World Cup as a fan. ‘Something we should look at as a team now is the 1992 World Cup because that was in Australia and New Zealand too. I was nine. We didn’t have Sky so I went round my dad’s mate’s house to watch it in the early hours. ‘I know it’s a while ago but people still talk about it as a great World Cup for England and we know we’ll get big support in Australia. It could be an exciting time and we can draw on the history of what happened then.’ England finished runners-up in 1992, losing to Imran Khan’s Pakistan in the Melbourne final. Ian Botham in action  during the 1992 Cricket World Cup. England reached the final of the tournament . But Botham and Co were beaten by Imran Khan (pictured) and his Pakistan team in the Melbourne showpiece . There is no doubting Anderson’s enthusiasm. The man who stands on the brink of his 100th Test and Sir Ian Botham’s wicket-taking record is fit, raring to go, and keen to point out that limited-overs matches mean just as much to him as the ultimate game. ‘One-day cricket is really significant for me,’ said Anderson as he prepares to go to Australia  for the triangular series that precedes the World Cup. ‘I made my England debut in one-day cricket and I’ve always enjoyed that form. I’ve still got a drive to play one-day cricket so until that stops I will carry on. My record in 50-over games is probably better than Tests if you look at the stats. It will be great to have these months of one-day cricket.’ But surely this is his last chance to make a real impact in a World Cup? The premier one-day tournament is usually a watershed. Alastair Cook has gone and it looks certain England will rip up their one-day blueprint and start again after this World Cup with younger, more dynamic players. Anderson appeals in England's Super Eights clash against Sri Lanka during the 2007 Cricket World Cup . The England bowler dives for the ball during England's 2011 campaign - he was jaded after his Ashes heroics . Anderson jumps for joy after dismissing Sir Lanka's Tillakaratne Dilshan at Old Trafford in May . ‘I don’t want to say this is my last World Cup,’ Anderson insisted. ‘It’s probably unlikely I’ll play in the next one because I’ll be 36 by then but it’s not impossible. I want to concentrate on this one first.’ England will need him at his best. As Nasser Hussain identified in these pages after the series defeat in Sri Lanka, England’s bowling is an even bigger one-day problem than the batting, which is often too cautious. Anderson, who sat out Sri Lanka to provide rest for his battle-scarred body, and Stuart Broad, who returns after knee surgery, are crucial figures if England are to take World Cup wickets and restrict the big hitters. ‘We’ve identified the last 15 overs of innings as an area where we can get better,’ said Anderson. ‘I see myself bowling in that stage of a game and it’s something we’ll look at. I don’t necessarily think it needs new skills and at this stage of my career I’ve got enough up my sleeve to perform well. It’s partly execution of each delivery and you’ve got to be able to hit the right area with every ball. ‘You have to pick the right moment to bowl the right ball and stay one step ahead of the batter. With only four men outside the circle it’s crucial we get our fields right. You see people sometimes changing every ball but you have to be clinical. You have to have options rather than trying to sort it out on the field.’ England will be rank outsiders in the triangular series against Australia and India and then the World Cup. ‘Everywhere you look people have been saying we haven’t got a chance but, not only does that make you more determined, it means you can pass under the radar,’ said Anderson. Anderson is pictured celebrating Michael Clarke's wicket in the first Ashes Test back in 2013 . 2003: Produces an inspired four-wicket burst to skittle Pakistan in Cape Town, but is then smashed out of the ground by Andy Bichel in Port Elizabeth as Australia pip England in a nerve-shredder. 2007: Put to the sword by South Africa’s Graeme Smith and A B de Villiers as England limp out at the Super Eights stage in the West Indies. 2011: Produces some brilliant bowling as England beat South Africa, but is shattered after his Ashes heroics Down Under and isn’t in the team as England are hammered by Sri Lanka in the quarter-final. They will attempt to exceed expectations under new leadership after Anderson’s friend Cook was replaced by Eoin Morgan. ‘I feel sorry for Cooky because he’s done so much behind the scenes and he’s got a real vision of where he wants the team to go,’ said Anderson. ‘But his form in the last 12 to 18 months hasn’t been near the standard it needs to be to stay in and he will admit that.’ Whatever happens in the World Cup, Anderson has a big date in Antigua in April, where he is due to appear in his 100th Test and can celebrate it with the four wickets he needs to exceed Botham’s tally of 383. ‘I’m not thinking about the record,’ he said. ‘One-day cricket is at the forefront of my mind. The last thing I want to be thinking is that I could get those wickets in my 100th Test in Antigua. I could get injured. I’d love to pass the record but I don’t want to tempt fate.’ And, however long Anderson has left in both Test and one-day cricket, he will not be changing the aggressive style that landed him in hot water last summer for a clash with Ravindra Jadeja at Trent Bridge. The bowler was cleared on the Level Three disciplinary charge that could have seen him banned but his penchant for sledging, which contrasts with his mild-mannered off-field demeanour, remains under scrutiny. Anderson  will not be changing the aggressive style that landed him in hot water last summer for a clash with Ravindra Jadeja at Trent Bridge (pictured) ‘My attitude is something I’ve worked on with a psychologist over the last few years to get the best out of me as a bowler and that means being aggressive,’ said Anderson. ‘The umpires are on the field to marshal what’s going on and if they feel someone oversteps the mark they report it to the match referee. Nothing was reported in that game or the series. But it is something I’m conscious of. ‘We know there are kids watching and we have to try to find a balance between winning and being a role model. I’m well aware of it but I think the aggression is something I’ve channelled well in recent years. My career took off in 2008 and that was the start of getting it right and being consistent on the field.It’s always been part of the game. ‘As a kid playing club cricket I would be sledged by 40-year-old blokes. I saw it growing up on TV — the Aussies doing it to England. I never want to cross the line where it goes too far. I’ll continue to be aggressive but I’m very aware of the laws and spirit of the game. That aggression has helped me take wickets and I’ll try to keep channelling it in the right way.’ It is a method that has served England well and will need to do so again if they are to have any chance of upsetting the odds in Australia.

"Of all the weird and wonderful events of the 1960s, few are as strange as an animal experiment that took place on the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1965. For ten weeks, in a charming villa on the island of St Thomas, overlooking the  Caribbean, Dr John C. Lilly, a neurologist, tried to teach a six-year-old dolphin to speak English. His 23-year-old assistant, Margaret Howe, a Virgin Islands local, would live, day and night, with Peter, a bottlenose dolphin. And they would eat, bathe, sleep and play together in complete isolation. Scroll down for video . Special bond: Margaret Howe and Peter the dolphin spent ten weeks together at a flooded villa at the  Communication Research Labs in St Thomas, US Virgin Islands in an attempt to get Peter to talk . What no one predicted is that Peter the dolphin would take it one step further. He didn’t get too far with his English, but he did fall in love — sexual and romantic love — with his teacher. And next week, after nearly five decades of silence from Margaret Howe, a BBC documentary will tell the whole story. By the time of the experiment, Dr Lilly had already written a 1961 bestseller, Man And Dolphin, claiming dolphins’ brains were 40 per cent bigger than ours and that, like us, dolphins trembled at pain and could control their anger. What’s more, he believed, they were capable of understanding human language. Extraordinarily, he was also licensed by the American government to investigate the effects of LSD, and chose to inject it into two of the dolphins in his care in the Caribbean, though he was disappointed to find it appeared to have no effect. The preparations for the Nasa-funded experiment into dolphins’ ability to ‘speak’ were extensive. First, Dr Lilly had the villa — Dolphin House — flooded with seawater, so that Margaret and Peter could live as one. Peter the dolphin learned a few words in English, including 'ball' and 'diamond', but eventually fell in love with Margaret . The water on the first floor was 22in deep, allowing Margaret to wade and Peter to swim. Margaret could climb out of the water to work at a desk suspended from the ceiling. At night, she lifted herself onto a hanging mattress, protected from Peter’s splashings by a shower curtain. She ate tinned food, so no need for any deliveries. No one was to interrupt their daily routine. And what a rigorous routine it was, from Sunday to Friday, with only Saturdays off for Margaret. She lived her life in a swimming costume — with an extra leotard on colder evenings — and cut her hair to a quarter of an inch long to make her interactions with Peter easier. The day began at 8am with Peter’s first English lesson. Margaret’s aim was to encourage him to mimic sounds which she taught him. They can make human-like sounds through their blowholes, and it was Dr Lilly’s aim to nurture that skill. Margaret came up with the idea of painting her face in white make-up and black lipstick so that he could clearly see the shape of her lips moving. Audio recordings of the experiment reveal how Howe encouraged Peter to greet her with the words ‘Hello Margaret’. As she told documentary maker Christopher Riley recently: ‘“M” was very difficult. I worked on the “M” sound and he eventually rolled over to bubble it through the water. That “M” he worked on so hard.’ In time, he could pronounce an approximation of the words ‘one’, ‘we’, ‘triangle’ and ‘hello’, and eventually, when Margaret parroted ‘work, work, work’, he would reply ‘play, play, play’. At 10am, Margaret and Peter would indeed play together in the pool. There were further lessons at 12pm and 3pm, with five pounds of fish at each session. In between, Margaret continued to play with Peter, inside the villa and in an outside tank, throwing balls and towels for the dolphin to fetch. Peter was also a keen TV-watcher and would stare at a set she turned on at the side of the pool. During breaks, Margaret wrote her notes, prepared meals and did the housework. To begin with, all went well, and Peter began to make progress with developing human-like sounds. ‘Peter is his energetic self and a bit nippy on the toes,’ she wrote in her diary, referring to the little nibbles Peter made. ‘I carry a long-handled broom with me for that and ward him off. This is not always the case: we have had several long “loving” sessions. The water is deep enough for him to roll over and this he does for tummy rubs. He sleeps just next to my bed. ‘Some nights he has been quiet and others he just has to yell and splash around. He is always hungry and usually wakes me early in the morning to tell me to feed him.’ Peter was becoming a touch naughty, . too. Initially, he listened attentively as Margaret went through lessons . devoted to counting and shapes. But, like a lot of unruly . six-year-olds, he preferred to talk rather than listen. ‘He seems to . have lost his sense of conversation,’ Howe wrote: ‘He often overrides . me. I cannot teach him if he is going to yell every time I open my . mouth. He has said, for the [recording] tape, one clear word, “ball”.’ Peter . also spent a good deal of time staring at himself in a mirror. And, . when Margaret answered the telephone, Peter got annoyed,  making loud . and competitive noises as she talked into the receiver. Telling tales: Margaret has spoken of her experience in the villa with Peter for the first time in decades . Could Peter have been a little jealous? Certainly, he was getting close to her. By the second week, she wrote, Peter had grown much ‘more sociable, physical, making a thorough study of my feet, legs, ankles, knees. Doing this, he is very gentle, the rough part being when he tries to push me around’. Peter was growing keener and keener on winning her attentions, hurling a ball against her shower curtain to get her to play. Increasingly, he only wanted to play ball with her and not on his own. And then, in the fourth week, an alarming development occurred. As Margaret confided to her diary: ‘Peter has become sexually aroused several times during the week. ‘I find that his desires are hindering our relationship,’ she wrote. ‘He jams himself again and again against my legs, circles around me, is inclined to nibble and is generally so excited that he cannot  control his attitude toward me.’ According to Andy Williamson, the vet who looked after the animals’ health at Dolphin House: ‘Dolphins get sexual urges. I’m sure Peter had plenty of thoughts along those lines.’ Now in a panic, Margaret returned Peter to a tank with two other  dolphins, Sissy and Pam, to restrain him, and the period of exile seems to have worked because, on his return, Peter suddenly became gentle, sliding his mouth over  her shin. Peter, Margaret decided, ‘is  courting me or something very similar. He presents his tummy and genital area for stroking. Perhaps this is his way of involving me in some form of sex play without  scaring me away.’ As she tells Christopher Riley: ‘That relationship of having to be together sort of turned into really enjoying being together, and wanting to be together, and missing him when he wasn’t there. ‘I did have a very close encounter with — I can’t even say a dolphin again — Peter.’ The problem was that, just at the time Peter and Margaret had begun to hammer out a workable relationship, the experiment ended and the lab was closed. Without funding, the fate of the dolphins was in question. They were shipped to Lilly’s other lab, in a disused bank building in Miami, Florida. It was a far cry from the relative freedom and comfortable surroundings of Dolphin House. In Miami, Peter quickly deteriorated, and after a few weeks  Margaret received the shocking news that Peter had committed suicide by refusing to breathe, and sinking to the bottom of his tank. Was it the change in his surroundings, or could it have been that he was pining for the human he had grown so close to? Vet Andy Williamson puts Peter’s death down to a broken heart, brought on by a separation from Margaret that he didn’t understand: ‘Margaret could rationalise it, but when she left, could Peter? Here’s the love of his life gone.’ Dolphins may not speak English — but, just like humans, they know all about broken hearts. After the experiment with Peter ended, Margaret Howe left the laboratory and married the project’s photographer, John Lovatt. Dr Lilly, although mocked by much of the scientific establishment, continued his researches into communication between humans and dolphins into the Eighties (he died in 2001). He investigated other ways to talk to them, even attempting to use telepathy. But after the extraordinary events in that sun-drenched laboratory in the Virgin Islands, no one ever tried to teach dolphins to speak English again. The Girl Who Talked To Dolphins is on BBC4 on June 17 at 9pm.","Margaret Howe lived with a dolphin for ten weeks in the 60s .
The aim was for her to teach Peter, a bottlenose, to speak English .
He learned a few words, but mainly, Peter fell in love with her ."
"Real Madrid will continue to monitor the progress of Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane despite the 21-year-old just having signed a new contract that ties him to the club until 2020. The European Cup holders know Kane's new five-year deal, coupled with the difficulty they have had in the past negotiating with Daniel Levy, would make him a very difficult to get inside the next two years. But they also see Tottenham as a selling club having already taken Luka Modric and Gareth Bale from them and so they will continue to watch the development of the England Under 21 striker who is likely to move up to Roy Hodgson's senior squad next month. Tottenham's Harry Kane heads the ball to score his side's winning goal against Arsenal . Kane celebrates in front of the Tottenham fans during the north London derby victory over Arsenal . Kane is swamped by his Tottenham team-mates as they won the north London derby over rivals Arsenal . Kane lets rip a roar after scoring the winning goal during the 2-1 victory over fierce rivals Arsenal . 2009-NOW: Tottenham (31 lg apps, 15 gls) 2011-2011: Leyton Orient (loan) (18, 5) 2012-2012: Millwall (loan) (22, 7) 2012-2013: Norwich City (loan) (3, 0) 2013-2013: Leicester City (loan) (13, 2) 2010-2010: England U17 (3, 2) 2010-2012: England U19 (14, 6) 2013-2013: England U20 (3, 1) 2013-NOW: England U21 (10, 8) Kane is already big news in Madrid because of the way he has kept Spain international and former Real striker Roberto Soldadao out of the team. Representatives of the club's scouting network have watched him several times this season, including on New Year's day when he got the first and the fourth in Spurs' 5-3 win over Chelsea. His performance at the weekend has only toughened their resolve to be part of any future race to sign him. On the same day that Kane was single-handedly deciding the north London derby, Real were losing the Madrid derby and their famed front three of Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo were failing to muster a single shot on target. On Monday, Madrid's Diario AS's front page headline read 'The BBC under suspicion' with a lack of intensity leveled at Bale, Benzema and Cristiano.

Tottenham striker Kane has even been likened to Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski in Spain . With Benzema and Ronaldo, 27 and 30 respectively, and Real with only Jese Rodriguez coming through, the club are likely to sign a new forward this summer. That is likely to be too early for any move for Kane but the Tottenham forward is now firmly on their list of future targets. In Spain, the Tottenham centre-forward has even been likened to Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski who Real Madrid tried and failed to sign at the start of last season. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino, however, believes it will be hard for any club to turn Kane's head away from White Hart Lane. He told Catalan broadcaster RAC1 last week: 'He has just signed a new deal and there are no buy-out clauses in England so whatever any club offers they will have to negotiate with the club. The player was born here, he came through [the youth system] here and he wants to spend his career playing for this club.'

"Star Date 24102012: We have detected evidence of a working tractor beam. Two physicists working at New York university have developed a technique for using beams of light to draw a particle toward a source and claim to have demonstrated it experimentally. Professor David Grier and David Ruffner, a graduate student, working at the Department of Physics and Centre for Soft Matter Research say they have realised the Star Trek-style technology - only on a miniscule scale. Scroll down for video . Science fiction technology: The crew of the star ship Enterprise often used their tractor beam to help friendly ships in distress and capture enemy vessels . Whenever a friendly star ship was in distress, it was no problem for the crew of the Enterprise to activate their tractor beam and drag the vessel to safety. However, until now the technology has remained beyond the reach of real-world physicists, with the best they could manage being laser-based tweezers that can drag particles across microscopic distances in two dimensions. Now in a paper published in the journal Physical Review Letters - and available in full here - Professor Grier and Mr Ruffner describe a technology that goes one better, by actually pulling particles towards their beam's source. It is well known that light can push objects - a property that forms the basis for the idea of using solar sails - but getting light to drag something has so far proved to be more difficult. The NYU tractor beam is based on Chinese research published last year into a kind of laser called a Bessel beam, which emits light in concentric rings. That study calculated that a such a beam could be designed to make a particle inside it emit photons on the side facing away from the beam's source, forcing the particle to recoil towards that source. No-one has as yet been able to make such a beam, but the NYU researchers got around the problem by instead projecting two Bessel beams side by side down a microscope and using a lens to angle them so they overlap. By varying the relative phase of the two beams, this technique traps the particle in a moving hologram they call an 'optical conveyor' which allows 'bi-directional transport in three dimensions'. New Scientist explains how projecting the beams in this way creates a pattern of alternating bright and dark regions. By fine tuning the beam photons in the bright regions which flow past the chosen particle can be made to scatter backwards, hitting the particle and knocking it on towards the next bright region. However, the beam is not quite ready to snare a starship. Professor Grier and Mr Ruffner demonstrated their technology by moving microscopic spheres of silica suspended in water over distances of 30 micrometres. 'This is still very much in its infancy,' Mr Ruffner told New Scientist. Nevertheless it opens the door to transforming science fiction into science fact - and Nasa has already been in touch.","Researchers have so far managed to move microscopic spheres of silica suspended in water over distances of 30 micrometres .

"New Zealand head coach Steve Hansen dismissed suggestions that he is taking Scotland lightly by selecting virtually a second-string side for the BT Murrayfield clash. The All Blacks boss has made 13 changes to the team who defeated England 24-21 at Twickenham last weekend, with captain Richie McCaw retained but wearing the No 6 jersey for the first time in what will be his 137th match for his country. Hansen surprised many with his selection despite the return of superstar stand-off Dan Carter, who is making his first international start in a year following injury. All Blacks coach Steven Hansen (left) chats with Richie McCaw ahead of Saturday's game at Murrayfield . ‘We’re taking Scotland very seriously,’ insisted the Kiwi coach. ‘We’ve already said that it’s a loseable game if we don’t prepare well and get our feet on the floor really quickly after last week. ‘We have a lot of respect for Scotland rugby but we’ve got our own plans and our own agenda that we’ve got to live by. I think people are totally misreading the situation if they think we are not respecting them. ‘We know they always bring a really physical game to the park but what we’ve seen of late is that they are trying to change their game, trying to play a fast game. And when teams do that and are successful at it, they score points.’ Scotland coach Vern Cotter is expecting a ferocious New Zealand challenge despite their personnel changes . Asked why he thought New Zealand had dominated the fixture, with 27 wins and two draws in 29 previous meetings going back more than 100 years, he said: ‘I’m not sure why they haven’t managed it. A lot of it might be self-belief. ‘Success breeds success and the opposite can be said about losing. ‘What I do know is that if we leave them in the competition for a large part of the game, then they will grow another arm and leg and become really dangerous. So we have to start well and put points on the board.’ Hansen does not fear any insight his fellow Kiwi coach Vern Cotter might bring to the Scotland camp, however. All Blacks fly half Dan Carter fires out a pass during a training drill at Peffermill in Edinburgh . ‘Well, he has never coached the All Blacks and he has been out of the country for eight years,’ he said. ‘So I’m not sure how much insight he has really got.’ Cotter, for his part, also insisted that the tourists were not being disrespectful with their team selection — and that they were determined to maintain their undefeated run against the Scots. ‘Even during the Commonwealth Games Sevens tournament in Glasgow, the New Zealand players were overhead talking amongst themselves how they did not want to be the first team to lose to Scotland at any level, be it Under-20, Sevens and certainly not at All Blacks level,’ said the Scotland boss. ‘That is why they are comfortable with the team they have selected to play us. Their coaching staff know those players will give it absolutely everything and they will be all the more dangerous for it.’ Cotter added that he did not think the changes — with the likes of 2011 World Cup winners Israel Dagg, Sam Whitelock and Kieran Read being left out of the squad completely — would disrupt the All Blacks. ‘What they do is their business,’ he said. ‘These players who take us on, you may say, have less experience but will not be lesser players for New Zealand. ‘We are anticipating a very enthusiastic and dangerous team.’ The difference in approach to the match could not be more marked. While Hansen has rung the changes, Cotter, as exclusively revealed by Sportsmail, has shown faith in the same starting XV that defeated Argentina last Saturday. ‘Logic will say we have no chance of winning this,’ he said. ‘Reasonable people will say we have no chance but our players have big hearts and want to give this a crack. ‘We are focusing on what we can do and how we can stay in there and be competitive right to the end.’","All Blacks boss Hansen made 13 changes to the team who defeated England 24-21 at Twickenham .

"An Olympic gold medal, comparisons to Michael Phelps and even praise from teen heartthrob Justin Bieber - not a bad way to spend the summer vacation before your senior year of high school. But Missy Franklin is taking it all in her stride. After qualifying for a record seven races in women's Olympics swimming events, Franklin has already nabbed a gold and a team bronze - fast propelling her into the hearts of Americans and sports fans. Despite her amazing feats, Franklin has refused to accept cash prizes or sponsorship deals. Instead she is holding on to her amateur status so she can swim for a college team - when she is old enough. America's golden girl: Missy Franklin poses with her gold medal for the women's 100-meter backstroke . And her aggressive performances in the water . could not be further from her gentle demeanor when she climbs out, reverting back to the modest school girl who looks almost surprised to . be there. 'I dreamed about this moment my whole life,' Franklin gushed after winning the gold medal in  the women's 100-metre backstroke on Monday. 'I finally got one after 17 years!' Franklin, an only child from Centennial, Colorado,  credits the unwavering support of her parents, D.A. and Dick, for her success. It was thanks to encouragement from her father, a former senior executive of Reebok who now works for a non-profit environmental company, and his wife that Franklin pursued the sport, she said. Young talent: Missy, pictured, began swimming lessons as a toddler after he parents spotted her talent . At home: Missy is the only child of DA Franklin, pictured, and her husband Dick . Patriotic: Her parents are Canadian but Missy, dressed in patriotic colours, left, chose to swim for the U.S. 'They have been the best support in . the whole world,' she told NBC's Today show. 'I know that no matter what I do at any . meet, if I do my best they are going to be proud of me.' When Franklin was two years old, she was . in the sea with her mother when a fish caught her eye and she paddled . after it - leaving her mother behind in the 12-foot deep water. And so the love affair began: Home . movies show Franklin paddling frantically towards her father, barely . able to keep her head above water - but celebrating with her parents . when she got there. This determination torpedoed Franklin to the 2008 United States Olympic Trials when she was just 13, and later to the Pan Pacific Championships as the youngest United States team member at 15. Early days: She swims with her mother, who says Missy has smiled since the day she was born . Always ahead: A home video shows her beating her classmates during a elementary school meet . At home: Franklin shocked her parents when she swam alone, aged two, and took her to swimming lessons . By 16, she had achieved a world . record in short-course metres in the 200 backstroke and won five medals, . including three golds, at the 2011 world championships in Shanghai. Height 6 ft 1 . With such height - the average girl her age is 5 ft 4 - Franklin has less wave drag and is able to glide easier through the water. She can take turns faster as she reaches the wall long before the centre of her body does . Wingspan 6 ft 4 . The lengthy measurement from fingertip to fingertip means she can pull her body further . Feet Size 13 . Her large feet, which are five sizes larger than the average U.S. woman's, act like flippers through the water . Hands 8 1/2 inches from wrist to fingertip . Like her feet, the large hands act as paddles. With greater surface area, she has more thrust through the pool . Shoulders 18 inches . Her shoulders mean her torso is wider at the top than at her narrow hips, which makes a more streamlined shape through the water . The teen is built for success, with a powerful 6-foot-1 frame, size 13 feet that act as flippers and a . 6-foot-4-inch wingspan. Her hands measure eight-and-a-half . inches from her wrist to her longest fingertip, which she uses as a paddle to power her through the water. It is the frame she hopes can help her win an . unprecedented seven medals at the Games - one of the reasons she is . often referred to as the female Michael Phelps. As her parents are Canadian, they . offered their daughter the option to swim for Canada, but their daughter . refused, pointing out the support she has had from her hometown and . high school. Franklin manages to squeeze hours of training around her schoolwork, exam prep and social life at Regis Jesuit High School in Aurora, Colorado, but admits it's not always easy. 'Swimming - there's so much energy . you have to put into it and I want to go to practice and work hard, so . there's days when I can't stay out late, I can't go out with my . friends,' she said. In a recent interview with NBC, she . burst into giggles over Justin Bieber and boyband One Direction - . reminding audiences of the Olympian's young age. And . the admiration is mutual, as Bieber tweeted on Tuesday: 'heard . @FranklinMissy is a fan of mine. now im a fan of hers too. CONGRATS on . winning GOLD! #muchlove' Thankful: Missy, an only child, credits the support of her parents DA and Dick Franklin, for her success . Encouragement: A younger Missy with her parents, who travel with her to competitions across the globe . Normal teen: Missy, who will start her senior year of high school this fall, also manages to maintain a normal life as a teen. Here, she is pictured with her date for her prom earlier this summer . Franklin tweeted in response: 'I just died. Thank you!' Amid the high pressure of Olympic . races, high school exams and teen boybands, Franklin has also found time . to think of others, paying tribute to the victims of the recent . Colorado shootings. The . teen attends school and trains in Aurora - the town where a gunman . slayed 12 and injured 58 in a shooting spree during a screening of The . Dark Knight Rises on July 20. 'Every . single race I’m going to have that in the back of my mind,' she said . before the Olympics. 'Hopefully, I can make Colorado proud and bring a . little bit of light there.' With her all-American image and outstanding performances in the pool, there is a fair buck for the youngster to make. But although companies are offering lucrative sponsorship deals and the country's top coaches and high-profile agents have been banging at her door for years, Franklin has turned them away. Spirit: Missy, who says she particularly loves the team aspect of the Olympics, celebrates a school win . Popular: Missy, with friends from her school swimming team, attends a Jesuit high school in Colorado . Night out: The swimmer, pictured with a school friend, said she often has to skip socialising to train . Bob . Dorfman, the executive creative director at a San Francisco advertising . firm, said she may be giving up the chance to make more than $1 million . in endorsements if her success continues. 'If . you use Phelps as a gauge and how much he’s made, it’s maybe in the low . seven figures that she could be leaving on the table,' Dorfman told . Bloomberg. She has already given up $115,000 in . prize money; the U.S. Olympic Committee pays gold medallists $25,000 and . USA adds a $75,000 bonus. Her bronze would have earned her $15,000. But Franklin remains firm about turning down the cash in exchange for an amateur career and a place swimming for a college. 'Swimming in college has always been a . dream of mine,' she said. 'It just seems amazing. I want to be a part of it.' Famous fan: Singer Justin Bieber tweeted his praise to Missy - who responded: 'I just died! Thankyou!' Joy: Franklin, pictured on Monday, said she swims because she loves it - not because of the money to be made . Camaraderie: She hugs Australia's Belinda Hocking, right, after they took first and second place in the race . Whether she can maintain such resistance as the races - and hopefully trips to the podium - continue, remains to be seen. 'Right now I'm doing what I love,' she added. 'That's honestly the reason why I'm doing it.' And that love is paying off. Franklin stunned spectators when minutes after swimming a 200m freestyle semifinal heat, she climbed back in the pool to win gold in the 100m backstroke on Monday. 'I am, so happy, I knew that tonight was . definitely going to be difficult, with that double, but I had a blast . tonight,' Franklin said afterwards. She appeared in disbelief as she was awarded her medal, every emotion dancing in her eyes as the national anthem played. Teamwork: Missy, right, also took a bronze medal in the women's 4x100-metre freestyle relay on Saturday. She is pictured with, from left, Lia Neal, Allison Schmitt and Jessica Hardy . Advice: She has been called the female Michael Phelps, right, as she is also in line for numerous medals . Smile of a winner: Missy Franklin's next chance at a medal is on Tuesday night in the 200m freestyle swim . 'I was trying to sing,' she said. 'But . I was crying at the same time and I forgot the words because I didn't . know what I was doing. I was just a huge mess. 'But seeing that flag being raised was so incredibly unbelievable. I could have never dreamed it would feel like that.' She still has a fair few battles on her hands to achieve her dream of securing seven medals, placing her ahead of Natalie Coughlin, the first U.S. woman to win six medals in one Olympics in Beijing 2008. Her next shot at a third medal comes at Tuesday night's 200m freestyle swim. 'I know that it's going to be tough,' she said. 'But like Michael [Phelps] said, it's all mental and I think that I'm prepared to do it.'","Missy Franklin wins gold and bronze in first two Olympic races .

"Arsene Wenger lost the plot after Jose Mourinho’s unbeaten run against Arsenal increased to 12 games after Chelsea’s 2-0 victory at Stamford Bridge. The Arsenal manager insisted he had no regrets for the shove on Mourinho when his incredible Barclays Premier League clash erupted after just 20 minutes. Wenger said: ‘I don’t regret it, what is there to regret? I want to go from A to B and someone (Mourinho) confronted me before I got to B without any sign of a welcome.’ Arsene Wenger shoves Jose Mourinho in the chest with about 20 minutes gone at Stamford Bridge on Sunday . Wenger, 64, pushed Mourinho in the chest with the Portuguese manager of Chelsea stumbling backwards . Wenger squares up to Chelsea manager Mourinho on the touchline during Sunday's Premier League match . Wenger and Mourinho had to be separated by fourth official Jonathan Moss as their rivalry showed itself . It's the longest-running feud in the Premier League... but where did it start? Chelsea took the lead when Eden Hazard scored with a penalty and former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas set up Diego Costa for his ninth goal this season. Wenger claimed Gary Cahill should have already been sent off for the foul on Alexis Sanchez that provoked the flare-up between the two technical areas. The Arsenal chief, whose side are now a staggering nine points behind league leaders Chelsea, also claimed Oscar and Branislav Ivanovic should have been sent off. Wenger will face no further action from the FA because it was dealt with at the time by referee Martin Atkinson and fourth official Jonathan Moss. Wenger will also have to deal with an open show of dissent from Santi Cazorla and Jack Wilshere when they were substituted on Sunday. Both shook their heads repeatedly at the decision when they walked off the pitch and again when they sat on the substitutes’ bench in the second half. He said: ‘A red card for Cahill wouldn’t surprise you if you watched it again. I went to Sanchez to see how badly he was injured. Gary Cahill lunges in on Alexis Sanchez during the feisty London derby between rivals Chelsea and Arsenal . Cahill goes through Sanchez to get the ball and it started the feud between managers Wenger and Mourinho . Cahill fouls Sanchez, Arsenal's new signing from Barcelona, and was yellow carded by referee Martin Atkinson . A one-man team? Chelsea are so much more than that this season. Those who believe the title race rests on the hamstrings of Diego Costa may have to reconsider after this. For a good 75 minutes, Arsenal snuffed out Costa’s threat. It did not matter. Chelsea were still on course for victory, through the quite brilliant Eden Hazard. CLICK HERE for Martin Samuel's full match report from Stamford Bridge . ‘Oscar was lucky to stay on the pitch with his repeated fouling and he was only booked in the 88th minute. He was purposely fouling. Then there is Ivanovic as well with bad fouls, but it’s down to the referee, not to me. ‘I trust you will all teach me the moral lessons over the next two weeks and I can accept that. I am long enough in the game to see things the right way. I don’t listen to what Mourinho says. ‘You would see if I really tried to push you, come on.’ On Sunday night, Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was undergoing neurological tests in a local hospital after he was forced off with concussion. Courtois suffered the injury when he was caught accidentally in the head by Sanchez’s knee when he was clean through on goal in the tenth minute. He continued but was substituted with blood pouring from his ear 14 minutes later and replaced by former Chelsea No 1 Petr Cech. Courtois is in the Belgian squad for Euro 2016 qualifiers with Andorra on Friday and Bosnia the following week, but it seems unlikely that he will take part.

Courtois is escorted up the tunnel and the No 1 Chelsea goalkeeper was immediately treated by paramedics . Mourinho said: ‘He has gone to hospital for a precaution, but we think nothing special will happen. ‘On the bench I don't communicate with the doctors. I just get decisions. Can he stay? Yes. He has to leave? Okay. First they said yes he could continue, then no. I was just worried for the kid. ‘I was not worried about the game or the performance: we have two of the three best keepers in the world, so when one is injured and comes off, no problem, no change in the team. I was confident that Petr would do a fantastic job for us. ‘We have Dr Biovksa, the head of the medical department, and he has his people. I always tell them that, when I'm on the bench, I don't want to communicate with them. I just want them to give me a decision. ‘They gave me their decision. For me, that's correct.

"Stuart Lancaster has implored England fans to show respect while supporting his team, as the RFU continue to investigate allegations that referee Nigel Owens was subjected to homophobic abuse at Twickenham last Saturday. The union’s disciplinary officer, Gerard McEvilly, was thought to be in contact with a spectator, Keith Wilson, who has complained about comments made by fans sitting near him — aimed at Welsh official Owens, who is gay. In a letter, Mr Wilson referred to ‘nasty, foul-mouthed, racist, homophobic abuse’ during England’s match against New Zealand, while adding the ‘vitriol’ left him feeling ‘ashamed’. Owens, who has been known to joke about his sexuality during matches, responded to the allegations by urging the RFU to ban for life anyone found guilty of such abuse, saying: ‘They need to be told that some behaviour is not acceptable, that crossing the line of what is humour and banter is a fine line, but if you cross it then you have to put up with the consequences.’ Stuart Lancaster has urged England supporters to show respect while supporting his side at Twickenham . Referee Nigel Owens was allegedly subjected to homophobic abuse at Twickenham last Saturday . Another sell-out crowd will be at HQ tomorrow for England’s second QBE Test, against South Africa, and national coach Lancaster yesterday found himself dealing with the alleged misconduct of England supporters. He has made a concerted effort to generate greater noise and fervour in the Twickenham stands, but urged those in attendance to moderate their behaviour towards officials and visiting players. ‘Generally you want a crowd that is behind the team but respecting the core values of the sport,’ said Lancaster. ‘That balance should easily be able to be achieved. That is what we feel the crowd give us. They give us a huge amount of energy. ‘I go back to the core values of what we are about. One of those is respect. I think we need to show that as a team and as a country to all opposition players, coaches, referees and opposition spectators as well.’ Chris Robshaw (left) takes a pass from England number eight Billy Vunipola at Pennyhill Park . The England squad are all smiles as they gear up for their clash with the Springboks on Saturday . England and Saracens fly-half Owen Farrell fires out a pass as Bath lock Dave Attwood watches on . In reference to the claims Owens was abused by England fans, Lancaster added: ‘I met Nigel on Friday before the game. We had a great conversation about the game and about how we were going to approach the game and I think we all, as international coaches, understand the pressure referees are under. We are all under pressure. Every decision gets analysed — every decision a player makes, every decision a coach makes and every decision a referee makes. ‘We have to understand the pressures people are under and be supportive. Certainly that is all we want to do and achieve with the referees. Having met Nigel on Friday, we want him to have an enjoyable experience coming to England and it is a shame if he feels that memory has been tarnished.

Referee: Steve Walsh (NZ) TV/Radio: LIVE on Sky Sports 1 and BBC 5 Live from 2pm (kick-off 2.30pm) ‘I’m aware there’s an investigation going on and rightly so. We applaud the stance the RFU are taking and the investigation. We’ve worked hard in rugby to get the core values of the sport ingrained in the team and in rugby in general, so there is no place for this whatsoever. Respecting the kicker, respecting the opposition and all those things you see are important.’ RFU chief Ian Ritchie endorsed Lancaster’s view on Thursday night, saying: ‘The RFU condemns all discrimination. We aim to ensure everyone has the opportunity to enjoy rugby in an environment free from all prejudices. We take allegations of abuse very seriously and are investigating. If we find sufficient evidence we will take action.’ One factor which possibly contributed to the ill-will towards Owens in the game was marginal refereeing decisions repeatedly being shown on the big screen. A particularly close call, which led to a try for New Zealand’s Aaron Cruden, prompted sustained anger among home fans after footage was shown several times. Following the game, New Zealand coach Steve Hansen decried what he suggested was the scourge of TV producers dictating the officiating process, in favour of the hosts, by screening contentious moments until there is a referral to the Television Match Official. In this case, the live feed at Twickenham was supplied by Sky. Robshaw gets through a warm-up exercise with his Harlequins and England team-mate Joe Marler (left) Lawes (left) leads his fellow England team-mates through a speed drill at the team's training base in London . Lancaster was at pains to emphasise this is not a matter of English propaganda at work, but a global issue. ‘Generally there are more screens in stadiums now and more decisions that get replayed,’ he said. ‘In the South Africa v New Zealand game (during the Rugby Championship) there was an incident which was constantly replayed and Wayne Barnes’s attention was drawn to it. ‘He went back to look at it and it was a penalty. It is more for debate at a higher level about the rights and wrongs of that. ‘It is not exclusive to Twickenham. I don’t have any input at the moment (into what is shown on the big screen). It is all new technology and it is more a decision for the people who run the sport and the TMO debate has to be discussed as technological advances come in. ‘A lot of countries have high-definition screens and you can see replays from different angles. In football they don’t allow it at all. So it is not for me to decide or get involved in it in the middle of this series.’ Another disruption in the build-up to tomorrow’s encounter with the Springboks is the news that Samoa’s players have considered boycotting their match at Twickenham a week tomorrow, due to unrest over pay and alleged managerial incompetence. However, Lancaster played down the threat, saying: ‘I was aware of it a couple of weeks ago as something that was potentially an issue, but my understanding is it has all been resolved.’ VIDEO O2 Inside Line, Season 5 - Episode 2 .","The union’s disciplinary officer, Gerard McEvilly, was thought to be in contact with a spectator, Keith Wilson, who has complained about comments made by fans sitting near him aimed at Nigel Owens .

"Southwest Airlines and SeaWorld Entertainment are ending their 25-year-old marketing partnership, officials with both companies said Thursday, after the airline was urged by animal rights activists to terminate the relationship. The partnership won't be renewed at the end of the year when the current contract expires. As part of the partnership, three Southwest airplanes had various SeaWorld animals painted on their bodies. Those planes will be painted over to Southwest's traditional look. SeaWorld also had Southwest signs in its parks, and Southwest offered vacation packages to SeaWorld, as it does to other tourist destinations. Whale air: Southwest Airlines and SeaWorld will end a 25-year marketing partnership in December amid mounting calls by animal rights activists for the airline to walk away from an arrangement that resulted in three of its planes being painted with SeaWorld animals . Fallout: SeaWorld has fielded a constant backlash since the 2013 release of documentary Blackfish, which chronicled the aquarium's 39-year treatment of killer whales in captivity . SeaWorld officials said the decision was mutual. SeaWorld wants to concentrate on growing markets in Latin America and Asia, the marine park company said in a statement. 'Southwest and SeaWorld have enjoyed their long relationship, and wish each other continued success,' the statement said. SeaWorld has parks in Orlando, Florida; San Antonio and San Diego. Southwest spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said it was a business decision as the airline intends to focus on international service. Earlier this year, animal rights activist held a rally and dropped off a petition at Southwest, urging the airline to end the relationship. The activists cited the documentary Blackfish, which explores what may have caused the killer whale Tilikum to kill SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010. The documentary argues that killer whales, when in captivity, become more aggressive to humans and each other. Tragedy: The end of the SouthWestern contract comes four years . after the death of trainer Dawn Brancheau, who was dismembered after . being dragged underwater by  killer whale Tilikum . Since the documentary, several entertainers have pulled out of planned performances at SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. parks. Regarding the pressure from the activists, McInnis said Southwest has been in 'listening and education mode'. 'We ... have engaged and heard from conservationists, SeaWorld supporters, and others on all sides of this issue,' McInnis said. The president of the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said in a statement that workers in her office were delighted to hear the partnership was ending. 'Champagne corks were popping at PETA today when we heard that Southwest will no longer support SeaWorld and will repaint its planes,' said Ingrid Newkirk. 'The second I heard the good news, I knew that I'd be booking my next trip on Southwest.'","Contract between the companies expires in December and will not be renewed, Southwest said Friday .

'I can imagine the memory of their bodies close to mine and the love in my heart will always be open for them. My arms will always be reaching for them.' The mother of three, who was reduced to tears when remembering her children and father, was speaking publicly for the first time since her and husband Anthony released a statement about the 'hell beyond hell' they were living through following the crash. 'My three kids filled my world with a joy like a huge and ginormous balloon filled with lollies chuckles, sunshine and indescribable happiness. 'They taught me so much these wise little teachers, they taught me the names of the dockers players and the rules of AFL.' 'They taught me to speak Chinese and all the capital cities... how to climb trees, Ben and Jerry's ice cream flavours and that chips in milkshakes actually taste pretty good.'

He described his children, aged 12, 10 and 8, as 'unblemished, innocent, perfect souls'. 'It may give all of you some perspective to remember that the only thing worse for us than the hell beyond hell that we are going through now is the horrific thought that our family had never existed,' he said.

"There are more registered sex offenders living in the community in England and Wales than ever before, new figures show. Probation workers are now monitoring 43,664 sexual predators, compared to 32,347 in 2008-2009, according to the latest Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) report. The figure has gone up because more sex offenders are being imprisoned, for longer, and then being supervised by police and probation officers, the report says. There are more sex offenders living under supervision in the community in England and Wales than ever before (file image) Another reason for the growing number of sex offenders is thought to be more people being caught downloading porn. Coming a week after it was revealed that sex offenders were being released without undergoing any treatment to address their behaviour because of a shortage of places, the latest report showed that over the past five years, almost 400 sex offenders were charged with further serious offences. And despite surveillance by public protection agencies, 7,294 offenders breached their licence. Meanwhile the number of violent offenders living in the community under supervision has also gone up. The report by MAPPA, under which umbrella police officers, probation workers and staff from other public protection agencies work to supervise known offenders in the community, gives figures for the year 2012-2013. It shows there are now 16,140 violent offenders being monitored by probation services, up from 11,689 in 2008-2009, and that more than 300 of them have committed further serious offences in that time. Today, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said that the average sentence length for those convicted of sexual offences had gone up from 40 months in 2003 to more than 55 months in 2013. Justice Minister Jeremy Wright, left, said more offenders were given longer sentences and supervision orders; meanwhile Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, right, has postponed the privatisation of the probation service . And Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said the increase in the number of sex offenders being supervised meant his team were simply doing a better job. He said: 'We make no apology for high numbers of offenders in prison who have committed violent and sexual offences – and for them serving longer sentences. 'This is crucial for public safety, and is exactly why we are scrapping automatic early release for child rapists. 'We make no apology for high numbers of offenders in prison who have committed violent and sexual offences - and for them serving longer sentences.' Justice Minister Jeremy Wright . 'When offenders are released, we are making them subject to longer and more robust periods of supervision that include monitoring by the police and probation services and use of GPS satellite tags. 'These allow us to keep closer watch on offenders and make our communities safer. Sex offenders will also be forced to take lie detector tests. 'Any supervised offenders who give cause for concern can be recalled to prison immediately.' Last week concerns were raised about the number of sex offenders being released into the community without their behaviour having been addressed while they were in prison. Prison . reports showed that despite the number of convicted sex offenders . rising, the number of offenders being treated for the causes of their . crimes had fallen. And the Justice Secretary Chris Grayling put back the deadline for privatising . the probation service after he was told there would be public safety . issues if he went ahead. He delayed the privatisation of 70 per cent of the probation service by two months to give the new 'community rehabilitation companies' time to test their working methods before going live.","There are 43,664 known, convicted sexual predators in England and Wales being monitored by police and probation officers .

"Edgy Californian graffiti artist David Choe has been forced to deny he is a rapist after claims he made on a podcast caused outcry. The artist, who made his fortune by asking to be paid in Facebook stock when he painted a mural at its offices, had told a lurid story about how he forced a masseuse to sexually stimulate him. But after a backlash in which the artist and writer was branded a rapist, he has been forced to admit he had made the story up. Defense: David Choe has admitted he made up a story about an encounter that led to accusations of rape . Shock jock: David Choe was accused of being a rapist over a tale he made up on his podcast . Choe had given his co-hosts on a podcast an explicit description of an encounter which he claimed at the time had happened in a Los Angeles spa. He described his encounter as an 'erection quest' and gave a vivid description of forcing the woman massaging him to give him oral sex even though she had 'given me no signs that she's into me or that this is appropriate behavior'. He added that the 'thrill of possibly going to jail, that's what achieved the erection quest'. When his co-hosts pointed out his behavior was akin to rape, the artist had joked that 'she said yes with her eyes'. His flippant attitude and description of forcing the woman into a sexual encounter caused outrage online after the podcast aired last month. In response to the accusations that he was guilty of rape, Choe released a statement to Gawker saying he had made up the story as an extension to his edgy art. Challenging: Choe says the lurid tale was part of his podcast's aim to challenge and provoke . 'I never thought I'd wake up one late afternoon and hear myself called a rapist. It sucks. Especially because I am not one. I am not a rapist. I hate rapists, I think rapists should be raped and murdered.' he said. 'If I am guilty of anything, it's bad storytelling in the style of douche. Just like many of my paintings are often misinterpreted, the same goes with my show.' The statement added: 'The main objective of all of my podcasts is to challenge and provoke my friends and the co-stars on the show ... It's a dark, tasteless, completely irreverent show.' The artist had been harassed online for his massage parlor tale, with some concerned listeners even reaching out to Vice magazine, which he contributes to. One of . them, Darn Small, posted on the Vice Facebook page: 'Out of curiosity, what do . you make of this story by David Choe ... is he admitting to raping a . girl? I feel quite uneasy after listening to this.' Others commented that his actions had been 'inexcusable' and that it had tarnished the way they viewed his art.","David Choe claims lurid encounter described on the show never took place .

The heckler was a pro-immigration-reform protester holding a handwritten sign reading ‘#Not1More.’ ‘The problem is, I’m actually for immigration reform,’ said Obama. ‘Of course, he should be protesting the folks who are blocking it, but that’s OK.’ A heckler who interrupted President Obama's campaign speech for Maryland Gubernatorial Democrat candidate Lt. Governor Anthony Brown is escorted out of the gymnasium at Sunday's Early Vote Rally . Many Democrats have been wary of appearing with the president during their election races because of his sagging popularity . A steady stream of people started to leave the Maryland rally not long after the president took to the podium . Also on Sunday, the president returned to the accepting embrace of his home state of Illinois to support Governor Pat Quinn, who is running for re-election. The president told voters that Republicans mean well, but ‘just have bad ideas.’ He accused the GOP of recycling those ideas over and over, urging voters to take their future into their own hands by electing Democrats on Nov. 4. ‘The power to move our society, our government, it really is in your hands,’ Obama said during the Illinois rally that doubled as a homecoming for the president. ‘You're the reason that I had the audacity to actually run for president of the United States.’ Echoing many of the same themes as his own 2008 and 2012 campaigns, Obama said Democrats were fighting to give women equal pay, give children a good education and give all Americans access to decent health care.

Happy to be home: President Barack Obama salutes as he walks off of Air Force One after arriving at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago on Sunday . He contrasted that with the policies of Republicans, whom he claimed were living in the 1950s and belong ‘in a Mad Men episode.’ Obama's rallies Sunday in Chicago and Maryland marked his first major foray into the 2014 midterm elections. He was supposed to rally last week in Connecticut for Gov. Dannel Malloy, but postponed that visit to focus on Ebola. Though limited in his ability to help his party this year, Obama has sought to use his own policies, like a minimum wage hike, to frame an economic message that can lift up Democratic candidates across the country. In radio ads and other appearances, Obama has also sought to rev up the same voting blocs that helped elect him twice - including minorities, women and young people - in hopes they'll show up this year even without Obama on the ballot. Speaking at a rally in Chicago on Sunday, the president claimed the Republicans were living in the 1950s and belong 'in a Mad Men episode' 'We're in the fight of our lives for the soul of Illinois' democracy. They may have more money,' Quinn said of his opponent, Republican Bruce Rauner. 'But we've got President Barack Obama.' Obama picked out people from the crowd whom he knew, and seemed to relish being back in Illinois. ‘It's good to be home,’ Obama said. ‘I care about what happens here,’ he said to applause. Early voting in Illinois starts on Monday for the Nov. 4, election. The president plans to cast his vote early on Monday and is scheduled to spend the night at his Chicago home. In the coming weeks he will rally for another half-dozen Democratic candidates for governor, but is not venturing into the conservative-leaning states where Democrats are fighting their toughest Senate races. Obama's help, or lack thereof, may not matter much to Brown, who is 11 points ahead of Republican opponent Larry Hogan, according to an average of polls by RealClearPolitics. Quinn's race is tighter. He is ahead of Republican Bruce Rauner by 1.8 points, according to the RealClearPolitics average. Meet the president: Obama shakes hands with supporters during a campaign rally for Gov.

"Stuart Lancaster expects England's QBE International against Samoa at Twickenham on Saturday week to go ahead as planned despite the threat of strike action by the tourists. The International Rugby Board announced on Wednesday that Samoa's players had warned they may boycott the game over concerns surrounding administration of the Samoa Rugby Union. However, England head coach Lancaster believes the penultimate game of England's autumn campaign will go ahead. England coach Stuart Lancaster oversees his team's training session at Pennyhill Park on Thursday . 'I was aware of this a couple of weeks ago, but my understanding is that it has all been resolved. This is something that was potentially an issue,' Lancaster said. The IRB had confirmed there had been 'an indication' that Samoa's players would withdraw from next week's clash, but is hopeful the matter will be resolved. He added: 'We engaged in dialogue with the Samoa Rugby Union and the International Rugby Players' Association to facilitate urgent and collaborative resolution.

Investigators are still looking in to what exactly may have caused the crash. They are inspecting the 1995 BMW for signs of mechanical failure that might have contributed to the incident. It has also been suggested that speed was a factor based on skid marks the freeway and the distance that the car traveled after hitting the guardrail. Drugs and alcohol were not involved.","Five teens died when BMW hit guardrail, rolled and caught fire on Saturday .

"Tens of thousands of NHS patients are having operations to clear their arteries in the false belief that it will cut their chance of a heart attack or even extend their life, a leading expert has warned. Doctors are failing to tell patients that angioplasty is not a magic bullet to stop heart attacks, said consultant cardiologist Aseem Malhotra. Each year some 30,000 people with a condition called stable angina opt to have the procedure, in which a tiny balloon is inserted into clogged arteries to help clear them. Tens of thousands of NHS patients are having operations to clear their arteries in the false belief that it will cut their chance of a heart attack or extend their life, according to  leading expert Aseem Malhotra (file picture) A metal ring called a stent is then put in to keep the artery wide. The theory is that widening the artery will improve blood flow and reduce the odds of a blockage. But Dr Malhotra said such patients were rarely told that the invasive procedure made no difference to their chance of having a heart attack, nor did it improve their odds of long life. He said: ‘Patients often have this treatment believing it will save them from a heart attack or prolong their life. But there is no convincing scientific evidence that this is true. ‘Cardiologists who stent patients with stable angina are frequently not giving this information to patients.’ Dr Aseem Malhotra said patients were rarely told that the invasive procedure made no difference to their chance of having a heart attack . Patients with stable angina experience chest pain, caused by restricted blood flow, brought on by a trigger, such as exercise or stress. Dr Malhotra cited a US study that found nine in ten patients with stable angina wrongly believed that angioplasty would cut their chance of a heart attack. The operation is also used as an emergency procedure to help maintain blood flow in patients who have suffered a heart attack. About 60,000 patients a year receive angioplasty in these circumstances. Dr Malhotra emphasised there  was good evidence to show it helped save the lives of such patients. He also said angioplasty could help reduce the frequency and severity of chest pain in those with stable angina. But he said patients with stable angina should be given all the information before making a decision on surgery. And he said they should be told that leading a healthy lifestyle and taking drugs such as statins could cut the chance of a heart attack. ‘Doctors should give them all the information before subjecting them to treatment,’ he added. His comments were backed up by NHS England’s heart disease ‘tsar’, Professor Huon Gray. He said: ‘There is no evidence that coronary angioplasty reduces risk of heart attack or death in patients with uncomplicated stable angina, and it is important that doctors are clear with their patients about this.’","Tens of thousands of NHS patients having operations to clear arteries .

"Bodies of dead puffins have been found washed up on the bays of France and Spain, provoking worries that the storms have thinned their numbers . Thousands of puffins are feared to have been killed in the recent storms that have hammered the UK for the last month. The British Trust for Ornithology said today it’s received a record number of reports of puffins, wearing uniquely-numbered metal rings showing they are from the UK, being washed up dead on the coasts of France and Spain. It’s feared they have been wiped out in their thousands while hunting far out to sea in the storm-lashed Bay of Biscay for their favourite food, sand eels. BTO spokesman Paul Stancliffe said: 'Sadly, the sight of a puffin, beak full of sand eels, might be a little harder to come by this summer as they struggle to survive the recent storms that have rocked the Bay of Biscay.' In a normal winter, the BTO would expect two or three ringed puffins to be found in the Bay, which covers western France and northern Spain, but during the last few weeks, more than 35 have been reported and countless more are feared to have been drowned and lost forever far out at sea. The previous highest number of ringed birds found was back in 1979 when 17 dead puffins were reported. British puffins head out into the Atlantic for the winter months, riding out the worst that the weather can throw at them. As the winter progresses, they make their way back into the Bay of Biscay before heading home to their breeding colonies and the burrows and tunnels in the ground on clifftops that they used the previous summer. The BTO says that puffins found in this winter’s so-called ‘wreck’, have come from colonies in west Wales, northern Scotland, Orkney and Shetland. Mark Grantham, ringing officer at the BTO, said 'Up until the last couple of weeks it seemed that our puffins might have survived the worst of the winter. Normal winters would have brought 3 or 4 puffins to the Bay of Biscay, but this winter saw 35, with countless more thought to have drowned in the ocean . The previous high number of puffins found on the bay, 17 back in 1979, has been shattered this year . 'However, from the reports of ringed birds that are being washed up on the Biscay beaches it would seem that the recent storms were just too much for many of the puffins. 'It is still early days and the number of ringed birds found is likely to rise further, but we must remember that if over 35 ringed birds have been found, many un-ringed birds must have been affected too.' Bird ringing in the UK is organised by the BTO and is carried out by licensed volunteers, who ring over a million birds of a wide variety of different species every year. It is the information received from these rings, when found and reported to the BTO, that enables scientists at the Trust to chart events such as this.","Record numbers of puffins have been washed up on Bay of Biscay .
A few die each year, but recently many more have died due to storm weather .

"Graham Rowntree has vowed England will confront South Africa with 'all guns blazing' at Twickenham on Saturday as they seek to atone for a losing start to the QBE Series. The ambition of issuing a statement of intent against New Zealand ahead of next year's World Cup was dashed by a 24-21 defeat that saw Stuart Lancaster's men picked apart in a one-sided second half. England have not toppled the Springboks in 11 meetings dating back to 2006 and a loss this weekend would represent their worst sequence of results for eight years. Graham Rowntree the forwards on scrummaging technique during their training session at Pennyhill Park . 'We've got to beat these big southern hemisphere teams at Twickenham. South Africa are the next to come to our stadium. We've got to beat them, we know that, and we'll go in all guns blazing to do that,' Rowntree said. 'We can't hide from the fact that we lost the last four games, albeit against the world champion. There's been no hiding place since the New Zealand game - we had some very frank discussions.' England's South African-born attacking skills coach Mike Catt described the Springboks as the 'big green machine' and it is a view shared by Rowntree, who faced them three times as a player. Dave Attwood speaks to Graham Rowntree at Twickenham stadium during England training . 'They're a very abrasive outfit. They'll always be up there as one of the best packs. Physically and genetically they're big men. They play a very powerful brand of rugby,' Rowntree said. 'Their pack will always be there or thereabouts. They're certainly one of the heaviest. You know when you've played them because the players will be sore for a few days after the game. 'They're technically very well drilled and have a lot of experience. They like to use line-outs for drives and their scrum is a big focal point of their physicality. 'You'll see how they bind on to each other before they receive the ball, then they like to run through as a band of players. They like to impose themselves on the opposition as early as they can.' Stuart Lancaster and Rowntree talk tactics ahead of England's crucial clash with South Africa . Head coach Heyneke Meyer is trying to make South Africa a more expansive team and the tourists have had their own wounds to lick after following up an impressive victory over New Zealand with last weekend's 29-15 defeat by Ireland in Dublin. Rowntree, however, expects England to face the traditional route one approach in the second of their four Tests this autumn. 'Potentially they could play in a different way to what we'd expect, but in patches against Ireland they reverted to type. They scored a try from a driving maul and their scrum was very strong,' Rowntree said. 'They have a good variety in the squad to back up any style of play, but I'm expecting a power game against us.' England have been honest in appraising their shortcomings against New Zealand, highlighting their poor game management for their inability to triumph having led 14-11 at half-time. In a show of faith Lancaster has retained the players who under performed against the All Blacks, making just one injury-enforced change to the starting XV with Anthony Watson given his full debut on the right wing as a replacement for Semesa Rokoduguni, who has a thigh complaint. It will be a new-look side that takes to the field against Samoa next Saturday, before Lancaster reverts to his strongest line-up for the concluding international against Australia. 'It will be a huge challenge against South Africa, but we need this challenge after last week,' Rowntree said.","England face South Africa in their next QBE Series match at Twickenham .

"A teenage boy cannot stop growing, shooting up eight inches in just a year, after a tumour the size of a golf ball was removed from his brain. Keiran Halliday was suffering severe headaches, prompting his GP to refer him to Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales. There, doctors discovered the pain was being caused by an unusual growth. Surgeons operated on the now 19-year-old, removing the tumour. But Keiran, from Bridgend in South Wales, was then diagnosed with acromegaly - where the body produces too much growth hormone. Keiran Halliday, 19, from Bridgend, South Wales, was diagnosed with acromegaly - a condition where the body produces too much growth hormone - after having a tumour removed from his brain. He has shot up eight inches in the last year, and now towers above his mother Caroline . Since developing acromegaly Keiran has outgrown most of his clothes and shoes, his mother Caroline said. The condition caused him to put on weight and suffer seizures . Keiran was suffering severe headaches before his GP referred him to University Hospital of Wales where doctors discovered a tumour the size of a golf ball in his brain . Doctors believe the tumour caused the teenager's body to begin producing excess growth hormone . As a result he has grown eight inches, shooting up from 5ft 6ins to 6ft 2ins in the last year. This has caused Keiran to suffer seizures and gain weight. Doctors are unsure whether the teenager will stop growing, despite 12 tablets  and an injection to control his gigantism every day. His mother Caroline, 54, said Keiran is now unable to go to college or meet up with his friends for fear of suffering a seizure. She said: 'He suffered with headaches really badly so we knew there was something not right. 'The next thing we were told he had a tumour in his brain the size of a golf ball - it was a devastating thing to hear. 'I felt like I'd been hit by a steamroller - it was frightening. He had the operation just before Christmas but then we noticed over the next few months that his body was changing dramatically. 'He shot up in height and he put on loads of weight - none of his clothes would fit him so I had to buy him a whole new wardrobe. Keiran shot up eight inches in a year, from 5ft 6ins to 6ft 2ins, his feet grew from a size six to a nine and he started to gain weight . Keiran's mother Caroline said her son can no longer go to school for fear of suffering seizures, another symptom of his condition . 'He was diagnosed with acromegaly earlier this year and doctors have given him 12 different pills to take every day as well as a daily injection to combat the hormones. 'But even now doctors don't know if he'll stop growing or not - it's devastating for Keiran and myself because he just wants to live a normal life like any other teenager.' Acromegaly is caused by the body producing too much growth hormone. It results in the growth of body tissues over time. Typical features include: . The condition affects around six in every 100,000 adults and is extremely rare in childhood. Acromegaly is often caused by a benign (non-cancerous) brain tumour, called an adenoma. Doctors first spotted Keiran's tumour in September last year but they thought it had burst - meaning Keiran would not need treatment. But three months later he had to go under the knife to have it removed after doctors discovered it had returned. However, the tumour had a devastating impact on Keiran as his body started producing too much growth hormones - which also saw his feet grow from a size six to a  nine in less than a year. The 19-year-old has to have regular blood tests and medication on a daily basis to control the growth hormones. He said: 'It's been really difficult for me and my mum. 'I can't go out and see my mates because I could have a seizure. 'I'm on all sorts of medication but even with all of that doctors don't actually know if I'll stop growing or not. 'I wanted to get into media but I can't go to college because of my condition. 'I just hope one day I can get back to normal and carry on with a normal life like I had before.'","Keiran Halliday was diagnosed with a brain tumour after suffering headaches .

"Russell Slade has been appointed Cardiff City manager, the Welsh club confirmed on Monday - and  owner Vincent Tan couldn't resist taking another swipe at disgraced former boss Malky Mackay. Slade resigned as Leyton Orient manager last month but the East London club and the Bluebirds had been in a dispute over Slade joining Cardiff to replace Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who departed in mid-September. The matter has now been resolved and  Tan said of his new gaffer: 'I'm delighted to appoint Russell Slade as the Manager of Cardiff City. I have personally offered Russell this opportunity after giving much thought to the needs of the Club at this point in time and firmly believe that he is the right person for the job. Former Leyton Orient boss Russell Slade has been appointed the new Cardiff City manager . Slade has already been working at Cardiff as a football consultant and was in the stands for the Bluebirds' 1-0 defeat by Blackpool on Friday . 'I have spoken to many knowledgeable people in the game about Russell, and the feedback has been extremely positive.' Tan then took a pop at former boss Malky Mackay, and said: 'He [Slade] certainly deserves to be given a chance. After all, Cardiff gave a chance to a mediocre manager from Watford and he took the club to the Premier League. I did however give him a lot of money to spend for that – in fact, too much money.' Slade, who has been working with Cardiff as a consultant since leaving Orient, said, 'I'm grateful to Vincent for giving me this opportunity as Cardiff City is a fantastic Football Club. We have a large squad and it's more than putting out the best eleven players on paper. We need the best group of players out there with the right balance and chemistry. Cardiff owner Vincent Tan said he is convinced Slade is the right man to take the club forward . 'It's now about building a relationship with the players and installing a strong ethos and work ethic. That's what I want us to take onto the pitch every week.' The 53-year-old traveled with the Cardiff squad for the 1-0 defeat by Blackpool and watched the game from the stands, and will now take over from Scott Young and Danny Gabbidon, who had been in caretaker charge since Solskjaer's departure. Tan couldn't resist taking a swipe at  former boss Malky Mackay and called the Scot a 'mediocre manager' Slade led Leyton Orient to the League One play-offs last season but resigned as manager in September . The former Notts County and Yeovil manager was also in the stands to watch Cardiff's 2-1 win against Sheffield Wednesday and the 1-1 draw at Brighton. Club owner Tan said last week he hopes Slade can stay at the club for even longer than Arsene Wenger's 18-year stint at Arsenal.","Russell Slade is the new Cardiff City manager .

"Newcastle are in talks with former Arsenal player and Lyon coach Remi Garde to take over as head coach – with the man once famous for being Arsene Wenger’s first signing in English football now favourite to take over the job from Alan Pardew. Stand-in coach John Carver has been told to take the job for another week but with Garde, who quit Lyon at the end of last season, ready to take charge immediately he is moving ahead of candidates such as Saint Etienne boss Christophe Galtier, who has said he won’t move until the summer. Garde won the French Cup during his team at Lyon and is close to Newcastle chief scout Graham Carr, who will have a big say in whom owner Mike Ashley and managing director Lee Charnley appoint. VIDEO Scroll down for John Carver: I've no idea when the new manager will be announced . Former Lyon coach Remi Garde is the favourite to take over as head coach of Newcastle . He is willing to work as a head coach rather than manager – but ultimately Newcastle will have to decide whether they are prepared to wait for Galtier at the end of the season. Carver, whose team went down 2-0 to league leaders Chelsea on Saturday, still wants the job full time and said: ‘I still haven’t had a conversation with Mike but I’ve have a conversation with Lee and he said: “Look after the game against Chelsea and possibly Southampton” and that’s what I’ll do. ‘Now that this game is out the way we’ll have tomorrow off, we’ll be back on the training ground on Monday and until I’m told otherwise I’ll prepare for the next game. I’ve no idea when they’ll make a decision but if the guys play like they did today then hopefully they’ll make the right decision.’ Garde and Galtier have long been admired from within St James’ Park – but Galtier will not walk out on his current contract in France. ‘I will stay here until the end of the season, that's for sure,’ said Galtier, whose side are currently fourth in Ligue 1. John Carver has been caretaker manager of Newcastle since the departure of Alan Pardew . Pardew steered Crystal Palace to a 2-1 win over Tottenham in his first Premier League game on Saturday . ‘I have no intention of leaving the club during the season. It would be a lack of respect towards the club, the directors. But from there to say that I'll stay until the end of my contract… things happen quickly in football. At the moment I'm really enjoying working here, but one day it will end. But I'm very clear about things. ‘It will end on good terms, properly, with a lot of respect and consideration from all parties. Afterwards I'll go to work in a place where I'll find the same atmosphere, that's very important for me.’ Galtier’s decision to stall, however, could cost him his shot at the Newcastle job.","Newcastle in talks with Remi Garde to take over as head coach .

Vacation: After killing his family, Alan shared this photo on Instagram of his friends, saying the three were staying at The Ritz-Carlton in Dallas, Texas . The young man, who was on parole for creating a credit card in his grandmother's name without her knowledge, then spent the weekend with friends, even sharing a photo on Instagram of himself that claimed he was staying at The Ritz-Carlton in Dallas, Texas. He and his friends were there to watch the University of Oklahoma football game against University of Texas. His family had been dead and undiscovered for two whole days at that point. 'College wouldn't be half as great with out these two peaches,' wrote Alan on the Instagram pic, sharing a photo of his two friends lounging on the bed. The young man also seemed to make a point of saying he was at his dorm at The University of Oklahoma on Thursday night on both his Twitter and Instagram accounts, perhaps as a way to distance himself from the scene of the murder. Alan's confession was announced earlier today by Duncan Police Chief Danny Ford. Prosecutors have said they will be considering the death penalty in this case. His next court hearing is scheduled for December 17 and he has been told to have a lawyer by December 2. The family's  housekeeper discovered the victims around 9am on Monday and told police she found the three bodies, 'cold and not breathing'. The medical examiner is performing autopsies and only said that the victims died of 'wounds' but declined to be specific, although family friends say they were shot. However, he did confirm that no weapon has been recovered from the scene and there was no evidence of forced entry. Charged: Alan Hruby (above),was on parole after creating a credit card in his grandmother's name without her permission and spending over $4,000 . Final resting place: A look at the Hrubys home, where their housekeeper found them . Big purchase: Alan shared this photo last summer of himself at the Eifel Tower in Paris with an Omega watch, around the same time he had started a card in his grandmother's name . Ford told NewsOK that the housekeeper told her daughter of the family deaths, and and she called Alan. 'My understanding is she told him something was wrong at the house and that he needed to come home,' Ford said according to NewsOk. Hruby then arrived at the house on Monday morning and broke down in hysterics when told by police his family had been killed. Ford said that Hruby was hyperventilating, crying and wailing and that he had to spend time with the station chaplain. He was then interviewed by investigators with the district attorney present as they tried to work out his whereabouts over the weekend and when he last saw his family alive. Subtle: A snap he took while on holiday in Italy shows a monogrammed Louis Vuitton wallet at the bottom right of the photo . Foodie: Even at his college dorm Alan liked to portray himself as someone with a taste for the finer things . Ford told NewsOk that the last sighting of Katherine, a junior at Duncan High School, was on Thursday and she was not in classes on Friday. Duncan police took Alan in for questioning after he returned home and also removed his SUV from the scene while he was taken to the station. All three other SUV's belonging to the victims were left parked outside their home. And on Tuesday a Stephens County District Court signed off on a probable cause affidavit for Alan for knowingly concealing stolen property. The young man seems to have a penchant for the finer things in life, sharing pictures on Instagram of Louis Vuitton wallets and Omega watches, things he seems to have purchased at the same time he had started a credit card in hius grandmother's name and racked up charges of $4,000. It is also believe he recently stole one of his mother's cards as well, or started one in her name without her knowledge. Alibi?: Alan shared a photo of the view from his dorm room at University of Oklahoma on Thursday night (above) around the time his family may have been killed, perhaps to remove himself from the scene . Doubling up: The youngster also tweeted his location Thursday evening (above) Lux life: Akan shares a photo of himself in an expensive car (above) 'It's sad. It's very shocking,' said a 21-year-old neighbor, who asked to remain unnamed, about the deaths. 'They were a good family. They would always help you out. If your car wouldn't start, they'd come over and jump it, or if your dog ran off they'd try to help you catch it. Just neighborly things.' People started getting concerned when John, 50, the publisher of the local paper, The Marlow Review, did not turn up for work on Friday morning. He also failed to cover the weekly high school football game, something he always does according to his employees. Police have been examining the house since yesterday looking for clues, and were seen carrying what appeared to be a digital video recorder out of the home yesterday afternoon. They were also examining a jeep parked on the street that neighbors claim belonged to Alan. 'At this time, The Marlow Review asks the general public for prayers following the tragic deaths of John Hruby, our publisher, his wife, Tinker, and their daughter, Katherine,' said John's colleagues in a statement. 'Our staff endeavors to continue to serve Marlow to the best of our ability going forward.' Meanwhile, friends and classmates of Katherine, 17, a volleyball player, held a vigil for her last night. 'She was such a good person and such good friend to all of us,' said teammate Carly Kirkand. 'She always had a smile on her face even when she had every reason not to. It's going to be hard because she was such a huge part of this team.' Traveling: The youngster enjoyed trips to Paris, Rome, London and New York City is just the past year . Friends: 'They were a good family. They would always help you out. If your car wouldn't start, they'd come over and jump it, or if your dog ran off they'd try to help you catch it,' said a neighbor of Tinker (above) and her family . Fond recollections: 'She always had a smile on her face even when she had every reason not to,' said a friend who played high school volleyball with Katherine (above) Gone to soon: Katherine (above) was just 17-years-old and a junior in high school . Police are examining Alan Hruby's checkered criminal history, which includes a guilty sentence for credit card fraud and revealed that he is due in court again on November 12 for a parole violation. In a police affidavit filed in August, 2013 officers met with John Hruby after he suspected his son, Alan, was using a credit card not belonging to him. According to KFOR, authorities say they found several charges to the card from Europe, during the time Alan took a trip to Paris. He had previously ran afoul of the law earlier this year when he pleaded guilty to a charge of credit card theft. The credit card he stole belonged to his grandmother, Janice Hruby, according to a family friend. His father phoned the police and he pleaded guilty in January of this year and he was entered into a delayed sentencing program and was due to appear in court this November. As part of his punishment the court ordered him to pay restitution, undergo a substance abuse evaluation, attend drug and alcohol counseling and complete a cognitive behavior program.","John Hruby, his wife Katherine and their teenage daughter Katherine were found murdered in their home on Monday morning by their housekeeper .

"Back in July, Ronald Koeman tweeted a photo of training at Southampton. There were cones meticulously laid out, a pristine grass pitch and footballs at the ready. Just one thing was missing: players. It seemed like a caustic comment on the state of affairs he had inherited at the club. At that time £170million worth of talent was being sold; no one had come in. It didn’t bode terribly well. ‘I didn’t mean it that way!’ insists the Southampton manager, now linked with Barcelona and facing his one-time mentor and former friend Louis van Gaal at Manchester United. ‘It was not a message that we don’t have players. Other people took that decision to say that. If it was a joke, I would be the first to say it was a joke but it wasn’t. Seriously.’ Ronald Koeman has exceeded expectations after arriving as Southampton manager . Koeman will face his former friend and mentor Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford on Sunday . While it is undoubtedly true that all around sensed chaos and crisis at Southampton, he had sufficient self-belief to convince onlookers that the club could have a good season, though he does have the good grace to admit he is surprised to be in a Champions League spot with more than half the season gone . ‘No, I didn’t expect this,’ he concedes. ‘In that time, players were a little bit afraid about the situation but that’s normal. Because if you are like Jose Fonte, you are the captain of the team and you see four, five or six players out of the dressing room, signing for other clubs, of course you have reasons to be afraid. ‘My job was to calm that and to talk to the players and to give them the confidence that when we start the season, we will have a good team to continue what they did last season.’ Adam Lallana was one of several high profile players to leave St Mary's in a £170m exodus . Southampton currently sit fourth in the Premier League table following victory against Arsenal . Their progress since then has been stunning. Only Manchester City and Chelsea had scored more goals prior to this weekend’s games and they have the best defensive record, with just 15 goals conceded. Van Gaal, Arsene Wenger, Brendan Rodgers and Roberto Martinez would all crave a record like that. In the circumstances perhaps it’s no surprise that Koeman gives short shrift to those managers who say they need time to adapt to new circumstances. ‘It’s an easy answer as a manager to say, “I need time”. You don’t have time in football. I think sometimes they are more excuses of the people than to expect something.’ (L-R) Juan Mata, Robin van Persie and Victor Valdes train ahead of the visit of Southampton . Mangers like Louis van Gaal who need more time are just making excuses, according to Koeman . Easy to say, of course, when you win 11 of your first 14 games in the Premier League; not so easy for Van Gaal, who won three of his first 11 and has spent much of the first half of the season saying that it will take time for players to adapt to his ideas. ‘Maybe he is different to other managers but I don’t believe in football that you need two years or one year. It’s all about qualities of the players. And the better the players, the easier it is for the manager.’ Once friends, Koeman and Van Gaal fell out while working at Ajax together. Now Koeman hopes to upset the older man again by guiding his Saints into the Champions League. He says: ‘Games like Man United are good tests to see if the players believe in the qualities of the team and if we can reach that kind of position in the table.’","Southampton travel to Manchester United for a Premier League clash .

"Two sisters were sent home from school because they were wearing badges to raise awareness of Marie Curie Cancer Care, the charity which has helped their terminally ill grandfather. Elise Casey, 13, was sent home with a note saying she had been excluded from school for the day, and warning her mother that she could receive a fixed penalty notice for her daughter's absence. The teenager's sister Keira, 12, was also sent home from the school in Sheffield because she was also wearing the charity's daffodil badge. Elise Casey, 13 (left) and her younger sister Keira, 12, were sent home for wearing the Marie Curie daffodils . They had been wearing them in support of their granddad, David Paggiosi, 69, who was diagnosed with rare bile duct cancer that spread to his abdomen and is now inoperable. Their mother Gina, 42, said: 'It upset my dad because he knew they were doing it to support him. They were distraught and are finding it hard to come to terms with what is happening to their granddad. The housekeeper supervisior, who works at a care home, added: 'The girls had comments from teachers the week before and one teacher made the youngest take the badge off. 'They were sent straight home from school last Monday after being excluded for a day. The school rang me and I went home to find them sitting on the doorstep as they didn't have a house key. The girls were excluded for a day after they refused to remove the badges, worn in support of their grandfather . Gina Casey said she had encouraged her daughters to return to school with the badges despite the incident . 'They walked a mile from the school, through country lanes, which I wasn't happy about. 'The school haven't been in touch since. There has been no contact. They have not tried to speak to me at all.' Ms Casey said she is still encouraging her daughters to wear their badges in support of their grandfather as well as the charity. The pair returned to Outwood Academy City, in Sheffield, the next day with their badges pinned to their school uniform. Outwood Academy sent the girls' mother a letter informing her they had been excluded for wearing the badges . The school said it had a strict policy on wearing badges, bit these could be fixed to pupils' coats and bags . In a letter sent to their parents on October 20 by the acting principle, the school said: 'I am writing to . inform you of my decision to exclude Elise Casey for a fixed period of 1 day(s). This means that they will not be allowed in the Academy for this period. 'I realise that this exclusion may well be upsetting for you and your family, but the decision to exclude Elise has not been taken lightly. Bile duct cancer is a rare form of the disease, and can occur in the ducts inside or outside of the liver . There are around 1,000 new cases diagnosed every year . It occurs in the ducts which carry bile - the substance responsible for helping break down fats so they can be digested . The cause of bile cancer is unknown but factors such as infection, chronic inflammatory bowel conditions and age can increase the likelihood of it developing . Symptoms include dark urine, itchy skin and the eyes and skin becoming yellow (jaundice) It can also cause weight loss, abdomen pain and a high temperature or fever . The main treatment for bile duct cancer is surgery . If the cancer is at an early stage this will involve removal of the bile ducts. If it is advanced the bile ducts, part of the stomach, part of the small bowel, the pancreas, gall bladder and the surrounding lymph nodes are all removed. This is called Whipple's Procedure and is major surgery. Elise has been excluded for this fixed period because she refused to follow a reasonable request from a senior member of staff. 'I must advise you that you may receive a penalty notice from the local authority if your child is resent in a public place without reasonable justification.' Their father, Mr Casey, 42, a steel fixer, added: 'The school is run like a prison anyway, they check the kids' bags at the gate every day. 'It seems to be a very strict regime. 'They really should have taken their circumstances into consideration - it wasnt like they were wearing One Direction badges, the daffodils are for a very, very good cause.' Staff at the school say it has strict rules about pupils wearing charity badges on their school uniforms - though they are allowed on bags, bag straps or outdoor coats. The former City School was taken over by Wakefield's Outwood Grange Academy Trust at the beginning of the year, the first secondary in the city to be run by a chain based outside the city. A Trust spokeswoman said: 'We have an excellent track record of supporting a wide range of charities and encourage students to take part in charitable events and activities. 'Our policy is to request students to wear charity badges on either the bags,bag straps or outdoor coats but not as part of their school uniform. 'The only exception to this is when students purchase a poppy in the weeks leading up to Remembrance Day.' Marie Curie Cancer Care provide nursing and care to people with terminal illnesses, supporting them in hospices and in their homes.","Elise Casey, 13 and  Keira, 12 went to school wearing Marie Curie daffodils .

"John F Kennedy Jr had a steamy relationship with Madonna who his mother Jackie Onassis hated because she posed as Marilyn Monroe on the cover of Life magazine, a new book has claimed. JFK Jr, who was once dubbed the sexiest man alive, reportedly began seeing the Material Girl star in 1988 following the breakdown of her marriage to actor Sean Penn. In his new book 'The Good Son: JFK Jr. and the Mother He Loved,' author Christopher Andersen tells how Madonna 'went after' JFK Jr, telling friends she believed an affair with him 'would be nothing less than “cosmic""'. Scroll down for video . Relationship: John F Kennedy Jr and Madonna, pictured here in 1996, had an affair following the breakdown of her marriage to actor Sean Penn, a new book has claimed . The book also quotes dancer Erika Belle, one of Madonna’s closest friends at the time, who claims JFK Jr was equally keen. She said: 'You could see it in his eyes that first time they met. 'John was totally in awe.' JFK Jr and Madonna would reportedly meet at a health club where they shared the same trainer and would occasionally jog around Central Park together in the early morning. While they managed to keep their relationship secret from the media, JFK Jr was not said to have been shy about introducing the singer to his mother. The book tells how he brought her to his mother's Central Park flat where she signed the guestbook 'Mrs. Sean Penn', as she was still legally married at the time. Disapproving: JFK Jr's mother Jackie Onassis is said to have been unimpressed by Madonna particularly as she had posed as Marilyn Monroe on the cover of Life magazine . Jackie was reportedly unimpressed with the singer partly due to her use of crucifixes and other Catholic images which had been deemed sacrilegious by the Vatican. But what is said to have upset her most of all was seeing a copy of  Life Magazine which featured Madonna on the cover dressed up as Marilyn Monroe - Monroe being one of several women who her husband had famously cheated on her with. Scandal: Monroe was one of several women who JFK famously cheated on Jackie Onassis with . Author Christopher Andersen writes: 'One unwelcome reminder of JFK’s torrid affair with Marilyn — the affair that most troubled Jackie — arrived on her doorstep in the form of another blond bombshell by the name of Madonna.' Another part of the excerpt published by the New York Daily News, highlights the steamy nature of their alleged affair. It reads: 'One day while he was staying with Billy Noonan in Hyannis Port, John phoned New York to check his messages. 'On the other end, a woman with a familiar voice was calling from Rome. “Kennedy,” she began, “I’m drunk and when I see you next I’m going to take your ...” The rest was decidedly X-rated, and after John played it for Noonan, his friend asked to hear it again. 'Unable to quite place the voice, Noonan begged John to tell him who it was. “Madonna,” John answered matter-of-factly. 'Noonan was speechless. “You are banging Madonna?” Noonan asked. “How do I not know this until now?” 'So what was it like sleeping with Madonna? “Let me tell you,” Kennedy replied, “she’s a sexual dynamo.”' The book tells how at the time JFK Jr was still dating steady girlfriend Christina Haag - who Jackie O wanted him to marry - but somehow managed to keep his relationship with Madonna secret from her. However Madonna's ex husband Sean Penn is said to have confronted JFK Junior over it when they met at a party in Robert De Niro’s honor at the Tribeca Grill. Madonna's ex husband Sean Penn is said to have confronted JFK Junior over the relationship when they met at a party in Robert De Niro’s honor at the Tribeca Grill . When JFK junior went to intorduce himself, Mr Penn, reported snarled: 'I know who you are. You owe me an apology.' According to the book JFK Jr then 'beat a hasty retreat' because he was aware of Penn's reputation for fighting. JFK Jr is known to have had relationships with a string of women including Sex and the City actor Sarah Jessica Parker, who he is said to have seen at the same time as Madonna. He died in 1999 in a plane crash along with his wife Carolyn Bessette, and her elder sister Lauren.","Couple began  relationship after her marriage to Sean Penn broke down .

"A backpack found by police searching for missing Alice Gross contained the trainers she was wearing when she went missing, it has been revealed. The bag contained a pair of Vans trainers detectives believe the 14-year-old had on when she left home in Hamwell in west London on the day of her disappearance. It also contained a change of underwear, her lunch box and the rubbish from her lunch, police said today. Scroll down for video .

Police believe she may have taken another pair of shoes with her or bought some new ones at a nearby shopping centre she walked to. No money or purse was found. But he also said the bag had been disturbed by two builders working nearby before being returned to where they found it, and it was possible other people had rifled it and moved it and its contents as well.

'I need to know if anyone found Alice's bag before the builders and was anything taken from it, or if anyone has her iPhone,' Mr Chalmers added. 'Did you find or see a white iPhone 4s with a cracked rear case, that Alice had decorated with marker pen? If you did do you still have it?

"The Kremlin today denied reports from an American newspaper that Vladimir Putin maybe suffering from pancreatic cancer.

Peskov had been asked to comment on the reports from The New York Post last week, which spread to other media.

Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has complimented McNair following his recent performances . McNair will miss Northern Ireland's qualifiers with the Faroe Islands and Greece . Prior to the news of McNair's injury Irish boss Michael O’Neill said last week that he would resist the temptation to call up the teenager, who has represented his country at Under-17, Under-19 and Under-21 levels. ‘I want to make sure that when we bring Paddy in it’s right for Paddy as much as it’s right for us,’ said O’Neill. ‘He has played one game for United which is fantastic, but it’s a big jump and we have enough quality in defence at the moment.’ Northern Ireland defender Jonny Evans will also be absent from Michael O'Neill's Euro 2016 qualifiers . McNair impressed again in United’s 2-1 win over Everton on Sunday when he came up against £28million striker Romelu Lukaku. United boss Louis van Gaal had already warned his senior defenders that they face a battle to dislodge McNair when they are fit again. ‘I have to select them, do you understand?’ said Van Gaal. ‘Paddy McNair is doing great in my opinion.

"At 35, Tim Cahill is still scoring goals for fun, whether it be for club, country... or into a basketball hoop from long distance. The Australian forward has recently returned from a successful Asian Cup campaign, in which he helped his country lift the trophy on home turf, and is now preparing to begin his Chinese Super League career with Shanghai Shenhua. Taking some time out away from the pitch, former Everton star Cahill took part in Weet-Bix's 'Trick Shot Challenge', tasked with kicking a football into a basketball hoop from various distances. Tim Cahill took some time out to take part in Weet-Bix's 'Trick Shot Challenge' on the basketball court . Starting at the free-throw line, Cahill moved further and further back on the court, kicking into the hoop . Beginning at the free-throw line, a relatively short distance from the hoop, the aim of the game is the gradually move further away, netting from four separate lines. Cahill achieves the first goal, before moving back and netting from the three-point line, the mid-court line and finally the three-quarter line. The video, which skips through his attempts to just show the successful kicks, times Cahill's challenge at 19 minutes and five seconds. The end of the clip challenges the viewer to give it a go themselves, tweeting #TC4weetbixtrickshots with their result... how many can you do?

"Controversial: 43 NGO workers have been jailed in Egypt under president Mohammed Morsi, pictured . More than a dozen American aid workers have been sentenced to prison in Egypt after a court convicted them of stirring up unrest in the country. At least 16 Americans were among the 43 NGO workers who were today found guilty of illegally using foreign funds and given jail sentences of up to five years. Most of the Americans left Egypt last year, and are extremely unlikely to serve any prison time. The convicted aid workers include Sam LaHood, son of the U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, who was sentenced in absentia to five years in prison. The court in Cairo also issued judgements against the U.S. non-profit groups where the defendants worked, including the International Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute and Freedom House. The organisations have had their Egyptian offices closed and their assets in the country seized. 27 of the 43 defendants received five-year jail terms, with the others being given sentences of one or two years. Chaos: The case dates back to the downfall of Hosni Mubarak during Egypt revolution in 2011 . The controversial case, which has angered U.S. officials and threatened American aid to Egypt, began early last year. It had its origins in the period of military rule which followed the downfall of long-serving dictator Hosni Mubarak. Egypt and the United States have been close allies for more than three decades, with the Egyptian military receiving more than $1billion in aid annually. The aid is linked to a 1979 peace treaty with Israel, Washington's closest Middle East ally. Besides $1.3billion in U.S. military aid, Egypt also receives about $250million in economic aid every year. Allies: But the case, coming 10 days after this meeting between Mr Morsi and John Kerry, threatens to undermine relations between Egypt and the U.S. Relations between the two countries have long been affected by Egypt's treatment of non-profit groups, which insist they are purely charitable and do not have political aims. Last week, Human Rights Watch and 40 Egyptian rights groups claimed a law regulating non-governmental organisations would restrict the funding and operation of independent groups. The contentious bill, proposed by Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, would allow the state to control nonprofits' activities as well as their domestic and international funding, according to HRW. Step backwards? The move has been compared to the rule of long-serving dictator Hosni Mubarak . In a joint statement, the 40 rights groups accused Mr Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood and its political arm of seeking to curb the freedom of NGOs through legal restrictions. They said the proposed law could give Egypt's security apparatus the power to suppress rights group, drawing parallels to Mubarak's three decades of repression. They also expressed fears foreign non-profits would be treated with hostility and that vaguely worded legislation would hinder their operations.","43 aid workers given jail sentences for 'stirring up unrest' in Egypt .

"Scientists have created a ‘revolutionary’ vaccine that can protect against lethal strains of malaria and save hundreds of thousands of lives year. The vaccine, been developed from Tanzanian children naturally resistant to the disease, works by imprisoning the Malaria-causing parasites inside the red blood cells they infect. The researchers said that an experimental vaccine based on this idea protected mice in five trials and will be tested on lab monkeys beginning in the next four to six weeks. Scientists at Rhode Island Hospital created a trial vaccine using an antibody that imprisons the Malaria-causing parasites inside the blood cells they infect. Pictured here is a malaria-infected red blood cell . Dr Jonathan Kurtis, director of Rhode Island Hospital's Center for International Health Research, said if the monkey trials go well, a trial testing the vaccine in a small group of people could begin within a year and a half. Malaria is thought to kill around 627,000 people each year with as many as one child a minute dying Africa. Many of the children who survive the infection go on to have serious health problems later in life. Using blood samples and epidemiological data collected from hundreds of children in Tanzania, where malaria is endemic, by Dr Patrick Duffy and Dr Michal Fried of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the researchers pinpointed a protein. The researchers said that an experimental vaccine based on this idea protected mice in five trials and will be tested on lab monkeys beginning in the next four to six weeks . Named PfSEA-1, the parasites need this protein in order to escape from inside red blood cells they infect as they cause malaria. The researchers then found that antibodies sent by the body's immune system to take action against this protein managed to trap the parasites inside the red blood cells, blocking the progression of the disease. Using blood samples from hundreds of children in Tanzania, where malaria is . endemic, scientists pinpointed a protein called PfSEA-1. The parasites need this protein in order to escape from inside red blood cells they infect as they cause malaria. Scientists found that an antibody produced by the immune children hits the malaria parasite at a critical stage in its life-cycle by taking action against this protein. This traps the tiny organism in red blood cells, preventing it from getting out of the cell and spreading throughout the body. Tests, carried out in groups of mice, suggest this antibody could act as a potential vaccine. Scientists have struggled for years to create an effective vaccine against malaria, a mosquito-borne disease that affects mostly children in sub-Saharan Africa. ‘It's profoundly important to develop an effective malaria vaccine,’ said Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, calling the study ‘a novel and different type of an approach toward a vaccine.’ ‘Since the malaria parasite has such a complex replication cycle, there are multiple points in that replication cycle that are vulnerable to interference by an antibody or some response that can be induced by a vaccine,’ Dr Fauci said. Microscopic malaria parasites are carried in the saliva of female mosquitoes and enter a person's bloodstream through the insect's bite. The parasites pass through the liver and infect red blood cells. They replicate wildly in these cells and cause them to rupture, flooding the body with more and more parasites. Two existing approaches to vaccine development have sought to block the parasites from entering the liver or red blood cells. The antibody was found in a group of children in Tanzania who are naturally immune to malaria. Injecting a form of it into mice protected the creatures against the disease (stock image used) The new approach instead tries to bottle them up inside the red blood cells - or, as Dr Kurtis put it, ‘trap them inside a burning house.’ If the parasites remain trapped, they can be harmlessly eaten up in the spleen by immune system cells called macrophages, Dr Kurtis said. The researchers developed a vaccine that targeted PfSEA-1 and tried it on mice. In five experiments, vaccinated mice that were exposed to malaria had parasite levels four times lower than unvaccinated mice and survived twice as long afterward. The researchers then looked at blood samples from some of the Tanzanian children. Roughly one in 20 had naturally occurring levels of the antibodies that target PfSEA-1, and among these children there were no cases of severe malaria. The researchers also examined blood samples from 138 boys and men from a malaria-endemic area of Kenya. Those with detectable levels of naturally occurring antibodies to PfSEA-1 had 50 per cent lower parasite levels than those who did not. Dr Kurtis expressed hope about the prospects of a vaccine targeting this protein, but said the best future vaccine likely would combine this approach with others to attack the parasite on several fronts. He noted that there is currently no licensed vaccine for human parasitic infection.

"Owners of the new iPhone 6 Plus have been left angered as it emerged the phone can bend out of shape simply when stored in a pocket. Since the new model launched on Friday, a small but growing number of iPhone 6 Plus owners have reported the issue that significantly alters the appearance of the phone. The problem, dubbed 'bend gate' by some on social media sites, is due to the phone's thin aluminium exterior - but can be solved by ensuring the middle of the phone is not subjected to a large force. Scroll down for video . Since the iPhone 6 Plus (pictured) launched on Friday, reports have emerged that 'a small but growing number' of owners are claiming the frame bends if the device is left in pockets for an extended period of time. Others took to social media, facetiously thanking Apple for the 'flexible display' on their new gadget . It is believed the thinner  model, in addition to the use of aluminium metal in its design, causes the phone to deform. A video, uploaded to YouTube by user Lewis Hilsenteger, shows the iPhone 6 Plus bending using just his fingers. It has already been viewed more than 13.8 million times. MacRumors detailed on Tuesday that 'a small but growing number of iPhone 6 Plus owners have reportedly bent their phones after carrying the devices in their pockets just days after launch'. One forum user known as 'hanzoh' claimed his iPhone 6 plus was 'slightly bent' after he drove with the device in his pocket. 'The 6 Plus was about 18 hours in my pocket while sitting mostly,' Hanzoh said. 'As I lay it on the coffee table and sat down on the couch to relax from the drive, I saw the reflection of the window in the iPhones slightly distorted.' And he said when laid flat, a bend in the phones display can clearly be seen. The reason for the bend is due to the iPhone 6 Plus being made out of aluminium. Aluminium is a relatively soft metal and is fairly ductile and flexible so, if enough pressure is applied, it will bend and move. According to iMore, no part of either of the new iPhones has more than a quarter of an inch (0.64cm) of aluminium in any spot. This means that, in areas of the phones that are weakest, it’s possible it could be susceptible to bending. This is noticeable in images, with many of the bends occurring near the volume buttons and the SIM card slot. These areas have segments of the shell cut out to make room for the buttons and SIM card, so there is less aluminium - and they are more likely to bend. To stop the phone bending, users need to ensure that they do not put increased pressure on the middle of the phone. For example, do not have it sideways in a pocket, as your pocket will push it against your leg, possibly causing bending. Putting it in your back pocket could also have a similar effect, so storing it in a shirt pocket or bag might be a better option. Another option would be to make sure you have a case for the phone so that it can maintain its rigidity even when pressure is applied. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) announced on Monday the firm sold over 10 million of its 'bigger than bigger' models, setting a new three-day sales record. It beat the iPhone 5S and 5C's record of 9 million . It . has been reported that the thinner design of the 5.5-inch phone and the use of aluminum on . the frame will cause the new iPhone 6 Plus (pictured) to bend if pressure is applied . Hanzoh questioned whether the new 5.5-inch design was 'too thin'. The bendy feature of the new iPhone (pictured) has been met with wide criticism on social media . The bendy feature of the new iPhone has also been met with wide criticism on social media. Others hashtagged 'bendgate' as they poked fun at the defect. One user wrote: '@tim_cook hi Tim, I absolutely love my new iPhone 6 Plus!! My favorite feature is the flexible display.' However this isn't the first time iPhone frames have warped while the issue isn't unique to Apple, Mashable reports. It was further mentioned the thinner design and the use of aluminum on the frame causes the phone to misshape if pressure is applied. However, other Twitter users flagged up the fact that many handsets will bend under a similar amount of pressure. App developer ‏@drbarnard said: 'It’s actually impressive that the 6 Plus doesn’t break. Seems like that much pressure on any device would do damage.' While TechCrunch co-editor @panzer added: 'Just an anecdote: I carried around the iPhone 6 Plus for 5 days in a pocket at Disneyland on rides & coasters and did not bend it.' The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen, while the iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch display. Both models also include the Apple-designed A8 chip with second generation 64-bit desktop-class architecture, said to boost performance and power efficiency. They also have advanced iSight and FaceTime HD cameras, and users in the US will also be able to use the devices to pay for goods using Apple Pay. Besides larger screens, the new phones offer faster performance and a wireless chip for making credit card payments. In the US, the iPhone 6 starts at $199 for 32GB on a two-year contact, $299 for 64GB and $399 for 128GB. A SIM-only handset starts at £539 in the UK. The iPhone 6 Plus costs $299 on a two-year contract for 16GB, $399 for 64GB, $499 for 128GB. Unlocked, the handset starts at £619 in the UK. This isn't the first time iPhone frames have bent or warped (pictured), and the issue isn't unique to Apple. Reports in 2012 claimed that the iPhone 5 had similar frame weaknesses. The iPhone 5S release was met with similar complaints. Samsung devices are also vulnerable, and the Galaxy S4 in particular was found to bend .

"Do you feel friskier come summer? If so, you aren't alone according to new research which revealed that infidelity peaks during June, July and August. The findings were part of a new study conducted by Bank of Italy research fellow Effrosyni Adamopoulou which investigated whether or not commonly held beliefs about infidelity were true. Among those debunked was the perception that beautiful people are more likely to be cheats - a claim, according to Adamopoulou, that isn't borne out by the evidence. Feeling frisky? According to new research, infidelity - among both sexes - peaks in the summer months . Adamopoulou came to her conclusions after combing through data sourced from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a rolling experiment following a sample group of young American adults. Begun in 1994, researchers periodically contact the sample group to question them about their approach to health, relationships and sex. Among the questions posed to the group is: 'During the time you and your current partner have had a sexual relationship, have you ever had any other sexual partners?', which forms the basis of Adamopoulou's findings. According to the most recent data (from 2008), 21.5 per cent of participants admitted to cheating on their partner, although that dropped to 12.9 per cent among those who were married. Risk factor: Travel provides more chances to cheat but couples with children are less likely to be unfaithful . Based on her studies, Adamopoulou concluded that while men and women were equally likely to cheat, the chance of infidelity was less among couples who had children or were religious. More surprising was her discovery that ethnic origin appears to play a part, with black men more likely to be unfaithful than white. By contrast, class, earning power and education were all found to have no impact on whether or not people cheat. Instead, the summer months offer the greatest risk for couples, thanks to increased opportunities for travel - and consequently, increased opportunities to cheat. 'Cheating is less likely to be detected when an individual chooses partners in different places,' she explained in her report, which was first published in journal Economic Letters, before adding: . 'There . does not seem to be any relationship between socioeconomic status and . infidelity. Earnings and education do not seem to have any . statistically significant effect [on infidelity].'","Research by Bank of Italy researcher Effrosyni Adamopoulou .

"Oscar Pistorius stood unmoved and expressionless in the dock as he was found guilty of manslaughter 19 months after shooting to death his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp through a closed bathroom door. He remained still as he was embraced by his uncles and sister Aimee. The 27-year-old is now set to discover if he faces prison time for committing culpable homicide, the South African equivalent of manslaughter. Oscar Pistorius stood unmoved as he was found guilty of manslaughter on Friday . Judge Thokozile Masipa delivered the verdict at the High Court in Pretoria . Aimee Pistorius (centre) sat unmoved as her brother Oscar was found guilty of the charge . Pistorius speaking with his uncle Arnold during the trial on Friday morning . He was cleared of the more serious premeditated and unplanned murder charges but faces between no and 15 years prison time. The contrast between this broken man and the inspirational athlete who soared to worldwide fame as he overcame extreme disability to compete on the biggest stage was stark. His career is in tatters. It is unlikely he will ever compete in a significant athletics meet again. His house and most of the millions he earned in lucrative sponsorship deals are gone, hundreds of thousands spent on his defence team for this trial. Since the death of Steenkamp on Valentine’s Day, 2013, the world has watched breathlessly as the unravelling of Pistorius’s life has been played out in the media and before a Pretoria courtroom. Steenkamp, a successful model who was just 29 when she was killed by a man she had been dating for three months is the only true victim of this crime. But Pistorius’s fall from grace has been sensational. Pistorius with Steenkamp at a sports awards ceremon in Johannesburg in November 2012 . The pair had been dated for three months before the incident took place on February 2013 . Born without fibulas, the outer of the bones that run between the knee and the ankle, Pistorius’s legs were amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old. His parents insisted he was allowed to go to a normal school and at Constantina Kloof Primary School he ran, swam, played rugby and football like all the children. He overcame further tragedy when his beloved mother Sheila died when he was 15 and was already boarding at Pretoria Boys School when he was thrust into the international spotlight at the Athens Paralympics in 2004. A brace wearing 17-year-old, he became the face of disability sport by breaking the 200m world record and winning gold. His natural charm and ease in front of the media was immediately apparent. He was an inspiration to amputees the world over because of the way he prevailed over disability, winning six Paralympic gold medals in his career so far and even competing against able bodied athletes. Pistorius transcended Paralympic sport, becoming the first amputee sprinter to compete at an Olympic Games in 2012. He advanced through the heats of the 400m and finished 8th of eight in the semi-final. Pistorius competing in the 200m T44 category as a 17-year-old at Athens 2004 .

A South African magazine voted him the country’s sexiest celebrity in 2012. Pistorius was also preoccupied by guns and speed, firing his weapon in a crowded restaurant and injuring his friend Kevin Lerena, a professional boxer.

In KP: The Autobiography, Pietersen says that he was 'often naive and sometimes stupid. I was no villain, though.'

VIDEO Pietersen blasts former England 'regime' Pietersen has also accused former coach Andy Flower and ECB chief Giles Clarke of wanting the England team to be 'like Boy Scouts'. He wrote that the England management wished to oversee a 'sweet bunch of eager Boy Scouts who never did anything wrong on or off the field. Keen young gentlemen. Always perpetrated. They wanted us to win in a certain way.' While admitting he didn't always tread wisely, the 34-year-old insists he was picked on by former coach Flower, whom he labelled 'f***ing horrendous' and a 'Mood Hoover'. Pietersen says he was made a 'scapegoat' as a distraction during England's travails. His reasons for this were that he 'had a little history', was 'big, boisterous and annoying' and left 'colourful footprints on the pristine white carpets'. Pietersen also insists that Flower distrusted individuals such as himself. 'Individuality reflected badly on Flower's reputation as a leader', he added. Despite this, England did pick some 'individuals', so Flower apparently decided he would have to 'come down hard on them' so he could 'retain some sort of power'. A lot of Pietersen's ire is reserved for wicketkeeper Matt Prior, whom he dubs 'the Big Cheese'. Pietersen (centre) and Matt Prior - whom he dubbed 'The Big Cheese' - at Edgbaston in 2012 .

In a chapter entitled Le Grand Fromage, the former batsman says he gave his erstwhile team-mate that moniker as he was 'a Dairylea triangle thinking he was Brie'. Pietersen says Prior's reign as vice-captain of England was one of terror and double standards. He also says the former keeper would scream at fielders for shelling catches, with Pietersen also accusing him of 'schoolyard bitching'. The pre-Ashes training camp was described as a shambles, while Prior was ridiculed for taking his own bike on a tour of New Zealand and 'grassing on a younger player for having a few drinks in India.' Pietersen also mocked Prior's cycling kit, saying he'd get into his Team Sky uniform 'looking like Clark Kent'. He wasn't the only South African-born batsman to have problems with Prior, apparently. The normally mild-mannered Jonathan Trott snapped at Prior and Graeme Swann after the bowler and keeper had given the batsman a rollicking for misfielding in Bangladesh in 2010. Trott blasted: 'Will you f*** off? Who the f*** do you think you are?' This was a regular occurrence in the 'clique-ridden' England dressing room under Flower, says Pietersen. However, he strenuously denies that he sent South African friends tactical information on how to get Andrew Strauss out in the Textgate storm which engulfed English cricket in 2012. The scandal started KP's downfall as an England player and, he says, was a direct consequence of Strauss 'obnoxiously' ignoring him after scoring a century. Pietersen denies he gave South Africa information on how to dismiss Andrew Strauss (right) in 2012 . Pietersen and Strauss celebrate the latter's century earlier that summer against West Indies at Trent Bridge . Pietersen alleges his former captain didn’t acknowledge him after he hit 149 during the second Test in South Africa two years ago. That led to a friend in the South African side BlackBerry Messaging the batsman asking what his captain’s problem was. However, Pietersen stresses he did not text anyone in the Proteas team but refused to come out in public and say it. ‘It suited the ECB to use the messages as evidence of my open rebellion against Straussy,' he says. Pietersen also moves to set the record straight on the term ‘doos’ – thought to be Afrikaans for ‘c***’. He wrote that the friend called Strauss a ‘doos’, meaning a ‘d***’ or ‘idiot’, sentiments the 34-year-old agreed with.

"Commons Speaker John Bercow has been criticised after it emerged he charged taxpayers £1,300 to attend an MP’s funeral. Mr Bercow was one of a host of MPs at the Manchester service for popular Labour backbencher Paul Goggins who collapsed and died while out running in January. He charged £239.10 for a return train journey to Manchester for him and two staff, plus £112.50 for a car from Parliament to Euston station and back the next day. Commons Speaker John Bercow has faced criticism after it emerged he charged almost £1,300 to attend the funeral of an MP in Manchester . Taxpayers also picked up the £500 tab for him to ‘travel around Manchester’ by car - as well as £364.28 for him and his two staff to stay at city centre hotel, the Park Inn by Radisson. The total bill was £1,290. The funeral expense revelation, exposed by the Sun today, is not the first time Mr Bercow has been criticised over his expense claims. Last year MailOnline revealed he had run up a £100,000 bill in just three years on a taxpayer-funded tour of Britain and the world. Details of the huge costs included jetting off to almost 20 countries, trips to have his portrait painted and an official car to take him just one mile up the road to tour the offices of the MPs' expenses watchdog. Former Labour MP Paul Goggins collapsed and died while out running in January . The revelations sparked a furious response from MPs. Details of the Speaker’s travel costs since the general in May 2010 were obtained by MailOnline under Freedom of Information laws. Total travel and accommodation bill comes to more than £96,000, including £16,000 for journeys in a chauffeur-driven car and flights for him and aides costing £63,000. The huge sums are on top of £9,200 claimed by Mr Bercow on expenses in the last three years as the MP for Buckingham. Mr Bercow was today accused of treating taxpayers with contempt over his lavish claims. Dia Chakravarty, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘This seems like an extraordinary bill for an overnight stay.’ Tory MP Rob Wilson told the Sun: ‘It is right that a Speaker should attend the funeral of a former MP. ‘That said, at first look, it seems extravagant to spend over £1,000 of taxpayers’ money.’ A spokeswoman for Mr Bercow said: ‘The Speaker, representing the House of Commons, attended a church service the evening before Mr Goggins’ funeral, as well as attending the funeral. ‘This was a mark of respect to Paul Goggins and to his family. The funeral was in Manchester, so travel costs from Westminster were incurred.’","Mr Bercow travelled from London to Manchester to represent Parliament .

"The bosses of Britain's three spy agencies who were supposedly 'grilled' by MPs agreed questions with them in advance, it has emerged. The revelation has led one Tory MP to dub the hearings two weeks ago 'a total pantomime'. MPs summoned the heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ to an historic public session of the secretive intelligence and security committee to discuss leaks by the whistleblower Edward Snowden. MI5's Andrew Parker, MI6's John Sawers and GCHQ's Iain Lobban before the committee on November 7, where they discussed leaks by the whistleblower Edward Snowden. They were fed questions in advance . The committee is usually held in private and the hearing, which was televised and an hour and a half long, was trumped as heralding a new era of transparency. But sources told the Sunday Times there was a row between the committee's nine members, who are all senior MPs and Lords, after they were told the chiefs would only appear on the condition that they were told questions beforehand. The row focuses on the secretive intelligence and security committee, which evades the rules that apply to most parts of government. Its nine members are nominated by the Prime Minister and serving government ministers are not allowed to be members. Members see highly classified material, hold most of their sessions in private and must sign the Official Secrets Act. It also has greater powers than normal government committees and can summon official advice to ministers or evidence from previous governments. The current members include former Labour cabinet member Hazel Blears, former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell and its chairman, former Conservative foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind (pictured above). It raises fears over whether the MPs had no choice but to follow a softer line of questioning instead of holding the spy chiefs to account. Committee chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind told the Sunday Times: 'We gave them the initial questions... We cannot suddenly put a question to an intelligence chief that they might only be able to answer by reference to secret material.' MI5's Andrew Parker, MI6's John Sawers and GCHQ's Iain Lobban appeared before the committee on November 7 after high-profile leaks by the whistleblower Edward Snowden were published in the Guardian newspaper. He released files detailing how the U.S. National Security Agency, with the help of British counterparts, routinely collate e-mails from ordinary people and tapped the phone of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel. In his first public speech since April, Mr Parker condemned the leaks and said they were 'the gift [terrorists] need to evade us and strike at will.' He added: 'Unfashionable as it might seem, that is why we must keep secrets secret, and why not doing so causes such harm.' Sir John Sawers also told the hearing: 'I am not sure that the journalists who are managing this very sensitive information are particularly well placed, actually, to make judgments [about its dangerousness]. 'What I can tell you is that the leaks from Snowden have been very damaging. They have put our operations at risk. It is clear that our adversaries are rubbing their hands with glee. Al-Qaeda is lapping it up.' GCHQ, whose headquarters in Cheltenham are pictured, has been in the news over eavesdropping claims . Before the hearing, however, chiefs agreed to devote only a third of the allotted time to Edward Snowden, the Sunday Times reported, and agreed the line of questioning in advance. There were criticisms after the hearing that it had not given any real answers and that the spy chiefs had simply refused to answer several questions - citing security concerns. Professor Anthony Glees, director for the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at Buckingham University, told the newspaper: 'Stage-managing is reminiscent of the old Soviet Union, everybody applauding themselves. That is not the impression they should be giving. They should not be about mutual self-congratulation. It should be about holding people to account.' An anonymous Tory MP also told the newspaper: 'Evidently the whole thing was a total pantomime'. A Cabinet Office spokesman told MailOnline: 'The session was not scripted. As is commonplace for Parliamentary Committees, the broad areas of questioning - although not every detailed question - is shared in advance in order that the witnesses can prepare themselves adequately whilst still allowing for an engaging and spontaneous exchange.'","Sunday Times reveals MPs agreed questions with MI5, MI6 and GCHQ .

Jamie Carragher believes Arsene Wenger chooses not to select Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil in a central position because the Frenchman 'doesn't trust' him to play there in big games. Ozil was criticised for another abject showing as the Gunners were downed by Jose Mourinho's Chelsea on Sunday as Arsene Wenger chose to play the German on the wing once again.

"He has dedicated his life to uncovering the mysteries of the universe and has unearthed some of the greatest scientific finds of our time by studying outer space. So it is perhaps fitting that Professor Stephen Hawking should want to spend his final moments drifting among the moon, stars and planets he has always been so fascinated by. The astrophysicist has revealed that he's been offered a trip into space aboard Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic - and far from being daunted by the prospect, he added that he would be quite happy if this was the way he died. Scroll down for video . Professor Stephen Hawking  would like to spend his final moments drifting among the moon, stars and planets . Hawking has said that he'd love to go into outer space and visit the moon at some point before he dies . Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, he said: 'I would love to go to the Moon, or to go into space. I was due to go into space with Virgin Galactic, courtesy of Richard Branson, but I fear the doctors won’t allow it. It would be a good way to go.' In fact, the astrophysicist reckons we should all start thinking about making the trip to space if the human race has any hope of surviving the next thousand years. He added: 'The human race faces great dangers. I don’t think it will survive another thousand years unless it spreads out into space, so that all its eggs are not in one basket, or on one planet.' Professor Hawking, 72, who is widely considered the most famous living scientist, was speaking ahead of the Starmus 2014 Festival, which brings together some of the most brilliant minds in astronomy. He will be speaking about quantum theory, and how this allows for the extraordinary idea of the existence of many possible universes. 'In a sense, they all exist together,' he said. 'Many of them are unsuitable for any form of life. Thus our presence selects the small subset compatible with our existence. This is called the Anthropic principle.' Professor Hawking, 72, was speaking ahead of the Starmus 2014 Festival, which brings together some of the most brilliant minds in astronomy . The festival will see Hawking joined by the likes of Richard Dawkins, Brian May, Nobel Prize winners Robert Wilson and Sir Harold Kroto, and astronauts Walt Cunningham and Charlie Duke from the Apollo 7 and Apollo 16 missions. With past speakers including Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, Starmus - which this year takes place in the Canary Islands between 22 and 28 September - has become one of the most important dates in the astronomy calender. But it's not all hard work. Hawking revealed that - with Brian May and Rick Wakeman among their numbers - the scientists would have plenty of time to kick back and relax with some live music in the Spanish sunshine. He said: 'The science community is dedicated and serious, but it can let its hair down, and enjoy itself. '[At Starmus] we will unwind by listening to rock music, and watching dance grounds. I like rock music. It is extreme, like Wagner of whom I’m also a fan.' Hawking, who has famously said that he finds women a 'complete mystery', also took the opportunity to express his concerns that there are still not enough girls choosing to follow a career in science. 'It worries me that there are few women in science, he said. 'The reasons are partly historical, but I don’t think they can entirely explain why fewer girls than boys take physics and mathematics at A-level. They are not seen as feminine subjects. 'To counter this, my daughter and I have written a series of science-based adventure stories for children, with a girl heroine, Annie, who explores the universe.' But Hawking added the he was 'encouraged' to note that there are increasing numbers of women in astrophysics. He said: 'We have coffee mornings every day for those in cosmology, astrophysics or theoretical physics. Although the majority are men, there are many more women than when I began research. We have weekly informal lunchtime seminars, almost half the speakers are women.' Richard Branson has invited Hawking to travel into space - but the scientist is afraid his doctors will not allow it . Professor Stephen Hawking  is widely considered to be the most famous living scientist . Brian May and Rick Wakemen will be two of the live music acts performing at the Starmus festival . Professor Hawking was diagnosed with ALS - a form of Motor Neurone Disease - shortly after his 21st birthday. But in spite of being wheelchair bound and dependent on a computerised voice system for communication he has become one of the world's most renowned physicists. The astrophysicist has published three best-selling books - including the well-known A Brief History Of Time - and has been awarded with a number of honorary degrees, medals, and a CBE in 1982. He has also made cameos in The Simpsons and Star Trek, as well as making time for his three children and three grandchildren. Astrophysicist Garik Israelin,  founder and director of the Starmus, said he couldn't quite believe it when Hawking agreed to speak at the festival and credits him with raising the profile of the event. 'People love Stephen Hawking, everyone knows him,' Mr Isralian said. 'He is a symbol of someone who can fight. Astronaut Neil Armstrong made a one of his very rare appearances at the first Starmus festival in 2011 . Moonwalker Buzz Aldrin is another famous astronaut to have spoken at the inaugural Starmus festival . But although Starmus will see some high-profile speakers take to the stage, Mr Israelian explained that amateur astronomers were at the heart of the festival. He said: 'There are no events like this where we can get amateurs and huge names all together. It’s important to remember that it's a festival not a conference. 'It’s just a big party where you learn. We have tried to combine pleasure with education and make sure everything is fun. We let people enjoy their time during the day and then they are invited to listen to four really high profile speakers each evening.' Professor Hawking agreed that this was the aim of Starmus and insisted that he will be directing his talks at an amateur audience. He said: 'I hope the non-specialist audience takes away the idea that the origin of the universe did not require the hand of God, but can be explained by the laws of science.' A Starmus book with a foreword by Stephen Hawking is being published in time for the festival. Richard Dawkins is sure to provide some interesting insights in the Canary Islands later this month .

"After the wettest winter on record, it might seem hard to believe. But many of us have been living through a drought for the last fortnight, weather experts revealed last night. Meteorologists in southern England recorded a 16-day stretch without a drop of rain, officially long enough to be classed as a drought. Much of the country has seen an unseasonably warm and dry March. Temperatures have soared to 20C (68F) on two consecutive weekends and there have been unbroken blue skies for most areas. Sunshine: It comes as much of Britain has experienced an unseasonably warm and dry March. Above, Tallulah Gibbard, three, runs among daffodils in Penwith, Cornwall . Playful: Meteorologists in southern England recorded a 16-day stretch without a drop of rain. Above, Sequoia Gibbard, 20 months, is pictured playing in the sun-lit field . The weather saw families streaming on . to beaches while others got out their barbecues. Plant centres said . their sales had ‘gone bananas’, as homeowners took advantage of the . weather to tidy up their bedraggled and windblown gardens. But that warm spell ended on Thursday night with downpours, and today and tomorrow will be much colder and more unsettled. Dr . Roger Brugge, meteorologist at the University of Reading, said a . drought is defined as 15 consecutive days with less than 0.2mm of rain. The . university’s weather systems recorded no rainfall at all for 16 days – . which the Met Office confirmed was representative of the wider picture . across South and South East England. Dr Brugge said it had been the longest spell without rain in March for seven years. Having fun: The weather saw families streaming on to beaches, while others brought out barbecues. But it eventually gave way to cold and rainy conditions on Thursday . ‘These . dry conditions have prevailed across a large part of England during the . past fortnight, due to the persistence of an area of high pressure . which has also made March much warmer than average so far,’ he said. ‘But . overnight on Thursday 3.5mm (0.14inches) of rain fell in Reading, and . more rainfall appears to be likely to fall, albeit mostly small amounts, . on and off at times on most days during the remainder of March. ‘So . far, 2014 has gone from one extreme to another, from the wettest winter . on record to a meteorological drought, although those who are still . drying out their front rooms could be forgiven for not noticing.’ Although . the 16-day dry period constitutes a meteorological drought, the . Environment Agency has not declared an official drought. To declare a drought, the Agency considers river flows, water supply and reservoir levels. Because . Britian has had such heavy rainfall this winter, groundwater levels are . very high and there are unlikely to be problems with water shortages . this year. Prediction: Saturday will be grey and gloomy. There will be a brief respite from the bad weather on Sunday and Monday, with showers still affecting parts of the country, before the 'unsettled conditions' begin . Warning: Despite the recent sunny conditions, a Met Office forecaster said most people will experience rain over the next seven days . This . weekend will be cooler than recent weekends, with the mercury unlikely . to rise above 12C (54F) and wintry showers forecast over high ground in . the North. Temperatures will even dip to a frosty -2C (28F) tomorrow . night. But forecasters . are hoping for a return to the better weather by next weekend.

"Read Pietersen's forthright views on Andy Flower and his team of 'Boy Scouts' I did not text South Africans ways to get Strauss out, says Pietersen . The day Trott told Prior to 'f*** off' Kevin Pietersen reserves some of the most stinging criticism in his autobiography for Matt Prior, and refers to him constantly as ‘Cheese’, as in ‘The Big Cheese’, a nickname Pietersen claims Prior called himself when he first broke into the England team. He also labels him ‘the schoolyard bully who is also the teacher’s pet.’ Pietersen accuses Prior - to whom he gave the 'Big Cheese' moniker because the keeper was 'a Dairylea triangle thinking he was Brie' - of being the main cause of resentment towards him in the England dressing room and says he does not know why Andy Flower made him vice-captain of the team, a role Pietersen clearly coveted.

Kevin Pietersen (left) and Matt Prior (right) celebrates England's Ashes triumph in 2011 . KP: The Autobiography is published by Sphere, priced £20 plus p&p. ‘It was a sad time,’ says Pietersen in the book about the time he fell out with Prior during the tour of New Zealand last year. ‘I had been friends with Cheese. Now he was slowly losing any sense of himself as he turned up the volume and made himself the main man of the dressing room. 'Our Cheese was out there, growing runny in the heat. A Dairylea triangle thinking he was Brie.’ Pietersen also reveals that coach Andy Flower organised a one-on-one meeting after the New Zealand tour refereed by psychologist Mark Bawden to thrash out their problems and it was there the batsman accused Prior of being a ‘classroom bully.’ ‘I said he wasn’t captaincy material or even vice-captaincy material,’ writes Pietersen of Prior. ‘I didn’t like the way he spoke about people behind their backs. How he belittled younger players. 'How he was always complaining about Duncan Fletcher, who was and is a friend of mine. Too often he is to me an empty vessel making a lot of noise.’ Pietersen also accuses Prior of being part of the dominant clique in the dressing toom along with Graeme Swann and Stuart Broad. ‘And although Jimmy Anderson ran with them he wasn’t in the same league because at heart Jimmy is the nicest bloke in the world.’ Pietersen celebrates taking the wicket of Michael Clarke at Adelaide in 2010 with Prior and Paul Collingwood . Pietersen jokes around alongside Alastair Cook and Prior in June 2012 . There was also trouble between Pietersen and Prior in India after his ‘reintegration’ in 2012 when, Pietersen writes, he summoned Prior to his room in Nagpur and complained to him about his behaviour towards younger England players on the field. ‘Being vice-captain seemed to go to his head,’ writes Pietersen of Prior after Stuart Broad had returned home injured. ‘Sad, especially when he isn’t really vice-captaincy material at all.’ Pietersen also ridiculed Prior for taking his own bike on the 2013 tour to New Zealand and mocked his cycling kit, saying he'd get into his Team Sky uniform 'looking like Clark Kent'.

"Help is at hand for Catholics in Milan who need to ward off evil at short notice. The diocese has set up an exorcist hotline to cope with growing demand for assistance in dealing with potential cases of demonic possession. People contacting the switchboard will be able to schedule a visit from one of a team of 12 priests on call to deal with emergency exorcisms. I came as soon as you called: In the 1973 film The Exorcist a mother enlists the help of priests when her 12-year-old daughter becomes possessed by a demon . Monsignor Angelo Mascheroni, who has been chief exorcist in Milan since 1995, said the service had been set up in response to increasing numbers of requests from worshippers, and added that the number of exorcists appointed in the diocese had doubled over the past 15 years. Rebellious: Monsignor Mascheroni said many calls were from parents frustrated by their teenagers' behaviour . The priest, who described how one exorcist was dealing with as many as 120 cases every day, said the switchboard is manned from Monday to Friday between 2.30pm and 5pm. 'People in need can call and will be able to find a priest in the same area who doesn't have to travel too far,' the Monsignor told Italy's Chiesa di Milano website. While for film fans the word exorcism conjures images of priests trying to drive a demon spirit from a levitating Linda Blair, Monsignor Mascheroni said that the most important role of the diocese's team was 'listening and consolation'. He added that, in his experience, instances of 'real diabolical phenomena' were rare, according to a report in The Independent. The Monsignor said many of the callers . were exasperated parents struggling to cope with a rebellious child . refusing to go to school or experimenting with drugs. 'In reality it’s not a demon, but when . they’re 18 years old young people don’t want to be told what to do,' he said. The Monsignor said psychiatric disorders were more likely to be to blame for truly unusual behaviour than possession. Possession: Monsignor Angelo Mascheroni said that instances of 'real diabolical phenomena' were very rare . The Catechism of the Catholic Church states: 'When the Church asks publicly and authoritatively in the name of Jesus Christ that a person or object be protected against the power of the Evil One and withdrawn from his dominion, it is called exorcism'. These days, Catholic officials regard genuine possession as an extremely rare phenomenon, with modern exorcisms more likely to involve offering prayers or counselling to a person deemed to be in need of spiritual help.","The hotline has been set up in Milan, Europe's biggest Roman Catholic diocese, to cope with growing demand for exorcisms .

"Supermarket giant Tesco has doubled the price of some items in its budget food range, just as shoppers turn to no-frills basics to save money after splurging over Christmas. The price of a tin of Everyday Value mushy peas went up to 25p in December - more than triple its previous 8p price tag - while other staples such as dried spaghetti and frozen chicken breasts have also gone up. The price hikes were highlighted as Tesco reported its biggest sales boost over the Christmas period in three years. Price rises: Tesco has bumped up the prices of many products in its budget Everyday Value range . Shoppers hoping to snap up bargains from Tesco's own brand range will find themselves paying more for a host of items, with low-fat cottage cheese up from 59p to 75p, Rich Tea biscuits up from 23p to 35p, and a pack of dried mixed fruit up from 64p to 98p. Everyday Value sausages, previously priced at £1, are now £1.50, while the price of tomato ketchup has almost doubled from 16p to 30p. James Foord, from mysupermarket.com, said: 'Prices change constantly, which is why we show the price history of every product on our site to allow customers to decide if they are getting a good price on a product. 'Recently we introduced Savvy Buys, which are products that are currently at least 30 per cent below the average price across the retailers, so customers can see instantly if they are getting a good deal.' Campaigner Sarah Willingham, from . LetsSaveSomeMoney.com, told Mail Online: 'Supermarkets can be very . clever. Tesco owns nearly 30 per cent of the market and they know that a . penny rise here and a penny rise there makes a huge difference to their . bottom line, but consumers might not notice it. 'The Everyday Value range has been a . great thing for them - and I will say, for the consumer as well - but . more people are in food poverty now than ever. 'Times are tough and now is not the time to penalise people who can't afford it. 'My message to consumers would be: shop around and don't be misled by loyalty - you won't be rewarded for it.' Hike: The rises have seen the price of a tin of mushy peas go up from 8p to 25p . No-frills: Tesco's own-brand tomato ketchup has also gone up in price, from 16p to 30p . The retailer has said it was forced to introduce the hikes as a result of rising commodity costs and food inflation, but insisted its Everyday Value range was still priced extremely competitively when compared to similar ranges at rival supermarkets. But the fact that the retailer put up most of the prices over November and December has led to suggestions Tesco did so to cash in on last-minute shoppers in the run up to Christmas, as well as those turning to own brand items in a bid to save money at the start of the new year. Guy Anker, from moneysavingexpert.com, said: 'Those who are most hard-up are likely to choose this range of goods, so any price rise to the value range is very disappointing.' Mr Anker urged consumers to 'do their research' before doing their grocery shopping, to ensure they were getting the best possible price. A Tesco spokeswoman said: 'At Tesco we're committed to offering our customers great quality products at great prices through our Everyday Value range, and in these difficult times for our customers we are working hard to keep the cost of food shopping down. 'While factors such as rising commodity costs and food inflation mean that some products have increased in price slightly over the past year, most of our Everyday Value products have stayed at the same low prices or are now even cheaper,' the spokeswoman added. Today Tesco revealed its best UK sales figures for three years as it posted a 1.8 per cent rise in like-for-like sales for the six weeks up to January 5. The figure, which does not include petrol sales, came in the wake of the group's first fall in profits for 18 years, after Tesco recorded an 11.6 per cent drop to £1.66billion for the six months to September last year.

"David Cameron’s local hunt yesterday became the first to be convicted of illegally killing foxes. The Heythrop Hunt, which the Prime Minister has ridden with, was fined £4,000 after it admitted four offences under laws introduced in 2005. All previous prosecutions have been against named individuals. And yesterday Heythrop huntsman Julian Barnfield and recently retired master Richard Sumner pleaded guilty to the same four charges. Scroll down for video . Members of David Cameron's local Heythrop hunt were today convicted of illegal fox hunting. Member Julian Barnfield, is pictured left today, and right, Richard Sumner . Cruelty: The footage which was shown in court shows a fox being killed by hounds during a hunt . However, a judge sitting at Oxford . Magistrates’ Court questioned whether the ‘staggering’ £330,000 the . RSPCA spent on bringing the case was money well spent. Outside court, Barnfield, 49, said he . had been unable to afford to fight the charges and accused the animal . charity of ‘playing politics’ by targeting a hunt in Mr Cameron’s Witney . constituency. The Prime Minister, who has promised a . free vote on hunting in the Commons, rode with the Heythrop six times . before the law changed. The hunt is popular with his fellow . members of the Chipping Norton Set – an influential group of MPs and . media professionals who live close to the Cotswolds market town. The Heythrop Hunt's Barnfield, right, and Sumner, left, who were fined today after pleading guilty to intentionally hunting a fox with dogs . Charlie Brooks, the husband of ex-News . International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, is a member, and Top Gear . presenter Jeremy Clarkson has allowed it to ride on his land. More than 230 people have been convicted of illegal fox hunting since it was outlawed by Labour almost eight years ago. The majority of hunts continue to meet by using trail hunting, usually with a hunt member dragging the scent of fox urine across fields and woodlands. Other hunts use an exemption that allows dogs to flush out quarry from woodland which can then be shot. Yesterday was the first time the RSPCA had enough evidence to bring a prosecution against an entire hunt, rather than just individuals. Graphic footage of foxes being . attacked, which was taken by anti-hunt group Protect Our Wild Animals, . was played to the court during yesterday’s hearing. Describing a hunt in February, . prosecutor Jeremy Carter-Manning, QC, said: ‘The hounds converge in to . semi-circles and the screaming reaches a crescendo. The hounds are . making a kill.’ The next clip showed the bloodied carcass of a fox clamped in the jaws of a hound, prompting gasps from a packed public gallery. Passing sentence, district judge Tim . Pattinson said: ‘Hunting of foxes provokes extremely strong feelings on . both sides of the argument ... Some people see the hunting of foxes as . cruel and immoral, others see it as an essential tradition, part of . countryside management, and say criminalising the activity is . inappropriate. ‘The coalition Government has indicated the possibility of a free vote in Parliament at some point in the future. ‘I must put all of these matters to one side. I must sentence fairly and in accordance with the law.’ The footage, pictured, showed evidence of 'prolonged and deliberate unlawful hunting,' said Mr Carter-Manning . Referring to the RSPCA costs for . mounting the prosecution, he said: ‘It is not for me to express an . opinion, I merely flag it up, but I do find it to be a quite staggering . figure.’ He said the costs for all five defendants were only £35,000. He fined 68-year-old Sumner £1,800 and . Barnfield £1,000 for the offences which occurred on November 23 and . November 30, 2011, and February 29 and March 7 this year. The hunt was told to pay £15,000 towards the RSPCA’s costs, Sumner £2,500 and Barnfield £2,000. Outside court, Barnfield said: ‘We conceded because the money wasn’t there to defend ourselves. ‘I would like to stand there and . defend it but there was no way it was possible. The fact a charitable . body can take on this political thing and spend so much money which . other people have given them for another thing, is stunning. ‘I just hope their donors question . what they are doing with their money. They could have picked on any . other hunt but they picked on Heythrop because we are in David Cameron’s . constituency. ‘They are trying to put pressure on him not to give a free vote like he said he would, to embarrass him in some way.’ David Cameron, left, and Charlie Brooks, right, have ridden with the Heythrop Hunt Limited previously . Speaking after the hearing, RSPCA . chief inspector Mike Butcher said: ‘The evidence in this case was . incontrovertible – it clearly showed hounds being encouraged to pursue a . fox. ‘This is illegal under the Hunting Act . and constitutes a wildlife crime.’ A spokesman for the RSPCA denied the . charity had targeted Heythrop and said it would prosecute illegal . behaviour wherever it found it. In their 2010 manifesto, the . Conservatives promised a free vote in the House of Commons on whether to . overturn the ban, but many doubt it will happen because Liberal . Democrats are opposed to the proposal. A growing number of younger female Tory MPs, nicknamed the ‘Blue Foxes’, are also said to be against any plans to lift the ban. VIDEO: GRAPHIC CONTENT.

"A woman who works for Fox Sports has called for a change in the NFL and sports media as a whole in light of how the Ray Rice incident has been handled. Katie Nolan, a digital correspondent who hosts web series No Filter, says in a new video that instead of boycotting the NFL for its delayed reaction to the football player's heinous actions, we should fight back. 'It's time for women to have a seat at the big boy table and not where their presence is a gimmick or a concept,' she says. 'Just a person who happens to have breasts offering their opinion on the sports they love and the topics they know.' Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Katie Nolan (pictured), a digital correspondent for Fox Sports, has called for a change in the NFL and sports media as a whole in light of how the Ray Rice incident has been handled . Shake-up: 'It’s time for women to have a seat at the big boy table and not where their presence is a gimmick or a concept,' she says . Katie begins the video by explaining how much of a football fan she is, and how it is hard for her to reconcile her passion for the sport with her recent disapproval of the NFL. 'All this Ray Rice stuff has put me in an uncomfortable position. How do I reconcile my values and beliefs with my love for a sport that has an ongoing issue with domestic violence?' she says. 'How do I support a commissioner who needed to SEE a video of a man punching a woman in the face in order to realize it's unacceptable?' Then she explains that a simple boycott would not be practical, since not enough fans would follow through for it to make a significant difference. She adds: 'More likely, a boycott would just remove the critical thinkers from the NFL conversation and leave the league to continue making billions of dollars with even less accountability.' Challenge: Katie's video has had 200,000 views. 'The truth is the NFL will never respect women and their opinions as long as the media it answers to doesn't. I'm ready when you are, Fox,' she says . Instead, Katie calls for a change in the sports media industry, so that women have more of a say in the decisions made and the conversations had. 'Women in sports television are allowed to read headlines, patrol sidelines, and generally facilitate conversation for their male colleagues,' she states. 'And, while the Stephen A Smiths, Mike Cairns, Dan Patricks and Keith Olbermanns of the world get to weigh in on the issues of the day, we just smile and throw to commercial. Contradiction: 'All this Ray Rice stuff has put me in an uncomfortable position. How do I reconcile my values and beliefs with my love for a sport that has an ongoing issue with domestic violence?' she says . 'It’s time for the conversation to change or at least those participating in the conversation.' The video, which was posted on Tuesday, has had nearly 200,000 views. Many people have taken to the comments section to voice their support and agreement. 'I've been an avid fan since 2006 and have a dream one day to be an NFL announcer, but after everything that has taken place over these past 6 months, I'm in total agreement,' wrote one person. Agreement: 'Until [Roger] Goodell [pictured] resigns or is fired, I refuse to watch another NFL game. It's a complete disgrace seeing how much of a monopoly this league truly is,' commented one person on the video . 'Until [Roger] Goodell resigns or is fired, I refuse to watch another NFL game this year. It's a complete disgrace seeing how much of a monopoly this league truly is... A statement must be made that this s*** won't be tolerated.' Katie concludes her video with a call for NFL fans to fight for change in the sports media industry. 'Because the truth is the NFL will never respect women and their opinions as long as the media it answers to doesn't,' she says. 'I'm ready when you are, Fox.'","Katie Nolan, the host of Fox Sports web series No Filter, says women have been unjustly left out of the Ray Rice conversation .

"Finally: A settlement has been reached over the $300 million estate of late heiress, Huguette Clark . The vicious battle over the $300 million estate of late copper heiress Huguette Clark has been settled out of court at the eleventh hour - leaving her faithful nurse with nothing. The 40-page settlement was signed moments before jury selection was to begin on Tuesday and the judge in Surrogate's Court in Lower Manhattan accepted the deal, ruling out a trial. Clark, who was the daughter of former . U.S. Senator William Clark, died aged 104 in May 2011 and 19 of her distant . relatives have been battling over the fortune ever since. Clark had written two wills in 2005 and the relatives claimed she was not lucid when she wrote the second, which cut them out. Today's settlement combines elements from the two contradictory wills. The family - many of whom Clark never even met - came out as the winners, receiving $34 million while her private nurse of 20 years, Hadassah Peri, was left with nothing. Peri, an immigrant from the Philippines who worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week for Clark as she lived in New York hospitals, had originally been given $30 million in Clark's final will. Peri had also been given $30 million in gifts throughout Clark's life. A separate deal ordered her to pay $5 million of these back to the estate after the attorney general's office deemed them excessive. However, the settlement stops Clark's relatives trying to get any more of these gifts, NBC reported. Cut out: Hadassah Peri worked as Clark's nurse for 20 years and was left $30 million in her final will - but the settlement says that she will now receive none of this and must return $5 million worth of gifts . The gifts included . multiple Manhattan apartments and a $1.2 million Stradivarius violin. Her primary doctor also received cash Christmas presents totaling $500,000, . among other gifts. Peri's attorney, Harvey Corn, read a statement after the settlement emerged, reading: 'The Peri family is very happy to . contribute to the settlement of the litigations involving Madame Clark . in the hope that it will allow Madame Clark to retain whatever privacy . that she has left. 'The Peri family was blessed to have met Madame Clark . and she will always be in their thoughts and prayers.' The relatives who were arguing for the money are the great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren of Huguette's father from his first marriage. They do not need to pay legal fees in the case as the estate will cover the $11.5 million cost. Family wealth: Clark hugs her father on a vacation in Connecticut in 1912. The relatives who argued for the fortune are the great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren of Huguette's father from his first marriage . The 40-page settlement that was accepted in Manhattan's Surrogate's Court on Tuesday combines elements from Huguette Clark's two wills from 2005 and includes: . $34.5 million for Clark's relatives - many of whom had never met the heiress . $11.5 million for the relatives' legal fees . $85 million home in Santa Barbara, California and Clark's art collection to be controlled by an arts foundation, the Bellosguardo Foundation, which was set up by the will . $4.5 million cash for the art foundation . $1.7 million doll collection for the art foundation . $3.5 million for Clark's goddaughter, Wanda Styka, who wrote to her throughout her life . $10 million for the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. $1 million for the Beth Israel Medical Center, where Clark lived for 20 years . $0 for Hadassah Peri, the private nurse who had originally been in line for $30 million. She must also pay back $5 million in gifts . $0 for Clark's attorney, Wallace Bock, and her accountant, Irving Kamsler, who had been in line for $500,000 . The settlement also sets up an arts foundation . that will control the Clark family's $85 million summer home in Santa Barbara, California - making it the will's largest beneficiary, as Clark had wished. But rather than being set up in California, as she had asked, the foundation will in fact be in New York. Seats are reserved for the . Santa Barbara community and Clark's relatives. Her attorney, Wallace Bock, and her accountant, Irving Kamsler, will also get nothing after originally receiving $500,000 in the will and will no longer be executors of her estate, which would have paid each around $3 million, NBC reported. A criminal investigation of Clark's finances found there was no reason to charge either with a crime but the deal does allow the family to sue the duo, who were suspended from their posts for allegedly wasting her assets, for malpractice. Others will receive the amount dictated by the final will, including Clark's doctor, Henry Singman, who will receive $100,000, her goddaughter, Wanda Styka, who will receive $3.5 million, and Clark's personal assistant, Chris Sattler, who will receive $500,000. Tuesday's settlement drew an appeal . from one group that was cut out of the negotiations, meaning it could . have to be redrawn, but by accepting it, the judge warded off an . eight-week trial. The first . will drawn up in 2005, when she was 98, left $5 million to her nurse and . the rest to her relatives. The second, more detailed will, drawn six . weeks later, cut out her relatives entirely. Estate: 19 fought for a share of Clark's lavish $300 million estate. Pictured, inside her Manhattan home . The relatives had said that . a coterie of hospital executives, medical professionals and Clark's . lawyer and accountant took advantage of their access to the secluded, . aged heiress to manipulate their way into her millions of dollars. But the beneficiaries had argued that Clark was simply a generous woman who wanted to help those who helped her. Clark's . father, U.S. Sen. William A. Clark, was one of the richest Americans of . the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He served as a senator from . Montana, where he initially made his fortune from copper mines. His . business empire later grew to include building a Western rail line and . establishing a Nevada railroad town called Las Vegas. The surrounding . Clark County is named for him. Settled: The settlement was accepted by a judge at Manhattan's Surrogate's Court on Tuesday . Clark owned lavish properties . from New York's Fifth Avenue to the California coast but opted to spend . her last 20 years in a Manhattan hospital. While she stayed at the hospital, her . three fabulous homes sat empty: the $100million Bellosguardo estate, a . $24million country house in Connecticut and a $100million co-op, the . largest apartment on Fifth Avenue overlooking Central Park. When she died two weeks shy of her 105th birthday the only people present at her burial were funeral home employees.","Huguette Clark died aged 104 in 2011 and left millions to philanthropic foundations, her nurse, her attorney and accountant in her final will .

"Australia's terror alert will remain at medium despite the United Kingdom increasing its assessment of risk from substantial to severe, the second-highest level. The alert level is regularly reviewed by authorities and would be increased to high 'if it were deemed that a terrorist attack is likely to occur,' Attorney-General George Brandis said in a statement on Saturday. Senator Brandis said the government was seriously concerned that about 60 Australians were fighting in Syria and Iraq and another 100 were believed to be involved. Scroll down for video . Australia's terror alert will remain at medium despite the United Kingdom increasing its assessment of risk from substantial to severe on Friday . 'We remain in close contact with the United Kingdom and other partners about the threat from terrorist groups active in Syria and Iraq, and from returning foreign fighters,' he said. The UK's terror level was on Friday boosted to severe but Home Secretary Theresa May said there wasn't any specific threat. 'This move by the United Kingdom indicates the significance of the threat posed by the Islamic State and other terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq,' Senator Brandis said. The government remains concerned that about 60 Australians are currently fighting in Syria and Iraq, including  Khaled Sharrouf (left) and Mohamed Elomar (right) and another 100 are believed to be involved . The medium terror alert means that a terrorist attack could occur. It's still safe to travel to the UK, Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said. 'So long as Australian people abide by any warnings or suggestions they have in place, they should be able to travel there quite safely,' he said. 'We will continue to monitor the situation and when there is a need to make a change we will. But at this stage we will take the advice and act when or if it becomes necessary.' British Prime Minister David Cameron said ISIS was more dangerous than the Taliban and al Qaeda because it was trying to set up its own 'terrorist state' Meanwhile British Prime Minister David Cameron, yesterday announced an increase of armed police to patrol Britain's streets to counter the threat posed by fanatics returning from Iraq and Syria. Critical - an attack is expected imminently . Severe - an attack is highly likely . Substantial - an attack is a strong possibility . Moderate - an attack is possible but not likely . Low - an attack is unlikely . He said that the return of hundreds of murderous extremists posed a greater threat to the country's security than Al Qaeda or the IRA ever did. The Home Secretary said the intelligence services now believe a terror attack in Britain is ‘highly likely’, although she stressed there was no information about any specific plot. ‘The increase in the threat level is related to developments in Syria and Iraq where terrorist groups are planning attacks against the West,’ Theresa May said. ‘Some of those plots are likely to involve foreign fighters who have travelled there from the UK and Europe to take part in those conflicts.’ British intelligence officers believe at least 500 British citizens have travelled to Syria and Iraq to wage jihad, of which about half have returned to this country.","Australia's terror alert level will remain at 'medium', meaning that a terrorist attack could occur .

"It might be a matter of opinion as to whether money is the root of all evil – but cash is definitely dirty. Scientists have discovered that the average banknote is home to 26,000 bacteria, which could be potentially harmful to our health. Despite two thirds of us believing that handling bank notes and coins is unhygienic, just one in five Europeans wash their hands after holding cash, according to new research. Definitely dirty: The average European bank note is home to 26,000 bacteria, which could be potentially harmful to our health. And despite the fact we know them to be filthy, only one in five Europeans wash their hands after handling them, according to a new study . A Europe-wide study of over 9,000 consumers from 12 countries highlighted how despite being ranked as more unhygienic than hand rails on public transport or nuts in a bar, Europeans are struggling to break the bad habit of not cleaning their hands after handling dirty cash. More germs can be found on a £1 coin than on a regularly cleaned toilet seat, but almost half of Britons admit to never washing their hands after handling money. Men are more likely to avoid cleaning their hands than women at 55 per cent. Around 40 per cent of females skip the hygienic step. A staggering 43 per cent of Britons think money is clean and we are the least likely to wash our hands, along with Denmark in Europe . People living in France and Hungary have . the biggest ‘say-do gap’ as they were among the most aware of how filthy . money can be, but also the more likely not to wash their hands. A . staggering 43 per cent of Britons think money is clean and we are the . least likely to wash our hands, along with Denmark, in Europe. Psychologist Donna Dawson explained that people find it hard to make negative associations with money because notes and coins are the biggest form of individual success that we have. ‘The reason for the often large gap in the survey between what we say and what we do is a lack of “connection”. We may recognise that money collects germs, but we do not connect disease or illness to the handling of money,’ she said. The MasterCard research also highlighted that four in 10 Europeans claim they will try to be more hygienic and think that contactless payment will help. Over half of respondents to the survey said they would prefer to use contactless payment instead of handling germ-ridden coins. Dr Jim O’Mahony, lecturer in biological sciences at the Cork Institute of Technology, Ireland, said that humans have long been aware of the link between money and hygiene. ‘From a historical perspective there have even been reports that villagers believed money was somehow responsible for plague epidemics in England, with villagers leaving money in water troughs filled with vinegar in order to decontaminate it. ‘Scientifically, there have been many studies in recent years which have proven beyond doubt that bank notes and coins carry bacteria and other microbes.’ Hygiene wash out: People living in France and Hungary had the biggest 'say-do gap' as they were among the most aware of how filthy money can be, but also the more likely not to wash their hands . A MasterCard study conducted with the . University of Oxford found that the average European banknote contains . 26,000 bacterial colonies and UK notes were among the dirtiest – along . with Denmark’s krone, Russia’s rouble and the Austrian euro. The study comes in within a week of the old £50 banknote being withdrawn and follows  the announcement that the UK will use plastic bank notes so that they are more durable and more hygienic. The Bank of England signed an agreement with Innovia Security in March to obtain polymers for its new £5 and £10 notes. The new notes will be more dirt-resistant than paper because they will be coated in a film so they can wiped clean, as well as being harder to fake because they contain features including a transparent window. Polymer notes were first adopted by Australia in 1988 and are now in use in more than 20 countries. The new £5 notes are expected to be rolled out in the UK in 2016 and will feature Winston Churchill, while the £10 note will follow a year later with Jane Austen.","Europe-wide MasterCard study found that two thirds of people think handling money is unhygienic but only 1 in 5 Europeans wash their hands .

"Britons could be more at risk of terrorism because plans to widen access to flight passenger records are tied up in Brussels red tape. Security chiefs are increasingly concerned about the growing wave of potential jihadists travelling to and from lawless Syria. But a directive obliging airlines to pass details of European passengers to the authorities has been blocked on human rights grounds. A directive obliging airlines to pass details of European passengers to the authorities has been blocked on human rights grounds . Last night, it emerged that the European Union’s anti-terror chief has told ministers that they must make better use of airline passenger data. In a leaked document, Gilles de Kerchove said foreign fighters travelling to Syria where they can undergo terrorist training poses a ‘major security threat’. His comments came after Britain’s top counter-terrorism officer warned that the country is under threat from ‘fly-drive’ terrorists. Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick, of the Met, said young men are flying to Turkey where they hire a car and drive across the Syrian border. She warned that a small number could fall under the spell of terrorists and return to Britain with deadly skills and motivation. Legislation to force airlines to pass on passenger details remains stuck in the labyrinthine corridors of Brussels bureaucracy. This is despite the practice being routine in many other parts of the world in changes implemented after the September 11 attacks. Met Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick has previously warned the teh country is under threat from 'fly-drive' terrorists who fly to Turkey where they hire a car and drive across the Syrian border . The Civil Liberties Committee of the European Parliament rejected the directive in April and its future remains unclear. The changes were first presented more than two years ago as an anti-terrorism measure to be applied for passengers flying in and out the European Union. It would see data including passenger name, address, phone number and payment details being passed to the security services. Supporters of the bill said it would help track terrorists, people traffickers and other serious criminals who regularly cross international borders. But critics raised privacy concerns and said police could store the information for up to five years, effectively leading to passenger profiling. Brussels watchers predict the Edward Snowden affair has further damaged the chances of getting the changes implemented. The National Security Agency contractor stole a huge cache of secrets which laid bare the scale of surveillance by his employer and other agencies, including GCHQ. The note from the office of EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator highlights how the number of fighters traveling to Syria is increasing. It specifically calls for better use of airline passenger information available to security officials to keep track of when and how rebels move to Syria. The note says Europe should co-operate more closely with Turkey and help it improve controls at borders and airports. ‘There are cases where individuals continue traveling back and forth,’ it said. Experts estimate there are up to 1,700 foreign fighters among rebel forces, including several hundred from Britain. This is a substantial increase from the figure of between 600 and 800 who were believed to be there just a few months ago. Belgian Interior Minister Joelle Milquet said: ‘We have to anticipate the returns, the ways to handle this, the prevention measures and especially the exchange of information on the travels.’ Last month, Andrew Parker, the head of MI5, said spies have seen ‘low hundreds of people’ travel to Syria and that some have returned to the UK.","Security chiefs are concerned about the growing wave of potential jihadists travelling to and from lawless Syria .

"Always popular: Anita Dobson, pictured on Strictly Come Dancing, is to join The Archers . A racy divorcee is about to hit leafy Ambridge. So when Jennifer, Lillian and the other ladies of The Archers get together at the Bull, there will be only one topic for gossip. What to do about the unexpected new arrival in the everyday story of country folk? For in a move which will astonish the programme’s fans, the new character, I can reveal, is to be played by the one-time queen of TV soaps, Anita Dobson. As Queen Vic landlady Angie Watts in EastEnders, Anita, 63, enthralled fans with her tempestuous marriage to unfaithful husband Dirty Den, played by Leslie Grantham. And in 1986 their storyline helped the show record the highest-ever viewing figures for a soap – more than 30 million. When she quit at the height of her fame in 1988, Anita vowed she would never again appear in a soap because of the public pressure she encountered. She has since starred in many TV dramas and on the stage, most recently in a Royal Shakespeare Company production of The Merry Wives Of Windsor. But now she has clearly had a change of mind. ‘I’m going into The Archers playing a divorcee called Celia,’ Anita says. Her arrival could be just the shot in the arm the radio show needs following recent complaints about storylines and political correctness. Last month the BBC said it was shutting down The Archers online messageboard after scores of complaints. Two years ago Anita appeared on Strictly Come Dancing where she proved to be an excellent dancer and last year, she was on tour with Greta Scacchi in the play Joan and Betty about Joan Crawford and Bette Davis fractious relationship when they made the film Whatever Happened To Baby Jane? Speaking of her new role at  St Pancras station where her  rock guitarist husband Brian May was giving a performance, Anita says: ‘Initially it’s just for six episodes. 'To be honest I’ve been working non-stop lately and what  I would like most is a long rest. But we’ll see.’ Says a friend: ‘The role is ideal for Anita, she plays a flighty woman on the look-out for a man and is just the kind of part she has been looking for to put some fun back into her career.’ Soap past: Anita Dobson pictured as Queen Vic landlady Angie Watts next to Leslie Grantham as 'Dirty' Den Watts on Eastenders . It was the sartorial go-to for fashionistas and celebrities alike including Elle Macpherson, TV presenter Lauren Laverne and American socialite Olivia Palermo. But now, glamorous founder Sarah Walter has been forced to put her company — Style-Passport — into liquidation. After only two years of trading, Sarah, who is the wife of GQ editor Dylan Jones and a contemporary of Anna Wintour — they began their careers at British Vogue on the same day — is facing losing her business after a key investor pulled out. Looking for love: June Sarpong has returned to the UK to find a husband as she prefers British men to Americans . Fans of the high-end bikinis and . kaftans sold by Sarah and her team have taken to social networking site . Twitter to express their shock at the news. However the online firm, . whose  administration is being overseen by liquidators Marsh Hammond . & Partners, has reassured customers that all existing orders will be . fulfilled. ‘Everyone is incredibly sad but there is still time for someone to come in with an investment and save the day,’ says a friend. ‘So we all just have to sit tight and wait and see.’ After four years in the U.S, bubbly TV presenter June Sarpong is returning to British shores, bringing with her some big plans. The first is to oversee the expansion of her international network Women: Inspiration and Enterprise, for which she is hosting a  symposium tomorrow. The second is of a more personal nature — to look for a husband. ‘Finding a guy is another reason to come home, I prefer British men,’ says June, 35. ‘They’re not chivalrous the way American men are but that’s OK, I would rather have British jokes and British sarcasm — and I can open my own door.’ June, who is in talks with Channel 4 about a new show, admits her job will take a backseat when she does start a family. ‘If you are a woman and you’re over 40, your TV career is not what is was ten years earlier, it’s nuts,’ she says. ‘There’s ageism, sexism, racism. ‘But hopefully I’ll be at home with kids so I am happy to relax and take a step back career-wise five years from now.’ It’s all smiles at Chilham Castle in Kent where former Tory donor turned UKIP treasurer Stuart Wheeler has been cheering the success of his party’s efforts in the by-election at Eastleigh. Now his wife, society photographer Tessa Codrington, has another reason to celebrate. For Tessa has finally managed to get the second edition of her coffee-table photographic book, Spirit Of Tangier, distributed after her publisher went bankrupt. Her book, first published in 2008, was a sell-out and it was re-printed five months ago. ‘But then there was this terrible blip,’ she tells me. ‘Just as all the books were about to be distributed, the publishing company went into liquidation. ‘They have now been taken over  by someone else — but at the time all the books were stuck in storage  and the distributer refused to send them out.’ This week, however, she hopes they will at last go on sale again. Emma Forbes has worked out why she’s not on prime-time TV any more. ‘I don’t suck up to male presenters enough,’ she says. ‘I think I’m too feisty. I just can’t simper to men like so many women I know on TV — it makes me sick.’ Happily Emma, 47, has other plans. Speaking at Tesco’s Mum Of The Year awards at the Savoy, the mother-of-two tells me: ‘I’ve just been signed up by Vision Express as a style adviser, which is a coincidence because my eyesight has suddenly got terrible. ‘I’ve got to wear spectacles to read autocues and I’m looking for a really outrageous pair!’ In a theatrical career spanning more than half a century, you might suppose that Dame Eileen Atkins has some regrets. In fact, she has just two. ‘One was a Jeffrey Archer play that was no fun at all,’ she says. ‘Poor Jeffrey, it wasn’t his fault but he was asked to re-write the whole thing. The other was a horror movie with Joan Collins. She was all right, but it was a dreadful movie.’ Dame Eileen, 78, adds: ‘It was called I Don’t Want To Be Born and it was a spin-off of The Exorcist. I needed cash to go half-way across the world to meet a man and thought, “Oh well it will be all right, I’ll just do this.” It was only two grand, too — two grand and I sold my soul...’","Anita Dobson will star as a racy divorcee in the popular BBC Radio 4 show .

"Pressure on Marks & Spencer boss Marc Bolland intensified today after the City punished the chain for a dismal performance in clothing this Christmas. M&S shares were 4 per cent lower after last night's disclosure that like-for-like sales fell by 1.8 per cent in the UK in the 13 weeks to December 29, including a bigger-than-expected slump in general merchandise of 3.8 per cent. Mr Bolland admitted that trading in non-food was not yet satisfactory but pointed out that the group had decided to protect margins by reducing the level of promotions and keeping more stock at full prices. He also said a new management team, which includes ex-Jaeger boss Belinda Earl, needed more time to address the turnaround plan, with their first collection for the autumn-winter season not due in the shops until July. 'Unsatisfactory': M&S chief executive Marc Bolland is under scrutiny after disappointing Christmas results . However, City analysts said time was running out for Mr Bolland to show signs of trading improvement in clothing, particularly given the amount of money being spent on improving the company's stores. Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said: 'It is clear that pressure is rising on the new management with respect to the nature and performance of forthcoming spring and summer clothing ranges at M&S in the UK, and an improvement in relative and absolute terms is necessary for shareholders' confidence to be bolstered.' Seymour Pierce said it planned to cut £10million from its forecast for profits in the year to April to £645million, a figure which compares with the £1billion-plus achieved by the chain in the 2008 financial year. The results come in contrast to other . retail giants Next and John Lewis, which reported strong sales growth . over the Christmas period. Under-performing: M&S has reported a 1.8 per cent drop in UK like-for-like sales over the festive period, including a 3.8 per cent drop in general merchandise sales . Mr Bolland, who took over as chief executive in 2010, said it had been a 'challenging and highly promotional' general merchandise market . But the group produced a better-than-expected performance in its food business, where sales were up 0.3 per cent on a like-for-like basis . It said its free next day store . collection initiative helped push online sales up 10.8 per cent in the . period, with sales from mobile phones and tablet computers up 90 per . cent. M&S cashed in on the Kate effect in September, as they saw one pair of £19.50 Duchess of Cambridge-style nude courts fly off the shelves every two minutes. The style became one of M&S’s best-selling shoe ever. Rosie . Huntington-Whiteley's lingerie line, launched in October, proved a . huge success, fast becoming the store's best-performing underwear range . of all time. The company said the line 'surpassed all sales . expectations'. The company also landed a new appointment in Belinda Earl, former chief executive of Jaeger, . Aquascutum and Debenhams, last year in a newly created part-time . role. She is expected to be tasked with a radical overhaul of the . clothing collections. Surpassed expectations: Model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley wearing her own lingerie range with M&S . M&S went hi-tech, with free wi-fi in stores and iPads to help store assistants help shoppers find what they need. Futuristic beauty halls, complete with virtual makeovers, have also been a huge hit in stores and online. Twiggy’s collections were a massive success – from a publicity point of view and as a device to win back the older shopper. Her £79 sequined jacket sold out in just two hours last April. The group said the launch of more than . 700 new products helped it achieve record sales of almost £330million . in the two key Christmas trading weeks. Older shoppers: Twiggy's popular fashion range was very successful at winning back customers . The group said it was cautious about the year ahead and it expected to see continued pressure on consumers' disposable incomes. Mr Bolland was forced to rush out the disappointing sales update late last night after details leaked out. Finance chief Alan Stewart was also . forced to defend his boss after he faced questions over whether his job . was at risk, saying: ‘I don’t think you can expect Marc to answer that. He has the full support of the board and shareholders.’ High Profile: Marc Bolland with model Rosie Huntington-Whitely. Belinda Earl (right), the former chief executive of Jaegar, was also recruited by Mr Bolland . The Dutchman defended his decision not to drop prices, saying: ‘We didn’t want to price promote ourselves this Christmas, but saw major retailers like Gap going into sale with up to 70 per cent off.’ He conceded: ‘Our clothing performance is not yet satisfactory, but we are confident that the steps being taken by the new management team will address this.’ Over Christmas the firm said party wear . had sold strongly and lingerie sales rose 36 per cent. A range designed . by model and actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley shifted more than 160,000 . pieces, while sales of accessories such as scarves were up 45 per cent. The great blonde hope, Kate Bostock, who was hired as clothing chief in 2004 thanks to triumphs with George Davies and Next, left last year 'by mutual consent' after sales were down 6.8 per cent. She has since joined online retailer asos.com. Carole Boyes-Weston, head of design for Per Una and Limited Collection womenswear brands, also left the company before Christmas after only five months in the job. 'Stock-buying blunders' and wet weather were blamed for a poor summer of clothing sales, while the February cold snap had shoppers looking for jumpers that were not there. M&S could have sold 300,00 items of knitwear, but it only had 100,000. Great blonde hope: Kate Bostock was hired in 2004 but left M&S last year by 'mutual consent' This was not the only buying error: It could have sold 17,000 of the sort of ballet pumps championed by the Middleton sisters, but it only had 10,000 in its shops. Failure to stock enough bestselling items represented £10 million in lost sales. M&S ditched celebrity models, including Myleene Klass and Dannii Minogue, for the first time in 12 years after A-list advertising failed to convert to sufficient sales. Big high street hitters, including Primark, Debenhams and Zara, were said to be grabbing M&S customers. Christodoulos Chaviaras at Barclays Capital said in November: 'In the last four years M&S only outperformed its peers in 2010. This underperformance will likely continue.' Ditched: Celebrity models like Myleene Klass have been dropped for the first time in 12 years . And there was good news in the food . division, with sales rising 0.3 per cent and record sales of nearly . £330million over the two key Christmas trading weeks. M&S . shifted a record 1.5million fresh turkeys, up 4 per cent on last year, . and sold 5 per cent more party food. Sales of chocolate boxes were up 8 . per cent. Last year M&S suffered problems when . stores ran out of stock of popular items and some shoppers complained . that its fashion lines were dull and unappealing. Slump: Clothing sales at Marks & Spencer fell over the vital period in the run-up to Christmas . Disappointing: The retailer blamed the fall in sales on others on the high street slashing their prices before Christmas . Bolland was born in Apeldoorn, Holland, and studied business administration and economics at Groningen University before joining Heineken as a graduate trainee. Over two decades he climbed the ranks to cemome chief operating officer and had a seat on the board of the brewer. He joined Morrisons as chief executive in June 2006 and transformed the supermarket giant's fortunes over three years, before joining M&S in 2009. M&S said its spring and summer ranges, which launched in stores this week, had been well received by the fashion press. It added: 'In a challenging and highly promotional general merchandise market, we delivered fewer but more targeted promotions, with a focus on full price sales. 'As a result we offered customers great value at M&S quality, whilst protecting our gross margin.'","Retailer saw a slump in clothing sales over the vital festive period .

"Ross McEwan, who only took over the State-backed bank in October, was quietly handed an astonishing £1.5million in free shares . Fury over bankers' pay erupted again last night after the new boss of RBS was quietly handed an astonishing £1.5million in free shares. Ross McEwan, who only took over the State-backed bank in October, was given the stock as compensation for missing out on bonuses at his previous employer. The announcement was made after markets closed for the New Year holiday, and was seemingly designed to attract minimum publicity. Mr McEwan's payout emerged as Goldman Sachs revealed 'obscene' pay deals worth more than £3 million each to 115 of its senior bankers. The bumper packages were disclosed as Archbishop Justin Welby said foreign-owned banks in the City of London were 'in denial' about their role in the financial crisis, and Barclays boss Antony Jenkins admitted it could take a decade for the sector to win back public trust. Deborah Hargreaves, of the High Pay Centre, said: 'When you look at the pay everyone else is getting, to see bankers on that kind of salary is just not justified.' She added: 'We live in a country where some people are being forced to go to food banks because they can't feed themselves, so it's obscene to see bankers being paid £3 million on average. It's an outrageous indictment of a civilised society.' New Zealand-born Mr McEwan, who is paid a basic salary of £1 million, was given 454,106 RBS shares when he joined the bank in 2012 as its head of UK retail to make up for leaving his job at Commonwealth Bank in Australia. In October, he became chief executive after Stephen Hester walked away from the role. The 454,106 shares were paid out to Mr McEwan yesterday, with a value of £1.53 million. RBS issued a statement confirming the figures only after the stock market had closed for the year. Mr McEwan immediately sold 214,019 of the shares to cover tax liabilities arising from the vesting, but will hold on to 240,087 shares, worth £816,775, which he will not be able to sell for six months. He is entitled to a further 1.05million shares – worth £3.5 million based on RBS's closing price yesterday of £3.38. They can't be vested until August 2015. An RBS spokesman said: 'Ross McEwan will not sell any shares in RBS while he is chief executive of the bank. He wants everyone to have confidence that his interests are 100 per cent aligned with our customers and our shareholders, including UK taxpayers.' (File picture) A man uses a cashpoint machine outside a branch of RBS in the City of London. The bank has given its boss stock as compensation for missing out on bonuses at his previous employer . Goldman, meanwhile, said 115 of its top staff around the world shared a cash pool worth £122 million, or more than £1 million each. But senior bankers are also entitled to a bonus paid in shares, which are awarded in three instalments and cannot be cashed in for five years. The shares are currently worth a combined £250 million, or £2.2 million for each recipient. Taken with the cash, this adds up to a payout of more than £3 million a head. Justin Welby, the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, says foreign banks are 'in denial' about their role in the financial crisis . Goldman Sachs (pictured here in Fleet Street, London) said 115 of its top staff around the world shared a cash pool worth £122million, or more than £1million each . Goldman employs 5,000 staff in London and 32,400 worldwide. The bank's role in the global crisis came under heavy scrutiny in 2010, when it was slapped with a £333 million fine by US regulators over claims that it misled investors. New rules limiting what banks in the European Union can pay in bonuses come into force today. They will be banned from paying bonuses worth more than a banker's annual salary, or twice as much as their pay if sanctioned by shareholders. But most banks are expected to raise basic pay in order to offset the decline. '[Ross McEwan] wants everyone to have confidence that . his interests are 100 per cent aligned with our customers and our . shareholders, including UK taxpayers.' RBS spokesman . Mr Welby, an Eton-educated former oil executive who sat on the influential Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, said many bankers did not understand how the industry's culture of high risk and reckless pursuit of profit had brought the global economy to its knees. 'I don't want to name names but I came across some people recently who were senior members of the City from foreign organisations, but who were very clearly still absolutely in denial about what happened in 2008,' he said. Mr Welby called on banks to think harder about their role in society. But he was forced to admit that the Church had yet to sell £80,000 worth of shares in Wonga, the controversial payday lender that has been attacked for charging sky-high interest rates. Mr Jenkins, speaking in his role as a guest editor of Radio 4's Today programme, said: 'Trust is a very easy thing to lose and a very hard thing to win back. In my view it will take several years – probably five to ten – to rebuild trust in Barclays.' Mr McEwan's first three months as chief executive have been beset by problems, including an IT failure that left 750,000 customers of RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank unable to use their credit and debit cards for hours. He branded the failure 'unacceptable' and vowed to 'do better'.","Ross McEwan only took over the State-backed bank in October .

"Enjoying the trip of a lifetime to Thailand, university student Isabelle Brennan strokes a young tiger at a popular tourist attraction – one of the few places in the world where you can pet the deadly animals while they sleep. But just minutes after this photo was taken, another 400lb tiger leapt into the frame, knocking the 19-year-old to the ground with its paw and sinking its teeth into her thigh. She was saved when keepers at the Tiger Temple sanctuary in West Thailand jumped between her and the animal, while her sister and travelling companion Georgie, 21, dragged her to safety. Calm before the storm: Isabelle Brennan, pictured stroking a tiger - she would later be attacked by one of the big cats . In hospital: Following the attack, Ms Brennan was told she would have scarring for life . Eight weeks on, Miss Brennan is recovering at home in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, but cannot walk unaided, while doctors said the four-inch wound will leave her scarred for life. The University College London student wants to warn others of the dangers of approaching the orphaned tigers, which are hand-reared by Buddhist monks at the controversial sanctuary. Reliving the nightmare she said last night: ‘I feel lucky to be alive. Everything happened so fast. One minute I was petting a tiger’s back, the next it turned its head and knocked me to the ground with its paw. ‘As it lunged with its teeth I felt an agonising pain on the inside of my left thigh above my knee. What happened next is a blur.  But a keeper jumped in between myself and the tiger. Then, while the keepers pulled the tiger to stop it attacking me further, my older sister Georgie dragged me under my arms to safety.’ Wound: Ms Brennan was bitten by a 400lb tiger . The stunned teenager added: ’When I looked down at my leg it was terrifying. All I could see was blood.’ Two friends in their group immediately tied a tourniquet round Miss Brennan’s leg to stop it bleeding. Meanwhile, the Human Sciences student who is studying for a degree at University College London was rushed to Thailand’s Kanchanaburi Memorial Hospital where she needed ‘tens of stitches’ to repair the four-inch wound. She then had to remain in hospital for a fortnight after contracting an infection and high fever.Her sister, 21, was forced to make the call to parents Margaret and Nick Brennan, 56, an architect. Mother Margaret Brennan, 52 a former nurse who now runs her own business, said: ‘When Georgie rang the first thing she said was ‘firstly Isabelle’s ok’ but I was very upset. I couldn’t believe it when she said Isabelle had been bitten by a tiger.’ But finally after a gruelling two weeks in hospital – when she was pumped with strong antiobotics - she was well enough to fly back to the UK. However, Miss Brennan was to spend a month in a wheelchair and on crutches. She is now learning how to walk again. Eight weeks since the attack, she is still limping and doctors have told her she will have a permanent scar. Miss Brennan and her sister from Harrogate were in the first week of their trip of a lifetime in Thailand, which they had spent six months saving for, when they visited Tiger Temple. ‘I was nervous about going into the Temple,’ says Miss Brennan, ‘however, I was reassured by the staff that as the tigers had been hand reared, they were so used to humans they were completely tame. Reminder of horror: The wound after being stitched . Struggling: Isabelle Brennan still cannot walk without help . ‘They were also tethered by chains and the staff told me no-one had ever been seriously injured.’After petting some tigers in an enclosure, Miss Brennan – who followed all the Temple rules such as not wearing bright clothes to excite the tigers - decided to go into a special area where she could wash the tigers. ‘We were given a talk beforehand and told not to touch the tiger’s head and to remove dangly jewellery. We were then shown how to wash a tiger’s back.’ It was while Miss Brennan was washing one tiger’s back, it turned round and mauled her. She says: ‘In hindsight I had an incredibly lucky escape. I could have lost my leg or worse. The Tiger Temple staff were very upset. They paid for all my treatment in hospital and visited every day. They explained the tiger was just being playful. However, I want to warn others going to Tiger Temple that the animals might not be as docile as they first appear.’","Isabelle Brennan was knocked to the ground and attacked at the Tiger Temple sanctuary .

"Men have long been maligned for their lack of hygiene but now they have no excuse for not washing their hands after a visit to the bathroom. A Latvian designer has come up with a novel toilet design to improve men's hand washing habits by by including a built-in tap. Kaspars Jursons' design is called STAND and was created to encourage men to wash their hands after using the facilities. Latvia-based designer Kaspars Jursons has a new design for the urinal in the men's room and it includes a tap . But opinion is divided about whether it is hygienic to wash your hands in a urinal. The tap is hands-free and activated by sensors, arguably making it more hygienic than a traditional tap and even easier to use. Mr . Jursons said: 'If you did not have the habit of washing your hands . after you go to the bathroom before, you will definitely be reminded . now, when you are faced with a tap right at the urinal.' A recent study by environmental health experts at Michigan State University, found that just one in 20 people wash their hands for long enough to kill harmful germs after visiting the toilet. The design is called STAND and it encourages all men to wash their hands after their bathroom activity. The tap is hands-free and activated by sensors . Furthermore, a third do not use soap and 10 per cent do not wash their hands at all. The research named and shamed men as particularly bad at washing their hands correctly. Hand washing is the single most effective thing to do to reduce the spread of infectious diseases, according to the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. Failing to sufficiently wash hands contributes to nearly 50 per cent of all food borne illness outbreaks, it said. Just one in 20 people wash their hands for long enough to kill harmful germs after visiting the toilet. Furthermore, a third do not use soap and 10 per cent do not wash their hands at all . Experts say it takes 15 to 20 seconds of vigorous hand washing with soap and water to effectively kill the germs which cause infections. Yet the study found that people washed their hands for, on average, only about six seconds. A third of people do not use soap when washing their hands and 10 per cent do not wash their hands at all . The research named and shamed men as particularly bad at washing their hands correctly. Another study found that posters reminding people to wash their hands really did have a big effect. The designer hoped that making a tap so convenient will provide a similar prompt . Professor Carl Borchgrevink, associate professor of hospitality business and his team observed hand washing in toilets in bars, restaurants and other public establishments. The study claims to be one of the first to take into account factors such as duration of the hand washing and whether people used soap. Among the findings were that 15 per cent of men did not wash their hands at all, compared with seven per cent of women and when they did wash their hands, only 50 per cent of men used soap, compared with 78 per cent of women. Research found that 15 per cent of men did not wash their hands at all, compared with seven per cent of women and when they did wash their hands, only 50 per cent of men used soap, compared with 78 per cent of women . In another study, researchers from a group of US universities recently revealed that men are more likely to wash their hands after going to the toilet if they see messages reminding them to do so. The scientists posted signs in college restrooms that read 'four out of five students wash their hands EVERY time they use the bathroom'. Before the posters went up male participants self-reported washing their hands 75per cent of the time but after the reminders were pasted above sinks this figure jumped to 86 per cent. Experts say it takes 15 to 20 seconds of vigorous hand washing with soap and water to effectively kill the germs which cause infections .","Latvian designer's urinal aims to promote hand-washing among men .

"Costa Rica coach Jorge Luis Pinto has called on FIFA to clamp down on Arjen Robben's diving. Pinto and his team face Robben and Holland in the last of the World Cup quarter-finals at Arena Fonte Nova on Saturday night knowing that they need another incredible performance to get through. Grounded: Arjen Robben and Nigel de Jong warm up for a training session in Rio . But Pinto turned up the temperature in the build-up when asked about Robben and his tendency to go down easily. 'This is one of the most important questions I have been asked in this World Cup,' he said. 'Diving. This is something that makes us worry a lot. We're really worried about that. 'I would like to ask FIFA and the referees to watch Robben closely. 'We're really worried about his diving.' Robben was heavily criticised after winning a penalty in Holland's last game against Mexico. After that game he admitted diving to win a free-kick earlier in the game. Theatrical: Arjen Robben won the decisive penalty in Holland's 2-1 victory over Mexico . 'He has admitted it doing it,' added Pinto. 'I hope the referee watches him very closely tomorrow. 'I would like FIFA and the referee to watch out because it is very important and can have a huge influence on the result.' Saturday's referee is Ravshan Irmatov from Uzbekistan and Pinto believes he should book Robben if he catches him cheating. 'That may be the most logical solution,' he said. 'Maybe he would have to leave the field because he gets two yellow cards for diving. 'Why not? That could happen. 'I want to trust the referees. Let's see what happens.'","Arjen Robben admitted to diving in Holland's 2-1 World Cup win against Mexico .

"Alison Russell is the first ever judge to be allowed to use the title Ms . A senior judge has been allowed to take a feminist title for the first time. Newly-appointed High Court judge Alison Russell will be known on the bench as Ms Justice Russell, it was confirmed yesterday. A spokesman for the judiciary said that the judge, known as Alison Russell QC until her elevation to the High Court, had asked for the title and it had been approved as ‘official nomenclature’. The decision to allow a judge to be addressed that way was taken by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas and Sir James Munby, the judge who heads the family courts where 55-year-old Ms Justice Russell will operate. It is a departure from past practice, in which women judges were not permitted to deviate from established forms of address. After Elizabeth Butler-Sloss became the first female Appeal judge in 1988 she was forced to accept the title set down in law. As a result for six years she presided over cases as Lord Justice Butler-Sloss. There were signs yesterday that judicial staff remain slow to adjust to the new form of address. An official announcement calls the new judge Ms. Russell, complete with full stop, and then goes on to refer to her as Miss Russell when describing her career. Ms Russell, who will sit at the High Court, pictured, will be the first judge in history to use the title Ms . Ms Russell, born in Harrogate to a Scottish family, was public school educated at Wellington but then, unusually for a successful lawyer, took a degree not at an ancient university but at the then South Bank Polytechnic. She became a barrister, specialising in human rights and family law, shorly after leaving college. She was a Queen’s Counsel by 2008 and a Deputy High Court judge in 2011. The judge, who has no children, is unmarried and lives with her partner Julian Francis in Brixton in South London. She describes her interests as Spain, Handel, cooking, reading, and playing with her niece and nephews.","Alison Russell QC appointment to the High Court was announced yesterday .

"The NBA honored star college player Isaiah Austin with a ceremonial draft pick last night - just days after he learned that a rare genetic condition meant he would never be able to play again. Austin, who played for Baylor University in Texas, was expected to be picked in the second round of the draft, but less than a week ago he learned the devastating news that he had a rare genetic condition called Marfan syndrome, which affects the body’s connective tissue. He said before the diagnosis he had dreamed of NBA Commissioner Adam Silver reading out his name at the draft - and on Thursday night, Silver made that dream a reality. 'I want to take a moment to recognize Baylor center Isaiah Austin,' Silver said between the 15th and 16th picks in the first round. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Baylor center Isaiah Austin poses for a photo with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver after being granted ceremonial first round pick during the 2014 NBA draft on Thursday night . Moved: Austin, who learned last week that he will never be able to play again, wipes away his tears on stage . 'You may have heard about Isaiah. He is one of the nation's best collegiate players, and was expected to be picked tonight before the discovery just a few days ago that he had a genetic disorder called Marfan syndrome and is no longer able to play competitive basketball. 'Like the other young men here tonight, Isaiah committed himself through endless hard work and dedication to a potential career as a professional basketball player, and we wanted to make sure he fulfilled at this part of his dream. 'So it gives me great pleasure to say, that with the next pick in the 2014 NBA draft, the NBA selects Isaiah Austin from Baylor University.' Austin, who was at the event at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York with his family, hugged his relatives and wiped away his tears as he took to the stage, while the crowd stood and cheered. Before shaking hands with Silver, he put on a hat with the NBA logo - rather than the team logos worn by the other newly-picked drafts. Overwhelmed: As the crowd got to its feet, Austin wiped away his tears after his name was called . Loved: Austin, who was diagnosed with a rare condition last week, hugged his family as his mom looked on . Marfan syndrome is an inherited disorder that affects connective tissue, which are the fibers that support organs and other structures in the body. Marfan syndrome most commonly affects the heart, eyes, blood vessels and skeleton. It's caused by a defect in the gene that usually allows the body to produce a protein that helps give connective tissue its elasticity and strength. People with the syndrome are usually tall and thin, with disproportionally long arms, legs, fingers and toes, and may have a curved spine, flat feet or nearsightedness. Treatment usually includes medications to keep blood pressure low to reduce the strain on weakened blood vessels. Depending on the severity of symptoms and the part of the body that's affected, surgery may be necessary. If the heart or blood vessels, such as the aorta in the heart, are affected, the . condition can become life-threatening. About 1 in 5,000 people have Marfan syndrome, and it affects men and women of all races and ethnic groups equally. Source: Mayo Clinic . 'It's one of the biggest blessings of my life,' Austin said in an interview with ESPN. 'I've worked so hard to get to this point and unfortunately it was taken away, but when God closes one door, he opens up another for you. 'It's been the toughest week of my life, but I have a great support system behind me. My family has been with me the whole way. And God is really just putting will power in my heart to help me get through this.' On CNN's New Day on Friday, he said that the ceremony proved 'just what a classy man [Silver] is'. 'I knew he was going to honor me, but I didn't know he was going to make a draft pick,' Austin explained. 'It was really unbelieveblae just for him to even invite me.' Austin, a . former standout at Grace Prep in Arlington, was forced to end his . playing career after being diagnosed with the rare genetic disorder just . last week. He . told CNN that he had always felt physically fine but after taking a . physical in Chicago recently, doctors said that his EKG looked . irregular. After . doctors struggled to determine the problem, they carried out blood work . and his mother, Lisa Green, received a call from the doctor last week . with the news. She drove nine hours from Kansas to Texas so that she could deliver the news herself. 'As soon . as I walked in the room, I just remember seeing her face,' he said. 'It . was just tears. It's a moment that I'll never forget... one of those . memories just locked in your mind forever. Thankful: Austin said that the honor showed just how classy NBA Commissioner Adam Silver was . 'I just had to hold it together for my family, especially for my little brother and sister because I knew they were in the room and they were looking up to me, so I had to stay strong for them. 'I held it together as best as I could and said that we were going to get this together.' He said he will now undergo yearly heart checks and, if doctors have concerns, he may need open heart surgery in the future. But for now, they're saying his health is looking good. According . to the Mayo Clinic, complications from Marfan syndrome can weaken the . aorta, the artery that supplies blood from the heart to the rest of the . body. 'They said I wouldn't be able to play basketball anymore,' he told ESPN. 'They . found the gene in my blood sample and they told me that my arteries and . my heart are enlarged, and that if I overwork myself or push to hard . that...my heart could rupture.' Major talent: Austin was projected as a first-round pick in the NBA draft, which is just days away . Medical professionals recommended that Austin stop playing immediately. The seven-foot-one Austin averaged 12.1 . points and 6.9 rebounds this season and announced in April that he would . leave Baylor after his sophomore season. But Baylor coach Scott Drew said that the discovery means Austin will not be able to play in the NBA. Austin . had already overcome the odds when he became blind in his right eye . during middle school, a disability he kept quiet about until earlier . this year. Drew added that he hopes Austin will return to school and finish his degree. 'This is devastating news, but Isaiah . has the best support system anyone could ask for, and he knows that all . of Baylor Nation is behind him,' Drew said. Support: On CNN on Friday, Austin recounted the moment his mother, left, told him about the diagnosis . 'His . health is the most important thing, and while it's extremely sad that . he won't be able to play in the NBA, our hope is that he'll return to . Baylor to complete his degree and serve as a coach in our program.' He became emotional an interview with ESPN after finding out the life-changing news. 'The . draft is four days away and you know, I had a dream that my name was . going to be called. But uh...I'm sorry (inaudible),' Austin broke off, . unable to speak. The brave young athlete managed to pull himself together, and had a message for his fans. 'For . all my supporters, I just want to tell them sorry. Sorry they couldn't . see me play in the NBA. But it's not the end, you know. It's only the . beginning.'","Isaiah Austin, 20, was days away from his NBA dreams coming true when he received devastating news that he would no longer be able to play .

Arguably the tournament's most impressive side so far. Topped their group easily with nine points from nine available and then comfortably saw off a Luis Suarez-less Uruguay. But now though they face the tournament's toughest task in the form of play hosts Brazil on home territory. Jumping for joy: Arjen Robben will be making an appearance in the last eight - watch out Costa Rica . Together: Costa Rica will be underdogs against Holland but that has suited them so far . Holland . Finished above Chile / Beat Mexico 2-1 in the last-16 . Impressive starters in the group, Holland beat world champions Spain 5-1 before seeing off Australia. Their win against Chile was almost a non-fixture before facing Mexico in the last-16 where it became much more difficult. Late goals from Wesley Sneijder and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar just about dragged the Dutch through in normal time. Costa Rica . Finished above Uruguay / Beat Greece 5-3 on penalties (1-1 draw) in the last-16 . It's fair to call the rest of the sides listed here 'favourites' but Costa Rica certainly have not been at any stage of the competition. Just looking at group winners and runners up ignores their brilliant group finish above long-established nations Italy and England. They then beat Greece on penalties after holding out with 10 men for almost an hour. Yes! France's fans celebrate their qualification in the streets of Paris after beating Nigeria . Super eight: Mesut Ozil, Andre Schurrle and Thomas Muller have all scored for the Germans . France . Finished above Switzerland / Beat Nigeria 2-0 in the last-16 . The French have been experimenting with playing star striker Karim Benzema in the middle and wide - when they have favoured the latter they have often been devastating. Nigeria looked like they could cause the French to implode after frustrating them for long periods but their patience and firepower eventually made the difference. Germany . Finished above USA / Beat Algeria 2-1 in the last-16 . A battle with the French in the Maracana now awaits after Germany saw off plucky Algeria in the last round. They opened their campaign brilliantly with a big win over Portugal but have since occasionally stuttered. The win over Algeria showed some defensive frailties but when Thomas Muller is on top form they can be hard to stop, too. Made it: Lionel Messi and his team-mates are down to the last eight . We're through! Belgium's players celebrate their win . Argentina . Finished above Nigeria / Beat Switzerland 1-0 in the last-16 . Lionel Messi has four man of the match awards from four games at this World Cup - and that is effectively Argentina's story so far. Messi scored four of their five goals in the group as they overcame Bosnia, Iran and Nigeria - and he then had to rescue them by laying out Angel Di Maria's late extra time winner against Switzerland. Belgium . Finished above Algeria / Beat USA 2-1 AET in the last-16 . The Belgians have somehow won all of their games so far but arguably had their reputation tarnished. A lack of attacking football and the fact they have just spent a total of just 52 minutes ahead in all of their games has made them look unimpressive. But they showed against the USA that they still have plenty of firepower, forcing Tim Howard into a record 15 saves. They could potentially be coming into form at just the right time.

"As the star winger of Manchester United, he's arguably one of the most able-bodied men in the country. Which begs the question, why was Luis Nani parking his Chevy in a disabled parking bay? The fleet-footed 26-year-old was photographed pulling his bright red Chevrolet Camaro into the spot, which was clearly marked by a sign saying 'Disabled Badge Holders Only'. Man United's Nani parks his bright Chevrolet Camaro in a disabled space in Wilmslow town centre . The winger was carrying a bunch of letters as he left his car in the badge-holder only space . The disabled bay is meant to be for . those with official permits, and are designed to provide ease of access . for motorists with disabilities. By parking in the space, Nani deprived a Blue Badge holder from potentially parking in the spot. But that didn't deter the Portugese player, who signed from Sporting Lisbon in 2007 in a deal worth £20million, leaving his car there for 20 minutes while he went out in Wilmslow, Cheshire. Wearing a pair of dark blue jeans, a cream jacket and spotless black trainers, the footballer carried a bunch of letters as he climbed out of his sports car, which can fetch a price tag starting at £35,000. The player, who has made more than 200 appearances for United, is reportedly earning £130,000 a year. The average price for a car parking spot in Wilmslow for up to an hour costs a motorist an affordable 60 pence, according to Cheshire East council's figures. Disabled badge holders only: A sign stated that the bay was designated just for those with badges . Manchester United's Nani has become a star player of the team - and is reportedly earning £130,000 a week . The average price of an annual parking . space pass in Wilmslow is £886.67 - meaning with a year's estimated . salary before tax, the player could afford to buy 7,629 annual passes. Those who are automatically provided with a Blue Badge in Cheshire are those who receive the higher rate of the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance, people who are registered blind or severely sight impaired and residents who receive War Pensioners' Mobility Supplement. Others who are automatically entitles to the badge are people who been awarded a benefit under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme and have been assessed and certified by the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency as having a permanent and substantial disability which causes inability to walk or very considerable difficulty in walking. Those with a severe disability in both arms who regularly drive a vehicle but cannot operate or have considerable difficulty in operating all or some types of parking meter also receive the badge - and would have been entitled to use the space. Badge holders are entitled to park in other spots if their designated spaces are full, Cheshire East council states. It is unclear whether the footballer didn't spot the sign, or couldn't find another parking space within the car park. Manchester United have been contacted by the Mail Online for a response.","Luis Nani spotted parking in disabled bay in Wilmslow, Cheshire .

"Their faces are etched with deep lines that reveal lives lived in hardship. Their expressions captured by UK-based artist and photographer Lee Jeffries, who strives to reveal the human face of addiction, the reality of homelessness and the real face of poverty through his work. Travelling the globe Mr Jeffries, who is a full-time accountant, has sought to capture the faces of those people shunned by society. His latest project took him to Miami in Florida. There he met Margo Stevens, a former porn star resigned to living on the streets of the Overtown district. Photographer Lee Jeffries has made it his mission in life to give a human face to poverty, addiction and homelessness. For his latest project he spent two weeks in Miami, where he met former porn star Margo Stevens (pictured) Ms Stevens (right) was a successful adult film star in the 1990s, living a comfortable life from the money she made, supplement by working as an escort. Today she lives on the streets of the Overtown district of Miami, in an abandoned garage with five other girls, who sell their bodies for sex to feed their drug addictions . In two weeks, Jeffries delved beyond the labels that are so readily used to define Ms Stevens and others. He looked past the 'prostitute', the 'homeless down and out' and instead reveals Ms Stevens to be a mother-figure who reaches out to the younger women around her, offering advice, shelter and a friend to turn to. Pictured is a woman called Trish, who works on the streets using the name 'Snow' 'Her story is stark,' Jeffries told MailOnline. 'She is a beautiful person, whose story is both fascinating and tragic. 'She's been exploited her whole life, but still she remains incredibly human. 'Margo was a well-known porn star in the 1990s, she lived the life back then. But her fall to life now hit me hard.' Jeffries said he found Ms Stevens sleeping in an abandoned garage, meausring 12ft by 6ft, with five other girls. Most are addicted to heroin, and all live off the money they make as sex workers. He spent two weeks with Ms Stevens learning about the fate which befell her. After stripping in clubs in Cleveland for a living as a young woman, she fell into working in the adult film industry becoming an escort. For years she lived comfortably from the earnings she made. But eventually life dealt her a cruel hand. Far from being able to distance himself from his art, Jeffries is immersed in it. He admits, the project touched him, leaving him angry at the way the adult film industry exploits women like Ms Stevens. Sex worker Trish is pictured without the wig she wears, when she assumes her alter ego Snow (picture above) Through his pictures, Jeffries uncovers stories of survival, women driven to selling their bodies as a means of feeding their addiction struggling through life with nowhere else to turn. Pictured is Brittany . The girls in Overtown survive. Labelled ""crack whores"" some will use their bodies to get the next $10 fix and are often treated worse than stray dogs by the men there. Jeffries said: 'I don't judge Margo,' he said. 'She is in a spiral for whatever reason, it is not important. She chooses not to help herself and maybe the grip of her addiction is such that she can't. She understands what she is doing, the life she is living. She understands the choices she makes, she just cannot see a way out.' A devastating spiral of homelessness, drug addiction and prostitution ensued.

She is so much more than the drugs and the prostitution, the labels. She cares for the younger girls she stays with, often to the detriment of herself.' Jeffries hopes his latest series of portraits, of which Ms Stevens has become the focus, will help to raise awareness of people like Ms Stevens, those struggling to face the reality of poverty, addiction and living on the streets. Pictured is Latoria . Ms Stevens is not alone in her hardship. Though each has a distinct and unique voice, there are millions of people across the world like Ms Stevens, real people with nowhere to call home. Pictured is Latoria . Of his work, Jeffries said: 'This is a small ripple but it is significant in terms of what one person can do' Far from being able to distance himself from his art, Jeffries is immersed in it. He admits, the project touched him, leaving him angry at the way the adult film industry exploits women like Ms Stevens. In an interview filmed by Jeffries, Ms Stevens reveals her starting rate in the industry was $500 and the contracts she signed were such that she made no money off the continued reproduction of her performances. 'A lot of people in the industry are quite slimy,' she said. 'They do a lot of exploiting. There are a lot of things about the adult industry that need to change.' Addressing the financial exploitation, she adds: 'It makes me feel a fool. I'm responsible for that. I let that happen.' But when asked by Jeffries if she regrets her path in life, Ms Stevens tells the camera, 'no'. 'Not at all,' she said. It is a brave and honest answer, one which garners Jeffries' respect and admiration.

"Robin van Persie’s wonder goal against Spain at the World Cup almost never happened – because the Manchester United star was hiding a secret groin injury which threatened to jeopardise his World Cup. Van Persie will travel to Zurich on Monday to take part on FIFA’s grand gala which will decide the best goal of the year – which has van Persie’s diving header up against Spain competing with James’ volley for Colombia against Uruguay and Republic of Ireland’s Stephanie Roche’s stunning volley for Pearmount United to win the Puskas Award for the greatest goal of 2014. But van Pesie has revealed for the first time that he was hiding a serious injury in the run up to the game which he feared could keep him out of the World Cup. Robin van Perise's diving header against Spain was one of the most memorable goals of the World Cup . The Holland striker high fives manager Louis van Gaal after the pair concealed a secret injury . Van Persie said: ‘I boarded the plane to Rio de Janeiro with Van Gaal and the Dutch team and I was worried. To be honest, I was really, really worried. I had been sidelined for almost eight weeks at the end of the season, after being kicked from behind against Olympiakos in the Champions League. I spent all my days trying to recover, doing long hours of rehab.’’ ‘The boss wanted me to prove my fitness in a full game. That was supposed to happen in our last warm up match against Wales. In more than three months I had never played more than 70 minutes. ‘But my left groin went stiff (during the first half against Wales). Not just a little, I was in agony. At half time I had to tell the boss the worst message: “I really want to play 90 minutes for you, but I simply can’t carry on.” It was a week before we had to play the World Champions.’ Van Persie trains with United team-mates Juan Mata (left) and Victor Valdes ahead of the Southampton game . The former Arsenal frontman has scored eight Premier League goals during this campaign . Van Persie says that he and van Gaal decided to keep the injury a secret from the Dutch squad, because they had so many inexperienced players and they didn’t wish to demoralise them. Van Persie said: ‘Nobody expected us to do well anyway. We, the boss, the doctor and I, decided to keep it quiet. Nobody in the world was allowed to know. There was too much at stake, for the boss, for the team, for everyone. Sometimes you have to operate like that. Van Persie declared himself fit two days before the game but says that the tensions in the build-up to the game explained his ecstatic reaction to the goal, which was also a crucial equaliser in the match that Holland eventually won 5-1, and his run to bench, where he famously exchanged a high-five with van Gaal. James Rodriguez's (centre) wonder strike against Uruguay is a contender for the Puskas award . He said: ‘When you know all this, when you realize all the drama that went off, the pressure on the boss, on the team, on me, people probably now understand why this was for so many reasons the greatest and most important goal of my life. ‘The stadium exploded, the bench exploded, but so did my head! I wanted the ball to go in from that flying header so desperately that I did something which I had never done before - I kept looking at the ball while I was flying, until I landed with a massive bang with my face forward on the ground. ‘The real reason why I wanted to run towards the dug out, was that my wife and kids were sitting right behind the bench on the first row. But before I got there Van Gaal came running out. It was marvellous. I wanted celebrate with everyone and with him too. Van Persie scores a penalty against Brazil as Holland claim third place at the 2014 World Cup . Van Gaal performed a masterstroke to ease players' tensions at the tournament in Brazil . ‘That goal, on the biggest stage of world football, was not just a dream coming true, it also changed the entire World Cup for us and the way the boss made his entrance at Man United. In a couple of weeks our whole world looked different that summer.’ Van Persie also revealed a softer side to van Gaal and how he managed to dispel apprehension in the young squad in the run-up to the Spain game. ‘There was so much tension in the squad. Their nerves had taken over. On the day of our first match against Spain the team was about to collapse because of mental pressure. ‘And that is when Van Gaal came up with his first master stroke. A few hours before the game he invited all the wives and the kids to the team hotel. I was playing pool with my son on the day of the game! And all the others were relaxing with their family too.’","Robin van Persie was carrying a secret injury at the 2014 World Cup .

"Barbara Bush, former first lady and grandmother to reporter Jenna Bush Hager, has spoken about losing her three-year-old daughter to leukemia over half a century ago. In an intimate interview with Jenna, the 87-year-old reveals the heartache she and former President George H. W. Bush, who is called 'gampy', experienced after little Robin Bush, Jenna's aunt, was diagnosed with only two weeks to live. 'I was combing her hair and holding her hand,' Mrs Bush recalled on Today. 'I saw that little body, I saw her spirit go.' Scroll down for video . Brave Barbara: Barbara Bush (right), former first lady and grandmother to Today's Jenna Bush Hager (left), has spoken about losing her three-year-old daughter to leukemia over half a century ago . Born on December 20th, 1949, Robin was the youngest of three brothers; and two years younger than her brother, and future 43rd President, George W. Bush. Jenna said, referring to Robin, who would be 63 years old if she were still alive today: 'Gampy actually said recently he hopes when he passes away that's who he will see first.' 'It is who he'll see first,' said Mrs Bush. My girl: Mrs Bush recalls Robin being 'quiet and gentle, and she had lovely little blond curls' Heartache and loss: In an intimate interview with Jenna, the 87-year-old reveals what she and former President George H. W. Bush went through after little Robin Bush was diagnosed with only two weeks to live . 'She was quiet and gentle, and she had lovely little blond curls,' she added. At age three, Mrs Bush began to notice her daughter's energy waning, and took her to the doctor for a simple check-up. She said: 'She was listless, she didn't want to do anything, just wanted to rest, go out and watch cars go by, so I called the doctor and said, ""Can I bring Robin out? I think she has spring fever,"" and the doctor sort of laughed. Recalling Robin: Mrs Bush tells Jenna on Today, 'I was combing her hair and holding her hand. I saw that little body, I saw her spirit go' Devoted granddaughter: Jenna Bush Hager, who would have been Robin's niece had she survived, talks to her grandmother about her 'angel' 'We went out and she had a few bruises on her and the doctor took a blood test and said I'll call you. 'She . told that is Robin had leukemia. ""What do you do for leukemia?"" Well, . she said, ""You don't do anything. She's going to die,"" and we said, ""No, . I don't think so"". And she said, ""My advice is take her home, love her . and in about two weeks she will be gone."" Instead, the couple took Robin across America to a hospital willing to try treatment on a child. Seriously sick: It wasn't until age three that Ms Bush began to notice her daughter's energy waning, and took her to the doctor for a simple check-up . Family of four: Born on December 20th, 1949, Robin was the youngest of three brothers . ""They took bone marrow tests which were painful,' Mrs Bush said. 'A lot of blood. they put her on chemo, and poor gampy, every time she got a blood transfusion he's have to leave the room.' Seven months later, almost age four, Robin died. Then Mrs Bush made the easy decision, she said, to donate her child's body to research. 'I think it made gampy and me feel something good is coming out of this precious little life and today, almost nobody dies of leukemia,' said Mrs Bush. Family time: Robin, pictured with her father and brother, George W. H. bush and George W. Bush, was diagnosed with leukemia and give only two weeks to live . Don't give up: Mr Bush took Robin across America to a hospital willing to try treatment on a child . Brotherly love: Robin, who Mrs Bush describes as 'her angel', was two years younger than President-to-be George W. Bush . Today, the survival rate for a child surviving leukemia is 90per cent. At St Jude's Children's Research Hospital, which was founded nearly a decade after Robin 's death, the hospital's National Outreach Director, Marlo Thomas explained that its first doctors were willing to try new techniques to beat leukemia. She said: 'We still have cells and DNA from patients that we treated in the . 1960s, and now that technology has gotten better, we can go back and learn what . caused those cancers and why some children were cured and others . weren't.' Not yet four: Seven months later, almost age four, . Robin died. Then Ms Bush made the easy decision, she said, to donate her . child's body to research . Never forgotten: Mrs Bush remembers her daughter as 'an angel; she's not a sadness or a sorrow' Mrs Bush said: 'What on earth could be better in the eyes of god than a hospital that saves children's lives?' before adding, 'George and I do talk about it. Maybe more recently in the last two or three years than before. 'We're getting older, and - and robin to me is a joy. She's like an angel to me; she's not a sadness or a sorrow. Those little fat arms around my neck. 'She's still with us. We need her and yet we have . her. We can't touch her, and yet we can feel her.

"Boots is to start selling e-cigarettes from next week. The high street chemist will stock the brand Puritane, made by a subsidiary of Imperial Tobacco. A spokesperson for Boots said: 'From listening to our customers, we also . know many people are looking for access to an alternative to smoking, . such as e- cigarettes. 'From 24 February 2014 we will begin selling a high-quality, safety . reviewed and rigorously tested e-cigarette called Puritane to people . aged 18 and over.' Boots is to start selling e-cigarettes from next week. The high street chemist will stock the brand Puritane . Boots says it is working with the Imperial Tobacco subsidiary Fontem Ventures, which it's claimed operates separately from the tobacco firm. It has spent two years working with Fontem to develop 'a high quality (pharmaceutical grade nicotine), safety reviewed and rigorously tested e-cigarette'. The e-cigarette will cost £7.99 for a disposable version and £22.99 for the starter kit which contains a battery, a charger and two cartomisers. An e-cigarette contains three components: a battery, an atomiser and a cartridge containing nicotine suspended in propylene glycol and water. When the user sucks on the e-cigarette, the liquid in the cartridge is heated so that some of it evaporates. This vapour delivers nicotine into the user's lungs. There is no smoke, but some nicotine vapour is released into the surrounding air as the user exhales. Some e-cigarettes have an indicator light at the end which glows when the user is inhaling to give an added touch of realism. Source: WebMD . Until now, the company has resisted selling e-cigarettes, but rival  Lloyds Pharmacy stocks BAT’s . Vype. The move goes against advice issued by pharmacists’ professional body, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, which advises against pharmacies selling e-cigarettes until they become regulated products. The Pharmaceutical Journal reports that Puritane will only be available in Boots and will not be advertised. It is understood that customers wishing to buy the product will have to have a discussion with a pharmacist to ensure they are sold 'appropriately'. The magazine also reports that the . pharmacy chain does not want to be seen to be advocating e-cigarettes . over nicotine replacement therapy such as patches and gum. On average, some 7 per cent of EU . citizens have used electronic cigarettes in a quit smoking attempt, . while in the UK, this figure rises to 9 per cent. The . Medicines and Healthcare . Products Regulatory Agency said last year that e-cigarettes would be . regulated as medicines from 2016 in order to help people stop smoking. A spokesperson for the health charity ASH . - Action on Smoking and Health - told MailOnline: 'The current evidence . would suggest that e-cigarettes are helping some smokers to move away . from smoking which is positive. 'Using an e-cigarette poses much less risk to health than smoking – for the smoker and those around them. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said last year that e-cigarettes would be regulated as medicines from 2016 in order to help people stop smoking . 'We want to see safe and effective products on the market which support as many smokers as possible to quit. 'At the moment the quality of these products is highly variable and none are licensed as medicines. 'We support them being made available to those who want to use them, however, until they are licenced as medicines it is important that health professionals continue to direct smokers to products which are licenced and known to be effective. ' An estimated 1.3 million people in the UK are thought to use e-cigarettes. The majority of them buy products that are manufactured in China where there is very little regulation of their production. Regardless of the health impacts, many of Britain’s biggest companies have felt required to ban e-cigarettes because they look too similar to the tobacco versions. McDonald’s, Wetherspoons and The Slug and Lettuce have all banned e-cigarettes as the debate about their safety rages on.","Chemist will stock Puritane brand, made by subsidiary of Imperial Tobacco .

"Loves the Surface, but tweets with the iPad: Oprah Winfrey's endorsement of Microsoft's tablet was marred by her choice of Twitter client . Oprah Winfrey has been vocal about her love for Microsoft's new Surface tablet, claiming earlier this month that it was one of her favourite things. But that didn't stop the chat show queen sending a tweet claiming she'd bought 12 as Christmas gifts - via the Twitter app on her iPad. Microsoft has spent $1.5billion and enlisted a string of celebrities to help market their latest gadget - a rival to Apple's offering. Gwen Stefani, Jessica Alba and Oprah have all endorsed Windows 8 and its mobile phone equivalent, with the latter putting the Surface on her list of 48 favourite things, TechCrunch reported. However, the latest PR gaffe seems to suggest that however much Oprah promotes Microsoft's latest tech offering, she likes Apple's version even more. But Oprah's choice of platform highlights the dearth of decent Twitter apps for Surface operating system Windows RT, TechCrunch suggests. Twitter itself is yet to release an official Twitter client in the Windows Store, but the social messaging site's apps remain among the most popular programs on other platforms. It is thought that Twitter's delay in releasing an official Windows RT app is a sign that big app developers are not allocating the same resources to Windows Store apps. But even if Oprah had not been able to track down one of the several third-party Twitter apps that have been published for the Surface, she could have still accessed the Twitter website to send her tweet. Instead, it appears she used Twitter's official app on the iPad to send the tweet. Oprah's tweet: She is one of a string of celebrities enlisted by Microsoft to support their latest products . Oprah's slip is just the latest blow to Microsoft after the launch of the Surface was marred by a string of negative reviews and, two weeks later, resignation of the head of its Windows division. The tablet, which is on the market for between £399 and £559, was met with a lukewarm response, with reviewers criticising its lack of apps and branding it 'a compromise'. Even the most positive review, from technology magazine Wired, would only go so far as describing the tablet as 'quite good'. Lukewarm response: The release of Microsoft's iPad rival was marred by a string of negative reviews and, two weeks later, the resignation of the head of the company's Windows division . The price is the same as the cheapest iPad, pitching Microsoft into a head to head battle with Apple, which has a far greater consumer electronics pedigree. The chaos which met the product launch was underlined by the departure of Steven Sinofsky, head of Microsoft's Windows unit, a 23-year Microsoft veteran widely tipped as the company's next chief executive. MailOnline contacted Microsoft for a comment on the Oprah gaffe, but by the time of publication had received no response.","Chat show queen claimed earlier this month that the iPad rival was one of her favourite things .

"Hard-up parents were left furious after a school asked them to fork out hundreds of pounds on iPads for lessons and homework. Staff at Rossett School in Harrogate, North Yorkshire told children to ask their parents to buy them the £300 tablet for their work. But the request has infuriated parents, hundreds of whom attended a showdown meeting with the headteacher over the cost. A row has broken out at Rossett School in Harrogate, North Yorkshire after parents were asked to buy iPads for their children . One parent at the 1,400-pupil co-educational, which has academy status, said: 'This could create a two tier system. 'We can probably afford one, but not everyone can, especially if you have more than one child. 'The kids were all taken into an assembly and told about it. Straight away you are hamstrung.' The anonymous parent said many people's concerns surrounded security, as 1,400 iPads would be carried in and out of the school on a daily basis. 'As a parent, you would do anything you can for your child,' he added. 'You don't want your child to be the only one in the class who hasn't got one. 'There is a bad taste in the mouth as this hasn't been communicated well and the school has been totally unprepared for the sort of concerns we have.' Headteacher Pat Hunter said overall the school, which was founded in 1973, received a positive response. She said: 'It's important to adapt to the constantly changing needs of students so they can reach their full potential. 'We understand buying an iPad is not a cheaper option, but we believe it is a very worthwhile investment.' Expensive: An iPad2 can cost more than £300, beyond the reach of many parents at Rossett School in Harrogate . Outlining options to buy outright at a lower price or through monthly payments, the head said children who still couldn't afford to one would be able to borrow the equipment from the school. She added: 'A lot of research had gone into the scheme. 'There will be no child that will be disadvantaged because of financial reasons. 'We have always made sure all children are given the same opportunities and this will be no exception.'

"England insist they have followed the latest concussion protocol after selecting Courtney Lawes and Dylan Hartley to face South Africa a week after both suffered blows to the head against the All Blacks. Northampton lock Lawes was forced to leave the field in the first half of the 24-21 defeat in the QBE series opener against the world champions with an angry, egg-shaped swelling around his left temple. Despite failing a pitch-side test to determine whether he was concussed, the 25-year-old has been passed fit after subsequent examinations and procedures. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch England training at Pennyhill Park ahead of Saturday's Test . Head coach Stuart Lancaster insists England have followed the latest concussion protocol . Under previous guidelines, Lawes and Hartley would have faced a mandatory three-week rest period after being diagnosed with concussion. Now they are preparing for a high-intensity contest just seven days later but England head coach Stuart Lancaster is adamant that players’ welfare is being protected. He said: ‘The whole process has been ratified at the highest level and we’ve got to trust the process. Certainly from my dealings with Courtney this week, he’s been symptom-free from Sunday. ‘He’s gone through the graduated return — cycling, running, non-contact skills — and he’s ticked every box. So it’s pretty comprehensive. He and I and the medical team and everyone feel very happy that he’s ready to play.’ Courtney Lawes (right) will start against South Africa despite suffering a nasty head injury last Saturday . Asked to confirm that Lawes was not involved in any training early in the week, Lancaster added: ‘He wasn’t involved in contact training. I can’t remember that. I’ll need to check the tape. I don’t remember him being involved in any training. He basically stood in the line-out. He wasn’t involved in Tuesday training.’ Lawes is satisfied that his long-term health had been given due consideration before he was selected to face the Boks. ‘As a player, you’ve always got to think of your well-being, especially when you’ve got a family,’ he said. Dylan Hartley (left) also suffered a blow to the head against New Zealand but will start against South Africa . ‘But at the same time, you know you are in good hands. I knew that the England doctor was not going to let me play if I wasn’t right. ‘I didn’t get knocked out and concussed as badly as I have done in the past. In the past, I’ve had a bit of memory loss. At the weekend, I didn’t have any memory loss. I had a big egg on my head, which was quite painful, and I failed the numbers test. They give you four numbers that you have to repeat in reverse order, then five and six. ‘I didn’t really have any symptoms, other than a splitting headache after I got hit in the head. The next day I woke up and felt fine. There weren’t any symptoms, other than a distorted face! To be honest I’ve never had symptoms the day after a game. Bath winger Anthony Watson (left) will make his first run-on start for England against the Springboks . 'When you’ve been knocked out you’re unable to remember much that has happened in the game. It’s a bit like you’re dreaming.’ As expected, England have promoted Bath wing Anthony Watson to the starting XV in place of the injured Semesa Rokoduguni, with Marland Yarde added to the bench. Tom Wood had been a slight injury doubt but he was cleared to play in the back row. Watson has long been a favourite of World Cup-winning coach Sir Clive Woodward and Lancaster said: ‘Anthony has been pushing hard for a while and has been in impressive form for Bath and in training with us. It was great that he got on against New Zealand and we feel he is ready to start.’","England lock Courtney Lawes and hooker Dylan Hartley both left the action at Twickenham last Saturday with head injuries .

"The All Blacks were put through their paces during a training session at Murrayfield as they prepare to defend one of rugby's most one-sided records against Scotland on Saturday. New Zealand have never lost to their hosts in 29 meetings since playing their very first Test in 1905 - while a 25-25 draw at Murrayfield in 1983 is the closest the Scots have come to threatening that statistic.

Only captain Richie McCaw and Ben Smith have retained their places, although both will play in different positions against the Scots. McCaw will start on the blindside flank for the first time, and Smith has moved from the wing to fullback. However, the biggest talking point has been the the return of  Dan Carter - who will start a Test for the first time in a year. The influential fly-half last started a Test against England last November before taking the next seven months off - and his planned return was set back when he broke his leg in the Super Rugby final. Meanwhile, Scotland's New Zealand coach Vern Cotter insists his home country's run will not go on forever and is now dreaming Saturday will be finally be Scotland's day. Speaking ahead of the Test, Cotter said: 'The record against New Zealand has been spoken about around the place. The only thing we have control of, however, is the instant.

"Manchester City face fresh questions from UEFA in the wake of the Frank Lampard debacle over how their extensive network of global companies are sharing the burden of the club’s massive financial losses. City were fined £16million by Europe’s governing body last year for breaking Financial Fair Play regulations, had their transfer spending and wage bill limited and had to reduce their Champions League squad. Since then, they have announced they are on course to meet UEFA’s new rules, having halved losses to £23m, £16m of which would be discounted as part of the UEFA fine. Manchester city owner Sheikh Mansour (centre) looks on during a Premier League match at the Etihad . City were fined £16million by Europe’s governing body last year for breaking Financial Fair Play regulations . However, UEFA is examining whether the creation of a set of subsidiary companies by City’s ‘parent’ company, City Football Group (CFG), allowed them to under-report losses for 2013-14. The lack of transparency over Lampard  and his move, in which it was unclear whether he signed for New York City or Manchester City, has thrown a spotlight on the opaque nature of City’s accounts, which some believe are designed to confuse. Two subsidiary companies, City Football Marketing Ltd and City Football Services Ltd, had operating expenses — or costs, including wages — of £36.7m in the year to May 2014, and posted combined losses of £25.9m. Most of their business was done effectively on behalf of Manchester City. A City spokesperson said: 'The examination of the Club's structure and subsidiary companies is a scheduled and routine part of the UEFA monitoring process.'

"William Pooley, 29, was the first Briton to catch the disease in several decades and was repatriated last month by the RAF . The British nurse evacuated to the UK after contracting the Ebola virus has announced he will return to Africa. William Pooley, 29, was the first Briton to catch the disease in several decades and was repatriated last month by the RAF. He survived the deadly virus after receiving life-saving care at the Royal Free Hospital in London and is now planning to return to Sierra Leone. Speaking to the Guardian Mr Pooley said returning was ‘the least’ he ‘could do’ but that more needs to be done by western powers to help contain the epidemic which is still ravaging large parts of West Africa. He said: ‘It's a global problem and it needs global level leadership so Obama and Cameron... need to show some more leadership on this issue. ‘Sierra Leone needs lots of international health-care workers working with big NGOs like MSF and Red Cross. All of that needs to be increased.’ ‘So while I'm happy to be recovered and alive, there's a lot of stuff on my mind with what's going on back there. ‘It would be relatively safe for me to go back and work there, and it's really the least I could do having received all this amazing care and have people look after me and potentially save my life. It's the least I could do to go back and return the favour to some other people, even just for a little while. ‘The more help they get the less chance there is they get sick. If they get sick they are just going to end up in a ward in Kenema with less chance than I had.’ His mother Jackie admitted that, although she and husband Robin had hoped after the trauma of being evacuated from where he had been working, their son would not return, she ‘would feel very proud of him.’ He said: 'It would be relatively safe for me to go back and work there, and it's really the least I could do having received all this amazing care and have people look after me and potentially save my life' He survived the deadly virus after receiving life-saving care in the high level isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London .","William Pooley, 29, was first Briton to catch the disease in several decades .

Irishman also slams Fergie for Rock of Gibraltar dispute . Roy Keane has revealed he knew how good Cristiano Ronaldo was the first time he saw him play for Sporting Lisbon. The Real Madrid superstar played against Keane's Manchester United side in a friendly in 2003, and Sir Alex Ferguson signed the 18-year-old soon after his impressive display in Sporting's 3-1 win. In his new autobiography The Second Half, out this week, Keane reminisces about the game, in particular the torrid time the Portuguese gave United defender John O'Shea. 'We were playing Sporting Lisbon to celebrate the opening of their stadium. I saw how good Ronaldo was that day. He was up against John O’Shea,' Keane said.

The club concluded negotiations after the game. 'We always joked with Sheasy he had actually sealed the deal by playing like a f****** clown. In fairness to him, he was jet-lagged [from America] like the rest of us.' Keane also praised Ronaldo's dedication and attitude, the legendary former hardman having played with the young forward for two years until Keane's acrimonious departure from Old Trafford in 2005. 'I liked Ronaldo straight away. he had a nice presence about him and a good attitude,' Keane said. 'After watching him train for a few days I thought: “This lad is going to be one of the best players in the world.” 'He was 17 but he was immediately one of the hardest working players at United. He was good looking and he knew it. Looking at some of the other players in front of the mirror I would think: ""You f****** nugget"". But Ronaldo had an innocence to him and a niceness.'

When I was at United I was getting paid good money but I could go: ""Yeah, but I'm giving it back to you"". I didn’t feel that way with this TV work. It’s an easy gig. I don’t like easy gigs. When I heard: ""I liked your commentary last night"". I knew I was only talking bulls*** like the rest of them. Hopefully my bulls*** was a bit better. I wanted to do something that excited me. TV work didn’t excite me. 'I liked Adrian and Lee Dixon, though. What I really enjoyed was the company. I liked meeting people, old players like Liverpool’s Jan Molby. Some United fans saw us together and one of them said: “Why the f*** are you talking to him?”. I felt like saying: “I will speak to who I f***ing want to!""' 'I wonder about the current United dressing room. When a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson is replaced the new man needs a helping hand. Does that mean every player should like him? No. 'But I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better. Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best. 'Looking at what happened to David Moyes, I can only conclude that he didn’t have a strong dressing room. He had a weak dressing room.'

"Axed: Sir Patrick Moore's famous astronomy show The Sky At Night could be pulled from ours screens by December . The Sky at Night is facing the axe after 56 years on television and just a year after the death of Sir Patrick Moore. The popular monthly astronomy programme could even be pulled by as early as December, a decision which has caused widespread anger among viewers. The BBC confirmed yesterday that discussions are currently ongoing over the future of the show, which is scheduled to run until the end of the year. Sir Patrick presented the show’s first episode on 24 April 1957, and continued until 7 January 2013, when his final episode was broadcast following his death 9 December 2012 at the age of 89. He presented a total of 721 episodes, only ever missed one broadcast, in July 2004, when he was taken ill with a severe bout of food poisoning. This made it the longest-running programme with the same presenter in television history. As well as covering general astronomical and space-related topics such as black holes and meteor showers, the programme has also covered the Apollo Moon landings of 1969 and the UK’s total solar eclipse in 1999. Explaining the show’s enduring appeal, Moore said: ‘Astronomy’s a fascinating subject. You look up, you can’t help getting interested and it’s there. We’ve tried to bring it to the people. It’s not me, it’s the appeal of the subject.’ As well featuring many of the world’s leading astronomers, other high-profile guests have included  Arthur C. Clarke, Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong. Since Sir Patrick’s death, the show has since been co-presented by cosmologists Lucie Green and Chris Lintott. In recent years, ratings for the programme hovered around the 500,000 mark. A spokesman said last night: ‘Sky at Night is on air until the end of the year. Plans for subsequent series are being discussed.’ By last night thousands of furious fans had taken to Twitter to try and save the programme from being taken off the air. Hundreds had signed an online petition pleading with BBC bosses not to axe the long-running show. Long-standing: The programme was presented by Moore, pictured here on the show in 1961, from 1957 until he died in 2012 . David Smith  wrote: ‘All but officially announced the BBC is cancelling The Sky at Night. Would the last non-celeb science show please turn out the lights?’ Steve Walker said: ‘The decision to axe The Sky at Night is an insult to the legacy if the program. Shame on you BBC.’ Another wrote: ‘Why would you want to scrap it, BBC? Please, please, please don’t scrap The Sky At Night. Just don’t. Please.’ The series began before the ‘space age’ - but the launch of the world’s first man-made satellite, Sputnik 1, saw interest in astronomy grow. The BBC first commissioned the series in 1957, with senior producer Paul Johnstone choosing Moore, a well-known author of astronomy books, as his presenter. At the time he was paid 25 guineas per fifteen-minute episode. Legend: Moore was paid just 25 guineas per 15-minute episode of the show when it began in the fifties . This included a £21 appearance fee and a £5 payment - £550 in today’s money - for ‘provision of materials’ including photographs and diagrams which were used in the broadcast. Moore had been fascinated by astronomy from the age of six after picking up a book on the subject belonging to his mother. By the age of 11, Moore was elected to the British Astronomical Association - 50 years later, he would become its president. Royal Astronomical Society spokesman Peter Bond has previously told that The Sky at Night had inspired a generation of astronomers. ‘Just about everybody who’s involved with astronomy started out thanks to Patrick - he’s a kind of figurehead for astronomy in this country,’ he said. ‘I bought my first astronomy book in the 1950s and it was written by Patrick - I think The Sky At Night had just started at that time.’","BBC confirmed that discussions are currently ongoing over show's future .

"The best footballers on the planet had the chance to earn up to $1million each for playing in an exhibition match at the end of the season, only for the project to be vetoed by their clubs. The idea was for an annual Europe v Rest of the World game to be staged at the Amsterdam Arena and modelled on basketball’s NBA All-star Game. The plans were advanced enough for there to be confidence last Christmas that the top-secret project would go ahead. The finances were said to stack up, helped considerably by massive Chinese sponsorship, while TV rights were well advanced. Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and Sergio Aguero could both have been involved in the All-Star game . Chelsea star Diego Costa was another name who super agent Jorge Mendes could have invited to play . Super agent Jorge Mendes was involved, suggesting his stable of Cristiano Ronaldo, Diego Costa, Angel di Maria, Sergio Aguero, James Rodriquez and Radamel Falcao would have been willing participants. Club managers, such as another Mendes client Jose Mourinho, would not have taken charge of the two sides to avoid conflict. National team bosses would have been hired. There would have been a sliding scale for fees but certainly Ronaldo would have been in the top seven-figure bracket. However, the major obstacle was the crowded football calendar and the clubs, who would have been paid as well, finally vetoed the all-star game at the January meeting of the European Club Association. The clubs had also wanted a bigger share of the proceeds. Robert Bonnier, risk-taking city financier who made and then lost a fortune during the first dotcom bubble, was another well-known name connected with the aborted match. Angel di Maria could have been involved and earned up to $1million with the rest of the players . Super agent Mendes would also have tried to get his client Radamel Falcao involved in the All-Star game . BT Sport ambassador Jose Mourinho will escape censure from the network after he chose arch rivals Sky’s Goals on Sunday for his 27-minute diatribe on referee Martin Atkinson. The grey area of Mourinho’s contract with BT allows him to appear on rival channels — aside from routine managerial commitments — when the club insist. Chelsea say Mourinho’s Sky showing was a joint decision made after the 1-1 draw with Burnley. BT are more annoyed with Mourinho’s representatives for letting it happen than Jose himself.

No wonder the FA have such a low opinion of FIFA when they are provocative enough to include Thailand’s Worawi Makudi as a member of their delegation at the rules-deciding International FA Board summit in Belfast tomorrow. FIFA executive member Makudi, who is being investigated by the ethics committee for breaches of the World Cup bidding code, probably has the most acrimonious relationship with the FA of any Zurich powerbroker. After the 2018 World Cup election fiasco, a proposed friendly international between England and Thailand, set up in anticipation of Makudi supporting England’s bid, was called off. And Makudi took legal action against former FA chairman Lord Triesman for alleging, under parliamentary privilege, that Makudi wanted the TV rights to that game. FIFA say Makudi was chosen by the Asian Football Confederation, whose choice it was on a rotational basis.

Aido Vallelado, 27, said she struggled to believe it when she first saw the colour of the two dogs . Molina, who breeds hunting dogs with her father Manuel Vallelado, 52, in the Spanish town of Laguna de Duero, said her father had called the puppies the Hulk pups, and joked that she should not get them angry. The male puppy is now gradually beginning to lose his colouring. Vet Daniel Valverde is now looking into the cause of death of the female puppy and the dogs' colour. He said: 'There are no other recorded cases of this happening in Spanish scientific literature. I am carrying out virological and bacteriological tests to try and find an answer.' The two Spanish puppies however are not the first reported examples of green pups. In 2012, MailOnline reported on a green Labrador puppy born in Clayon-le-Moors, Lancashire.

Naomi Grimes and Kyle Murray's two-year-old golden Labrador, Buttons, gave birth to a litter of eight - but the couple were shocked when the second in the litter came out with an unusual green glow. The other seven puppies were born - during the 28-hour labour - with normal golden coats. The cause for the colouring at that time was given as exposure to a substance called biliverdin, which can be found in the placenta.","Dog breeder Aido Vallelado said she struggled to believe it when she saw the colour of the two puppies .

'Tragically I don't think Kev realises the one person who fought tooth and nail to keep him in the side is the one person he is now assassinating: Matt Prior. 'Kevin has been quite clever because the guys still playing he has left alone and he hopes to get back in again one day. He has picked on people who he thinks can't answer back. If that (bullying) was the case a lot of people would have flagged it up before.

"The distance from the Grosvenor Hotel to the Dorchester Hotel is less than half a mile. The last time we met for dinner, Harry Redknapp had to get a taxi. He started off with the best intentions for a short stroll, but retired hurt no more than 50 yards down Park Lane. This was before his left knee went, too. Back then, it was just the right that had him in agony. His condition has deteriorated greatly. Harry Redknapp quit QPR on Tuesday with the club second bottom of the Premier League . Redknapp says his knee problem was the main reason why he had to quit QPR as he could no longer walk . Redknapp outside his home in Dorset . On several occasions over the last two years, Redknapp has considered resigning from football management. He misses the hands-on engagement of coaching, he misses getting out onto the training field as he used to. He still scouts games, but it's a chore. He has to make plans for staircases, for distant car parks; if he's on the wrong side of the stadium, it can take him 20 minutes to get to his seat. Sooner or later, something had to give. He quit Queens Park Rangers on Tuesday, after being told he would need replacements for both right and left knees. Unable to walk even 100 yards, he accepted he was not the man to lead Rangers into their relegation fight. And he called owner Tony Fernandes in the small hours to deliver the news, shortly before sharing the decision with his son, Jamie. 'I was awake all night, thinking about it,' Redknapp told me. 'I'm struggling so badly now. I can't walk, I can barely stand and watch. I'm in pain all the time. I've been putting it off, and putting it off, but it has got to the stage where I cannot do the job. 'I booked a ticket for Fulham's FA Cup game with Sunderland on Tuesday night, but my first thought was, ""how am I going to get to the ground?"" Even if I get a car park pass there is going to be some walking. I can't walk around Craven Cottage anymore, I can't walk down the street – that's how bad it has got. 'I went to see my grandson play football at the weekend, and after five minutes had to go back to the car. I couldn't even stand up. What sort of life is it if you can't watch the kids play? That sort of made my mind up. 'I went to bed thinking I would sleep on it, but then I couldn't sleep a wink. That's when I decided to call Tony. It must have been 5.30am. I just told him he needed someone who could properly coach and manage the team in the next ten weeks. It's such an important time. They need someone who can give it everything.' Redknapp says he had a good relationship with QPR owner Tony Fernandes . Harry Redknapp guided QPR back to the Premier League at the first attempt via the play-offs . Redknapp says Emmanuel Adebayor was his only transfer target on deadline day - but he was too expensive . Redknapp's resignation immediately brought speculation that he had become frustrated at a lack of activity in the transfer window. Rangers face financial fair play restrictions, and a huge fine, and have been working to cut budgets. Yet he insisted this was not the case. 'I haven't got the hump, we haven't had a row,' said Redknapp. 'I knew some while ago that we were not going to be able to get much done in January. 'We had one real target on the last day, Emmanuel Adebayor, because we are short upfront. But he was too much money. I accept that. There are no hard feelings on my part – I've not had a problem with Tony Fernandes in all my time there. 'I even went to training this [Tuesday] morning because it was my intention to say goodbye to the lads. I went to sort out some bits and pieces with the club and by the time I had finished they were gone. It's been that quick. I just made my mind up because events were piling up. Being told I needed both knees replaced was a huge blow. It would put me out of the game for months because you can't have them done together. 'Steve McClaren called me when he heard the news and we were talking about our time together at Rangers last year. He reminded me that I was on crutches for 10 weeks back then. It's been a problem for too long now. 'I know what people think - that I've been sacked, or stormed off because we couldn't get the players in. 'My son Jamie said that my timing has to be the worst in the world. When I look back on my career, it certainly isn't my strong point - but I can't control what people think. I feel positive about the future at Rangers - Sandro is back at the weekend and he will make a huge difference. We've got other players coming back from injury, too - if I could get out and coach them like I could five years ago, I'd be optimistic. But I can't.' Redknapp and QPR have not won a single point away from home this season . His wife, Sandra, broke a knee cap too, before Christmas, stumbling over the vacuum cleaner. He regrets not being at home more to tend to her and you can sense a desire to be closer to home. 'I was totally honest with Tony. I told him he needed someone who could commit to every aspect of the job in the next ten weeks, and that's not me. I still don't think I'm finished with football. When I've had the operations, I'll be looking for work again, I know that. I can't imagine my life without it. But right now, I've got to make my health the priority. 'I can't even walk the dogs. I stand watching the team play, and I'm struggling. It's reached a point where I can't ignore it any longer. It's not a decision I would take lightly. I've thought about it a few times this season, but have always decided to give it one last go. 'The last week has been the tipping point. I can barely move and I'm not enjoying my life. I need to get this done as quickly as I can and try to move on. Nigel Pearson at Leicester City told me had a knee replacement and was ready to go again after six weeks. I'm not sure I'll be hopping about in that time, but I'll talk to Andy Williams, my surgeon, and we'll work out a plan.'

"A father is outraged after going to watch his son's soccer game against a rival high school and seeing his son's mugshot on the t-shirts of the opposing team. Father Kevin Rittenhouse was shocked to see his son, Alex Rittenhouse's, mugshot not just on the t-shirts of students at Marion High School on September 3 but on adults as well.

Kevin Rittenhouse  told reporters that his son got into legal trouble last year after being caught with marijuana. Following the incident, Alex was forced to transfer from Marion High School to Oak Hill High School after becoming victim to vicious cyberbullying. I was shocked first, then I thought, ‘How did they get this picture?’ Because I never even seen the picture,' father Kevin Rittenhouse told Fox. The victim's aunt, Kelly Chastain, is also disappointed with the school's handling of the situation and she believes that relatives should have been notified prior to attending the game.

It’s appalling,” Chastain added vehemently. Rittenhouse said that the shirts were rivalry taken one-step too far.

His son was first tormented by his peers after police confiscated his phone and were able to identify other culprits involved in the marijuana incident. Students began teasing him on social media sites and calling him a narc, reports Theindychannel.com. 'Maybe if they (thought they) were being funny, you know, but that’s not the right kind of funny. … They want to brush it off like nothing happened and I think people need to know,' Rittenhouse said. Patricia Gibson, a spokesperson for Marion High School said that the school was 'disappointed' about the bullying and says that students were told to remove the t-shirts. 'In addition, school administrators took a proactive stance at the time of the games, turning people who were wearing the shirts away at the gate,' Gibson said in a statement. 'No one was allowed into the stadium with one of the shirts visible.' The school said that students were not allowed to wear t-shirts at the school nor were they allowed to wear it at the game. 'It is a disappointing situation. Administrators have spoken directly with family members to try to resolve their concerns, and would be happy to discuss the situation further if they address their continued concerns directly to us,' said the school in a written statement.

"After catching an octopus, holidaymaker Labros Hydras followed local tradition by killing it and taking it to a taverna to be served for his supper. That is when he discovered this was no ordinary specimen – it was a ‘hexapus’ with only six legs instead of the usual eight. The creature found during a snorkelling trip in Greece is believed to be only the second recorded worldwide. Catch: Labros Hydras his daughter Areti, ten, and son Arion, six admire the six legged octopus or hexapus which they found while on holiday in Greece . Fishing: The specimen was pulled from the sea by US citizen Labros Hydras as he went snorkelling in Greece . Hexapus: The chef refused to cook it for him but he fried it himself and served it with tomato and lemon . Father-of-two Mr Hydras, 49, took it to a local taverner where a chef cooked it and served it with tomato, lemon and a lettuce leaf. It was only then that he checked with a friend who is a biologist – and felt sick at what he had done. The first known hexapus was found off North Wales in 2008 and taken to Blackpool Sea Life Centre. Nicknamed Henry, he was then released back into the sea where he has . probably died of natural causes as their maximum life span is five . years. A repentant Mr Hydras said: ‘It tasted just like a normal octopus but now I feel really bad. ‘When we caught it, there was nothing to suggest it was any different or had been damaged. Net: The chef told Labros he should have let the octopus live because it was so rare . The unfortunate moment that Labros Hydras' son Arion (left) killed the six legged octopus (right) Beach: Labros finishes off the rare hexapus while his daughter Areti and son Arion watch . ‘I thought it had been born with six tentacles. We go to Greece every . year and when we catch an octopus, we do the same thing so we just did . not think about it. ‘I wanted to find out more, but there was no internet where we were. I . then called my friend who is a biologist and he told me it was true and I . was horrified.’ Mr Hydras, who was born in Greece but is now a US . citizen living in Washington DC, caught the hexapus with his daughter . Areti, ten, and son Arion, six, off the Pelion peninsula. The mechanical engineer has given details to the Hellenic  Centre for . Marine Research in Athens to increase awareness of the wild hexapus. Tentacles: it was only the second hexapus ever found, the first being in Wales . Holiday: The family inspect the hexapus before killing and eating it . ‘It is the least that I can do given my ignorance and guilt that I feel . for killing such a rare  animal,’ he said. Biologists said the hexapus . is the result of a natal abnormality in a common octopus (octopus . vulgaris), not a new species. Professor Matt Bentley, a marine biology expert at Newcastle University, said: ‘It is rare to find an octopus like this. ‘There is every possibility it could have grown an abnormality in early development. ‘There is nothing to suggest it is a different species. Another explanation is it could have been injured and healed over time.’ Day out: The family travel to Greece every year and frequently catch and cook wild octopi . Catch of the day: Labros's son Arion holds the six legged octopus or hexapus . Henry the Hexapus was found in 2008 . Henry was found off the coast of North Wales in 2008 in a lobster pot and was the first six-tentacled octopus found. He was named after King Henry VIII, who had six wives. He was held at Blackpool Sea Life Centre, northern England, and was an attraction in an exhibit named Suckers. It is thought that his tentacles are a result of a natural abnormality, and he was not involved in an accident. After being taken from the sea, he was transferred to the Anglesey Sea Zoo, Wales, which, in turn, donated him to the Blackpool Centre. He is thought to have been the first of his kind. The Centre's displays supervisor Carey Duckhouse said at the time: 'We've scoured the internet and talked to lots of other aquariums and no-one has ever heard of another case of a [hexapus].'","Labros Hydras pulled the hexapus from the sea when snorkelling in Greece .

"An auto shop worker has built an upside down truck that looks like a flipped-over vehicle. Rick Sullivan spent six months and $6,000 building the upside down truck from the parts of two separate vehicles in the car workshop he runs in Clinton, Illinois. The road-legal car is created from a 1991 Ford Ranger pickup truck with a 1995 F-150 pickup truck body placed over the top - but upside down with the wheels pointed towards the sky. Rick Sullivan designed the upside down truck from the parts of two separate vehicles, a 1991 Ford Ranger pickup truck with a 1995 F-150 pickup truck, in the workshop he runs with his wife Kathy in Clinton, Illinois . Mr Sullivan says when he first saw a Ford on its roof in his garage he thought it would be interesting on the road . It is designed to look like a red and white Ford pickup truck knocked on to its roof - complete with spinning tyres and a license plate that reads 'FLIPOVR'. Mr Sullivan and his wife Kathy run a collision centre in  Illinois where he built the creation. He got the idea for the subverted truck when he was called to transport an overturned Ford Ranger to his body shop. When he saw the Ford on its roof with four wheels sticking up in the air, he thought it would look interesting travelling down the road. Mr Sullivan said: 'I built the truck by starting out collecting parts for a Ford F150, we bought different parts in different locations. The bare bones of Rick Sullivan's pickup truck (pictured) which forms half of the unusual vehicle he designed . The 1991 Ford Ranger pickup truck (pictured below) is joined with the 1995 F-150 body placed on top (above) 'Then on the drive train it is a 91 Ford Ranger that I bought complete. We tore the body off of it and transformed the F150 upside down on to the 91 Ford Ranger.' The vehicle attracts attention wherever it goes, causing drivers to stare and pedestrians to stop in the road. Mr Sullivan estimated that a thousand pictures of the car are taken every day it is on the road. Mr Sullivan is out on the road in Clinton with his dog Murray and the 'FLIPOVER' license plate is clearly seen . Mr Sullivan pulls over the unusualy upturned pick-up truck - which he says causes people to stop in the street . 'There's no blueprint - I just started buying parts and then putting it together. 'It's all in my head and we had to make adjustments throughout, but it turned out pretty much like I envisioned it. 'People are amazed, it's one of those things when you first see it, it's hard to recognise what it is but when you take the second look then they want to pull me over and take a closer look at it.' Mr Sullivan didn't tell his wife Kathy he was building the truck until it was finished - when he took it to the dealership where she works to surprise her. Ms Sullivan said: 'He just showed up at my job and called me to come outside. I went outside and saw this incredible creation. 'People were stopping in the street and it was a lot of fun. 'Rick is car crazy and his mind is always thinking about what the next project is going to be.'","Rick Sullivan spent six months and $6,000 to build his 'topsy turvy' truck .

No one can doubt the good effects it has on the human body. It is a divine gift from God.' Followers like Gupta, however, insist that urine from every cow cannot be beneficial. 'The cow, whose urine one has to drink, should be a virgin - she must not have delivered a calf. Also, the urine is to be collected just before sunrise - that urine has the best effect,' he said. However, there are people who oppose the claims made by preachers. 'People keep saying all kinds of things about cow urine, but we don't mind. People don't know what this is. They have never experienced the taste of cow urine or its effects, so how can they judge it,' Singhal said. 'It is just a matter of time before people realise the utility of cow urine.' He is now eyeing to cash in on the growing trend and has plans to start manufacturing cow urine products on a commercial scale. 'We can manufacture eye drops, medicines for stomach ailments, toothpaste, bathing soaps, herbal powdered medicine, among other things, from cow urine,' he said.

Brendan Rodgers did not want to expose Raheem Sterling to the coarse climes of Sunderland, where temperatures barely touched 3C and wild winds whipped litter around the stadium. Instead, the player he believes will fire Liverpool to the top four was in Jamaica, relaxing and posting selfies amid the 30C surrounds of his ‘winter break’. Rodgers has made an exception with Sterling, allowing him to enjoy a 10-day rest period while his team-mates have negotiated an FA Cup tie at League Two AFC Wimbledon and a narrow victory at Sunderland. Brendan Rodgers believes Raheem Sterling will make the difference to Liverpool's season . Captain Steven Gerrard (left) celebrates Lazar Markovic's winner in the 1-0 defeat of Sunderland . Sterling was given an extended winter break in Jamaica from where he posted this selfie on Instagram . Sunderland have won just once at the Stadium of Light all season and have the worst home record (nine points) in the Premier League. But the Reds boss sees the 20-year-old as an exceptional talent, and one which will make the difference in his side’s quest for Champions League football. ‘Raheem was brilliant in the second half of last season. If we put him and (Daniel) Sturridge in that team now, with that way of working, it will be fantastic,’ said Rodgers, whose side have lost just one in nine in the Premier League and are up to eighth. ‘We are aiming for the top four, absolutely.’ Sterling was back on Merseyside on, and Rodgers will be expecting the England forward to reward him for keeping to the promise he made in the summer. ‘After the World Cup I felt he needed a break but we had the Champions League and a lot of games,’ he explained. ‘We had a plan that this was going to be the best time, after the Christmas period. ‘He will come back now and mentality it will freshen him up. It is not just the physical fitness but the mental fitness that he needs. ‘We have put so much on him since he came into the team as a 17-year-old. He has not had a break and has progressed through to being a full international player.’ Rodgers insists that Sterling needed a rest to avoid being burnt out by the end of the season . Sterling scored four goals at the start of the season but has only netted once since September 27th . Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher backs decision to give Raheem Sterling a rest . It was perhaps best for sorry Sunderland that Sterling was not at the Stadium of Light. For the crisp packets and sweet wrappers did not distract from the rubbish they served up on the pitch, especially during the first half. It was easy for Liverpool. The only surprise was that they did not add to Lazar Markovic’s ninth-minute opener, a close-range poke after a forceful burst into the penalty area. Emerging as the match-winner, however, at least afforded the Serb the headlines which will be hoped serve as a confidence boost. The 20-year-old has struggled to impact since his £20million arrival from Benfica, but Rodgers said: ‘He is a top young talent. It shows more what a difficult league this is for any player to come in, let alone a very young player. Then add the fact that he is coming to one of the biggest clubs in the world, so it takes time. ‘But a lot of our young players are starting to bed into our philosophy and the way we play. You will see them develop and come on a lot in the next six months.’ He added: ‘I had a chat with Lazar a while ago about his aggression and he got sent off in the next game. But I want him to be aggressive with and without the ball. He is a talent which is why he is at Liverpool and his performance was very good.’ Markovic (left) is starting to find his feet after a struggling start to his Anfield career . Liverpool's win at the Stadium of Light has taken Liverpool to within five points of the top four . The same cannot be said about the hosts, whose display was lacking in energy and invention. They were arguably better after Liam Bridcutt was sent off early in the second half following a soft second booking for a trip on Emre Can, but they never truly threatened parity. Poyet is frustrated that his team are not playing out the identity he has tried to impose and was alarmed at the manner in which they stood off the visitors. When asked about their lack of urgency and aggression, he said: ‘Only one Sunderland team has shown those characteristics – the team of Kevin Phillips and Quinn. ‘The rest of the teams of Sunderland did not have any characteristics. They were rubbish. They were playing for relegation and suffering. I am trying something. But we are miles away to a point that it worries me a little bit.’ Worry, however, is not an emotion troubling Rodgers right now. Rather, his mood on a windswept and chilly Wearside was one of excitement. Liverpool’s season might just be hotting up.

"Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has ruled out joining a Premier League club before he retires from football. The 33-year-old, who has played in Sweden, Holland, Italy, Spain and France, has often been linked with big money switches to England but a move has failed to materialise. Now in his third season with PSG, Ibrahimovic insists he wants to stay with the Ligue 1 champions and will never ply his trade in the Premier League. PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, pictured in action against Ajax, says he won't move to a Premier League club . Ibrahimovic, pictured in action against the Republic of Ireland, continues to represent Sweden . The 33-year-old insists he is happy with the French champions and has no plans to move to England . Clubs: Malmo, Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona, AC Milan, Paris Saint-Germain . Total club appearances: 432 . Total club goals: 250 . International caps: 100 . International goals: 50 . Honours: Eredivisie title (twice), Serie A title (four times), La Liga title (twice), Ligue 1 title (twice) Asked whether he'll represent an English club in the future in an interview with The Guardian, the former Barcelona forward said: 'No. I am happy in Paris. I respect the Premier League. 'It's one of the best in the world and no other league has this media interest. But I'm happy I've played in so many different leagues.' The Sweden striker had a trial with Arsenal while playing for his local club Malmo as a youngster but, having complete confidence in his own ability, was left unimpressed with having to try and earn a deal with Arsene Wenger's side. Ibrahimovic said: 'Today, Wenger says it was a misunderstanding. But I didn't like being asked to prove myself. I know I'm good enough. I don't need to show it to you. Either you know who I am or you don't. 'I remember being in Wenger's office and you could tell he was the boss. It was Wenger! But I don't think I was so close [to signing].

For me he has a lot of hunger when he plays. I think he's good for the team,' he said. Unfortunately for the rest of Roy Hodgson's squad, the ex-Juventus star is less familiar with England's other players. He added: 'The rest? I cannot judge them because I don't know them.'

"The best side I ever faced were Arsenal’s Invincibles. They had quality all over the pitch, they were powerful and they hardly had any weaknesses. Now Chelsea are starting to look just as strong. I don’t know if Jose Mourinho’s team can go unbeaten, but when you look through the squad they have so many options in every position. If you want a war with them, they are up for the fight. If they want to open up the game, they’ve got the pace and skill of Eden Hazard and his midfield mates. And if they want to sit and play on the counter, they’ve got the speed and power of Diego Costa. Diego Costa, here celebrating scoring Chelsea's second goal against Arsenal, has speed and power to burn . And Eden Hazard (right), bought down here for a penalty against Arsenal, epitomises their pace and skill . Hazard calmly puts aways the penalty conceded by Gunners defender Laurent Koscielny . Cesc Fabregas has struck up a deadly partnership with Diego Costa. He has already set up FOUR of the striker’s NINE goals in the league. He does not look like a man nursing a hamstring injury and his goal showed in a split second what Chelsea are about. Cesc Fabregas picked the ball up like a quarterback in the pocket and sprayed an inch-perfect pass to Costa. Everyone knows what a powerhouse he is, but that finish showed he really does have everything. It was the kind of cute scoop you’d expect from a midfield maestro, not a ferocious forward like Costa. Costa's finish for Chelsea's second goal against Arsenal showed the finesse of a midfield maestro . Chelsea are starting to resemble Arsene Wenger's (right) Invincibles of 2003-04, which included superstars such as Thierry Henry (left) and Patrick Viera (centre), here in north London with the Premier League trophy . Vieira was captain of a team with hardly any weaknesses, much like the current Chelsea side . Henry, Robert Pires (second right) and Dennis Bergkamp (right) were important players for many seasons . Adam Lallana, starting to make a mark at Liverpool, celebrates his goal against West Brom on Saturday . LIFT OFF FOR LALLANA . When I was at Southampton at the end of my career, I remember seeing a young Adam Lallana play. The focus was on Gareth Bale and Theo Walcott but you could see his quality. But he was such a well-mannered lad you wondered if he had the drive to really kick on. After playing for England and getting his move to Liverpool, it’s obvious that he does. Now after such a quality goal, which our graphic below shows, he will feel more settled. He’s not blessed with blistering pace but he’s so good with both feet and can drop a shoulder to find space. Now he has to go on and dominate games like he can. IS YAYA BACK? HE NEVER LEFT! You could name an entire XI of top quality players who are suffering from a World Cup hangover, but Yaya Toure has been getting more stick than most. He has not hit top gear yet — a bit like Man City — but I expect that goal against Villa to get the big man well and truly back into his stride. Of course there’s room for improvement but he’s got so much quality and we’ve still not seen him ping in a free-kick or penalty yet. Don’t worry about Yaya, there’s plenty more to come. Could this Yaya Toure goal for Manchester City against Aston Villa be the catalyst for a return to his best form? TIME FOR SWANS TO BECOME LIONS . The way Wayne Routledge and Nathan Dyer are playing, they are making it very difficult for Roy Hodgson not to pick them for England. They are scoring and making goals and offer so much pace out wide. Routledge scored a classy goal a few weeks ago and again against Newcastle while Dyer buzzes around causing teams problems. Roy Hodgson has already called up their team-mate Jonjo Shelvey. Maybe the two Swansea wingers are next up. Swansea City's Wayne Routledge scores another classy goal for Swansea on Saturday against Newcastle . Swans Nathan Dyer, taking on Newcastle's Gabriel Obertan, has been causing havoc for defences . UNITED NEED WORK, BUT NOT IN GOAL . Manchester United have a few things to sort out in their defence, but their goalkeeper is not one of them. David De Gea was excellent against Everton and his saves towards the end won his team the game. When I first saw him playing for United he looked six stone wet through. There was barely anything of him and I always thought he wouldn’t be strong enough to make it. David de Gea won the game for Manchester United over Everton with some incredible saves . Teams bullied him by whipping in crosses and packing the box to make life as uncomfortable as possible. He learnt from those experiences and he has improved dramatically. Now he takes total command of his area and is easily one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League. United still have a lot of work to do defensively, though. As good as De Gea is, they can’t keep asking him to produce world-class saves. He saved the day against Everton, but for United there is plenty of work to be done. Man United manager Louis van Gaal's terrific keeper just papers over the cracks in his inadequate defence . HAMMERS' TIDY TRANSFERS . West Ham did some good business in the transfer window but one signing who came in a bit under the radar was Aaron Cresswell. He’s made the step up from Ipswich but already looks so comfortable in a West Ham shirt. I came from a lower level at Bournemouth so know how difficult that transition can be, but he has made it look easy. He plays with confidence, is good on the ball and he’s got a fine left foot, something every club is looking for. At 24 he might be a late developer, but he has made a solid start. Aaron Cresswell (right), challenged here by QPR's Charlie Austin, has impressed since his move from Ipswich . In their last three campaigns only one Sunderland player has scored 10 or more goals - STEVEN FLETCHER . Steven Fletcher celebrates one of his two goals against Stoke in Sunderland's big 3-1 win . FLETCHER MUST KEEP FIRING . That 3-1 victory over Stoke is a huge result for Sunderland. Gus Poyet has been waiting a long time for a win and they badly needed it. Part of the problem has been a lack of goals and that’s because they lack a real out-and-out goalscorer. When I look at their squad the only natural goalscorer I see is Steven Fletcher. He has always shown a lot of potential but has never quite been consistent enough. The two goals on Saturday should give him the confidence he needs to go on and become his team’s go-to man for goals.","Arsenal's Invincibles hardly had weaknesses, much like today's Chelsea .
Jose Mourinho has the luxury of so many options in every position .
They're both up for war or can open teams up with finesse and speed .
It's time for Adam Lallana to go on and dominate game like I know he can .
There is plenty more to come from Yaya Toure after Aston Villa goal .
Swansea's Wayne Routledge and Nathan Dyer must be England contenders .

'As soon as a new dirty turtle came into the cleaning station, all the fish abandoned the one they were on, and go for the newcomer. 'Obviously the dirtier, the better. On a typical day, during a 60 minute dive, more than dozen a turtles come in and out. 'After the fish leave, many turtles find a ledge or overhang nearby and fall asleep for another 20 minutes or so. 'But some leave the station as soon as the cleaning gets done. After the clean is completed, many of the turtles find a nearby ledge or overhang where they rest for awhile . 'For me, the key for the ultimate turtle cleaning picture was to get these yellow tang, Zebrasoma flavescens, in the frame. 'These yellow fish are the most beautiful but they are the most shy fish in the ocean. 'I had to approach very quietly without blowing bubbles and was lucky with these fish on this particular day, who were bold - that doesn't happen often.'

"Queens Park Rangers caretaker manager Chris Ramsey would be delighted if the club were to appoint Tim Sherwood as Harry Redknapp's replacement. Redknapp quit the Barclays Premier League's second-bottom side earlier this week citing problems with his knees, and Sherwood has been touted as his successor with an appointment expected next week. The squad were put through their paces on Friday morning as Ramsey and director of football Les Ferdinand took training ahead of Saturday's Premier League clash with high-flying Southampton.

Ferdinand shares a joke with QPR midfielder Joey Barton at the club's training ground . Former striker Ferdinand was appointed to his new role earlier this week but took a hands-on approach with the coaching staff at the session. Ramsey, who takes charge of Saturday's game  alongside Kevin Bond, worked under Sherwood at Tottenham last season – and says he would welcome the 46-year-old's expected arrival at Loftus Road. 'We're good friends outside football,' said Ramsey, who admitted he had spoken to Sherwood since Redknapp's sudden departure. 'He gave me an opportunity last year along with Tottenham to coach in the Premier League so yeah, I'd be well happy working with him and I think he's very good at what he does.' QPR's 3-1 loss to Stoke City last Saturday proved to be Harry Redknapp's last game at the helm . Following Harry Redknapp's resignation, Tim Sherwood has emerged as the front-runner for the QPR job . 67-year-old Redknapp has left QPR, citing forthcoming knee surgery as the reason behind his decision . QPR caretaker manager Chris Ramsey speaks to the media at the Harlington Sports Ground on Thursday . Comparing the situation at QPR to his time with Sherwood at Tottenham, Ramsey said: 'This is a slightly different challenge but at the end of the day it's still about getting players to buy into what the clubs trying to achieve. 'The players really need to step up now and achieve what they are capable of. For anyone that comes in it would be a fantastic job.' Ramsey said earlier this week that the squad would be issued with a 'clean slate' under his temporary management – and that seems to include Adel Taarabt, who made just two starts this season under Redknapp. 'Most of the players are fit and almost everybody will be available,' Ramsey said.","Harry Redknapp quit his role as manager of QPR on Tuesday .

"Queens Park Rangers have opened talks with Tim Sherwood over becoming their next manager. Harry Redknapp left Loftus Road on Tuesday, citing the fact he requires two knee operations as the reason behind his decision. And Sherwood is understood to be the preferred choice of Les Ferdinand, who has been given a new role as director of football by chairman Tony Fernandes. Former Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood has opened talks with QPR as the club seek a new manager . Sherwood, with Les Ferdinand on the Spurs bench in 2014, is the favourite to take over from Harry Redknapp . Redknapp resigned on Tuesday, claiming that his decision was because he needs surgery on his knees . Queens Park Rangers have failed to pick up a single point in their 11 matches away from Loftus Road . Initial talks have taken place regarding the former Spurs manager taking control at QPR, and if discussions prove successful Sherwood could be in situ for the weekend. Ferdinand had been placed in temporary charge of the first-team along with coach Chris Ramsey but the club have now confirmed that Kevin Bond and Ramsey will take control until further notice. Joe Jordan, who was also part of Redknapp's backroom staff, has left the club. Bond is hopeful of staying at the club in some capacity and held a meeting with Ferdinand, who wants him to be part of the new set-up, on Tuesday night to discuss a role. The departure of coach Glenn Hoddle, who was understood to be a contender to replace Redknapp, has cleared the path for Sherwood to resume his management career at Loftus Road. The pair do not see eye-to-eye in a feud that stems back to when Sherwood played under Hoddle at Spurs in the early 2000s. However, Fernandes still needs to rubber-stamp the club's move for Sherwood, something that is said not to be a formality yet. The QPR chairman tweeted on Wednesday: 'We the board will hire someone who cares, thinks long term, wants to be involved in developing the academy, has coaching skills, will play young players and is a winner. 'The names that fans are mentioning to me are names that we are going to consider. I would say 3 interview will e (sic) done. All fan feedback has been taken in.

And Glenn and Joe. 'Our players have sent me many positive messages and are ready for the fight. That strong spirt is immense for me. Come on you rsss.' Sherwood has been out of work since leaving Tottenham last summer, although he has been in contention for jobs at Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion. Ferdinand was appointed head of football operations at QPR in October and was soon followed on to the staff by Ramsey in a role on the club's academy. Ferdinand and Ramsey worked together at Tottenham last season as assistants to Sherwood when he took over from Andre Villas-Boas at White Hart Lane. Sherwood, who was sacked by Tottenham at the end of last season, needed special dispensation from the Premier League to operate as a manager at Spurs because he did not have the UEFA Pro Licence required to do the job. He had to enrol for the first available course and is midway through it with the Football Association of Wales. It will be completed later this year. Ferdinand will now be responsible for overseeing the entire football department at QPR, which means he is likely to have a say in the appointment of a new manager.

QPR chairman Tony Fernandes (left) has appointed Ferdinand (right) as QPR's new director of football . Former Spurs midfielder Sherwood worked as a coach under Redknapp at Tottenham before becoming boss . After handing the former Hoops striker his new role, chairman Fernandes said in a statement: 'I've been really impressed with the job Les has done in his short time here and as such I am keen for his role to evolve, with the clear mandate of assisting us in developing and evolving the footballing department, from the academy to the first team. 'This is a new strategy for us. Our recruitment policy at QPR is changing. The recent addition of Ryan Manning to the Elite Development Squad is a sign of what we will be trying to do here. 'We want to develop a philosophy of buying young, hungry players, who can go on to forge decent careers with us.' Tony Fernandes has confirmed Les Ferdinand has been handed a new role as Director of Football at QPR. R's legend Ferdinand, who re-joined the club in October in the position of Head of Football Operations, will now be responsible for overseeing the entire footballing department at Loftus Road, with a mandate of building for the future. The 48-year-old has already made significant improvements to the footballing philosophy of the club since his return – and the Board are now keen for him to have more of a hands-on role at all levels, particularly in the field of recruitment, working closely with the First Team. Fernandes told www.qpr.co.uk: 'I've been really impressed with the job Les has done in his short time here and as such I am keen for his role to evolve, with the clear mandate of assisting us in developing and evolving the footballing department, from the Academy to the First Team. 'This is a new strategy for us. Our recruitment policy at QPR is changing. The recent addition of Ryan Manning to the Elite Development Squad is a sign of what we will be trying to do here. 'We want to develop a philosophy of buying young, hungry players, who can go on to forge decent careers with us.' He added: 'I've had many messages from supporters, of all ages, who aren't – for one reason or another – satisfied with what's going on at QPR at the moment, but I can reassure all Rangers fans that we are putting the building blocks in place to move things in the right direction for the future. 'We've made a number of mistakes in the transfer market over the last few years and it's something we want to change. We don't want to be a buying club – we want to nurture young talent and build a young, ambitious team. 'Premier League survival is our priority in the short term, but in the medium and long term we want to make sure everything is in place, from the Academy upwards, to create a culture and philosophy within the club that QPR fans can be proud of. 'Les bleeds blue and white and working closely with the First Team and Academy management, particularly in recruitment, he is going to play a key role in moving us forward over the coming months and years.' Ferdinand, of course, flourished for QPR following a move from Hayes in 1987, and the former England front-man, after completing his Governance Course a St George's Park – backed by the PFA and FA – recently, is relishing his latest challenge. 'Everyone knows what this club means to me and if anything the last few months have only enhanced the feelings I have for QPR,' he said. 'Working closely with Tony and the Board, I can assure QPR fans that they are desperate to create a lasting legacy at Loftus Road and the role of Director of Football will be hugely important in terms of where we want to take this club in the future. 'Some of the management courses I've taken over the last few years were with a role like this in mind, so I couldn't be more delighted.'","Harry Redknapp resigned as QPR manager on Tuesday morning .

Following a lengthy police surveillance operation, five gang members were sentenced to more than 15 years in prison for burglary, theft and handling stolen goods offences. Judge Angela Morris said as she sentenced the gang: 'This was, by any view, a professional, well organised operation and on occasions ambitious to the point of being brazen. 'Offences were motivated by one thing and one thing only - greed.' The gang first came to the attention of police last March following a string of high-end car and motorbike thefts in west and south London and their surrounding areas, Reading Crown Court was told. Racing fan: Former Boyzone star Shane Lynch part-owned the custom-built 200mph car - worth £50,000 - along with his racing team Japspeed . Daniel O’Keefe, 31, and 28-year-old John Davis were among motor racing fans who attended a public event on June 11 at the Santa Pod Raceway, near Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, where the Subaru Impreza was stolen. The car, which is not road legal, was custom-built for the motorsport of 'drifting' in which cars perform controlled slides around a track. The vehicle, being driven by the pair, was filmed by motor racing fans driving on the M1, M25 and M4 motorway just hours after it was taken. News of the high powered racing car’s disappearance quickly spread over internet forums and a major car hunt was launched with the racing team offering a £10,000 reward. O’Keefe, Davies, and a third gang . member, Cary Grant, aged 24 years, took the stolen vehicle to the home . of mechanic and second-hand parts seller Peter Ballantyne in Windsor, . Berkshire. The gang members were captured on CCTV at Ballantyne’s home with the stolen racing car. Japspeed . driver Stephen Biagioni later received a call from the 40-year-old . Ballantyne initially demanding £5,000 to provide information relating to . the whereabouts of the car. He claimed that the vehicle was already being stripped and broken up for parts. Ballantyne . arranged to meet the driver and - unbeknown to him the police - at an . M4 petrol station and then led officers to the vehicle park near his . sister’s home in Holyport, Berkshire. The Impreza was undamaged but had been stripped of its bumper, rear spoiler and rear lights as well as identifying stickers. Charles . Evans, prosecuting, told the court that in the six months the police . were trailing the gang they stole high performance vehicles and . motorbikes to the value of £231,900. In one raid seven bikes with a combined value of £90,000 were taken following a reconnaissance mission on a garage. It was not known how long the gang had been operating before they came to the attention of officers. News of the high powered racing car's disappearance quickly spread over internet forums and a major hunt was launched with the racing team offering a £10,000 pounds reward . Mr Evans said: 'They were a group of young men who often worked in pairs, twos or threes, and sometimes alone committing offences. 'They all had the technical know-how and the ability to do this and it was a case of if they became aware of a motorcycle or car, they would go and take it. 'There was not a chain of command insomuch as they were all in it together.' Police used CCTV footage, mobile phone analysis and surveillance to trap the members of the gang. On sentencing seven members of the gang Judge Morris, sitting at Reading Crown Court, said: 'This was a large scale operation involving all of these defendants at various times in burglary, theft, transport and or disposal of stolen high end motor vehicles and bikes. 'In some cases the vehicles were recovered. Most were not, or what was found was a burnt out write off. 'There is no doubt that this enterprise was well organised and bold.' Craig Wells, 22, of West Drayton, admitted handling stolen goods, theft, and burglary, and was jailed for a total of 40 months. Daniel O’Keefe, 31, formerly of Uxbridge, pleaded guilty to theft, handling stolen goods and burglary and was jailed for five years. John Davis, 28, of Datchet, Berkshire, admitted theft and handling stolen goods and was sentenced to five years imprisonment. Cary Grant, 24, of George Green, Buckinghamshire, pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods and was jailed for 18 months. Peter Ballantyne, 40, of Windsor, admitted handling stolen goods and was jailed for 15 months. Sumeet Kale, 28, of Northolt, pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods and received 12 months in prison but this was suspended for two years. He was also ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work, be subjected to a night time curfew and pay £250 pounds costs. Daniel Pope, 22, of Uxbridge, admitted handling stolen goods and was sentenced to six months imprisonment suspended for 12 months. He was also ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid work and be subjected to a curfew.","Thieves were caught on camera racing pop star's Subaru on the motorway .

"After what had been a difficult start to his tenure at Manchester United, Louis van Gaal could have reflected on beating Everton 2-1 with some satisfaction. His team had climbed into the  Premier League’s top four and they had done so thanks to a first United goal for Radamel Falcao. But Van Gaal looked as deflated as the punctured tyre that disrupted his departure from the training ground a few days earlier — and understandably so. VIDEO Scroll down for Louis van Gaal's thoughts on David de Gea's performance . Louis van Gaal leaves the Old Trafford pitch on Sunday after his side narrowly beat Everton 2-1 . The Dutch manager (right) knows his team's leaky defence must improve after another uncertain display . Luke Shaw (left) gave away a needless penalty against the Toffees and was unconvincing at left back . He knew his side owed too much to the brilliance of David de Gea, as well as the profligacy of Leighton Baines from the penalty spot. Just as he knew a team attacking with more confidence would have exploited what remains an alarming imbalance in his side. He is trying to address the issue with his calls for a more collective approach to defending, and for 45 minutes of an entertaining match he probably felt his players were pretty much following his instructions. But when only West Bromwich Albion now stand between back-to-back encounters with Chelsea and Manchester City, significant progress still needs to be made. Van Gaal's side might well have drawn or even lost against Everton were it not for  David de Gea's heroics . United are scoring plenty of goals, with Radamel Falcao opening his account against Roberto Martinez's side, but it's defensively where there are concerns . ‘We have to improve a lot of things,’ was one of the first statements the Dutchman made in a series of post-match interviews, even if he did then offer a more positive spin when he suggested the fact that they had risen to fourth playing badly was a cause for optimism. But his initial point was correct because United need to improve on an awful lot, in particular across a back four that remains alarmingly fragile. This was only Luke Shaw’s second competitive appearance for United but he managed to demonstrate the best and worst aspects of his game in the 70 minutes he played prior to leaving the field with a knee injury. Tyler Blackett and Marcos Rojo have played well at times but both struggled in the 5-3 defeat by Leicester . If Shaw  oozed class going forward, he proved such a liability in defence that it was easy to see why Roy Hodgson would rather see him back in England’s Under 21 squad for now. It was not just the penalty he conceded; a reckless challenge on Tony Hibbert. It was a general lack of composure whenever Everton attacked down his flank and the role he played — albeit a minor one compared to Rafael — in allowing Steven Naismith to score his 55th-minute equaliser. Shaw would do well to study his predecessors because, in Denis Irwin and Patrice Evra, United have had two left backs who mastered both aspects of a full back’s job; who were brilliantly effective going forward but were also key members of a superbly organised back four. Van Gaal's defence has been weakened further by the absence of the injured Jonny Evans . Paddy McNair (right) has impressed this season but is yet to be tested against the league's best strikers . Shaw is still young, of course. Talented, too. But it is a concern when good defending relies so much on instinct and he will need to show he can be trusted if he wants to remain in the side once players like Jonny Evans are fit. Particularly when Van Gaal still has the option of Marcos Rojo, however much that might alarm United supporters haunted by his efforts at left back earlier this season. A more accurate measure of United’s strengths and weaknesses will come at home to Chelsea and away to City. Excellent on debut last week, Paddy McNair did a fine job in dealing with the physical presence of Romelu Lukaku on Sunday. United take on Chelsea and Manchester City in two of their next three matches and need to be more solid . But Lukaku is not of the quality of forwards McNair could soon be facing and that’s where the issue of collective responsibility became more of a pressing concern for Van Gaal. United’s back four needs to operate with more cohesion but it needs more protection, too, as the runs from deep by Leon Osman and Bryan Oviedo late in this game illustrated. Nobody was picking up Everton’s substitutes and, had it not been for De Gea, their efforts could have been extremely costly for the hosts. Angel Di Maria's terrific form since joining from Real Madrid has given the Old Trafford club a big lift . Going forward, United are terrific; as good as any team in the Premier League and so blessed with quality that the absence of the suspended Wayne Rooney caused little disruption. Angel di Maria continues to thrill and Falcao is starting to prove himself quite the predator with a fine demonstration of forward play crowned by his winning goal. But Van Gaal was not getting carried away, with his focus afterwards more on Di Maria’s defending than the goal and the assist he produced. Mainly because United’s manager knows what is coming next.","Louis van Gaal must improve Manchester United's defence .

"Harry Redknapp endured plenty of frustrating days as Queens Park Rangers manager but his final one in charge was among the most challenging. The 67-year-old quit after being told he needs knee replacements but maybe the decision would have been even harder had transfer deadline day at Loftus Road been more productive. Redknapp knew his squad needed bolstering to drag themselves out of the relegation zone. It is why he wanted to sign Tottenham’s Emmanuel Adebayor, the striker he worked with in his previous job at Spurs. Harry Redknapp quit QPR on Tuesday with the club second bottom of the Premier League . Redknapp says his knee problem was the main reason why he had to quit QPR as he could no longer walk . QPR were keen to sign Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor on loan but couldn't afford his wages . QPR’s transfer spend since Redknapp took the managerial reins - at least £12million more than any other club outside the Premier League’s current top seven teams. Rangers were so desperate to land the Togolese on loan they offered to pay three-quarters of his £100,000-per-week salary. But Adebayor made it clear on Monday morning that he had no intention of swapping life at White Hart Lane for a relegation battle. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy was happy to do a deal with QPR but when Adebayor turned down the move Rangers, Levy then refused to let him go to West Ham, who offered to pay only 50 per cent of his salary. QPR then turned their attentions to a swap deal that would have seen Mauro Zarate, only recently signed on loan from West Ham, return to Upton Park with Matt Jarvis heading in the other direction. Redknapp was excited about signing Jarvis, telling Sky Sports News of his desire to do the swap. A deal was agreed but it collapsed minutes before the deadline because of a rule that stipulates a club cannot send back a loan player in the same window. The fact club officials, led by head of football operations Les Ferdinand, dedicated a considerable amount of time to the deal is believed to have understandably infuriated Redknapp, who found it hard to comprehend that QPR’s deal-makers were unaware of the rule. QPR only signed Mauro Zarate (left) on loan during January's transfer window, but he has made little impact . QPR were keen to sign Zarate's West Ham team-mate Matt Jarvis (right) but failed to finalise a deal . It meant Rangers’ only signing January signing was Zarate, a player Redknapp no longer wanted. Since his arrival in January, Zarate played just 14 minutes of football. And despite the club’s efforts to strengthen the squad, their lack of money – due to self-imposed financial constraints as they look to comply with Financial Fair Play regulations – meant Redknapp was left with a virtually identical squad. Redknapp’s relationship with co-owner Tony Fernandes - who has been forced to spend considerable time away from the club in recent weeks due to the recent Air Asia tragedy - has always been amicable, but the businessman was not willing to spend much money on Monday, tweeting: ‘No more cheque book. We have good players. Bought all players the manager asked for in summer. Our players are not mercenaries. Good guys. If something interesting comes up we will look at it. But I’m not optimistic. Given the right motivation, tactics and coaching we can achieve much more.’. The arrival of Ferdinand, now one of the frontrunners for the job, is also said to have altered the atmosphere and dynamic at the club’s Harlington HQ. Redknapp (left) says he had a good relationship with QPR owner Tony Fernandes . Harry Redknapp guided QPR back to the Premier League at the first attempt via the play-offs . Redknapp holds aloft the Championship play-off trophy after they defeated Derby County last season . Players arrived at the club’s west London HQ on Tuesday unaware of what was to come, despite the fact Redknapp had already made his decision and told those closest to him in the morning. As is often the case, Redknapp didn’t take the session because of his health, leaving that task to his trusted right-hand man Kevin Bond. But Redknapp was there, overseeing training – having his say at regular intervals. After the ball-work session, players made their way into gym for a 45 minute weights session, before heading into the showers. Then Redknapp was gone. His assistants Glenn Hoddle and Joe Jordan followed last night. As players emerged from the showers they were confronted with whispers. Many of them didn’t believe it at first given Redknapp’s normal demeanour earlier in the morning. Les Ferdinand (right) is currently taking charge of QPR alongside fellow coach Chris Ramsey . Former Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood is among the early favourites to replace Redknapp at QPR . The players were shocked but they knew his knees had been troubling him. Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey have been handed the reins for the time being, but who will be entrusted with replacing Redknapp on a permanent basis? Tim Sherwood seems the logical choice. His old Spurs pals Ferdinand and Ramsey would certainly vouch for him. Likewise, the feeling amongst the QPR squad is that it is Sherwood’s job to turn down.","Harry Redknapp resigned as QPR manager on Tuesday .

"The number of malnutrition cases in England has soared in the past five tears as poorer families struggle to afford food in the recession. The amount of malnutrition admissions to NHS hospitals has seen a significant spike, with last year 5,499 cases being recorded. Admissions were almost double compared to the figure in 2008, when just 3,161 people were treated in English hospitals for malnutrition. More than half a million people across Britain have turned to food banks to stave off hunger . The shocking rise has been blamed on the economic downturn, with Jim Cunningham, Labour MP for Coventry South, who claimed the revealed a 'map of how the economic situation of the past five years has affected people', The Independent reported. Mr Cunningham acquired the figures, which were released by health minister Norman Lamb, in a written answer to a parliamentary question. The figures were obtained from the Health and Social Care Information Centre and were collected by primary care trusts, the Manchester Evening News reported. Figures from the Health and Social . Care Information Centre show that the number of cases of rickets - a . disease of poverty associated with vitamin D deficiency - have also . dramatically risen, from 561 in 2008/09 to 702 in the past year. More . than half a million people across Britain have turned to food banks to . stave off hunger, according to charities speaking in September. Damning figures come after a review has been promised into hospital food, following concerns that a third of vulnerable patients are not being given enough help at meal times . Easington MP Grahame Morris, who sits . on the House of Commons health select committee, told the Chronicle that . the figures should be an alarm bell. He . said: 'I certainly think the Government’s policies on austerity with . cuts in public services and welfare benefits have been a contributory . factor. 'I suspect, . with increasing fuel bills, many low-income households in the North . East, especially older people, are having to choose between heating and . eating.' Malnutrition is a common health problem, with about 3 million people estimated to be malnourished in the UK at any time. Around a third of people admitted to hospital or care homes in the UK are found to be malnourished or at risk of malnourishment. Malnutrition is caused by either an inadequate diet or a problem absorbing nutrients from food. There are a variety of factors that cause it, including having reduced mobility, a long-term health condition or a low income. Symptoms of malnutrition include weak muscles, feeling constantly tired, low mood and an increase in illnesses or infections . A doctor should be consulted if your body mass index (BMI) is lower than 18.5 or you experience the symptoms listed above. The main treatment for people diagnosed with malnutrition is dietary changes. Source: NHS . Ministers have previously argued that a surge in demand has in part been fuelled by jobcentre staff being allowed to refer the unemployed to food banks for help. Cuts to benefits, frozen or falling wages and rising living costs have been blamed in part for some people struggling to make ends meet. The figures come as the Archbishop of Canterbury has urged Christmas shoppers to give money to Britain’s expanding network of food banks rather than splash out on expensive presents. The Most Reverend Justin Welby made the appeal in reaction to news of a shocking increase in the number of impoverished Britons now relying on food handouts. With the number of those receiving basic supplies trebling over the past year to 350,000, he said it would be ‘wonderful’ if people gave a tenth of their festive shopping budget to their local food bank this Christmas. The Archbishop also warned cash-strapped shoppers to beware of overspending and plunging themselves into debt. He said: ‘I am not a Scrooge. But what I would say to people is, be sane about it. ‘Don’t overstretch yourself and end up with an enormous debt hangover.’ The damning figures come after a review has been promised into hospital food, following concerns that a third of vulnerable patients are not being given enough help at meal times. Many are too frail even to open cling-film or cardboard packaging and are left struggling as nursing staff move on to the next bed. Without the necessary assistance, they risk malnutrition and dehydration, say charities. Ministers are also concerned at the high cost of waste as 30million uneaten meals are thrown away annually. It is feared many dishes consist of recipes that elderly patients would not normally eat, like Thai curry. The Government and Age UK have now vowed to carry out a major review of hospital food, with national standards issued by next summer. Relatives have told how previously sprightly patients have become emaciated and lifeless on wards because they are either too frail to eat or just cannot face the meals. Those with dementia, arthritis or poor sight are often left grappling with tricky wrapping and difficult to open sandwich packets or simply struggling to hold paper cups.","Just 3,161 people  treated in English hospitals for malnutrition in 2008 .

Although London and Los Angeles remain frighteningly bad for congestion and are among the top 10 worst offenders, Milan, Italy, took top spot. Traffic data organisation INRIX used archived data to create a ranking of the worst cities and countries for traffic congestion. It also as detailed the average number of hours spent waiting in traffic at each centre. Drivers in London waste a staggering 83.4 hours a year in traffic - the worst of the top 25 cities. Those in Los Angeles waste a slightly less shocking  64.3. Drivers in Milan - the city ranked overall as the worst - only lose 57 hours a year. INRIX used a detailed formula to produce its data that involved comparing a 'free flowing' speed on a particular segment of road to real time traffic speeds taken during peak hours. Wasted driving minutes were created by placing wasted minutes in traffic against estimated typical trip lengths and the average number of trips taken each year. In its findings, INRIX said after seven years of only 'modest' congestion, its 2013 report showed it was the same offenders topping the list. 'Simply put, it appears that congestion acted like a magnet - where it existed, it had a tendency to attract disproportionately more of it. 'Traffic is back on the rise in 2013, even in countries showing continued declines. Traffic congestion was up in six of the 15 countries analyzed: the U.S., UK, Ireland, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Italy.' And it is not good news for European drivers, with traffic congestion rising for the first time in two years. 'With traffic congestion increasing at 3 times the rate of employment, 10‐day long traffic jams like we've seen in China and the 2-3 hour daily commutes that are part of daily life for people in Sao Paolo, Brazil, today could become the reality for drivers in Europe and North America in the not so distant future.'

"Nearly 200 patients due to undergo surgery at a brand-new flagship PFI hospital have had their operations cancelled before it even opens its doors. Problems with the air conditioning at the new Southmead Hospital in Bristol mean it will be a month until regular operations can take place there. North Bristol NHS said adjustments needed to be made to a 'high-tech air flow system' which helps to eliminate infection risks. Teething problems: Nearly 200 operations at the £430million, PFI-financed Southmead Hospital, Bristol,  ave been postponed after managers admitted problems with the 'high-tech air flow system' The new hospital was funded by £430million of private cash. It is costing taxpayers £37million a year in repayments and site maintenance under a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract. A spokesman has claimed that patients were being transferred to the new hospital according to a phased process, that fewer operations were expected, and that emergency surgery was unaffected. But despite the claims that everything was proceeding more or less according to plan, there have been anecdotal reports that the surgical schedule at Southmead is in fact in disarray. one patient told the Bristol Post that she had arrived for a spinal operation appointment at 7am earlier this week and was left to wait on a bed in a corridor until 11am. Only then was she told that the operating theatres were not ready and she finally was sent home at 1.30pm. She claimed that parts of the building where she was waiting looked unfinished, with wires hanging from the ceilings and builders still tidying up. North Bristol NHS admitted it had put back 180 operations. Medical director Chris Burton said: 'We only reschedule operations when it is absolutely necessary and apologise to any patients who have been affected. 'Anyone who has been affected has been personally contacted to inform them of the changes to their operation. 'There was always going to be a phased process in opening the new theatres and fewer planned operations were scheduled for this period. 'We have continued to use operating theatres in the old Southmead and Frenchay Hospitals as the move has taken place to minimise the impact whilst getting the new theatres open.' He added: 'Technical adjustments needed to be made to the high-tech air flow system in the theatres, which have been incorporated to eliminate infection risks now and in the future.' The new 'super hospital' is supposed to bring services from Frenchay and Southmead hospitals together on one site for the first time. Touted by Lloyds Bank as a 'showcase development', it combines more than 800 acute beds and 24 operating theatres with a new accident and emergency department over a 24.8-hectare site. Carillion handed North Bristol NHS the keys to the new building in March and it had been expected to be fully open to patients by this coming Wednesday. A spokesman would not comment on claims that building work was unfinished. Mr Burton insisted that urgent surgery was still being carried out in the new building as needed. 'We expect the remaining theatres to be open for planned surgery next week,' he told the Bristol Post.

Hospital workers launched balloons and left farewell messages as their final night shift ended in the early hours of last Monday morning. The casualty department - which opened in the 1960s - was designed to cope with around 35,000 people a year, but in recently years had been dealing with as many as 100,000 annual patients.","Private Finance Initiative-funded hospital was due to be fully open this week .

"A woman dubbed the 'neighbor from hell' has hit back at the family who say she terrorized them, claiming that she was the one being bullied and that the husband wanted to have an affair with her. Lori Christensen, 50, from Minnesota, became notorious in 2012 for allegedly targeting her neighbors without good reason. Police received more than 100 calls about her behavior which ranged from lewd gestures, abusive handwritten signs and one bizarre faux striptease. Scroll down for video . Sentenced: Lori Christensen, 50, pictured, was sentenced to five years' probation on Monday for harassing the family nextdoor . Temper tantrum: Christensen defended herself in an ABC News interview in September and lost her temper at the interviewer . Fighting back: Christensen claimed to ABC News last month that her neighbor Greg Hoffman wanted to have an affair with her . Speaking to ABC's 20/20, aired on Friday, she insists that her trouble with Greg and Kim Hoffman stems from their jealousy of her and because 'Greg wants to have a relationship with me'. 'I had no interest in that at all,' Christensen added. Even as the interview took place, Christensen was seen off-camera losing her temper and boiling over into a tirade of curses. The Hoffmans began filming their neighbor in action when the taunting became unbearable. They . caught her performing a lewd dance - unbuttoning her clothes and . revealing her legs - as their son celebrated his 12th birthday. She also allegedly told the boy that he was the 'son of an alcoholic' in front of his friends. Lewd: The neighbor appeared in front of her house on a regular basis to make rude gestures towards the people who lived across the street . Defiance: The 50-year-old said she was an assertive person who could hold her own . Aggressive gestures: The woman pinned these signs to her garage door but said they were not always directed towards the Hoffmans . She . also pasted as many as 50 signs to her garage reading: 'Get a life', . 'the guilty talk the loudest' and 'I saw mommy kissing a breathalyzer' - . a reference to the fact Mrs Hoffman is a recovering alcoholic. Other accusations include making masturbatory gestures to Greg Hoffman and shouting: 'I wish you'd died' to his wife. She told ABC she is not remorseful for saying this after Kim's relapse - when she spent time in hospital after a mixture of alcohol and prescription drugs. 'Why? Because that's was where she . was headed,' she said. 'She was the scotch drinker, not I.' The giant signs that covered her . garage, Christensen said, were not always directed at the Hoffmans and . maintains it was her first amendment right to post them. Accused: After leaving the Ramsey County Court House, Lori Christensen, left, tries to hide from the media by using a white sheet of paper in St. Paul, Minnesota . When asked if she thought her 'striptease' was bizarre, she shot back that she thought it more bizarre that Mr Hoffman would film her and her daughter. Her actions have cost her her government job, landed her in jail twice and got her barred from returning to her home and neighborhood. But, she insists, she is not sorry for what she did and calls the subsequent events simply as 'speed bumps' in her life. 'Why do I have to live my life to make them happy?' Christensen asked. 'They sat at home every day on their front step watching me and my . daughter. I'm assertive. I hold my own. But I'm also a very compassionate person. I've always been happy. I love life.' The 50-year-old pleaded guilty in July to a felony charge for . willfully falling foul of a harassment restraining order brought in May . 2012. Greg Hoffman (left) and his wife Kim have had to endure years of taunting from Christensen and were relived when she was ordered to stay 10 miles away from them . Relief: Christensen reserved much of her outrageous behavior for the Hoffman's children (pictured). Their son was called 'the son of an alcoholic' in front of his friends, the family claimed . Two . felony charges were dropped as part of a plea deal that . included, ten-years probation, a ten-year no-contact order with the . Hoffmans and a ten-year exclusion from the neighborhood. In the interview Christensen claimed not to care about being kept away from her home describing her old neighborhood as 'ghetto' and 'low-class'. Last week, she tried to withdraw her guilty plea on the charges of violating a restraining order. The judge refused her request and a jury will now determine her sentence. 'It’s been a long road and just to have this behind us is so big,' said Greg Hoffman. 'It has been very difficult for our family and very difficult for the whole neighborhood,' Kim Hoffman said. 'It was unfair.' The Hoffmans say the plea agreement, even without jail time, is fair. Hellish: Christensen agreed to a plea deal that includes, 10-years probation, a 10-year no-contact order with the Hoffmans and a 10-year exclusion from the neighborhood . 'We’ve . never been out for blood. It’s just been we wanted our own freedoms . back and for her to understand and take responsibility for her actions,' Kim said. The Hoffmans moved to Homewood Place 16 years ago, and Christensen moved three years later. Their . daughters played together until Christensen's daughter poured nail . polish on one of the Hoffman girls about five years ago. When Greg Hoffman went to tell Christensen about it, she yelled at him to take care of his own children. Inappropriate: The family filmed Christensen performing a lewd dance and unbuttoning her clothes opposite their home as their son celebrated his 12th birthday party . He told the Minnesota Star Tribune: . 'I said, ""Lori, you may intimidate everyone else, but you don't . intimidate us"". Those were the last words we spoke to her for two . years.' Then in 2009, after . Kim Hoffman was recovering from a hospital visit following a mixture of . prescription drugs and alcohol, she caught Christensen screaming at her . children and pulled them away. Christensen shouted: 'Why didn't you have a little more Scotch? I wish you had died,' according to court documents. Police . Chief Lynne Bankes told the Minnesota Star Tribune he was stunned at . the level of abuse, which appears to be entirely one-side. Neighbour from hell: An elderly woman who lived next door to Christensen's home, pictured, reportedly moved out as she could not handle her behaviour . 'In . my 35 years as a police officer, I have never met or heard of anybody . who is so persistent in their negative behavior toward their neighbors - . or anyone,' she said. However Christensen claims that the sheriff did not like her and once called her a 'b****'. Over . the past two years, Christensen was charged repeatedly for . violating harassment restraining orders obtained by the Hoffmans. Intimidating: They also filmed signs that read: 'Get a life you stalking freak' and 'the guilty talk the loudest' It . is not just the Hoffmans who have complained of abuse. One next-door . neighbour has a court order forbidding Christensen from having any . contact with her or her young daughter. An elderly woman who lived on the other side moved as she no longer could stand the woman's behavior, Bankes said.

"Aaron Lennon has been in the headlines following his deadline-day move to Everton for failing to smile while posing with his new side's shirt. Toffees boss Roberto Martinez has blamed the photographer for failing to ensure Lennon looked happy to have sealed a move to Goodison Park. Here, Sportsmail photographer Kevin Quigley gives us his view. 'I blame the photographer… It's his job to make him smile. I'll chase the photographer,' joked Everton manager Roberto Martinez on Aaron Lennon’s unveiling pictures. Fair enough, photography is an art. Everyone has their own eye and perception is each to their own. That said, I know Peter Byrne and I am sure if you asked him if he was pleased with that set of pictures he wouldn’t say, ‘Yes, that is the best work I have ever done!’ Having said that, he has not messed a job up, he has not over or under exposed his work (sorry, photography talk for making them too light or too dark), he has not created a blurry image. Aaron Lennon looks glum as he is presented as an Everton player after signing on loan from Tottenham . Roberto Martinez joked that it was the photographer's job to make Lennon smile for the pictures . Lennon took to Twitter to poke fun at the pictures and insists that he is 'buzzing' to be at Everton . Sportsmail's Kevin Quigley says the photographer is not to blame for Lennon looking grumpy . He has simply failed to capture what every fan wants to see from their new signing which is for them to be happy to play for you, which should be the brief. How this could have come about I can’t answer. I have had many footballers that have said, 'No, I am not doing that', or 'Does this make me look stupid?' Most recently, for a group of rugby players, I wanted to re-create the famous picture from Manchester United’s ‘Class of 92’ to which I got: ‘Do you think we are a boy band?’ Fortunately enough, this created a laugh amongst the lads which saved me from the awkward situation that Peter has been dealt with in this job, someone that does not want their picture taken and therefore does not smile. It is the job to make someone smile, but unlike other Barclays Premier League clubs such as Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal to name a few, Everton do not have a club photographer that deals with this stuff. They sub contract their stuff out via the Press Association which has many staff photographers, meaning anyone could turn up on the day. Sportsmail photographer Kevin Quigley recently photographed five Saracens stars . Lennon has previously looked glum during his time at parent side Tottenham . Clubs with staff photographers who deal with the players and staff every day build up a rapport and trust with the individuals and can therefore do more exciting pictures. That’s difficult anyway when you just need to show them in a kit or holding a scarf. Peter no doubt got a call that the Everton media team wanted him there as soon as possible. Upon arrival, I am guessing Peter would have been given the warm welcome of 'you haven't got long with him'. That’s what I get nearly every time I turn up to a club to do a feature with a player. In that time he would have been given a player that is either in a rush before training or has just finished and has loads of other media activity to do, and maybe told ‘Can you quickly go and do some pictures', in a tone of voice meaning ‘This doesn’t really matter…’ Very few people like their pictures taken, I’m guessing Lennon is the same. No doubt a club official was present for this shoot, so why did they not ensure that their new player was smiling? The 27-year-old, pictured with Teemu Tanio, Paul Stalteri, Martin Jol, Tom Huddlestone and Wayne Routledge, did not look too pleased when he joined Tottenham in 2005 . I did some digging after I saw these pictures and spoke to a friend of Lennon's to ask if was unhappy about the move. His friend laughed when I sent them the pics and said 'Azza just chills, he looks happy but the pics are killing him, he’s just chilled - he is buzzing about the move'. So if this is the case and he was, why does he look so sad? Well, I googled 'Aaron Lennon pictures', in three different Tottenham photo calls he has the same expression... he certainly did not hate Tottenham or was unhappy to be there. Also, lifting an award at Leeds he doesn’t exactly smile either - he has some previous when it comes to 'the smile.'","Aaron Lennon sealed a deadline-day move to Everton from Tottenham .

"Yaya Toure, Angel di Maria and Adam Lallana may have done enough to feature in this week's top 10, but a two-goal performance from Sunderland's Steven Fletcher means the Scottish striker sails to the top of EA Sports' Player Performance Index PPI chart. Here, EA Sports crunch the numbers to reveal the 10 best Premier League performers from the weekend. Sunderland striker Steven Fletcher tops the charts but who else makes the top 10? Steven Fletcher takes the top spot after a two-goal performance for Sunderland against Stoke . 10. Wilfried Bony, Swansea (PPI score: 37.6) The Swansea striker has had a mixed start to the Premier League season in a Swansea shirt, but proved his worth once again with a low finish to put his team in the lead against Newcastle on Saturday afternoon. The Ivorian striker saw three of his attempts hit the target as he led Swansea's line at the Liberty Stadium. The EA Sports PPI is the official player rating index of the  Premier League. It measures a player's contribution to the success of his team. The intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses. So, what are the six indices? 1. Winning performance . 2. Player's performance per match . 3. Appearances . 4. Goals scored . 5. Assists . 6. Clean sheets . 9. Yaya Toure, Man City (PPI score: 41.6) Many have questioned Toure's performances this season, but the big midfielder stepped up when Manchester City need him most and provided a crucial goal which gave his side a 1-0 lead after 82 minutes. Toure kept his side ticking with a total of 128 accurate passes as City looked to break down a spirited defensive display from Paul Lambert's side. 8. Jordan Henderson, Liverpool (PPI score: 42.0) Henderson continued his run of fine form in a Liverpool shirt with a winning goal and brilliant performance for Liverpool against West Brom on Saturday. The Reds had taken the lead through Adam Lallana before a Saido Berahino penalty pulled the Baggies level in the 56th minute. The England midfielder struck just five minutes later to cap a showing that included an 88.5 per cent pass completion rate. Jordan Henderson completed 88.5 per cent of his passes and scored Liverpool's winning goal . 7. Riyad Mahrez (PPI score: 42.1) The Algerian midfielder managed three dribbles, one cross and an assist during a star performance as Leicester battled to a 2-2 draw with Burnley. Mahrez forced Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton into an impressive save in the 20th minute before crossing for Jeff Schlupp in the first half. 6. Christian Eriksen (PPI score: 42.2) The Danish midfielder helped Tottenham to record their first home win August 24 after his fine strike put his side into a 1-0 lead after 40 minutes. Eriksen carved out four crosses while seeing one of his two attempts on target hit the back of the net. Christian Eriksen (left) scored Tottenham's only goal as they defeated Southampton on Sunday . 5. Connor Wickham, Sunderland (PPI score: 43.9) The Sunderland youngster impressed as Sunderland strolled to victory against Stoke. Wickham may not have been able to get on the scoresheet, but he did just enough for a top five spot after four attempted dribbles. 4. Adam Lallana (PPI score: 44.3) The Liverpool new boy scored his first Liverpool goal on the stroke of half-time to put his side ahead against West Brom on Saturday. The former Southampton midfielder completed 82.9 per cent of his passes as he drove Liverpool onto an important 2-1 at Anfield. Adam Lallana scored his first goal in a Liverpool shirt and finished fourth in this week's charts . 3. Angel di Maria (PPI score: 50.3) Angel di Maria continued to impress since his big money move to Old Trafford with another Manchester United goal. Di Maria put Louis van Gaal's side ahead against Everton in the 27th minute whilst making a whopping 10 crosses as United ran out 2-1 winners. 2. Papiss Cisse (PPI score: 51.3) If Alan Pardew manages to keep his job as Newcastle manager, there's no doubt striker Papiss Cisse will deserve a huge pat on the back from the under-fire boss. Cisse saved Pardew's side from defeat for the second time this season with another point-saving brace. Cisse scored twice from just three attempts on target as the Magpies draw 2-2 with Swansea. Angel di Maria continued his fine run of form with a goalscoring performance against Everton . 1. Steven Fletcher (PPI score: 61.0) Sunderland striker Fletcher tops this week's PPI charts as his double helped Sunderland to an impressive 3-1 win against Stoke. Not happy with scoring two goals from his two shots on target, Fletcher also did his bit for the defence as he won three of his tackles. Scottish striker Fletcher scored twice to help Sunderland to a 3-1 win against Stoke .

"Looking at these pictures of Harvey the kitten, you’d think he was distinctly uncomfortable. But this is actually the best way for the four-month-old rescue cat to get around – and he’s perfectly happy with it. He was born with bones missing from his front legs, but that has been no handicap for the youngster, who has instead learned to walk on his ‘elbows’ and even move along on his back legs. Scroll down for video . Floppy feline: Four month old rescue kitten Harvey was born with bones missing from his two front legs . Resourceful: Harvey's foster carer says the kitten's rare condition doesn't slow it down . Harvey, who has a rare condition . called radial agenesis, was spotted when his owner put him up for sale . on the online advertising site Gumtree. An X-ray revealed that Harvey’s ulna and radius bones, which connect the upper half of his front legs to his paws, were missing. He is now waiting for an operation to replace the bones with metal pins thanks to the efforts of animal charity Cats Protection. Cruel: The kitten, which suffers with radial agenesis, had been listed for sale on the advertising website Gumtree by its cruel former owner . Operation: Harvey is missing the bones that connect the upper half of the front legs to the paws, but is due to have metal pins fitted as a replacement thanks to animal charity Cats Protection . In the meantime he is enjoying . life at the home of his ‘foster carer’ Liz McCulloch, 50, who said: . ‘He’s a lovely little thing. ‘Because Harvey was born that way he . doesn’t know there’s anything wrong with him so he runs around on his . elbows and happily plays with my other cat and dog. ‘He’s OK at the moment but if he doesn’t get the operation he’ll start to damage his spine when he gets bigger.’ A well-wisher acquired Harvey from Gumtree in November and handed him in at a Cats Protection branch in Glasgow. Purr-fect future: The rescue kitten with 'foster owner' Liz McCulloch, who says she has never seen a cat with a condition like Harvey's . 'Lovely little thing': Harvey is being looked after by Liz McCulloch, who has been fostering cats for 25 years . Workers, who thought he had simply . been born with dislocated legs, took him to a vet, where the X-ray . revealed he had radial agenesis, which occurs when an animal’s leg bones . fail to develop. The condition can be corrected by . implanting metal pins between the paw and upper bone, but an operation . can be carried out only on cats over six months old to give the existing . bones time to harden and take the weight of the pins. Cats Protection has raised more than . £3,000 in only three days so Harvey can have the life-changing operation . when he is six months old. Rare condition: Only four cats have been born with radial agenesis in Scotland in the past 30 years . Lorraine Currie, co-ordinator of Cats . Protection’s Glasgow branch, said: ‘A friend of the branch spotted him . on Gumtree. It said in the advert he had two broken legs but when she . got there he had no bones at all. She felt sorry for him and took him . home but it became clear he needed a lot of treatment and that’s when we . got involved. ‘Once Harvey has had the operation, his future looks very bright.’ A spokesman for Gumtree, which lets . sellers post adverts for free,  said: ‘We have a very strict policy . regarding the sale of sick or injured animals on the website. ‘We apologise that someone was able . to post an advert for Harvey despite him having medical problems and we . will do our best to make sure similar incidents do not occur in the . future.’","Harvey the kitten has managed to learn to walk despite being born with bones missing from its front legs .

"Remember Mario Balotelli's camouflaged Bentley? Well, AC Milan midfielder Sulley Muntari has followed in his former team-mate's footsteps with a camoulaged creation of his own. In a picture posted by Michael Essien on Instagram, the former Chelsea player sits on his Milan team-mates bonnet, showing a Lamborghini with a design very similar to that of Balotelli. Muntari and Balotelli spent a year in each other's company at AC Milan between 2013-2014, before Balotelli left to join Liverpool, and it seems the latter's taste rubbed off on his colleague. Michael Essien's Instagram post shows Sulley Muntari's garish camouflaged Lamborghini . Sulley Muntari celebrates after scoring AC Milan's opening goal in their game against Chievo Verona . Muntari kisses the turf after his goal put Milan 1-0 up at the San Siro stadium on Saturday evening . The Lamborghini is believed to cost between £150,000 and £200,000, an amount that Muntari's €3 million a year contract can easily stretch to. AC Milan have started the season with two wins, two draws and a loss, and currently sit fifth in Serie A. Their only loss came against table-topping Juventus, whose 3-2 victory over Roma at the weekend ensured their 100 per cent record so far this season is still intact.

"Harry Redknapp resigned as QPR manager on Tuesday - citing his imminent knee operations as the main reason for his departure. Redknapp leaves the club second bottom of the Premier League after a fruitless foray in the January transfer window. Rangers only signed West Ham's Mauro Zarate on loan, as they were restricted to make big money moves. Below, Sportsmail's Nick Harris assesses the club financial plight. Harry Redknapp quit QPR on Tuesday with the club second bottom of the Premier League . Redknapp says he had a good relationship with QPR owner Tony Fernandes during his time at the club . Harry Redknapp’s last day saw frustrations in the transfer market. Why was that? Owner Tony Fernandes’ tweet on Monday suggested he he did not want to spend any money. ‘No more cheque book. We have good players. Bought all the players manager asked for in summer.’ But QPR were previously big spenders, no? Yes, they spent about £71m on transfers fees since 2012 with players such as Christopher Samba, Loic Remy, Jermaine Jenas and Benoit Assou-Ekotto on big wages too. The club made a financial loss of £65m in 2012-13 and their losses last season as they got promoted are expected to be revealed as £40m to £50m, when the club eventually declare them. That announcement hasn’t been made yet as QPR lock legal horns with the Football League. QPR paid a then club-record £8million to sign Loic Remy from Marseille in January 2013 . What’s that all about? Football League financial fair play rules limit the losses clubs can make in the Championship. QPR’s losses last season were so big it is expected they’ll face a £30m-plus fine from the League. If they get relegated, they’ll have to pay up, or risk being denied entry back into the Championship. They are taking legal advice.

"The men's final of the Australian Open between Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic was disrupted by a group of protesters against the Manus Island immigration detention facility on Sunday. Wearing t-shirts with slogans such as 'Shut down Manus' and 'Australia open for refugees', the political activists made their presence known during the second set and descended on to the Rod Laver Arena's centre court.

"One pregnant woman in labor from Illinois knew she wasn't going to be able to make it in the hospital in time so she delivered the baby all by herself as her husband drove them to the nearest hospital. Beth Farina was on her way with her husband Trevor to Sherman Hospital on Tuesday when she started going into labor. She said she could feel the baby coming when they were at least a mile away from the emergency room. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Beth Farina delivered her own baby while her husband drove her to the hospital . Baby Tobias is in great health and Beth says she'll have a story to tell him once he gets older . 'When we got on the Tollway, I knew we were not going to make it to the hospital. I was like, ""This baby is coming, you better drive faster,""' Beth Farina told NBC. Beth, who is studying to be a nurse, was able to successfully deliver her third child Tobias when she was in a moving car on the way the hospital. 'She told me she feels like we need to push, and I said, 'The best I can do right now is pull over and call 911,' and she told me to keep going,' Trevor Farina told reporters. Farina says that during labor she was on the phone with 911 who gave her instructions following the birth of her baby boy. 'I waited for the next contraction, pushed him out, pulled him up onto my chest,' said Beth. Beth's husband said he couldn't do much else but drive his wife to the hospital as she delivered her own child . Beth's given birth twice before and credits the successful delivery of her son with the experience she's gained as a mother . 'My husband was on the phone with 911 and they said, ""Do you have something to wrap him in?"" We found something to wrap him in and wrapped him up,' said Beth. Beth Farina started having contractions on Monday night but she and her family went down to the basement after Chicago announced tornado warnings. Trevor fell asleep after the storm but his wife Beth was wide awake and about to give birth in less than ideal circumstances. Farina was in labor for five hours and having given birth two times before she thought her third delivery would be smooth sailing. As Beth was being driven to the hospital by her husband she knew she wasn't going to make it in time. Since Farina is getting her certification to be a nurse and a midwife she was able to handle delivering even though she was a mile away from the hospital. 'It wasn't planned, but I'm glad it happened the way it did, because it will be a story for the rest of our lives,' she said.

"Forget hiring a tutor, there's a new way for pushy parents in China to boost their children's exam scores. One county is offering high school students bonus points on their entrance exams if their parents donate at least four litres of blood. Children of parents who donate this amount will receive a bonus point on their entrance exams to get into high school, or two points for six litres, and three points for eight litres. A county in Zheijiang province in China has introduced a unique new incentive for blood donors: four litres of blood will earn a parent an extra point for their child in high school entrance exams (file picture) Generous blood donors could also be rewarded with free medical care, free rides on public transport and cash rewards, according to the South China Morning Post. The Pujiang county government, based in the eastern Zhejiang province, issued the new directive on July 24 this year as part of a drive to increase blood donation. One man, now 28, started donating blood at the age of 18 and announced he had finally met the four litre mark, winning his future child a bonus point in their exams. 'Because of this policy, I [donated so much blood that I] have put my life at risk! [I] want to tell my future son: No worries with the high school entrance exams, Dad has already got you bonus marks!' the man posted on Chinese blogging site Weibo. The body contains about 5 to 5.6 litres of blood, depending on a person's weight. It would take an adult five years to donate four litres if the person donated blood twice a year. Blood donors must secure a certificate from the government before their children can be rewarded with extra points. In another part of China, people who want to apply for a driving licence, receive their school graduation certificate, take up their first job, or get married in a registry offices are asked to give a voluntary donation as a contribution to society. The body contains about 5 to 5.6 litres of blood, depending on a person's weight. It would take an adult five years to donate four litres if the person donated blood twice a year . First year college students and soldiers are also urged to give blood at least once a year. The new regulations city came into effect in Baoji city in the Shaanxi Province in north west China last week, Chinese TV reports. Both policies have been criticised on social media and blogging sites, by users who said they cheapen an act of charity. 'It's literally a bloody policy for extra marks,' wrote a Weibo user named 'daoluaimi'. 'It is not wrong to promote blood donation. But the method of exchanging blood for marks is too extreme,' another user said.","New policy from Pujiang county government rewards blood donation .

"Allegations: Tennis coach Daniel Erik Hubbard-Wilson, 27 is said to have sexually assaulted a 15-year-old player on a school team . A former high school tennis coach has been arrested after allegedly having a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old member of the varsity team he was 'obsessed with'. Daniel Erik Hubbard-Wilson, 27 from St. Paul, Minnesota, is said to have 'fallen in love' with the girl, who is now 16, forcing her father to take out a restraining order on him. He is said to have assaulted the girl numerous times from September 2013 at the Convent of the Visitation High School in Mendota Heights. According to the Star Tribune the allegations were uncovered when the girl's father confronted her about the relationship a year later. In a bid to protect himself, Hubbard-Wilson is believed to have sent the girl's father a text message that read: 'I fell in love with her so tremendously and I never should have at this time. I made decisions I absolutely never should have at this time. 'But please, my whole life would be destroyed, registering, probation, doing time, I have two sisters I love dearly that I could never see, I could never get a job or move on and go back to grad school. 'I feel terrible and I desperately wanted chance to reinvent myself learning from my mistake.' The complaint published said Hubbard-Wilson was subsequently interviewed by police. He asked for an attorney and the interview was terminated, but Hubbard-Wilson then said, 'I love her, and I know I can't get into much else, but … I … I did, and …' Chris Madel, an attorney for the girl's family, said that the victim will soon be 17 and was 15 when the alleged misconduct began. 'The family is shocked, dismayed and doing their best to work through this difficult time,' Madel said. In a written statement to the Star Tribune, Dawn Nichols, the Head of School, said that Wilson resigned 'citing family reasons.' 'He had been suspended on September 23 after concerns were raised about an inappropriate relationship with a minor,' Nichols said in the statement. 'Visitation School holds the safety and health of its students as its highest priority, and will continue to cooperate fully with authorities.' Hubbard-Wilson has been charged with first degree criminal sexual misconduct and third degree criminal misconduct, both felonies, in Ramsey County District Court. First degree is commonly referred to as rape. He was booked into Ramsey County Jail and his bail has been set at $20,000. He was also told not to have any contact with his victim or females under the age of 16. It is understood that the victim also informed authorities about other students Hubbard-Wilson may have had relationships with, . Sgt. Paul Cottingham, a sex crimes investigator with the St. Paul Police Department, said the investigation into Hubbard-Wilson's activities will expand. 'It's our belief that there are more victims, however, we don't have much information to go on,' Cottingham said.

"Every day we're urged to be more and more energy conscious. But it has been revealed that wind farms were paid £8.7 million to switch off last month because there wasn't enough demand for the energy they generated. And the National Grid has been making the 'constraint payments' for years, with £32 million paid in the last year to keep the turbines powered down. According to the Renewable Energy Foundation (REF), the 'largest monthly amount paid for wind farms not to generate (£8.7 million)' was in March of this year. Wind turbines were paid a record amount of money to shut down last month as they generated more electricity than was needed . The turbines were shut down because, during periods of increased electricity generation and low-peak usage, there is not enough demand for energy. There is currently no adequate method to store the large amounts of energy they produce when it's not being used, so the turbines must be turned off. The 'constraint payments' are made to operators of various wind farms to stop them generating the surplus electricity. 'Wind farm constraints are essentially caused by difficulties in exporting excess wind electricity generated in Scotland,' the REF states on their website. 'In March 2014 approximately 12 per cent of the potential wind power output of large Scottish grid connected wind farms had to be constrained off the system, thus incurring costs to the consumer in the form of constraint payments.' But the REF suggests that the wind industry is 'attempting to conceal the scale of this market abuse, by claiming that wind power receives less in constraint payments than conventional generation. 'This is untrue, and fails to convey the significant distinction between payments to conventional generators to start generating, and additional payments to wind power to stop generating.' More tea? The National Grid claims it is necessary to pay operators to turn the turbines off to cope with periods of fluctuating demand . According to the National Grid, however, these payments are required to cope with periods of increased demand. 'Constraint payments are made when there is congestion on the network,' a spokesperson for the National Grid tells MailOnline. 'It's a bit like with motorways, you get jams but you wouldn't necessarily build new motorways to eliminate the jams. 'So using wind constraint payments we're expecting that to work out as more cost-effective than building lots of new pylons and wires. 'Our job is to manage the electricity . system minute by minute. 'We choose whatever generation is the cheapest . to constrain at a given time to keep costs as low as possible. 'Constraint payments can be made for any number of reasons, including . high winds or parts of the grid being out for maintenance or improvement . work.' The amount of constraint payments has increased considerably since March 2013 when they amounted to just £10,000. The National Grid says this due to a number of factors including windier weather over the past year and more wind turbines coming online. But they hope to reduce constraint payments by increasing the capabilities of the network in the next two years. By 2016 they plan to complete the £1 billion Western Link project 'that will have more than double the capacity from Scotland to England from 2.2GW in 2010 to 5.8GW in 2016.'","A record £8.7m was paid to turn wind farms off last month .

Police were alerted to the wrecked red 2000 Pontiac Grand Am on the side of the road in Des Moines, Iowa, by an anonymous tip around 3:45 a.m. When they arrived on the scene, they discovered the vehicle severed in two, with the rear end entirely crushed. Surprisingly, however, the front half was intact. Scroll down for video . Mystery: A car, pictured, was split fully in half after it hit a power pole on Sunday morning - but the person driving the vehicle is nowhere to be found . 'The front doors, I was told, actually could be opened and closed without a problem,' police spokesman Sgt. Jason Halifax told KCCI. 'Given that information, it's not totally unlikely someone could have walked away from that accident.' Confused detectives found no sign of the driver, and even after bringing in a sniffer dog to search the area, they were no closer to knowing who crashed the car and whether they were OK. 'They searched the area for well over an hour, had a dog come in, the dog wasn't able to find anything,' Halifax said, adding that there was no sign of blood.

Police also checked local hospitals for anyone who might have injuries consistent with a car crash but failed to find any patients who fit the bill, according to WHOTV.com. 'What the officers do now is they go to that last person who had the vehicle registered to them and basically ask them, ""Where's the car now? What did you do with the car? Did you sell it, loan it out? What happened with it?""' Halifax told the station. The Pontiac didn't have license plates when it was found and its last registration expired in August 2012.

Bitter Arctic winds mean that the chilly temperatures are set to continue for the next few days - but picking up slightly in time for the Bank Holiday. The mercury dipped as low as 2.1C in County Down, Northern Ireland, this morning and hovered around 3C in Devon and the Derybshire Peak District. And tomorrow Britain will be colder than Siberia, feeling chillier than an average October in the UK as the Arctic summer shiver peaks. Dairy cows are lit by the rising sun this morning after an 'unseasonably cold' August night  near Monyash in the Derbyshire Peak District .

"Four armed robbers are today being hunted by Paris police after £1million of goods was taken in the first ever organised raid on an Apple Store in France. One worker was injured in the News Year's Eve attack on the shop in the Opera district of the French capital. It took place at around 9pm on Monday, three hours after the close of business on the flagship store, which had reported outstanding business over Christmas and New Year. Raid: The flagship Apple store in Paris (pictured today) was attacked by gunmen on New Year's Eve who took £1million of goods . Police believe it was coordinated to take place as police dealt with large crowds building up for the New Year Eve’s celebrations on the Champs Elysee and by the Eiffel Tower. The robbers, who were masked and carrying handguns, are believed to have attacked a security guard before helping themselves to smartphones and tablets. They then loaded hundreds of them into a van parked nearby, before making off before police arrived. A spokesman for the judicial police in Paris said ‘everything possible' was being done to find the raiders. He said that four suspects were being looked for, and that CCTV images were beings studied. Smash and grab: The robbers injured a member of staff before grabbing iPads and iPhones at around 9pm last night . The spokesman said that one man had been 'lightly injured' in the raid. He was helping police with their enquiries. Christophe Crepin, an Unsa police union official, told Le Parisien newspaper that ‘the four hooded and heavily armed criminals made their move very quickly. Most of the police forces were being mobilised to monitor the Champs Elysees, so the robbers have clearly benefitted from this opportunity to strike.’ Mr Crepin said the robbers mainly took ‘a lot of goods’ and very little money. Early estimates were that the haul was worth well over 1 million euros, or close to 1 million pounds.

Scattered showers will be continuing across the country tomorrow and the top temperature will be hovering around 19C. Mr Williams said: 'On Wednesday it will start to become a little milder, with temperatures closer to average. Due to the Westerly airflow, the temperature will have a chance to recover. 'In general it looks unsettled and changeable over the next two weeks. On the Saturday of the bank holiday it doesn't look too bad, with dry weather, calm winds and some sunny spells. But there be low pressure coming from the Atlantic and depending on how fast that moves across will dictate the weather for the Sunday and Monday.'

"Tory defector Douglas Carswell today defended his decision to join UKIP - declaring: 'I stab people in the front, not the back'. Mr Carswell returned to his Clacton constituency this morning with UKIP leader Nigel Farage amid speculation many more Conservative MPs have considered defecting. Today, the multi-millionaire UKIP donor Stuart Wheeler confirmed that he had wined and dined around eight backbench Tory MPs in an attempt to encourage them to switch allegiance. He added that there were 'another eight I could have easily taken out'. Scroll down for video . UKIP candidate Douglas Carswell went on a walkabout with party leader Nigel Farage in his constuency of Clacton-on-Sea today . Mr Carswell gives a thumbs up to a passing motorist after returning to his constituency this morning . UKIP leader Nigel Farage (left), with  Mr Carswell (right), during a press conference in central London where the Conservative MP defected to his party yesterday . The former party treasurer said he could not give names but boasted that there were a further eight he could have ‘easily’ invited out to lunch. Mr Wheeler told Sky News he took the MPs to a restaurant called Serafino, which he said was no longer open. He said: ‘I didn't say “Would you defect?”. I would say “Would you like to meet Nigel Farage?”. Some of them said yes and obviously Douglas Carswell was one of them.’ Mr Carswell - who officially stood down from Parliament today - said he was taking a risk by forcing a by-election but denied that he had been disloyal to Prime Minister David Cameron. He added: ‘I like David Cameron, he's a nice guy, he's actually good fun. ‘I don't think I've ever stabbed anybody in the back, maybe I occasionally stab one or two people in the front but I've been frank and straight with people. ‘But I think he's not serious about change in Europe and I've put my political career on the line.’ The visit attracted a mixed response from passers-by with one woman shouting at Mr Carswell: ‘The traitor's blocking the street - stop blocking the street, traitor.’ But several cars honked their horns in a show of support and taxi drivers pulled over to praise Mr Carswell. Mr Carswell was among nine Tories wined and dined by Mr Wheeler at a series of discreet lunches in Mayfair. ‘Stuart is quietly confident that more may follow Douglas,’ a source said, adding that the MPs were happy to talk to Mr Wheeler – a former Tory who defected to Ukip – ‘because they knew he understood their sense of divided loyalty’. ‘Stuart understood what they were going through because he had been on the same journey,’ the source said. Mr Cameron was ambushed by the defection of Mr Carswell – a serial rebel – who quit the party with a parting blast that questioned the Prime Minister’s policy on Europe. The MP announced he was joining Ukip and forcing a by-election in his Clacton constituency in Essex, which will be a nightmare for the Tories to defend despite their 12,000 majority in 2010. It is understood that Mr Carswell was among nine Tories wined and dined by millionaire Ukip donor Stuart Wheeler at a series of discreet lunches in Mayfair . Mr Cameron was given no prior warning . of the announcement and could only watch as Ukip leader Nigel Farage . triumphantly paraded Mr Carswell live on TV. The . dramatic move has increased pressure on the Prime Minister to toughen . his stance on immigration and Europe to stem the risk of further . defections. Tory whips . were scrambled to ring round Eurosceptic MPs to shore up support. A . senior Tory source insisted that Mr Carswell appeared to be a ‘lone . wolf’ and played down the prospect of further departures. And . Mr Cameron angrily dismissed Mr Carswell’s move as ‘self-defeating’. ‘It is obviously deeply regrettable when these things happen and people . behave in this way,’ he said. ‘But it is also, in my view, . counter-productive.’ Mr Cameron was ambushed by the defection of Mr Carswell who quit the party with a parting blast that questioned the Prime Minister's policy on Europe . Mr Farage claimed he had been . involved in talks with a number of Tory MPs over the past six months who . ‘very strongly support everything Ukip is trying to do’. He . predicted that further defections will follow if Mr Carswell triumphs . in the by-election, which is likely to be held on October 9 – the week . after the Tory party conference. ‘The real answer to the question about . how many others will join, will all depend on this by-election,’ he . said. ‘This by-election is going to be a High Noon moment.’ However, Mr Carswell faced an immediate potential setback when Ukip’s existing candidate in Clacton refused to make way for him. Roger Lord told Mr Carswell to ‘get in the queue’ but a Ukip spokesman said Mr Lord had been selected to fight next year’s general election, not the by-election. Mr Carswell’s announcement came hours after official figures showed Mr Cameron has almost no chance of keeping his pledge to cut net immigration to below 100,000 a year – last year it rose nearly 40 per cent to 243,000, largely on the back of new arrivals from the EU. Senior Tory Bernard Jenkin said: ‘The Prime Minister has got to spell out in far more detail and indeed in far more fundamental terms what he means... we don’t want to have our economy controlled by the European Union, we want to control the number of people coming in and out of our country. If we want all these things, we’re going to have to change our relationship fundamentally with the EU.’ Fellow Tory Zac Goldsmith described Mr Carswell’s departure as a ‘wake-up call’ while Tory veteran Brian Binley acknowledged that ‘one or two’ colleagues were tempted to join Ukip although he suggested that they would not. Mr Carswell, an early supporter of Mr Cameron’s leadership bid, said the Prime Minister was ‘not serious about change’ when it came to the EU and was only interested in doing the minimum needed to win an election. Speaking at a press conference in London alongside Mr Farage, he said: ‘The problem is that many of those at the top of the Conservative Party are simply not on our side. They aren’t serious about the change that Britain so desperately needs. Of course they talk the talk before elections. They say what they feel they must say to get our support... but on so many issues – on modernising our politics, on the recall of MPs, on controlling our borders, on less government, on bank reform, on cutting public debt, on an EU referendum – they never actually make it happen.’ Mr Carswell   addresses a press conference in London after being introduced by the UKIP leader Nigel Farage . News of the defection was relayed to Mr Cameron at Chequers. Speaking later in Scotland, where he was giving a speech, the Prime Minister said: ‘If you want a referendum on Britain’s future in the EU, whether we should stay or go, the only way to get that is to have a Conservative government after the next election. That is what, until very recently, Douglas Carswell himself was saying.’ Mr Carswell’s decision to trigger a by-election leaves the Conservatives facing a huge battle to prevent him becoming Ukip’s first elected MP. He has built a Tory majority of over 12,000 in what had been a Labour seat. Tory sources last night said the by-election would be held ‘sooner rather than later’ to prevent Ukip gaining momentum. Bookmakers immediately installed Mr Carswell as the odds-on favourite to hold the seat. Mr Carswell’s sudden departure stunned Eurosceptic colleagues who believed he had settled his differences with the leadership – he publicly urged colleagues to stop rocking the boat six months ago, writing on Twitter: ‘Only the Conservatives will guarantee and deliver an in/out referendum. It will only happen if Cameron is Prime Minister.’ Former defence secretary Liam Fox said: ‘After the next general election, either Ed Miliband is going to be the Prime Minister, or David Cameron. If it’s not David Cameron there’s not going to be a referendum on Europe. 'What’s worse, we’ll get a return to open door immigration policies which many of the Ukip supporters seem to dislike most of all.’","Douglas Carswell resigned from the Conservative Party and Parliament .

Veolia thinks most of the sorting can be done post-collection and that four bins are more than enough.’ Government officials insist councils should be left to decide how to collect rubbish. They are looking closely at the wording of the revised EU Waste Framework Directive, which remains shrouded in confusion. They claim the rules may not lead to more bins – as local authorities could be exempted if they demonstrate that adding bins is not feasible. Officials also say waste could be collected in fewer bins and then separated by binmen on the pavement – but Veolia has dismissed this proposal as dangerous. The company has attacked the latest rules as ‘unnecessary’ and ‘completely impractical’, adding that modern technology means most rubbish can be separated after it has been collected. The firm said those calling for more separate collections are ‘trying to push an environmental agenda that they don’t understand’. A YouGov poll commissioned by Veolia suggested 69 per cent of people are not prepared to separate their rubbish into more than four bins. The poll found that 94 per cent of the 2,500 respondents said recycling was important – but only 12 per cent considered having six or more bins reasonable. Richard Kirkman, Veolia’s technical director, said: ‘The public are very supportive of recycling, but we must make it easy for them.’ Firm says those asking for more collections are 'pushing an environmental agenda that they don’t understand’ ‘Some other groups and consultants are trying to push an environmental agenda that they don’t understand. They are pushing for everything to be separate... this will be completely impractical for people. We are just saying let’s be sensible, it needs to be easier for people, not harder.’ The wording of the waste regulation, drawn up in 2010, is so unclear that the European Commission had to issue a separate document on how to follow the rules. This still failed to clarify matters, and there has been much debate over whether the rules compel councils to introduce extra bins, or if different items can be placed together in single ‘co-mingled’ containers. Environment Minister Lord de Mauley has given guidance to councils, stating: ‘Separate collection does not of course mean that each household will need more bins. 'For example, many areas have kerbside sort systems where materials are sorted before being loaded into the waste collection vehicle.’ However, Mr Kirkman said kerbside separation ‘is not feasible everywhere’, adding: ‘It is not very safe.’ The Local Government Association insisted councils should be left alone to decide how to deal with waste. A spokesman said: ‘There is no one-size-fits-all solution... the types of bin which would suit a large detached house in the country would be completely unsuitable for a high-rise block of flats in inner-city London, and vice versa.’ A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ‘Waste collections need to be easy to understand for residents. ‘Local councils are best placed to decide how to organise collection schemes in their areas. This new regulation does not mean households require more bins.’","Waste company Veolia has launched campaign against 'unnecessary bins'

"Jason Bohn will take a one-shot lead into the final round of the OHL Classic at Mayakoba as he goes in search of a first PGA Tour win in over four years. The American came into the day one shot behind overnight leader Michael Putnam but shot a 67, which was 10 shots better than his playing partner, to move to 15 under. Shawn Stefani was the third member of the final group and a 68 was good enough to move him to 14 under, two shots clear of Charley Hoffman and German Alex Cejka. Jason Bohn, pictured last week, will be hoping to win the last PGA Tour event of the calendar year . Bohn claimed his last win in April 2010 in New Orleans and looked well on course to take a larger advantage into the final day at El Camaleon as he led by three going up the last. But a closing bogey coupled with a birdie for Stefani saw the gap narrowed to a single shot at the top of the leaderboard. Bohn registered three birdies in his opening five holes but dropped one at the sixth before a further birdie on eight saw him reach the turn in 33. The 41-year-old then picked up shots on 10 and 13 to seemingly put him in total control before the two-shot swing on the last. Birdies on four, five, 11 and 13 had Stefani in the hunt but bogeys on 16 and 17 saw him slip back before his closing birdie. Overnight leader Michael Putnam, pictured on Friday, was overtaken by fellow American Bohn . A run of four birdies from the fourth to the seventh and an eagle on the par-five 13th lit up Hoffman's round while Cejka overcame a double bogey on the 10th with five birdies in his 68. Andres Gonzales, Jerry Kelly, Danny Lee and Ken Duke were all on 11 under with veteran Fred Funk a further shot back. Putnam slipped nine shots off the lead but was level par for his round through 15 on Saturday. However a double-bogey, triple-bogey, bogey finish saw his round implode as he fell off the pace. Bohn finished in a tie for second at the Sanderson Farms Championship last week and he feels a better understanding of his game is contributing to his form. 'Four under par was a good score,' he told a press conference following his round. '(It was) A little sour to finish with a bogey on the last hole but that's the way it works.' He added: 'I've always tried to do things with the golf ball that maybe I can't actually do and I'm just really comfortable in a place where I kind of know my own game. 'I'm not a bomber but I can keep it in front of me and I can hit some good solid iron shots in there. 'It's a little bit just being comfortable and relaxing and having fun.' Rain made conditions difficult for all players on Saturday and Bohn was pleased with how he handled the conditions. 'Once it started raining it got very difficult,' he said. 'The greens got a little bit slower just from the rain so you had to make an adjustment there. 'If you were in the rough you could catch some squirters where the ball could fly. 'It was just tough.'","American golfer Jason Bohn's last win came in New Orleans in April 2010 .

"When looking for a thrill or a rush of excitement, people do things like take spontaneous cross-country road trips, go bungee jumping, or, if they’re really brave, go skydiving. But for renowned skier and base jumper Erik Roner, excitement is nothing less than being airlifted in a lawn chair by 90 balloons and shooting his way down with a shotgun. Yes, you read that correctly. In his latest trick, the extreme sportsman from Tahoe City, California, used 50 tanks of helium to create a quirky piece of flying kit.

"Charlie Pallett, 93, last boarded a plane during the Second World War when he was evacuated from Germany on a stretcher. His wife of 71 years, Madge, 91, has never stepped foot in an aircraft and her sole overseas jaunt was a day trip by ferry to Le Touqet in France. That's all about to change for the sprightly nonagenarian duo as they head off for a week in Benidorm to spend their  first overseas holiday together. Time to pack: Madge, 91, and Charlie Pallett, 93,  prepare for their first ever overseas holiday to Benidorm . Hitting the pool: Charlie, 93, shows off his swimming trunks from the 1960s he found while packing . Charlie and Madge, from Shepway, Kent, have always taken their trips away to the British seaside but will soon be sunning themselves at Spain's Hotel Sol Pelicanos, a filming location for the hit TV series Benidorm. Royal Army Service Corps veteran Charlie joked that the plane's legroom may not be up to the standard he's accustomed to after his medical evacuation on a stretcher. 'I flew in a Dakota from Germany to France when I broke my ankle during the war but that was a hospital plane,' he said. 'It was lovely, I got to lie down on a stretcher but I'm not sure if I'll get the same legroom this time. 'I never wanted to go back to Europe after the war, but I have put that all behind me now.' Madge, who made camouflage nets during World War Two, is putting her own anxieties behind her as the pair set off for the resort at which hit TV series Benidorm is filmed. Jet-setting: Charlie has not been on a plane since the Second World War and Madge has only left England once . 'Madge has never set foot on a plane and she gets very anxious on public transport, you can't even get her on a bus. I fell off my chair when she said yes [to the trip],' Charlie said. She said: 'I'm very nervous but I'm also very excited about it. It's going into the unknown for me.' Charlie will however have to buy a new pair of swimming trunks after finding a pair of old favourites while packing: 'I think [they] are from the 1960s. They were very fashionable back then, but I don't think I'll take them with me. 'I was asked what the pocket inside them was for and I said that's where I'm going to keep my false teeth.' The grandparents of five and great-grandparents of seven will make the trip with daughters Doreen England, 67, Yvonne Elliott, 65, and their granddaughter Leigh Plumbly, 46. Fun in the sun: The Palletts will stay at the Sol Pelicanos Ocas Hotel, where the TV show Benidorm is filmed . Beside the seaside: Mr and Mrs Pallett, who have been married 71 years, have always holidayed in Britain . 'Our daughters had been talking about going away and we were enthusing over the brochures,' Charlie said. Yvonne, a retired cook, said: 'We didn't really have many family holidays when I was little because we couldn't afford them. 'I remember going to Dymchurch, when my dad was a driver and we went in the back of his three-tonne lorry. 'When we got there everything stunk of diesel. I never thought in my life I would be going abroad with my mum and dad.' Other favourite holiday haunts for the couple have included Great Yarmouth, Norfolk and Dorset. Fish out of water: The Costa Blanca resort trip is just the start of the Pallett's new wave of adventures . Famous faces: The cast of hit ITV television show Benidorm, which is filmed at Hotel Sol Pelicanos . Far from their age being any sort of disadvantage, the Palletts got a pleasant surprise when they went to update their long-overdue passports. 'You get them free when you are older than 90, but that's not the reason we've waited until now,' Charlie said. 'The next time we have to get them renewed is when we are 101 and 103.' And if Madge thinks this breakaway adventure is a one-off, she's got another thing coming with Charlie already planning his next flight... on the outside of a plane. 'I have wanted to do a wing-walk for a long time, and hopefully with this under my belt I will finally do one next year,' he said.","Royal Army Service Corps veteran Charlie Pallett's last flight was when he was being evacuated on a stretcher from Germany during World War Two .

"Role model: Sir Patrick with Ian Makins at a cricket match. Mr Makins is one of four beneficiaries of the late Sky At Night presenter's £400,000 legacy . Sky At Night presenter Sir Patrick Moore left almost everything he owned to four men he regarded as his ‘sons’ – even though he wasn’t related to them. The astronomer, who died aged  89 in 2012, never married or had children of his own. But after several of his friends died relatively young, he became a father figure to their sons. Four of the men – Ian Makins, 53, . Chris Doherty, 35, and brothers Lawrence Clarke, 62, and Matthew Clarke, . 58 – were the main beneficiaries of his will. Probate . records released last week revealed that Sir Patrick  left a net estate . worth £420,707  and made his close friend, Queen guitarist Brian May, . an executor. His will . requested that his body be offered for medical research and transplants, . and asked his executors to ‘find loving homes’  for his cats Jeannie . and Ptolemy and use his estate to pay for their upkeep. He . also left gifts totalling £15,700 for 21 friends and £500 for a . ‘farewell party’ at his cottage – known as ‘Farthings’ in Selsey, West . Sussex. The will, which was . drawn up in 2010, stated that the party should ‘carry on the Farthings . Rules’, which meant that guests could pour themselves drinks without . asking. He also stated that . his belongings, which included artworks and scientific instruments, be . distributed according to any instructions he left or as his executors . wished. The rest of his estate was split between Mr Makins, Mr Doherty and the Clarke brothers after payment of inheritance tax. Father- . of-two Matthew Clarke, who owns a bookshop  in Paignton, Devon, said: . ‘My father became friends with Patrick when they joined the RAF . together. He was part of our lives from when we were born. He would take . us on trips to the BBC to see The Sky At Night being produced. ‘Patrick helped me get my first job in publishing. My father died when I was 22 and my mother passed away a few years later, but Patrick was always there for us. I used to speak to him every Sunday. He was a total one-off and extremely generous. His death left a big hole in our lives.’ Mr Clarke’s brother Lawrence, also a father-of-two, edited many of Sir Patrick’s books. He said: ‘He wrote a wedding march for my wife and I when we got married. He was someone you could talk to in confidence.’ Unmarried: Sir Patrick at his investiture at Buckingham Palace in 2001 with his adopted son Chris Doherty, right . Sir Patrick, who became the youngest member of the British Astronomical Association at the age of 11, served with the RAF during the Second World War. His fiancée Lorna, a nurse, was killed in an air raid in 1943 when she was 20. He later said his ‘whole life ended that day’. Sir Patrick began presenting The Sky At Night in 1957, making it the longest-running television series with the same presenter. His ability to describe complex phenomena in an exciting and simple way made him a household name, and he was knighted  in 2001.","Astronomer, who last year died aged 89, never married or had children .

"The number of babies born last year was the highest in more than 40 years, according to official figures. There were nearly 724,000 newborn children in England and Wales, the greatest number since 1971, at the tail end of the 1960s baby boom. A key reason for the rising numbers of babies is the large-scale immigration of the past decade, which has brought in mainly young men and women ready to have families. Baby boom: The number of babies born in Britain in 2012 was the highest for 40 years, new figures reveal . Newly-arrived migrants also tend to have higher birth-rates than people in the existing population. The impact of immigration on childbirth . was underlined by another rise in the number of babies born to women who . were themselves born abroad. Impact: The increase was partly fuelled by a high number of babies born to mothers who were themselves born abroad . The share of babies born to immigrant . mothers went up again, to 25.9 per cent, well over a quarter of all . births. Another factor pushing up birthrates was the growing trend for women of 40 and older to have children. Numbers of babies born to 40-somethings are now running at five times the level of the mid-1970s and reached almost 30,000 last year. The leap in 40-plus-year-olds having families is a result of large numbers of women delaying having families because of education, careers, mortgages and their own unstable relationships, and then trying to catch up as they reach the end of their childbearing years. The figures released by the Office for . National Statistics show the 724,674 babies were born in England and . Wales in 2012, 0.8 per cent more than in 2011. For . Britain as a whole, the increase was slightly less, a 0.6 per cent rise . to 812,970. The lesser increase across the United Kingdom was a result . of falling numbers of births in Scotland. A . report by the ONS said there was no single reason for the increase, but . pointed to a rise in childbirth among women in their late 20s, and . ‘increases in the numbers of foreign-born women who tend to have higher . fertility than UK-born women’. It . also said there is a possibility of ‘Government policy and the economic . climate indirectly influencing individuals’ decisions around . childbearing.’ Sir Andrew Green of the Migrationwatch think tank said that the figures showed how immigration is pushing up population and stretching public services. New data shows there has been a marked increase in the number of births in the paste decade . The number of women in their 40s having babies has increased fivefold since the 1970s . ‘If anyone wonders why our maternity wards are under such pressure, this is the answer,’ he said. ‘The official projections show that just over two thirds of our population increase is a result of immigration. Part of this is new arrivals make a contribution to birthrates, as these figures show.’ Numbers of births in England and Wales were last higher than in 2012 in 1971, when 783,155 children were born in England and Wales. At the time birthrates were going down sharply following the peak of the baby boom in 1964. The lowest number of childbirths in any year since World War Two came in 1977, when there were 569,259 births. In 2001 there were just under 600,000 children born in England and Wales. Subsequent years have seen birth numbers rising along with immigration that has added three million people to the population.","Nearly 724,000 babies born in England and Wales last year .

"House prices in Britain will not return to their pre-recession peak until the end of the decade, making this the longest slump in the property market since records began. A report by a leading estate agent said the price of the average home peaked at £183,959 in 2007 but has fallen so dramatically it will not return to this level until 2019. The 12-year recovery period could be the longest since records began in the 1950s. The report said that once the impact of inflation is stripped out, average prices will not return to 2007 levels until 2031 – an incredible 24 years after they peaked. Slump: A report produced by estate agent Knight Frank warns that house prices will not return to their 2007 peak value until 2019 . In contrast, house prices in the most expensive areas of central London have already clawed back all their losses and are now at record highs as rich Brits and foreigners plough money into the capital. Grainne Gilmore, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, which produced the report, said: ‘Some five years after the start of the financial crisis, the housing sector in the UK still does not bear the hallmarks of a fully functioning market.’ In the previous market crash, prices peaked at £62,782 in 1989 and did not reach that level again until 1998 – a nine year slump. Crash: The report says that the recovery period will be the longest since records began in the 1950s. It warns that once the impact of inflation is stripped out, average prices will not return to 2007 levels until 2031 . Miss Gilmore said the current downturn was even worse in part due to the sharp fall in transactions triggered by a shortage of mortgage lending. ‘Transaction levels have roughly halved since the last market peak in 2007, and are 35 per cent below the 20-year average, as first-time buyers and those further up the housing ladder struggle with tighter mortgage lending rules,’ she said. House prices fell by around 15 per cent as the financial crisis struck in 2008 and have barely recovered since then. Knight Frank said prices fell two per cent last year and predicted another two per cent fall this year before a meagre one per cent rise in 2014. Prices are expected to fall in every region of the UK in 2013 with Scotland and Wales suffering declines of more than three per cent. Miss Gilmore said: ‘We do not see average prices reaching their 2007 peak again until 2019 – which would mark the longest period between price peaks in more than 60 years. 'Once inflation is stripped out, average UK house prices are unlikely to hit 2007 levels again in real terms until 2031.’ However, the report painted a different picture in central London where ‘prime’ house prices –those worth around £2million or more – rose 8 per cent last year following a 12.1 per cent jump in 2010. Prices in upmarket areas such as Mayfair and Kensington are expected to be flat this year before rising by another 4 per cent in 2014, according to Knight Frank. A report last week named Egerton Crescent in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea the most expensive street in Britain – with the average house price topping £8million. Liam Bailey, global head of residential research at Knight Frank, said: ‘As always the average position across the UK has disguised the performance of different submarkets, and none has been more different than the central London market. ‘Prime property prices in central London have bucked the trend of the wider housing market in the UK over the past few years. ‘The demand for luxury London homes from overseas buyers looking for a safe-haven for their money, as well as a slice of London life has helped drive price increases.’ Billionaires' row: Despite house values falling across the UK, values in London's most expensive area are at record highs. A report last showed that Egerton Crescent is the most expensive street in the UK with the average property costing over £8million .","Price of average home peaked in 2007 at £183,959 according to report .

"Airline-style checklists are to be introduced on hospital wards – as new figures reveal three patients a day are dying due to blunders. Modelled on pilots’ pre-flight checks, the new system will ensure everyone knows what is meant to be happening, so that fatal mistakes are not made. Hospitals in England paid compensation over 1,078 deaths last year. Airline-style checklists are to be introduced on hospital wards – as new figures reveal three patients a day are dying due to blunders (file picture) That cost taxpayers £58 million – the highest sum in at least five years – according to the NHS Litigation Authority. Separate statistics show there have been 56 ‘never events’ – errors so serious they should never happen – across the NHS in England in the past three months alone. They include the case of a healthy kidney being removed from a woman after it was wrongly identified as an ectopic pregnancy. Peter Walsh, of the charity Action Against Medical Accidents, warned that ‘thousands more patients’ were probably dying every year because of hospital blunders and that the 1,078 deaths were ‘just the tip of the iceberg’. Former pilot Martin Bromiley, whose wife Elaine died in 2005 after a series of errors during a routine nose operation, helped develop the checklist system. He said: ‘Just as an aircraft is dependent on every crew member, ground staff and air traffic control, patients are dependent on every member of the hospital care team.’ The initiative is being piloted by the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh with funding from the Heath Foundation.","A new system of airline-style checklists to be introduced on hospital wards .
