Australia's swimming team at the London Olympics had a 'toxic culture' that was not reined in by team leadership, according to a new report . Culture and leadership consultant Dr Pippa Grange said the London Olympics represented almost the perfect storm of factors leading to a poor team culture, poor results and instances of bullying among team members. Grange wrote that a focus on individualised training regimes and not team training leading into the Games led to a lack of bonding among athletes. The Australian swimming team won 20 medals at Beijing, but only managed 10 at London 2012 . This lack of team identity was . exacerbated by a lack of leadership within the team and external factors . such as media pressure, Grange added. Grange wrote the end result was a 'lonely' Olympics for many athletes who simply put their head down and got on with the job, while other athletes experienced issues with prescription drugs, alcohol and bullying. The report said: 'Swimmers seemed to have missed the power of a shared experience, and critically, of friendship. In simplest terms this meant it was a lot less enjoyable than they expected. 'It is plausible that emotional tension in the group built to disharmony and sometimes became exclusion and, in the rare extreme, animosity between athletes. 'Poor behaviour and disrespect within the team were not regulated or resisted strongly by other team members, and it was left unchecked or without consequence by staff and coaches on a number of occasions. Alicia Coutts won five medals at the London Games, making her one of Australia's most successful athletes there . 'Some individual incidents of unkindness, peer intimidation, hazing and just 'bad form' as a team member that were escalated to personal coaches were not addressed and had no further consequence. 'Standards, discipline and accountabilities for the swim team at the London Olympics were too loose. 'There were enough culturally toxic incidents across enough team members that breached agreements (such as getting drunk, misuse of prescription drugs, breaching curfews, deceit, bullying) to warrant a strong, collective leadership response that included coaches, staff and the swimmers.' The Austrlian Swimming team arrived in London defending 20 medals from Beijing 2008. But the team only won 10 swimming medals, with just one gold. Grange said the media also played its role in the problems that eventuated and that the use of social media by athletes as they interacted with the general public proved a distraction. Grange wrote: 'There was no filter between the athlete and anyone who wanted to have an opinion on their performance, and that commentary did not need to be shaped with journalistic skill and experience, nor did it have any boundaries.' 'Some athletes engaged deeply in public debate on what they were doing, how they were doing, and even on who they actually were as individuals. This served to fuel emotions, good and bad, at a time where calmness, intensive focus and consistency should have prevailed.' Among Dr Grange's six recommendations . for Swimming Australia was the construction of an ethical framework that . laid out what the team stood for and a major focus on developing a . social media policy for athletes. She added: 'Social media also allowed already disconnected athletes to seek support from sources external to the team, which again diminished the reliance on a unified team. 'In addition, the glorification of a few was seen somewhere between embarrassing and irritating to other team members and added to a growing notion that the rest of the athletes were not really valued. 'One person said he felt that it was not really about whether you swam your heart out, it was about whether you could sell your heart out.'","A report shows that the Australian swimming squad had poor team culture and bullying .

Five thousand fatherless children have been born to lesbian couples and single mothers following fertility treatment in the past decade (posed by model) Five thousand fatherless children have been born to lesbian couples and single mothers following fertility treatment in the past decade, the Daily Mail can reveal. The figure emerged on the day that it was announced that lesbians and older women are due to get free IVF on the taxpayer. Women aged 40 to 42 will qualify for state-funded fertility treatment for the first time, according to the guidelines from the health spending watchdog NICE. Previously, the watchdog did not recommend IVF on the NHS for the over-39s. And – despite fears the cash-strapped health service cannot afford extra burdens – women in same-sex relationships with proven infertility will also be able to get free IVF. Up until now, lesbian couples have had to pay privately for such treatment. Campaigners warned that the ruling will create a generation of fatherless children – which was bad for both the youngsters and society as a whole. Official figures show that in the past decade, a total of 4,899 children have been born following fertility treatment either to single women or lesbian couples. The number of such births has surged since the law was controversially changed in 2008. The requirement that fertility doctors consider a child’s need for a male role model before giving IVF treatment or facilitating insemination was axed. It was felt that the law discriminated against singletons and lesbian couples. Since that year, the total number of babies created without a father has almost quadrupled from 312 to 1,124. This amounts to more than three births every single day. Betty Knowles, 47, and Natalie Woods, 38, registering the birth of Lily-May Betty Woods. They were the first same sex couple to be able to register both names on the birth certificate without having to go through the adoption procedure . Last night Norman Wells, from the pressure group Family and Youth Concern, said: ‘It was always inevitable that removing the legal requirement to consider the need of a child for a father would result in a rise in fatherless families. ‘We should be no less concerned about the creation of children deprived of a father than we are concerned about other forms of deprivation suffered by children. ‘Research demonstrates that the absence of fathers has adverse consequences for children, for mothers and for society. Fathers are not an optional extra. ‘Not only will children suffer as a result of deliberately being brought into the world without a father in the home, but the law is sending out the dangerous message that fatherhood amounts to no more than sperm donation.’ Josephine Quintavalle, from the group Comment on Reproductive Ethics, said: ‘It is sad to see the role of the father increasingly diminished in this way. ‘Fatherhood and all the subsequent responsibilities and joy that come with the role cannot be fulfilled by an anonymous donation of sperm.’ The most recent annual data from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority shows that in 2011 there were 707 babies born to single mothers using either IVF or donor insemination, and 417 to women in a lesbian relationship. The comparable figures for 2008 – when the law was changed – were 149 for single women and 163 for lesbians. The data reveals only details of those women who were treated at a licensed clinic in the UK, so it is believed many so-called DIY donor inseminations are not officially registered. Andrea Williams, chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre, said: ‘Our approach to IVF and donor insemination should take account of the child’s needs, not just the desires of women who want children. ‘Children have a right to a father as well as a mother. We can’t just airbrush dads out of the picture. ‘They are essential for children’s wellbeing. Many women do a great job of bringing up children single-handedly. ‘But…we shouldn’t be intentionally creating circumstances where children miss out on having a dad.’ The shake-up of the NICE guidelines means women aged 40-42 failing to get pregnant after two years of trying, or 12 cycles of artificial insemination, should be offered one full cycle of IVF, if they have never previously had IVF treatment. This could lead to some or all of around 8,000 women currently paying privately for IVF in their early 40s each year turning to the health service. Lesbians under 40 who fail to conceive after 12 cycles of artificial insemination – which could be paid for by the NHS – will then qualify for three cycles of IVF funding.","Number of births surged since the law was controversially changed in 2008 .

Deal: Chancellor George Osborne said the Government was committed to tackling tax evasion, as it announced a deal with authorities on the Isle of Man that will see financial information on taxpayers passed to HMRC . Tax dodgers hiding money on the Isle of Man will be forced to admit that they are evading tax or face huge penalties. The Government yesterday struck a deal with Manx authorities in an attempt to clamp down on tax evasion that could see millions of pounds in unpaid bills recouped. Under the arrangement, financial information on taxpayers will automatically be sent to HM Revenue and Customs. But the inclusion of a 'disclosure facility' means that individuals will have three years to pay outstanding bills before their details are passed to authorities who could impose penalties of 200 per cent. It is understood that those who do come forward will still be met with fines, albeit much smaller ones, despite being immune from prosecution. Unpaid tax from 2009 for those who come forward is expected to carry a 10 per cent penalty, while affairs dating back to 1999 will incur fines of 20 per cent. The disclosure facility will open on April 6 and is expected to close on September 2016. The Treasury said the deal with the . Manx authorities closely followed an agreement struck with the United . States to improve international tax compliance. Discussions are also taking place with . the authorities in Jersey and Guernsey on improving the exchange of . financial information. Chancellor George Osborne reinforced a commitment to tackling tax evasion, saying that the agreement will 'greatly enhance HMRC's ability to clamp down on those who try to hide their money offshore'. He added: 'I welcome the progress made . with the Isle of Man and look forward to working on this new standard . in the automatic exchange of tax information.' Incentive: The inclusion of a 'disclosure facility' means that individuals hiding money on the Isle of man will have three years come forward and pay outstanding bills . The move follows an agreement last month with Switzerland to recover previously unpaid UK tax on funds held in Swiss accounts which is forecast to bring in more than £5 billion over the next six years. Mr Osborne said: 'The agreement builds on the groundbreaking work we have already carried out - the UK Government has signed agreements with the US and Switzerland so far and we are in discussions with Jersey and Guernsey as part of our common commitment to combat tax evasion.' The Government has said that enhancing international tax transparency will be one of the key themes of Britain's presidency of the G8.","'Disclosure facility' to allow individuals to come forward incurring small fines .

Former Polly Peck chief executive Asil Nadir could return to Cyprus or Turkey after it was reported he paid the £5m compensation demanded by the courts . Disgraced tycoon Asil Nadir, who claims to be broke, has reportedly paid £5million in compensation to his devastated investors and could now fly home within months. Lawyers for the 71-year-old are working to secure a prisoner transfer deal to Turkey, opening the door to his return to Northern Cyprus. The former Polly Peck boss has found the compensation ordered by an Old Bailey judge last year and is likely to go home less than a year into his ten-year sentence for stealing almost £29million. Nadir, who is being held at Belmarsh Prison, is claiming to be completely broke, with no assets and no income. His £1million-plus bill for a defence team at the Old Bailey was paid for by legal aid. The Serious Fraud Office is convinced he has hidden his money as he has rented a £21,000 per month Mayfair home while employing a driver and security. But he claims his family paid for it all. His glamorous second wife Nur, 28, . spent his trial shopping in designer West End stores and riding horses . before leaving the country when he was jailed. But the outstanding £5million compensation has been met by his friend, airline magnate Hamit Cankut bagana, Nadir's supporters have said. The Times said today that Nadir, who has Turkish and British citizenship, will try to head to Turkey and negotiations between the two countries about repatriation are at an advanced stage. Last month a source close to negotiations told the Mail that . Nadir is desperate to get out of Britain. He . added: ‘The suggestion is that once in Turkey he will quickly return to . Northern Cyprus to serve his time under “house arrest” if at all.’ Asil Nadir, pictured in his lavish Cyprus property, could fly home within months . If he does leave it will anger tens of thousands of investors who lost money when his empire collapsed in 1990. And any deal would have to be signed off at Secretary of State level by Chris Grayling – a move which could be politically toxic because of Nadir’s history with the Tory party. In the 1980s Nadir donated £440,000 to the Conservative Party which it has refused to return despite his conviction. Allowing him to go home might leave the Government open to charges it was doing a favour for a disgraced former party donor. Home: Nadir is currently in Belmarsh Prison (pictured), south-east London, but could soon be heading back to Cyprus to finish his sentence . Nadir returned to Britain from his . home in Northern Cyprus to ‘clear his name’ in 2010 after fleeing in . 1993 before he went on trial. Last August he was convicted of stealing £28.6million from his Polly Peck International textile empire. An .

The 22-year Serious Fraud Office investigation and complex trial is estimated to have cost taxpayers more than £20million.

David McMahon was blinded in one eye after he was hit by a golf ball struck by golfer Gavin Dear. The pensioner is now suing the pro for £50,000 . A pensioner is suing a professional golfer for £50,000 after being blinded in one eye by a ball while he worked at a tournament. David McMahon was on the course at the Scottish amateur Champion of Champions event, looking for balls struck into the gorse by competitors, when he was struck by a shot that ruptured his eyeball. Mr McMahon, 70, is seeking £50,000 from Gavin Dear, a former Walker Cup player who turned professional in 2009. Yesterday, a judge was told that the amount of damages had been agreed between lawyers in the action – but that liability was still contested. Mr McMahon said he had approached a couple who had strayed off a path and asked them to move as they were in danger where they were standing at the tournament on Leven Links, Fife, in April 2009. He said Mr Dear was ‘on the edge of the semi rough’ between the sixth and 12th fairways. Mr McMahon then turned to walk back to his golf buggy when he was hit in the eye by a ball. He told the court: ‘I landed right on the ground. The ball hit me and I went down. 'I covered my eye with my glove. I took my glove back and it was full of blood.’ Mr McMahon was asked by his counsel, Ronald Clancy, QC, if he heard anyone shout a warning before he was hit by the ball and he replied: ‘No.’ Mr Clancy asked him what he would have done if at the point he turned away from speaking to the spectators to return to the buggy he had heard the warning shout of ‘Fore’. Mr McMahon responded: ‘I would have become the ground. I have been hit eight times by golf balls and, take my word for it, it is sore.’ When questioned by Graham Primrose, QC for Mr Dear, the retired bus driver from Leven denied he was behind the buggy and emerged into the path of the ball. Mr Dear, pictured at a tournament last year, claims Mr McMahon was not in sight when he hit the ball . In the action, it is said that Mr McMahon suffered a traumatic rupture of the right eyeball resulting in blindness to the eye. It is alleged that Mr Dear knew,  or ought to have known, that Mr McMahon was in line with the path of his ball to the sixth hole. It is claimed that, had the golfer exercised reasonable care in ensuring that no one was standing in a position to be struck by the ball, he would not have been injured. Mr Dear, 28, of Scone, Perthshire, maintains that neither Mr McMahon nor the alleged spectators were visible at any stage to him, his playing partner or two men accompanying them on their round. He said he had played his tee shot on the par five sixth hole into light rough which divides the sixth and 12th fairways and was content with its landing position. Leven Links Golf Course in Fife. Mr McMahon was working at the Scottish amateur Champion of Champions event . He claims that he saw a buggy but there was no sign of any person at or near it. Mr Dear maintains that, having considered the position of the buggy and noted the absence of any activity, he proceeded to consider playing his second shot. It is said: ‘He had no reason not to believe that it was safe and appropriate to do so.’ It is claimed that after the ball was struck Mr McMahon emerged ‘suddenly and without warning’ from behind a golf cart.

The stepmother of a 13-year-old boy who died after he was beaten and kept in a dog cage has been sentenced to 35 years in jail. Kimberly Kubina, 47, pleaded guilty to felony neglect over teenager Christian Choate’s death, whose severely malnourished body was found in a shallow grave at a mobile home park in Gary, Indiana shortly after he was reported missing in May 2011. Kubina’s former husband Riley Choate, 40, of Hammond, Indiana was also sentenced to 80 years in prison last month. Kept in a dog cage: Kimberly Kubina (right) was sentenced to 35 years for the death of stepson Christian Choate (left) who was beaten for several years and kept in a cage for as long as a year before he died . Investigators said the boy was beaten for several years and kept in a cage for as long as a year before he died at the age of 13 in early 2009. His disappearance went unreported until Lake County police unearthed his body in May, 2011 from a shallow grave. The Lake County Coroner's Office determined he died of blunt force trauma injuries and a skull fracture. Kubina told the Lake Superior Court that she was remorseful for not stopping the abuse involving her stepson. She said that Choate was intimidating and violent and that she feared that the other children, including several nephews and nieces, she was looking after would be taken away by the welfare authorities. Father's son: Christian's father and Kubina's former husband Riley Choate was sentenced to 80 years in jail last month over his involvement in the boy's death . She said in court, according to the Chicago Sun-Times: ‘In our house, whatever Riley said was law.’ The woman told the judge that she . suffered nightmares about what had happened and that the other children, . who had seen the abuse, were emotionally scarred. Christian was kept in a dog cage and . Kubina told the court in May that she told his sister to only feed him . Asian noodles while locked up as punishment for 'molesting' his younger . step-brother. The . unidentified sister was not the only one to know about the horrible . suffering that the boy endured, and up to 13 people are thought to have . known about the torture without alerting the police. Court . records state that the father, Riley Choate, has admitted burying . Christian's body under a storage shed with a Bible across his chest but . denied causing the boy's death. Kubina, the stepmother, repeatedly has denied any wrongdoing, court and Indiana Department of Child Services records show.

Investigators . say the boy was beaten for several years and kept in a cage for as long . as a year before he died at the age of 13 in early 2009. Both Choate and Kubina had pleaded not guilty to all charges surrounding Christian’s death originally. Intimidating and violent: Kubina told the court: 'In our house, whatever Riley said was law,' after Christian's severely malnourished body was found in a shallow grave at a mobile home park in Gary, Indiana . Choate made a deal with prosecutors . to plead guilty to some charges in return for a lessened sentence and to . avoid a jury trial. He pleaded guilty to felony charges including . moving a body after death and neglect of a dependent causing death. In return for the guilty pleas, prosecutors dropped charges of murder, battery, criminal confinement and obstruction of justice. Choate . himself addressed the judge before learning his fate in January, . saying: 'All my actions will haunt me forever. I loved my son.' Kubina was given a similar deal for testifying against her former husband. Kubina's sister, Belinda Bradburn, told The Times she witnessed abuse once while visiting her sister and the children when they lived in Merrillville. She said she saw Riley Choate hit Christian in the arm. 'When that happened, I just said, ""Kim, I'm leaving. This is kind of ridiculous that he would just hit a kid, and you need to do something about this"",' Bradburn recalled. Body placement: Choate has admitted burying Christian's body under a storage shed. Kubina told the Lake Superior Court that she was remorseful for not stopping the abuse involving her stepson . In December MailOnline reported that Christian wrote letters from his squalid prison about how he wanted his life to end. He wrote: ‘I want to die’ on the paper given to him by his stepmother to scribble down how he felt. In the handwritten notes, he said he simply wanted to be liked by his family  - even if they were ‘abusing’ him. Christian writes how he had to steal food when he was hungry because his family allegedly would not feed him. He would only be let out to clean the house and was almost never allowed outside. ‘Christian wrote of why nobody liked him and how he just wanted to be liked by his family,’ DCS records state. ‘Christian stated that he wanted to die because nobody liked the way he 'acted.' The records continue: 'Christian's writings detail a very sad, depressed child who often wondered when someone, anyone, was going to come check on him and give him food or liquid.

A federal jury awarded crime writer Patricia Cornwell nearly $51 million Tuesday in her lawsuit against her former financial management company and a former principal in the firm. It found New York-based Anchin, Block & Anchin LLP were to blame for the best-selling author's money problems, not her lavish spending which included $5m on private jets and a $40,000 per month lease at Trump Tower. Despite earning over $10million a year in book sales, Cornwell is reportedly down to her last $13 million and has been forced to sell off her helicopter, sports cars and several homes in a bid to reduce her debt. Crime fiction author Patricia Cornwell (pictured right with partner Staci Gruber) is at the centre of an epic legal battle against her accountants . Cornwell said she was thrilled with the verdict, saying: 'God bless justice. It's a huge relief and it's been a huge ordeal.' Lawyers for the New York firm and former principal Evan Snapper had said there was no money missing from Cornwell's accounts. They blamed losses on the economic downturn and what they called Cornwell's extravagant lifestyle, which included Ferraris, helicopters and a temporary apartment in New York City she rented for $40,000 per month. But Cornwell, 56, testified that Anchin moved her from a conservative management strategy to an aggressive one without her permission. She said she fired the firm in 2009 after discovering that her net worth was a little under $13 million, despite having eight-figure earnings in each of the previous four years. She had said the firm caused her to miss a book deadline for the first time in her career when it failed to find her a suitable place to write after renovation work on her house in Concord went on much longer than expected. 'This was very destabilizing. I really lost my ability to focus and concentrate. I did not know what the book was about anymore,' Cornwell said. The lawsuit said the missed deadline caused Cornwell to lose one year's income: about $15 million in non-recoverable advances and commission. Cornwell's relationship with Anchin began in 2004. Cornwell said Anchin agreed to manage all her money and the assets of her company, Cornwell Entertainment Inc.  The lawsuit alleged negligence and breach of contract.

But the crime writer, 56, broke off the liaison and later told detectives that Caroline Nicholl, a former chief superintendent with Thames Valley Police, was a threat to her. The American’s relationship with Miss Nicholl was revealed in US court papers alleging that financial managers wasted her multi-million dollar fortune. The women met through a mutual friend and their affair started when Miss Nicholl invited the writer to do research in Milton Keynes, where she was in charge of policing 17 years ago. Miss Nicholl, 57, said: ‘Yes, we did have a relationship. It lasted a matter of months. We must have seen each other probably no more than ten times. ‘She was very smart, self-effacing and charming, and clearly was enamoured that I was a police chief. She thought the uniform was amazing. ‘I didn’t know who she was. I’d never read any of her books. So I was expecting an old biddy or something. ‘The next time we met was when she was on a book tour in London. I invited her up to Milton Keynes because she liked to do research. She was smitten with me and I was smitten with her.’ According to the documents filed in Boston, Miss Cornwell said the affair ‘ended badly’. Cornwell has been forced to sell off a number of luxury sports cars including a Ferrari . The crime writer spent $5million on private jets to ferry her across the country . Defense lawyer James Campbell . said Cornwell's money worries were due to her extravagant lifestyle . which included spending  $1,000-per-day on a car service, a $10 million . renovation project at her Massachusetts estate and the $1.2 million . purchase of a Florida condo. The best-selling crime author also . spent  $40,000 a month for an apartment at Trump Tower in New York City, . $200,000 in taxes alone for her customized, personal helicopter, . $5million for private jets to ferry her across the country and . $11million for private estates in Concord, Massachusetts. She also had . several employees, including one who was paid $100,000. The trial has cast a harsh spotlight on the intensely private 56-year-old. Cornwell lives with her longtime partner, Harvard University neuroscientist Staci Gruber. 'Where . did the money go? Ms Cornwell and Dr Gruber spent the money,' said . Campbell. 'You have to consider the large lifestyles involved, the . spending habits, impulsive buying.' Cornwell's . crime novels, most of which follow Virginia forensic examiner Kay . Scarpetta, have made Cornwell a nationally-recognized name. Her books - . which lean heavily on the use of forensic science - are credited as a . major influence for the TV show 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.' Her novels, including 'Postmortem,' 'Cruel and Unusual' and 'Book of the Dead' have sold more than 100million copies worldwide. This is not the first time Cornwell . has begrudgingly found herself in the spotlight. In the early 1990s, . Cornwell had an affair with Margo Bennett, a married . FBI agent, which came out years later after Bennett's estranged husband . was arrested and convicted for the attempted murder of his wife and the . abduction of her pastor. Wildly popular: Most of Cornwell's novels center around Virginia medical examiner Kay Scarpetta. The novels, which have sold 100million copies worldwide, are credited with introducing the forensic science crime genre . Cornwell has also publicly . revealed that she struggles with bipolar disorder. Her lawyer argues . that she hired Snapper and his firm to insulate herself from her money . and that Snapper knew this and took advantage of her over her . four-and-a-half-year relationship with the company. 'This case is, at its core, about trust,' her lawyer, Joan Lukey, told . the jury. 'There is no amount of money that is enough to properly . compensate her for what Anchin, Block and Anchin did. Cornwell fired the firm after discovering in July 2009 that the net . worth of her and her company, despite having earning above $10million in earnings per . year during the previous four years, was a little under $13million, the . equivalent of only one year's net income. She also claims in the lawsuit that Anchin had borrowed several . million dollars, including mortgages for property and a loan for the . purchase of a helicopter, and had lost millions by moving her from a . conservative investment strategy to high-risk without her permission. She said she also found checks written for expenses she never . authorized, including a $5,000 check for a bat mitzvah gift to Snapper's . daughter from Cornwell, she alleges. Cornwell says problems caused by Anchin and Snapper were so . distracting that they caused her to miss a book deadline for the first . time in her career and cost her $15 million in non-recoverable advances . and commissions. After Cornwell filed the lawsuit in 2009, Snapper pleaded guilty to . violating campaign finance laws by buying $50,000 in tickets to an Elton . John concert benefiting Hillary Rodham Clinton, using Cornwell's money. He paid a fine. Cornwell, a Virginia native, is politically connected herself - though she has preferred to support Republican candidates in the past. She reportedly summered with President George H.W. Bush in Kennebunkport, Maine, and has close family ties to evangelist Billy Graham - even acting as a spokesperson for the family. Lawyers for Anchin and Snapper deny Cornwell's claims. During opening . statements at the trial, attorney Campbell described Cornwell as . 'a demanding client' who 'tends to push off responsibility and assign . blame when things go off track.' 'I do what I do when and how I do it,' she allegedly wrote in an email to Snapper read by Campbell to the jury. Cornwell said one of Anchin's primary functions in 2006 was to ensure that locations were arranged where she could write without distraction while her home was undergoing reconstruction. She said Snapper leased a series of expensive apartments, including one at Trump Tower in New York, that she had to leave long before leases expired because of construction, privacy or other issues. In the lawsuit, Cornwell openly acknowledges her struggles with bipolar disorder, an illness she said has contributed to her belief that she needs other people to manage her business affairs and investments. She said Anchin was aware of her illness.","Patricia Cornwell, 56, sued Anchin, Block & Anchin LLP and money manager Evan Snapper, claiming she lost untold millions .

A British couple are to be deported from Australia next month – because they settled in a suburb that was 2 miles and 854.45 yards from where they were told to set up home. George and Lana Breen today told of their despair at being sent back to Scotland, after migrating to Queensland, 10,400 miles away, five years ago, and each finding jobs that were of benefit to the Australian community. But under the rules of their migration visa they had to live and work in a specified area. Strict rules: George and Lana Breen are being deported from Australia after breaching the terms of their visas by moving to an area three miles away from the location they were allocated to live in . Mr and Mrs Breen, from Dundee, settled in the suburb of Calamvale, south of Brisbane, which is less than three miles from Browns Plains, where they were meant to live. There was good work for the two of them in Calamvale and they were convinced they were doing the right thing in a country that has been asking for skilled and qualified workers. But the Immigration Department was not happy about their choice of suburb and has invoked a little-known rule that they cannot work in any other place other than that initially specified until such time as their full residency visas are approved. ‘When we heard from the immigration that we’d broken the condition of the visa we were shattered,’ Mrs Breen, who works as a disability care specialist, told Channel Seven’s Today Tonight programme. ‘This was not done intentionally.’ Mr Breen, who is working as a much-in-demand bricklayer, was devastated. ‘We work hard, we’ve put in a lot of money, we’ve set up home here, we’ve got vehicles and this is home,’ he said. Strict guidelines mean immigrants can't live in anywhere other than the area stated on their visas . Demography expert Dr Bob Birrell said he believed the visa that ‘controlled’ the Breens was created to soothe the nations’ concerns that migrants were flocking to the capital cities while areas that needed workers were being bypassed. Migrants, he said, weren’t going where they were really needed, so when the Breens were told they had to live in Browns Plains it was expected they would abide by that ruling. Mr Ian Mulvey, who knows the couple well, said Mrs Breen had been looking after his disabled son for three years. Skilled workers or professionals must be nominated by a state or sponsored by an eligible relative living in a designated area to be granted a 475 skilled regional visa in Australia. The visa is valid for four years and only for a designated area in Australia where the applicant's skills are most needed. Workers are allocated a specific area to work in because of concerns migrants were only flocking to big cities to work and weren't helping to fill gaps in workforce. After the four years is up, workers can apply for permanent residency if they wish to stay in Australia. Australia is well-known for its tough stance on immigration. ‘She’s just made a significant difference to his life,’ he told the TV programme. ‘The Australian adage, give someone a fair go…that’s just gone out of the water with all this.’ Mr Greg Robbie, General Manger of the Algester Sports Club, where Mr Breen is a social member, said a petition of 650 had been signed in favour of Mr Breen and his wife staying in Australia. But the Immigration Department has been unmoved. ‘Their particular visa applies to those working and residing in regional Australia and of course regional Australia is determined in our case by postcodes.’ Mr and Mrs Breen said they thought they had obeyed all the conditions of their 475 skilled regional visa and it wasn’t until they applied for permanent residency in 2011 that they found out they were victims of red tape. Desperately, they approached real estate agent Tony Cook looking for place to live in the ‘correct’ suburb. ‘At that time, there was not much available and weren’t able to help and passed them onto other agents who also weren’t able to help,’ said Mr Cook. The Breens appealed to the Migration Review Tribunal but lost their case on the basis that they had breached the terms of their visas. The TV channel said it was hard not to have some sympathy for the British couple when it was known that other migrants are not prevented from moving into suburbs where people of similar nationalities live. Dr Birrill gave as examples Vietnamese migrants who gather in three suburbs in Melbourne, the Chinese who tend to move into a particular Sydney suburb, the Indians in another and the Lebanese in three suburbs. On March 7, said Mr and Mrs Breen, they will be ordered onto a plane and sent back to Scotland.‘We’ve made an awful lot of friends here and to be sent home…I think it’s a bit of a disgrace,’ he said.","George and Lana Breen migrated to Queensland from Dundee in 2008 .

An extreme weather warning has been issued by the Met Office over fears a five day cold snap could ravage the health of the elderly, young children and other vulnerable people. Temperatures will plunge over the next five days, with much of the UK shuddering under temperatures of -2C and -3C, plunging to -6C in some areas. Weather experts issued the 'severe weather action' - one alert level down from a national emergency - over fears the prolonged cold could hit the elderly and sick hard. A Met Office spokesman said: 'The main thing we're concerned with is the cold and how it will have an effect on health, rather than travel and transport' The warning states that: 'Prolonged periods of cold weather can be dangerous, especially for the very young, very old, or those with chronic diseases.' 'This weather could increase the health risks to vulnerable patients and disrupt the delivery of services.' The snap looks set to continue into the . start of next week.

An ex-soldier has been jailed after he falsely claimed £40,000 compensation for falling down steps. Former Royal Engineer Leon Wells, 30, made the claim three years after his accident - and pretended the delay was because he was serving with Special Forces in Afghanistan. But a court heard how Wells was caught out - because he was actually serving a prison sentence for manslaughter. The hearing was told how Wells fell down a set of stairs while on a jog in 2006 and suffered a 'bucket handle tear' in the medial meniscus fibrocartilage in his knee. He filed a claim against Caerphilly Council alleging his knee injury was as a result of their neglect. Prosecutor Gareth Compton said: 'Wells fabricated two witnesses to the accident. 'He claimed one witness assisted him and the other gave him a lift home. 'But . when asked about these claims one witness said he knew nothing of the . accident while the other gave a surprisingly vague and differing . account.' Cardiff Civic . Justice Centre heard how Wells served in the armed forces from the ages . of 16 to 21 and achieved the rank of lance corporal. He had served in Macedonia and Sierra Leone - but left because of stress and started work as a plumber. Wells lodged the compensation claim three years after the alleged slip on the steps. He claimed he was on a tour of duty in Afghanistan. But . it was later revealed he was in HMP Parc for manslaughter after he killed . former miner Alan Brown, 45, by punching him twice in the face in a . fight outside a pub in Tredegar, South Wales in May 2008. Ex-soldier Leon Wells, 30, tried to sue Caerphilly Council for £40,000 for an injury from falling down steps . Alan Brown, 45, who died after being punched by Leon Wells in May 2008 . Father-of-three Mr Brown, from New Tredegar, did not regain consciousness after the attack and died of a brain haemorrhage. The case was finally ready to go to trial in October last year but on the first day of the case he withdrew his claim - incurring legal costs of £61,000. And the council then launched their own private prosecution against Wells after realising he had tried to scam them. Simon Goodman, defending, said: 'In cases of this kind, it often happens that claims are simply made up. 'That is not so on this occasion. This was a genuine claim that was falsely boosted, he stupidly, foolishly gilded the lily. 'This is not a man with a history of deception and dishonesty and he apologies for misleading the court.' Father-of-one Wells, of Abertysswg, near Rhymney, South Wales, admitted contempt of court at the Cardiff Civil Justice Centre. He was sentenced to another four weeks behind bars yesterday after investigators found his case was fraudulent. District Judge Wyn Williams told him: 'Parts of your claim were fraudulent, parts of your evidence were dishonest. 'You made up two witnesses to bolster your case, making up falsehoods of this kind must be dealt with extremely seriously. 'You have acknowledged that you have lost a considerable amount through the false aspects of what you say was a genuine claim for damages. 'You have a very large bill of costs that you must pay at of risk bankruptcy. 'Putting forward false evidence is a very . serious contempt of court and in other cases of this kind invariably . results in a prison sentence. Wells claimed he was serving alongside troops in Afghanistan. But the former lance corporal was serving three years in Parc Prison for killing former miner Alan Brown (file photo) 'There is no reason to depart from that on this occasion.' Keith Reynolds, deputy leader of Caerphilly council, said: ""Mr Wells' claim raised many questions, which required further detailed investigation of the claim. 'Our fraud investigation team screens every insurance claim and uses fraud indicators to look for questionable claims. 'Every penny paid out to fraudsters is a penny less to spend on vital local services for the people of Caerphilly.'","Leon Wells tried to make Caerphilly Council pay out for his fall down steps .

A U.S. soldier today won a major victory in a bitter transatlantic tug-of-love battle with his Scottish ex-wife over custody of their six-year-old daughter. Sergeant Jeffrey Chafin claims Eris Hales Chafin should be living with him in Alabama and not with her mother Lynne Hales 4,000 miles away in Lanarkshire. Today, America’s highest court, the U.S. Supreme Court, sided with Mr Chafin in unanimously dismissing a lower court’s ruling that the child should be allowed to stay in Scotland with her mother. Legal fight: U.S. soldier Jeffrey Chafin (right) has won a major victory in a bitter transatlantic tug-of-love battle with his Scottish ex-wife over custody of their six-year-old daughter, Eris (left) Bitter battle: Sgt Chafin claims his daughter should be living with him in Alabama and not with her mother Lynne Hales (pictured) 4,000 miles away in Lanarkshire . Following the 9-0 decision, Chief . Justice John Roberts wrote for the court: ‘This dispute is very much . alive,’ adding that the Chafins ‘continue to vigorously contest the . question of where their daughter will be raised’. However, the senior U.S. judge noted . that separate custody hearings are already under way in Scotland and . warned that a Scottish court may simply ignore the U.S. Supreme Court . judgment. The increasingly acrimonious fight is . believed to be the first case involving a Scottish individual’s rights . to have reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which only rules on family . matters when they are of national significance. Sgt Chafin, a bomb disposal expert, has questioned his ex-wife’s parenting. Miss Hales, however, says that Eris is . better off with her and that Sgt Chafin has ‘left her with nothing’ because of her huge legal bills. Firing back: Miss Hales says that Eris is better off with her . An earlier hearing in a lower court in . Alabama had awarded Miss Hales custody of Eris after agreeing that, . under a 1980 Hague Convention signed by the U.S. and Britain, . Lanarkshire had been Eris’s ‘habitual residence’ for most of her life, . so she should go back there. A subsequent appeal by Sgt Chafin was . thrown out after the 11th Circuit Court of Appeal ruled the issue was . moot because the girl by then was already in Scotland and beyond its . control. However, when Sgt Chafin took his case . to the Supreme Court it ruled unanimously that the appeals court was . wrong not to have considered the merits of his claim. In a concurring opinion, Justice Ruth . Bader Ginsburg noted the legal confusion arose because the U.S. Congress . did not indicate how custody appeals should be handled under the Hague . Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Adoption. The near two-year delay in Eris’s case ‘is hardly consistent with the convention’s objectives,’ Justice Ginsburg wrote. Lawyers for both parties were unavailable for comment following the decision. Previously, Sgt Chafin said his daughter was being shielded from the row so as not to upset her. He said: ‘It’s not for her to know at . this age. When she’s older she will know, but right now I would just . rather she play with her dolls instead of being concerned about big . court battles.’ Miss Hales, 35, met Sgt Chafin, 42, on . an online dating site while he was stationed in Germany in 2006 and . they were married the following year at Culcreuch Castle Hotel near . Fintry, Stirlingshire. They moved temporarily to Alabama, but . she returned to live in Scotland for a large part of the time while he . was on tours of duty in Afghanistan. Things began to sour between them two . years ago and, while in the U.S., she was arrested on Christmas Eve, . 2010, for allegedly threatening him with a knife, though she denies . this. Not over yet: Sgt Chafin, pictured with Eris, was warned by a Supreme Court judge that a Scottish court may simply ignore their judgment . That month, Miss Hales was also arrested for alleged public drunkenness for apparently getting into a fight with a taxi driver. No charges were brought, but while she . was in custody police realised she was in the U.S. on a 90-day tourist . visa and she was deported. Miss Hales, an administrator, won . ‘humanitarian parole’ from the immigration service and was allowed back . in to attend a hearing in an Alabama court in which she was awarded . custody of Eris. Sgt Chafin has claimed he was only . given 20 minutes to say goodbye to Eris in the court’s car park before . Miss Hales took her back to Scotland. He said: ‘It was horrible. She didn’t know what was going on. She was looking to me for answers and I couldn’t give them to her. ‘Eris is my everything. That’s why I’m fighting so hard to get her back into a safe place.’ Miss Hales said she had been ‘praying’ for the U.S. Supreme Court to rule in her favour.","Highest U.S. court unanimously sides with Sgt Jeffrey Chafin .

A new study conducted by scientists at the University of Vermont has used Twitter to establish that Hawaii is the happiest state in the union and Louisiana the saddest. Looking at 10 million tweets posted from 373 different sites across the country, the team ranked the saddest and happiest states and cities based on the frequency of happy and sad words posted onto the social networking site. Dubbing the mathematical formula created to collate the information as a 'hedonometer', the scientists discovered that Napa, California was the happiest city, while Beaumont in Texas ranked as the most miserable. State in deeper blue are most unhappy according to the 10 million tweets used in the University of Vermont study, while the deep red states are happiest . Out of the 80 million or so words examined, the scientists used Amazon's Mechanical Turk web service to enable them to locate the words they had deemed for their study to be happy or sad. Words such as love, beauty, hope, wonderful and rainbow were designated happy, while boo, ugly, damn, smoke, hate and lied were decided to represent an unhappy state of mind. The study conducted through geographical tweets from 2008 to 2011 revealed that Napa, California was the happiest city in the United States . The beautiful vista of Napa, California - known for wine growing and according to a new study its particularly happy residents . 'Our overall objective is to use web-scale text analysis to remotely sense societal-scale levels of happiness using the singular source of the micro-blog and social networking service Twitter,' the study's introduction says according to The Atlantic. As a broad sweep the study revealed that the Bible belt stretching across the south and into Texas was less happy than the West Coast and New England. However, the exception that proved this rule was Waterbury, Connecticut which has previously appeared on many different 'worst places in the country to live' lists. Explaining the study is a graph below that has the positive and negative phrases next to them and up or down arrows. The plus or minus shows whether the word is considered happy or sad. While the up or down arrow points to whether the word was used more or less so in each city - in this case the happiest, Napa and the saddest, Beaumont. Using the word 's**t' as an example of a negative word, it was clearly used less in Napa than in Beaumont. The bars in the graphs show that the lack of the use of that word in Napa helped it rise to the top, whith the opposite being true for Beaumont. In fact, looking at Beaumont, it is clear to see that the only positive words on its graph or lol and haha, while the rest were negative. How Twitter was used to collate information to determine how happy Napa, California was compared to Beaumont, Texas . Critics of the list point out that using Twitter is not the most scientific or comprehensive way to compile a list such as this. The list does not seem to take into account differences in language use among different cities, states and demographic and gender groups across the country. The University of Vermont scientists identified people with Norwegian ancestry to be happier than African Americans, which could simply mean that Norwegian Americans use breezier language. Cities through the American Rust Belt and South are revealed to make up the unhappiest cities - with Waterbury, Connecticut standing out as an exception . Beaumont, Texas, USA - This Dupont Industries facility was on the top ten list of largest total toxic chemical factories in the 1990s .

Their research placed Louisiana as the happiest state and their survey was based on four-years across 1.3 million people across the country.

"PUBLISHED: . 12:06 EST, 20 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:25 EST, 20 February 2013 . A mother-of-two has said a father accused of killing his six children in a house fire rubbed his hands together and told people he had a plan to win a custody battle against his former mistress. Charlotte Bright told jurors at Nottingham Crown Court that Mick Philpott had told people that he had a plan to get his children back after his mistress Lisa Willis took them with her when she left the home he shared with his wife Mairead in Victory Road, Derby. Jurors have heard that on the day of the fatal house fire that claimed the lives of his and Mairead Philpott's six children last May, Philpott was due to attend a custody hearing over the four children he shared with Miss Willis and a fifth she had from a previous relationship. 'Plan': Charlotte Bright told jurors Mick Philpott, seen left in a court sketch alongside Mairead Philpott and third defendant Paul Mosley, he had a plan to win a custody battle against his former mistress . It is alleged that Philpott and his . wife, along with a third defendant Paul Mosley, started the fatal blaze . at their home in Victory Road in order to frame Miss Willis as the . culprit. Today Ms . Bright told Nottingham Crown Court that in the days leading up to the . fire Philpott said to parents at the school gates: 'I've got a plan. I've got something up my sleeve. She's not getting those kids.' Philpott also told Ms Bright he had received death threats from Miss Willis after she left their relationship. Deadly blaze: Philpott surrounded by the six children whose lives were claimed by the fatal house fire last May . Giving . evidence Ms Bright told jurors: 'I'm not sure whether it was in a phone . call or text but he said it said ""We are going to bomb you or your . house - I believe it was aimed at Mairead"".' Another . parent Denise Beck told the court: 'He said he wasn't going to let Lisa . get away with it - he had something up his sleeve - watch this space.' Accused: Mick and Mairead Philpott are accused along with Paul Mosley of starting the blaze at their Allenton home . Referring . to the upcoming custody hearing, Ms Beck said: 'He was very confident . about Friday. He said ""I can't wait until Friday"".' The jury heard how Philpott had 'bragged and boasted' about the death threats he allegedly received from Miss Willis. Neighbour Charlotte Harriot told the court Philpott appeared 'happy and hyper' when she visited him in the days leading up to the fire. 'He was all happy and hyper and bragging and boasting saying that Lisa had threatened to blow his house up. He was flashing his phone around and saying that he was going to see a solicitor,' she told the court. She added: 'He was just happy that he had it on his phone that they were going to set fire to his house.' Prosecuting Richard Latham QC asked Ms Harriot: 'Did you see his phone?' Miss Harriot replied: 'No.' Cross examining, Mr Philpott's barrister Anthony Orchard QC asked her: 'I'm going to suggest the message said ""leave me, my sister alone or I will kill you"".' Miss Harriot replied: 'No, he didn't tell me that.' The court heard that the first police officer on the scene tried to gain entry to the house but the heat was too intense. PC Amerjit Thandi said he was the first to arrive at the property after the 999 call was taken at 3.46am on May 11 last year. He told the court he used a fire extinguisher to try to put the blaze out through a gap in the white UPVC front door but was driven back by the heat. He said: 'The heat was intense, I could feel it in my face. I was probably around a foot away from the fire.' He gained entry to the back garden of the house from the neighbour's property. PC Thandi said he got into the conservatory and tried to get further into the house but was beaten back when he got as far as the kitchen door. 'I opened it (the kitchen door) slightly and I was hit by the heat of the flames,' he told the court. The officer also said he climbed up a ladder propped up against the back of the house but came down when the fire crews arrived. The jury heard that PC Thandi then went to the front of the house and saw three of the children on a plastic sheet who had been dragged from the burning house. The officer said he helped to provide CPR to one of them. Philpott held his head in his hands and appeared visibly upset as Pc Thandi gave his evidence this afternoon. The officer told the court he travelled with one of the children in the ambulance to the hospital. On arrival at A&E, he said he saw a security guard who was crying. 'He said he was godfather to one of the children.' Mr Latham asked him: 'What name did he give?' 'Brian Mosley,' PC Thandi replied. He said his brother, Paul Mosley, had been at the house the night before and he had called him to tell him the news about the fire. When Paul Mosley arrived at the hospital, he told police he had left the Philpotts' house at 2am on May 11 and walked home. Six siblings Jade, 10, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, Jayden, five, and Duwayne, 13 - all died after the fire which engulfed the Philpotts' home in Allenton in the early hours of Friday May 11 last year. Philpott, 56, his 31-year-old wife and Mosley, 46, have all denied six counts of manslaughter in relation to their children's deaths. The court has heard how Miss Willis lived with the couple as Philpott's mistress along with her four children that were fathered by him and another child she had from a previous relationship. Miss Willis had left the house, taking her five children, after becoming fed up with the domestic situation, jurors have heard. The trial continues.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:37 EST, 20 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:11 EST, 20 February 2013 . The owners of a Utah horse ranch are facing more than 100 neglect charges after deputies acting on a tip discovered three horses buried in a shallow grave, several others so malnourished they couldn't stand, and another stuck in a fence and too weak to break free. Utah County Sheriff's office has arrested Trudy Childs, 59, and her son, Rory Childs, 31, on 101 counts of animal cruelty and 31 counts of livestock at large, Utah County Sheriff's Sgt. Spencer Cannon said. Accompanied by a veterinarian, Utah County Sheriff's visited the Smokey Mountain Ranch in Spanish Fork housing about 100 horses last week after getting a report from a neighbor. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Ranchers: Trudy Childs, left, and her son Rory, right, were arrested and charged with 101 counts of animal cruelty and 31 counts of livestock at large after officials say they had let their horses starve . Desperation: Deputies acting on a tip discovered starving horses stuck to barbed wire fences after trying to get to the trees on the other side so that they could gnaw on the bark . Horrific neglect: A young colt got stuck in a fence and was too weak from starvation to break free . Mass grave: At least four dead animals were found buried in hastily dug graves on the Childses' property . Five of the animals have died in recent weeks and about 12 others are ‘skin and bones, at death's doorstep,’ Cannon said. He said Trudy Childs has told them that 12 horses have died recently from starvation. Utah County Sheriff James Tracy called it one of the largest and most severe cases of animal abuse he has seen in 35 years, according to Desert News. It's the first arrest for Rory Childs, but his mother has been previously charged with animal cruelty and more than 400 counts of livestock at large, Cannon said. Deputies have had regular contact with what he said has been a problematic ranch. Trudy Childs has 24 cases pending against her in 4th District Court. She is facing 165 counts of livestock at large, 38 counts of livestock on a highway, 38 counts of maintaining a public nuisance and one count of cruelty to animals. Rory Childs called the charges false and unfair, and said they'll fight them in court. ‘We've been doing everything we can to keep them fed and get them back healthy,’ Rory Childs said. He said they're stuck in a legal dispute with a ranch near Ogden owned by Linda Barrow and her son Justin Barrow that was supposed to feed and take care of their horses in a contractual agreement they entered into. Unimaginable cruelty: Officials said the horses have lost 300-400lbs over the course of several months . Tragic sight: Five of the animals have died in recent weeks and about 12 others are skin and bones and unlikely to survive . They are unable to sell the horses due to the ongoing case. He said the ranch wasn't feeding the horses, and that they got them back last fall in bad shape. However, Justin Barrows said that the Childs family have not paid them for months, prompting Barrows’ company to file a lawsuit seeking $55,000, the Salt Lake Tribune reported They also put a lien on the horses and intended to sell them to recoup some of the lost income. Childs said their ranch has been in the business of horse breeding for about 30 years, but they were unable to do their annual sale of baby horses last fall due to the legal dispute. Without that money, they haven't been able to pay the $1,500 and $2,000 a week to feed all the animals in their charge, Rory Childs said. On their website, the Childs ask for donations to help feed the horses. Blame game: The Childs family said another ranch was in charge of feeding and caring for the animals, which they had failed to do . But Cannon said the Childs have made no effort to get help or sell the horses. ‘It doesn't matter that they may not have the means to buy the food or the feed for the horses,’ Cannon said. ‘That doesn't absolve them of their responsibility.’ On her Facebook page, Mrs Childs, a mother of four, outlined her ambitions plans for the horse ranch, which included building a large indoor arena with facilities for horse shows, corporate etreats and clinics. ‘We will be seeking investors for a celerbrity re-hab in the near future,’ she wrote. Her son Rory’s Facebook page also paints an idyllic picture of their operation, with the photo gallery crammed with images of healthy-looking, glossy horses and joyous celebrations held on the ranch. Reality, however, has proven to be different. Authorities have been giving the emaciated horses food and water. Cannon said it likely took about six months of consistent malnourishment for the 12 horses near death to get to that state. According to Utah County Sheriff's deputy Sean Peterson, most of the horses have lost 300-400lbs.It will likely take the same amount of time for them to recover, if they do. Cannon said it is likely that more horses will die. There was only one source of water for the horses, and they hadn't been drinking from it, Cannon said. The veterinarian said that's likely because the water was dirty or causing them to get sick, he said. ‘We're not saying they weren't fed at all,’ Cannon said, ‘but were not getting fed enough.’ Trudy and Rory Childs are scheduled to be back in court on February 25. Shocking: Law enforcement officials called the situation uncovered at the ranch one of the largest and most severe cases of animal abuse in decades . Legal woes: Trudy Childs has been previously charged with animal cruelty and more than 400 counts of livestock at large . Uncertain future: The horses rescued from the Childses' ranch cared for by the sheriff's office with the help of local residents, but they could potentially be returned to their owners . On Wednesday, law enforcement  officials inspected four different pastures belonging to the Childs in Spanish Fork, Mapleton and Spanish Fork Canyon, where they came upon horses so emaciated that their ribs and bones could be seen nearly breaking through the skin. Some of the animals were stuck in barbed wire fences after trying desperately to reach trees on the other side so that they could eat the bark. One colt between the ages of six and eight months was so weak from starvation that it couldn't stand up. Cannon said a local veterinarian examined the horses and rated them on a scale from one to nine, with nine being the healthiest. He said all the horses' in the Childses' care were at category one to three. ‘It was sick,’ Peterson told Daily Herald. ’I was born and raised here and have been around horses most of my life. This is the most heartbreaking thing I have ever seen in my whole life.’ The rescued horses are currently being cared for by the sheriff's office with the help of local residents who have been donating feed. Their future, however, remains uncertain at this point. Cannon said the animals could be taken away from the Childses through civil or criminal cases or they could eventually be returned to them.","Trudy and Rory Childs were arrested on 101 animal cruelty charged and 31 counts of livestock at large .

Kennedy in the 1960s turned federal judge, died Thursday on his 94th birthday. This according to Sheldon Snook, a spokesman for the federal court in Washington, who said Oberdorfer died in his sleep. His long career saw him defend everything from civil rights to the right of free speech for Ku Klux Klan members. Long career: Louis F. Oberdorfer died Feb. 21 on his 94th birthday after a storied career as a lawyer and judge . Oberdorfer was appointed to the court in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter and took senior status in 1992, meaning he continued to hear cases but fewer of them. He heard cases until several years ago. He had two strokes in recent years, said Judge Royce C. Lamberth, the Chief Judge of the U.S District Court for the District of Columbia. As a judge, Oberdorfer authored more than 1,300 opinions. In the late 1980s, one of his rulings pushed the U.S. Defense Department to extend veteran status to thousands of men who sailed merchant ships during World War II. Beginnings: Oberdorfer rose to the national stage as Assistant Attorney General to Robert F. Kennedy in 1961 . In 1990, he issued a ruling ordering the District of Columbia to give the Ku Klux Klan permission to march to the U.S. Capitol. He also made headlines for ignoring mandatory minimum prison terms for crack cocaine crimes. Congress has since changed the law, which came to be seen as unfair. For years, Oberdorfer also oversaw cases involving Vietnamese orphans who were hurt in a plane crash in 1975 during the United States' ‘Operation Babylift.’ Lockheed Aircraft Corp. eventually paid millions to the victims. In 2000, Oberdorfer was part of a three-judge panel that heard a lawsuit by District of Columbia residents arguing it was unconstitutional they weren't allowed to elect representatives to Congress. Two judges agreed city residents were being treated unequally but said they couldn't do anything to fix the situation. Federal bench: Oberdorfer was appointed to the federal bench by President Jimmy Carter in 1977 and authored over 1,300 opinion . Oberdorfer, however, wrote a partial dissent saying Washington residents should get to elect members to the House of Representatives. Oberdorfer grew up in Birmingham, Ala., and graduated from Dartmouth College. After getting a law degree from Yale, studies that were interrupted by his Army service during World War II, he clerked for Supreme Court Justice Hugo L. Black during the term that ran from 1946 to 1947. In 1961, he became an Assistant Attorney General for Kennedy's Justice Department, where he oversaw the tax division. In 1963, he helped organize the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which sent hundreds of lawyers to the South to support the civil rights movement. He left the Justice Department in 1965. Oberdorfer argued before the Supreme Court on several occasions, including a 1969 case in which Mississippi was told to desegregate its schools.",His long career saw him champion causes from civil rights in the 1960s South to free speech for Ku Klux Klan members in the 1990s .

The Toyota Yaris has been named as the vehicle in which you are most likely to get injured if involved in a car crash, claims an insurance industry study. The Highway Loss Data Institute compared insurance data for the 2009-2011 model years and found Yaris occupants filed personal injury claims 28.5 times for every 1,000 of the vehicles the industry insured. The car with the best safety rate using . the same measurement was the Porsche 911 sports car, which had only 4.5 . injury claims for every 1,000. Unwanted achievement: The Toyota Yaris had a higher rate of personal injury claims than any other car, according to the Highway Loss Data Institute . Safest auto? The Porsche 911 had the lowest rate of personal injury claims - only 4.5 claims per 1,000 insured vehicles . ‘Toyota is committed to achieving the highest standards for safety and is proud of its industry-leading 18 Toyota, Lexus and Scion models, including the Yaris, named 2012 ‘Top Safety Picks’ by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety,’ Toyota spokesman Brian Lyons told The L.A. Times. The institute said its research clearly demonstrated that the vehicles with the highest injury claims tend to be small cars, while also proving an important alternative to the crash tests conducted by federal safety regulators and the insurance industry. ‘Injury claims data shows something that crash test results can’t, and that’s the role that vehicle size plays,’ said Kim Hazelbaker, HLDI senior vice president. ‘In most crash tests, the advantage of greater size and weight is masked by using a fixed barrier [in a test].  As a result, crash test results are comparable only among similar vehicles.’ These numbers demonstrate which vehicles' occupants are the most likely to be injured in when it comes to real crashes, the institute said. ‘We know that in the real world, if all else is equal, a larger, heavier vehicle does a better job protecting occupants than a smaller, lighter one,’ Hazelbaker said. The Suzuki SX4, a small crossover, had the second-highest risk of injury to its occupants, posting 26.6 claims per 1,000 insured vehicle years. The Suzuki SX4 crossover had the second-highest injury claim rate: 26.6 per 1,000 SX4s . The Chevrolet Aveo subcompact had the third-worst record, logging 26 injury claims per 1,000 insured Aveos . Other vehicles that scored poorly by the institute's measurement included the Chevrolet Aveo, Mitsubishi Galant, Kia Rio, Nissan’s Versa and Sentra, Hyundai Accent and the Dodge Avenger. ‘There are many factors that can influence claim rates and we will study the results to determine if the data can provide us with useful information for future safety developments,’ said a Nissan statement. The company had two cars on the list of the worst 10. ‘Nissan has a longstanding commitment to safety and innovation and continues to explore enhancements to safety technology even beyond conventional safety technologies. We believe that the Nissan Sentra and Versa provide excellent crash protection and safety to its occupants in the real world,’ the automaker said. Vehicles that scored well included the Chevrolet Corvette and Silverado, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Lexus LX 570, Mercedes-Benz SL-class convertible, Ford F-150, Land Rover Range Rover and Cadillac Escalade. The Mitsubishi Galant sedan ranked fourth with a reported 25.4 injury claims per 1,000 insured Galants . The Kia Rio came in at No. 5 for personal injury claims with 24.9 injuries per 1,000 insured vehicles . The institute also looked at which vehicles suffered the highest dollar amount of physical damage in a crash. Not surprisingly, the $200,000 Ferrari California fared the worst.  Although there were just 2.6 claims per every 100 of the Ferraris, each claim averaged $82,112. That was five times the second-worst vehicle, the Maserati Granturismo, which suffered an average $16,150 of damage in a collision. Expensive cars topped the list, but the institute also looked at the results for vehicles that are priced under $30,000. The Mitsubishi Lancer ranked poorly both in claims frequency and the amount of damage inflicted per incident. The Lancer averaged $6,221 per claim. Other vehicles that had high claims and losses were the Hyundai Genesis coupe, the Suzuki Kizashi four-wheel drive sedan and the Subaru Impreza WRX. ‘For consumers concerned about insurance premiums, this information is key,’ Hazelbaker said. ‘A lot of things go into your premium - your age, place of residence, driving record, sometimes even your credit history. The kind of vehicle you buy is the one factor that a consumer can control in the short term.’","Car with highest rate of personal injury claims is Toyota Yaris .

The couple made a will in October 2009, naming each other as beneficiary if one of them died, with their assets valued at £356,000 and, after liabilities, an estate worth £230,000 . Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, described how Seddon set out to ‘execute’ his parents and then cover his tracks. He said: ‘They had each been shot at close range with a sawn-off shotgun. ‘In the immediate aftermath of these . executions, the killer had taken steps to make it look as if the person . responsible was in fact, Robert Seddon. ‘The person responsible not only wanted rid of Robert and Patricia Seddon – he wanted to lay a false trail. ‘A trail he hoped would lead away rather than towards a man with a considerable motive to kill these two people. ‘That man was their son, the defendant, Stephen Seddon.’ The jury heard Seddon first attempted to kill his parents by faking a car accident last March. Despite the elderly and caring couple gifting their son £40,000 in cash and buying his home to keep a roof over his head, his parents 'had to die' because he stood to inherit everything in their wills, it is alleged . He shot them both at close range - then planted the gun in his father's lap to make it look like a murder-suicide at the family home in Sale, Greater Manchester, the court was told . He was at the wheel of a hired BMW . when it plunged into a canal as he took his parents and severely . disabled nephew Daniel, 17, to a surprise Mother’s Day meal. He was on a ‘short cut’ to the . restaurant alongside the Bridgewater Canal in Timperley, Manchester, . when the car veered off the road. His nephew managed to free himself . and Seddon was seen on the roof of the car, trying to kick the windows . in and shouting for help. However he went on to give ‘many and varied’ accounts of what had happened. Forensic teams outside the house where the couple are believed to have been shot in Sale, Greater Manchester . Seddon had been out of work since October 2011 and by March the following year was under financial pressure . He told a police officer at the scene . he had suffered a heart attack and blacked out. But hospital tests . indicated he had no heart problem. Seddon also suggested the car had hit . a brick, but no debris could be found and experts thought it would be . ‘highly improbable’ for that to be the cause of the crash. Mr Wright described Seddon as ‘doubly . fortunate’ to be carrying a lock knife and crook-lock he used to cut . his seatbelt and break the windows. Following the incident Seddon, from Seaham, County Durham, was put forward for a bravery award. Mr Wright said: ‘Mr Seddon was portrayed as a hero and he was happy to . perpetuate this myth. The accolades…did little to alleviate his . financial problems. ‘He needed to resort to more severe . methods to bring about their deaths, which were not a terrible tragedy . but rather a double murder at the hands of an ungrateful son.’ The jury . heard Mr and Mrs Seddon lived a ‘modest but comfortable’ life in Sale, . Greater Manchester. They were sole carers for their grandson, Daniel, . after their daughter Lesley, 40 died in 2008. Their will named each other as . beneficiary, with an estate worth £230,000. But the court heard that if . both died, Seddon ‘got the lot’. ‘That’s why they both had to die,’ Mr Wright added. Seddon, who lived with his wife Nicola and three children, had been out of work since October 2011. Mr Wright continued: ‘He had money problems and an insatiable thirst for . cash. He was the sole beneficiary of their will but, in order to . inherit, he needed them both dead.’ The trial continues.

A couple who allowed their chipmunks to die from malnutrition and kept the rest of their pets in 'horrendous' squalor have been banned from keeping animals for ten years. The emaciated bodies of five pet chipmunks were found in cages as the RSPCA searched the filthy home of Becky Carr, 20, and her ex-partner Anthony Collins, 23, on August 9 last year. The house was described as being in an unfit state for humans and animals by the RSPCA and was strewn with faeces and soaked with urine, with broken glass covering the floor. The couple left their pets to live in squalor as they bickered over who kept which animal . Carr and Collins allowed five of their chipmunks to die from malnutrition and kept the rest of their pets in 'horrendous' squalor . Darlington Magistrates' Court heard that police were initially called to the couple's home in Ushaw Moor, County Durham after reports of a domestic incident. However when officers arrived, they found two Staffordshire Bull Terriers, a four-month-old kitten, three Corn Snakes and one live chipmunk amongst the five dead dead ones, living in the filthy conditions. Michael Bosomworth, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said: 'What the police found in the house was to say the least disturbing.' RSPCA inspectors were called and the dogs, named Chico and Fizz, we found to be suffering from untreated ear infections, while Barney the kitten was underweight and had fleas and worms. Two Staffordshire Bull Terriers that were left in filthy conditions, (left); and an underweight kitten (right) The corn snakes were also not being kept at a suitable temperature and the remaining Chipmunk had no food or water in its cage. Mr Bosomworth said the pair had recently split up and could not agree who should look after which animal. At an earlier hearing, the pair were found guilty in their absence of five charges of failing to ensure animal welfare and one charge of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal. Michelle Gallagher, mitigating for Collins, from Hartlepool, said: 'He did try his best in very difficult circumstances but he had accepted that his best wasn't enough.

Magistrates sentenced them both to 12 weeks in custody, which was suspended for 12 months and disqualified them both for keeping animals for ten years. Carr was also ordered to complete 40 hours of unpaid work, while Collins was given a curfew. Speaking after the case, RSPCA Inspector Clare Wilson said: 'The house was horrendous. It was not somewhere I would want animals, and I wouldn't expect humans to live somewhere like that.'","Ex-partners Becky Carr and Anthony Collins left their pets as they fought over who got custody of them .

John Coatman has been awarded nearly £70,000 after winning an unfair dismissal case against Salford Council for being sacked after raising concerns about inaccuracies in a report about children at risk of abuse . A council worker sacked after pointing out inaccuracies in a report about children at risk of abuse has been awarded £67,995 in an unfair dismissal case. John Coatman, 59, received the payout after a battle with Salford Council, which started in 2008. He says the case caused him so much stress he suffered a stroke. But Mr Coatman, from Salford, has now said it felt 'fantastic' to know he had won 'after years of hell'. He said: 'Even though the tribunal was a success I still wasn't sure I'd get the pay-out I felt I deserved, so this is very important to me. 'I would have taken £50,000 three years earlier if they had offered it, but this has caused me years of stress.' Mr Coatman won his case after an employment tribunal, which began in September 2011. It heard that he emailed a top Salford council director in 2008 over concerns that figures in his line manager's report on the safety of children at risk of abuse were inaccurate. The council's children's services department was under pressure at the time because it was deemed 'inadequate' by government inspectors. Mr Coatman, a statutory returns analyst, says he raised concerns but they were dismissed and his manager asked him to lie about the figures - which his manager denied before the tribunal. But the tribunal heard Mr Coatman was 'disgusted' and sent an email raising his concerns to Jill Baker - then director of the department. He also sent the email to Ofsted, the Audit Commission and Government Office North West. The figures were eventually rectified, but Mr Coatman alleged that after sending the emails he was threatened with disciplinary action, subjected to intimidating behaviour by some staff and forced to move desks before being suspended. His managers said they suspended him for allegedly communicating with colleagues in a highly inappropriate and threatening manner and failing to follow management requests. At a disciplinary hearing, it was alleged the council's trust and confidence in Mr Coatman had broken down. He claimed the allegations were malicious and took the council to a tribunal, which ruled his dismissal was unfair. His award takes into account loss of earnings and pension over three years. Stress: Mr Coatman said the case has caused him so much stress he suffered a stroke . In 2009, Mr Coatman was admitted to Salford Royal hospital suffering from a minor stroke. He said: 'The doctors couldn't work it out because I was physically fit, I played football and worked out, but then they asked if I'd been experiencing stress, and of course I had. It has been very, very difficult.' Mr Coatman has since found a new job with a management consultancy firm. He said: 'I am enjoying being in work again and even more so because my colleagues are great to work with.' Councillor John Merry, who oversees children's services, said: 'We are in a different place now to when Mr Coatman was employed at the council and action has been taken to improve the service. Ofsted has recently lifted the improvement notice and congratulated officers for the good progress made in the last two years.' Inaccuracies: Mr Coatman says he raised concerns but they were dismissed, and his manager asked him to lie about the figures - which his manager denied.

We spend our working lives looking forward to an old age in which we can happily indulge in holidays and hobbies – but now it seems the typical nest egg put aside will vanish just seven years after retirement. The result is that average Briton will have to contend without any savings at all for the final 12 years of life, a report warns today. And the research by HSBC revealed that people in the UK are less prepared for  retirement that any of 14 other countries which took part in the poll. Few years of fun: Most people in the UK only save enough money for their first seven years of retirement . The average Briton wants to retire ‘punctually’ at 65 and believes they would need about £22,500 a year to live comfortably. This could come from State pension, company pension, income from savings and dividends from investments. But the report warns that savings will typically run out after seven years. For those retiring at 65, their nest egg will have shrunk to zero by the age of 72. However, average life expectancy is 84 – leaving 12 years after the nest egg is gone. But for many the gap will be even longer. The most common age of death in England and Wales is 85 for men and 89 for women, according to the Office for National Statistics. It means the typical man will be left to survive without any savings for 13 years – and the typical woman for 17 years. No gold in silver years: Britons do not save enough money for their retirement, a survey has found . When asked how they would like to spend their retirement, common answers were ‘frequent’ holidays, home improvements and learning new hobbies. But a desperate lack of cash is likely to sabotage such plans for those who are left with just the income from their pension. Yet few of working age are prepared to make the necessary sacrifice for the future. Just 32 per cent said they would prioritise saving for retirement over taking a holiday if they had to make the choice one year. The gap is ‘the worst identified by the international study’, which also looked at Australia, the US, Canada, Singapore and China among other countries. No cash: The reluctance to save for retirement mean that the average Brit will stand with an empty account for their last 12 years in life . A typical pensioner around the world will run out of savings far later than in Britain – ‘just over halfway’ through retirement. Christine Foyster of HSBC said: ‘People are putting off the inevitable, which is the reality of significant cuts to their living standards in their twilight years after their savings run out.’ Last night, pensions minister Steve Webb said the report was ‘a startling reminder of the problems we are facing by failing to save for our retirement’. Joanne Segars, chief executive of the National Association of Pension Funds, said: ‘The UK needs to do more to face up to saving for its old age. ‘For millions of people, that will mean working longer or saving more, or both. ‘Too many people will retire only to find they have to significantly downgrade their lifestyle because they do not have  enough savings.’","People in the UK are badly prepared for their retirement, survey finds .

On trial: Jakir Uddin has been accused of helping an ex-fiance of socialite Tamara Ecclestone blackmail her for £200,000 by claiming he would sell his story to a newspaper . A man accused of helping an ex-fiance of socialite Tamara Ecclestone blackmail her for £200,000 by claiming he would sell his story to a newspaper told a court today he thought it would be good work experience for his media studies degree. Prosecutors claim Jakir Uddin, 20, sent an email to Miss Ecclestone’s then manager Dana Malmstrom in November 2011 pretending to be co-defendant Derek Rose’s official representative. In it he claimed a tabloid newspaper had offered Rose, 33, who went out with Miss Ecclestone, 28, when she was 17, £200,000 for details of their relationship. But no newspaper had made such an offer. Giving evidence today at their trial at London’s Southwark Crown Court, Uddin told jurors he had looked up to Rose, who was more than 12 years his senior. Uddin said Rose had helped with the lifestyle magazine he had set up with a friend while studying at Coventry University. The older man had introduced him to celebrities and given him advice drawn from his own experience in working in the media industry, Uddin told the court. 'I regarded him as someone with a high status in the media,' he said. Uddin told jurors he had filmed Rose talking about his relationship with the eldest daughter of Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone for a university project. But Uddin said that when it was rejected by his tutor, Rose suggested to him that they offered it to the newspapers. 'I saw it as a sort of favour for Mr Rose,' he said. Accused: Derek Rose (pictured left arriving at court today) went out with Miss Ecclestone (right) when she was 17 . 'I’d never contacted the papers before and it was an opportunity for me.' Uddin, who denies a charge of blackmail, said: 'Mr Rose pointed out to me that the story could be worth a quarter of a million pounds.' Asked by his defence lawyer Ali Bajwa QC if they discussed how much money he himself would get, Uddin told the court: 'In general terms maybe a quarter, maybe half. It was just sort of brushed under the carpet.' Asked by Mr Bajwa how he became involved in writing the email to Miss Ecclestone’s agent, the softly-spoken student said: 'Mr Rose sold me the idea that it would give me experience. Romance: Uddin told jurors he had filmed Rose talking about his relationship with the eldest daughter of Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone for a university project . 'That it would give me an opportunity to speak with someone who was in a high position in the industry that I wanted to go into.' Uddin denied he meant any harm against Miss Ecclestone, telling the court: 'If Tamara was unhappy with anything, I wouldn’t have wanted anything to do with it.' Prosecutors claim Rose was the 'driving force' behind the plot and planned to keep £150,000 if they were successful. Both men blame each other over the scheme. Rose, from Camden, London, and Uddin, from Birmingham, both deny blackmail. Rose had already sold one story about Miss Ecclestone to the Mail on Sunday for £10,000 in 2002. The pair had split up in August of that year, when Rose was then named Jonathan Ketterman. An email he sent to Miss Ecclestone after they broke up was previously shown to the jury. The three pages were not read aloud in court but were described by prosecutor William Boyce QC as 'extraordinarily offensive'. Asked by Mr Bajwa if he had known about it, Uddin said he had not, but had seen it since being arrested. Questioned about what he thought of the letter, Uddin said: 'Really unpleasant, unattractive. 'You could feel there was some sort of clear anger towards her.' Asked if he would have become involved in the plot if he had known of it, Uddin told the court: 'I wouldn’t have taken part. 'I didn’t want to get in between a volatile sort of relationship.' The court previously heard that Uddin had spoken to Sun journalist Alex West about selling Rose’s story to the tabloid and they had been given an offer of £10,000. Defendant: Prosecutors claim Rose was the 'driving force' behind the plot and planned to keep £150,000 if they were successful . Uddin said Rose told him they 'should see if Tamara would be interested in purchasing the story or not'. Mr Bajwa said the £200,000 mentioned in the email to Miss Ecclestone’s agent was a 'grossly exaggerated' figure in comparison. But Uddin said that when he sent the email - that it is claimed had been drafted by Rose for him to then check for spelling or grammatical mistakes - he had not read it that thoroughly. He told the court that while his own punctuation and grammar were of a high standard, Rose’s were 'very poor'. 'In hindsight and looking back it's the most stupidest thing I have ever done. It was very naive of me. I let someone have a lot of influence over me. I didn't think for myself. It was stupid' - Jakir Uddin . Uddin told the court he had not thought of the implications of the email he had sent. 'I thought we were only inviting Tamara and Ms Malmstrom for a discussion. 'At the time things were moving really quickly and I just didn't have much time to think.' But he added that, since he has had time to think about it, he has realised it was wrong. 'I wouldn't send this to my worst enemy,' he said. 'It was very displeasing. Very shameful and very, very stupid of me. 'I wouldn't write with such punctuation and grammatical errors.' Asked by his lawyer why he did not go to police after news of a blackmail plot hit the headlines in December 2011, he said it was because Rose had told him not to and he 'panicked'. 'In that time in my life I was taking a lot of advice from Mr Rose. I looked up to him quite a lot,' he said. Implications: Uddin told the court he had not thought of the implications of the email he had sent . He said Rose had advised him to delete any emails between them concerning the plot but he did not do so as he felt he had done nothing wrong. Asked how he felt now, Uddin, who is now in the third year of his media production degree, told jurors: 'In hindsight and looking back it's the most stupidest thing I have ever done. It was very naive of me. 'I let someone have a lot of influence over me. I didn't think for myself. It was stupid.

"By . Lydia Warren . PUBLISHED: . 06:30 EST, 24 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:15 EST, 24 May 2012 . A man has reportedly claimed he lured six-year-old Etan Patz with candy, before stabbing him to death and chopping up his body - nearly 33 years after the boy vanished as he walked to the bus from his Manhattan home. Pedro Hernandez, who worked as a shopkeeper and lived just blocks from Etan at the time of the boy's disappearance, reportedly told police he dumped the youngster's remains in the garbage. Investigators swooped on him in Camden, New Jersey on Wednesday evening after a relative tipped off police that Hernandez had admitted to killing a boy shortly after Etan vanished. Missing: Six-year-old Etan Patz vanished on the way to the school bus in 1979 and has never been found. Police have questioned a man who claims he stabbed the boy and dumped his body . The relative only called police after investigators excavated the basement of Othniel Miller, a handyman who had known Etan, in search for evidence last month. None was found. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said in a statement on Thursday that the man 'has made statements to NYPD detectives implicating himself in the disappearance and death of Etan Patz 33 years ago' Commissioner Kelly added that further details would be released later today. According to a source speaking to The New York Post, Hernandez told investigators he had enticed the boy with sweets, stabbed him, cut up his body and put him in plastic bags. But in a conflicting report from The Associated Press, another source said Hernandez claimed he suffocated the boy and left the body in a box in a Manhattan alleyway. After moving to New Jersey shortly after, Hernandez told family members he had killed a boy but did not mention his name, sources said. He also told a spiritual adviser in the 1980s about killing a child. The confession led a relative to call police after the high-profile search of Miller's SoHo basement. Unsolved: Etan Patz vanished on the way to the school bus in SoHo, New York City in May 1978 . Police told DNAinfo.com they have no hard evidence to support the confession. But if true, the claims - which come almost exactly 33 years after Etan vanished - could solve a case that shocked America and raised awareness of the plight of missing children across the country. It will also bring closure to Etan's parents, Julie and Stanley, who have not moved from their SoHo home since his disappearance in the hope that he will someday return. The revelations come a day short of the anniversary of his disappearance; he was last seen on May 25, 1979 as he walked to the bus stop - the first time his parents had let him go alone. It sparked an international manhunt and he became the first child whose 'missing' photo appeared on the side of a milk carton. May 25 is now National Missing Children's Day. He was officially declared dead in 2001. In May 2010, the Manhattan district attorney’s office said they were taking a fresh look at the decades-old case of the missing six-year-old. Questions: In the 1980s, Jose Ramos, right, was identified as a prime suspect but no hard evidence has ever linked him to the crime. Last month, police searched the basement of handyman Othniel Miller, left . Search: In April, police swooped on Miller's basement - under the blue tarp - in a renewed search for evidence . Just weeks ago, police launched an intensive search for the missing boy when they dug up the basement workshop of Miller, who knew the six-year-old from the area. Miller, now 75, was questioned several times by police after his ex-wife told them about the alleged rape of his niece. He 'sky rocketed to the top of the list' of suspects after the claims, police said. The missing boy's mother, Julie Patz, was also said to have told agents to look again at the handyman, who befriended Etan before he vanished and hired Ramos to do odd jobs for him. Concrete had been laid over the foundation of the basement shortly after the youngster vanished - but the search did not yield any new evidence. When authorities told Miller cadaver dogs picked up the scent of human remains at his basement he allegedly blurted out: 'What if the body was moved?' In light of the claims by Hernandez, Michael Farkas, Miller's lawyer, told the Post he 'has said all along that Miller had nothing to do with the case'. Renewed search: The FBI searched the basement belonging to Miller, a handyman who knew Etan from the area, after his ex-wife claimed he had raped his niece. The search yielded no new evidence . Hope: Investigators sent off concrete, which was laid down shortly after Etan's disappearance, for analysis . '[Miller] has nothing to do with this latest suspect, that I know of,' Farkas added. While no one has ever been arrested or charged with Etan's disappearance, Jose Ramos - a drifter whose girlfriend was the boy's babysitter - was identified as a prime suspect in 1985. Jailed for an unrelated crime, Ramos, 68, later told a prison cell mate he knew every stop of the bus route that took Etan to school and knew the six-year-old got off at the third stop. He admitted to taking a boy back to his apartment to rape him on the day Etan disappeared, but he said he let the boy go. He said he was '90 per cent sure' it was the same boy he later saw on TV. No hard evidence has linked him to the crime. He is now in a Pennsylvania jail on a 20-year sentence for abusing two boys and is due to be released in November. Etan's father has previously said: 'Jose Antonio Ramos is the man who abducted my child. We lost our child to a pedophile, and that's not comprehensible.' Pain: Stanley Patz, Etan's father, watched over the search from the family's home half a block away . Grief: Julie Patz watches the search for clues to her son's disappearance in April from her window . Family: After the disappearance in 1979, Julie Patz, left, appeared on a number of TV shows to try to find her son. Right, Stan Patz, holds a photo of Etan as he poses with his other son Ari . Along with Etan's mother Julie, Stanley Patz watched over the search in April from their apartment just half a block away. They have never moved from their home, in the hope their son would one day find his way back. Nor have they changed their phone number, as Etan knew it off by heart. His father said another reason they did not want to move was because of their other two children, Shira, who was eight at the time of the disappearance, and Ari, two. Stanley and Julie Patz have continued to fight for a legal resolution to their son’s death. In 2000 they spoke with CBS's 60 Minutes about their refusal to give up hope. Julie Patz said at the time: 'We have his belongings all over the house. To put them away, it seems to us and to our children that he's gone and he's not coming back.' Convinced that Ramos is guilty of the crime, Stan Patz sends him a copy of the missing child poster twice a year with the words 'What have you done with my little boy' written on the back. Police said they expect to provide further details on the new developments later today. Etan’s disappearance came before a time when the faces of missing children would peer out from milk cartons and TV movies explored a seeming epidemic of vanishing children. The only small comfort his parents ever received from their son's abduction was knowing that it had become the catalyst in the search for missing children. His disappearance prompted such an extensive search that by 1985, it had taken in the whole of America, parts of Europe and even reached Israel. May 25, the day Etan disappeared, is National Missing Children's Day, which was named by President Reagan in 1983 in honor of the missing six-year-old. An entire network for tracking missing children emerged since then, including Amber Alerts and pictures on milk cartons - Etan's was the first picture of a missing child to ever be put on a milk carton. After 30 years the case is still officially open and the world has never forgotten the face of the blue-eyed, blond-haired boy who captivated a nation. Each administration since Reagan has honored the annual reminder to the nation to renew efforts to reunite missing children with their families and make child protection a national priority. On the day he disappeared, the school noted Etan's absence but did not notify his parents. It wasn't until 3.30pm his mother Julie realized he was missing and called police. His father Stan, a professional photographer, dispatched black-and-white photographs of Etan in an effort to find him. The massive search and media attention that followed focused the nation’s attention on the problem of child abduction and lack of plans to address it after it became apparent there was no coordinated effort between federal, state, and local law enforcement, no national response system in place and no central resource to help searching families. Etan's parents have since become outspoken advocates for missing children. For years, they refused to change their phone number, in the hope that Etan was alive somewhere, and might call. They never moved in the hope he would return home.","Pedro Hernandez lived just blocks from Etan when he disappeared .

Starved: Robert Byrd died from malnutrition and neglect in May last year after he and his seven-year-old brother were tortured by their uncle . A four-year-old boy died weighing less than two stone after being beaten, handcuffed and denied food by his abusive uncle, a jury trying the child's aunt for murder has heard. Robert Byrd died from malnutrition and neglect in May last year after he and his seven-year-old brother Anthony Jr were tortured by Randy Gardner. Gardner was jailed for 30 to 60 years after pleading guilty to second-degree murder, but his wife Matilda Brown Gardner is on trial after she denied killing the boy. Brown Gardner, of Highland Park, Michigan, faces charges of first-degree premeditated murder, felony murder and first-degree child abuse in Robert's death. The jury has begun deliberating in the case, the Detroit Free Press reported. Robert weighed 21lbs at the time of his death - barely more than half the weight of an average boy his age, according to statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He was said to have skin erosions and bruises on about 90 per cent of his body. A pathologist testified that the boy had chemical burns from sitting in urine and faeces. Wayne County Assistant Prosecutor Lora Weingarden told jurors in her closing argument that Brown Gardner aided her husband by not reporting the abuse or stepping in to prevent it. Ms Weingarden said that, days before Robert's death, Brown Gardner spoke to a nurse at Children's Hospital in Detroit and lied about her name as she said Robert had flu-like symptoms. 'She sees he's dying and calls Children's Hospital, lies about her name because she's seen what the child's body looks like and she knew she would be in trouble,"" the prosecutor said. 'She wanted that child to die.' Robert and Anthony Jr moved in with the Gardners in 2007 after their mother died of a brain aneurysm. In court: Robert's uncle Randy Gardner, left, has admitted murder, torture and child abuse. His wife Matilda Brown Gardner denies killing the child . Brown Gardner was awarded guardianship in 2009. Ms Weingarden told the jury that the Gardners' own four boys were the appropriate weight and height for their ages, but Robert and Anthony Jr were not. The court heard that Robert was born weighing less than 4lb but was up to 1st 5lb when his mother took him to a doctor's appointment less than a year later. Ms Weingarden said that Brown Gardner took Robert to the hospital to be treated for asthma in April 2010 and, on that visit, he weighed 2st and had loop marks on his body. Doctors failed to report the marks and low weight to Children's Protective Services.Ms Weingarden said: 'Everyone knows you have to feed a child or there will be severe medical issues.' Brown Gardner's attorney, Robert Kinney, told the jury that she herself was a victim of abuse and was not responsible for the Robert's death. In his closing statement, Mr Kinney said that Brown Gardner was afraid of her husband, whom she had known since she was a teenager. She was once slapped for questioning him, the lawyer added. 'Randy Gardner was a monster,' Kinney said. Defence: A lawyer for Brown Gardner (right) told the court that she was afraid of her husband and was once slapped for questioning him . Carl Schmidt, Chief Pathologist for the Wayne County Medical Examiner’s Office, testified in June that Robert’s injuries likely stemmed from being beaten and bound over time, as well as chemical burns from sitting in urine and faeces, the Examiner reported . Food had probably been withheld from the boy for months, Dr Schmidt added. At Wayne County Circuit Court last month, Gardner was sentenced for murder, torture and child abuse. Robert's father, Anthony Byrd Sr, addressed the court on that occasion. Mr Byrd said: 'I’m still, like, messed up in the head right now, why did my son have to go out like that?'

Witnesses described the aftermath when an 'ungrateful son' allegedly tried to kill his parents for a £230,000 inheritance by driving them into a canal, a court heard today. Stephen Seddon, 46, is accused of staging the 'accident' by driving into a Manchester canal with his father Robert Seddon, 68, mother Patricia, 65, and nephew Daniel, 27, all aboard the BMW car. The father-of-three from Seaham, County Durham, who had an 'insatiable thirst' for his parents' money, was the sole beneficiary of their £230,000 estate and stood to get the lot in their will. 'Insatiable thirst': Bob and Patricia Seddon were been found dead in what was at first a suspected murder-suicide. Their son, Stephen, 46, right, is on trial over their deaths . The court heard Bob Seddon, 68, suspected that a earlier car crash into a canal was an attempt by his son . to kill him and his wife Patricia, 65 . Tragic: The couple's bodies were discovered after a neighbour raised the alarm and police broke into their house in Manchester . Seddon later played the hero after his . parents survived the alleged canal murder plot so he later completed . the double-killing, Manchester Crown Court heard. The elderly, quiet and unassuming . couple were found blasted at close range with a sawn-off shotgun at the . family's suburban home in Sale, Greater Manchester on July 4 last year. Four months earlier on March 20, . Seddon made the first unsuccessful attempt to get his hands on their . money by allegedly staging the canal crash. He told police later a brick in the road may have caused him to swerve off the road and into the water. Seddon hired a BMW and drove from his . home in the North East on the pretext of taking his parents and nephew, . who has learning difficulties, out for a belated Mother's Day meal. Ruth Carroll told the court she was . driving along Canal Road in Timperley, south Manchester, around 8pm on a . dark, cold but dry night when she noticed headlights of a car being . driven fast coming towards her 'all of a sudden.' Health problems: Patricia Seddon was left unconscious after the crash, and was rushed to a nearby hospital . Suffering: The couple narrowly escaped tragedy in March after their car plunged into Bridgewater Canal . Hard times: The couple had both suffered health issues and lost their daughter three years ago . 'At the time I thought it might be joyriders - just the speed,' she told the court. 'The lights sort of went off to my left and I saw the side of the vehicle, then it seemed to go up and it went into the canal.' Miss Carroll pulled up and called emergency services before getting out of her car. 'I saw some people standing on the . canal bank. There was the car and then I saw somebody sat on top of the . car. He appeared to be kicking backwards at the car, shouting, 'Help me! Please help me!' 'A little bit after I got out of my car there appeared to be an older gentleman get out of the canal.' Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, asked . the witness: 'Did you see anything out of the ordinary during the time . you were in the vicinity and observing these events?' 'No,' Miss Carroll replied. 'Any brick or obstruction in the road at the time?' 'No,' she again replied. Elliot Fox lived in the Bridge . Apartments overlooking the canal and from his balcony could see the . BMW's lights on under the water. Mr Fox told the jury he dashed to the scene and saw Seddon in the water trying to break the windows of the car. The defendant then climbed up on top of the vehicle to kick back against the windows with his heels. Investigation: Prosecutors said the scene had been . made to look like a murder-suicide . 'At this point I had to shout for him to get off the car, as it was making it sink,' Mr Fox said. 'I repeated it and he got off the car.' Daniel Seddon had got out of the car . through the front passenger window and reached the far canal side, Mr . Seddon senior had managed to get out of one back window with the help of . his son, but Patricia Seddon was still in the car. 'The female passenger could not get . out of the windows. She wasn't moving, sitting completely still and . remained there until the car eventually became fully submerged,' Mr Fox . said. A fireman showed 'huge heroism', the . court heard, by jumping into the murky waters of the Bridgewater Canal . and swam with an axe to break the back window of the vehicle. 'He was saying, 'I have her hand!' through the back window. Two other firemen had to go in to assist. 'The car was submerged for one or two minutes but eventually she was pulled out of the car.' Later 'out of curiosity' he checked the scene for evidence of a brick but found none. Seddon denies two counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder. The trial was adjourned until Monday.

Callous: Beth Parr, 36, from Birkenhead conned a friend out of over £130,000 by claiming that she needed money for specialist cancer treatment . A cynical fraudster 'fleeced' a trusting and wealthy spinster out of almost £130,000 by telling her she had four different types of cancer, a court heard today. Beth Parr, 36, conned her friend Maureen Briscoe over a period of two and a half years by telling her she needed treatment for brain, lung, bone and eye cancer. Liverpool Crown Court heard that Parr also lied to her husband and 14-year-old daughter who also believed she was ill. But in fact Parr has never suffered from any form of cancer and was using the cash she conned out of her friend to spend on a 'luxury and extravagant' lifestyle beyond her means. The spending included trips abroad to destinations like Jamaica, 'a motor vehicle' and gadgets like tablet computers, the court heard. Sentencing her to two years and four months in prison Judge Dennis Watson QC said: 'Four different forms of cancer which were all deployed cynically in an attempt, to use the old-fashioned phrase, to fleece her. 'The wool on the back of the animal was shorn and fleeced with the skill of an accomplished fraudster.' Parr, of Yelverton Road, Birkenhead, bowed her head and wept quietly as the details and extent of her fraud were laid bare. Parr claimed she did not realise that Ms Briscoe had a phobia of cancer but Judge Watson said he 'did not accept for a minute' that Parr did not know that the victim was 'worried about cancer'. He said Ms Briscoe, 68, was a 'spinster' who had retired 'because she was suffering from an obsessive fear of cancer'. Liar: Parr wept in court as her lies of having cancer were laid bare . He added: 'You knew that she was on her own. You targeted her because of that. She had no family.' He said Parr was motivated by 'greed' and the fact that Ms Briscoe thought of the defendant as family showed there was 'a significant element of trust' that was placed in her which Parr 'deliberately and cynically took advantage of'. 'You told her over a period of two and a half years a series of callous lies,' the judge added.","Beth Parr told her friend Maureen Briscoe that she had four different types of cancer; brain, lung, bone and eye cancer .

A couple were banned from being alone with their baby and investigated by police when a mystery mark appeared on her foot. Kelly Cook, 31, and Ian Hutchison, 35, were accused of harming seven-week-old Ava by social workers. They endured ‘three weeks of hell’, petrified that their first child would be taken away. Hellish: Kelly Cook said she and partner Ian Hutchison went through 'three weeks of hell' when they were accused of hurting newborn Ava . Blemish: A health visitor found the unexplained mark on baby Ava's foot and called social services . Their torment eventually ended when a dermatologist ruled the reddish mark was not a bruise. While the investigations went on, the couple were not allowed to be alone with Ava and they moved in with Mr Hutchison’s parents to keep her in their care. Their ordeal began when a health visitor noticed the blemish during a regular check-up. She was convinced it was a bruise, which a baby so young could not have caused herself, and police, doctors and social services were drafted in. Within hours, the couple, of Shirley, Southampton, were under scrutiny at a hospital as paediatricians and a dermatologist examined Ava. Mystery: The worried parents had explained to doctors that the unexplained mark on Ava's foot would disappear and reappear . They could not rule out a birthmark, so Miss Cook, a legal secretary, and Mr Hutchison had to bring her back two days later. But a dermatologist was not available then and, as the  mark had faded, it was judged to be a bruise. Ava had to undergo numerous tests, . scans and X-rays as her parents desperately insisted that the mark kept . appearing  and fading. They even provided photo evidence but were told . Ava was subject to a Section 47 Child Protection Inquiry, meaning social . services believed she was at serious risk of harm. But, while staying with Mr Hutchison’s . parents, the family did not hear from social services for nine days. It . was not until a social worker visited on December 31 that the mark was . seen appearing and disappearing, proving it was not a bruise. Safe and sound: Ten minutes after a dermatologist confirmed that Ava had not been injured the case against her worried parents was closed . Under suspicion: Ms Cook and Mr Hutchison were told that they could only keep Ava with them if they stayed with his parents . A week later, an examination by a . dermatologist finally confirmed this. Less than ten minutes later, the . couple were told the case was closed and they could take Ava home. However, they said, there was no . apology or explanation and they have lodged a formal complaint at the . way Ava’s case was handled. The couple also want to know why she was not checked for so long if she was deemed to be at serious risk. ‘We endured three weeks of  hell when we should have been  happily bonding with our baby,’ said Miss Cook. ‘Had they listened to us and looked at . the photos I had taken of Ava’s foot, this could have all been cleared . up within two days. ‘Instead our first few weeks with Ava were ruined as we were petrified we might lose her. We’ll never get that time back. ‘We couldn’t go anywhere without Ian’s . parents and even my parents had to be police checked before we could go . to their house for a visit’ Ava will have a dermatology appointment to determine what the mark is. A Southampton council spokesman . declined to comment on individual cases but said it ‘follows a standard . procedure based on national guidelines’. Petrified: Kelly Cook said she would never get the time back which she had spent worried that she would lose Ava .","Parents Kelly Cook and Ian Hutchison feared losing baby Ava .

The Bank of England governor insisted yesterday that he knew nothing about the manipulation of crucial interest rates until just two weeks ago. During a grilling by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee, Sir Mervyn King said he was not aware of the ruthless rigging of rates – even though he was warned about it four years ago. The governor was sent an email by America’s Federal Reserve Bank in June 2008, which made a clear reference to ‘deliberate misreporting’ of Libor, the interbank lending rate. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Questions: Sir Mervyn King today insisted that the he only learned there had been fraud in interbank lending rates two weeks ago despite evidence the US authorities warned of potential fiddling back in 2008 . Asked how he could not have known . about the problem, Sir Mervyn, who retires next year, said ‘everyone’ was concerned about Libor. But he insisted: ‘That is a million . miles away from saying that is the same as a deliberate, deceitful . manipulation of [Libor] submissions in order to make financial gain. ‘There was no suggestion of fraudulent behaviour or wrongdoing or anything of the sort.’ Labour MP John Mann yesterday accused Sir Mervyn of being ‘in denial’ about the rigging of Libor rates. Sir Mervyn’s deputy Paul Tucker also . came under fire for failing to react to the note warning about . irregularities in the Libor rate, signed by Timothy Geithner, now the US . Treasury Secretary. Advance warning: The email from Timothy Geithner, then head of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, to Sir Mervyn King in 2008 in which suggestion to reform Libor were attached . The committee heard that Sir Mervyn, left, was warned about the Libor index being 'deliberately misreported' by the then president of the US Federal Reserve Tim Geithner, right, as long ago as 2008 . Michael Fallon, a Tory MP, asked . repeatedly how the words ‘deliberate misreporting’, in the first . paragraph of the Federal Reserve’s note, could not have triggered alarm. Mr Tucker, who had been the frontrunner to succeed Sir Mervyn next year, said: ‘I’m not sure I addressed my mind to it.’ Asked by Mr Fallon why the ‘penny did . not drop at the phrase “deliberate misreporting”’, he added: ‘It did not . set off dishonesty alarm bells.’ But he later admitted there had been . misreporting, adding: ‘It turns out that, with hindsight, yes, it was . but it did not set alarm bells ringing at the time, I’m afraid.’ Denial: The hearing of the Treasury committee (pictured) heard how Sir Mervyn told MPs that Barclays was in a 'state of denial' over regulatory concerns with the bank following its rate-rigging scandal . Labour MP Pat McFadden said the . evidence emerging was increasingly embarrassing for British authorities . when compared with their American counterparts. He said: ‘The US authorities all the . way along have been more worried, hungrier for the story and more active . in pursuing it than we have in the UK.’ But Sir Mervyn said: ‘Neither did the Federal Reserve nor anybody else send us any evidence of misreporting.’ The scandal began with a devastating . dossier, published by the Financial Services Authority last month, about . the ruthless tactics used by rogue traders at Barclays to fiddle Libor. Email: Former Barclays boss Bob Diamond wrote to Mr Tucker on his appointment as Deputy Bank of England governor saying 'I am really, really proud of you' The 44-page report reveals . extraordinary emails showing how traders promised to celebrate together . with champagne and cappuccinos if they managed to pull off the con. In one email, a trader at a different . bank wrote to ‘Trader G’ at Barclays: ‘Dude. I owe you big time! Come . over one day after work and I’m opening a bottle of Bollinger.’ The scandal, which is expected to . spread to at least another seven banks, has triggered the resignations . of the three most senior executives at Barclays and a £290million fine. Yesterday Sir Mervyn hinted that . British regulators had been hindered by light-touch regulation pioneered . under the former Labour government. He told MPs: ‘I remember very clearly . before 2007 to be a regulator...was to have no support from anybody. Dare I say it, even in Parliament. ‘The consensus was anything that the . regulator did was to impede the workings of our efficient and dynamic . financial services industry.’ Sir Mervyn also revealed his . involvement in the departure of Bob Diamond, the former chief executive . of Barclays, who resigned just six days after the FSA’s report came out. The Bank governor summoned the . Barclays chairman to a meeting at 6pm on Monday, July 2, and made clear . that Mr Diamond had lost the confidence of the regulators. He told MPs there were ‘genuine and deep’ concerns about Barclays. ‘It is possible to sail close to the . wind, once, twice or even three times but when it gets to four or five . times then you have to look at the captain on the bridge,’ Sir Mervyn . added. Scandal: The Libor rate-fixing scandal has already claimed the scalps of bank boss Bob Diamond and two other senior Barclays executives and Sir Mervyn said that the bank 'sailed close to the wind' Libor, short for London Interbank Offered Rate, is the average interest rate at which banks lend to each other. It is calculated from daily submissions by 16 leading global banks. Each bank sends details of the rate it pays to borrow money from other banks. The rate is an indicator of the financial health of a company. Just as countries such as Greece and Portugal can expect to pay more to borrow when their finances are in a poor state, a bank in a perilous position will have to pay a higher interest rate to persuade other financial firms to take the risk of lending to it. The Libor rate relies on banks being honest about the rate at which they borrow. This is now emerging as one of the reasons why it has been open to abuse. The rate reflects an estimated $550 trillion worth of loans and derivatives. It also has an impact on the rates of consumer borrowing, such as mortgages, student loans and credit cards. Libor rate submissions could therefor increase the interest rates at which the public borrow, potentially leading to higher profits for banks.","Deputy governor Paul Tucker said the warning from the US 'did not set alarm bells ringing'

New parents should carry their baby upright and facing outwards to improve the youngster’s development, a leading academic suggests. The technique allows a baby to observe the world as seen by his or her parents and could result in a more self-assured child. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jared  Diamond said Western parents could learn a great deal from child-rearing techniques used in more traditional societies, including tribes in the Amazon and Africa, who carry their babies around. Instead of keeping their baby in a pram, new parents should keep a baby at chest height and facing outwards to improve their development . Unlike a pram, keeping baby at chest height and facing outwards where it can interact with the world could leave them more ‘emotionally secure, self-confident, curious, and autonomous’. The 75-year-old author, a professor of geography at the University of California in Los Angeles, bases most of his observations on half a century of visits to tribal communities such as in New Guinea, where he lived among people who were still using stone tools. In his latest book, The World Until Yesterday, he argues that babies have the same instincts as our ancient forebears, and so respond better to traditional rather than modern conditions. Modern parents can achieve the carrying technique by using a papoose, which has  enjoyed a rise in popularity in recent years. Quickly comforting a crying baby, letting them sleep near their parents, and lots of physical contact are also beneficial, he says. ‘It is only relatively recently that some of these child-rearing practices became unfashionable. I suggest it’s time to consider some of them seriously again,’ he said. The professor, a father of two, added the methods have ‘in effect already been tested by natural experiments: different societies have been raising their children differently for a long time, and we can see the results’. His 1997 book, Guns, Germs, And Steel, which attempts to explain why history unfolded so differently on the world’s continents, won the Pulitzer Prize for non-fiction.","Author Jared Diamond said parents could learn a great deal from techniques used in the Amazon and Africa .

"By . Beth Stebner and Snejana Farberov . PUBLISHED: . 01:51 EST, 17 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:56 EST, 17 January 2013 . A California college professor who had been accused of setting multiple fires at his son's school over the summer to avenge the boy's suicide is now facing an addition felony arson charge. The Orange County District Attorney's has announced that prosecutors will file a new charge against Rainer Klaus Reinscheid Thursday. In July, Reinscheid, 49, pleaded to multiple counts of arson for allegedly setting nine separates fires to University High School in Irvine, a local park and a school administrator’s home. Legal woes: Rainer Klaus Reinscheid, pictured left on his faculty bio page and right, in his booking photo, will be charged with an additional arson on top of several previous counts . Loss: Claas Stubbe, pictured on a class trip to the Grand Canyon, hanged himself in March after getting in trouble at his high school . According to police, the man took the . drastic steps in a bid to retaliate for the death of his 14-year-old . son, who had committed suicide months earlier after being disciplined . for a minor theft. Several fires took place during the same period in the Irvine area, and police have continued to investigate the incidents since last July, District Attorney spokeswoman Farrah Emami told the Orange County Register. Reinscheid was previously charged in July and August with three felony counts of arson of forestland, two felony counts of arson of another's property, two felony counts of arson of a structure, one felony count of arson of an inhabited residence, one felony count of attempted arson and one misdemeanor count of resisting arrest. The 49-year-old University of California at Irvine professor of pharmacology has . been held without bail since the summer when investigators uncovered . emails written by Reinscheid laying out a plan to allegedly murder students and . officials at his late son's school. Reinscheld has never been formally charged in connection with the alleged murder plot. If convicted of the arson counts, he could face up to 24 years and four months in state prison. The . chain of events that landed the middle-aged educator behind bars was . set in motion last March, when his 14-year-old son, Claas Stubbe, ended . his life by hanging himself a day after being punished for a minor theft. The tragedy sent his father into a downward spiral that authorities said . led to setting fires and venting his anger in graphic emails describing . plans for a mass murder, sexual assaults and ultimately his own death. Reinscheid . allegedly wrote a chilling email in April titled, 'a good plan,' detailing violent revenge on the people he blamed for his teenage son's . suicide. Reinscheid . fantasized about buying a dozen machine guns, killing 200 University . High School students, raping a school counselor and killing the . assistant principal who disciplined his child. 'I will make him cry and beg, but I . will not give him a chance, just like he did to Claas,' Reinscheid . wrote. 'I will make him die, slowly, surely. Next I will set fire to Uni . High and try to burn down as much as I can, there should be nothing . left that gives them a reason to continue their miserable school.' Reinscheid never acted on his most . violent musings and police have no evidence he was preparing for a . shooting, but prosecutors charged him with a series of small arsons that . targeted the high school, the assistant principal's home and the park . where Claas hanged himself. Five fires erupted between July 1 and . July 19, and police caught Reinscheid as he tried to start a sixth one . July 24, Irvine police Lt. Julia Engen said. While investigating the fires, police . discovered three emails Reinscheid sent to his wife and himself in . April from his university account. Copies of the messages were filed in . court by prosecutors to have him held without bail. He's due in court . for arraignment August 8. In the emails, the distraught father . asks his wife to forgive him for many disappointments but asks her to . understand that he 'had to go this way' after detailing plans to kill . the vice principal and destroy the school in a firestorm. 'You would have done the same if it was your child that you failed,' he wrote to her April 26. Claas was Reinscheid's son from a . previous marriage. He has a stepdaughter and son from his second . marriage. He asked his wife to tell their son, 'Daddy was so sad when . Claas passed away, he was just eaten away by his sadness and stopped . breathing.' Set alight: Prosecutors alleged that the professor started several fires around University High School in Irvine, where his son went until his death in March . Crime and punishment: Reinscheid's son, Claas Stubbe, was forced to pick up trash after stealing from the school store; he later hanged himself . Two nights later, while on medication . to stay awake and 'legally drunk' while downing a second bottle of . wine, Reinscheid wrote to himself about how he had fantasized about . having sex with every young girl he saw on campus that day. Then he discussed his 'dreams' of . mass murder at the high school, including explicit details of how he . planned to make a teacher get naked in front of students and stab . herself with a red pencil before he shot her in the head. 'I will give myself a wonderful ending and be with Claas very soon,' he wrote. 'I like this plan, finally a good idea.' Reinscheid, a professor of . pharmaceutical sciences who also holds German citizenship, has not been . charged with anything related to the content of the emails because they . were private communications, said Farrah Emami, an Orange County . district attorney's spokeswoman. Bruce Blumberg, a pharmaceutical . colleague at UC Irvine, said Reinscheid was angry over the investigation . into his son's suicide and was considering legal action against the . school district. 'This is all a tragedy,' said . Blumberg. 'A boy is dead and he shouldn't be and his father is doing . allegedly crazy things that he shouldn't be doing. It's all a crazy . situation.' The son killed himself March 14 after . being ordered to pick up trash for stealing from the student store. After the suicide, rumors circulated around school that the teen had . been bullied, but police and the school district say they found no such . evidence. Gone too soon: His son hanged himself in Mason Park, pictured, in March; police did not find any drugs or alcohol in the teenager's system . Scene: In March, a maintenance worker found the boy's body in Mason Park, right; University High School can also be seen, bottom left . Ian Hanigan, a district spokesman, . said Reinscheid was angry with school administrators because they . informed the teen's stepsister of his death at the school, with no . family members present, after failing to reach anyone on her emergency . contact list. The school had no other complaints from Reinscheid after . his son's death and the professor hadn't threatened any school . administrators. Blumberg's wife, Dejoie, remains . close friends with Claas' mother, Doerte Stubbe. She said Claas seemed . affected by his parents' divorce and split time between Reinscheid and . his mother, who has multiple sclerosis. Tragic end: Claas Stubbe killed himself March 14 after being ordered to pick up trash for stealing from the student store . After the boy's death, Stubbe told her Reinscheid said he was writing 'goodbye letters' to everyone. 'At that point she said that she just . didn't care and I figured it was him grieving, venting and that sort of . thing. There was no threat,' Dejoie Blumberg said. 'I figured he was . very, very and extremely depressed - as any parent would be.' Longtime friend Olivier Civelli, . chairman of the pharmacology department, said Reinscheid was devastated . by his son's suicide but tried to keep it quiet at work. He showed no . signs of the deep anger evident in the emails. 'Rainer is not a violent person. Rainer never had a gun, I can tell you that,' said Civelli, who picked . up Reinscheid's car after his arrest last week. 'I think that maybe he . was doing that to vent his anger, he was telling (it) to someone who was . close - his wife.' That's an argument Reinscheid's defense would likely use if the case goes to trial - and perhaps an . argument that could keep the emails away from a jury entirely, said . Jacqueline Goodman, a criminal defense attorney. His attorney will likely argue that Reinscheid never intended to act on his writings, and was simply expressing his anguish. Knowledge is power: Reinscheid is an associate professor Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences . 'You have to take into account the . context in which these writings come. He's so emotionally distressed and . now he's under the commingled influence of psychotropic drugs and . alcohol and he's writing these things - not acting on them - just . writing them down,' Goodman said. 'He's clearly not in his right mind. It's like writing in a diary.' When police searched Reinscheid's . car, they found a red folder containing a newly signed will and also . discovered a power of attorney document on his computer that gave his . wife control over his finances and children, according to a police . report obtained by The Associated Press. Reinscheid has been at UC Irvine for . about a dozen years and rode his bike to work every day from his house . on campus. His research included studying molecular pharmacology and . psychiatric disorders, including studies of schizophrenia, stress, . emotional behavior and sleep, according to the school's website. He had requested a leave of absence from UCI, according to a police report. The college professor, who earned his . PhD in Hamburg, Germany, was arrested in the middle of the night on . July 24, after Orange County police allegedly caught him trying to start . fires in Mason Park Preserve – the same park where his son had hanged . himself in March. Prosecutors accused Reinscheid of . starting five fires at University High School earlier in July, allegedly . setting fire to various objects such as newspapers, books, fireplace . logs, and a plastic porch chair. He was released after his initial arrest on $50,000 bail, be was later taken into custody again following the discovery of the disturbing emails.","Rainer Klaus Reinscheid, 48, accused of setting five fires around University High School in Irvine, California .

Grey Poupon's famous 'Pardon Me' TV ad is making a comeback for a moment of Oscar glory. After a 16-year hiatus, the mustard that mocked its own stuffy image in one of TV's most notable commercials will once again take to the airwaves during the Oscars ceremony on February 24. The spot comes as Kraft Foods looks to boost sagging sales of the Dijon mustard, which is facing competition from a growing variety of high-end condiments on supermarket shelves. Scroll down for video . Comeback: The famous Grey Poupon 'Pardon Me' commercial is returning to TV - 32 years after the original ad, pictured, aired in 1981 . Classic: The interaction always came as the two Rolls Royces pulled up next to each other . The new ad begins in the same way as the original - an aristocratic British gentleman is being chauffeured in a Rolls Royce, when another one pulls up alongside them at a stop. The back window rolls down and a second man asks in an over-the-top snooty accent, 'Pardon me, would you have any Grey Poupon?' The first man courteously responds, 'but of course' and hands him a jar out the window. Other variations have followed, including one where the mustard-holder delivers the 'but of course' line before simply driving off, and another where the second aristocrat can't reach the jar. In the new version, however, the scene continues with the second car speeding off without returning the mustard, sparking a wild car chase through a golf course and city streets. Finer things club: The commercials appeal to those with a 'higher-end' image . New ads, same old mustard: Other versions include one where the man holding the mustard delivers the 'but of course' line before simply driving off, and another where the second man can't reach the jar, above . The ad comes complete with explosions to make the spot look like a trailer for an action movie. The ad was made by the agency Crispin Porter & Bogusky, which has also developed ads for Domino's, Burger King and Best Buy. It was directed by Bryan Buckley, who is known for making more than 40 Super Bowl commercials. Although the original Grey Poupon ad first aired in 1981, and others running through 1997, it's become so ingrained in pop culture that even teenagers today are familiar with its general spirit, said Sara Braun, who heads Grey Poupon, Miracle Whip and Mayo at Kraft Foods. Parodies of the classic commercial have been seen in Married With Children and the 1992 film Wayne's World. Parodies: Al Bundy, played by Ed O'Neill, spoofed the classic commercial on an episode of Married With Children . Party on: Elements of the commercial were also borrowed from the 1992 film Wayne's World, when the gang pulled up next to a Rolls Royce . Having a laugh: Mike Myers delivered the classic line in the film . The problem is that the familiarity hasn't been doing much for sales. Over the past four years, the company says Grey Poupon's sales have been flat to down as more mustards and other condiments have appeared on the shelves. Its share of the U.S. mustard market has fallen from 13.7 per cent in 2003 to 11.4 per cent last year, according to market researcher Euromonitor. Slipping sales: Grey Poupon's share of the U.S. mustard market has fallen from 13.7 per cent in 2003 to 11.4 per cent last year . So now Kraft is hoping to once again put the mustard in the spotlight. 'Grey Poupon is not as relevant as it was,' Ms Braun said. Kraft Foods Group Inc. plans to air the ad only once on TV, after which it will be available online. According to Kantar Media, a 30-second spot during the Oscars this year is estimated to cost $1.7million. But Kraft, based in Northfield, Illinois, is hoping the high-profile placement will help spark enough interest to engage people in online marketing campaigns. 'It's the classiest award show of the year, so it's very in line with the brand,' said Ms Braun, who noted that the marketing for the Dijon has always made fun of its own upper-crust image. Last year, for example, Kraft began an online campaign with a members-only Facebook page called 'The Society of Good Taste.' Fans had to apply and have their profiles screened to determine whether they met the club's standards. For example, people were given points for liking the opera and New York Times, or living in Chicago or New York and attending Ivy League schools. Points were taken away if people used poor grammar in their posts. Jokes aside, Ms Braun said there's a seed of truth to that higher-end image; Grey Poupon customers tend to be skewed toward household incomes of $70,000 or more.","Classic commercial first aired in 1981 .

Fire: The explosion sparked a massive blaze that engulfed an entire block and caused multiple injuries . Police Sgt. Tony Sanders said the manager of JJ's restaurant was unable to account for three people, but it was unclear whether they were caught in the blaze or had left earlier. 'The first thing we need to be concerned about is the people that are injured,' said Mayor Sly James, who also praised the work of first responders. James said officials were in contact with Missouri Gas Energy. The University of Kansas Hospital was treating six people injured in the blast, said spokesman Bob Hallinan. He said one person was in critical condition, two were in serious condition and two others were expected to be released. All of those injuries were traumatic, such as broken bones, rather than burns or smoke inhalation. The final patient there was a burn victim who was transferred from Truman Medical Center, Hallinan said. Dr. Marc Larsen, medical director of the emergency room at St. Luke's Hospital, which is near the scene of the fire, said they had treated eight people, six of whom were walk-ins with minor injuries.

There were signs that utility work was being done in area. A phone message left Tuesday seeking comment from Missouri Gas Energy was not immediately returned. Jim Ligon, a bartender who has worked at JJ's restaurant for five years, wasn't working Tuesday night but said he started getting texts and calls from co-workers minutes after the explosion. He said the incident happened during the peak of weekday happy hour, when there is typically anywhere from 15 to 45 people in the bar area as well as three to five tables of diners at the restaurant.

We're just really hoping we come out of here OK in terms of injuries.' Ligon said he was on his way Tuesday night to meet up with co-workers at another bar in town to talk about the incident. Video showed dozens of firefighters and other emergency responders battling a massive blaze that appeared to have engulfed an entire block, with flames burning through the roofs. Black smoke swirled in the air and debris littered surrounding streets. The shopping area was established in 1922 by J.C. Nichols.

Hearing: The Commons Public Accounts Committee, chaired by Margaret Hodge, will hold a one-day hearing into severance and pension payments made by the SFO at a one-day hearing . The Commons Public Accounts Committee is set to launch an investigation into severance deals worth more than £1million paid by the Serious Fraud Office. The watchdog will hold a one-day hearing into the payments next month after the National Audit Office (NAO) previously refused to approve the SFO's accounts. An 'irregular' pension and severance payment of £422,000 was made to Philippa Williamson, the SFO's former chief executive officer, last year. The Cabinet Office had not approved the payments made by the SFO - the independent body that investigates corruption. Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, has also asked that the NAO carries out a broader investigation into the payments, according to The Times. Two other SFO members of staff are also understood to have received large payments. Current SFO director David Green and former director Richard Alderman are expected to be called to give evidence at the hearing. Shadow Attorney-General Emily Thornberry told The Times: 'These payout deals have damaged not only . the SFO's already limited finances, but its reputation as well. 'It's clear that we still have not got to the bottom of what . has been going on.' Miss Thornberry also accused Attorney General Dominic Grieve of 'sitting on at least two reports . into alleged impropriety at the SFO', adding that she had 'dragged . such information as I have been able from a very tight-lipped . Attorney-General'. She also said that current SFO chief David Green had asked for an independent investigation but that its findings were not released.

Another payment of between £450,000 and £475,000 was paid the SFO's former chief operating officer Christian Bailes, which had been agreed by Mr Alderman.

Marriage counselor Sheila Loven told her client his marriage was over so he would have sex with her . After a former marriage counselor was convicted of sexual assault for having sex with one of her clients while she was treating him, another patient - a female - testified that she was also coerced into having sex with her. A jury found Sheila Loven, 47, from Texas, guilty on Monday for her behavior when she was  taking John and Brenda Holliday, from Arlington, for joint . therapy in 2009. During the sentencing stage of her trial, a 35-year-old woman said Loven asked her during therapy if she had ever kissed a girl before and said it would make her feel better if she did. Days after they kissed they had sex in a car together, something the witness said made her feel 'dirty' and 'wrong'. She had initially come to the counselor after she split from her husband. According to the Star Telegram, the woman told the court: 'Loven said it would make me feel better. Up to that . point I had never had a homosexual relationship. 'I tried to think it . through and it bothered me. I blamed myself. I thought it was me. It . made me feel really dirty.' Like Brenda Holliday testified last week, the woman said yesterday that Loven had become her best friend and that her therapist had described their meeting as 'God-like'. The 47-year-old's guilty verdict came after four days of testimony from the Hollidays which described how Loven drove them against each other, advised the wife to file for divorce and told the husband his marriage was over before seducing him. The couple reconciled after they compared notes and realized what Loven was doing. She faces a maximum of 20 years in prison and $10,000 fine. The female sexual assault victim also told the court yesterday that Loven asked her to hide her computer for her after she had falsified liability documents. She refused. She did, however, submit false insurance . claims on her behalf, which she has been granted immunity from in . exchange for the testimony against the former therapist. Trial: Loven in court yesterday when she was found guilty of sexual assault. She will be sentenced this week . Another woman, Stephanie Carroll, testified that she was having problems with alcohol, which is why she went to Loven. She said that after her counseling ended Loven invited her to a bar and encouraged her to drink. 'Not even a friend would do that,' she testified, adding that Loven got so drunk they were asked to leave the bar. Another former patient testified that she grew tired of Loven's drug and alcohol abuse and said she would often smoke marijuana and snort cocaine. What upset her the most was that she often did this in front of her youngest daughter. According to the Star Telegram, Loven told the woman's husband to buy marijuana and get her to smoke it because it would make her feel better. She said in court yesterday: 'I had to . get away from it. So I moved out of state. I found a wonderful . counselor who has helped me deal with this.' The woman said she has been diagnosed . with post-traumatic stress and bipolar disorders and has been . hospitalized for those conditions more than 20 times. A tearful Brenda Holliday took the stand last week and testified about her relationship with Loven, which she described as 'visiting my best friend once a week to talk' Sheila Loven counseled a couple in 2009 and allegedly used her counseling influence to encourage the wife to file for divorce, then had an affair with her husband, according to prosecutors . Another former patient, Sharon Creekmore, said that . Loven hurt her relationship with her eldest daughter, after she brought . to her in an attempt to improve her anxiety issues, according to NBC. She said Loven rushed her daughter . back into enrollment at college and that something happened over a period of two . weeks that her daughter has never spoken about. 'I . believe Sheila Loven harmed my relationship with my daughter,' Creekmore . testified. 'My daughter is now distraught to the point of being almost . delusional.' 'It wasn't marriage counseling, it was divorce counseling,' Mrs Holliday said in court. Tarrant County prosecutors charged . Loven, 47, with sexual assault, accusing her of breaking state law by . using her influence as a counselor to coerce the husband into having sex . in summer 2009. Threatening and profane text messages sent from Loven were also read out during the trial. After . the Hollidays reconciled, Loven is said to have sent them a number of . cruel texts until they went to police and reported her for harassment. One text message read: 'When are you going to figure out you are nothing without me. I made you into a man.' A message to the man's wife read: 'And then he talks about your body so bad while he's touching every inch of mine.' 'I hope you enjoyed your lunch. Didn't see me did you?' another text said. Wife . Brenda Holliday tearfully testified to the court last week that Loven . became like a best friend to her and she believed she had found the . perfect counselor, describing their visits like 'going to talk to my . best friend once a week'. 'There was nothing I did not tell her,' the wife testified. I thought . that she genuinely cared about me and I told her how lucky I was to have . found her. 'She told me it was a God thing. She would always give me a . big hug before I left.' Mrs Holliday also revealed Loven told her that her husband was a 'narcissist' and had stopped coming to sessions and following her directions to save the marriage. All the while she was allegedly having an affair with him. Loven's . attorney said it was a legitimate relationship which blossomed from . romance and there is no evidence of emotional coercion. Adam Burny said: 'It had all the . elements of any other romantic relationship. They went out to nightclubs . and dinner, and they spent almost every night together. What you will . not see in this case is any evidence of manipulation.' But the prosecution argued there was . manipulation from the beginning - when she started to see them . separately to 'collect their secrets' and then using these secrets to . drive a wedge between them. Loven advised the wife to get a divorce and then asked the husband on a date. Days later, the pair began having sex. She . stopped office sessions with the husband but continued to have sex with . him, while continuing to counsel his wife, prosecutor Betty Arvin said. 'She was the ultimate inside trader,' Arvin said. 'She got information about their lives that they had never . shared with anyone and she used it, she twisted it for her own sick . reasons.'

Tragic: Connar Kiedyk died after he was hanged by a dressing gown cord while playing Cowboys and Indians in his bedroom, an inquest has heard . A nine-year-old boy died after he strangled himself on a dressing gown cord while playing Cowboys and Indians in his bedroom. Connar Kiedyk was found hanged from his bunk bed by his sister in June last year. He had been excited when the Olympic torch had visited his primary school earlier the same day. An inquest at Cleethorpes Town Hall, Lincolnshire, heard how Connar's sister had been sent upstairs to ask her brother to sign a form as part of a change to his family's doctors surgery when she found him hanged. She ran downstairs and told her mother Ursula Kiedyk that Connar might have 'done something very stupid.' Mrs Kiedyk ran upstairs to Connar's room in Grimsby, called an ambulance and attempted to revive her son. Connar, who had been adopted by Mrs Kiedyk and her husband Anthony in 2009, died shortly afterwards at the nearby Diana Princess of Wales Hospital. The inquest heard how Connar had been upstairs playing his favourite Cowboys and Indians game using his toy soldiers when he became caught on his bunk bed. Mrs Kiedyk told the coroner that Connar had a bunk bed in his room with no bottom bunk in it so that he had more space to play and that she had asked him to tidy his room that evening. She said: 'Connar would usually shove everything in a corner and say it's done, and then said ""I'll go check"" which meant it wasn't tidy. 'Certain toys had to be downstairs in order for us to keep an eye on him with them, but we had no problems with his toy soldiers in his bedroom which he used to play Cowboys and Indians with.' The coroner dismissed any link between the incident and concerns that Connar was being bullied by classmates about his upcoming birthday party. 'He was a very caring young boy and took matters into his . own hands to help others.' Tina Burns, Connar Kiedyk's learning mentor . Connar had reported to staff at the Wellholme Community Primary School that his peers had said it would be 'rubbish'. Staff at the 550 pupil school described him as an 'endearing and bouncy' boy. Tina Burns, a learning mentor at the school, said: 'He was a very caring young boy and took matters into his own hands to help others. 'He enjoyed the extra attention and had been on a long and successful journey until he died.' Another teacher added: 'If Connar was being bullied, it was my responsibility to take care of it, and I saw no evidence of it. 'He was an irrepressible but very bright young man.' District Coroner Paul Kelly recorded an accidental death verdict. He said: 'Connar was a warm little chap and a much loved child. 'There were no adverse matters or third party involvement in Connar's death. Hearing: An inquest at Cleethorpes Town Hall, pictured, recorded a verdict of accidental death . 'Connar was playing Cowboys and Indians at the time, and it was an experiment involving his dressing gown which cost him his life.' Mrs Kiedyk paid tribute to her 'lively and bubbly' little boy after the hearing. She said: 'He was impulsive, and had no fear - except for spiders when he cried like a little girl. 'He had been really excited about his upcoming birthday party just a few weeks after his death and he was really excited about seeing the Olympic torch on the day he died. 'He told me on the off chance that someone had been picking on him about his party, but after that he got on with his usual routine of playing upstairs. 'He loved school and although he got into mischief himself, he never wanted to cause any intentional harm. He once told me he had 32 best friends. 'He understood dangers, but he was always willing to try things in practice.'","Connar Kiedyk was found hanged in his room in Grimsby, Lincolnshire .

DIY chain B&Q has been fined £20,000 after a bathroom display containing a ceramic sink fell on a four-year-old girl. The girl was with her parents and younger sister at the chain's store in Oldham, Greater Manchester, when she pulled a worktop with a fixed wash basin down on top of her. She suffered crush injuries and was treated in hospital for cuts and bruises. Although she was discharged that same the day the unnamed girl had to return for further treatment when she became lethargic and it was noted her ribs were bruised and face swollen. She has since made a full recovery. Fined: A four-year-old girl was injured when she pulled a kitchen display on top of her while shopping with her family at the B&Q store in Oldham, Greater Manchester (pictured) The incident in June 2011 was said to have been 'an accident waiting to happen.' An investigation by health and safety officers found that workmen subcontracted by the retailer had not fixed the display to the wall properly. And despite the chain's head office sending a warning round to all 359 of its stores about the incident, officials from Oldham Council paid a follow up visit to the store less than a year later and found that nine more items of furniture had not been properly fixed to the walls. B&Q pleaded guilty to contravening health and safety laws and was fined £15,000 and ordered to pay £5,497 in costs at Oldham magistrates Court. The incident happened in June 2011, when the mother of the child was talking with a B&Q sales assistant. The inquiry found that although the sink had been sealed into the work top with silicone the worktop itself had not been secured to the wall with the correct fittings allowing the girl to slide it on top of herself. Ruth Crimmins, prosecuting, said: 'This was an accident waiting to happen. It just took a four year old girl to pull it away from the wall and on top of her. 'This incident happened six months after the worktop was put into place so not only was it not checked for safety when it was originally installed it hadn't been checked in the six months after. 'Accident waiting to happen': The young girl was able to pull a bathroom display down on top of her at B&Q (file picture) 'B&Q has strict health and safety policies that just weren't implemented at a local level. Staff at the Oldham store failed to implement the systems put in place.' B&Q said it had since tightened procedures on safety. Lawyer Jon Cooper, who was representing the retailer in court, said: 'This was not a systemic failure - it was a failure at local level. B&Q regrets the injuries suffered by the girl and we apologise to her. Customer safety is of paramount importance.' Passing sentence District Judge James Prowse said: 'The girl's injuries could have been a lot worse. This was a serious failing with the potential for causing much more serious harm.' After the verdict Oldham Councillor Jean Stretton said: 'It is the duty of businesses to protect the health and safety of all customers who visit their premises. If they break the law then we will prosecute.'","The girl suffered crush injuries at the store in Oldham, Greater Manchester .

Well-known for its Grand Pier, promenade and beaches, the seaside resort of Weston-super-Mare has emerged as an unlikely capital for unhappily married couples. Some 2,447 divorce petitions were lodged in the coastal town of just 80,000 people last year - the second highest level of any city or town outside London - a total of 7.5 per cent of all adults. Birmingham topped the list with 2,799 couples applying for divorce in the year to October, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said, but by contrast it has a population of 1.1 million, more than twelve times as many people. Heartbreak hotel: The picturesque holiday town has an astonishingly high rate of divorce for a town of its size . Leicester County Court came third on the list of divorce applications with 1,831 petitions, followed by Romford County Court with 1,783 and Coventry Combined Court Centre with 1,766. The MoJ released the figures as it urged separating couples to use publicly-funded third-party mediators in a bid to avoid traumatic courtroom battles. It would not comment on why the town has such high divorce rates. Based on the latest information, there are 65,170 people over 16 , which means that a total of 7.5% of the entire adult population was embroiled in the breakdown of their marriage. Synonymous with images of donkey-rides, kiss-me-quick hats and helter-skelters, Weston boomed in the late 19th century into one of Victorian England's most popular resorts, but by the late 1960s was struggling to compete with overseas destinations. Separation: The town of 80,000 saw 2,447 divorce petitions lodged at its county court last year . The Somerset town hit headlines in 2008 when its Grand Pier burnt down, leading to a multi-million pound redevelopment which attracted 52,000 visitors when it reopened. The wettest summer on record last year reportedly saw trade for some hotel and restaurant owners fall by up to 60%, piling pressure on the town's tourism industry. The MoJ expects to spend £25million on mediation services this year, while it has changed the law so couples seeking a court order over child contact or a financial matter must attend a mediation assessment session first. Family justice minister Lord McNally said: 'All too often I hear stories of families going through expensive and traumatic court hearings but we know that when working out how to split assets and arrange time with the children, mediation is a far simpler and cheaper approach for everyone and leads to better outcomes.' Mediation services involve the use of an independent and qualified third-party to help couples divide their assets or arrange child contact without going to court.","Town of 80,000 has incredible amount of divorce applications .

Traumatic: Pam Bailey, of Fareham, Hampshire, was taken to A&E in an ambulance while suffering from a water infection, vomiting and dehydration . A 90-year-old dementia sufferer was left waiting on a trolley in a hospital corridor for a shocking five hours, it was alleged today. Pam Bailey was taken to A&E in an ambulance while suffering from a water infection, vomiting and dehydration and paramedics were said to have handed her to staff at 6:20pm at Queen Alexandra Hospital, in Portsmouth, Hampshire. They allegedly put the widow of more than 30 years on a trolley bed in a packed corridor for five hours until she was seen by a doctor in a treatment room, confused and distressed. She then allegedly had to wait until another four hours to be taken to a ward. An investigation has been launched by the hospital into the incident. Mrs Bailey, a former Women's Royal Naval Servicewoman, said she had been left shaken by her ordeal. She was surrounded by another 25 patients waiting on trolleys, her family claimed. Mrs Bailey, who still lives independently in Fareham, Hampshire, said: ‘I'm pretty shook up - it feels like the wait has cut years off my life. I think the hospital owes us something, but I don't know what it is exactly. A simple “sorry” would be a nice word for them to say to everybody. ‘For two-and-a-half years during the Second World War I was in the Wrens and we never had treatment like that. I wouldn't want anyone else to go through what I had to that night.’ The nonagenarian, who was diagnosed with mild dementia a year ago, was 'periodically monitored' and put on a drip almost four hours after arriving. Mrs Bailey's daughter Pauline Taylor, 64, sat with her during the long wait and said doctors told her to complain because it happens ‘all the time’. Support: Pam Bailey, 90, is pictured with her two daughters Jane Elliott (centre) and Pauline Taylor (right) Retired Mrs Taylor took photos of her in the queue and filed a complaint about the wait and her mother’s subsequent treatment. She said that although she and her husband were with her, Mrs Bailey had been left upset and bewildered by the experience. Difficult time: Mrs Bailey, a former Women's Royal Naval Servicewoman, said she had been left shaken by her ordeal . Mrs Taylor, of Gosport, Hampshire, said: ‘Mum was really dehydrated and in a bad way, so the doctor said we needed to get her to hospital. ‘The ambulance driver did say to me as we got into the ambulance that there was a queue at the hospital but I didn't know what she meant. ‘When she said that, I never thought of queuing on trolleys and certainly not for so long. Although the nurses took her temperature and blood pressure when we arrived, we were then left in the corridor. ‘It was a nightmare - I couldn't believe it. Because my mother has dementia and is elderly she didn't know where she was or what was happening. ‘The nurses, doctor and consultant were saying sorry, please put in a complaint, it happens a lot and it's not good enough. When we visited her the next day she thought we'd left her altogether - it was awful. ‘She was so cross and angry. Elderly people shouldn't be sitting in a busy corridor, there should be somewhere else for them to go. Mum is back home now but she's upset and will not go out. ‘This experience has really disturbed her and been an eye-opener for us.’ During her two night stay, Mrs Bailey was allegedly moved to two different wards. A Queen Alexandra Hospital spokesman said it is investigating but could not comment due to patient confidentiality. 'For two-and-a-half years during the Second World War I was in the Wrens (Women's Royal Naval Service) and we never had treatment like that. I wouldn't want anyone else to go through what I had to that night' Pam Bailey, 90 . The hospital aims to treat patients in . time according to their clinical needs, she said, adding: ‘We have . recently experienced an unprecedented increase in attendances to the . department.’ The hospital must see 95 per cent of patients within four hours. But it failed to do so between September and December, according to papers from Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust Board. On average, three out of every 14 people attending A&E at 6pm - a similar time to Mrs Bailey's admission - had to wait for more than four hours in November. In comparison, it takes six minutes from admission to triage at nearby Southampton General Hospital.","Pam Bailey taken to A&E while suffering from water infection and vomiting .

Red squirrels could make a comeback in the English countryside thanks to the pine marten, which preys on their grey cousins. The hard-up animals are much faster than grey squirrels, allowing the ferret-like pine martens to feast on them more easily. Since the introduction of grey squirrels from America in the 19th century, huge numbers of reds have been wiped out across England due to competition. Hunter: A study by the University of Galway found that rising numbers of pine martens led to a decrease in grey squirrels, allowing red squirrels to flourish . There are currently between 120,000 and 140,000 red squirrels in the UK compared to over four million grey squirrels. But a study in Ireland found that rising numbers of pine martens has led to a decrease in grey squirrel numbers, once again allowing reds to thrive. Since receiving protection under the Irish Wildlife Act in 1976, the country's pine marten population has grown, but the animal is uncommon in England. Experts say that if the little-known creature is introduced it could lead to a swell in red squirrel numbers on these shores. The study by the University of Galway found that red squirrels were spotted in areas where pine martens flourish. Researchers studied pine marten faeces which showed the animals regularly . ate grey squirrels but hardly any reds. Competition: Since the introduction of grey squirrels from America in the 19th century, huge numbers of reds have been wiped out across England due to competition . Reintroduction: Experts say introducing the pine marten, which hunts grey squirrels more easily, could lead to a rise in the red squirrel population . This is because reds spend most of their time in trees and are smaller and more agile than their relatives. The latest figures suggest there are as few as 120 pine martens, who also eat field voles, small birds, wood mice and frogs, left in England and Wales. Scotland has around 3,500, having been granted protection in 1987, and is also home to about 75 per cent of the UK red squirrel population. Agile: Red squirrels spend most of their time in trees and are smaller and more agile than their grey relatives . Belonging to the mustelid family, which also includes minks, otters, badgers, wolverines and weasels, the pine marten is about the size of a domestic cat. Dr Colin Lawton, lecturer in zoology at the University of Galway, said: 'The reason reds have disappeared throughout Great Britain and Ireland is because of the competition from the greys. 'But what we have seen here is when there are higher numbers of pine martens in an area the number of greys go down, as pine marten eat the greys. 'Reds and pine martens have lived together for thousands of years and have existed together quite happily. 'A possible conservation tool could be to introduce more pine martens to return the reds (in England) to their former glory.' Janet Wickens, director of the Red Squirrel Survival Trust, welcomed the results, saying: 'To have a natural predator for greys would really help but there would be an awful lot of people not happy with the introduction of pine martens into the countryside.' Lizzie Croose, project support officer at The Vincent Wildlife Trust, which studies pine martens, said: 'It's great that pine martens are recovering and if their recovery has a positive impact on the red squirrel that is really good news. 'Pine martens are native to all of Britain and in areas where they are absent their absence has an effect on that eco-system - there is less pressure on the grey squirrels, they flourish and make life harder for the red squirrel.'","The predators can hunt grey squirrels more easily facilitating red cousins .

Unconscious and bleeding: Anthony Owen was found having sustained fatal head injuries yards from his home in Cheshire . The family of a cancer surgeon who died after being punched by a 16-year-old yob spoke last night of their shock that his killer will never face justice. An open verdict was recorded yesterday at an inquest into the death of Anthony Owen, 68, who was found sprawled outside his £750,000 home with fatal head injuries. But Cheshire coroner Nicholas Rheinberg said the evidence of the teenager who claimed he punched the regular churchgoer in self-defence after being shouted at was ‘evasive’. Mr Rheinberg added that there was ‘no substantial proof as to the means by which Mr Owen met his death’, but it was ‘totally out of character for Mr Owen to show anger, let alone strike out at someone’. The teenager had been charged with manslaughter but the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the case last year. Without any witnesses, lawyers said there was little prospect of a conviction. The Daily Mail can reveal that evidence from the boy’s headmaster, which was presented to the coroner but not made public, revealed that the boy ‘didn’t like being challenged by authority’. Now aged 17, and a student mechanic, he had only been at the school for around four months but was suspended at the time of the attack. Yesterday Mr Owen’s brother Eoaghan, 57, himself a retired surgeon from Horsham, West Sussex, said they had been left ‘disappointed’ by the justice system and would lodge complaints with the police and CPS for their handling of the case. ‘We were appalled, shocked and deeply saddened by the tragic circumstances of Anthony’s death,’ he said. ‘My brother has been let down by the justice system and that boy has effectively got away scot-free. We are disappointed nobody will face justice. Quiet village: The £750,000 house of Dr Anthony Owen, near where he was found lying on the ground . ‘The coroner has basically said he didn’t know how Anthony died, but we do know that if he hadn’t encountered that boy on that night Anthony would still be here today. The CPS said that because they had no witnesses to corroborate what the boy had said – my brother was dead, he was the silent witness – they had no chance of getting a conviction, but that effectively denied us justice. Mr Owen, who never married, was semi-retired but had been working as a locum at Wrexham Maelor Hospital in North Wales up until his death. ‘I do not object to anyone having a defence, but it is wrong that that defence has never been challenged or put to a jury. The CPS had the uncorroborated testimony of a thug against the conduct of a professional man who worked all his life caring for others. ‘Anthony was a pillar of society and a devout Roman Catholic who lived a blameless life. There is no evidence that my brother ever attacked anyone. It is totally inconsistent with his reputation. 'A jury should have been given the chance to decide what was the truth in court.’ Mr Owen’s sister, solicitor Alison Baverstock, 63, of Bournemouth, added: ‘We feel very let down.’ Warrington coroner’s court heard that the incident involving Anthony Owen and the teenager happened last March in the prosperous Cheshire village of Hale, near Widnes, where the surgeon had been picking up litter from the grass verge next to his thatched home. The boy, who was riding a BMX bike and . was with two friends, said he punched Mr Owen after the surgeon began . shouting at him for having no lights on his bike. Mr Owen was found on the ground next to his car and died in hospital six days later. The . boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was arrested but the CPS . dropped the charge of manslaughter after a pathologist’s report . supported his claim that he hit the cancer specialist in self-defence.

Foreign Office diplomats considered the possibility of allowing Argentina a naval base on the Falklands shortly before the 1982 invasion, newly declassified documents reveal. They show how David Joy, of the British Embassy in Buenos Aires, contacted his Chilean counterpart Raul Schmidt to discuss tensions with Argentina before filing a restricted memorandum on March 5 1982. Chile and Argentina had long been in dispute over the possession of Picton, Lennox and Nueva islands in the Beagle Channel at the southern tip of South America and had come to the brink of war in 1978. Enter the Argies: British diplomats considered discussing an Argentinian permission to operate a naval base from the Falklands just two weeks before the 1982 war (pictured is Port Stanley) According to the documents, Schmidt told Joy that Argentina’s sovereignty disputes with Chile and the UK both stemmed from the country’s desire to have a naval base further south. ‘The Schmidt thesis is based essentially on the Argentine Navy’s need of a strategic port further south than its current and most secure port, Puerto Belgrano, (south of the province of Buenos Aires),’ one document states. ‘The obvious option Ushuaia was not satisfactory from a security point of view because it is under constant Chilean surveillance. ‘Therefore the Argentines are, according to Schmidt, desperate to have some other secure port further south, a goal that could be satisfied by having access to the islands south of Beagle or the Falklands. In this context, he believes the sovereignty disputes are linked.’ On the verge: A mere two weeks after the British ambassador to Argentina corresponded with his Chilean counterpart regarding the naval base, war broke out . New base: In 1982, Argentina wanted a naval base further south and British Ambassador David Joy thought it an idea to bring a possible base on the Falklands to the table . On March 15 the report, headed ‘A Common Burden with Chile?’, was received and distributed to Colin Bright, manager of the South American section of the Foreign Office, and other senior officials. Handwritten notes were then added to the documents, suggesting the British were open to the idea of negotiating an agreement for an Argentine naval base on the Falklands just two weeks before the war began. One scribbled note states: ‘I think we are agreed that the Argentine interest in South Atlantic security is part of her wish to gain sovereignty over the islands. But it’s only a small part. After all, if all they wanted was a naval base we could easily accommodate them.’ Another in different handwriting comments: ‘Could we easily accommodate the Argentines on a naval base? Because this is the sort of idea which we should have in mind if negotiations do resume.’ Argentina long disputed rulings that the islands in the Beagle Channel were Chilean but finally recognised them as such in 1984 following papal mediation.","Declassified report reveal Britain considered Argentinian base on Falklands .

A battery that overheated on a Boeing 787 flight in Japan and forced the plane to make an emergency landing was incorrectly wired, an investigation has found. The All Nippon Airways (ANA) Dreamliner touched down in Takamatsu when the lithium ion battery sparked an on-board fire, prompting the worldwide grounding of the Boeing 787 jets due to safety concerns.

Prince Charles picturesque rural idyll is under siege after planning was approved for three sprawling housing estates on his doorstep. Planning permission has been granted for more than 500 new homes in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, with one development due to be built just one mile from his Highgrove House home. Angry locals who have fought the controversial plans have now written to the environmentalist royal in a last ditch attempt to stop developers from moving in. Residents in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, have written to Prince Charles in a bid to stop three housing estates being built - one of which is just a mile from Highgrove, pictured . Campaign group Stop Tetbury's Excessive Planning Schemes said Prince Charles is very involved in the town and they feel that the royal is their 'neighbour' Developers had fought and lost a bid for . planning permission for homes on a plot of land just one mile from his . estate for the last 25 years. Local councillors repeatedly rejected . plans for the site and another greenfield in Tetbury but this decision . has now been overturned by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles. Horrified locals who have been fighting . the greenfield plans - on an Area of Outstanding National Beauty - have . called the decision 'a devastating blow'. A third plot, on an old brownfield site, had already been approved by councillors and is supported by locals. This means builders will start . erecting 436 homes and 50 care apartments within weeks - boosting the . size of Tetbury, which currently has 2,500 homes, by 20 per cent. A spokeswoman from Stop Tetbury's . Excessive Planning Schemes (Steps) said: 'We feel that Prince Charles is . our neighbour. He is very involved in the town and has a shop here. 'He is going to be able to see these . houses on the site. Part of the site crowns a little and rises in the . centre so you will be able to see it for miles. 'We are a small market town of 2,500 houses, to give us 463 houses and apartments and a care home is a huge thing to do. Mayor of Tetbury Rob McCorkell said he is 'bitterly disappointed' at Eric Pickles's decision to grant planning permission for the housing estates on the doorstep of Prince Charles's Highgrove home . 'Our infrastructure is extremely . stretched already. We are not NIMBYs, we feel there is already a large . development on the brownfield site. 'It is out of scale with the size of the town. If someone doesn't do something they will build here.' The brownfield site, on a former factory to the north of the town, will see 174 homes along with a 60-bed care home and 50 care apartments built. A further 250 homes will be built at Highfield Farm, an open greenfield site, with 39 erected on a second field on Bath Road - less than a mile from Highgrove. In a letter to Prince Charles, sent . after Steps was informed of Mr Pickles' decision on February 14, the . residents said 'no one is listening to us'. They wrote: 'During the Inquiry into . the Highfield Farm application no notice was taken of our . representation, in the form of a residents signed letter, that these . particular fields have been used by locals for over 20 years for . recreation and dog walking.' Locals say the new housing estates will be visible from Prince Charles's 900 acres Highgrove House . Hannick Homes first applied to build on the Bath Road site in 1988 and repeated the request numerous times before submitting an application for 39 homes last March. This was refused by Cotswold District Council but Communities Secretary Eric Pickles overturned the decision this month. Radical changes to the planning system mean developers can apply for permission to build on greenfield sites. This applies when the local council cannot prove it has land supply for the next five years. Campaigners fear Mr Pickles overturning Cotswold District Council's rejection of plans on the greenfield sites will set a 'dangerous precedent' for other areas. The Steps spokeswoman added: 'If councils aren't said to have enough land supply then anybody can apply to build on greenfield land. 'This is regardless of whether there are brownfield sites available. Hundreds of new homes will be built at Highfield Farm in Tetbury - set two and a half miles from Highgrove . 'The council can reject the developers application but then it can be appealed and accepted by central government. It has left everything open.' Tetbury Mayor Rob McCorkell said: 'I am bitterly disappointed by this decision. 'I feel that in this case an inappropriate application of the appeal process and the provisions of the Localism Act has led to our community having inappropriate and unwanted development forced upon us. 'It is too early to say what is going to happen in the immediate future but I intend to push for close engagement with the district council and developers in order to minimise the community impact and maximise the community benefit.' Campaigners have six weeks to appeal Mr Pickles' decision at the High Court. A meeting will take place between Tetbury Town Council and Cotswold District Council later this week to decide whether an appeal will be lodged. A spokeswoman for Clarence House declined to comment on the situation.","Three developments have been granted planning permission in Tetbury .

Police in New York are pioneering a futuristic new crime-fighting system that lets them see surveillance camera images from anywhere in the city and creates an interactive data map revealing arrest figures, license plates and radiation levels  - all at the click of a button. The Microsoft software, called ‘the dashboard’, sends an alert to officers as soon as an emergency call is made and operates a giant video wall that allows cops to watch more than 3,000 cameras city-wide as crimes are unfolding. It has been in use for a year but could now be rolled out to other forces in a move that could make tens of millions of dollars for New York Police Department, which gets a 30 per cent cut of any sales. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Crime-fighting software: Microsoft has helped develop the technology, which provides officers with huge amounts of information, including security footage from cameras across the city . The Domain Awareness System instantly shows officers an interactive map of the . neighbourhood of where the initial call relates to, footage from nearby . security cameras, whether there are high radiation levels and whether . any other threats have been made against the city. Officers in America's biggest police department have been using the system, which gives access to the department's voluminous arrest records, telephone calls, more than 3,000 security cameras citywide, license plate readers and radiation detectors, for about a year. And the NYPD could make tens of millions of dollars under an unprecedented marketing deal that allows Microsoft to sell the system to other law enforcement agencies and civilian companies around the world. The city will get a 30 per cent cut. Surveillance: The system is able to give officers access to more than 3,000 security cameras citywide . It is currently used only in NYPD offices, mostly in the counterterrorism unit. Eventually, the system could supply crime-fighting information in real time to officers on laptops in their squad cars and on mobile devices while they walk the beat. Jessica Tisch, director of planning and policy for the counterterrorism unit, said: 'It works incredibly well.' In August, officers used the system during a deadly shooting outside the Empire State Building. Dozens of emergency telephone calls were coming in, and it initially looked like an attack staged by several gunmen. But officers mapped the information and pulled up cameras within 500 feet of the reported shots to determine there was only one shooter. At about 9am on Friday, August 24, disgruntled employee Jeffrey Johnson hid behind a car and then pulled out a .45-caliber pistol on his ex-boss Steven Ercolino and fired at his head. After Ercolino fell to the ground, Johnson stood over him and shot four more times, a witness told investigators. The incident sparked early-morning chaos and multiple other injuries near the Empire State Building. Johnson was scuppered in his plans to escape after a construction worker saw the killing, chased him down the street and alerted police, who shot the gunman dead. In the rush-hour ruckus, nine passersby were injured. Two people - the gunman and his former boss - were killed. Investigation: Police lean over a sheet covered body on Fifth Avenue as they investigate a multiple shooting outside the Empire State Building, on Friday, August 24 . Killer: Jeffrey Johnson, 59, who gunned down his former boss Steve Ercolino in Manhattan, New York . Analysts are cautious about the . potential profits, saying that largely depends on Microsoft's sales . efforts and whether any major competition arises. While there other . data-drilling products made by other companies, they say the NYPD's . involvement could set the dashboard apart. 'This is the kind of stuff you used to only see in movies,' analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group, a technology analysis firm, said. 'Getting it to work in a way that police departments can use in real time is huge.' The venture began in 2009 when the NYPD approached Microsoft about building software to help mine data for the Lower Manhattan Security Initiative, a network of private and public cameras and other tools monitored by the department's counter-terrorism bureau. Development cost the department between $30 million and $40 million, officials said. 'Usually, you purchase software that you try to work with, but we wanted this to be something that really worked well for us, so we set about creating it with them,' said Richard Daddario, the NYPD's deputy commissioner for counter-terrorism. Officers were involved throughout the process with the programmers, offering advice on what they need during an emergency. 'It was created by cops for cops,' Tisch said. 'We thought a lot about what information we want up close and personal, and what needs to be a click away. It's all baked in there.' Dave Mosher, a Microsoft vice . president in charge of program management, said the company started to . market the system in August and is looking at smaller municipalities, . law enforcement agencies and companies that handle major sporting . events. No firm timetable has been set on when the dashboard will be rolled out to the entire 34,000-offficer department.

My husband... gave his life to demonstrate that brave men will serve while the cowards in the military-industrial complex... loot our Treasury to build inferior equipment' Anna Haney . The Air Force released an Accident Investigation Board (AIB) report after a lengthy investigation which said that, while the pilot was likely to have suffered a 'sense similar to suffocation' before his death, he was still to blame for the crash because he was too distracted to properly fly the plane. The report suggested he may have been struggling to activate the manual emergency oxygen back-up system. After breaking her silence, Mrs Haney described how she told the Air Force official who informed her of the reports findings in 2011 he 'should be ashamed'.

F22: This picture taken from a memorial page set up on Facebook is thought to be of the Raptor involved in the crash . The pilot's family have always disputed the findings of the December 2011 report. Captain Haney's sister previously said the Air Force was more concerned with protecting its multi-billion dollar fleet of F22s than its pilots. 'To them, Jeff was just a number, it feels like sometimes. But those jets are worth a lot of money,' Jennifer Haney said last year. Brave: A photograph of the late Captain Jeff Haney at the helm of a fighter plane . In March 2012 the late pilot's wife filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Lockheed Martin, the F22's primary manufacturer, and other firms involved in its production, which alleged they knowingly supplied the Air Force with a dangerous aircraft. Neither the Air Force nor the Department of Defense were named in the action. ABC News said the suit was settled under undisclosed terms last August, shortly after the broadcaster made inquiries with Lockheed Martin and the Air Force about an internal memo flagging up a design flaw in the F22's oxygen system a decade before Captain Haney's death.","Captain Jeff Haney's F-22 Raptor crashed during a routine training mission .

A young British skier died when he smashed into a snow cannon after drinking four bottles of beer before taking to the slopes, an inquest heard. University graduate Thomas Lynch, a holiday rep who had also led tourists on a bar crawl the previous night, shouted 'Watch this!' as he set on a steep run moments before the tragedy. But the 22-year-old lost control while trying to execute a turn and ploughed into the snow-making machine at high speed. Thomas Lynch, who died in skiing tragedy in France after crashing into a snow cannon on the slopes of La Plagne in France. The night before he had led tourists on a bar crawl . The snow cannon on The Solaise ski run in the town of Val D'Isere (in background) where Mr Lynch was killed . He suffered massive internal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene in the popular French Alps resort of La Plagne, near Val d'Isere. Toxicology reports carried out in France showed Mr Lynch, a former grammar school pupil of Kirby Muxloe, Leicestershire, had a blood alcohol level of 99 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The legal driving limit is 80. Coroner Robert Chapman recorded a verdict of accidental death at the hearing in Loughborough. He said: 'Thomas had had something to drink which may have affected his ability to turn and control his skis at that time.' The hearing was told how Mr Lynch had drunk beer the night before his death while taking customers on a pub crawl as a representative of holiday firm Crystal Ski, part of the TUI travel group. Mr Chapman read from statements from colleagues of Mr Lynch's who said he had also drunk four bottles of beer the next morning during the minibus trip to La Plagne on March 20. Colleague Alex Bodoni said it was a day off and 16 representatives and their managers - including Mr Lynch who was a university graduate and on his first season as a representative - travelled for a day's skiing. Mr Lynch, a former grammar school pupil of Kirby Muxloe, Leicestershire, had been in France for five months at the time of his death . The group took to the slopes on a red (intermediate) run, and Mr Bodoni told how Mr Lynch, an accomplished skier, shouted 'Watch this!' before setting off very fast. But seconds later he collided with the cannon, on the edge of the run, in front of his horrified friends. They called in help and a doctor quickly arrived on the scene - but was unable to save Mr Lynch's life. Mr Lynch's father, Brendan Lynch, told the hearing he was disappointed the French police seemed to focus on the fact his son had been drinking before the accident rather than the siting of the snow cannon and how much protective padding it had. He said he planned to write to the authorities in France, adding: 'We want to make sure it doesn't happen twice.' After the hearing, Mr Lynch said: 'My wife Wendy and I feel privileged to have been Tom's mum and dad. 'He was our intelligent, kind, handsome son who loved life. 'Tom's passing leaves us with a hole in our lives which cannot be filled. We love Tom very much and will always hold him close within our hearts.' Mr Lynch studied economics at the University of York after achieving top marks in his A-levels at the £3,000 per term independent Dixie Grammar School in Market Bosworth, Leicestershire. He had been in France for five months at the time of his death, and worked the first half of the winter season in the resort of Meribel. Snow cannons are installed in many ski resorts. They produce artificial snow to supplement the natural snow in order to improve the reliability of a resort's snow cover and to extend the ski season.","Holiday rep Thomas Lynch lost control while trying to execute a turn .

A British inventor has made a 'tsunami survival' capsule, and is to test it by going over Niagara Falls. Aerospace engineer Julian Sharpe, 50, believes his disaster-proof pod will save people from tidal waves, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes and super storms. And he is so confident of the life-saving aluminium ball that he will ride it down the world-famous 167ft waterfall. Survival: Former Boeing engineer Julian Shape has designed a pod which will keep people safe during natural disasters including tsunamis and hurricanes . He said: 'We can tell people how strong it is, but until you've proved that it's saved a life they might not believe you.' Mr Sharpe claims the sphere will protect him from the massive impact, which will be similar to being rear ended by a car at about 20 mph. He believes the capsule will keep people safe in natural disasters, such as the tsunamis which hit Thailand and Japan. In a tsunami the main danger is not drowning in the fast flowing water but being crushed by the debris which is swept along. He said: 'Since it's a sphere, when you do run into something it's just going to glance off. 'In most cases, you're probably going to be a bit lighter than those objects so those objects will just go along their way and kind of move you.' Drop: Mr Sharpe is to prove how strong the pod is by going over Niagara Falls . Mr Sharpe was born in Carmarthern, West Wales, but now lives in Seattle in the United States. The former Boeing engineer has taken his prototypes to the Yokohama Expo in Kanagawa, Japan, and sponsors have commissioned further production. Now Mr Sharpe and his business partners are hoping to sell different models of the capsule for between £650 and £3,250 . Disaster: British search and rescue teams on the ground in Ofunato, Japan, where they were flown in to help search for survivors of the county's biggest earthquake and subsequent tsunami in 2011 . He claims the capsule will keep up to six people safe for several hours while it is buffeted by a Tsunami's powerful wave. He said: 'After the tsunami in Japan, we decided we had to develop it and get it out there for the masses. 'There are 135 countries worldwide exposed to the tsunami wave. 'If you can save one life, it would be worth producing it.'","Julian Sharpe invented pod to help people survive natural disasters .

A woman was dragged from a freezing lake by two police officers today after her car careered into the water in one of London's most exclusive residential areas. The female driver, 32, is believed to have plunged off a wooden jetty into the Long Pond in Totteridge, north London, just after 8am. A member of the public spotted the driver unconscious at the wheel of her blue Nissan Micra, which was already submerged halfway under water, and called emergency services. Submerged: A 32-year-old woman was rescued by two policemen after her Nissan Micra plunged into a freezing lake in Totteridge, North London, this morning . Crash: The woman's car is believed to have plunged off a wooden jetty into the icy cold lake . She was rescued by two officers from . Barnet Police after they waded into the freezing water and smashing the . driver's side window with a special police-issue hammer. The woman was showing signs of hypothermia and was taken to hospital. Her condition is not life-threatening. The two officers were taken to hospital after . for a check-up and tetanus shots, but were later discharged and sent . home to recover for the rest of the day. Barnet Borough Commander Adrian Usher said: 'I am incredibly proud of these officers and would like to pay tribute to the speed and courage with which they acted to protect the life of this driver. 'In the bitterly cold conditions we have today, there is little doubt that a sustained period in the water would have posed a serious threat to the woman's life. Rescue operation: Passers-by spotted the woman unconscious behind the wheel of the submerged car and called police. Officers can be seen paddling out to the abandoned vehicle to help retrieve it this afternoon . Dangerous: It is believed the woman may have spent up to 20 minutes in the freezing cold water - which may have caused her to pass out if she was not unconscious already . 'This incident demonstrates the lengths . that officers in Barnet, London, and across the country are willing to . go to in order to protect members of the communities they serve, and . they are deserving of our utmost gratitude.' The circumstances surrounding the incident are still unclear but the woman is thought to have spent around 15 to 20 minutes in the icy waters and may have passed out from the cold. The smash happened during the morning rush-hour, just off an idyllic road lined with multi-million pound mega-mansions, many of which are owned by premiership footballers. And today Inspector David Sanders hailed the bravery of the police officers who had rescued the woman - but remained tight-lipped when asked about possible reasons for the plunge. Brave: Two policemen waded out into the lake to reach the woman trapped in car . Pulling her in: The police officers used a special police-issue hammer to smash the car window and pull the woman out . He said: 'I would not . like to speculate at this stage.' 'The driver of the car was unconscious. The two calls we had from members of the public said she was unconscious. 'That could have been because of the cold - the two police officers had to smash the window open to pull her out of the car.' Inspector Sanders also declined to say whether the woman, who is a mother, was known to police. And Inspector Sanders lavished praise on the officers who had rescued her, saying: 'I am very proud of the two officers and I would like to commend their courage.' Saved: The driver - a 32-year-old mother - was showing signs of hypothermia and was taken to hospital. Her condition is not life threatening . The two young policemen were taken to hospital for a check-up but were later released and allowed to go home . He said: 'They were young, fit officers who took the decision to enter the water, which was very cold - at around 8am this morning the temperature was just above freezing with the wind-chill factor. 'They are unscathed. They have had a check-up, a shower, change of clothes and are now back home.' Inspector Sanders, who said he hoped the officers would be back at work tomorrow added: 'Officers obviously have guidelines to go by, and they are warned that their safety is paramount. 'These two took a decision that potentially saved a woman's life.' At lunchtime today the car was still submerged in around 4ft of frigid water. Policemen had paddled out to the car, while a recovery truck was parked by the side of the road waiting to tow the wrecked vehicle away. The Nissan Micra was hauled from the water in Totteridge to be towed away this afternoon - several hours after the crash at 8am .

But thankfully for five-year-old Jenson Lorey's parents, the panic was short lived when their son disappeared only to be found sleeping under a beanbag in their lounge. The schoolboy was at the centre of a huge manhunt involving a dozen police officers, sniffer dogs and a helicopter when he vanished. Despite bus drivers alerting one another over their radios to be on the look out for the missing boy, taxi drivers scouring the area and neighbours helping in the hunt, it was down to Jenson's six-year-old sister to find him. Told to stay at the family home while the grown-ups went off hunting for her little brother, she lifted the red beanbag and to the joy of their parents discovered Jenson curled up asleep on the floor. Here all along: Jenson Lorey, five, went missing and sparked a massive police hunt until he was found safe sleeping under a bean bag in his own home . His Mother, Samanatha, 28, said: 'I was out of my mind by then. We were fearing the worst. 'But my daughter moved our big bean bag and there he was - fast asleep underneath it. 'Jenson just looked peaceful but I was screaming with happiness. He was sleeping soundly when we found him under the big red bean bag in our living room. 'We were hugging him but he was completely unaware of what was going on.' Jenson's distraught parents Samantha and Andrew told how they called police when their little boy went missing from the family home in Penlan, Swansea. Relief: Jenson with his sister - and discoverer - Sienna, six, and his parents Sammy and Andrew at their home . Mrs Lorey, an office worker, said: 'I was at the gym with my friend and I came home to realised no-one had seen Jenson for 20 minutes. 'Andrew said he was in the kitchen and when he came out, Jenson was gone. 'I started screaming and running around the street - I thought the worst had happened.' The family praised the police for their swift response to the missing child alert. Andrew, 29, said: 'We had 12 police officers out looking for him, police dogs, and the helicopter. They searched the attic, they searched everywhere. 'Everyone who knew me was out looking but even people who didn't know me were looking too. 'The bus drivers were using their radios, and the taxi drivers were all looking. 'It was just incredible. The support we had was phenomenal.' Jenson disappeared from his home at around 8.15pm on Monday and wasn't found until 9.45pm. Sienna picked up the squashy red bean bag in their living room - but Jenson kept on snoozing. Sammy said: 'I just didn't want to let him go - I can't stop hugging him. 'He cannot have been under the bean bag all that time because it was moved several times. All we know is that was sleeping soundly when we found him.' Andrew said: 'Not even the sound of the sirens woke him up. It was the worst time you can imagine as a parent. 'I don't think he will go under that bean bag again.' Inspector Phil Thomas, of South Wales Police, led the manhunt for the missing child. He said: 'It just goes to show how strong the community spirit can be when faced with situations like this. 'We had a lot of resources and everybody in the area to help out.

A highly stylised shoe by one of the fashion world’s brightest new names will quite literally light up London Fashion Week as it launches today thanks to the university where he learned his trade. Shoe designer Liam Fahy, whose luxury ladies footwear label claims to make the most expensive shoes in the world, is creating a one-off design fitted with crystal lights to display at the prestigious fashion event. He will display his collection at LFW’s Somerset House from Friday 15 February to Tuesday 19 after winning one of the British Fashion Council’s NEWGEN awards. Light up: Liam Fahy is creating a one-off design fitted with crystal lights and will display his collection at LFW’s Somerset House . Since its inception, previous NEWGEN winners have included Alexander McQueen, Boudicca, Matthew Williamson, Julien Macdonald, and more recently, Christopher Kane, Marios Schwab, Richard Nicoll, Erdem, Mary Katrantzou and Meadham Kirchhoff. 'Every now and then we do a special project,' explained Liam. 'This one has dozens of flashing crystal lights on it and, due to its complexity, was partly assembled in our factory in Venice and partly with De Montfort University in Leicester, as it required microchips and a small team of highly specialist technicians who can’t be found anywhere else.' Liam graduated from De Montfort University in 2006 and his former Footwear course leader Kevin Guildford put him in contact with technical services manager Manbir Sambhi and digital design engineer Dilip Chauhan from the Faculty of Technology, plus computing lecturer Brian Bramer, who created the microchips and circuitry for the shoe. Th team: Liam graduated from De Montfort University in 2006 and his former Footwear course leader put him in contact with Manbir Sambhi and Dilip Chauhan to help create the design . Kevin said: 'They have had to make a custom-made circuit board to fit Liam’s design. The fact he’s making it here is really good news for us. 'We have a strong connection with Liam. He has also come in to speak to our students and he mentors some of our postgraduates who want to get into that field. 'When our students leave here we don’t forget about them. They feel connected to the course and are free to contact us for help. 'Of course, it also works the other way round – they give us things, such as materials and mentoring. 'On our course, people such as Liam get used to using all the different faculties in their designs and if they want to use wood, or plastics for example, they can turn to our colleagues in other departments.' Liam, whose shoes are made from exotic materials such as python, crocodile or lizard skin and Swarovski crystals, only launched his company about a year ago. 'It took more than a year to find a factory that had everything we needed. When it comes to footwear you have to have huge capital just to start up, to get all the right tooling, people and a good PR team, etc. New face: Liam, whose shoes are made from exotic materials such as python, crocodile or lizard skin and Swarovski crystals, only launched his company about a year ago . 'It’s great to have a highly respected institution like the BFC recognise and support our label. We’re really looking forward to showing the new collection.' Born in Zimbabwe, his African heritage often influences his styles. He lived for a while on a small snake farm and spent a year living with the Tonga Tribe in the remote valleys of the Zambezi River before enrolling at the renowned De Montfort University course.

Police have defended their decision to use Facebook to notify a mother that her 30-year-old son had died after being hit by a car. Frantic Anna Lamb-Creasey - who did not see the message from police until a month later - had spent weeks searching for her son Rickie Lamb, who went missing in Atlanta, U.S., in January. Now a detective from the Clayton County Police Department has said 'several traditional attempts' were made to contact Mr Lamb's family, adding: 'Society has accepted social media as a major form of communication, and so have I'. Scroll down for video . Devastation: Anna Lamb-Creasey was infuriated after police used Facebook to notify her of her 30-year-old son's death . Search: Rickie Lamb's mother had been calling hospitals for weeks after her son (pictured) went missing . The message to Mr Lamb's mother was sent from a Facebook account under the name of Misty Hancock, which had an image of rapper T.I. as the profile picture. Because it was not from one of Ms Lamb-Creasey's Facebook 'friends', it did not appear in her regular inbox, and when she eventually did see it weeks later, the strange name and profile picture led her to assume it was fake. As the family grew increasingly desperate, Ms Lamb-Creasey's daughter finally called the number listed on the strange message and was connected to an officer who delivered the news of Mr Lamb's death. 'We make every possible attempt to apply best practices when handling these sensitive matters,' the police statement said, according to Digitallife.today.com. The statement prepared by a Clayton County Detective said the force was introducing an official Facebook page to prevent similar incidents in the future. 'This site will serve as another format to relay current events and . notifications to the community that we serve,' it said. 'We . will continue the traditional methods of personal face to face contact . as we integrate this new tool of social media.' The force is also conducting a 'thorough review' of the way Rickie Lamb's family were notified of his death. Strange: The Facebook message about her son's death came from someone named 'Misty Hancock' whose profile picture featured Atlanta rapper T.I. Review: Clayton County Police Department said it was looking into why Misty Hancock's profile was used to deliver the message . Mr Lamb died after being hit by a car on . the night of January 24. His mother did not learn of his death until . February 14, when her daughter opened the message sent from Misty . Hancock on January 31. It read: 'Anna, This is Lt Schindler with the . Clayton County Police Dept.,' the message read. 'It is important that I . speak with you immediately. Call me at 678-***-****. Thanks so much.' Her daughter called the number and was connected to the police, who informed her that Rickie Lamb had died when a driver hit him as he crossed Tara Boulevard and Old Dixie Road on January 24 around 11 p.m., not far from his mother's home. Ms Lamb-Creasey said she was furious that her son's body had been sitting in a morgue for nearly a month while police failed to get in touch with her. 'They told me that they did the best that they can do,' Lamb-Creasey said at the time. 'But I'm not sure about that. (Because) if they can track a criminal down, they couldn't track me down? They could have done better. 'I've been on my job 13 years,' she said through tears. 'They could have found me.' Tragedy: Mr Lamb was killed when he was hit by a car on the night of January 24 not far from his mother's Atlanta home . Grief: Ms Lamb-Creasey said she was furious her son's body was left lying in a morgue for weeks . Anger: Mr Lamb's girlfriend also told of her anger at the police department's methods of contacting the family . Clayton County police said they made every effort to contact the family by phone. They said they called the home phones at several addresses and never could reach anyone. The force said it was looking into why Misty Hancock's Facebook account was used to relay the message. Griefstricken Ms Lamb-Creasey said getting in touch via an official police department Facebook page was the least officers could have done.

Top judges have expressed concern that criminal illegal immigrants could be blocking mental hospital beds because laws stop them being being deported or released into the community. The Appeal Court urged a 'speedy' review of the rules on mental patients who are not entitled to be in the UK after hearing from a top forensic psychiatrist that scarce beds that could be used by other patients are being needlessly occupied. Dr Mark Swinton told the court in London it has 'proved very difficult' to discharge patients like Imtiaz Ahmed following successful treatment, as they are not legally entitled to post-release support in the community. The Appeal Court was told it has 'proved very difficult' to discharge patients following successful treatment, as they are not legally entitled to post-release support in the community . The doctor made his comments as three of the country's most senior judges reconsidered the sentence handed to the killer who throttled his landlady, 21-year-old Jeanette Hullah, as her baby son sat nearby. In light of the problems he described, Dr Swinton urged the Appeal Court to make an order which would see Ahmed returned to prison - from where he could be deported - once his mental illness has been effectively treated. But, saying they could not allow flaws in the system to influence their decision, the judges ordered Ahmed's release to be decided on by medical professionals. Lord Justice Elias said: 'If Dr Swinton is right about this - and we have no reason to suppose he is not - it is indeed a most unhappy state of affairs and the authorities must look at it speedily. 'But we cannot allow it to play a part in deciding the proper disposal in this case.' The court heard Ahmed, now 25, was lodging with Ms Hullah and her partner at their home in Cheetham Hill, Manchester, when he killed her in front of her 15-month-old son in December 2006. Appeal Court judges fear criminal illegal immigrants could be blocking a mental hospital beds indefinitely . However, he was so ill that he was found unfit to enter a plea and it was not until July 2011 that he admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He was handed imprisonment for public protection - which is almost identical to a life sentence - and ordered to serve at least five years and three months behind bars, although that minimum term was later cut to three years and three months on appeal. The court heard medical experts were of the view he was suffering from schizophrenia at the time of the killing and therefore his responsibility was significantly diminished. By the time he was finally jailed in 2011, he had already served 15 months in custody on remand and three-and-a-half years in a secure hospital. The Appeal Court overturned Ahmed's indefinite jail term and replaced it with a hospital order so that his release date will be fixed by clinicians, subject to the Home Secretary's final decision, rather than the Parole Board. Lord Justice Elias said he accepted Dr Swinton's comments regarding the difficulties around his discharge, which could see him remain in a hospital bed and may be 'damaging to the appellant and to the wider public'. However, the judge refused to make an order which would see him returned to prison following his treatment. Sitting with Mr Justice Field and Judge Paul Batty QC, he added: 'We think that, in light of the circumstances, we do not feel it appropriate to impose a prison sentence as a form of punishment. 'Even less would it be appropriate to impose imprisonment for public protection, when it seems to us that, given the incident was caused by his mental disorder, there is no justification for detaining him once the medical authorities determine he can be released. 'This is a decision which, in our view, should be left to the medical authorities, rather than the Parole Board.'","Appeal Court urges review of rules on patients not entitled to be in UK .

Meat from British horses has been passed off as beefburgers served in schools and fast food outlets across the country, the Daily Mail can reveal. Many of the products, which were made by the award-winning Burger Manufacturing Company(BMC), in Builth Wells, Wales, have been eaten. The firm’s suspect burgers were on the menu in some 43 primary and secondary schools in Caerphilly, in Wales. Raided: Farmbox Meats processing plant taken from inside the estate where the horsemeat came from . BMC is also one of the biggest suppliers to independent fast food outlets in the country as well as producing gourmet burgers for restaurants, cafes and hotels. The company bought the meat from Farmbox Meats, which is also in Wales and was raided two weeks ago by the police and officials from the Food Standards Agency(FSA). It is understood the meat came from horses slaughtered by Peter Boddy, who operates an abattoir on a property near Todmorden, West Yorkshire. Mr Boddy and two people from Farmbox, including the owner Dafydd Raw-Rees, have been arrested and interviewed in connection with allegations of food fraud. Tests carried out by officials from Powys County Council found horsemeat in three burger samples taken from BMC’s factory in the last two weeks. Questioned: Owner Dafydd Raw -Reese (left) was arrested and questioned over allegations of food fraud; right, is his daughter Lisa, and business partner Colin Patterson . The level of horsemeat will be revealed, however it could be anything between 1per cent and 100per cent. BMC, which admits buying meat from Farmbox, describes itself as on a mission to ‘change the reputation and image of the humble burger’. It has a partnership with Sparks Catering Butchers, based in London, which supplies hundreds of fast food outlets, including kebab shops, in south east England and beyond. However, BMC, which also makes gourmet burgers, said:  ‘We also supply all conceivable types of café, restaurant, hotel and leisure outlet with a huge selection of steak burgers.’ The company claims to only use the finest cuts of UK and Irish Farm Assured beef, while its upmarket products include Aberdeen Angus burgers. Its website boasts of many accolades for its high standards and ethics, while it claims to have taken manufacturing burgers to ‘craft level’. The firm was given a silver award in ‘The True Taste of Wales’ for its distinctive and upmarket Kobe burger. Mislabeled: Frambox Meats provided The Burger Manufacturing Company with their meat and they were raided two weeks . It adds: ‘Every burger that our company produces has a distinctive taste profile that is consistent and unequalled within the burger manufacturing industry.’ The FSA said: ‘Three samples of beef burger products made by catering supplier, The Burger Manufacturing Company (BMC), have tested positive for at least one per cent horse meat. ‘Further work is being carried out to establish exactly how much horse meat these products contain and to test for the presence of the veterinary medicine phenylbutazone, or bute.’ 'Testing . carried out by Powys County Council, as requested by the FSA, has shown . that three samples of beef burger products made by catering supplier, . The Burger Manufacturing Company (BMC), have tested positive for at . least 1% horse meat,. 'Further . work is being carried out to establish exactly how much horse meat . these products contain and to test for the presence of the veterinary . medicine phenylbutazone, or bute. 'In line with good practice, BMC is withdrawing these products. The company is also contacting its customers to inform them of the . results of these tests and to withdraw any of the affected products that . they may have.' BMC states on its website that taste tests among children have found the firm’s burgers are extremely popular. The firm has a contract with the major catering firm, Holdsworth, to supply burgers to 43 primary and secondary schools in Caerphilly. Holdsworth said it was told about the problem of horsemeat contamination on Tuesday and ordered a recall of any burgers that have not been eaten. The firm said it had previously been given a written assurance by BMC that all its beef came from approved sources. Last week, schools in Lancashire withdrew cottage pies after traces of horsemeat were found, while councils in other areas have removed beef from menus as a precautionary measure. John Sparks, a director of BMC and its . London distributor, said it bought meat from Farmbox because it wanted . to support a local business. It . purchased a consignment of seven tonnes of meat from Farmbox, which was . thought to be beef, but appears to have been partly or entirely horse. Mr . Sparks said: ‘We bought the meat from Farmbox, it was labelled as beef. It would never have occurred to me to put anything in beefburgers other . than beef.’ He added: ‘We pride ourselves on using quality meat from, where possible, locally sourced suppliers. ‘Our . decision to use Farmbox Meats Ltd was to help boost local businesses, . and because of our belief in the quality of their meat.  It is . disappointing that on this occasion the high standards we expect have . not been met.’ The FSA will . reveal the latest tranche of test results on beef products for the . presence of horsemeat.

The horse doesn’t look happy and the portly new leader appears to be stuck in a tank hatch, but North Korea officials are obviously keen to show that anything Vladimir Putin can do, their man can do better. The secretive state has released a series of he-man images of Kim Jong Un, along with a video showing him driving the tank on a snow-covered road. The images were taken in 2009, and are strikingly similar to photos of the Russian leader in recent years, although Mr Putin tends to go topless. Men of action: New Korean leader Kim Jong Un (above) in a documentary screened there today in a pose similar to that taken by Russian prime minister Vladimir . Putin (pictured below) on holiday in 2007 . When Putin wants to show the Russian . public his mettle, he wastes no time in leaping aboard a stallion, . hunting big cats, or working out with special forces soldiers. Now North Korea's young new leader . has taken a leaf out of the Russian strongman's playbook, by . broadcasting footage of his own manful moves on state television. Kim Jong Un was recently named supreme . Army commander and has pledged to uphold his late father Kim Jong Il’s . ‘military first’ policy. The documentary, broadcast to viewers . in the world's only ever hereditary communist dictatorship, seemed to . show that Kim Jong Un was ready succeed his father, Kim Jong Il, who . died of a heart attack last month. The son, who is in his late 20s, has moved swiftly into the role of 'supreme leader' of the people, the ruling Workers' Party and the country's 1.2million-strong military. But there have been questions about how prepared the young Kim is to lead the country, with only a few years of grooming behind him. Military training: Neither men are strangers to combat, Putin, right, as a former agent in Soviet intelligence service the KGB and Kim Jong Un, left, as a graduate of North Korea's Kim Il Sung Military University . His father, in contrast, had been . through 20 years of training when his father, North Korea founder Kim Il . Sung, died of a heart attack in 1994. Sunday's . footage - shown on a day believed to be Kim Jong Un's birthday - . confirmed that he was being groomed as early as 2009 to succeed Kim Jong . Il. It shows him riding a galloping steed, . navigating a tank, observing fighter jets and firing exercises and . imperiously addressing troops. He . is shown seated in the tank's cockpit and speaking to officers with the . hatch cover open. He later drove it on a snow-covered road as his . father watched from a reviewing stand. The footage is reminiscent of photo . opportunities orchestrated by Putin who, in the past few years, has . posed for cameras hunting in Siberia, participating in judo . competitions, and making archaelogical discoveries while diving with . troops. The Russian PM, who is a former KGB agent, has also posed with biker gangs, in the cockpit of firefighting aircraft and on the race track, driving sports cars. New leader of North Korea Kim Jong Un inspects a tank in this undated still image taken from a documentary broadcast in the country today . Kim addresses troops in this still taken from the documentary, which said he was a military genius who had undergone intensive military training . For two years, North Koreans were told . that Kim Jong Un, who graduated from Kim Il Sung Military University, . was a military genius, Pyongyang residents have said. Today's . documentary said Kim Jong Un had undergone intensified military . training, and showed fighter jets tearing through the skies, and . soldiers jumping out of planes with parachutes and firing . multiple-rocket launchers. It cited Kim Jong Il as saying, 'Our general resembles me. ... I sometimes admire his strong belief, resolve and gut.' Kim . is also quoted as saying his son has 'outstanding strategies and is . well-versed in military tactics. ... He is a man of many abilities and . the genius among the geniuses.' Ominously, the younger Kim is also seen shaking hands with officials at a satellite control centre after scientists launched a missile test in April 2009 - and saying he was ready to declare war if the missile had been shot down. That test firing stoked regional tensions and earned North Korea international sanctions and condemnation. 'I had decided to wage a real war if the enemies shot down' the rocket, Kim Jong Un was quoted as saying. Military first: Kim Jong Un poses with soldiers of the Seoul Ryu Kyong Su 105 Guards Tank Division of the Korean People's Army . A voice-over described Kim Jong Il as . saying his son was in charge of the military's anti-rocket interception . operations at the time. North . Korea has said it successfully sent a satellite into orbit as part of a . peaceful bid to develop its space program. U.S. and South Korean . officials, however, said no satellite or other object reached orbit, and . accused the North of using the launch to test its long-range missile . technology. At the time, Japan had threatened to . shoot down any debris from the rocket if the launch went awry. U.S. lawmakers also urged their military to shoot the rocket down. Kim Jong Un's intentions as leader of North Korea are deemed crucial because the country is locked in a long-running standoff over its nuclear ambitions and is grappling with chronic food shortages. North Korea has tested two atomic devices and is believed to be working toward mounting a bomb on a missile capable of reaching the U.S. After years of acrimony, Pyongyang and Washington had begun discussions about food aid and how to restart nuclear disarmament talks that were suspended when Kim died last month. Mass mourning: An overhead view of North Koreans attending the memorial for the late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang last month . The U.S. and North Korea fought on opposite sides of the 1950-53 Korean War, and do not have formal diplomatic relations. Since Kim Jong Il's death on December 17, the process to install his son as leader has been quick, with top military and party officials wasting no time in pledging their loyalty to the third Kim to lead the nation of 24million since it was founded in 1948. Another documentary aired a week ago . showed Kim Jong Un visiting a premier tank division with strong . historical and family ties in the first solo inspection trip made after . his father's death. Kim Jong Un, who was recently named supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, has pledged to uphold Kim Jong Il's 'military first' policy. He is believed to have turned 28 or 29 on Sunday, though his exact birth date has not been confirmed by the government.

"By . Emily Allen . UPDATED: . 14:11 EST, 13 January 2012 . It is recognised the world over as a symbol of Britain's unity. But the design of the Union flag could be changed forever if Scotland wins its independence. The iconic red, white and blue design incorporates the crosses of the patron saints of England, Scotland and Ireland. But without the striking blue of Scotland's St Andrew's saltire, just the red cross of St George and the diagonal red cross of St Patrick, which represents Ireland, would remain. The patron saint of Wales, St David, is not represented in the Union flag as it is integrated into the constitutional body of England and Wales. The flag has been virtually unchanged for 400 years and is one of the more visual impacts the Scots and Britain would have to confront if the radical division went ahead. New design: This is what the Union flag would look like without the striking blue representing Scotland if it won its independence . National symbol: The Union flag is one of the best known flags in the world. It has been around for about 400 years and very little has changed in its design . Today, Education Secretary Michael Gove, the highest profile Scottish member of the UK Cabinet, accused SNP leader Alex Salmond of 'avoiding and dodging some fundamental questions' over the controversial issue. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'Do the people of Scotland want to have the pound, the euro or an alternative currency? 'Do the people of Scotland want to have the same level of welfare benefits as the rest of the United Kingdom? Talks: Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, left, is greeted by Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny at Dublin Castle today and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is also pictured shaking his hand. Mr Salmond has agreed to host talks with David Cameron and Mr Clegg on the referendum issue . 'Do they want to be part of the same nation that has a British Broadcasting Corporation and a National Health Service? 'Do they want the Royal Navy and British Army to remain institutions that embody patriotic feeling and sentiment, or do they want to sunder and separate them?' Scotland's St Andrew's Cross. The blue in the Union flag would be lost forever if Scotland decided to become independent . He urged the Scottish Government to accept a 'decisive yes or no question' for the ballot. Today Mr Salmond offered to host . talks with Prime Minister David Cameron and Nick Clegg 'in Edinburgh, in London or wherever' on . the next steps in the staging of a referendum. Mr Salmond's offer came as he met Deputy . Prime Minister Nick Clegg for a summit of the British-Irish Council in . Dublin, just hours after he accused the UK Government of 'bullying' the . people of Scotland over independence. Mr Clegg rejected the accusation of . bullying and said he and Mr Cameron had made it clear that they want . direct talks with the Scottish Government on the referendum. Mr Salmond appeared alongside Mr . Clegg at a press conference in Dublin at the conclusion of the . summit, which brings together representatives of . national and devolved governments from across the British Isles. The First Minister announced that he will . publish his proposals for an independence referendum in the autumn of . 2014 on January 25 and will be happy to meet Mr Cameron after that. Accusations: Education Secretary Michael Gove, left, the highest profile Scottish member of the UK Cabinet, accused SNP leader Alex Salmond, right, of 'avoiding and dodging some fundamental questions' over the issue . Should the Scots be allowed to keep the pound if they become independent? In . an interview broadcast shortly before the meeting, the First Minister . warned that he would not be pushed around by Westminster: 'Bullying and . hectoring the Scottish people from London ain't gonna work. 'What we're seeing is the most extraordinary attempt to bully and intimidate Scotland by Westminster politicians.' Asked about his comments, Mr Salmond . said: 'On the subject of Scotland's constitutional future, the UK . Government made proposals last Tuesday, the Scottish Government will be . launching our consultation document a week on Wednesday - a consultation . document with the whole community of Scotland. 'We believe, we know, . and I think it's generally acknowledged that we have got an . unanswerable political mandate - that is an absolute majority in a . proportional parliamentary system - to conduct a referendum on . Scotland's constitutional future. 'What I have said to the Deputy . Prime Minister, which I think is similar to what the Prime Minister said . in the House of Commons, is that, once we've published the Scottish . Government's consultation document, I am very happy to meet the Prime . Minister or the Deputy Prime Minister in Edinburgh, in London or . wherever to talk through these things in a positive way. The 'Union Jack' was first introduced under the proclamation of King James 1 in 1606 and was known as 'the British flag'. It was ordered to be flown at the masthead of all ships and warships of Scotland and England. The word 'Jack' was used to describe the maritime bow flag but by 1627 a small Union Jack was flown in this position. Some say it was known as the 'Jack Flag' or 'The Jack' for several years but by 1674 it was commonly called the Union Jack. Recently there has been some debate over whether the flag should be called the Union flag - unless it is flown from a warship and then it can be called the Union Jack. But according to the Flag Institute either is fine. It states: 'the national flag of the United Kingdom, the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories is the Union Flag, which may also be called the Union Jack . 'Far better, . whatever our views on events of recent days, that we can come to a . constructive dialogue. I think that's what the people would expect and I . think that can take us forward. 'Once we publish our proposals, . perhaps some of the fears that people have will dissolve in the light of . these proposals being published.' Mr Salmond wants to put the . referendum question - or questions - to the test  in a . ballot overseen by a Scottish body and open to voters as young as 16. Mr Cameron offered Holyrood the temporary power to hold a 'legal' referendum overseen by the Electoral Commission amid suggestions earlier this week that it would have to be held within 18 months. Yesterday, George Osborne twice refused to say whether the Scots would be able to keep sterling if they opt to break up the union. And the Chancellor warned that a move to back Mr Salmond’s bid for independence would seriously damage the Scottish economy. Mr . Osborne told ITV News: ‘Alex Salmond has said he’d want Scotland to . join the euro and you have to ask yourself is that the currency you want . to be joining at the moment?’ Asked whether the British government would let Scotland keep the pound, Mr Osborne said: ‘All these issues are going to be fleshed out now and flushed out.’ He added: ‘The SNP is going to have to explain what its plans are for the currency of Scotland, what its plans are for the defence of Scotland when it doesn’t have the protection of the UK, what its plans are for the Scottish economy when it’s not part of a larger economy.’ The Government in London has said that only it can sanction a legally binding referendum, which the SNP is planning for 2014. Warning: Chancellor George Osborne told Scotland it could be forced to give up the pound if it became independent of the rest of the UK. He is pictured earlier this week during a visit to the Macclesfield AstraZeneca site in Cheshire . If Scotland goes it alone, Mr Salmond would have to apply for membership of the EU and would be expected to join the euro. Mr . Salmond claims Scotland would walk away with 90 per cent of North Sea . oil assets, but leave English taxpayers to shoulder the £187billion . exposure to the Royal Bank of Scotland. Mr . Salmond said the people responsible for the meltdown at RBS ‘were the . London Treasury’, adding: ‘I’m afraid people will have to take . responsibility for the past mistakes they made.’ Labour former Chancellor Alistair Darling said Salmond publicly endorsed the deal by RBS that proved so disastrous . But . it later emerged he wrote a letter to disgraced former RBS boss Sir . Fred Goodwin offering him ‘any assistance my office can provide’ in the . purchase of ABN Ambro, the deal that wrecked the bank’s finances. Former . Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling joined the charge against Scotland’s . First Minister: ‘It is typical of his bluster. He cannot overlook the . fact that he publicly endorsed the deal by RBS that proved so . disastrous. ‘The disaster that overtook the bank was made in Edinburgh, not London.’ Mr Osborne warned that uncertainty over independence is already damaging the Scottish economy. He said: ‘There are businesses that are nervous about investing in Scotland when they don’t know about its constitutional future.’ The tensions over the referendum issue even spilled over into whether the Scots would be able to keep the two giant pandas loaned by China to Edinburgh Zoo. The Chinese have made it clear that the bears are ‘a gift to the people of the UK’. If Scotland becomes independent, some say Tian Tian and Yang Guang might have to leave the country.","Mr Gove says Scotland must think if it wants the pound, the NHS, same welfare benefits and to separate the British Army .

To add to Christie Jones’s distress, she had to fumble through her handbag for pain killers while she was in labour. ‘I could have had more support at home,’ she said yesterday as an investigation began into the affair of the mother who had to deliver her own baby at Sydney’s Blacktown Hospital. Ordeal: The pregnant woman was left to give birth on her own in the middle of the night despite screaming out for help (file picture not of woman involved) ‘I was left alone just to be in pain and deliver a baby myself,’ Miss Jones told Channel 9 news. ‘I was screaming out ""the baby’s coming!"" ‘Next thing you know she was born on the bed.’ The terrifying incident did not end there, for the baby girl was born face down in her fluid at 2.15am and a pregnant woman in a nearby bed had to come to the new mother’s aid and work at keeping the new-born child alive. ‘I heard her (Miss Jones) moaning and it become quite loud and it didn’ t sound right to me,’ said the pregnant patient, who wanted to be known only as Danielle. ‘The baby appeared in a breach position and in a facedown position on the bed.’ She said she then got the baby ‘breathing and crying’ and then she and Miss Jones claim they had to wait for five to 10 minutes before a nurse arrived. The ordeal for Miss Jones began on Tuesday when she arrived at Blacktown Hospital at 8.30am experiencing labour pain with her third child. She was taken to the birthing unit but several hours later staff asked her to leave because they said she was not ready to give birth. Miss Jones refused to go home and was then admitted to the maternity ward where a nurse reportedly told her to time her own contractions. Miss Jones said staff failed to regularly check on her progress and for the next 18 hours she was given just four Panadol and one endone tablet, including taking Panadol tablets from her handbag, for pain relief. The hospital’s director of nursing and midwifery, Mr David Simmonds, told Sydney’s Daily Telegraph that the incident would be thoroughly investigated, but he pointed out that the birth and maternity units had highly trained midwives and a full complement of staff at the time. ‘Birth can be unpredictable and can at times come on quite quickly. Staff provided regular monitoring of the patient and offered the best possible care in the time frame,’ he said. Labour Opposition Health spokesman Andrew McDonald has demanded answers from the NSW state government, saying it was completely unacceptable for a woman to have to give birth unattended ‘not to mention incredibly dangerous.’ Last night mother and baby were said to be healthy and ‘doing well’.","Christie Jones screamed 'the baby's coming' from her bed in Blacktown Hospital, New South Wales .

Sunbeds are twice as likely to cause skin cancer than a holiday in the Mediterranean, scientists warn. They say the risks posed to users - who mainly comprise young women - are far higher than previously thought. The experts found that on average sunbeds in England are emitting harmful radiation that is twice as high as the recommended safe levels. They have calculated that a ten minute session on a sunbed is twice as likely to cause skin cancer than spending the same time in the midday sun in the Mediterranean. Dangerous: using a sunbed is twice as likely to give you skin cancer than a holiday in the Mediterranean . The World Health Organisation has stated that sunbeds are as lethal as cigarettes and they are listed as one of the most dangerous, cancer-causing habits. But until now there has been limited information on the risks posed by sunbeds in this country. Last year the Government banned the under 18s from using the sunbeds but there are fears this law is not being properly enforced. Many gyms and beauty salons run coin-operated sunbeds which aren't supervised so there is nothing to stop teenagers using them as often as they want. Professor Harry Moseley, who carried out the research, accused the sunbed industry of putting young women and other users at risk. 'This situation is unacceptable and stricter control measures must be put in place.' 'The development of high-power sunlamps, along with clear failures of the sunbed industry to regulate themselves effectively, is putting young people at an even greater risk of skin cancer than we previously thought.' Healthier option: A woman sunbathing by the pool for ten minutes in the midday sun in the Mediterranean is half as likely to get skin cancer than someone who spends ten minutes on a sun bed . The researchers from the University of Dundee tested the strength of radiation emitted by sunbeds at 402 tanning salons and beauticians in England. They also estimated the risk of skin cancer and compared this to natural sunlight. Their findings, published in the British Journal of Dermatology, show that 90 per cent of sunbeds are emitting radiation that is higher than the safety standards set by the EU. And the radiation produced by one sunbed was so strong it was six times more likely to cause skin cancer than the Mediterranean sun. Cases of malignant melanoma - the deadliest skin cancer - have doubled in the last decade, according to figures from Cancer Research UK. Around 13,000 Britons are diagnosed with the illness each year and it causes 2,800 deaths. Research has previously found that a using a sunbed before the age of 35 increases the risk of malignant melanoma by nearly 90 per cent. Yinka Ebo, senior health information officer at Cancer Research UK, which funded the study said: 'It's worrying to see that so many sunbeds in England are not meeting the safety standards. 'This strengthens our advice that using a sunbed just isn't worth it.'","Sunbeds in England emitting radiation twice the safe level .

Nestlé, the world's biggest food company, has removed several beef pasta ready meals from sale in Italy and Spain after finding traces of horse DNA. It is hugely embarrassing for the Swiss-based giant, because just last week . it insisted its products had not been affected by the scandal. But last night the firm admitted its own tests . had found more than one per cent horse DNA in two products. Recall: Nestlé has been forced to withdraw processed beef products from shops in Italy and Spain .

'We have informed the authorities accordingly,' Nestlé said in a statement on Monday. 'There is no food safety issue.' Nestle withdrew two chilled pasta products, Buitoni Beef Ravioli and Beef Tortellini, in Italy and Spain. Lasagnes à la Bolognaise Gourmandes, a catering product produced in France, will also be withdrawn. The company insists that none of its products on sale in the UK are affected. Scandal: Frozen foods company Findus is one of the firms which has been forced to withdraw frozen products . Nestlé has suspended deliveries of all products made using beef from a German subcontractor to one of its suppliers. Governments across Europe have stressed that horsemeat poses little or no health risk, although some carcasses have been found tainted with a painkiller banned for human consumption. But the scandal has damaged the confidence of consumers in supermarkets and fast food chains since horsemeat was first identified in Irish beefburgers. Budget retailer Lidl said on Monday it had withdrawn products from its stores in Finland and Sweden after finding traces of horsemeat. Other supermarket chains which have been drawn in to the scandal include Tesco and Asda, while frozen foods company Findus was forced to withdraw its beef lasagne. Two men, a Yorkshire farmer and the owner of a meat processing plant in Wales, have been arrested and bailed over allegations they knowingly allowed contaminated beef to enter the food chain.","Pasta ready meals made with tainted beef withdrawn from sale in Europe .

The Transportation Security Administration has offered an apology to a Missouri family after one of their agents detained their wheelchair-bound three-year-old daughter. The organization issued a statement apologizing for the ‘inaccurate guidance’ that was provided to Nathan and Annie Forck and their daughter, Lucy as they tried to fly to their Disney World vacation. A video taken by Mrs Forck on the day of their February flight show the child weeping and asking for her stuffed animal, ‘Lamby’ as a TSA agent tells Mrs Forck she cannot film the patdown. Scroll down for video . Trail of tears: Lucy, pictured bottom, was in tears after a TSA agent subjected the three-year-old girl to a full patdown; the TSA later issued an apology . Upset: Throughout the patdown, the little girl was weeping and saying: 'i don't want to go to Disney World.' The family was flying to Orlando from their home in Missouri; Lucy has spinal bifida . TSA told MailOnline in a statement: . ‘TSA regrets inaccurate guidance was provided to this family during . screening and offers its apology. 'We are committed to maintaining the . security of the traveling public and strive to treat all passengers with . dignity and respect. While no patdown was performed, we will address . specific concerns with our workforce.’ Lucy, who has spinal bifida, was . sobbing throughout the whole patdown. ‘Lamby’ was sent through for an . X-ray machine, and her hot pink wheelchair was swabbed down. Speaking with ABC News, Mrs Forck said that they accept the apology, but they want TSA . agents to receive more sensitivity training with regards to how to . handle children and the disabled. Acceptance: Annie and Nathan Forck said they accept the TSA's apology but said they'd like to see the agents better trained in sensitivity and how to handle children and those in wheelchairs .

Happiest place on earth: The family of five made it to Disney World in one piece and posted this snap on Twitter . ‘It bothers me because my daughter was . singled out specifically because my daughter is in a wheelchair,’ Mr . Forck told ABC News. As Fox News Radio reports, the Forcks were attempting to fly to Orlando to enjoy a family vacation at Disney World and were flying out of Lambert-St Louis International Airport in Missouri. Though they got through the TSA security checkpoint without incident, a TSA agent pulled the family aside to screen Lucy’s wheelchair further for a pat down and swabbing her mobility device. Mrs Forck pulled out her smart phone and began recording the whole event, against the TSA agent’s request. ‘It’s illegal to do that,’ the female agent is heard saying. Mrs Forcks responds: ‘You can’t touch my daughter unless I can record it,’ and later adds: ‘The problem is, I don’t allow anyone to touch my little daughter.’ Throughout the argument between the mother and the TSA agent, Lucy can be heard crying, apparently confused at what exactly was going on. Her stuffed animal, ‘Lamby,’ had been scanned via X-ray and had not been returned to her. Know your rights: Mother Annie Forck filmed the entire patdown and said she had the right to film it, despite the TSA agent's protest . At one point Lucy's beloved stuffed animal Lamby was taken from her as well . Mr Forck, an attorney, told Fox News . that he knew it was legal to record the event and said that if the same . instance had occurred outside the setting of an airport, it would be . illegal. ‘But you put a TSA badge on and now all of a sudden, it’s okay,’ he told the station. The father added that he and his wife were not trying to make a scene, but instead were looking out for the well-being of their daughter. The TSA later admitted its agents should never have threatened to patdown the little girl and apologized to the family. According to the TSA website, ‘passengers who can neither stand nor walk will be screened by a thorough patdown while they remain seated.’ The site adds: ‘A patdown procedure is used to resolve any alarms of a metal detector or anomalies identified by imaging technology.’ Checkpoint: The TSA states on its website that those in wheelchairs and scooters who cannot walk must go through a comprehensive patdown . The government agency offers a notification card for those with medical issues, but it is clearly stated on the card that presenting it to agents doesn’t exempt passengers from screening. Mr Forck told Fox News that Lucy had no problem coming through Orlando’s TSA checkpoint. And while she was at Disney World, she got to meet Mickey Mouse.

The 'Le cimetiere des chiens et Autres Animaux Domestiques' - which translates as 'Cemetery of Dogs and Other Domestic Animals' - was founded in 1899. It was built following the introduction of a French law in 1898 that put a stop to the practice of Parisians burying pets where they liked or throwing the bodies into the rubbish or river. The Le cimetiere des chiens et Autres Animaux Domestiques - which translates as Cemetery of Dogs and Other Domestic Animals - was founded in 1899 .

Pacha and Darius both reached adolescence and share the same plot . The entrance gate to Le cimetiere des chiens et Autres Animaux Domestiques. Tucked away in a suburb of Paris, this is the world's oldest pet cemetery . The new law decreed that domestic animals could be buried, provided they were at least 100 metres from human dwellings and were covered by at least a metre of earth. Today the cemetery in Asnieres-sur-Seine, a commune in the northwestern suburbs of Paris,  is filled with elaborate tombs to beloved pets. Famous residents include the canine star of 27 Hollywood films Rin Tin Tin who at one point is said to have received the most votes for the Academy Award for Best Actor - but was declined because he wasn't human. Patrick Roberts, 73, from North Wales, visited the cemetery to see for himself the hidden treasure outside the French capital. Patrick, who runs the website Purr-n-fur, said: 'It contains not only dogs, but a fair number of cats and a variety of other species, including a lion, a monkey, a racehorse, mice, birds, rabbits and more, even fish. 'The founders of the cemetery, lawyer Georges Harmois and journalist Marguerite Durand, formed a company and acquired a strip of land on a small island near the Pont de Clichy, which is where it remains today, although the site is no longer an island it is close to the river.

'The cemetery is still in use, although apparently many residents of Asnieres are unaware of its existence. 'Just inside the site, near the entrance, the visitor is greeted by a large and elaborate memorial dedicated to the legendary St Bernard dog Barry, who died in 1814. 'According to the inscription he was responsible for saving 40 lives in the Swiss Alps, including that of a young boy trapped on an icy, inaccessible ledge. 'But Barry was killed in the rescue of the 41st person. Barry himself is not actually buried here, his body was stuffed and is displayed in the Swiss Natural History Museum in Bern.' Patrick said despite being very popular at the start the cemetery did fall on hard times in recent years and was almost closed. He said: 'By 1986 severe financial problems caused the administrative council to decide to stop any further activity and to close it for good from September 1987. Tipsy has a round headstone (left) while the cat on the right is surrounded by flowers. The cemetery is also home to a lion, a monkey, a racehorse, mice, birds, rabbits and fish .

'Our baby darling Kiki', 15, (left) and Cachou, 29, and Smoky, 13, (right) rest here. 'However, supporters and lovers of the old cemetery, had other ideas. As a result the mayor's department of the town prepared a plan to save it and requested the state authorities to list the site as one of historical interest. 'Eventually this was agreed and it was recognised as being of 'picturesque, artistic, historical and legendary interest' and its immediate future was secured. 'Work was done to consolidate the river bank at the site, and from February 1, 1997, the community of Asnihres took over responsibility for the cemetery.' Patrick said the memorials to pets range from the simple unmarked to the very elaborate. He said: 'Often you'll see graves with a picture of the cat or dog, and then you'll see them modified to have another added and the pets are buried in the same plot. 'The French seem to have really gone overboard with some of the memorials perhaps as only the French can.' Saving a place?

A federal appeals court has dramatically halted the execution of a Georgia man 30-minutes before he was due to die by lethal injection. Warren Hill was scheduled to die via lethal injection on Tuesday at 7 p.m. but was granted a dramatic successful stay of execution this evening . Warren Lee Hill was set to be executed at 7 p.m. Tuesday night, but shortly before the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the stay on claims by Hill that he was mentally disabled and thus ineligible for execution, Brian Kammer, Hill’s lawyer, said. The 52-year-old death-row prisoner was sentenced to death in 1990 for the lethal beating of fellow inmate Joseph Handspike with a board studded with nails to the distress of other inmates. At the time of the murder, Hill was already serving a life sentence for the 1986 murder of his girlfriend, Myra Wright, who he shot 11 times. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued the ruling for Warren Lee Hill as corrections officials prepared his lethal injection for later in the evening. Earlier in the day, the state parole board, the Supreme Court of Georgia and the U.S. Supreme Court had all declined to stop the execution. 'We are greatly relieved that the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has stayed the execution of Warren Hill, a person with mental retardation. 'All the doctors who have examined Mr. Hill are unanimous in their diagnosis of mental retardation,' defense attorney Brian Kammer said in an email. 'I think we were within about a half hour of the execution.' Hill's lawyers argue that he is mentally disabled and therefore shouldn't be executed. The state maintains that the defense failed to meet its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Hill is mentally disabled. Hill has received support from various activists and from former President Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn. 'Georgia should not violate its own prohibition against executing individuals with serious diminished capacity,' President Carter said in a statement. Clemency: Members of the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles prepare to hear a clemency hearing for Hill last July - which they turned down . Earlier this week a fierce legal battled rage over the death penalty sentence of Hill, who was scheduled to be executed at 7 p.m. tonight in Georgia. Despite originally testifying for the state, three doctors who claimed that Hill was not mentally disabled dramtically changed their minds. Hill’s lawyers have continually argued that their client has had mental issues for the duration of his incarceration, and are doing everything in their power to spare his life. Authorities said that Hill, who was already serving a life sentence for the murder of his girlfriend, Maya Wright four years earlier, attacked Handspike again and again with a nail embedded in a piece of plank. Handspike died of his injuries. However, the Handspike family has publically declared that they do not agree with Hill’s execution. Hill’s upcoming lethal injection would have gone directly against the 2002 case, Atkins v. Virginia, which ruled that Daryl Atkins was ‘mentally retarded’ and was not of sound mind, and therefore could not be sentenced to death. Dr Thomas Sachy wrote in an affidavit last week: ‘Having reviewed my earlier evaluation results and the far more extensive materials from the record of this case, I believe that my judgement that Mr Hill did not meet the criteria for mild mental retardation was in error.’ Watchful: A corrections officer stands guard with a shotgun on the main road into the Georgia Diagnostic Prison in Jackson, Georgia last July after a 30-day stay of execution was announced for condemned murderer Hill . The other doctors concede and claimed their evaluations of Hill in 2000 were ‘rush jobs,’ according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Previous to this evening, the state said that Hill’s lawyers failed to prove ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ that the man is mentally disabled. Outrage: Troy Davis was the last Georgia inmate to be executed in the state; his 2011 death was highly controversial . Lauren Kane, a spokesperson for the state Attorney General’s Office, declined comment, at the time. Hill was originally scheduled to be executed in June, but the Supreme Court allowed him a stay of execution while his attorneys pursued a challenge based on the state’s changing of execution method. Hill is among three Georgia inmates on Death Row fighting for a court order that would prevent the state from using a drug to execute them without a doctor’s prescription first. Hill, along with Andrew Allen Cook and Marcus Wellons, argue that the Georgia Department of Corrections’ use of the drug without a doctor’s prescription violates the federal Controlled Substances Act. Even if the court finds him mentally disabled, Hill would still spend the rest of his life in prison, the Journal-Constitution says. The case has stirred a national outcry of those believing Hill to be mentally unwell. If he is executed, it will be the first carried-out execution in the state since the 2011 death of Troy Davis. At the time, Davis’ conviction and condemnation drew fury, as many believed that Davis was the victim of mistaken identity in the murder of Burger King guard Mark MacPhail in 1989. Prosecutors and MacPhail's family said they were certain Davis was guilty and that justice was served. Prison officials also provided an audio recording and transcript of his last words, which he used to again proclaim his innocence and urge his supporters to ""continue to fight this fight."" Davis was notified of the execution date on Sept. 7, and a day later he was asked to make a last meal request. He scrawled a response in big letters: ""None. Will Be Fasting!"" According to figures collected by Amnesty International, the U.S. was the only country within the G8 to carry out executions in 2011.","Warren Lee Hill was granted a stay of execution by a federal appeals court moments before he was due to face a lethal injection .

A schoolboy has been excluded for allegedly performing a Nazi salute in class to his teacher. A teacher accused Ben Hayward, 14, of making the racist hand gesture while clicking his heels and saying 'Heil Hitler' at Meopham School, in Meopham, Kent. The boy denies using the phrase and clicking his heels, and says he was unaware he was being 'racist' when he stretched out his left arm to imitate his teacher, who was using her hand to signal for the class to be quiet. Ben Hayward, 14, with father Scott, maintains he was not being racist and was only mimicking his teacher . Following the incident in November last year, Ben was punished with a two-hour detention after school. However Ben and his parents refused to accept the punishment and demanded a meeting with the school to have the incident thoroughly investigated. Not backing down: Mr Hayward wanted the matter 'properly investigated' His father Scott Hayward said: 'We asked the school to talk to the teacher as we thought she may have misjudged the incident as racist. 'At most it could have been seen as undermining her authority but definitely not racist. 'If investigated properly with witness statements from the other 20 or so children there, it would show the teacher was mistaken.' Although the detention was postponed, headteacher Matthew Munro contacted the Haywards in January to say Ben must serve the punishment but the school was prepared to no longer describe the incident as racist. Scott, 41, said: 'We refused as we said all along we wouldn't accept a change of accusation, especially after accusing our son of racism without further investigation and causing so much upset to all our family.' On Friday, Ben came home from school and told his parents he had been in exclusion for the day. His father says Ben had his phone taken away from him and 'all communication with the other children was severed.' Mr Hayward, who lives with Ben in Cuxton, Kent added: 'It's been upsetting because Ben has been questioned again and again because we've not been getting answers from the school. 'But we stick by our son.' Mr Hayward says he is now going to lodge a complaint with the board of governors. The school says Ben must serve the punishment but it was prepared to no longer describe the incident as racist . Headteacher Matthew Munro said: 'The standard procedure when students have an after school detention is if they miss it twice they will have a day of internal exclusion in our internal exclusion unit. 'We had discussions with Mr and Mrs Hayward and we did agree we wouldn't categorise it as a racist incident but that it would be a serious incident and the punishment would stand. 'A racist incident is defined by perception of other people rather than the intention of the person who committed it and this is the point we tried to make. 'The fact remains a teacher took great exception and perceived the incident as racist.

Officials hope that these trick snakes will direct them to thousands of pythons hiding in the swamps and, most importantly, to breeding females. 'It's breeding time and females attract males and we have three eager young lads sitting out there with radio transmitters on them who can lead us to the breeding female and we can catch her,' Frank Mazzotti, wildlife professor and organizer of the competition, told ABC News. Scroll down for video . Sixty-eight Burmese pythons have been killed during month-long public hunt for the non-native species in the Florida Everglades . Fred Merrell, 48, hunts for pythons in the Big Cypress National Preserve during the Python Challenge in the Florida Everglades . 'Python Challenge' officials announced on . Saturday that just 68 snakes were killed during the public hunt that . attracted 1,600 people from over 30 states in the hope of cash prizes. No one is quite sure how many of the non-native species live in the Everglades but estimates have ranged up to 100,000 animals. Though . the final body count for the Python Challenge was fairly small, . organizers say they were very happy with the outcome of the hunt. 'Thanks to the determination of Python Challenge competitors, we are able to gather invaluable information that will help refine and focus combined efforts to control pythons in the Everglades,' Florida wildlife commission executive director Nick Wiley told CNN. As well as culling South Florida’s . population of the invasive snakes, the purpose of the hunt was also . to raise awareness about non-native species and their detrimental . effects on the local ecosystem. The pythons can grow up to 18 feet in length, but finding the camouflaged pythons in Florida's swampland wasn't easy. 'You can go out there for days and days and days and not see one python,' hunter Justin Matthews told CNN last month. 'I don't care how much experience you have. It is going to take some luck.' Officials said that challenge competitors had covered a million acres of swamp, brush and sawgrass. But these efforts weren't without rewards for the proud winners. Brian Barrows of Fort Myers, Florida, won a $1,500 grand prize in the amateur category for killing six pythons. In the professional category, Ruben Ramirez of Miami won the same amount for notching up 18 snakes. Paul Shannon, also from Florida, took home $1,000 for bagging the longest python (which was later realeased), which measured 14 feet, 3 inches. Captain Jeff Fobb, of Miami-Dade Fire Rescue's Venom One unit, explains the infestation problem to the media with the help of an 85-pound python . Two young men who became 'stranded and disoriented' while taking part in the hunt were rescued on February 7 by police piloting a chopper. The Broward County Sheriff's Office said units responded to a call about the missing men at about 4 p.m. Air rescue units began a search of the area, and the hunters were found a half-hour later. A helicopter landed in the Everglades and transported the two men to rescue units a few miles away. The victims, ages 22 and 25, 'complained of lightheadedness and weakness and were suffering from heat exhaustion and dehydration,' according to the news release from the sheriff's office. Firefighters were told they were from Tennessee. The men, who have not been identified, were treated at the scene and declined to be transported to a hospital. Hunters were restricted to four state wildlife management areas; Everglades National Park was off-limits. They were allowed to use some firearms, as well as captive bolts and machetes to kill the pythons. Florida state offered cash prizes to whoever brought in the longest python and whoever killed the most snakes . Captain Jeff Fobb displays a python during the kick-off ceremonies in January. This 13-foot snake was captured a year ago swimming in a backyard pool . Before the start of the hunt in January, dozens of would-be python . hunters showed up for some last-minute training in snake handling at the University of Florida. The training came down to common sense: Drink water, wear sunscreen, don't get bitten by anything and don't shoot anyone. Many of the onlookers were dressed in camouflage, though they probably didn't have to worry about spooking the snakes. They would have a much harder time spotting the splotchy, tan pythons in the long green grasses and woody brush of the Everglades. 'It's advantage-snake,' mechanical engineer Dan Keenan concluded after slashing his way through a quarter-mile of scratchy sawgrass, dried leaves and woody overgrowth near a campsite in the Big Cypress National Preserve, which is about 50 miles southeast of Naples and is supervised by the National Park Service. Keenan, of Merritt Island, and friend Steffani Burd of Melbourne, a statistician in computer security, holstered large knives and pistols on their hips, so they'd be ready for any python that crossed their path. Dan Keenan battles through thick brush in search for Burmese pythons, also described as the 'zombies of the Everglades' The most useful tool they had, though, was the key fob to their car. Burd wanted to know that they hadn't wandered too far into the wilderness, so Keenan clicked the fob until a reassuring beep from their car chirped softly through the brush. The recommended method for killing pythons is the same for killing zombies: a gunshot to the brain, or decapitation to reduce the threat. (The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals doesn't approve of the latter method, though.) Pythons are kind of the zombies of the Everglades, though their infestation is less deadly to humans. The snakes have no natural predators, they can eat anything in their way, they can reproduce in large numbers and they don't belong here. Florida currently prohibits . possession or sale of the pythons for use as pets, and federal law bans . the importation and interstate sale of the species. Wildlife . experts say pythons are just the tip of the invasive species iceberg. Florida is home to more exotic species of amphibians and reptiles than . anywhere else in the world, said John Hayes, dean of research for the . University of Florida's Institute for Food and Agricultural Sciences. Careful lookout: Another hunter, BR Slocum, uses a golf cart as he searches for snakes with his son . Roughly 2,050 pythons have been harvested in Florida since 2000, according to the conservation commission. It's unknown exactly how many are slithering through the wetlands. Officials hope the competition will help rid the Everglades of the invaders while raising awareness about the risks that exotic species pose to Florida's native wildlife. Keenan and Burd emerged from the Everglades empty-handed, but they planned to return the next day, hoping for cooler temperatures that would drive heat-seeking snakes into sunny patches along roads and levees. Burd still deemed the hunt a success. 'For me, I take back to my friends and community that there is a beautiful environment out here. It's opening the picture from just the python issue to the issue of how do we protect our environment,' she said.

Pressure is mounting on the boss of Lloyds to give up his bonus after the bank was rocked by yet another fine relating to a mis-selling scandal. The Financial Services Authority yesterday fined the taxpayer-backed lender £4.3m for delays in paying out compensation to 140,000 customers missold payment protection insurance. It is another humiliation for the bank which, analysts believe, could see its PPI bill jump from the £5.3bn already set aside to £6.3bn. Under pressure: Antonio Horta-Osorio, CEO of Lloyds bank, is facing calls to give up his bonus . The Financial Services Authority described how inexperienced staff made errors and lost vital paperwork relating to mis-sold payment protection insurance. This resulted in delays for up to 140,000 customers, with 8,800 forced to wait more than six months for average payouts of £2,733. Tracey McDermott, director of enforcement and financial crime at the FSA, said Lloyds ‘fell well short of the standard the FSA expects’. Treasury Select Committee member John Mann said Mr Horta-Osorio should not be getting a bonus . Richard Lloyd, director of consumer . group Which?, said: ‘Banks must help consumers claim back the . compensation they are rightly due without hassle.’ Lloyds insisted all affected customers  had received their compensation, plus 8 per cent interest. A spokesman said: ‘We apologise to those whose payments were delayed'. Lloyds chief executive Antonio . Horta-Osorio immediately came under pressure to waive his bonus for . 2012, which could be as big as £5.3m on top of his £1.1m salary. He is also due to be paid 1.7m shares . in June this year, worth around £940,000 at last night’s closing price . of 55.26p, as part of the deal to hire him from rival Santander in early . 2011. Labour MP John Mann, a member of the influential Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘He should not be getting a bonus. This is a taxpayer-owned bank that he is running and has a poor performance. He should be paying money back not taking money out. This is a reward for incompetence and failure.’ Mark Fisher, the former Royal Bank of Scotland banker hired by Lloyds to integrate HBOS following the disastrous takeover during the financial crisis, also faces pressure to give up his bonus as he is overseeing the clean-up of the PPI scandal. Lloyds, which is yet to reveal how much its senior staff will get in bonuses, is set to post another set of huge losses when it announces annual results for 2012 on March 1. Referring to its bonus pay-outs, one insider at the bank said: ‘I don’t think anyone is expecting anywhere near the maximum.’ RBS chief executive Stephen Hester and . Barclays boss Antony Jenkins have both waived their bonuses for 2012 . after a year of shame for the industry – piling pressure on Horta-Osorio . to do the same.

Victim: Kaufman County assistant district attorney Mark Hasse, pictured, was murdered last month . The investigation into the murder of a Dallas assistant district attorney last month continues as investigators look to an Aryan Brotherhood for clues in the prosecutor’s death. Mark Hasse, who was an ADA in Kaufman County, was shot dead in the courthouse parking lot in January; authorities believe the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas to be behind the murder. Now, state officials have set up a makeshift command center in an old armory to better investigate the white supremacist group’s role in Hasse’s killing. The Dallas Morning News reports that while officials have been working round the clock to charge a people or persons with Hasse’s murder, they do not have any hot leads. No arrests have been made in the case, and Hasse’s autopsy report has not yet been released. However, a member of the U.S. Marshals Service out of San Antonio recently wrote in an email that the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas could be responsible for the ADA’s death. According to NBC DFW, the command center at the armory helps officials at the local, state, and federal level achieve better communication. And, since it is not open to the public, there are fewer risks of leaks that could compromise the investigation. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Crime scene: Law enforcement officers investigate the scene of a shooting in downtown Kaufman, Texas . Suspects: Authorities said they were searching for two suspects in the shooting; according to reports, they are believed to be members of the Texas Aryan Brotherhood . Kaufman County District Attorney Mike . McLelland told the station that his staff members are still deeply . troubled by Hasse’s murder, and are forced to walk through the parking . lot where he was murdered to get to the courthouse. ‘You see a shadow at your door, and it kind of looks like him. That happens several times a day,’ he told NBC DFW. Brotherhood member: James Marshall Meldrum is one of the alleged white supremecists involved in the trial Kaufman was prosecuting . The DA told the Morning News that he was not aware that Hasse had any involvement in Aryan Brotherhood Cases. The Aryan Brotherhood of Texas is a white supremacist prison gang formed in the 1960s. The reward for any information regarding his slaying has climbed to $71,000. The apparent assassination took place . at around 8:50 a.m on January 31 in a parking lot near the courthouse . where Hasse worked as a felony prosecutor who headed murder and drug . cases. Kaufman County Sheriff David Byrnes said he had never seen such a case in his four decade career. 'I've . been doing this 43 years and I have never experienced anything like . this before,' he told reporters at a Thursday afternoon news conference. Hasse was rushed to hospital where he died of his injuries. He was unmarried and had no children. Witnesses . told police they saw two suspects flee the scene in an older, silver . Ford Taurus. However, the number of suspects had not been verified. Kaufman Chief of Police Chris . Aulbaugh said the shooting appeared to be targeted at Hasse for a number . of reasons. 'The fact it was not an ongoing rampage, it was one . individual being shot and then (the gunmen) leaving the scene,' he said. 'It was a very small, very short confrontation.'

A widespread manhunt is underway for . the culprits with the help of police and sheriff's . departments from across the county. 'Every police department in the county is involved,' county spokesman Pat Laney said. Shortly after the prosecutor was shot and killed, the Department of Justice put out a statement crediting the Kaufman County District Attorney's Office with helping in the investigation of two known members of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas gang. The gang members pleaded guilty last month to racketeering charges, after Hasse's shooting. The release states that Ben Christian . Dillon, known as 'Tuff', of Houston, and James Marshall Meldrum, aka 'Dirty' both 'agreed to commit multiple acts of murder, robbery, arson, . kidnapping and narcotics tracking' for the Aryan Brotherhood. Tragic: Mark Hasse, pictured in older footage, was unmarried and had no children but gave everything to his job . Tonya . Radcliffe, a board member on the Kaufman County Appraisal District . whose office is adjacent to the scene of the shooting, told NBC that a staff member heard the gunshots and called police. Radcliffe said she and her staff of . about 25 were in the building and under lockdown along with seven Kaufman . Independent School District campuses. Lawyer . James Lee Bright, who arrived at the Kaufman courthouse just as . officers flooded the scene, told the Dallas News that the veteran . prosecutor had worked on numerous cases over his career that could be . connected. Closed: The Kaufman County Courthouse, pictured, was closed after Hasse's shooting . 'When you hear a DA at 8:40 in the morning is gunned down by two people, I think there's a reasonable presumption that it's not random,' he said. Defense lawyer Eric Smenner told the Dallas News that he immediately feared Hasse had been targeted. 'I felt it very certainly had to be work-related,' he said. Smenner added that Hasse parked in the same area of the courtroom parking lot each day. 'So if somebody was out to get him all they'd have to do is watch him a little bit,' he told the Dallas News. According to CBS, Mark Hasse graduated from Southern Methodist University in 1981 and had been licensed to practice law since 1982. The 57-year-old had been a Kaufman County District Attorney since July of 2010. He was chief of the Dallas County district attorney’s organized-crime section from 1985 until 1988.

His bill, presented on Sunday, read: . ‘Any member of the general assembly who proposes a piece of legislation . that further restricts the right of an individual to bear arms, as set . forth under the second amendment of the Constitution of the United .

In Congress it was revealed that an assault weapons ban would protect more than 2,200 firearms, including a semi-automatic rifle nearly identical to one used in the bloodiest shootout in FBI history. One model of that firearm, the Ruger .223 caliber Mini-14, is on the proposed banned list, while a different model of the same gun is on a list of exempted firearms in legislation the Senate is considering. The gun that would be protected from the ban has fixed physical features and can't be folded to be more compact. Yet the two firearms are equally deadly. A bill introduced last month by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. would ban 157 specific firearms designed for military and law enforcement use and exempt others made for hunting purposes. It also would ban ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.","Republican Mike Leara wants to make it a class D felony if any General Assembly member tries to introduce legislation again right to bear arms .

An Ohio woman who has admitted voting for President Obama twice in last year's election is now being investigated for casting a total of six ballots. Melowese Richardson, who lives in Cincinnati, told a local television station that she voted as an 'absentee' as well as at the polling station because she ‘certainly wanted my vote to count.’ But authorities are now concerned the grandmother may have voted six times using the names of other people in Hamilton County. Scroll down for video . Early and often? Melowese Richardson told a local Cincinnati news station that she voted twice for Obama during the November elections . Rallying point: Mr Obama pictured at a campaign rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, two days before his election; he won 50.7 percent of the popular vote in the state . Richardson, a veteran poll worker of 25 years, told Cincinnati station WCPO-TV, that she voted twice for President Obama at the polls in November. ‘I, after registering thousands of people, certainly wanted my vote to count, so I voted,’ she said. The Hamilton County Board of Election’s director, Amy Searcy, told MailOnline that a certain amount of ‘anomalies’ pop up during every election. This year, she said, there were more than 80. ‘As we nailed down the anomalies, some required further information,’ she explained, adding that some refused to return phone calls or answer subpoenas. Ms Searcy said that she was not allowed to publically comment on the board’s on-going investigation, but said that they could make a ruling by Friday, their next board meeting. ‘The law requires us to report the facts the prosecutor’s office for further investigation and to Jon Husted, the Ohio secretary of state,’ she said. But Fox News reported that three other absentee ballots in the names of different people were submitted to the Board of Elections from Richardson's address on Nov. 1. It is claimed that the handwriting on those ballots is similar and that they were all received together - and on the same day that Richardson's absentee ballot arrived at the office. Richardson, who says the other voters live at her house, told the local station that the votes were 'absolutely legal votes'. Casting ballots: Voters in Ohio put in their choices; in Hamilton County, there were around 80 anomalies, but 19 people are now under investigation for voter fraud . The longtime poll worker said: ‘There was absolutely no intent on my part to commit any voter fraud,’ according to Fox News. Richardson said that she thought she . sent an absentee ballot but was afraid it would not be counted, so she . went to a polling site in-person to cast her vote. Jon Husted, Ohio’s secretary of state, told the conservative news channel that Richardson ‘appears to have used her position as a poll worker to cover her tracks.’ Mr Hustead told Fox News that he was especially troubled ‘because it is my responsibility to make sure the system runs effectively, that it has integrity.’ American right: Voters cast their ballots at the Franklin County in-person absentee voting location in Columbus, Ohio this year . The secretary of state had controversially attempted to restrict early voting on the last three days before the November 6 election. He was rebuffed by a Supreme Court ruling, though his attempted restriction caused plenty of confusion at the polls. Mr Obama won the popular vote in the Buckeye State with 2,827,621 votes to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney’s 2,661,407, winning 50.7 percent of the popular vote, and 332 Electoral College votes to Mr Romney’s 206. It is a well-known fact that no Republican presidential candidate has won the election without first winning the state of Ohio.

Lance Armstrong won't interview under oath with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency to reveal all he knows about doping in cycling, his attorney has said. USADA officials had told Armstrong he must speak with them if he wanted to reduce his lifetime ban from cycling and compete again - and today was the deadline. After more than two months of negotiations, Armstrong attorney Tim Herman said today that the cyclist won't participate in a process designed 'only to demonize selected individuals.' Refusal: Lance Armstrong won't interview under oath with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, which may have been his only chance at ending his lifetime ban from cycling . Armstrong had previously said he was willing to participate in an international effort to clean up a sport that is based mostly in Europe. For years, Armstrong denied using performance-enhancing drugs. But last year, USADA released a report that detailed extensive doping on his seven Tour de France-winning teams and stripped him of those titles. Armstrong then admitted last month in an . interview with 'Queen of Talk' Oprah Winfrey that he doped and used . performance-enhancing drugs to win those races. 'We remain hopeful that an international . effort will be mounted and we will do everything we can to facilitate . that result,' Mr Herman said in a statement.

'Lance will not participate in USADA's efforts to selectively conduct American prosecutions that only demonize selected individuals while failing to address the 95 per cent of the sport over which USADA has no jurisdiction.' Armstrong is facing several legal challenges, and testifying under oath to USADA could have exposed him to further troubles. Armstrong was the subject of a two-year federal criminal investigation that was dropped in February with no charges filed, but the Department of Justice is still considering whether to join a federal whistle-blower lawsuit filed by former Armstrong teammate Floyd Landis.

Thousands of British ski guides could end up losing their jobs after being banned from showing guests around the French slopes. A court in France has ruled that safety is compromised when tour operators provide holidaymakers with informal tours of the piste. But a British ski company, which is to appeal the ruling, has said the court 'has taken the side of the locals and the protectionist agenda' of the French ski school, Ecole du Ski Francais. A court in France has ruled that British ski hosts cannot show holidaymakers around the French slopes . In the past tens of thousands of British holidaymakers have enjoyed the experience each winter. They are shown around the resort and the best slopes and restaurants are pointed out. The ski hosts did not take skiers on the most advanced runs and did not instruct. Monday’s ruling in Albertville is being seen by British firms as a test case that threatens the future of ski companies offering such a service. The court ruled that the practice breaks French law which cites that leaders of organised groups on the slopes must be qualified instructors. French authorities, together with the ESF national ski school, singled out a British operator in Les Trois Vallees, Le Ski, which provided the service free of charge, and took it to court. UK tour operators say they are bitterly disappointed by the decision to outlaw British tour operators . The co-founder of Le Ski, Nick Morgan, has said he will appeal the ruling. 'As we expected, the court in Albertville has taken the side of the locals and the protectionist agenda of the ESF. We will be appealing and the case now goes to a court in Chambery. The fight goes on and we will take this all the way,' he said. 'We are determined to carry on and we are not prepared to see British ski hosting outlawed. By taking the British on in this way the French Authorities, and the ESF, have created a problem where there really wasn’t one.' The dispute began when a ski host, employed by Le Ski, was stopped by police on the pistes in Meribel – a popular destination for British skiers, in Les Trois Vallees region. The ski host was informed that his actions were illegal, and was told to report to the Courchevel police. The French ski instructors’ union joined the French police in pressing charges. Jean-Marc Simon, director of the ski instructors’ union, said at the time: 'This is purely about ski safety. We cannot have unqualified people taking groups of skiers around the mountain. We did not instigate this investigation, but as people responsible for mountain safety we must support the authorities.' Other UK tour operators say they are bitterly disappointed by the decision. Crystal Ski, the UK’s largest ski tour operator, said: 'Crystal Ski is disappointed with the court ruling, however, we are pleased to hear that the tour operator has decided to appeal.’ A statement from ESF read: 'ESF is committed to ensuring the safety of UK tourists using French resorts for wintersports. 'ESF reiterates its commitment to supporting the UK ski industry and will work with UK tour operators in finding workable solutions for lawful guiding on the French ski slopes.' The current row is the latest in a long line of disputes between the French and British ski professionals. The French lost a long-running battle to prevent British-qualified ski instructors from teaching in their country in 2000.","A French court has said that unofficial tour operators compromise safety .

The smallest known planet outside our solar system has been detected by NASA's alien-hunting Kepler space telescope. It is slightly larger than our Moon and orbits its host star every 13 days. The planet, named Kepler-37b, has a surface temperature of more than of 400 degrees centigrade, making water, and therefore life, impossible. An artist's conception for the planet Kepler-37b. This planet is slightly larger than our own Moon and orbits its host star every 13 days. It likely has a surface temperature of in excess of 400 deg C (700 deg F). Owing to its small size and hot surface the planet is very likely rocky with no significant atmosphere, similar to Mercury in our own Solar System. The newly discovered planets are located in a system called Kepler-37, about 210 light-years from Earth in the constellation Lyra. The smallest planet, Kepler-37b, is slightly larger than our moon, measuring about one-third the size of Earth. It is smaller than Mercury, which made its detection a challenge. Owing to its tiny size and hot surface, it is very likely rocky with no atmosphere, similar to Mercury in our own Solar System. It orbits the Sun-like star with two other planets, one slightly larger and the other twice as big as Earth. 'Even Kepler can only detect such a tiny world around the brightest stars it observes,' said Jack Lissauer, a planetary scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center. 'The fact we've discovered tiny Kepler-37b suggests such little planets are common, and more planetary wonders await as we continue to gather and analyze additional data.' Kepler-37b is about 80 percent the size of Mercury and is the first 'exoplanet' to be found that is smaller than any in our own Solar System. Discoveries of exoplanets - those that lie outside the Solar System - have helped to increase our knowledge of planetary systems and have revealed they can look quite dissimilar to ours. Until recently, researchers had only been able to detect and probe larger exoplanets, and none had been found that are smaller than those seen in the Solar System. Astronomer Thomas Barclay, a research scientist at the NASA Ames Research Centre, said: 'Since the discovery of the first exoplanets, it has been known other planetary systems can look quite unlike our own. 'Until fairly recently, we have been able to probe only the upper range of the planet size distribution and, since last year, to detect planets that are the size of Earth or somewhat smaller. 'Hitherto, no planets have been found that are smaller than those we see in the Solar System. 'Here we report a planet significantly smaller than Mercury. Two of the three planets orbiting Kepler-37 are smaller than the Earth while the third is twice Earth's size. Kepler-37b is about 80% the size of Mercury and is the first exoplanet to be found that is smaller than any planet in our own Solar System. 'This tiny planet is the innermost of three that orbit the Sun-like host star, which we have designated Kepler-37. 'Owing to its extremely small size, similar to that of the moon, and highly irradiated surface, the planet, Kepler-37b, is probably rocky with no atmosphere or water, similar to Mercury.' He added: 'Although sub-Mercury-sized planets are expected from theory and their space-based detection has previously been predicted, our detection of Kepler-37b is remarkable given this transit signal would be detected in the data of fewer than 0.5% of the stars observed by Kepler. 'Although the detection of one planet cannot be used to determine occurrence rates, it does lend weight to the belief planet occurrence increases exponentially with decreasing planet size.' The Kepler space observatory, named after the 17th century German astronomer Johannes Kepler, was launched on 7 March 2009 to survey a portion of the Milky Way for Earth-size planets that could harbour life. In January astronomers used Kepler's data to estimate ""at least 17 billion"" such exoplanets reside in our galaxy. The research team used data from NASA's Kepler space telescope, which simultaneously and continuously measures the brightness of more than 150,000 stars every 30 minutes. When a planet candidate transits, or passes, in front of the star from the spacecraft's vantage point, a percentage of light from the star is blocked. This causes a dip in the brightness of the starlight that reveals the transiting planet's size relative to its star. The size of the star must be known in order to measure the planet's size accurately. To learn more about the properties of the star Kepler-37, scientists examined sound waves generated by the boiling motion beneath the surface of the star. They probed the interior structure of Kepler-37's star just as geologists use seismic waves generated by earthquakes to probe the interior structure of Earth. The science is called asteroseismology. The sound waves travel into the star and bring information back up to the surface. The waves cause oscillations that Kepler observes as a rapid flickering of the star's brightness. Like bells in a steeple, small stars ring at high tones while larger stars boom in lower tones. The barely discernible, high-frequency oscillations in the brightness of small stars are the most difficult to measure. This is why most objects previously subjected to asteroseismic analysis are larger than the sun. With the very high precision of the Kepler instrument, astronomers have reached a new milestone. 'The star Kepler-37, with a radius just three-quarters of the sun, now is the smallest bell in the asteroseismology steeple,' Nasa said.","The planet, named Kepler-37b, has a .

Highclere Castle in Hampshire may be best known today as TV's Downton Abbey, but the stately home has long been famous for its connection to a much older aristocratic dynasty. Its owners, the Carnarvon family, were central to the hunt for the tomb of Tutankhamun, which led to one of the most spectacular archaeological discoveries in history. Now the spectacular tomb has been rebuilt in the basement of the house, allowing visitors to recreate the experience of the explorers who first stumbled upon the ancient Egyptian treasure 90 years ago. Reconstruction: The scene at an exhibition in Highclere Castle celebrating the tomb of Tutankhamun . Spectacular: Egyptian ambassador Ashraf El Kholy looks at the exhibits with the Countess of Carnarvon . Unique: The Countess poses with a camel in front of the famous home in Hampshire . The current Countess is confident that . Highclere's association with Tutankhamun will ensure its lasting fame - . and says that Dowton 'will come and go' by comparison. In 1922, the 5th Earl of Carnarvon joined famed adventurer Howard Carter on an expedition in the Valley of the Kings hunting for the hidden tombs of Egyptian pharaohs. The key moment came when the pair broke through a gold wall and found themselves in the 'shrine room' of the boy-king's tomb. Highclere's Egyptian Exhibition is a replica of the scene they discovered in Tutankhamun's tomb, with reproductions of iconic artefacts such as the pharaoh's coffin and death mask. Accurate: The exhibition is filled with exact replicas of the contents of Tutankhamun's tomb . Stunning: The discovery of the tomb in 1922 thrilled the world and became a totemic moment for Egypt . Striking: One of the beautiful exhibits featured in the exhibition being held in Highclere's basement . 'This is the defining thing for Highclere,' the Countess of Carnarvon said at the launch of the exhibition. 'Downton is lovely, but it will come and go. 'The discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb is the greatest archaeological discovery ever. 'I want people to feel they're inside the tomb and they have a sense of history.' She added that some members of the Downton Abbey cast had visited the exhibition - but claimed that few of them had the time to appreciate their surroundings during filming of the ITV period drama. 'They're in such a beautiful place and they don't sort of know it,' the Countess said. Famous: Tutankhamun's golden death mask is one of the best-known monuments of ancient Egypt . Pride: Mr El Kholy takes a clsoer look at a replica of the pharaoh's elaborate coffin . But she also took time to praise the impact the hit show had on the public profile of Highclere and said it had helped support the Tutankhamun exhibition. 'In 100 years' time people are still going to be wondering and admiring the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb, and Downton will have helped us keep going,' she said. Ashraf El Kholy, Egypt's ambassador to the UK, praised the exhibition, saying it was 'different than any other museum'. He added: 'It's educational, it shows you how people worked hard to discover something, and it gives you a feeling of the history and the process of discovery. 'It reflects the great interest British people have in Egypt.' Pose: The Countess and the ambassador got together to promote both Highclere and Tutankhamun . Visit: The Egyptian Exhibition will be open to the public over the Easter period . The ambassador said his favourite piece was a wooden sculpture of the pharaoh's head. 'They look to the very smallest details of the human face,' he said. 'The eyes and head are very well drawn. 'I think this was the magic of the Egyptians, they worked hard to create the reality and they gave part of their feelings to what they were capturing.' The Egyptian Exhibition will be open to the public during the Easter period. Recognisable: Highclere is best-known as the setting for ITV's hit period drama Downton Abbey . Tutankhamun was born around 1342 BC, during the 18th Dynasty of ancient Egypt. His father was the pharaoh Akhenaten and his mother, whose name is unknown, seems to have been Akhenaten's own sister. He ascended to the throne around 1332 BC, at the age of just nine, meaning that his reign is likely to have been dominated by a group of powerful older advisers. Tutankhamun's time on the throne is considered most notable for his decision to roll back a number of radical innovations in religion which were initiated by his father. He died after reigning just 10 years, when he was still a teenager, and while the precise cause of his death is unknown it is possible that it may be linked to the fact that he was the product of incest. His tomb was discovered on November 4, 1922, and due to its nearly untouched state it caused a global sensation and has since become one of Egypt's most iconic treasures.","Earl of Carnarvon, who helped find Egyptian monument, lived at Highclere .

Recep Cetin, 17, arrested for the killing of his girlfriend's mother, Marion Graham, 53, and her . friend, Kathy Dinsmore, 53, is said to have confessed after eight-and-a-half hours of . questioning. He told . Turkish police that he'd planned to marry his Irish girlfriend Shannon . Graham, 15, and dreamed of starting a new life together in Ireland. Those dreams were shattered when Shannon's mother Marion flatly refused to give her permission for the match. After a last attempt to persuade . Marion to change her mind furious body-builder Cetin allegedly slashed and stabbed . her more than 15 times in a remote forest near Izmir in Turkey on Thursday. According to police horrified Kathy . Dinsmore tried to flee the bloodbath but Cetin hunted her down and dealt . her the same savage fate. The bodies of the two friends were found 20 . metres apart where Kathy was cut down as she tried to make a run for . it.  Both women were stabbed more than 15 times in the chest and both . had the knife plunged into their neck. Recep Cetin is accused of stabbing Marion Graham (left) and Kathy Dinsmore, from Northern Ireland . Shared: The house in Korukent, Kusadasi, where they all lived . Neighbours on the quiet estate where they family lived said . that Cetin and the Irish women had furious rows on a daily basis. The . Turkish next-door neighbours even stopped their children walking past the . three-storey villa - disturbed by the screaming, shouting and slapping . that constantly echoed from the house. It was after a particularly furious . row last week which saw Cetin kick Shannon that her mother Marion insisted . she was taking Shannon home, effectively ending the turbulent . relationship with Cetin. Cetin swore that he would kill her if she interfered and he was apparently  true to his word. Initially, Cetin, who dropped out of . school at 12, concocted an elaborate alibi in the hope that he'd removed . the only obstacle to his plans for a future with Shannon. After allegedly hacking her mother to death, Cetin returned 70 miles to his home in Kusadasi where he lay on . the ground outside the villa feigning unconsciousness. His Turkish neighbours, who asked not . to be named, said: ‘We saw him lying in the dirt outside his house on . Thursday afternoon. He was covered in mud and had a cut to his hand but . the blood had dried. ‘We went over to him and offered to . call an ambulance but he came to and told us he'd take a taxi to . hospital. On his way he dumped a bag in the rubbish bins. At that point . we had no idea what he'd done.' Recep Cetin is said to have confessed to the double murder after eight and a half hours in custody . Shannon arrived home from a boat trip to find Cetin cut and covered in dirt in the garden. He told her that while in the forest . in Izmir a black van pulled up and three men jumped out and abducted her . mother and Kathy. Cetin claimed that he put up a fight to defend the women . and was cut and knocked out in the ensuing struggle. But his implausible alibi fell apart . when he added that having been knocked out in the forest in Izmir he . woke in his garden in Kusadasi - and had no idea how he . got there.

But it didn't take them long to pull . apart the pack of lies that Cetin spun. After just eight and a half hours in custody . Cetin is said to have confessed to the killing, blaming the women for stealing his dream . future. Marion's ex-husband, Yucel Kilinc, a . Turkish waiter 10 years her junior, said yesterday: ‘Marion and I . married five years ago but we always argued and just couldn't make it . work so we separated three years ago. ‘When I heard what happened I was shocked and horrified. I just don't understand how this could have happened.’ Having packed her belongings Shannon . and her family left Korukent - although neighbours say she has returned on . a daily basis since the murders to feed and walk her puppy. The family are believed to be staying . in Turkey until they can return home with the bodies of the two dead . women later this week.

From TOWIE's Mark Wright and James Argent to Harry Styles and Nick Grimshaw, some men just can't hide their close friendships, or 'bromances' as they've come to be dubbed. But one pair of inseparable men spend an astonishing 98 per cent of their waking time together after forging a 13-year friendship. Lee Arnold, 23, and Neil Barnard, 24, who are proud of their TOWIE-style so-called 'Bromance', work, live, and sometimes even read in bed together. Bromance: Lee (left) and Neil (right) are two close pals who live and work together and have now been crowned Britain's most 'Bromantic couple' Despite their incredible closeness which also includes them wearing matching clothes, the pair, from Brighton, insist they are not gay. Much to the annoyance of their long-suffering girlfriends, the pair are rarely out of each other's sight 12 hours a day seven days a week. Lee even went for the same job role as Neil at a home improvement company - just so he could spend more time with his chum. Not content with spending just the working day together Neil then moved in with Lee and his girlfriend Jade, 25, just over a month ago. Inseparable: The inseparable pair spend an astonishing 98 per cent of their waking time together after forging a 13-year friendship but insist they are not gay . Today they were announced as 'Britain's biggest Bromance' after a two month nation-wide search of 7,000 entries. Neil, who is currently teaching Lee the acoustic guitar, said: 'He's my best mate and I love him. Not enough blokes say that enough about their friends. 'We've been inseparable since a young age and we're always having a laugh together. 'We just like being in each other's company. I would trust him with my life. 'The other day his mum phoned me up saying do you want to come to a Ronan Keating concert, so I took his mum out for the night. 'We'd do anything for each other. Matching: Much to the annoyance of their long-suffering girlfriends, the pair are rarely out of each other's sight and even match clothes . 'He's going to be best man at my wedding and I will at his. As long as our girlfriends don't break up with us.' The pals first met each other when they were just 11 years old and soon became best mates - even swapping their timetables so they could be in the same classes. Ever since, this friendship blossomed and after Lee was left on his own while soldier Neil served in Afghanistan, the pair made a vow never to leave each other's side once he returned. Lee added: 'We're just typical blokes. We like to go down the pub, have a laugh. Roomies: Neil moved in with Lee and his girlfriend Jade, 25, just over a month ago . 'It just happens that we have the same job and live together. 'Our girlfriends are quite understanding about it all really.

Benetton have again risked the fury of world leaders by unfurling a billboard ad in one of Israel's biggest cities showing its prime minister kissing his long-time enemy, the president of neighbouring Palestine. The high-impact image of Benjamin Netanyahu and Mahmoud Abbas puckering up is part of the Italian clothing label's controversial advertising campaign, Unhate, which was launched less than a fortnight ago. It has already received plenty of . attention, but the installation of one of the series' most provocative . images in Tel Aviv may cause an even stronger reaction. Political pout: Workers unfurl a billboard ad in Tel Aviv showing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu kissing Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas . Friendly: The doctored image in the Benetton advert is likely to upset many people in the Israeli city . The doctored photographs have already . caused outrage across the world, with the Vatican insisting the . 'disrespectful' picture of the Pope kissing an Egyptian imam was . withdrawn from the campaign. Now the politically daring fashion firm are . displaying their forthright message of acceptance on a giant billboard . in the heart of a country long troubled by its difficult relations with . Palestine. The move follows Benetton's . humiliating climbdown on the day of the launch when the company was . forced to pull one of its images. The Italian firm withdrew the . photograph featuring Pope Benedict XVI kissing a senior Egyptian imam on . the lips after the Vatican denounced it as unacceptable. Controversial: This mocked-up image of the Pope embracing Ahmed Mohamed el-Tayeb as part of Benetton's new advertising campaign has been called 'totally unacceptable' by the Vatican . Edgy: Benetton's Unhate Campaign includes this picture of U.S. President Barack Obama and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez kissing . Mocked-up: Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel in a clinch with French president Nicolas Sarkozy . Benetton . had claimed the campaign was aimed . at fostering tolerance and 'global love', but would have known how much . trouble they were likely to stir up. The digitally altered pictures . include U.S. President Barack Obama kissing Venezuela's socialist leader . Hugo Chavez and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il locking lips with South . Korean President Lee Myung-bak. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and . French president Nicolas Sarkozy also take time out from dealing with . the financial crisis engulfing Europe to give each other a smacker. But it is the shot of His Holiness . planting a kiss on Sheik Ahmed el-Tayeb of Cairo's al-Azhar institute, . the pre-eminent theological school of Sunni Islam, that raised the . strongest objections. It pulled from Benetton's website on the day of the launch about an hour after the Vatican's protest. Combating hatred: Benetton hope the controversial images will help create tolerance around the world. This picture shows China's leader Hu Jintao and Barack Obama . Enemies: North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and Lee Myung-bak, President of South Korea, are unlikely to be keen on this picture . Al-Azhar suspended interfaith talks . with the Vatican earlier this year after Benedict called for greater . protections for Egypt's minority Christians. Images were unfurled in Milan, New York, Paris, Tel Aviv and Rome, but a large banner of the image has been removed from a spot near the Vatican. Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico . Lombardi called the ad an 'unacceptable' manipulation of the pope's . likeness that offended the religious sentiments of the faithful. 'It shows a serious lack of respect for the Pope,' Lombardi said. Shock ads have long been a part of . Benetton's publicity strategy, with photographer Oliviero Toscani's . famous campaigns featuring death row inmates and people dying of AIDS. Attention: People look at a Benetton clothing store window in Paris which is covered by posters as part of its new provocative campaign . Benetton said the photographs of . political and religious leaders kissing were 'symbolic images of . reconciliation - with a touch of ironic hope and constructive . provocation - to stimulate reflection on how politics, faith and ideas, . when they are divergent and mutually opposed, must still lead to . dialogue and mediation.' In a statement, the Treviso-based manufacturer said: 'We are sorry that the use of an image of . the pontiff and the imam should have offended the sensibilities of the . faithful in this way. We have decided with immediate effect to withdraw . this image from every publication.' According to the Wall Street Journal, .

Forty fish have died in the cold after a council stored them in an old skip during repair work to a pond. Brighton and Hove City Council transferred the fish to a temporary home inside a rubbish skip, but the water was not kept fresh enough. The RSPCA said it had warned the council to move the . fish to a more suitable container after finding them stored in skips. The RSPCA has criticised the council for not providing adequate alternative storage . Up to 1000 fish had been stored in an old skip while the pond was prepared . There were coy carp, goldfish and perch being stored in the skips in the cold weather . The council is now working with the RSPCA to 'learn valuable lessons for the future'. The fish were among about 1,000 which lived in Brighton's Preston Park pond. Strategic Director for Brighton & Hove City Council, Geoff Raw, said: 'This is a very regrettable situation. 'Unfortunately we have lost some fish in the course of the urgent repair works to the park and pond - around 40. 'We thought we had made good plans and preparations for temporarily storing the fish on-site in specially-insulated skips which were specifically chosen as they are hard to vandalise. Brighton and Hove City Council was administering repair works to the pond when the fish died . 'However freezing weather meant we couldn't refresh the water regularly without causing an ice hazard on the path and cycle track nearby. 'We have been in contact with the RSPCA, to review what happened and have learnt some valuable lessons for the future. 'Staff are very upset as they are keen conservationists and would never have wanted this.' At the beginning of January the pond began undergoing repairs for the first time in two decades. It was being drained after springing a leak. It is believed that when the temperature dropped the water in the skips . was not being oxygenated which led to several fish perishing. An RSPCA spokesman said: 'The RSPCA was called by a concerned member of the public who had seen dead fish floating in the skips. 'We contacted the council and told them that they were not providing a suitable environment for the fish and arrangements were made to move the remaining fish to a nearby facility with ponds. 'We did not have enough evidence to prosecute the council but are assisting them with their inquiries into what went wrong.'

Hundreds of revellers gathered to give Grand National champion Neptune Collonges a hero's welcome as he returned to his home village today. Villagers in Ditcheat in Somerset lined the sides of the road and burst into spontaneous applause as the grey champion came into view. Neptune Collonges snatched a photo-finish victory at Aintree yesterday with jockey Daryl Jacob. Hero's welcome: Neptune Collonges and trainer Paul Nicholls (right) walk down the street during the victory parade in Ditcheat . On his return home he was triumphantly taken on several tours around the small village and was met by at least 300 hundred people waiting to greet the winning team as they arrived outside The Manor House Inn village pub. Landlord Simon D’Offay said the pub had been the hub of celebrations since yesterday’s triumph. ‘We must have sold between 40 and 50 bottles of champagne last night alone,’ he said. ‘I have been here three years and this is the busiest that I have ever seen it.’ Once the celebrations have died down, Neptune Collonges can look forward to a quieter life, as those who look after him have admitted the world’s most famous steeplechase on Merseyside would be the last race for him. Head Lad Clifford Baker, who has tended to the horse for many years, told Sky News, ‘He is basically retired now so he won’t race again. He deserves his break – I am pleased for him.’ Triumphant: Neptune Collonges with (from left) jockey Daryl Jacob, owner John Hales and trainer Paul Nicholls, who is holding the winner's trophy during the parade in Ditcheat .

Champions: Head Lad Clifford Baker parades Neptune Collonges through the village . ‘It’s terrible, he was a family pet, part of the family,’ he said. ‘Everybody’s absolutely upset. We’ve had loads of people knocking on the door. We’ve had loads of telephone calls and flowers given and bottles of wine. But all of that doesn’t bring him back, does it?’ The deaths of According To Pete and Synchronised bring the number of horses killed at the Grand National in the past 50 years to 36. Including Saturday’s deaths, 41 horses have been killed on UK racecourses this year.

Photo finish: Neptune Collonges ridden by Daryl Jacob jumps the water jump on its way to winnign the Grand National at Aintree Racecourse yesterday . ‘There is nothing sporting about an event that routinely kills so many horses.

Smuggled alcohol costs the taxman more than £1billion a year - but no more than six criminals are prosecuted every year, MPs said last night. Customs officials were lambasted last night for its lax enforcement regime which means just 20 people have been convicted for dodging alcohol tax over four years. The failure by HM Revenue and Customs to take effective action against criminal gangs means the Treasury loses out to the tune of £1.2billion a year. A raid on a warehouse in Hackney, East London, in 2010, uncovered 33,000 litres of pure alcohol in containers and bottles, pictured. Those behidn the operation paid no excise duty or VAT . MPs on the powerful Public Accounts Committee said the department did not have good enough information about how effective it was at tackling the problem and failed to make the best use of intelligence and technology to detect and prevent evasion. And the criticised the HMRC for having no idea about the extent of the tax gap for wine - making it impossible to target enforcement action against wine. MPs said they had been told criminals often export duty unpaid alcohol then redirect it back to the UK to sell. The report revealed that between 2006/07 and 2009/10, the highest number of successful prosecutions in any one year was six, and the highest number of defendants was 16. This illegal distillery discovered in Hackney in 2010, costi the taxman £10 million in lost revenue . It concluded that the HMRC does not . take enough account of the deterrent effect of successful prosecutions . when considering the cost and benefits of pursuing perpetrators through . the courts. Richard . Bacon, an MP on the committee, said: 'HMRC's drive to tackle alcohol . duty evasion is being seriously hampered by a lack of information. MP Richard Bacon, who sits on the Public Accounts Committee, criticised HMRC for its lack of information regarding alcohol duty evasion . 'Alcohol fraud is big business. The department estimates that the gap between taxes due on alcohol and the amount actually collected might be as large as £1.2billion. 'The department does not, however, . have enough reliable information on the returns from tackling different . types of alcohol duty evasion. 'It . cannot say, therefore, whether a more effective targeting of its . resources might not secure a better return on its investment. 'It . is unacceptable that the department has still to produce an estimate of . the tax gap for wine, despite a commitment to this committee's . predecessors to do so. 'The . absence of information on the scale and nature of wine duty fraud . undermines the basis on which the department directs its resources to . tackling the problem.' He added: 'Since the criminal gangs who . perpetrate major alcohol duty fraud operate across national boundaries, . the department needs to strengthen its intelligence by developing better . links with the industry, the UK Border Force and other EU member . states. 'The department seems to be reluctant to . prosecute offenders. Over a recent four year period, there were . successful prosecutions in no more than six cases a year. Criminals who dodge alcohol tax cost the taxman £1.2billion a year. File picture .

Not as glamorous as flame-haired foreign intelligence agent Anna Chapman, mice are nevertheless seen as fast and versatile in underground operations, say experts. They are potentially superior to dogs in detecting explosives and ammunition as well as seeking out human hostages, it is claimed. Military mouse: Russian intelligence say mice could be better than dogs at detecting explosives . Sources in Moscow say mice have been used already by the Israeli military in counter terrorist situations. If they pass a series of exacting tests at a secret location, the creatures could be deployed not only by GRU military intelligence but also other Russian secret services better known for honeytraps than mousetraps, reported Izvestia newspaper. 'Mice can be taught to detect the smell of certain substances,' explained Russian expert Anton Venediktov. 'Feeling it, they run to a special place in their cage, and make a certain pose. Russia's Anna Chapman captured the world's attention when she was deported from the U.s. accused of being a spy . 'Mice can be trained to signal, in particular, the smell of weapons, explosives, drugs, or the human body.' Mice - like Tom’s sparring partner Jerry and also Mickey Mouse - have been eulogised for years in cartoons, often portrayed as shrewder than other animals. This is with good reason, said Venediktov, from specialist technical and security centre EVRAAS in Moscow. They have a 'less complicated central nervous system' than some other animals. This means they are not so prone to mood swings and emotional stress. Their behaviour is 'more stable', making them ideal for 007-style roles, it is claimed. They can be trained to perform 150 tasks in one month such as sniffing out explosives or weapons, and can work shifts of between six and eight hours, it is claimed.","Sources in Moscow say mice have been used already by the Israeli military .

Paul Swangard, managing director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of Oregon's business school, was quoted by The Huffington Post saying: ‘It appears to be a charitable gift that is trying to be a marketing vehicle, and it just doesn't make a lot of sense. ‘To link themselves with an athletic department when their business is locking people up, it just doesn't connect to me really well.’ Critics of the private prison industry argue that the company is trying to win favour with public officials who hand out contracts. Bob Libal, from Grassroots Leadership, a . criminal justice advocacy group, said GEO Group relied on public . dollars for all its profits. Sponsor: The university announced their partnership GEO Group Inc, which runs 101 correctional, detention and community re-entry facilities with about 73,000 beds, raising questions about the suitability of the match . He said: ‘When you look at other things that GEO gives to, it's generally in communities where they either have contracts or are seeking contracts, and certainly Florida is a state where GEO has tremendous interest.’ GEO Group manages correctional, detention and community re-entry facilities on behalf of federal, state and local government agencies and employs more than 18,000 staff. The Boca Raton, Florida-based company’s revenue has almost tripled in the last ten years as their share of inmate populations increased. They also have contracts to detain hundreds of thousands of immigrants caught by the federal government. GEO Group’s chief executive, George Zoley, attended Florida Atlantic University, completing bachelors and masters degrees and had also been on the board of trustees. Pablo Paez, a spokesman for the company said the donation was ‘consistent with the GEO Group Foundation's commitment to fund educational causes and scholarships’.","Florida Atlantic University's football stadium will be named after sponsor GEO Group Inc .

UPDATED: . 02:39 EST, 20 February 2013 . Officers followed the tracks left by drunken former soldier Lewis Ward, 28, from the home where he snuck in and grabbed an iPad to his home in Darlington . A  burglar who led police from the scene of the break-in to his front door with a trail of footprints in the snow escaped jail today. Officers followed the tracks left by drunken former soldier Lewis Ward, 28, from the home where he snuck in and grabbed an iPad to his home in Raby Street, Darlington. He was arrested just 90 minutes after he walked in through his victim’s unlocked front door at 11.30pm on January 18. He stole the iPad from a woman who was alone and waiting for her partner to come home from work. She had been getting changed upstairs and when she spotted fresh snow on the living room carpet and saw her boyfriend had not returned, she realised there had been a break-in, Darlington Magistrates’ Court heard. Officers spotted a distinctive footprint in the snow by her front door and followed the tracks down alleyways and back lanes. Unemployed Ward, who suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and left the Army in 2007, made an immediate confession and showed police where he had hidden the tablet behind his wardrobe, the court heard. Jonathan Harley, defending, said: 'This is about the least planned burglary you are likely to see.' He said it was an 'impulsive'  and 'silly act' which his client could neither remember nor explain. He had got drunk following a row with his girlfriend, with whom he had a two-month old baby. Chairman of the bench Rajeev Devgan said the offence was serious with the aggravating feature of the break-in happening when the victim was at home, alone. Ward was handed a 26-week jail sentence, suspended for a year, with an order to carry out 240 hours unpaid work and was subjected to a weekend night-time curfew. He must also pay £85 costs and a £80 victim surcharge from his benefits. Mr Devgan said: 'This is an opportunity for you to put things right.' Ward left court with a woolly hat pulled down tight on his head.","Officers followed the tracks left by drunken former soldier Lewis Ward, 28 from the house he snuck into, back to his home .

Another 464 jobs face the axe at failed music chain HMV after administrators announced the closure of a further 37 stores. Deloitte said the stores would close over the next four to six weeks and would probably lead to all affected staff being made redundant, although it would try to relocate employees to other stores where possible. The blow will leave around 116 stores in the HMV chain, after Deloitte said 66 stores would close earlier this month, affecting nearly 1,000 staff. Cuts: Once-mighty retail chain HMV will close a further 37 stores over the next six weeks, leaving nearly 500 staff without jobs. It is the second major round of store closures . The store closures come after 60 staff were let go by Deloitte across HMV’s head office network at Eastcastle Street in London, Marlow and Solihull nearly two weeks ago - including former HMV boss Trevor Moore. Around 190 jobs had previously been cut by Deloitte in the chain’s head offices and distribution centres. Nick Edwards, joint administrator at Deloitte, said the decision to shut the stores was made to 'enhance the prospects of the restructured business continuing as a going concern'. HMV chief executive Trevor Moore was made redundant just weeks after saying he was 'convinced' the chain's future could be secured . He added: 'We are extremely grateful to the staff for their continued strong support and commitment during an understandably difficult period. 'All other key stakeholders including suppliers and landlords remain supportive and we appreciate their ongoing assistance.' HMV collapsed into administration last month, but Deloitte said last week that sale discussions were 'progressing' as it also announced it had secured stock from most of its suppliers that will see it continue to sell the latest blockbusters and music releases. It said trading agreements had been put in place so stock could be replenished and it will be able to sell new hits, including the latest James Bond film Skyfall. Restructuring firm Hilco - the group behind HMV Canada - has already bought the company’s debt in a move that has raised hopes of a rescue deal. HMV had more than 220 stores and 4,120 staff when it hit the wall in January after failing to keep pace with internet rivals and supermarkets, whose scale has enabled them to offer CDs and DVDs at cheaper prices. Earlier this month HMV boss Trevor Moore was one of 60 staff let go by administrators Deloitte across HMV's head office network at Eastcastle Street in London, Marlow and Solihull. HMV struggled to keep pacewith online retailers and supermarkets . Historic carpet maker Axminster is to go into administration in a move putting 400 jobs at risk. The Devon-based company, which dates . back 250 years, said the decision will provide the company and its . creditors with time to explore various rescue options. Director Joshua Dutfield said: .

"By . Jaymi Mccann . PUBLISHED: . 16:35 EST, 20 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:29 EST, 21 February 2013 . Jane Jackson has been struck off after she was caught half naked with an inmate in locked room . A nurse who romped half naked with an inmate at a maximum security jail was struck off today. Jane Jackson was caught topless in a private treatment room with a male prisoner at HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes, Bucks. The category A prison, once dubbed 'Britain's Alcatraz', houses some of the country's most dangerous criminals including rapists, murderers and terrorists. Jackson jammed a mop under the door of the treatment room and stripped off in front of the inmate, referred to as Prisoner A. The Nursing and Midwifery Council panel had ruled the blonde nurse had an inappropriate and sexually motivated relationship with the man. Jackson's fitness to practice was found to be impaired by reason of misconduct and she was struck off. Paul Morris, chairing the hearing, said: 'It is clear Miss Jackson has not provided a high standard of practice at all times, acted with integrity or upheld the reputation of the profession. 'She failed to establish and maintain professional boundaries with prisoner A and she was in breach of her obligations which amounted to serious professional misconduct. 'Her flagrant disregard of policy seriously undermines the risk of security, not only to herself and colleagues but the security of the entire prison. 'Her misconduct carried an unwarranted risk of arm and bought the profession into disrepute.' Jackson was caught out on February 7, 2009, when prison guard Rebecca Langley burst into the treatment room during her tryst with Prisoner A. 'Her top half was naked, and she was holding her bra and staff tunic in her hand,' said Barry Dooley, for the NMC. 'As the registrant dressed, Ms Langley asked how she had locked the door, and the registrant replied that this is how we always do it, by wedging the mop against the door.' A sobbing Jackson was taken straight to the prison governor's office and suspended before being frogmarched off the premises. She admitted breaking strict regulations by being alone with Prisoner A and taking off her clothes. But she claimed it was a one-off, and said she had been pressured into it by the inmate, fearing for her life. 'He said 'let me into the treatment room' he had this horrible look on his face'. 'I just froze and panicked, then opened the door.' 'She added that she opened the door ""like a robot"", adding that Prisoner A ""had the remote control, thats how I felt""' HMP Woodhill is one of the country's maximum security prisons, housing inmates that have committed the most serious crimes . But Mr Dooley told the hearing: 'If she was so scared and feared for her life, why would she open a locked door and go in with him simply on the basis of a look? 'She did not call out for help at any stage although she knew there were police officers nearby, she even admitted she had put the mop across the door for privacy.' Jackson had previously said 'I had strong feelings for him, I knew deep down that I was a professional and he was a prisoner.' She threw her keys to the prison doors on a chair during her romp with the prisoner, putting the security of the jail at risk, the hearing was told. 'Being in a confined space with a prisoner means that you have potentially put at risk the security of the establishment', said Hannah Pugliesie, a senior manager with Milton Keynes Primary Care Trust which provides medical care at the jail. 'You could be held hostage, you could be at risk in that particular environment.' Jackson had already confessed to breaching strict security by smuggling Lynx deodorant and Radox shower gel into the jail for the prisoner in January 2009. 'Very stupidly I brought toiletries in just to shut him up,' Jackson said. 'It was absolutely wrong but I did it.' The contraband items were found in his cell following Jackson's suspension, adding weight to the NMC's case that Jackson was in a relationship with Prisoner A. He worked in the prison laundry along the corridor from Jackson's office, and would regularly chat to the nurse on his way back to the cells. She also denied two drugs cabinets in her treatment room were open during her tryst with prisoner A, a claim that was rejected by the panel. Jackson was fired by the health trust on July 9, 2009, following an internal investigation.","Jane Jackson was caught with the inmate at HMP Woodhill, Milton Keynes .

Scott Nicholls was speeding when he smashed into Emma Harold, 26, her younger sister Beccy Rutter, 25, and their friend Kate Wasyluk, 25 . A drunk driver who killed two best friends when he ploughed into them four years ago is set to be freed after serving just one month in prison. Scott Nicholls, then 20, was speeding and was over the alcohol limit with traces of heroin and ecstasy in his system when he caused the late-night horror crash. Nicholls smashed into Emma Harold, 26, her younger sister Beccy Rutter, 25, and their friend Kate Wasyluk, 25. The three young women were mown down . just yards from the entrance of St Clement's Hospital in Ipswich, . Suffolk, in the early hours of February 21, 2009. Miss Harold and Miss Wasyluk were tragically killed while Miss Rutter suffered horrific injuries. Nicholls, of Ipswich, was detained under the mental health act at his trial at Ipswich Crown Court in September 2009. His 12-year sentence was slashed by a . third to eight years, taking into account his guilty plea to a charge . of causing death by dangerous driving. The killer driver has spent the last four years in a mental health hospital and was released into prison in January. As well as having to cope with the . fourth anniversary of losing Miss Harold and Miss Wasyluk today, their devastated . families have been told Nicholls will be released by the end of this . month. They are now waiting for the call . from the probation service to confirm when he will walk out of the . prison gates into a new life of freedom. Today, furious Remy Wasyluk, 31, the brother of Miss Wasyluk, has called for a change in the law. He is demanding that criminals deemed unfit to serve in prison should be treated in hospital and then sent to jail to start their sentence. Echoing Mr Wasyluk's anger, survivor of the horrific crash Miss Rutter, of Ipswich, said she was very 'cross' that Nicholls has 'got off lightly with a lesser sentence'. Mr Wasyluk, of central London, said: 'We have been told he (Nicholls) will be released at the end of February, we don't know the exact date. 'I hope they (the justice system) wouldn't be so ridiculously insensitive as to release him on the same day as the anniversary.' Tragic: Kate Wasyluk, 25, relaxing with her mother Dot Richardson . Recovering: Emma Harold's younger sister Beccy Rutter (right), 25, pictured after the crash . Kate Wasyluk's Dot Richardson poses by her shrine to her tragic daughter . He added: 'It is very distressing for . all the families, hearing this news as we all have to cope with the . fourth anniversary. What makes it worse is he has only served just over . one month in prison.' Miss . Rutter, now 29, said: 'As a family we do try not to think too much about . him (Nicholls), but knowing he has only served one month in prison, for . taking two lives, makes me so cross. 'It feels like he has got off with a lesser sentence. 'Whether . he was sentenced to eight or 20 years, he would be out one day with the . opportunity of a second chance ' a second chance Emma and Kate will . never have.' Mr Wasyluk . added: 'The law needs to be changed. If someone is detained in hospital, . deemed too ill to go to prison, they should be treated and brought to a . position where they are aware of what has happened, and what they have . done. 'Then and only then should they be . sent to prison to serve their sentence. In this case, he would have . served a total of eight years, which is what he was ultimately sentenced . to. Miss Wasyluk's devastated . family has been told Nicholls will be released by the end of this . month . 'It seems only yesterday this all happened and now we are four years on and he has served just one month in prison. 'Four years in prison, we could have accepted whatever we felt about the length of sentence, but one month seems unjust.' He hit out as tragic Miss Wasyluk's mother, Dot Richardson, 58, told Nicholls to make the most of his new-found liberty. Mrs Richardson, of Ipswich, said: 'This year has been the worst. I tend to bury my head in the sand and don't really think about him (Nicholls), I'm not really interested in what happens to him whatsoever.' But she stressed: 'Having said that, it is a small town and you do hear things. It is extremely hard, it shouldn't be any different to any other year, but it is. The biggest insult for me would be if he came out and reoffended. 'This is his second chance ' I want him to take it. He is lucky to have it and must make the most of it. My friends tell me I have forgiven him and, although I can't say the words out loud, I think in my heart I have.' Honouring the memory of her older sister and friend, Miss Rutter said she could think of no more fitting tribute than to give her new baby girl their names. Azariah Emma Kate Rutter was born on January 28. Miss Rutter said she and her husband Liam were desperate to keep their memories alive. The devastated mother-of-three said: 'Emma was my sister and Kate one of my best friends, I loved them both like sisters. 'I wanted to do something to keep their memories alive and keep them with me at all times. 'Azariah will never get to meet her auntie or my friend and so I hope with her having their names she will feel a connection with them both.' She added: 'It was hard, I was worried about having her so close to the anniversary. She is doing really well, settling in at home. She is just gorgeous.' Miss Wasyluk's mother Dot said that when she heard Miss Rutter had poignantly honoured her daughter she was moved to tears. 'It blew me away. I knew she had given birth to another daughter and was keeping the name under wraps,' she said. 'I was expecting her to name Azariah after Emma but for her to honour Kate as well was amazing. Kate would've just loved it - it is a lovely way to remember them both.'","Scott Nicholls, then 20, mowed down three women in Suffolk .

"Tropicana Casino and Resort was sold same year out of bankruptcy . court . By . Nick Enoch . PUBLISHED: . 11:20 EST, 20 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:30 EST, 20 February 2013 . Atlantic City's newest casino - which opened less than a year ago - is filing for bankruptcy, it was announced today. Revel, the casino that many people had hoped . would turn around the New Jersey city's flagging fortunes, said it . will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March. The $2.4billion . enterprise never caught on as much as expected, and it languished near the bottom of Atlantic City's 12 casinos in terms of revenue. Revel, the casino that many people had hoped would turn around Atlantic City's flagging fortunes, said it will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March . Kevin DeSanctis, CEO of Revel Entertainment, and his wife, Donna, greet employees moments before the new $2.4billion casino resort opened in New Jersey last February . The voluntary, prepackaged bankruptcy . envisioned for late March will wipe away about two-thirds of its $1.5billion in debt by converting more than $1billion of it into equity for . lenders. Kevin DeSanctis, Revel's CEO, said the restructuring will give the casino resort more flexibility to operate. 'Today's . announcement is a positive step for Revel,' he said. 'The . agreement we have reached with our lenders will ensure that the hundreds . of thousands of guests who visit Revel every year will continue to . enjoy a signature Revel experience in our world-class facility.' Existing . management will remain in place, no layoffs are planned, and employees . and vendors will be paid as usual, according to the company. The downfall of Revel is just the latest in a . series of recent bankruptcies involving Atlantic City casinos. Trump . Entertainment Resorts emerged in 2010 from the third Chapter 11 . bankruptcy that it or its corporate predecessors had filed. And the . Tropicana Casino and Resort was sold that same year out of bankruptcy . court to billionaire Carl Icahn. The restructuring . should be completed by early summer, it added. Revel had to line up two rounds of additional financing since . August to keep operating. In January, it posted its second-worst . month, winning less than $8million from gamblers. During the second and . third quarters of last year, it reported gross operating losses of $35million and $37million. Revel's work force is largely non-union - a . fact that earned it the undying enmity of Local 54 of the Unite-HERE . union, representing most of the city's casino workers. 'Over three . years ago, Local 54 began expressing to every elected official in the . city, the state and the governor's office that this project was doomed . to failure,' said Bob McDevitt, the union's president. 'Had they . listened to us three years ago, we would not have this catastrophe on . our hands now.' Michael Drewniak, Governor Chris Christie's press secretary, expressed confidence in Revel. He said: 'We . are committed to the resurgence of Atlantic City, the tourism district, . and the many efforts currently under way to bring world-class . attractions and entertainment to the city,' he said. 'A rejuvenated . Revel will remain an integral part of that landscape, as it continues . full operations as a premiere hotel, gaming and top-flight entertainment . hub for the city, in addition to employing more than 2,000 people. An Atlantic City worker vacuums the Boardwalk near the Revel casino - but the entertainment group has failed to hoover up profits . 'Most . importantly, none of those things that make Revel among Atlantic City's . highest-profile attractions will change, as Revel uses this new . financial flexibility and the continued backing of its investors to grow . the business and be part of Atlantic City's expansion.' David Rebuck, director of the state Division of Gaming Enforcement, said the Chapter 11 filing needs to happen. 'The . agreement between Revel and its lenders will allow for a necessary . financial restructuring and improve the property's financial condition . going forward,' he said. 'We see this as a positive step that will allow . Revel to comprehensively address its financial needs while continuing . normal business operations.' Revel officials have been reviewing . their options in recent months as the Atlantic City market continued to . decline and its own revenues remained stuck in neutral. DeSanctis said . the company and its lenders decided that a prepackaged Chapter 11 would . be the best way to improve its balance sheet by eliminating substantial . debt and increasing the changes for growth. As part of the restructuring, . some of Revel's lenders will provide approximately $250million in . debtor-in-possession financing, about $45million of which constitutes . new money commitments and approximately $205million of which is . pre-petition debt. No taxpayer funds will be used to finance the . restructuring, the casino said. The company didn't identify which lenders will be part of the filing; it said only that 'a majority' of its lenders have agreed. Revel . opened in April as a potential game-changer - the first new casino built . in Atlantic City since the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa opened in . 2003. Revel was designed as a destination resort, an ambitious, . risky project in a declining market. It saw itself not as a casino . resort but as a resort that happened to have a casino. But the . distinction seemed to have been lost on many customers, who found its . restaurants and hotel rooms pricey. The project had to overcome . numerous obstacles before its opening. Three key executives working on . the project died in a Minnesota plane crash in July 2008; a worker . pouring concrete was struck by lightning and killed in 2011. The . project ran out of money during the recession and had to stop . construction halfway through. Morgan Stanley pulled out, taking a $1.2billion loss on the project. It only got completed with the help of . state tax incentives that were approved in February 2011.","It is third recent casualty in the New Jersey city .

Freezeframe Instant Lash: Scientists in Australia have invented 'instant lash extensions' which double the length of eyelashes in seconds, they claim . They are the must-have make-up accessory of WAGS and young women everywhere. But for those who yearn for long, luscious eye-lashes, without the hassle of applying false ones, a new mascara may be about to revolutionise eye make-up for ever. Scientists in Australia have come up with a treatment which claims to double the length of eye-lashes in seconds. Made up of a combination of tiny . synthetic hairs, contained in a thick gel base, users brush on . Freezeframe Instant Lash with a mascara wand, depositing the small hairs . on to the tips of their eye-lashes. The . more times the treatment is applied, the more hairs are deposited, . giving the wearer natural looking lash extensions up to a third of an . inch longer. The gel base . holds the tiny hairs in place, but can also help stiffen lashes, so they . can be ‘curled up’, giving the wearer a pretty ‘open-eyed’ look. Unlike traditional mascara, Instant Lash is applied to just the tips of lashes, not from the base. Users are able to apply their usual coloured mascara on top. It can be used by contact lens’ wearers and is removed like other eye products, with cleanser or soap and water. Instant . Lash has become the number one selling lash product in Australia and . there is already a 7,000-strong waiting list for the 10ml bottles when . it goes on sale on the British High Street for the first time next . month. Skin care expert, Sonia Amoroso, who developed the £29 formula, said: ‘It is my personal passion to make the most cutting edge, scientific breakthroughs in easy to use formulations, at accessible prices. ‘Freezeframe Instant Lash has been a huge hit with customers who say this lash treatment creates visibly instant, longer, luscious lashes in seconds.’ Tricky business: Applying false eyelashes is a tricky business. The new product, which looks like mascara, has become the number-one selling eyelash product in Australia . One customer, Sylvia Brown, 60, of Nottingham, said she started using Instant Lash because her eye-lashes were getting ‘sparser’ as she got older. ‘I’m not a fan of fake eyelashes and couldn’t bear the thought of going to a salon for extensions,’ she said. ‘ I read rave reviews about Instant Lash on the Internet and thought I’d buy some.

But when the animals are contained in a zoo enclosure and you are firing down on them from behind a safety barrier - it is a little easier to be brave. These lions certainly looked less than pleased when they were pelted with snow by laughing visitors, including children, at Hangzhou Zoo in Zhejiang Province, eastern China. Helpless: The two lions cowered together as snow was hurled down into their enclosure by the crowd above at Hangzhou Zoo in Zhejiang Province, eastern China . Bullying: A group of visitors - some just children - bombarded the lions with snow from the side of the pen . Frightened: The lioness, clearly scared, ducks down as snowballs fly past her . The attack was reportedly launched by one young man, who began to take aim at the big cats with a barrage of snow and ice. The attack clearly frightened the helpless animals, with the lioness swiftly taking cover under a wooden plank. The male line used a tree trunk as cover, with both eyes fixed on the visitors, as the missiles rained into the enclosure, ChinaSmack.com reports. The man apparently laughed as he hurled the snow, with a group of other visitors, including a number of children, also starting to take aim at the lions.

The frightened lions took shelter together in the corner of their pen as they tried to escape the new onslaught. The male lion roared in anger at his tormentors as they began to stroll away.

Tax evasion: Donna Asutaitis was jailed for 16 months after making £300,000 in just two years by working as a prostitute for wealth businessmen . A £1,000-a-night call girl was jailed for tax evasion yesterday after making £300,000 in just two years selling herself to wealthy businessmen. Donna Asutaitis, 29, said she turned to prostitution when she was a penniless student. The ‘self-employed escort’ went on to study for a master’s degree but was able to buy a flat in London’s Knightsbridge, putting down a £110,000 deposit in cash. She was caught when police found huge amounts of cash in her possession and realised she had not paid income tax of £120,000 on it. Investigators believe Asutaitis was earning around £3,000 a week on average, and charging up to £1,000 a night. Yesterday she tottered into Southwark Crown Court on her high heels, wearing a tight black miniskirt and jacket and a striped blouse with her dark hair dyed blonde. She wept as the court was told that her parents, council worker Stan, 52, and Susan, 51, learned of her secret double life as a prostitute after the police began their case against her. Prosecutor Charlotte Newell had told the court that concrete facts and figures were hard to come by, ‘given the nature of the employment she was engaged in’. But he said Asutaitis bought her luxury flat for £360,000 in March 2007. When police raided it later that year, they seized £72,000 in cash, along with expensive jewellery given to her by clients. In a second raid in 2010 they found £8,350 in cash in her flat and another £50,000 in a safe deposit box. Another prosecutor, Jonathan Polnay, told the court: ‘This defendant was working for years as an escort and in that job she received significant sums of money. ‘When she was arrested she read out a pre-prepared statement in which she said she had been a self-employed escort for about ten years, and that she was often paid in cash and received valuable jewellery in gifts.’ Prosecutors initially claimed that Asutaitis made £870,000 over five years and owed £315,000 in tax. But yesterday she successfully argued that her period of tax free earnings lasted just two years. Trial: Southwark Crown Court a police raid on Asutaits' home found £73,000 stashed in her flat and items of high value jewellery given to her by some of her clients . She was not charged with offences directly relating to the sex industry, because it is possible for a prostitute to operate within the law providing she works alone and in private premises. Asutaitis worked out of her luxury flat. But her financial affairs were a different matter, and she faced three charges relating to fraud and theft. She had denied one charge of money laundering £110,000 for alleged criminals Rizwan Chaudury and Raj Koi, and another of using deception to obtain her £250,000 mortgage from the Birmingham Midshires building society – she had pretended to a be a racehorse consultant. Those charges were left to lie on the file, but she admitted defrauding the taxman between April 2005 and January 2007, when she made more than £300,000 as an escort. Stan Reiz, defending, told the court that Asutaitis started work as an escort to fund her university education. ‘It is lamentable that any young woman should have to come to London and do this kind of work in order to support herself,’ he said. ‘Her family have been embarrassed by these proceedings, not only because of the offence but because they didn’t know she was working as an escort in the first place. The criminal offence was committed in naivety on her part, as she was only 22 when this started. Funding: Asutaits started working as a call-girl to pay for a masters degree at the University of Westminster . ‘Since this has been hanging over her, she has suffered from depression and insomnia and has taken illicit drugs, and has dropped out of her master’s degree.’ Jailing Asutaitis for 16 months, Judge Peter Testar said she had deliberately avoided paying tax. ‘The amount of tax which is subject to this charge which has been evaded is £120,000,’ he said. ‘In my judgment this was an offence that was fraudulent from the outset carried out over a significant period of time.’ In November the court will rule on how much Asutaitis must repay to the taxman – but the sum is likely to be covered by the £130,000 already seized from her. Last night her uncle, Michael Asutaitis, said at his home in Coventry that his niece had been a pupil at the Cardinal Wiseman Catholic school. ‘She was a good girl. I can’t speak for my brother, but I should think Stan would be very disappointed,’ he said. Last night Asutaitis’s parents declined to comment on their daughter’s plight from their smart four bed detached £250,000 home in Coventry.","Donna Asutaits, 29, started working as a call-girl to fund a masters degree at the University of Westminster .

Royal Bank of Scotland looks set for another row over pay for its casino banking staff following a year of shame for the company. The bank, which is more than 80 per cent owned by the taxpayer, is under pressure to claw back £4m in shares owed to John Hourican, the head of the investment bank. It is also thought that RBS is planning to pay bonuses worth £250m – an average of £21,000 for each of its 11,900 staff in the division, although so-called high-flyers will get far more. That would be well down on the £390m . it paid out for 2011 and £937m in 2010 but will still raise eyebrows in . the wake of a series of scandals to hit the bank. RBS (down 22p at 345.8p) is likely to . be hit with a fine worth around £500m over its involvement in the Libor . rate-rigging scandal – possibly as early as this week. The share price fell yesterday after reports that criminal charges could be brought against the bank. It is also facing a rising bill for its part in the mis-selling of payment protection insurance having already set aside £1.7bn. And it has coughed up £175m following a . computer meltdown last summer which caused havoc for millions of . customers at its NatWest, RBS and Ulster Bank branches. Former business secretary Pat McFadden said today that bankers should pay all of the Libor fine. Threatened: RBS is likely to be hit with a fine worth around £500m over its involvement in the Libor rate-rigging scandal - possibly as early as this week . ‘There would be enormous anger if . taxpayers had to foot the bill for the sins of RBS,’ he said. ‘If they . are fined they should take it out of the bonus pool rather than the . bank’s general resources.’ Unite chief Dominic Hook added: ‘It . looks like ordinary bank workers and taxpayers will pay the price for . the greed at the top of RBS. It is time (Chancellor) George Osborne put his foot . down.’ Sacrifice: CEO Stephen Hester has waived his bonus for three of the past four years . RBS chief . executive Stephen Hester agreed to waive his bonus for 2012 in the wake . of the IT glitch. He could have got £2.4m on top of his £1.2m salary but . has now waived his bonus in three of the past four years since taking . over at the bank after its £45bn bailout by the taxpayer. But Whitehall officials are now pressuring RBS to claw back a deferred share package worth £4m owed to Hourican. He is expected to leave the company shortly as part of a restructuring of the investment banking arm. But his departure could also be part . of an attempt to draw a line under the Libor scandal – even though the . settlement with US and UK regulators is not likely to implicate any . senior figures.

An RBS source also said that no . decision has been made on bonus payments as yet - but a £250m pot would . represent another fall and is well below what rivals earn at other . banks.

Shamed: Chris Huhne, pictured yesterday, bought an iPad on his expenses just before he quit as an MP and was convicted of perverting the course of justice . Nick Clegg has signalled that Chris Huhne should forfeit his £17,207 pay-off as it emerged the former Cabinet Minister put a £600 iPad on expenses just days before he quit as an MP on Monday. Mr Huhne was handed the pay-off when he left the Cabinet last year. It is the equivalent of three months’ of a Cabinet Minister’s £68,827 annual salary. He received this on top of his MP’s salary of £65,738. It also emerged yesterday Huhne had acquired a top-of-the-range Apple tablet at taxpayers’ expense just a fortnight before pleading guilty in court to asking his ex-wife to take his speeding points. After a public grilling on his weekly radio show, Mr Clegg made clear he sympathised with those who believed that multi-millionaire Huhne should ‘pay amends’. Mr Clegg told his LBC 97.3 radio phone-in show: ‘I totally understand why people think that now he has pleaded guilty and when he is sentenced that he should pay amends for what’s happened. ‘But at the end of the day Chris has got to make that decision. I don’t yet know what sentence the judge is going to hand down to him.’ Mr Clegg said he was not going to provide ‘a running commentary’ on Huhne’s fate. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman was also asked if Huhne should repay his settlement. He said: ‘This is a matter for Chris Huhne.’ Huhne – who stood down as the MP for Eastleigh this week – is also entitled to claim up to £53,150 for winding down his office. Most of this is for severance pay to staff. Under the rules of IPSA, the MPs’ expenses watchdog, Mr Huhne will be free to keep his iPad because it would be too costly to hire bailiffs to retrieve it. Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘The timing of this claim (for the iPad) appears utterly cynical. He can’t dodge the bill for this expensive gadget like he tried to dodge his speeding points.’ Expensive: Mr Huhne claimed a new £600 iPad and will not have to give it back despite his fall from grace . Westminster . was left shocked on Monday as after nearly two years proclaiming his . innocence and fighting to have the case dropped, Huhne changed his plea . at the start of his trial at Southwark Crown Court, promptly resigning . as Liberal Democrat MP for Eastleigh and ending his political career. His . ex-wife Vicky Pryce, who is in court on the same charge, only revealed . she had taken his speeding points to exact revenge on her cheating . husband and 'nail him' after he left her for another woman, the jury was . told. Mr Clegg will today call the by-election . in Huhne’s Eastleigh seat on February 28 – far earlier than expected – . amid Lib Dem jitters that it could fall to their coalition partners. Mr Clegg fired the starting gun on his campaign today . with a savage attack on the Conservatives over their failure to agree to . a mansion tax on expensive homes, while claiming sole credit for . cutting the income tax bill for more than 60,000 basic rate taxpayers in . Eastleigh. Criminal: Former energy secretary Chris Huhne, with his partner Carina Trimingham, whose affair sparked his ex-wife to seek revenge after taking his speeding points in 2003, her trial heard this week . He used the . major speech of the by-election contest to accuse the Tories of . demanding a tax cut for millionaires while he battled to cut tax bills . for low and middle earners. Mr Clegg revived the prospect of a mansion tax to target wealthy home owners. He said his 'preferred option' was a 1 per cent levy on properties worth more than £2million, applied just to the value over and above £2m. Alternatively he proposed new council tax bands at the 'top end' levied on properties worth over £2million. Mr Clegg said: 'Both of these options . are based on a very simple principle: That we should ask a small number . of very wealthy individuals to make a reasonable contribution, in order . to provide desperately needed help for millions of ordinary people. 'Nothing could do more to demonstrate . a commitment to greater fairness in our tax system. It’s an open secret . that our Conservative partners do not share our views on this. 'However, we will continue to make . this argument, in this Coalition and beyond.  Our approach is simple: . taxes on mansions; tax cuts for millions. An approach to tax that puts . payslips before palaces, if you like.' The Conservatives have . indicated that they intend to relentlessly highlight Huhne's record, who . quit the Commons on Monday after pleading . guilty to perverting the course of justice after years of denials. Rivalry: Huhne and Nick Clegg clashed during the 2007 leadership to succeed Sir Menzies Campbell . The by-election contest is likely to be one of the most hotly-contested in recent years, with two governing parties going head-to-head. Both Mr Clegg and David Cameron know that victory for their party would help settle complaints about their leadership, and defeat will raise serious doubts about their hopes at the 2015 general election. Lib Dems insisted their decision, as . the sitting party in the constituency, to opt for a short contest . reflected the high state of preparedness of the local party, even though . they have yet to choose a candidate. 'We are going to throw the kitchen sink at it. I'm pretty sure that the Conservatives will as well,' one source said. Speculation: It is thought Maria Hutchings may stand for the Conservatives in Chris Huhne's former seat . 'It is going to be a tight contest, and generally in tight contests in two-way marginals you get some pretty robust exchanges.' Meanwhile Conservative chairman Grant Shapps . told the Mail: ‘The residents of Eastleigh have for a long time been . sold a lie by their Lib Dem MP. That’s why they’ll welcome the . opportunity to express the way they feel about it very soon. ‘Conservatives will present the . opportunity to start afresh with a hard-working local MP who gets on . with looking after her constituents.’ It is understood that the Tories will formally select local mother Maria Hutchings, their candidate in . 2010, to fight the seat again. She famously confronted Tony Blair over cuts . to special schools in the 2005 election campaign. Her chances of success have been boosted by UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage’s decision not to stand. Labour sources are hoping for a strong showing, but are thought to privately accept they have little chances of winning. But Lib Dem chief whip Alistair . Carmichael will today move the writ to trigger a by-election in . Eastleigh in just over three weeks – before the party has even selected a . candidate. Former Lib Dem frontbencher Dr Evan . Harris, who fronts the Hacked Off campaign for a press law, last night . ruled himself out, as has Lib Dem council leader Keith House. A Tory victory in Eastleigh, which . would require a 3.5 per cent swing, would be a shattering blow for Mr . Clegg. No prime minister since Margaret Thatcher at the height of her . Falklands popularity has managed to gain a seat in a by-election. Trial: Vicky Pryce, the ex-wife of Chris Huhne, is in court over the same charge but denies it on the basis of 'marital coercion' Former Energy Secretary Huhne was . clocked driving too fast in March 2003 and persuaded Pryce to take the . blame so he could avoid losing his licence. The couple separated after 26 years . of marriage in 2010 after Mr Huhne admitted he was having an affair with . his PR adviser Carina Trimingham, 46. Driven . by a thirst for ‘revenge’, Mrs Pryce decided to leak the sensational . story that he forced her to take his speeding points to escape a driving . ban. In one email she wrote: ‘I really want to nail him. More than ever actually, and I would love to do it soon.’ Southwark Crown Court heard how Pryce hatched a plot with a journalist from the Sunday Times to ‘set up’ Huhne in a series of taped phone calls which were yesterday played to the jury. But the wary politician had refused to admit the offence in a series of heated exchanges which only served to illustrate the bitterness of the couple’s split. In one call, Huhne accuses his former wife of telling the papers that he has split up with the woman he left her for, his bisexual former press adviser Miss Trimingham. Pryce responds: ‘I’m very pleased for you that you are still with that man of yours.’ In another call she complains her home is under siege from journalists saying: ‘I can’t even get home, whether it’s to do with your ****ing man or whether it’s to do with your ****ing points.’ Huhne now faces prison  after a £150,000 prosecution and a £100,000 police investigation bill.

Stephen Lawrence’s brother is preparing to sue Scotland Yard for discrimination. Stuart Lawrence says patrol officers have pulled him over ‘loads of times’ during the past few years without proper justification. The final straw is said to have come when the teacher was stopped while driving through South-East London in November. Family: With his murdered elder brother Stephen . Sources said Mr Lawrence, 35, was left furious and deeply sceptical about the reasons police gave for wanting to question him. The father of one has instructed lawyers to lodge a formal complaint with Scotland Yard. This will include a detailed log he has kept of all the times he has been stopped. The move will send shock waves through the Metropolitan Police force, which in 1999 was accused of being institutionally racist by the inquiry into Stephen’s murder. Details of Stuart’s legal action emerged after his campaigning mother, Doreen, appeared on ITV News yesterday. She said: ‘Families up and down the country are still experiencing racism. My son has been stopped how many times, driving around in London. Racism is still very high. Stuart Lawrence, 35, is preparing to sue Scotland Yard for discrimination claiming he is pulled over without justification 'all the time' ‘We need to keep highlighting it all the time. Racism has not gone away.’ Reflecting on her elder son’s death in April 1993, she said: ‘It still doesn’t seem like 20 years. It’s been a long journey.’ Mrs Lawrence said more would be done this year to ensure no other family has to go through what she endured, including the launch of a programme for fairer community policing. In 1999, Neville Lawrence, Stuart and Stephen’s father, was stopped and interviewed over a robbery allegation as he drove through London. Mr Lawrence and his cousin were held for up to 20 minutes as they were quizzed by two officers investigating a robbery half an hour earlier. The pair had nothing to do with the offence, and it emerged that Mr Lawrence had made a formal complaint about the incident. He and Doreen, who was then his wife, received £320,000 compensation from the Met for its botched handling of their son’s murder. Stephen, 18, was killed by a gang of white youths as he waited at a bus stop in Eltham, South-East London, in April 1993. Two of that gang, Gary Dobson and David Norris, were jailed for life exactly 12 months ago yesterday. Mrs Lawrence continues to press for the arrest of others involved in the murder. During the trial, the court heard that five or six thugs had set upon her A-level student son. Following the trial, Stuart revealed how he had rebuilt his life following his brother’s brutal murder by continuing his studies in London and then graduating from university with a degree in graphic communication before embarking on a teaching career. He said it is sometimes years before he tells work colleagues and acquaintances that he is Stephen’s brother. ‘I’ve worked hard to be my own person, at my profession, so no one can say I am just Stephen Lawrence’s brother,’ he told a Sunday newspaper last January. ‘People say they can try to imagine what you’re going through, but the only people who really do know are those closest to you. And for me that’s my partner.’ He said he had been pulled over by police ‘loads of times’. ‘They come out with the same excuse, that it’s because cars like this one have been stolen in the area,’ he added. ‘I don’t tell them I am Stephen Lawrence’s brother, but I give my name and then say my mum is on the Stop and Search Community Panel and then they suddenly become increasingly apologetic.’ The panel was set up by the Home Office amid allegations that police had overstepped the mark with the searches. Recent research showed that black people are six times more likely to be stopped by police than white people. The Metropolitan Police faced fierce criticism for its original investigation into Stephen’s death. A public inquiry branded the force institutionally racist and claims were made by family lawyers that some officers were influenced by Norris’s former drugs baron father. The breakthrough in the investigation came when a cold case team of forensic scientists found tiny traces of blood, hair and fibres on clothing seized from the homes of Dobson and Norris. During the trial, jurors were shown police surveillance footage from 1994 of the pair using racial slurs. Scotland Yard said last night: ‘The use of stop and search is an important tool to combat crime and it is one of a range of tactics deployed daily in order to keep Londoners safe. ‘We have worked hard over the years to establish robust scrutiny processes and transparency is essential to us. ‘The consistent message from our engagement with the public is that the wider community support stop and search as long as it is carried out fairly and professionally and that officers are accountable for their actions. ‘We are not complacent and  continually review our progress to ensure we are delivering a policing service that meets the needs of all Londoners – not least in the area of stop and search.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Stuart Lawrence, 35, has been left furious by harassment .

The EU’s disastrous Common Fisheries Policy suffered a blow last night after MEPs gave local fishing groups more control over the seas. Campaigners hailed a victory against ‘micro-managers’ in Brussels after MEPs voted for reform. A ban on the scandalous practice of discarding dead fish also moved a step closer to completion. The Common Fisheries Policy was originally adopted in the name of protecting depleted stocks . Reform: MEPs voted for reform of European fisheries policy that would hand more power to regional fishing organisations . It has handed control over Britain’s historic fishing rights to other member states and potentially cost the country billions in lost jobs and revenue. Fishermen are forced to dump hundreds of thousands of tons of dead fish into the North Sea because it is illegal to land them. Some British politicians have called for the policy to be scrapped completely, arguing that every country enforces the rules differently. MEPs stopped short of total repatriation, but agreed to hand more powers to regional fishing organisations.

No control: Centralised control over Britain¿s historic fishing rights, with decisions made by other member states, has potentially cost the country billions in lost jobs and revenue . Scottish Conservative MEP Struan Stevenson said the deal would ‘wrest control away from the micro-managers in Brussels who have made such an absolute mess of fisheries policy for the past 30 years’. He added: ‘We will also see an urgent timetable set for an absolute ban on the scandal of dumping and discards. ‘Every vote counted, but I believe the public would never have forgiven MEPs if we had failed to take this opportunity to stop the discards debacle.’ UKIP MEP Stuart Agnew, who is also the party’s fisheries representative, said the Common Fisheries Policy was ‘one of the EU’s biggest disasters to date’.

Detectives have identified 49 offences against vulnerable patients by Jimmy Savile during decades of abuse. Most of the 13 hospitals involved have launched investigations into how the sexual predator was able to abuse sick youngsters in their care between 1962 and 1995. With dozens of the victims preparing to sue, NHS trusts face having to pay out hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation. Monster: Jimmy Savile with female patients at Stoke Mandeville Hospital - the DJ's abuse there and at other institutions have become well known . Savile was found to have committed a ‘full range’ of sex crimes – from minor assaults to rape. The offences include 22 at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire, 16 at Leeds General Infirmary and one – perhaps the most shocking of all – against a dying child at Great Ormond Street in London in 1971. The DJ even assaulted patients at four secure psychiatric units, including Broadmoor where police believe up to five attacks took place. There are thought to have been further victims at the Wheatfields Sue Ryder cancer hospice in Leeds but none survived to speak out. In 1977 Savile groped and made lewd comments to a girl aged under 16 who was visiting a sick relative there. The official report into Savile’s abuse highlighted how the Top of the Pops presenter used his celebrity image and charitable acts to dupe hospitals into allowing him near ill children. It says: ‘At Leeds General Infirmary, Broadmoor Hospital and Stoke Mandeville Hospital he was taken at face value as a volunteer and fundraiser, probably because of his growing celebrity status. Astounding: How Savile managed to carry out a catalogue of abuse at hospitals around the UK is shocking . Having been accepted at these institutions he gained access to vulnerable children and adults.’ The internal investigations are looking at how Savile was allowed to get away with his crimes and why in some cases he was given special access to vulnerable patients. Incredibly, the Department of Health made him the head of a taskforce overseeing Broadmoor mental health hospital in 1988. In that role, he was given an office, a flat, keys to secure units and access to deeply disturbed and dangerous patients, including Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe. A patient has reported being assaulted by Savile at Broadmoor in 1991. West London Mental Health NHS Trust said an internal investigation into abuse at the secure unit had already inspected thousands of documents. Steve Shrubb, the trust’s chief executive, said: ‘We welcome the Metropolitan Police report into the alleged criminal activities perpetrated by Jimmy Savile. ‘The scale and nature of the incidents described in the report is deeply distressing for all those involved.’ A Great Ormond Street Hospital spokesman said: ‘The contents of this report are clearly extremely distressing for all those involved. ‘In regards to the allegation made in connection with our organisation, we were made aware of this by the Metropolitan Police very recently. It relates to an incident in the early 1970s.’ Two of the psychiatric hospitals where abuse was carried out have since closed: Saxondale in Nottinghamshire and High Royds in Leeds. Many have since been taken over by different health trusts who said they had no idea of Savile’s former involvement. Wirral Community NHS Trust, which runs a health centre on the site where Savile abused a patient of the former St Catherine’s Hospital in Birkenhead, said it did not run the hospital in 1964 when the abuse took place. A spokesman said: ‘We are shocked to hear of the allegation about Jimmy Savile which has been revealed by the Metropolitan Police.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Savile abused hospital patients between the years of 1962 and 1995 .

Listen to public anger: International Development Secretary Justine Greening said it was time tackle issues such as waste and corruption . Ministers must start listening to public anger about the soaring aid budget, instead of just ‘shouting louder’ at those who disagree, the International Development Secretary said yesterday. In a major shift of tone, Justine Greening said it was time to start tackling public concerns about issues like waste and corruption, rather than just lecturing people about the benefits of aid. Speaking at an event for aid charities in London, she said: ‘I know there are many people in our country who think that international development should not be a priority - that instead we should spend the money here in Britain. 'They think that the money is spent on countries that don’t use it effectively, or on projects that aren’t worthwhile. ‘And I know that the temptation for many of us when confronted by anyone arguing against you is just to argue back, just to shout louder at them. ‘But I came into politics because I believe that people have a right to be heard, and I believe that they have a right to be listened to.’ The aid budget will rise dramatically in April as the percentage of Britain’s income spent on foreign rises from 0.56 per cent to 0.7 per cent - the level controversially pledged by David Cameron. Meeting the target will require an increase in aid spending from £8.65 billion this year to £11.3 billion next year - a rise of more than 30 per cent. Miss Greening said ministers had to make a better case for the rapidly increasing aid budget, spelling out the potential benefits for trade and security. But she said some of the arguments raised by critics were legitimate and needed to be addressed. ‘Can we address these concerns by better explaining what we are doing and making our case, or do some of those concerns reflect genuine issues that need to be sorted out?’ she said. ‘As ever, the answer is that it’s a bit of both.’ Foreign spend: Controversially pledged by David Cameron, the aid budget will rise dramatically in April as the percentage of Britain's income spent on foreign rises from 0.56 per cent to 0.7 per cent . Miss Greening, a former accountant, has introduced a series of financial controls since taking charge of the Department for International Development (Dfid) in September last year. These include slashing the size of projects that can be signed off without ministerial approval, new rules for consultants and a fresh crackdown on corruption. But she acknowledged the need to go . further, saying: ‘Tackling corruption means not only finding those who . steal money but throwing the book at those outside actors in other . countries that help it to happen - those people who pay the bribes, the . lawyers and financiers that launder the proceeds.’ Miss Greening has suspended aid to Rwanda because of human rights and stopped payments to Uganda because of corruption. Tackling corruption: Miss Greening has suspended aid to Rwanda because of human rights and stopped payments to Uganda because of corruption . She said the decision had been ‘difficult, but... necessary’ to retain public confidence, adding: ‘We are often working in complex situations. Even so, where we see the trend moving in the wrong direction on corruption and on human rights, we will not simply stand by and ignore that.’ But she defended the policy of targeting aid on so-called ‘fragile states’, saying: ‘It is in our national interest to support these countries. Whether it be terrorism in Afghanistan, piracy in Somalia or crime in West Africa, we know that instability overseas means we eventually foot a bigger bill here in the UK. Problems tend not to solve themselves, rather without action, they too often tend to grow.’ Miss Greening said she wanted to encourage more private sector investment in developing countries, adding: ‘To those of you who think private sector investment is part of the problem, I think you are wrong.’ She said her priorities included economic development, promoting the rights of women and girls and encouraging better value for money and transparency.","International Development Secretary said the public concerns should be tackled rather than just lecturing about the benefits of aid .

White people are suffering from an unspoken racism in Britain, according to the mother of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence. Doreen Lawrence will this week warn that British society is going ‘backwards’ in terms of equality and that white minority groups are among those facing racism. Despite some progress on race and equality in the 20 years since her son’s murder, in many ways the problems are getting worse as racism is ‘no longer on the political agenda’, she will say. Politics and professions are dominated by an ‘old boys’ network’, according to Mrs Lawrence – who will say that we still live in a country ‘organised and shaped’ by race. Doreen Lawrence, Mother of murdered student Stephen Lawrence, will this week warn that British society is going 'backwards' in terms of equality and that white minority groups are among those facing racism . Mrs Lawrence, 60, will say that racism within the British education system is holding back talented black youngsters. It is more difficult for black students than white people to achieve a first-class degree, she will claim. Those who do obtain qualifications and have so-called ‘good accents’ still suffer from racism, she will say. Mrs Lawrence’s remarks will come in a speech she is to deliver at the opening of a research centre specialising in race and education at Birmingham University later this week. ‘Race matters: it matters to all of us,’ she will say. ‘Crucially, when we talk about race we are not just talking about the experiences of black and minority ethnic groups. ‘We are also talking about the experiences of white groups. Yet this is something that we, as a society, seldom acknowledge or discuss.’ Mrs Lawrence will add: ‘I want – we all want – a society in which we can live safely and freely irrespective of the colour of our skin. ‘We want a society in which success and choice are not merely limited to the few but are available to all. A society where the old boys’ network – in other words a network which is male, wealthy and white –- no longer automatically leads across the professions and our Parliament. ‘Just as we are a society that continues to be organised and shaped by class and by gender, we are a society that – some 20 years after Stephen’s murder – continues to be organised and shaped by race.’ Despite some progress on race and equality in the 20 years since her son¿s murder, in many ways the problems are getting worse as racism is 'no longer on the political agenda', she will say . Professor David Gillborn, director of the new centre, said: ‘Debates about education are almost solely based around class but what we have found is that, despite having a professional education and good income and knowing their way around the education system, black middle-class parents still face an uphill battle against the chronic low expectations that many teachers bring to their interactions with black children.’ Stephen Lawrence, 18, a student who was hoping to become an architect, was stabbed to death by a gang of racist white youths in Eltham, South East London, in April 1993. Last year two men, Gary Dobson and David Norris, were jailed for life for his murder following a campaign to bring them to justice supported by the Daily Mail. Following Stephen’s death, a public inquiry into the police’s handling of the tragedy concluded the Metropolitan Police was institutionally racist. Earlier this year, Mrs Lawrence was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of York in recognition for her work against racism. At the ceremony on January 25 she was praised for ‘devoting a large part of her life to social justice’. She was also honoured for her ‘tireless campaign against racism and inequality’ as a result of her lengthy wait to see her son’s murderers jailed. Accepting the award, Mrs Lawrence said: ‘I see education as the most precious gift that we can give our children.’ In the years after her son’s death, Mrs Lawrence founded the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust to help young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. She also sits on the board of Liberty, the human rights organisation, and is a patron of the hate-crime charity Stop Hate UK. In 2003, she was appointed an OBE for services to community relations. Last summer she was chosen as a flagbearer at the Opening Ceremony for the London 2012 Olympics, alongside boxer Muhammad Ali and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Last year, Mrs Lawrence also received a special prize at the Women of the Year awards, as well as another honorary doctorate from the University of East London.

Battle: Iain Duncan Smith claimed ministers will 'shut the door' to migrants wanting to come to Britain to live on benefits . Ministers will ‘shut the door’ to migrants wanting to come to Britain to live on benefits, Iain Duncan Smith claimed yesterday. He said he was determined to tighten the rules around eligibility for welfare benefits before a predicted influx of migrants from Romania and Bulgaria next year. The Work and Pensions Secretary also suggested new rules to stop so-called benefit tourists could be applied to all migrants, even those from the rest of the European Union. The measures could include requiring people to show they had put down roots here before claiming state help. Under the ‘habitual resident test’, migrants could in future be required to show they had leased a home in this country for a year before being entitled to benefits. Changes could also require contributions to have been made before some benefits can be claimed for the first time. In a direct challenge to the EU, Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘My view of life is simple – we make sure our door is shut to those who want to come and claim benefits and is open to those who want to come and contribute and work and make this economy good and strong.’ He acknowledged he faces a ‘big battle’ with the EU, which is already threatening to sue Britain over existing rules on how quickly migrants can claim benefits. The issue is wrapped up in the free movement of labour rules, which are jealously guarded by Brussels. But Mr Duncan Smith said ministers were building a powerful alliance with countries such as the Netherlands, Sweden and Germany, which also want to see changes. Stop benefits tourists: The Work and Pensions Secretary is determined to tighten the rules around eligibility for welfare benefits before a predicted influx of migrants from Romania and Bulgaria next year . Mr Duncan Smith said he had held talks on the issue with Home Secretary Theresa May . He revealed Britain is also doing . battle with Brussels over the ‘completely crackers’ rules that see . £1million a week in welfare payments sent to children who live abroad . while their migrant parents work in this country. He suggested that both issues would form part of David Cameron’s demands as he tries to claw back powers from the EU. The planned crackdown will be discussed at Chequers this week by the Prime Minister, Chancellor George Osborne and the Tories’ new election chief Lynton Crosby, who wants to put immigration and welfare at the heart of the 2015 election campaign. Mr Duncan Smith said he had held talks on the issue with Home Secretary Theresa May. Whitehall fears that any move targeted at Romanian and Bulgarian migrants, who will be free to come and work in this country from the end of the year, would be certain to be ruled illegal by the EU.

Iain Duncan Smith has criticised unemployed graduates who consider themselves ‘too good’ for menial jobs. Geology graduate Cait Reilly won a landmark court case last week after complaining she had been subjected to ‘forced labour’ because she risked losing her benefits if she refused to do work experience at discount store Poundland. The Work and Pensions Secretary pointed out that former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy started his career at the retailer stacking shelves. Lashed out: Iain Dunan Smith has attacked graduates who think they are 'too good' to stack shelves . Tough talk: The Work and Pensions Secretary was speaking to Eddie Mair on the Andrew Marr Show today . In a direct rebuke to Miss Reilly, he added: ‘The next time one of these smart people that say there’s something wrong with this goes into their supermarket, ask themselves this simple question. ‘When they can’t find the food on the shelves, who is more important: Them, the geologist, or the person that stacked the shelf?’ Example: Former Tesco CEO, Sir Terry Leahy, started his career at the retailer stacking shelves . Miss Reilly, 24, is now working part-time in a supermarket. She said she did not object to menial work – simply the fact that she was not being paid. Last week’s Appeal Court ruling forced ministers to hurriedly re-write the rules surrounding a string of back-to-work schemes, and could result in compensation of more than £40million being paid to jobless claimants who had their benefits stopped for refusing to do work experience. In a defiant intervention on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show yesterday, Mr Duncan Smith made it clear he would not back down. Denying claims of ‘slave labour’, he said: ‘She was paid jobseeker’s allowance by the taxpayer to do this. 'Most young people love this programme and I am sorry but there are a group of people out there who think they are too good for this kind of stuff.’ He added: ‘I am not going to give way on this. I absolutely clearly tell you this: People who think it is their right to take benefit and do nothing for it – those days are over.’ Last week’s ruling found that the Government’s regulations failed to give the unemployed enough information, especially about the sanctions for refusing jobs under the schemes. But it rejected Miss Reilly’s claim that being forced to do unpaid work experience breached her human rights. Miss Reilly said last week: ‘I don’t think I am above working in Poundland.’ Rebuke: Mr Duncan Smith dismissed suggestions the flagship back-to-work scheme is 'slave labour'","He vows not to back down after court rules against flagship work scheme .

But Afghan President Hamid Karzai showed he has a taste for the finer things in life this week – by asking the British taxpayer to put him and his  40-strong entourage up at Claridge’s during a stay in London. Claridge’s, in Mayfair, has been a byword for luxury for 200 years and is one of the world’s most expensive hotels. Basic rooms start at £300, but the suites favoured by rock stars, celebrities and world leaders can cost almost £7,000 per night. Do as I say, not as I do: Afghan President Hamid Karzai was in London for talks with the Pakistan president . The Foreign Office agreed to pick up the bill for President Karzai and ten of his entourage, while the Afghan government – bankrolled to the tune of £175million a year by the British taxpayer via the soaring foreign aid budget – paid the rest of the cost. The Afghan leader was in the UK for two days of talks at Chequers with David Cameron and Pakistan’s President Asif Ali Zardari. President Zardari and his entourage were also put up in the lap of luxury by the British taxpayer. The Pakistani leader favoured the Berkeley Hotel in Knightsbridge, conveniently located just around the corner from Harrods. Single rooms start at £240 a night, with suites running well into four figures. The epitome of luxury: Claridge's' long-standing links with royalty have led to it being called an 'annexe to Buckingham Palace' Art Deco classic: The hotel's foyer is a favourite place for a traditional British afternoon tea, but there is often a long waiting list . Liveried staff: The recent television series Inside Claridge's offered a fascinating peek into the luxury London hotel . The Foreign Office declined to comment on how much the two-day visit had cost taxpayers. But it is unlikely to have been cheap. Claridge’s top-of-the-range Brook penthouse, favoured by the global elite, costs £6,900 a night. For that money guests get a vast suite the size of a large terraced house, with commanding views over central London. The suite is described as an ‘elegant art deco-style apartment decorated in gentle lilac with light oak floors’. More modest suites in the luxury hotel start at around £1,000 a night. Afternoon tea is £40 per head. British Prime Minister David Cameron with Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari, left, and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, right, at Chequers this week .

The young victim of an acid attack says she wanted to die when she first saw her  disfigured face. Naomi Oni, 20, was returning home from work at a Victoria’s Secret store when she was attacked by a woman wearing a Islamic niqab, which leaves only the eyes uncovered. She spent a month in a burns unit and, despite fears she had been blinded, has recovered sight in her left eye and partial vision in her right. Last night she said: ‘The first time I looked I was shocked. I didn’t want to live after I saw my face. Shocked: Naomi Oni, 20, said that she no longer wanted to live after she saw how her face had been burned in the acid attack . Attacked: Miss Oni was walking home from her job at a Victoria's Secret lingerie store when acid was hurled in her face . Brave: Miss Oni has spoken out about her injuries to help police catch the veiled attacker . ‘My head was ten times the size, my face was black, my eyes were swollen and my eyes were cutting out. ‘I thought I was going to go blind. I was terrified.’ Miss Oni was attacked after getting off a bus close to her home in Dagenham, East London, shortly after midnight on 30 December. ‘I got off at the bus stop of my house and was about to cross the road, I felt a presence behind me so I decided to look back,’ she told the BBC. ‘I saw what seemed to be a lady wearing what I think is a hijab, which was mostly black. ‘I remember being startled and shocked, thinking I don’t remember her getting off the bus with me, I didn’t hear footsteps behind me. The person was just staring back at me.' Naomi Oni, 20, said: 'God has given me a life for a reason and that's what keeps me going' Miss Oni said she then felt something . being thrown at her: ‘Before I could feel it burning, I just knew it . was acid, I thought OK someone is out to ... kill me. Mystery: Police have been unable to identify Miss Oni's attacker because they were wearing a niqab (file picture) ‘I have no clue why someone would do . this to me. I still ask myself the same question every day, Why me? What . have I done? I didn’t understand. 'That person failed, whatever their . aim was, they failed. God has given me a life for a reason and that’s . what keeps me going.’ Last night  the mother of Miss Oni’s boyfriend . Ato said she believes the attacker  was specifically targeting her. Shelley Owede said: ‘I don’t think someone was hanging around, I think . that someone was really targeting her. They were going for her.  I’m . thinking it was somebody  she knows or somebody who knows her that she . doesn’t know. ‘People think it’s random, but I don’t think it’s random. People don’t go about carrying acid in the middle of the night. ‘For them to have got it and then . waited for a woman who is vulnerable, I think it is somebody who knows . her rather than a random person.’ Mrs Owede said Miss Oni has not had . difficulties in previous relationships or been in trouble in the past . and is puzzled by the motive. She said: ‘I don’t know. She’s quiet, she’s a quiet girl. She goes to work and is home. ‘She is the sole carer for her mum so doesn’t really go out a lot. She’s home most of the time.’ Mrs Owede added that Miss Oni had . raised concerns about returning home from her late shifts with her . bosses. She said Miss Oni was wearing her normal work clothes, but there . was nothing to identify her as a Victoria’s Secret employee. She said: ‘She’s been complaining to . her workplace about the late shifts. They don’t dress proactively, they . just dress casually. She wasn’t carrying a Victoria’s Secret bag.’ The Metropolitan Police has said officers are keeping an open mind as to the motive. Naomi Oni was probably attacked with sulphuric acid, which can strip away outer layers of the skin within seconds and cause blindness if it enters the eyes. In 2008, model Katie Piper suffered horrific burns to her face and neck when she was attacked with the chemical. It burned through four layers of her skin, damaged her throat and left her blind in one eye. The attack was orchestrated by a jealous ex-boyfriend, Daniel Lynch, who has since been jailed for life. The 29-year-old model has had a series of skin grafts and operations to reconstruct her face. Surgeons took tissue from her legs and buttocks and combined it with artificial skin to encourage healing. Miss Oni will probably undergo similar treatment.

Guilty: Senior counter-terrorism detective April Casburn was yesterday found guilty of trying to sell information to the News of the World. Casburn is pictured leaving court yesterday . A senior counter-terrorism officer was facing jail last night after being convicted of offering to sell inside information about the phone-hacking investigation to the News of the World. Detective Chief Inspector April Casburn rang the newspaper days after Scotland Yard began a review of evidence that its journalists had illegally intercepted mobile phone messages. Casburn, 53, who worked for the Met’s SO15 counter-terrorism command, is the first person convicted as part of Operation Elveden, the multi-million pound investigation into whether journalists illegally paid public officials for information. So far, 53 people have been arrested. The £65,000-a-year officer was found guilty of misconduct in public office at the end of a three-day trial. Judge Mr Justice Fulford told Casburn, who has a three-year-old adopted child, that her actions were a ‘substantial breach of trust’ and there was a ‘real possibility’ that she would face prison. Social workers will write a report about the child’s future before she is sentenced. She faces dismissal from the Met and being stripped of much of her pension. Casburn, who has two grown-up sons from her first marriage, had a ‘difficult divorce’ from her second husband and had undergone two failed IVF attempts when she made the phone call to the News of the World in September 2010, the court heard. In 2011 she was off work for two months with ‘situation stress’ following claims of bullying by male bosses within SO15, with one superintendent admitting in evidence that he sent her text messages signed with kisses. Casburn returned to work that October, saying she was not well but feared that her adoption application with her third husband would be affected. Scroll down for video . Prosecuted: Casburn was told she could face an 'immediate custodial sentence. She previously admitted going to the News of the World was a 'foolish decision' When arrested in the December, she was . on adoption leave and her only worry was for the toddler, who had lived . with her in Chelmsford, Essex for just a few days.

After the verdict, Detective Chief Superintendent Gordon Briggs . said: ‘It’s a great disappointment that a DCI in the counter-terror . command should have abused her position in this way. Firm: Speaking outside court, Detective Chief Superintendent Gordon Briggs said it is unacceptable for a serving police officer to leak confidential information to journalists for private gain . Claims: Casburn told jurors that some of her colleagues were excited about meeting Sienna Miller, pictured . There’s no place . for corrupt officers or staff in the Metropolitan Police Service. She . betrayed the service and let down her colleagues.’ Casburn had rung the News of the World news desk and revealed details . about Operation Varec, the police investigation into phone hacking at . the now defunct Sunday paper. She told journalist Tim Wood that six people were under suspicion . including former editor Andy Coulson, at that time David Cameron’s . communications chief. She said detectives were under pressure from Lord . [John] Prescott and the operation was a waste of resources. Mr Wood . emailed two colleagues to say a ‘senior police woman’ wanted to ‘sell . inside information’. This email was handed to the police by the paper’s publisher, News . International, and Casburn was arrested. The News of the World did not . publish any information and did not pay Casburn. The Met reopened its phone-hacking probe after reports that it was more . widespread than had been admitted following the conviction of the . paper’s former royal correspondent Clive Goodman and private . investigator Glenn Mulcaire for intercepting voicemails in what was . described as an isolated case of ‘rogue reporting’. The newspaper closed in July 2011. Dozens of politicians, celebrities . and victims of crime who had their voicemails intercepted have since . accepted out-of-court settlements worth millions of pounds.

Smitten to sour: Author Patricia Cornwell had a lesbian affair with a leading British police chief but she broke it off and told police that she was a threat to her . Best-selling author Patricia Cornwell had a lesbian affair with a leading British police chief when the pair became ‘smitten’ with each other. But the crime writer, 56, broke off the liaison and later told detectives that Caroline Nicholl, a former chief superintendent with Thames Valley Police, was a threat to her. The American’s relationship with Miss Nicholl was revealed in US court papers alleging that financial managers wasted her multi-million dollar fortune. The women met through a mutual friend and their affair started when Miss Nicholl invited the writer to do research in Milton Keynes, where she was in charge of policing 17 years ago. Miss Nicholl, 57, said: ‘Yes, we did have a relationship. It lasted a matter of months. We must have seen each other probably no more than ten times. ‘She was very smart, self-effacing and charming, and clearly was enamoured that I was a police chief. She thought the uniform was amazing. ‘I didn’t know who she was. I’d never read any of her books. So I was expecting an old biddy or something. ‘The next time we met was when she was on a book tour in London. I invited her up to Milton Keynes because she liked to do research. She was smitten with me and I was smitten with her.’ According to the documents filed in Boston, Miss Cornwell said the affair ‘ended badly’. She listed Miss Nicholl at the top of a list of ‘enemies’ given to US police investigating suspected threats against her five years ago. Emails from 2008 show that Miss Cornwell allegedly asked detectives to conduct checks on Miss Nicholl. She wrote: ‘I have a few names of people who we should be “aware” of in terms of them being a problem/threat to me.’ On Miss Nicholl, she said: ‘I once had a relationship with her that ended badly. I cut her off and wouldn’t have anything to do with her. She might have animosity. We should know where she is.’ Others on the list included a celebrity psychic, rival crime writer and two female journalists she claimed were jealous of her success. Last night, Miss Nicholl told the Daily Mail that Miss Cornwell had abruptly ended their relationship but she was mystified by the claims. ‘I have had no contact with Patricia Cornwell since 1995 or 1996 and have no idea why she would have any “allegations” concerning myself,’ she said. ‘There wasn’t any incident or incidents other than Cornwell’s abrupt cessation of the brief transatlantic relationship. I was then living in Buckinghamshire, she in Virginia.’ Miss Nicholl gained a high profile for her alternative methods in Milton Keynes, such as criminals meeting their victims. She was one of Britain’s youngest chief superintendents and featured in a Channel 4 documentary in 1995. 'Thought uniform was amazing': Miss Nicholl (right) said she did have a relationship with Miss Cornwell (left) and said she was 'very smart, self-effacing and charming, and clearly was enamoured that I was a police chief' Three years later, she was head-hunted by police chiefs in Washington DC. She still lives in the US, running her own consultancy and working as a government advisor. Miss Cornwell has sold 100million books and is best-known for her series of 20 novels featuring forensic pathologist Kay Scarpetta. She is suing her former financial advisers for damages estimated at £65million for negligence and breach of contract. The writer, who earns £6million a year, said she has had  to sell her fleet of sports cars and helicopter. She faces counter-claims that she and her partner, Dr Staci Gruber, a Harvard  neuropsychologist, simply squandered the money.

Thousands of British families could be denied compensation for the deaths or illness of relatives caused by a dangerous diabetes drug, despite similar cases being settled at a cost of billions of dollars in the U.S. Pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline has agreed to pay claims of victims in the U.S., but it has told British victims that it will challenge their requests for compensation in court, their lawyers have said. The diabetes drug Avandia had its European licence revoked in September 2010 because of evidence it could cause heart failure or heart attacks. Danger: The diabetes drug Avandia had its European licence revoked in September 2011 because of evidence it could cause heart failure or heart attacks . GlaxoSmithKline, which is based in the UK, has admitted concealing data about the damaging side effects of the drug, but it has told victims it is not willing to settle UK claims without a court fight. Daniel Slade, of Express solicitors, which is representing 19 victims, said that that unlike in the U.S. where GSK has settled claims outside of court, it will contest the cases here. He said that it will now take years for bereaved families or those harmed by the drug to get any sort of compensation. He told The Guardian: ‘It is very disappointing. We anticipate that these claims do have a good prospect of success, but they still have to prove their case in the UK with suitable evidence. ‘They are tasked with having to produce that evidence, including medical expert opinion. It is a burden one would have thought they might not have to go through.’ A spokesman for GlaxoSmithKline told the newspaper: ‘We have every sympathy for people with complications associated with diabetes and those who care for them, but unfortunately we are unable to comment on individual legal cases. ‘We continue to believe that the company acted appropriately and responsibly in its management of Avandia.’ Battle: GlaxoSmithKline has told victims in Britain it is not willing to settle claims without a court fight . There were around 90,000 people taking Avandia in the UK when it was banned, eight years after it was introduced in the NHS in 2000. It was given to people with type 2 diabetes whose glucose levels could not be controlled by standard drugs. Trials on the drug found that it could cause heart attacks and made patients more likely to suffer strokes and heart failure. GSK pleaded guilty to federal charges of concealing data about the drug’s side effects. It agreed to pay $3bn to the U.S. government in November 2011 over issues with the drug and to end investigations into the marketing of antidepressants Paxil and Wellbutrin.","Drug company has settled similar cases in US at cost of billions of dollars .

She's normally known for her combative interviewing style, but BBC radio presenter Shelagh Fogarty was left shrieking in fear when a surprise studio guest made an appearance yesterday. BBC 5 Live lunchtime presenter Miss Fogarty started screaming and leapt on her chair live on air after a guest spotted a mouse running around the studio. The 47-year-old was interviewing Mike Linnell from drugs charity Lifeline Project live on air at the BBC's Salford studio just before 1pm when her guest spotted the unwelcome rodent. Scroll down for video . Surprise guest: The presenter was visibly shocked when the mouse made an appearance in the studio shortly before 1pm yesterday . Horror: Miss Fogarty leapt up in horror and kneeled on her chair . Startled: Studio guest Mike Linnell clutched his chest as he saw the mouse prompting presenter Shelagh Fogarty to think that he had been taken ill . Amused: Mr Linnell was initially shocked at the sight of the mouse but was later amused at Miss Fogarty's reaction . She screamed: 'Don't tell me you can see it, please stop, just get it out of here, oh god, oh, I don't want to carry on doing this programme, please someone get rid of the mouse.' The brazen mouse was clearly not as afraid of Miss Fogarty as she was of it as it ran onto the desk and across her hand. The usually calm and composed presenter became upset and changed studio following the incident. Mr Linnell told her that he had seen the rodent when he faltered as he answered a question and she asked if there was something wrong. 'Oh my god, oh, oh how horrible,' screamed Miss Fogarty. 'Oh gosh sorry I'm live on the radio squealing and kneeling on my chair because there's a mouse in the room. 'I thought you were unwell. I'm going to leave it there because I am not sure I can continue interviewing in a a serious manner when I know there is a mouse scurrying around my feet.' Shock: Miss Fogarty expressed her embarrassment at having screamed on air and briefly regained her composure before squealing in fear again . Drama: Workers looked around the studio for the mouse but were unable to find it, prompting Miss Fogarty to move studios . Miss Fogarty appeared to regain her composure, telling listeners: 'I'm just about OK, but these feet aren't touching the ground, I've got big boots on as well, there's no way this mouse could do me harm, it's quite ridiculous.' She started screaming again moments later when the mouse was spotted again, begging others in the studio to get rid of the animal. She said: 'If it walks on my hand I'm resigning. It's on the bloody table.' Presenter: BBC 5 Live's Shelagh Fogarty was caught unawares by the rodent as it made an appearance in her Salford Quays studio . Miss Fogarty was then forced to move studio in the middle of her programme after the mouse walked over her hand off air. At the end of her show, she told BBC 5 Live colleague Richard Bacon: ‘I was in the other studio as normal earlier on and at two minutes to one, one of my guests just went “huh” and clutched his chest, I thought “oh my god, he’s having a heart attack”, and I said “are you OK?”, and he said, “I’ve just seen a mouse” and pointed to the little holes in the desk from where various wires come, and there was a little mouse sitting in there. 'I squealed and put my feet up on the chair as I did not want them on the floor. 'But the floor was not the issue and the mouse was then on the table and came across my hand. It was just horrible.’ She added: ‘I’m off to breathe deeply and recover from the mouse incident, eugh.’ Hours . after the incident, staff had still been unable to capture the mouse. Newsreader Rachel Hodges told listeners: ‘He could be anywhere. Someone . was trying to catch him in a coffee cup with a lid but failed. The mouse . is on the loose.’ The mouse was spotted in the Corporation's new multi-million pound home which only opened its doors back in 2011. Miss Fogarty is not the first BBC presenter to be startled by a mouse live on air. Just . last month BBC Three Counties weather girl Kate Kinsella was reading . out a bulletin on the Iain Lee breakfast show when she spotted a rodent . in the studio. She said: 'We could be seeing gale force winds from time to time during the afternoon. 'The good news is it will start to... AHH. Sorry there's a mouse just run past me in my studio.' The BBC's relocation to Salford has been the subject of widespread criticism, with high-ranking members of staff questioning the need for the huge expenditure on the move. The luxurious new base at Salford Quays, which houses programmes such as Blue Peter and Match of the Day, cost £200 million, with huge amounts of extra expenditure on staff relocation and transport between Manchester and London. The Director General of BBC North Peter Salmon has still not purchased a home in the north, despite claiming that he would relocate close to the Salford base in 2010, it was revealed yesterday.

A victim of a tower block fire that claimed six lives was told by a 999 operator to stay in her flat, until the call ended with screams as the burning ceiling fell in. Catherine Hickman, a 31-year-old designer, was on the phone to the fire brigade for an hour before she lost consciousness. She died along with two women and three children in the blaze caused by a faulty television set in the 14-storey residential building in Camberwell, south London, in July 2009, an inquest heard yesterday. Miss Hickman said her flat was ‘orange everywhere’ and smoke was coming through her floorboards. She asked the operator, “What shall I do? Shall I get out?” She was told to move to a different room but replied that she had moved on to the balcony. Counsel James Maxwell-Scott said: ‘She then said she had gone back into the flat because there was too much smoke. She asked if she should go downstairs or into the corridor. The operator said she ought not to open the door as she did not know what was on the other side.’ Jurors heard that the operator told her to get down on the floor and put something over her face to protect her from the smoke. Miss Hickman said she couldn’t breathe very well and was getting very hot. She then screamed: ‘Oh my God. I can see flames at the door. It’s choking inside in here.’ The operator told her that fire crews were in the building. Shortly before Miss Hickman stopped speaking and could no longer be heard breathing, she was heard screaming that something had fallen on her from the ceiling. Helen Udoaka, 34, and her 20-day-old daughter Michelle, were also killed in the blaze, along with Dayana Francisquini, 26, and her children, Thais, six, and Filipe, three. The electrical explosion ripped through a ninth floor flat and the flames spread to other flats in the block . They had all taken refuge in the . 11th-floor flat next door to Miss Hickman.

A workman suffered horrific burns to his arm after he was electrocuted with a million watts of power when he broke through a power cable with a jackhammer. Tom Sharp, 52, wasn't told that high voltage cables ran underneath a car park he was working on and he suffered serious burns from the shock, equivalent to 250,000 electric fires. The burns he suffered were so severe that his clothes seared to his skin causing 20 per cent burns to his arms, face and neck. He spent more than a month in hospital receiving treatment for his wounds. Horrific injuries: Building Tom Sharp, pictured left, was left with 20 per cent burns, right, after he received an electric shock after breaking through a cable with a jackhammer . The company who owned the car park, Northgate Vehicle Sales, in Darlington, County Durham, failed to apply for plans showing the location of the electrical services, Darlington Magistrates Court heard. The firm had employed Mr Sharp as a sub-contractor to erect a metal fence and he was digging holes using the groundbreaker when he hit a cable. The resulting shock was powerful enough to vaporise the circuit breaker's tip. Northgate Vehicle Services pleaded guilty to breaching health and safety regulations by failing to inform the main contractor of the underground cables. After admitting liability following a Health and Safety Executive (HSE) investigation, the company was fined £12,000 and ordered to pay £6,123 costs. Mr Sharp, from Crook, County Durham, spent more than a month in hospital after the incident in November 2010 and had physiotherapy and treatment for his burns for more than a year. He is still receiving therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the incident. Speaking after the hearing, Mr Sharp said: 'My physical injuries have improved in the last two years, but they are still not 100 per cent. 'I have problems with strength and movement in my arms and I've had to step back from some of the physical work involved in running my company. Painful: Mr Sharp was left hospitalised for a month after receiving 20 per cent burns following the shock . 'I'm still having psychological treatment. I go to therapy sessions to go to help me with post-traumatic stress. 'I was actually digging the last hole when it happened. I remember a massive, massive flash and just getting burned. I was thrown back by the electric shock.' HSE investigator Jonathan Wills told magistrates that Northgate Vehicle Sales was under a legal obligation to provide contractors with all reasonable safety information, including details of high voltage electricity cables. Mr Wills said: 'Northgate should have been able to do this simply by calling the utility company, which would have provided detailed plans. When asked why they had not requested such plans they said they had not . envisaged that there would be any cables in the area. 'This is an unusual comment, given that the company is based in a heavily industrialised area.' Defending the company Alison Gray said: 'Northgate Vehicle Sales entirely accepts that it was up to them to get the plans showing the cables and they did not do so. 'Staff did not believe there were cables in the area because the company has no need for high-voltage power and there is no sub-station nearby. 'They did provide information about cables for CCTV and lighting which shows they did provide information on some cables, but not others.' In a statement, David Henderson, Northgate Plc company secretary, said: 'The company has always placed a high priority on the health and safety of its staff, its contractors and other members of the public. 'The company has reviewed and amended its systems and procedures since this incident so as to prevent a reoccurrence.'","Tom Sharp was hospitalised for a month for treatment to his burns .

Heinz Co. bounced 20 per cent to $72.45 after the deal, which is the largest ever in the food industry. Heinz, based in Pittsburgh, also makes Classico spaghetti sauces, Ore-Ida potatoes and Smart Ones frozen meals. 'It's our kind of company,' Buffett said in an interview on CNBC, noting its signature ketchup has been around for more than a century. 'I've sampled it many times.' Secretary of State John Kerry and his Heinz heiress wife Teresa are licking their lips after the multi-billion dollar ketchup deal, which reportedly made them more than $670,000 today. The total value of their Heinz shares now stands at an estimated $4,029,123. Tomato sauce: Billionaire investor Warren Buffett, pictured, is dipping into the ketchup business as part of $23.3 billion deal to buy the Heinz ketchup company . The company was founded by Henry John Heinz and his neighbor L. Clarence Noble in 1869. The pair's first product was grated . horseradish, bottled in a clear glass to showcase its purity. The first . ketchup was introduced in 1876; the company says it was the country's . first commercial grade ketchup. Last year, Heinz says it had sales of $11.6 billion, with ketchup and sauces accounting for just under half of that. Given the saturated North American market, the company has increasingly looked overseas for growth. In 2013, emerging markets are expected to account for a quarter of the company's sales. Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital, . the investment firm which bought Burger King in 2010, say Heinz will . remain headquartered in Pittsburgh. Heinz CEO William Johnson said in a . statement that the company 'will have an opportunity to drive further . growth' as a private enterprise. Representatives for Heinz and the . investment group weren't able to immediately provide any further details . on the deal, including whether there would be any management changes or . layoffs. Buffett did not . immediately respond to a message from The Associated Press on Thursday. But he has recently said that he's been hunting for elephant-sized deals . and at the end of September he had $47.8 billion cash on hand to . finance any investments. Profitable: Last year, Heinz says it had sales of $11.6 billion, with its ketchup, pictured, and sauces accounting for just under half of that . Generally, Buffett prefers to buy . entire companies for his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate and then allow . the businesses to continue operating much the way they were before. Berkshire has also helped finance . deals before – most recently during the financial crisis of 2008, when . he made lucrative deals for Berkshire when few other companies had cash. Berkshire's biggest acquisition ever was its $26.3 billion purchase of BNSF railroad in 2010. Before that, it was the $16 billion stock purchase of reinsurance giant General Re in 1998. Heinz shareholders will receive $72.50 in cash for each share of common stock they own. The transaction value includes the assumption of Heinz's debt. Based on Heinz's number of shares outstanding, the deal is worth $23.3 billion excluding debt. The per-share price for the deal represents a 20 percent premium to Heinz's closing price of $60.48 on Wednesday. Heinz said the deal was unanimously approved by its board. Buffett said on CNBC that Berkshire is putting $12 billion to $13 billion into the deal. But he noted that Berkshire will still have room to make more acquisitions because its businesses continually replenish its cash supply. 'Anytime we see a deal is attractive and it's our kind of business and we've got the money, I'm ready to go,' Buffett said. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter. John Kerry, pictured right, and his wife Teresa Heinz Kerry, left, were reportedly licking their lips after Warren Buffett's $23.3 billion ketchup acquisition. The Heinz heiress and her secretary of state husband are said to have made around $670,000 on today's deal after shares bounced 20 per cent to $72.45 each. According to website Open Secrets, last year then-Senator Kerry disclosed slightly over $3 million worth of HJ Heinz Co. shares. Business Insider calculated that Kerry's stake in the company would have increased to about $3,357,603 at yesterday's close, after shares rose 11.92 per cent from December 30, 2011 through February 13, 2013. Add the 20 per cent jump on the back of news Buffett, who is renowned for his business savvy, is dipping in, and that's an additional increase of $671,520. The rise puts the couple's asset valuation of Heinz at $4,029,123, assuming they haven't sold any shares since Kerry's 2011 disclosure.","The billionaire investor's company Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital dipped into the 144-year-old Heinz with Buffett claiming 'I've sampled (the ketchup) many times'

New details: Secret documents have revealed that Jimmy Savile gave money to children and claimed it back on BBC expenses . Jimmy Savile made several secret payments to children at the height of his offending and managed to claim the cash back from the BBC as expenses, it was revealed today. Confidential documents show the paedophile handed £10 to three youngsters in 1974 - worth around £72 today - after they had appeared on his Clunk Click TV show. Savile, who was being paid the huge sum of £2,350 for every show he presented, demanded the money back and the Corporation obliged and never asked why he paid the children. A letter, dated April 18 1974, shows the transactions and has today been released by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act. 'We understand from London that during the above programme [Clunk Click] you dispersed £10 each to the following young people [names blanked out],' it says. 'We therefore enclose our cheque for £30 to reimburse you.' The payments were during the peak period of his predatory attacks, between 1966 and 1976, when he was aged between 40 and 50. In 1974 alone there were 30 occasions where he allegedly sexually abused both children and adults. Since October there have been 450 complaints to police about him - 214 have been recorded as crimes. His earliest offence was in Manchester in 1955, and the final reported allegation was in 2009 when he was aged 82. Some were allegedly attacked on BBC premises, including in his dressing room and the caravan he kept in the Television Centre car park in London. Concerns: Savile paid the youngsters in 1974, during his most prolific period of abuse, when he allegedly attacked people at BBC Television Centre (pictured) But despite abusing all over Britain he was never brought to justice even though police had chances to prosecute him while the DJ was alive. Yesterday it was revealed an officer from West Yorkshire Police is to be investigated after being accused of contacting Surrey Police on the DJ's behalf before they interviewed Savile over three alleged sex crimes in 2009. The reasons for these new secret payments to Clunk Click children are a mystery, but the BBC maintains there is no evidence that the youngsters were victims. A BBC spokeswoman told MailOnline: 'The document shows Savile was reimbursed the sum of £30 but there are no further details about this transaction which took place over 40 years ago'. Show: Sir Jimmy Savile is shown presenting his programme 'Clunk Click' alongside guest Max Bowker. It is not known which children Savile paid nearly 40 years ago . But the solicitor representing victims said the cash could be something more worrying. 'The payments could be deeply sinister, or it could just be that Savile was tight,' Alan Collins from the Pannone law firm told the Daily Express. 'We know he met kids in cafes and perhaps bought them drinks, but I can’t think why he would want to reimburse himself. 'It is well known he was reportedly tight-fisted, but given what we have learned over the past few months, one has got to keep an open mind about this.' The FOI shows other expenses claims he made when he was at the Corporation. It appears he demanded a new suit for every show he presented and asked for, and was given, an £1,800 pay rise per show in 1990 to allow for inflation - a huge sum at the time. He also asked for £200 travelling expenses for every programme because he lived in northern England, not London. A memo in 1989 said: 'Perhaps predictably Jimmy has raised the question of expenses using the argument that although he maintains a flat in London, he is now principally resident in Leeds.'","DJ gave £10 each - £72 today - to 3 young people on his Clunk Click show .

A woman who launched a racist rant against two students in a hospital A&E department wept in court yesterday as she was spared jail. Elizabeth Ward-Buck attacked a nurse and a policeman after she was filmed abusing two young women in the waiting room at Ipswich Hospital. She has now been handed a curfew and a suspended sentence and ordered to pay £265 over the violent incident. Scroll down for video . Attack: Elizabeth Ward-Buck, left, screamed racist abuse at student Gina Thompson, right, and her friend . MailOnline revealed earlier this month that Ward-Buck, 51, was caught on camera screaming racist abuse at Nigerian student Gina Thompson and her Spanish friend Barbara Iniesta. She asked the women where they were from, then shouted: ‘You're coming over here and you're pleading poverty. We are paying taxes you a***holes and we are going down in this crisis.’ Staff nurse Marian Tolosa ran over to see what was happening, but Ward-Buck pushed her then attacked another patient. The aggressive woman was taken to a side room by police, but she continued her rant and even tried to assault a police officer. South East Suffolk Magistrates' Court heard that Ward-Buck had been drinking earlier in the day on February 2, and had apparently contemplated walking into the sea at Aldeburgh. A friend of hers called an ambulance, and she was taken to the hospital where she had her run-in with the two students. Video: The woman was filmed shouting abuse at two students at Ipswich Hospital earlier this month . 'It was a very unfortunate and . distressing night from everyone's point of view,' defending lawyer . Michael Stephenson told the court. 'Mrs Ward-Buck is a good woman, she . has no criminal convictions.' He said she had suffered a . 'breakdown' that day, adding: 'She was very upset, a build-up of . pressure, stress, a death in the family, the demands of a teenage . family, her work as a carer and the needs of her husband. 'She felt terrible, she did not feel well.' Judge Celia Dawson told the . defendant: 'The nurse and police officer had come to defuse the . situation. They are entitled to go about their jobs without facing this . level of abuse.' Ward-Buck pleaded guilty to two counts of racially aggravated common assault and one of assaulting a police officer, and was sentenced to three months in prison, suspended for a year, and subjected to a curfew from 9pm to 6am every night. She was also ordered to pay £100 compensation to the assault victims as well as £85 costs and £80 to the victims fund. Rant: The woman shouted in front of about 20 shocked patients and friends or relatives at the hospital . Miss Thompson said last night that she did not hold a grudge against Ward-Buck despire being on the receiving end of her rant. 'Nothing like that has ever happened to me before,' she said, adding: 'I thought the verdict was very fair.' The 23-year-old student, who filmed . the incident on her phone and sent the footage to MailOnline, continued: . 'She held her hands up and she was very apologetic. I just wish her . well, I don't hold any grudges.' Miss Thompson, of Port Harcourt, . Nigeria, is a film and media student at University Campus Suffolk and . has been in the UK for two years, while 21-year-old Miss Iniesta arrived . from Seville last September. The woman shouted in front of about 20 . shocked patients and friends or relatives: ‘What has happened to this . f*****g country’, before directly abusing Miss Thompson who was sitting . down. She asked her ‘Where do you come from?’, to which Miss Thompson replied: ‘What does it matter where I'm from?’ The woman said: ‘We are paying taxes you a***holes and we are going down in this crisis’, before Miss Thompson replied: ‘Don't call me an a***hole’. But the woman said: ‘I will, because you're coming over here and you're pleading poverty. I am not well.’ Location: The two-minute clip was filmed at the A&E waiting room of Ipswich Hospital in Suffolk . But Miss Thompson responded: ‘You won't . call me an a***hole.

Thompson told MailOnline after the incident: ‘I was so embarrassed and I . couldn’t do anything because I was stuck in the situation, so we just . had to laugh about it.

Melissa Mackenzie, 21, lost control of her Vauxhall Corsa when she drove over newly laid chippings after enjoying a meal with her twin sister Sarah. The fashion store manageress, from Pwllheli in Gwynedd, Wales, was partially thrown out of the shattered driver's window, suffering the injury that led to her death. Ruling that the death was accidental, Coroner Dewi Pritchard-Jones said that had she been wearing a seat belt Miss Mackenzie would not have suffered the injuries that led to her death. He took the chance to reiterate the importance of wearing a seat belt, adding 'Seat belts . do save lives'. He said: 'If I look at the last twelve . months I have had four or five road traffic cases that were entirely . survivable if the people concerned had been wearing seat belts.' After the hearing, Miss Mackenzie's father Andrew said: 'She was responsible, independent and ambitious. She . was a high achiever.' Following her death, he described how his life had been 'ripped apart'. He said: 'She was 21-years-old and achieving all she had set out to succeed in. 'She was a highly social, well-loved girl who seemed to know everybody. Her popularity is evident when you see the Facebook tributes posted - and the lovely, kind words written.' The hearing also heard that there was no alcohol found in Miss Mackenzie's blood. The coroner said that before the incident in August 2011, the 21-year-old would have seen a warning sign advising motorists of a loose surface and recommending a 10mph maximum speed. The coroner said: 'At what speed she approached the bend the evidence I have heard doesn't say but my impression is she went into that bend at a speed in excess of 10mph. Friends: Melissa Mackenzie (right) pictured with her twin sister Sarah (left), who she had enjoyed dinner with before the incident in August 2011 .

'The underlying cause of all this is she went in the right-hand bend at a speed that was, with the benefit of hindsight, higher than prudent for the conditions. That made the car go out of control.'

He had complained to police that the gift from a friend was poor quality . With his private education and impeccable pedigree, he should perhaps have grasped the legal aspects of the situation. But aristocrat Robert Oliphant Maxtone-Graham was so aggrieved when his cannabis supply proved substandard that he complained to the police. And as a result, the former government advisor of of Balbeggie, Perthshire, ended up getting arrested himself. Maxtone-Graham was yesterday fined after he admitted being discovered with hundreds of pounds worth of the illicit drug. The 57-year-old, who served on a number of cross-party groups, was arrested after calling the police to his rural cottage over an ongoing spat with another man. He told police he had been given a large lump of cannabis as a gift from a former friend and complained to the officers about its poor quality. His own solicitor even admitted that it was ‘a somewhat unusual case’. Perth Sheriff Court was told that Maxtone-Graham tried to hand the cannabis in to officers at the local police station but was told to go away as they were too busy. The aristocrat, whose family can be traced back to the 13th century, then asked officers to come to his home and showed them an email relating to the drug. He then led the police to his car where he produced a large block of cannabis resin. Maxtone-Graham admitted possessing cannabis worth almost £600 at his home between September 6 and October 2 last year and was fined £360. Fiscal depute Rebecca Kynaston said: ‘Whilst the police were making inquiries, it became clear there were controlled drugs within the property.’ Solicitor Jamie Morris, defending, said: ‘It is somewhat unusual. The expression that comes to mind when you look at the circumstances is that it was an “own goal”. A file picture of cannabis resin. Maxtone Graham's block was estimated to be worth almost £600 . ‘He was in touch with a then relatively close friend. That friend indicated he had some cannabis he did not want and he offered it to Mr Maxtone-Graham. ‘The substance arrived and it became clear it was of extremely poor quality. ‘He did persevere and use some of it but he then fell out with the friend. As a strategy of getting back at his friend, he contacted police. ‘Had he not volunteered the information to police there’s probably no chance at all this would have seen the light of day. ‘The prospect of him troubling the authorities again are very modest. The circumstances are very unusual in my experience.’ ‘The substance arrived and it became clear it was of extremely poor quality. ‘He did persevere and use some of it but he then fell out with the friend.

The inquest heard that on September 22, Mr Le Berre and Mr Sandeman had jumped from the same plane. Experienced: Patrick Sandeman, 53, had taken part in 677 jumps and loved skydiving . Devastated: Katie Sandeman and her son (right) leave her husband's inquest in Huntingdon today . The airfield was busy that day and there was little wind. Their jumps were staggered for safety reasons with Mr Le Berre jumping as part of the first group of nine and Mr Sandeman part of a second group of four. Both left the plane at about 14,000ft, reaching speeds of up to 200mph in freefall before deploying their parachutes between 5,000ft and 2,500ft. Giving evidence, Mr Le Berre, who had completed 488 jumps, said he was slowing after performing an advanced 'swooping' manoeuvre - involving a sudden turn and increase in speed - when he saw Mr Sandeman below him. Programmer Mr Le Berre, 28, originally from France but now living in London, said he remembered pulling on his brakes but could not prevent his knees hitting Mr Sandeman's canopy and tangling their parachute lines. Mr Wilson-Roberts told the inquest that swooping turns created unpredictable landing patterns and made it more difficult for skydivers to predict one another's movements. When a tape of Mr Sandeman's (left) last jump was played to an inquest, his wife left the coroner's court . He was part of Mr Sandeman's group and captured a video of the jump using a head camera. It showed the early stages of the jump unfolding uneventfully before the camera lost sight of Mr Sandeman. Mr Sandeman's wife and son left the inquest as this was played to the inquest. 'It was only when I landed and was alerted by my wife that I found out they had collided,' Mr Wilson-Roberts said. 'When I arrived at the accident scene, Pat was laying there completely silent and Matt on his side facing him. 'It was quickly established that Pat wasn't alive and we needed to do CPR.' Outside the inquest, solicitor Dominic Fairclough read a statement on behalf of Mr Sandeman's family. He said: 'Patrick was an incredibly loving husband and father who lived life to the full. 'The only positive outcome from this has been Mr Le Berre's recovery.'

A father told how he feared that his 'hero' son wanted to kill him and his wife the day before the couple were shot dead at their home, a court heard today. Pensioner Bob Seddon, 68, began to suspect that a earlier car crash into a canal was an attempt by his son Stephen, 46, to kill him and his wife Patricia, 65. He had planned to confront his son with his fears on the afternoon before the couple were killed but the meeting never took place, Manchester Crown Court was told. Bob and Patricia Seddon were been found dead in what was at first a suspected murder-suicide. Their son, Stephen, 46, right, is on trial over their deaths . The court heard Bob Seddon, 68, suspected that a earlier car crash into a canal was an attempt by his son . to kill him and his wife Patricia, 65 . Tragic: The couple's bodies were discovered after a neighbour raised the alarm and police broke into their house in Manchester . He confided his fears to his doctor . only the day before the couple were gunned down with a sawn-off shot gun . at their semi detached home in Sale, Greater Manchester in July last . year. The jury at Manchester Crown Court has . been told that Stephen Seddon was hailed a hero for trying to rescue . his parents from the wreckage of a hired BMW which he had driven into a . canal in March. Seddon claimed the crash into the . Bridgewater canal in Timperley was an accident and was portrayed as the 'saviour' of the elderly couple in newspaper and television reports. Prosecutor Peter Wright QC claimed . that Seddon - known to his parents as Nic - plotted their murder to get . his hands on his £230,000 inheritance as the sole beneficiary of their . joint wills. Health problems: Patricia Seddon was left unconscious after the crash, and was rushed to a nearby hospital . Suffering: The couple narrowly escaped tragedy in March after their car plunged into Bridgewater Canal . Hard times: The couple had both suffered health issues and lost their daughter three years ago . He told the jury: 'The day . before the murders Mr Seddon had an appointment with his GP. He . expressed the view that the canal incident was not an accident. 'He expressed his concern that it was . his belief that his son had tried to kill him and his wife when he had . driven the car into the canal. 'He gave a number of reasons for this . belief. He was due to see his son later that day and he was intending . to confront him about it but no meeting appear to have taken place.' Mr Wright said that Seddon had taken . his wife and two of their children to a caravan park in Fleetwood, . Lancashire, at the time of the murders but had driven back to their home . in Seaham, County Durham. He made a call to someone who has . convictions for firearms offences and then borrowed his brother in law's . car which he drove to Sale. The car was tracked by roadside cameras travelling from Seaham to the Sale area and then back again to the North East. Mr Wright said there was a 21 minute . window between the car arriving in the Sale area and then being picked . up by camera leaving in the opposite direction. He said the bodies of the couple were . found two days later after neighbours raised concerns with the police . who broke into the house. Mr Wright said that scene had been . made to look like a murder-suicide with the gun being placed upon Mr . Seddon's lap with his right hand on the weapon. Investigation: Prosecutors said the scene had been . made to look like a murder-suicide . But forensic and ballistics reports . were 'entirely inconsistent' with the proposition and it would have . been impossible for Mr Seddon to have shot himself from the position in . which he was found, he said. Seddon was arrested but made only 'selective' answers to questions. He said it was 'ridiculous' to . claim the canal crash was a murder bid. 'He claimed that someone was trying to set him up and that the police were blinkered,' said Mr Wright. Mr Wright added: 'The evidence . presents a compelling picture which demonstrates overwhelmingly the . single conclusion that Stephen Seddon determined his parents needed to . die. 'Having decided they must do so, he . embarked upon a course of actions which led to their murders and . eventually this court room.' The trial continues.

A funeral director murdered his wife after embarking on an affair with a widow from a nearby village, a court heard yesterday. John Taylor, 61, is alleged to have killed wife Alethea six months into his romance with 53-year-old Alison Dearden. A jury was told that no trace has been found of Mrs Taylor, 63, since she was last seen in January last year. Taylor had told friends his wife had developed ‘some form of dementia’ and vanished. Alethea Taylor (left) who was allegedly murdered by her Funeral Director husband, John Taylor (right) But the court heard their relationship had become strained after she discovered the affair. Mrs Taylor had written that her husband had become ‘besotted with a certain little widow’. The prosecution claims Taylor killed the former teacher and somehow  disposed of her body. Michael Burrows, prosecuting, said Taylor had used the couple’s joint bank account to buy a ‘love nest’, which he was renovating so he could eventually move in with his mistress. Worcester Crown Court heard Mrs Taylor’s blood was discovered on bedding at the couple’s home and on the rear seats of Taylor’s car. The funeral director claimed the blood was from a nose bleed, but a forensic scientist said it had not dripped and probably resulted from direct contact with the sheets. Taylor was also seen vacuuming the boot of his vehicle outside his  home – despite telling police he was somewhere else at the time. Mr Burrows said Taylor claimed his wife was still alive when he left their home in Orleton, Herefordshire, on the morning of January 19. ‘Mr Taylor says she simply disappeared – and that if she is dead, he didn’t kill her,’ he said. The bungalow in Ludlow shared by Alethea Taylor and her husband John Taylor who is on trial at Worcester Crown Court for her murder . The cottage in Brimfield, Ludlow which is the home of Alison Mary Dearden, the mistress of John Taylor . Funeral Director, John Taylor at the old chapel at Leominster Cemetery . Mrs Taylor’s nightdress was missing from the house but her glasses, passport, bank cards and a bracelet were all left behind. Mr Burrows said Taylor was ‘keen to spread around’ the idea she was ‘in some way, losing her mind’ to cover up for her disappearance. He told police he had once found his wife ‘crying and disorientated’ in a lane, but the prosecutor said he had never taken her to see a doctor despite his professed concerns. And Mrs Taylor had not confided in friends about any problems with memory loss, the jury was told. Rita Tetsill said she had known her for 40 years and was ‘gobsmacked’ when Taylor told her his wife was ‘suffering with dementia’. Mrs Tetsill said she had ‘never’ seen anything to make her fear for her friend’s mental health. She added: ‘(Alethea) always sent everyone cards, birthday, anniversary, Easter and New Year she never forgot, but since she went missing I haven’t received one letter.’ Both Mrs Tetsill and a second friend, Eve Martin, told the jury they were surprised when Taylor told them separately his wife had ‘wandered off’ on occasion. The court heard Mrs Taylor’s first marriage ended in the 1980s when her then husband had an affair. After the break-up Mrs Taylor met her future husband. Taylor left his then wife and later moved to a bungalow in Orleton with Mrs Taylor, whom he married in 1996. Taylor denies murder. The trial continues.

Gwen Pryke, 48, was arrested by police yesterday and is expected to serve two months of a four-month sentence for ignoring a court order to vacate the site. Her husband Asa Pryke, 47, was jailed in November and has since been freed. Gwen Pryke, 48, has been jailed for refusing to leave the family's makeshift campsite in Dedham, Essex . Asa and Gwen Pryke at their makeshift campsite in a 'millionaires' row' in leafy Essex . The couple were not jailed together because they have three children, Nicholas, 17, Rohan, 15 and Jody, 13, . The couple are living in caravans and tents on a two-acre site at Dedham, Essex, the backdrop of many Constable paintings. They have been locked in a bitter legal row with Colchester Council since their day nursery business failed, they lost their home in Wormingford, Essex, and they set up camp in July 2011. Mrs Pryke grew up in the village and although she 'owns' the land, they did not have planning permission to set up camp there. The couple are living in caravans and tents on a two-acre site at Dedham, Essex, the backdrop of many Constable paintings . Refusing to move: Asa Pryke with sons, Rohan and Jody, at their home in Dedham . Mrs Pryke grew up in the village and although she 'owns' the land, they did not have planning permission to set up camp there . Gwen Pryke is expected to serve two months of a four-month sentence for ignoring a court order to vacate the site . Despite the jail terms they still refuse to move on or accept council housing offers. Mr Pryke said: 'They came and dragged her away. It would be wrong to say it was unexpected but it was still a surprise. 'One . of the boys got upset and tried to stop them and had to be restrained. The council says we don't own the land but we have been to see a . solicitor who says we do. 'We know some people think we are stupid . for standing our ground and digging our heels in but we never thought it . would come to us having our liberty taken away. Resident in Dedham expressed surprise as police descended yesterday morning. The Pryke family have set up on land . behind a sub station down a footpath, which has since been blocked off . to traffic after they moved onto the site. Police swooped to arrest Gwen Pryke, 48, as neighbours looked on. One, who asked not to be named, said: 'Obviously we all know about it and I understand they have been there a long time now. 'He has been objectionable at times but it hasn't really affected me but it has been bad for those who back onto it. 'I have tried not to get involved but you have got to go with the system we have and can't just do what you want. 'I don't like them being there and you can't just do what you want.' Other neighbours, who also didn't want to be identified, said the family had not caused them any difficulty. 'We kept thinking our country wouldn't treat us like this for trying to have a home for our family on the land.' He said Mrs Pryke will find it difficult in prison but they are determined to stand their ground and she will get through it. The family wanted to build a home on the land, which they claim was left to Mrs Pryke by her father, but planning permission was refused. Mr Pryke said: 'We did push it but now I can't believe it has come to this and we are going to stand our ground. We don't want to be more of the hidden homeless.' They stayed on the land anyway. A bankruptcy order has led to a dispute between whether an insolvency company or the family own the land. Tim Young, councillor responsible for housing, defended the council's position. He said: 'She is spending time in prison not because of a planning dispute but because she is in contempt of court. 'It was a decision of the court to send her to prison not Colchester Council. Or course it is sad it has come to this but they have refused numerous housing offers. 'I am absolutely staggered they would let it have gone this far and I wish they had taken some of the many attempts to give them advice.'","Gwen Pryke arrested yesterday for ignoring court order to vacate site .

Didier Drogba is at the centre of claims that he isn't . eligible to play in the Champions League. The former Chelsea striker made his return in the . competition in Galatasaray's 1-1 draw with Schalke last night. It was the first time he has played in the tournament since . helping the Blues to victory in the final against Bayern Munich last May. Controversial appearance: Didier Drogba controls the ball during the 1-1 draw between Galatasaray and Schalke in Istanbul last night . New arrival: Drogba touches down at Ataturk Airport in Istanbul to sign for Galatasaray earlier this month . Champion: Drogba celebrates with the European Cup in Munich last May . But he is now facing claims that he should not have been . allowed on the pitch to face the Germans. Schalke are now considering whether to appeal but did not go . into detail over their specific grievance. A club statement read: 'There are doubts about the validity . of the permission to play for Drogba in the Champions League. Schalke 04 . reserves its rights and is looking into this.' Drogba signed for Galatasaray earlier this year from Chinese . side Shanghai Shenhua - just six months after quitting Chelsea. He is on an 18-month loan deal at the Turkish giants and is . bidding to guide them to European glory along with Dutch ace Wesley Sneijder. The controversy relates to the Ivorian's former club in China, Shanghai Shenhua, challenging Drogba's move to Galatasaray. Shenhua officials previously claimed the Champions League winner remains under contract with them and it seems that Schalke are willing to test that argument with UEFA. Shanghai Shenhua, who he joined from Chelsea last summer, issued a statement on their website earlier this month describing themselves as 'deeply shocked' by the announcement, and insisting Drogba remains under contract in China. 'We understand that Drogba is eager to participate in the European Champions League,' the statement read. 'Shanghai . Shenhua Football Club and Drogba on July 1, 2012 officially signed a . formal contract for a period of two and a half years. The club has acted . in accordance with this contract, and has effectively fulfilled the . responsibilities and obligations of the club. In the thick of it: Drogba challenges Schalke goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand on Wednesday night . 'Drogba is still a . player of Shanghai Shenhua Football Club, the contract between the two . parties is still within the period of validity. 'Shanghai Shenhua . is prepared to collate all the evidence and information and submit it to . FIFA in order to protect its interests.' Drogba, speaking . through his representatives Sports PR Company on Twitter, said at the . time of his signing for the Turkish giants: 'The opportunity to play for . this great club was an offer that I could not turn down. 'I am looking forward to playing in the Champions League again, against the best clubs in Europe.' UEFA rules stipulate that players must be registered with their club by February 1, if they are to feature in the knockout stages of the Champions League. Schalke sports director Horst Heldt and finance chief Peter Peters confirmed they would appeal. 'It would be negligent not to have it checked,' Heldt said. Peters said: 'There is the suspicion that he received his eligibility after the end of the deadline to register the player for the UEFA Champions League. 'Before each game UEFA states that every club has to take responsibility for the players used. It is now up to UEFA to decide and Schalke will respect this process.' Jermaine Jones' strike in the last minute . of the first half gave Schalke a slight advantage in Istanbul. Jones calmly slotted home after Jefferson Farfan had squared the ball to . him to give the German side a vital draw at the Turk Telekom Arena, . although Schalke's goalscorer will miss the second leg after picking up a . booking. Rough and tumble: Drogba (right) wrestles with Schalke defender Benedikt Howedes at the Ali Samiyen stadium . Burak Yilmaz had earlier put Gala in front with a piece of individual . brilliance but they could not extend their lead in a breathtaking . first-half in which both teams failed to convert several glorious . opportunities. The second half was less open, although Yilmaz nearly gave the . hosts a slender lead heading into the second leg but could only fire . wide of the target. Drogba and Wesley Sneijder both made their returns to . the Champions League after completing recent moves to Gala from Shanghai Shenhua . and Inter Milan respectively. But it was Yilmaz who produced a moment of magic worthy of either of the pair when he broke the deadlock in sparkling fashion. The forward collected the ball from Selcuk Inan on the edge of the area . before flicking over Schalke defender Benedikt Howedes with his heel and . wonderfully firing into the roof of the net in the 12th minute. It was a sickening blow for the visitors, who had seen Gala keeper . Fernando Muslera make fine saves from both Jones and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar . in the opening minute. Top Drog: the former Chelsea ace showboats during last night's 1-1 draw . Nevertheless they nearly levelled almost immediately after Yilmaz's . brilliance, but Huntelaar just failed to connect with Howedes' flick-on . from Farfan's corner. And in an increasingly open first half, they were nearly made to pay . when Howedes fired against the bar with the goal gaping after Drogba had . seen his left-footed strike fingertipped away by Schalke goalkeeper . Timo Hildebrand. It was the German side who nearly scored next though, with Semih Kaya . deflecting Farfan's cutback wide of his own post, while the influential . Schalke striker struck over on the turn despite being given plenty of . space in the area. Both sides seemed to view attack as the best form of defence and Drogba, . who was making a nuisance of himself in Schalke's backline, played in . Yilmaz but he could not lift his effort over Hildebrand. Row: Drogba's former club Shanghai Shenhua say he broke his contract to join Galatasaray . Yet Schalke drew level on the stroke of half-time courtesy of United . States midfielder Jones, who will miss the second leg after picking . up a booking for dissent. Farfan burst through on goal after Gala had given the ball away in . midfield and squared for the free Jones and he calmly struck past . Muslera. It was a far more subdued affair after the interval although Schalke did . have a decent penalty appeal turned down when Farfan's fierce strike . looked to have cannoned off Sabri Sarioglu's hands, which were raised to . his chest. It was not until late on that the game sprang back into life, with . Yilmaz shooting across the face of goal from Drogba's inch-perfect . flick-on while Sarioglu's half-volley from the edge of the area was . tipped over by Hildebrand. And Gala's efforts to push for a winner nearly backfired completely . when, at the other end, Julian Draxler dribbled to the edge of their box . unchecked before shooting inches wide of Muslera's right-hand post.","Germans poised to challenge legality of striker's move from China to Turkey .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:09 EST, 21 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:09 EST, 21 February 2013 . Convicted NYPD cop killer Ronell Wilson had a sex act done to him by his girlfriend with his mother and sister in the room, a source has revealed . The convicted cop killer who impregnated a female prison guard while incarcerated has more dirty secrets, it was revealed today. Ronell Wilson, who was convicted in 2006 of killing an undercover NYPD detective, was pleasured from another girlfriend ahead of his incarceration while his mother and sister were in the visiting room, sources revealed. The source said that mother Depetra Wilson and Vanessa Warrick turned away while Wilson was receiving the sex act, and that the salacious event was captured on prison surveillance camera. The source told the New York Daily News that prosecutors considered using the footage against Wilson in his case to try and get the death penalty. The feds were hoping to illustrate the 30-year-old man’s blatant disregard for authority and the fact that he posed a danger to himself and others while behind bars. Wilson will be sentenced sometime this spring in Brooklyn Federal Court. Court papers show that former prison guard, Nancy Gonzalez, is eight-and-a-half months pregnant with their son, and faces 15 years in prison if convicted for having sex with Wilson. The convicted killer impregnated a prison guard in an . alleged plot to avoid the death penalty had been so desperate to father a child . that he offered to confess to the murders of two detectives, according to his . former lawyer. Illegal liaison: Federal prison guard Nancy Gonzalez, left, was arrested after police say she had an illicit affair with convicted cop killer Ronell Wilson, right, and became pregnant with his baby to save him from execution . Attorney Ephraim Savitt said that in 2006, his then-client . Ronell Wilson was poised to accept a plea deal as part of which he would accept . responsibility for the 2003 slayings of undercover detectives Rodney Andrews . and James Nemorin and be sentenced to a life in prison. 'Wilson advised me that he would take the life deal — as . long as he could have conjugal visits — because he was determined to leave this . earth with a child of his own, to give his wasted life some meaning, Savitt . told the New York Post. For Wilson to be . allowed to meet with women behind . bars, he would have had to be sent to a state prison, but his former . attorney . said that the negotiations with the prosecution never went that far . because Attorney general Alberto Gonzalez rejected the proposed . agreement. Wilson's former prison guard-turned-paramour Nancy Gonzalez, 29, . was arrested last month for having an illicit affair with him and getting pregnant . with his child in an alleged scheme to help him escape the death penalty. Sources told The New York Post that during his try with . Gonzalez last year, Wilson was also placing 'romantic' phone calls with three . other women from behind bars. In the aftermath of Gonzalez’s arrest on suspicion that she . had hatched a plot with Wilson to help save his life, the father of one of the . slain officers, Rodney Andrews, spoke out against the idea that his son's . killer should be shown leniency just because he got the woman pregnant. 'Put him to death for what he did,' Rodney Andrews Sr told New . York Daily News. 'If he had 20 children, it wouldn't change my mind.' The 72-year-old father went on to say that Ms Gonzalez does . not deserve any mercy either. Change of heart: On her MySpace page, Gonzalez summed up her attitude toward children thus: 'Love kids, but not for me' On her Facebook page, Gonzalez posted a photo depicting herself proudly showing off her swollen pregnant belly in a tight yellow T-shirt with the world 'Love' printed across the front. Expecting: Former prison guard Nancy Gonzalez poses on Facebook, showing off her baby bump as she prepares to give birth to the child of convicted cop killer Ronell Wilson . Interestingly enough, on her MySpace page, the 29-year-old described her attitude towards children thus: 'Love kids, but not for me.' Gonzalez was arrested Tuesday on . charges she intentionally had sex with Ronell Wilson while working the . night shift at the Metropolitan Detention Center, which is against the . law. She became pregnant in June, a few months into the affair, . according to court papers. Wilson . was a young gang member when he was convicted in the point-blank . shootings of two undercover officers in an illegal gun sting gone awry. ‘I took a chance because I was so vulnerable and wanted to be loved and now I am carrying his child,’ Gonzalez said, according to court papers. Wilson was sentenced to death in the killing of officers Rodney Andrews and James Nemorin, but the sentence was thrown out in 2010 by an appeals court. A new jury must decide his fate. But . replay of the trial's penalty phase has been put off as Wilson's lawyers . seek to convince a judge that he's ineligible for the death penalty . because he is mentally disabled. According . to a complaint, Wilson and Gonzales' scheme to help the convicted . killer escape capital punishment was revealed by prison informants. Victims: Detectives James Nemorin, left, and Rodney Andrews, right, were gunned down by Wilson during a drug bust gone awry in Staten Island in 2003 . Legal complications: Wilson's death sentence was thrown out after an appeals court found that a prosecutor had vilified the convicted killer . According . to one inmate, he witnessed the 29-year-old female guard moving away . from Wilson's cell door while he was standing there with his pants down. The complaint made public Tuesday and cited by CBS New York stated that the inmate and guard had sex in a vacant activity room while Gonzalez was supposed to be checking up on prisoners. The two were caught on video talking or hours at her desk in the kitchen. Military career: Before taking a job as a federal corrections officer, Gonzalez served in the U.S. Army . One of many: While carrying on an affair with Gonzalez, pictured, Wilson was allegedly wooing three other women from behind bars . The corrections officer came clean about her affair with Wilson, which lasted between March and August 2012, in a taped phone conversation with her boyfriend, who is serving time in a state prison. Gonzalez allegedly said she 'kind of got sucked into his world' and 'why not give him a child as far as giving him some kind of hope. 'I can’t explain it. I know what’s to come. I know what is going to be said about me,' Gonzalez allegedly said. 'I know that for me as a parent, how am I going to explain this to this little boy?' It remains unknown what effect the uncovered plot will have on Wilson's mental retardation claim. He still faces life in prison or death by lethal injection. 'If this was done by design, it's not the actions of a person who is mentally retarded,' said Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives Endowment Association. 'It's a devious plot to avoid the death penalty.'

It was reported that the 37-year-old eats the pot cookies at home when she is in sole care of her 14 children, and believes they are not at risk when she has ingested the drug. Octomom, Nadya Suleman, who reportedly makes herself marijuana cookies, was seen at a McDonald's drive-thru in Los Angeles on Wednesday . Sources told TMZ Nadya . got the card 2 days after leaving rehab for Xanax addiction and bakes the marijuana products both at home and on the road during media appearances, but not when her nannies are present. There is no suggestion her children have ever been fed the pot-filled treats, but their diet may not be described as the healthiest either. Last week she was pictured  in Los Angeles taking her kids for a McDonald's drive-thru for breakfast . Hiding her eyes behind a pair of shades, Nadya appeared to be wearing a grey hooded top as she let her dark hair fall at her shoulders.

Cara Delevingne has been the toast of London Fashion Week after gracing the catwalk for designers Burberry, Matthew Williamson and Mulberry - to name but a few - and landing her first British Vogue cover this month. With a number of lucrative modelling contracts under belt and the accolade of Model of the Year from the British Fashion Awards, the style pack have been hailing her as the new Kate Moss since she signed for the same agency, Storm, in 2009. But the 20-year-old famed for her bushy eyebrows recently told Vogue UK that her rise to become model of the moment has come as something as a shock to her - and she 'can't believe' she's so in demand in the world of fashion. Runway star: Cara Delevingne at London Fashion Week for Burberry, left, and Matthew Williamson, right . In demand: The model with designer Daniella Helayel at the Issa London show . 'My mum was into fashion and so . were my two sisters. I was never as into it as much but there would . always be magazines around the house and I would stare at them and be . like 'what is this?' I never understood it, fashion was very alien thing . to me,' she said. Already photogenic: Cara as a baby . With a love of drumming and fan of . dressing down in onesies and beanies, she could come across as an . unlikely super star to those uninitiated to the Delevingne family. For as Alison Boshoff wrote in Daily Mail last year: 'Apart from her beauty, there is another thing which Delevingne likes to play down: her status as a high-society sweetheart. 'For while Moss is from Croydon, and Naomi Campbell from Streatham, Delevingne hails from Chelsea, via Belgravia.' On her mother, Pandora's, side, Cara's grandfather is the former English Heritage chairman Sir Jocelyn . Stevens, founder of the 1960s pirate radio station Radio Caroline. Meanwhile her father Charles, a property-developer, had a grandfather who was a politician (Hamar, . 1st Viscount Greenwood) and his aunt, Doris Delevingne, was a society . beauty who was friends with Winston Churchill. With her parent's social standing, Cara and her older sisters Chloe and Poppy became accustomed to rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous from a young age. Joan Collins is Cara's godmother while their mother's friendship with Sarah Ferguson meant they also became close to Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. They were all privately educated with Cara attending Frances Holland School for Girls near Sloane Square then the boarding school Bedales. It was while she was at school her potential to become a supermodel was clocked by Sarah Doukas, the CEO of Storm Model Mangagement who once plucked Moss from obscurity. Her daughter happened to be Cara's best friend. Privileged background: With her older sisters, Poppy, left, also a model, and Chloe, who were all privately educated at Britain's top schools . As Cara revealed to the Telegraph: 'I've been best-friends with Genevieve . Garner, daughter of Sarah Doukas since I . was five. Sarah saw me when she came to our school and Gen introduced . us. I had never thought about modelling before, and it just happened.' Doukas also marked Cara's older sister Poppy for success and her modelling career took off first. While Cara did the odd modelling job in her youth, Storm didn't officially sign her until 2009, when she was aged 17. By that time Poppy, six years her senior, had already made a name for herself and had starred in campaigns for Anya Hindmarch, Agent Provocateur, Diesel, Chanel and Louis Vuitton. Cara's break out campaign was for Burberry where she posed alongside another rising star - Les Mis actor Eddie Redmayne. She then became the face of Burberry in 2012. Rising stars: One of her first campaigns was for Burberry with actor Eddie Redmayne . Work with Zara, Victoria's Secret and H&M followed as well as taking to the runway for designers including Stella McCartney and becoming a magazine cover star. Now everywhere the model goes, cameras are sure to follow, as she parties with her friends such as Rihanna and Rita Ora and is usually happy to strike a kooky pose. Speculation on her love life is also rife with rumored romances with One Direction's Harry Styles and musician Jake Bugg. Carmen Borgonovo, fashion director at online boutique my-wardrobe.com explains Cara's appeal: 'She has this unique striking look, which is almost part Brigitte Bardot, but then mixed with an elfin quirkiness. There's a rarity about her look, which has put her on the map and into countless campaigns and runways.' Kooky: When not working, the 20-year-old is known for her dressed down style and larking around . Meanwhile Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman described her as: 'One of those girls who combine energy, wit, enthusiasm and the kind of edgy beauty that marks her out from the general pool of beautiful models.' But while she's currently the most sought after face in fashion, Cara has admitted she has other ambitions - acting. So while for now she's dominating catwalks and covers, it might not be long till she's also a regular on the silver screen.

Oscar Pistorius will be tested for steriods after the banned drugs were allegedly found in his house after he shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Police are also reported to have recovered a bloodied bat from the Paralympic champion’s bedroom and to have established that model Miss Steenkamp’s skull had been ‘crushed’. There was also evidence of heavy drinking before the shooting took place at 3am on Valentine's Day, reports The Sun. South African police are investigating whether Oscar Pistorius beat his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp unconscious with a cricket bat before shooting her after a bloodied bat was reportedly found at his home . Police are investigating whether Pistorius, nicknamed 'Blade Runner', was in the grip of 'roid rage' - the side-effect of taking large quantities of the drug - when he pulled the trigger. His blood samples are being tested and a source told The Sun: 'Steroid drugs were found at Pistorius’s home together with evidence of heavy drinking. That’s why police have specifically ordered that he be tested for steroids.' Meanwhile, the bat and other evidence – a smashed . bathroom door, a 9mm pistol, the peculiar pattern of wounds on the body . and reports of a row earlier in the evening – is said to have led police . to believe the murder case against the sprinter is ‘rock solid’. Miss Steenkamp, 29, was shot four times early on Thursday at Pistorius’s luxury home in a secure housing estate on the outskirts of Pretoria. Police have rubbished speculation that Pistorius – who is known to have kept a pistol by his bed and a machine gun at his bedroom window – may have mistaken his girlfriend of three months for an intruder. Prosecutors have formally charged Pistorius with premeditated murder but his family say he firmly denies such a charge. Yesterday it emerged that he called his close friend Justin Divaris shortly after the killing – reportedly before the emergency services were alerted – and told him: ‘There has been a terrible accident, I shot Reeva.’ Pistorius, pictured in court, called close friend Justin Divaris after the killing and said 'God take me away' Mr Divaris rushed to the house, where he said Pistorius repeatedly told him: ‘My baba, I’ve killed my baba. God take me away.’ While . no officials would comment publicly on the case, a disturbing – though . disputed – picture of what may have happened in Pistorius’s home started . to emerge. Neighbours . have said they heard shouting coming from the house at around 1.30am. There were some suggestions, quickly denied, that the row may have been . about Miss Steenkamp’s friendship with a rugby player. At around 3.20am, four shots rang out – apparently not all at once. The first person Pistorius called was his father Henke, 59. When he arrived, he allegedly saw his son carrying his nightie-clad girlfriend down the stairs. She had been shot in the head, hip, . arm and hand. Pistorius – and later paramedics – struggled in vain to . save Miss Steenkamp’s life. Police reportedly found the bloodied . cricket bat in the bedroom. The en-suite bathroom door was riddled with . holes, a pistol holster was found by Pistorius’s bed and a gun cartridge . was on the floor. South Africa’s City Press quoted an . unnamed police source as saying: ‘The suspicion is that the first shot, . in the bedroom, hit her in the hip. She then ran and locked herself in . the toilet. ‘She was doubled over because of the . pain. He fired three more shots. She probably covered her head, which is . why the bullet also went through her hand.’ Rugby star Francois Hougaard's agent said the 'sad ordeal' was nothing to do with him in response to rumours that had circulated about the nature of the Springbok's friendship with Miss Steenkamp . The source said police are carrying out tests to establish whose blood is on the bat. While one scenario is that Pistorius . attacked Miss Steenkamp with the wooden bat, it has also been claimed . that the model may have used it to defend herself. A third possibility is that Pistorius . used it to break down the bathroom door. Those close to Pistorius have . suggested that he may done so in a bid to ‘save’ his dying girlfriend. According to this theory, the athlete . first shot Miss Steenkamp by accident, whereupon she fled to the . bathroom. He then shot at the door lock to try to get in, accidentally . killing her. Pistorius’s father appeared to suggest it is this version that he believes. While he admitted that he had not . talked to his son in detail about what happened, he said he had ‘zero . doubt’ that the sportsman thought Miss Steenkamp was an intruder. A more likely defence from Pistorius is to acknowledge that there was a row but that he did not intend to kill her. Blade Runner: Pistorius ran in both the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics last year . Some in South Africa have speculated . about the nature of Miss Steenkamp’s friendship with Springbok rugby . player Francois Hougaard, and whether this played a part in the tragedy. The 24-year-old was keen to distance . himself from such reports at the weekend. His agent said: ‘This whole . sad ordeal has got nothing to do with him.’ Last night Pistorius’s agent said he had withdrawn him  from all planned races but insisted his sponsors were sticking by him. The tragedy has also cast fresh light on Pistorius’s apparent attraction to danger and weaponry. Miss Steenkamp's father Barry wept as he said he and his wife June were at 'a complete loss' As well as owning a pistol and . machine gun, at the time of Miss Steenkamp’s death he reportedly had . seven outstanding firearm licence applications. One was for same type of assault rifle used in the recent Sandy Hook school massacre in the US. Pistorius, who was charged with . premeditated murder at a court appearance on Friday, spent the weekend . in a police cell ahead of a second hearing planned for tomorrow at which . his lawyers are expected to ask for bail.

Prosecution lawyers in the Jodi Arias murder trial have challenged the defendant over phone records and diary entries they say contradict her claims her boyfriend was a pedophile. Arias, who maintains she was acting in self-defense when she shot Travis Alexander and stabbed him 27 times, has said she walked in on Mr Alexander looking at photographs of young boys. The defendant has said during her testimony that she fled in disgust. Prosecution lawyers have now pressed her to explain why phone records show five calls between the couple on the same day she allegedly ran away in horror. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . One-on-one: Prosecutor Juan Martinez (left) aggressively questioned Jodi Arias (right) on the first day of the prosecution's turn during the ongoing murder trial on Thursday . Prosecutor Juan Martinez also pointed out that Arias and Mr Alexander exchanged text messages throughout the afternoon and evening at the time Arias claims she found her partner looking at the photographs. Arias stuck by her earlier testimony, according to an ABC News report. The prosecution had started their portion . of the Jodi Arias murder trial on Thursday by aggressively questioning . her about different stories that they believe she lied about on the . stand. They used her own journal entries to . argue that she lied about a specific explicit sex romp with boyfriend . Travis Alexander that involved Tootsie pops and Pop Rocks. Mr Martinez went on to attack her scandalous claims that Mr Alexander was sexually . attracted to young boys, examining the timeline of the texts that they . sent one another on the day that she supposedly walked in on him . pleasuring himself to pictures of minors. The supposed incident took place months before Arias shot and stabbed Alexander, killing him reportedly in self defense. Earlier in the trial during her questioning by her defense attorney, Arias said that the reason she missed her friend Lonnie Dworkin's baptism was because she and Alexander were having sex and using the candy as props. Mr Martinez was verbally sparring with Arias as he pushed her to look at her own journal entries where she gave an alternate reason for missing Mr Dworkin's baptism. In doing so, Mr Martinez is likely planning on showing that Arias lied about her sex life with Mr Alexander to the court, bringing into question what else she lies about. At one point, he focused on her 'selective memory' because he said that she said she didn't recall certain points from the trial but was 'able to remember the drink you ordered from Starbucks five years ago'. Grilled: Martinez asks Arias a question about her diary during cross examination in Maricopa County Superior Court today in Phoenix, Arizona . 'You can tell us what kind of sex you had with Mr Alexander many years ago but you can't remember what you said yesterday or a few days ago?' he said during his quick succession of questions. She admitted that she had trouble with her memory when she was under stress. Another issue that he addressed during the first portion of the questioning was the timeline surrounding her damaged finger. Earlier in the trial, she stated that she and Mr Alexander got in a physical altercation in January 2008 when he threw her on the floor and allegedly kicked her in the ribs and finger. She told the court that she didn't want to see a doctor for fear of getting Mr Alexander in trouble so they made a makeshift splint, but the finger- her left ring finger- did not heal and is still damaged to this day. Mr Martinez showed a journal entry that was made after the alleged fight and it made no reference to the fight. He also showed a picture that was taken months after the fight where her hand does not appear damaged. After the fact: The picture on the screen was taken months after she was supposedly kicked by Alexander when he allegedly damaged her finger, but her finger does not look damaged in the picture . Alternate story: The court was also shown video of an interrogation when she told an investigator that fictitious intruders attacked her and caused the hand injury . He also used a videotaped interview . that she had with Detective Esteban Flores who was investigating Mr . Alexander's murder where she said that her finger was damaged on June 4- . the night that she killed Mr Alexander. At that time, however, she was . making up a story about how two intruders broke into Mr Alexander's . home, attacking and killing him. 'Whatever you told us in the past is somewhat suspect,' Mr Martinez said in court. Much of the afternoon was spent parsing over the texts that Mr Alexander and Arias exchanged on the day when she alleged that she caught him pleasuring himself while looking at pictures of young boys. That allegedly occurred on January 21, 2008. The next day, she claims they had the violent altercation that she says resulted in her left ring finger being damaged. One of the main points of Mr Martinez' inquiry is her personal journal, where two days after the alleged fight and three days after the supposed discovery of Mr Alexander's alleged sexual interest in boys, she wrote: 'I haven't written because there is nothing noteworthy to report.' The prosecution comes after eight days where Arias was questioned about her relationship and eventual murder of Mr Alexander. The . questioning style was predictably nicer during that time than it was . today, however, since it was her defense attorney Kirk Nurmi doing the . asking. Her story: Arias' defense is based entirely around the fact that she killed Alexander in self-defense- which she tearfully told the court on Wednesday- and that she lied multiple times to investigators because she was trying to avoid jail . Contemplation: Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi was a much more gentle questioner when he examined Arias . Wednesday was arguably most explosive day of her murder trial, when Arias testified that there was a 'huge gap' in her memory from June 4, 2008 - the day that Alexander died at his Mesa, Arizona home. Arias told jurors that she and Alexander had been taking naked pictures in his shower when she dropped his camera, causing him to erupt in a rage, body-slamming her against the tiles and threatening to kill her. She went on to say that she does not remember stabbing him 27 times but does remember 'accidentally' shooting him. The trial continues.

Ten of Princess Diana's most iconic dresses that her son William persuaded her to part with for charity are set to fetch up to £830,000 at auction. They include the Saturday Night Diva creation that Diana wore when she memorably danced with John Travolta at a White House ball in 1985. The Victor Edelstein midnight-blue silk velvet outfit became the most famous dress ever worn by Diana and is valued at up to £300,000. Saturday Night Fever: The iconic Saturday Night Diva creation that Diana wore when she memorably danced with John Travolta at a White House ball in 1985 is on auction . A Catherine Walker pink silk evening gown made for Diana's State visit to India in 1992 is tipped to raise up to £120,000. There are five other glamorous Catherine Walker evening gowns up for grabs; another by Victor Edelstein; a Bruce Oldfield black velvet gown; and a Zandra Rhodes white chiffon cocktail dress. Kerry Taylor Auctions, which is staging the sale in Bermondsey, south-east London on March 19, has hailed the collection of dresses as 'fabulous and historic'. The Princess wore the Mughal-inspired Catherine Walker pink silk gown by Lord Snowdon in 1997 . At the time of the White House ball thrown by President Reagan, Diana was the world's most famous woman. First Lady Nancy Reagan quietly took Grease heartthrob Travolta aside and whispered that Diana wanted to dance with him. He later recalled how he crossed the dance floor at midnight and approached her. He said: 'She turned around and she did that look that she did so, so beautifully and I asked if she would care to dance and she said she'd love to and we danced for twenty minutes to a medley of Grease and Saturday Night Fever. 'I was on cloud nine. She has great rhythm. We did spins and turns. We did a kind of modern fox-trot and she followed me very well. '""Maybe some day we'll get to do this in a less-watched situation"", I said near the end. ""That would be great"", she replied.' He described the experience as being like a fairytale'. A Catherine Walker gown that the late Princess wore in 1991 will also be going on auction at Kerry Taylor auction house . Diana wore the same Victor Edelstein gown on several more major occasions - on State visits to Vienna and Bonn, to the Royal Opera House in 1991, when she met Vivienne Westwood, and for an official portrait by artist Israel Zohar in 1990.

The Princess was also photographed wearing the Mughal-inspired Catherine Walker pink silk gown by Lord Snowdon in 1997. Richly embroidered with layered pink sequins and amber, green and pink crystal beads, it is one of the most lavish of all her gowns.

Shortly before her death in a Paris car crash, Diana raised almost £2million for her favourite charities by selling 79 couture creations at an auction at Christie's in New York. In the catalogue notes to the 1997 sale, Diana wrote: 'The inspiration for this wonderful sale comes from just one person; our son William.'

'Non-stop shouting' was heard coming from Oscar Pistorius' home before his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp was shot dead, his bail hearing was told today. Model Miss Steenkamp, aged 29, was shot three times in her arm, hip and head. Police claimed two containers of testosterone and needles were also found in the bedroom but Pistorius' lawyer Barry Roux said it was not testosterone but a herbal remedy. The details were revealed as the second day of the 26-year-old athlete's bail hearing began at Pretoria Magistrates' Court. Scroll down for video . Back in court: Oscar Pistorius on second day of bail hearing . VIDEO Pistorius arrives at court two hours early for second day of bail hearing . Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said the prosecution team had a witness who heard shouting coming from the property at the exclusive Silver Lakes Golf Estate between 2am and 3am. Shortly afterwards Miss Steenkamp lay bleeding to death in Pistorius's bathroom hit by three bullets, one in the head, the hip and arm, Pretoria Magistrates' Court heard. Pistorius has admitted shooting her with a 9mm pistol but said he thought a burglar or burglars were in the bathroom and he did not intend to shoot the model. The athlete has said he believed intruders were in his house so he fired through the bathroom door in the dark as he was too scared to turn the light on. Discovering his mistake, he broke the door down with a cricket bat and carried her downstairs, he has said. Under cover: A TV crew film Pistorius arriving at court with a blanket over his head . But today, the second day of his bail . application, investigating officer Hilton Botha said the prosecution . also have a witness who said the lights were on after hearing gunshots. Lawyers and police studied plans of the bedroom and bathroom. A projector was used to beam the plans up for the public and press to see. Mr Botha said there was 'no way' he believed Pistorius's version of events. The runner has said he shot through the door while on his stumps but the . court heard the bullets' trajectory was through the top of the door. Mr Botha said he believed the bullets were fired down, suggesting that . Pistorius was wearing his prosthetic legs when the shots were . discharged. He said: 'I believe he knew she was in the bathroom and he shot four shots through the door.' The court heard that two mobile phones were seized at the property and neither had been used to call the police or paramedics. The court also heard today that two boxes of testosterone and needles were found in Pistorius's bedroom. And details were released of a row he allegedly had with a man over a . girl at Kyalami racetrack where Pistorius allegedly threatened to 'f*** . up' the rival. It was also claimed he was involved in another shooting at a restaurant . in Johannesburg in January and asked the gun owner to take . responsibility for the incident. Mr Botha said he wanted Pistorius charged additionally with a weapons . violation after unlicensed .38 calibre ammunition was found at the . house. The athlete - who was sobbing this morning in court - made notes with a silver pen as the case progressed. He told officials he had been a victim of crime and received death . threats, but today the court heard there were no records of this. In an affidavit, Pistorius has denied murdering the law graduate at his home in the early hours of Thursday. Family support: Oscar Pistorius' sister Aimee, brother Carl and father Henke in the courtroom on Wednesday . Tragic: Funeral of Reeva Steenkamp was held on Tuesday . He has said they were in love and he thought Miss Steenkamp was in bed when he got up in the dark and blasted through the door. Pistorius's lawyer Barry Roux said it was not testosterone but a herbal remedy discovered in his client's bedroom. Cross-examining Mr Botha, Mr Roux said a post-mortem examination showed Miss Steenkamp's bladder was empty. He said that was consistent with her getting up at 3am to go to the toilet. Mr Roux asked repeatedly why the police did not make simple checks - over the lighting and whether Pistorius had other phones. The lawyer said Pistorius phoned the housing complex manager for help at 3.19am then Netcare hospital a minute later. Mr Roux said the police discarded anything that might have been consistent with a defence. Officers found the victim covered in towels and wearing white shorts and a black top. Prosecutors believe Pistorius, who won two gold medals and a silver at . London's 2012 Paralympic Games, is a flight risk and oppose bail. Mr Botha said Pistorius, who had below-the-knee amputations when . he was 11 months old, has offshore accounts and a property in Italy. Media scrum: Journalists outside the Pretoria Magistrates' Court on Wednesday . Police escort: Pistorius arrives at the Pretoria Magistrates' Court . One witness said he heard a shot, followed 17 minutes later by more shots, Mr Botha said.'One of our witnesses heard a fight, two people talking loudly at each other ... from two in the morning to three,' he said, adding that the witness was about 1,000ft away. Members of the Women's League of the ruling African National Congress protested outside the red-brick court, waving placards saying 'No Bail for Pistorius' and 'Rot in jail'. The case has stunned sports fans worldwide. But it has been felt most acutely in South Africa, where Pistorius was seen as a hero who transcended racial divides that persist nearly 20 years after the end of apartheid. He carried South Africa's flag at the closing ceremony of the London Olympics, and American magazine Sports Illustrated named him as one of the most inspiring figures of the year. The sprinter's endorsements and sponsorships included Nike, telecoms firm BT, sunglasses maker Oakley and French designer Thierry Mugler and were thought to be worth as much as two million US dollars (£1.3 million) a year. Nike and Mugler both said they have dropped Pistorius from advertising campaigns, and Clarins cosmetics firm said it was recalling its A Man perfume range out of 'respect and compassion towards the families involved'. Pistorius' family said in a statement that they were 'satisfied' with Wednesday's court hearing. They said Botha confirmed during cross-examination that the ballistic and forensic evidence was consistent with the defendant's version of events. The family 'trust that everyone has more clarity on this very tragic event', the statement read.But they said contradictions in Botha's evidence were 'extremely concerning'. Arnold Pistorius, the athlete's uncle, said: 'Oscar was not using any drugs listed on the World Anti-Doping Agency banned substances, usage of which would ban him from competing in athletics competitions. 'The IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federations) will have records of every single drugs test that was undertaken in and out of competitions. He has been tested on a number of occasions during the last couple of years and he has never failed a drug test to date.' The hearing was adjourned to tomorrow morning when a decision over bail might be made. The court will resume at 11am in Pretoria (9am GMT).

"By . Kirsty Walker . UPDATED: . 05:19 EST, 5 March 2012 . Cardinal Keith O'Brien has hit out at plans for gay marriage . Britain's most senior Roman Catholic cleric has likened gay marriage to slavery. Cardinal Keith O’Brien, leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland has recently made a series of controversial statements in the media about same sex unions. When interviewed on Radio 4, Cardinal . O'Brien said countries which legalise gay marriage are 'shaming . themselves' by going against the 'natural law.' He also claimed same sex unions were the 'thin end of the wedge' and would lead to the 'further degeneration of society into immorality.' At the weekend Cardinal . O'Brien wrote in newspaper article: . 'Imagine for a moment that the Government had decided to legalise slavery but assured us that ‘no one will be forced to keep a slave’. 'Would such worthless assurances calm our fury? Would they justify dismantling a fundamental human right? Or would they simply amount to weasel words masking a great wrong?' he commented in the Sunday Telegraph. He has also launched a scathing attack on David Cameron’s pledge to legalise homosexual marriage, branding it ‘madness’ and ‘grotesque’. Cardinal O’Brien,accused the Prime Minister of attempting to ‘redefine marriage’ for a ‘small minority of activists’. And he insisted that the reforms would ‘shame the United Kingdom in the eyes of the world.' The Prime Minister is a strong supporter of plans to legalise same-sex marriage, which will be formally unveiled later this month. But the proposal has divided the Conservative Party and put Mr Cameron on a collision course with religious leaders. Cardinal O’Brien said: ‘Since all the legal rights of marriage are already available to homosexual couples, it is clear this proposal is not about rights but rather is an attempt to redefine marriage at the behest of a small minority of activists. ‘If marriage can be redefined so that it no longer means a man and a woman but two men or two women, why stop there? Why not allow three men, or a woman and two men, to constitute a marriage, if they pledge their fidelity to one another?’ David Cameron is a supporter of the plans to legalise gay marriage which will be unveiled by the equalities minister and Lib Dem MP Lynn Featherstone this month . In 2005, civil partnerships were introduced for gay couples but by law they cannot be referred to as marriages. Cardinal O’Brien is the latest among senior clergy to denounce the Government’s backing for marriage to include gay couples. In January, the Anglican Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, insisted governments did not have the moral authority to redefine marriage, and in an article for the Daily Mail last month, Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, wrote: ‘Marriage precedes both the state and the church, and neither of these institutions have the right to redefine it in such a fundamental way.’ The Rev Sharon Ferguson, a pastor of the Metropolitan Community Church, and her partner Franka Strietzel, has fought for same sex marriage . The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, wants to stop gay clergymen becoming bishops . If the law is changed, Britain will . become the seventh European country to recognise same-sex marriage, . after the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Spain, Portugal and Norway. Tory MP Peter Bone, who has called the plans ‘completely nuts’, yesterday suggested the proposals were hatched following a ‘backroom deal’ with the Liberal Democrats. But his colleague Margot James, the first openly lesbian Conservative MP, said: ‘The Government is not trying to force churches to perform gay marriages. It is a purely civil matter.’ Ben Summerskill, of the  gay rights group Stonewall, said: ‘If Roman Catholics don’t approve of same-sex marriage they should make sure they don’t get married to someone of the same sex.’ A Home Office spokesman said the Government believed that a couple should ‘have the option of a civil marriage irrespective of their sexual orientation’.","Cardinal .

The plan would be to try and recreate . some of the magic which Zucker did at NBC in the 1990s when he started . Today on its 16-year run as the number one morning show. That doesn't concern O'Brien, she . claims, because she is excited to be working with him again since they . both started out their careers at NBC. 'He was my boss years ago when I . worked at the 'Today' show. I'm absolutely thrilled to have him back,' she said in an interview with the New York Times. Not concerned: Soledad O'Brien says that she if not getting hung up with the speculation about the expected reshuffle at CNN following Zucker's placement . O'Brien made the switch from NBC to . CNN in 2003 and she has been a part of their morning lineup ever since, . starting with American Morning- then moved on to anchoring specials and . appearing in other segments of the network's line up- and then anchored . Starting Point since January of this year. 'Listen, I have been doing this gig . for a while. People go crazy with speculation every time there’s a shift . in leadership. I can’t comment on every rumor, but so far I’ve read . reports on me, Anderson, Piers, Ann Curry and Erin Burnett, and all . that’s clear to me is that somebody’s busy dialing Page Six,' she said. New talent: Should Zucker make move Burnett, left, to the morning slot, it could . be a slap in the face to Soledad O’Brien, right, who only in January was made . anchor of CNN’s Starting Point, which runs from 7am to 9am . Burnett left NBC and its sister cable networks in 2011, when she was passed over for the Today show co-hosting gig in favor of Ann Curry. Ratings plummeted, Curry was dumped from the program this summer, and NBC replaced Curry with Savannah Guthrie, center left in purple. The Today show has fallen behind ABC since Guthrie joined . Whoever the leaker is, they appear to . have pretty clear expectations for how the reshuffle will fall into . place if Burnett moves to headline a morning show. 'He’ll . team her up with a guy, and they’ll go after the audience watching Today . and Good Morning America,' the unidentified source tells The New York Post. ‘One thing Zucker knows how to do is a morning show.’ Burnett, 36, a former financial . analyst, got her big break on CNBC hosting business show Street Signs . and Squawk on the Street before joining CNN in 2011.

A man whose ribcage was crushing his heart and lungs has been saved after doctors slotted a metal bar through his insides - to fashion a bizarre ‘ribcage brace’. Dale Hay, 25, was born with the unusual . Pectus excavatum - a Latin term meaning hollowed . chest. But ingenious doctors managed to create a ‘brace’ for his ribcage - a foot-long metal bar, which holds his bones in place, protecting his heart and lungs. Dale Hay's ribcage was growing inwards, slowly crushing his heart and lungs. Doctors used a foot-long metal bar to hold the bones in place . And three years after having the bar put in place, doctors are now confident that it can now be removed, and Dale’s ribcage will remain normal. Pub worker Dale, from Atherstone, Warwickshire, said: 'I’ll be really pleased to finally get the bar out, as it can be a bit uncomfortable. 'It protrudes out of my ribcage a bit too, which looks a bit weird - but it has saved my life. 'My mates are always joking that they’re going to sell me off as scrap metal - I don’t know how much they’d get for me though.' The condition, known as Pectus excavatum - a Latin term for hollowed chest - left him struggling to breathe . Although Dale was born with the condition, it didn't develop until his early teens. After struggling to understand why . he was constantly struggling to breathe, Dale tapped his symptoms into . Google - and diagnosed himself with the unusual condition. He added: 'I went to my GP and showed him what I’d found on the internet. I expected him to tell me off for looking up symptoms online and trying to diagnose myself, but instead he sent me to a chest expert. Dale has now been told that he can have the rod removed and is waiting for an operation date . 'I had a scan at Heartlands Hospital, in Birmingham, and they said that my chest was very closed in, and if I wasn’t treated, it would crush my heart. 'They told me they would insert a metal rod into my chest to try and separate my ribs, and force them to grow normally. 'It sounded a bit weird, but it was certainly worth it.' Three and a half years after his original operation, in summer 2010, Dale has now been told that he can have the rod removed. But he has been let down after the operation was cancelled four times - once when he was in his surgical gown. Despite the situation, he refuses to criticise staff on wards. 'The staff - the nurses - are brilliant,' he said. 'It seems to be a time management issue. 'The nurses have always been polite and helpful and happy to assist... then they have to deliver the bad news.' Dr Aresh Anwar, Heartlands’ medical director, said: 'We are extremely sorry that Mr Hay’s operation has had to be rescheduled several times as this is certainly not what we would want for our patients. Unfortunately, our hospitals currently remain under extreme pressure due to the high number of emergency admissions.'","Dale Hay, 25, had condition which caused his ribcage to grow inwards .

A surgeon and six accomplices have been jailed in China for illegal organ trading and intentional injury after a teenager sold them his kidney to buy an iPad and iPhone. Song Zhongyu performed the back-street operation on the 17-year-old schoolboy, identified only as Wang, who agreed to part with the organ in exchange for gadgets worth around £1,900. The student's mother raised the alarm after she became suspicious about where he had got the money for his new gizmos. In the dock: The surgeon performed the back-street operation on the 17-year-old schoolboy, identified only as Wang, who agreed to part with the organ in exchange for gadgets worth around £1,900 . Addressing the court: The group was said to have received around $35,000 (£22,000) for the transplant, while the student was reportedly given about $3,000 for his kidney, roughly £1,900 . He finally admitted to the deal when he began suffering from renal failure, telling how he had met the gang in an online chat room. A judge in Chenzhou City, in central China's Hunan Province, sentenced Song to three years behind bars with a reprieve of five years while the six others were jailed for between one and four years. A healthy kidney can sell on the international black market for anywhere between £15,000 and £30,000. China banned the trading of human organs in 2007 and have introduced a voluntary donor scheme to combat the trade. But official figures from the health ministry show that about 1.5 million people still need transplants, but only 10,000 are performed annually. As a result, the organ industry in China is booming and trading organs is a widespread online practice in the country. Few Chinese agree to donate their organs after death, further fuelling the rampant llegal market activity. Their sentence comes after mastermind He Wei was caged for five years for organising the illegal kidney trade in April 2011. The group was said to have received . around $35,000 (£22,000) for the transplant, while the student was . reportedly given about $3,000 for his kidney, roughly £1,900. He Wei earned $9,000 (£5,600) and Song was given £8,300 (£5,200) in the trade. The other seven defendants all received a share in the deal. The case has prompted an outpouring of . concern that not enough is being done to guard against the negative . impact of increasing consumerism in Chinese society, particularly among . young people. Apple products are extremely popular in China, but are too expensive for  many. IPhones start at around 3,988 yuan (£400), and iPads begin at 2,988 yuan - just under £190.

Kevin Beverley, who was left paralysed and brain damaged in a brutal attack, is now able to 'speak' again thanks to an iPad app . A man who was left paralysed and brain damaged in a vicious attack today said it was 'great' to be able to communicate for the first time in 20 years. Kevin Beverley, 55, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, could only make himself understood through grunts until he discovered an iPad application that 'speaks' for him. His first words were: 'At last, someone can hear me.' Mr Beverley was left severely injured in an unprovoked attack in his home town two decades ago. He suffered life-changing injuries, including brain damage, broken bones and paralysis on his right-hand side, and he lost his ability to speak. Staff at the Carlton daycare centre in Barnsley introduced him to the Grid Player application, which allows him to string sentences together by pressing symbols and pictures on his iPad. Using the device, he said: 'I love it. I think it is good, great,' said Mr Beverley. 'I can talk. I can play games.' Mr Beverley's cousin and carer, Elaine Sexton, said it was 'absolutely fantastic' to converse with him after after so long and said the family cannot wait to find out more about him. She said: 'It's brilliant. It brings him out of himself and we'll have the chance to get to know him better,' she said. 'He can't speak at all and it can get a bit frustrating for him - before he was injured he was active and outgoing. 'We've been with Kevin for years so we can tell a lot of things he wants. But now he's been asking for things himself.' 'He's going to have a better life. It's definitely going to make his quality of life better knowing he can communicate with us.' Staff at his daycare centre introduced him to the Grid Player application, which allows him to string sentences together by pressing symbols and pictures on his iPad . Breaking the silence: Mr Beverley's first words were 'At last, someone can hear me' She added: 'We had an iPad but we weren't aware of this programme. Then the centre told us about it and said Kevin could use it to communicate. This is an ideal solution for him. Workers at the Carlton Centre, which is run by the Disabilities Trust and which Mr Beverley has been visiting for seven months, said he took to the technology the instant they introduced him to it. Ray Riley, the centre's service manager, said: 'Kevin showed immediate interest. 'Since then we've found out more about Kevin than we have in the past seven months. 'We're able to communicate with him in a way he's never been able to communicate before. 'We know what he likes, what he wants, what his interests are. And Kevin summed it up when he said it was the first time he's been able to speak in public for 20 or so years. 'His first words were 'at last, someone can hear me'. Hearing that made us more determined. 'I think Kevin feels empowered. I think he feels useful, as though he can do things. ""The problem isn't his disability. It's his inability at times to be heard. And Kevin's now being heard. 'It makes us feel very proud. It makes us feel very humble as well."" The Disabilities Trust charity also plans to introduce eye scanners at each of its six Disability Lifestyle Services centres in England. The technology allows disabled users to communicate through a computer which tracks movement in eyes. The trust is currently trying to raise the £90,000 required to buy the life-changing equipment.","Kevin Beverley, was severely injured in unprovoked attack 20 years ago .

Pongpatana Porsoi, 26, was paraded before the press and made to reenact his movements during the alleged attack on a second floor walkway in the city of Nakorn Sri Thammarat in Southern Thailand. The woman, who is from Fort William, Scotland, claims she was attacked by four men and raped by two of them as she walked home from a night out at around 3am on Friday. Suspect: Pongpatana Porsoi, 26, wearing a stab vest to protect him, is led away by police in Thailand. He denies raping a 20-year-old British teacher claiming the sex had been consensual . She had previously accused the Thai . police of treating her like 'some drunk idiot' and treating the attack . as a joke. She was unable to positively identify Porsoi as one of the . attackers. Police reports yesterday quoted the . manager of a restaurant, where the woman was refused admittance, as . saying she was escorted to a room.

He said he had attempted to have sex . with her twice and claimed she had not resisted his advances but kept . repeating the words 'OK. Good'. Police were able to trace Pongpat because recordings from a security camera showed he was following her. The woman said she had been out with a . friend at a restaurant where she had drunk 'a few beers' before moving . on to a bar where she met another friend. She said her memory of the evening was hazy but added she had a clear description of two of her attackers. She said: 'I remember quite clearly what the two men who raped me looked like.

'One was wearing a black T-shirt and . the other was wearing a green khaki T-shirt, he had black hair and a gap . in his teeth or a tooth missing. 'They hit me in the face and on my . head. There are bruises on my arms from where they held me down and my . elbows and knees have been scraped.' Allegations: The British student said she was gang-raped in Nakhon Si Thammarat, southern Thailand . Police probing the attack have said . they are waiting for forensic reports from the hospital where she was . treated while their enquiries continue. But the woman has hit out at the way the authorities have dealt with her since the assault. She said: 'I've given three . statements to the police using two different interpreters, I feel like . I'm going round in circles with them. 'They tell me one thing and then . another, they've said something about a bouncer at the bar taking me . home and dropping me off, but he can't remember where that was.' She added: 'I still haven't received . anything back from the police, or from the hospital for tests for . diseases following the attack. 'How come no-one in nearby houses . heard anything happening? I was screaming and shouting during the . attack, there's no chance they never heard anything. 'The police have said the people . living nearby just thought it was a fight and didn't do anything.

For many women, a gay best friend is the ultimate accessory and now scientists have revealed the reason most females crave one. According to the research women want the friendship of a gay man because they offer them honest relationship advice, which they trust more than advice from straight friends because it's seen as unbiased counsel. According to a new study published in the Evolutionary Psychology journal girls can rely on gay men because they have no sexual interest in them, while their straight female friends can't be trusted as they are viewed as competition. Gay Best Friend: Matthew Williamson is often surrounded by a gaggle of girls including model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne . Eric Russell, lead author of the study, from the University of Texas at Austin, said: 'Friendships between straight women and gay men are free of hidden mating agendas. More... I bruv you, man! Two best friends who spend an astonishing 98% of their time together are crowned Britain's most 'Bromantic couple' (and yes, they do have girlfriends) Meet the 40-something childless singles turning to 'co-parent' partnerships - where raising a family doesn't include romance . 'They may be able to develop a deeper level of honesty because their relationship isn't complicated by sexual attraction or mating competition.' Students at Texas Christian University were asked to look at a identical Facebook profile to judge how much they would trust the person's dating advice if they were at a party. Friendship never ends: Designers Victoria Beckham and Marc Jacobs enjoy a close friendship . The honest truth: SATC's Carrie Bradshaw could always rely on GBF Stanford Blatch . The profile was the same for each participant except the gender and sexual orientation were changed for different participants. The study found that straight women deemed the advice of gay men to be more trustworthy than the same counsel offered by straight men and women. Equally, gay men trusted the advice of straight women above gay men and women. Mr Russell said: 'Women may have conflicts of interests with other women and straight men. 'Other women are potential competitors, and straight men may discourage relationships with other men and steer women toward themselves. 'Gay men, however, don't have these conflicts with straight women, so they may be uniquely positioned to provide mating-relevant advice and support that is not tainted with ulterior motives from sexual rivalry or sexual attraction.' Famous female celebrities who have close friendship with gay men include Victoria Beckham, Katie Price, Sienna Miller and Kate Moss.","Women need someone to give them solid relationship advice .

An inmate of an Israeli prison, who reportedly had connections to spy agency Mossad, hanged himself in the shower, it has been revealed. The man, dubbed 'Prisoner X', was 'found hanging in the shower of his security cell' on December 15 2010. He died from asphyxiation after he using a sheet tied to the bathroom window of his cell. An Australian TV show released information that identifies Prisoner X as Australian and Israeli spy Ben Zygier . The details have come to light after Israel partly lifted a gag order on the case, releasing previously unseen court documents. His cell in Ayalon prison was maximum . security that had CCTV and was designed for Yigal Amir the killer of . then Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Writer of the report, Judge Daphna Blatman Kedrai said: 'I have found evidence allegedly suggesting the fault of elements in the Israel Prison Service. 'Orders to prevent suicide were given and the elements entrusted with guarding the prisoner were aware of them. These orders were not upheld and a 'window of opportunity' was used by the deceased to commit suicide.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu argued last week that 'overexposure of security and intelligence activity' could harm Israel's security. He said '""We are not like all other countries. 'We are more threatened, more challenged, and therefore we have to ensure the proper activity of our security forces.' The prisoner was known in the media as Prisoner X as his identity and reasons for his imprisonment were secret. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believes that details of the case must be kept secret for Israel's security . On Tuesday the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) identified him as Ben Zygier, 34, who was a dual-citizen with the country. The agency claimed that Zygier had been working for both Israel's spy agency Mossad and the Australian Security Intelligence Operation. Israel has never confirmed Prisoner X's identity. ABC reported that Zygier gave 'comprehensive detail about a number of Mossad operations, including plans for a top-secret mission in Italy that had been years in the making.' They believe that Zygier was arrested after his connection to Australia was uncovered. Netanyahu's office released a statement today, saying that Prisoner X' never had any connection with the security and organizational services of Australia. 'Between Israel and all its organizations and between Australia and the Australian Security services, there is excellent cooperation, full coordination and full transparency about all the subjects on the agenda.'","Documents reveal that he hanged himself with a sheet from the window of his bathroom .

Conman: Darren Aston befriended an elderly couple before gaining a Power of Attorney to transfer their money to try and save his business. He has been jailed for five years . An estate agent who left an elderly couple 'destitute' after conning them out of more than £260,000 has been jailed for five years. Darren Aston, 42, from Shirley, Birmingham, used a Power of Attorney he obtained after befriending Marjorie Willits, 92, and Eric Dickinson 87 to funnel cash into his failing business. He had gained the trust of the pensioners are running errands, accompanying them on hospital visits after they suffered strokes and cooking Sunday lunch in their home. After being granted the Power of Attorney when the couple’s health deteriorated further, he then used it to drain their bank accounts of a total of £264,173.18 in just ten months. Aston initially denied two counts of fraud but later changed his plea during a trial at Birmingham Crown Court. He admitted stealing a total of £179.319.18 from Mrs Willits and £84.854 from Mr Dickinson. Two further counts of theft will lie on file. Judge Melbourne Inman QC told Aston the impact of his crimes on the couple, who now live in nursing homes, had been 'extreme,' adding: 'You could not find two more vulnerable victims.' The judge added that Marjorie Willits had wanted to live out her days at home but Aston’s actions meant she could no longer afford the care to do so. He told Aston: 'The position is now that Marjorie is 93 years of age, and Eric 87. Sadly whilst this was going on his health has deteriorated. Marjorie is in better health but is still very ill. 'I have to consider the amount of harm together with the degree of culpability. 'The level of harm caused is extreme, it is not simply the amount of money that was taken, but the amount of money that they had. 'She can’t understand why anyone would want to treat her like that. No doubt she blames herself. 'Now Marjorie can’t do what she wanted to do, because she wanted to leave assets to people who had helped her.' The court heard that the estate agent’s crimes were uncovered when Marjorie Willits feared Aston may have cashed in £30,000 worth of premium bonds as she was no longer receiving regular payments. Failing: Aston used the money to try and save his company Key Moves, pictured . Police probed Aston’s financial dealings and unearthed a number of cheques and banker’s drafts made out to his company Key Moves - totalling almost £160,000 - plus a consistent pattern of sizeable cash withdrawals. Aston claimed much of the money was a private loan agreement he intended to pay back and that he also had permission to take out cash in 'bits and bobs'. But investigators revealed what Aston classed as bits and bobs actually amounted to £100,000. Investigating officer DC Vicky Henry, said: 'Aston transferred large sums of money on a regular basis to help clear his debts - he left his elderly victims financially barren with little or no balance left in their bank accounts. Aston's victim Marjorie Willits . 'Aston slyly weaved his way into the couple’s confidence, he played the role of a helping hand there to offer support - but all along he was targeting their money to help dig himself out of a financial hole. 'Through our detailed enquiries we established a strong case against Aston, showing when he’d removed money without permission, yet he insisted his innocence until the very last minute. 'We will recover as much of the money as possible from him, and seizing assets, under the Proceeds of Crime Act.' In a victim impact statement read out in court, Mrs Willits said she 'wished' she suffered from dementia like Mr Dickinson so she could be spared the knowledge of Aston’s crimes. She said: 'I am pleased Aston pleaded guilty, but cannot understand why he would do this to me other than that it was purely greed. 'I feel all of the pressures in relation to this case have been placed on me as Eric had dementia and had no knowledge of what happened. 'I wish I was in his position so I would not have all these responsibility and worries. 'I’d like to thank everyone who has helped me. I now desperately want to return to my home where I have lived for 50 years. 'I have started struggling to see and nothing more can be taken from me now. 'I have spent most of my time at the care home in bed as I have been too tired to get up. 'The staff have been great but I just need to be back at my home now.’","Darren Aston was jailed for five years after pleading guilty to conning 92-year-old woman and 87-year-old man .

Desperate childless women who smuggle babies into the country ought to receive some sympathy, a top judge has ruled. According to Lord Justice Toulson, women who break the law to bring a child home should be shown mercy, not treated as ‘people traffickers’. The comments came as he presided over the case of Carmen Thomas, who was so desperate to become a mother that she pretended a girl born in the Philippines to a couple ‘who could not afford to keep her’ was her own. Lord Justice Toulson said childless mothers like Carmen Thomas, pictured with husband Mark, should not be treated as 'human traffickers'. Mrs Thomas was jailed after trying to smuggle a baby into the UK . Mrs Thomas was jailed after giving the baby her surname, signing her birth certificate and seeking a resettlement visa for her. But she will be freed next month after judges in London’s Criminal Appeal Court understood her overwhelming desire for a child and said she ought not to be treated as a ‘people trafficker’. Mrs Thomas, 50, from Sunderland, attempted to circumvent the UK’s complex adoption laws by making plans to smuggle the baby illegally into the country. After visiting the islands with husband Mark, a security guard, she tried to bring the baby back with her by pretending she had given birth to her there. But discrepancies on Mrs Thomas’s passport when she applied to embassy officials for a visa for the baby ‘gave the lie’ to her claim of motherhood and revealed that she had not been in the Philippines at the time she reported she had given birth. The application for a settlement visa . was ‘unsurprisingly rejected’ and she was arrested on her return to the . UK. The judge said that although a crime, she was motivated by 'her and her husband's desire to adopt a child' She was jailed for six months at Newcastle Crown Court on January . 22, having pleaded guilty to trying to facilitate a breach of . immigration laws. However, Lord Justice Toulson, sitting with Mr Justice Griffith Williams and Mr Justice Stuart-Smith, cut her sentence by a third, meaning she will be freed next month. Mrs Thomas travelled to the islands in May 2011, and, in June of that year, approached immigration officials at the British Embassy in Manila for a UK settlement visa for the child. Despite her failed attempt to bring the baby back to the UK, Mrs Thomas had bonded so much with her during their few weeks together that she is continuing to provide financial support for her, the court heard. Lord Justice Toulson said: ‘She and her husband had wanted to adopt a child, and she had believed she had adopted the baby. She will be freed next month after the hearing at the Criminal Appeal Court, at the Royal Courts of Justice . ‘She had posed as the birth mother because she knew it would have taken a long time to complete the adoption process in the Philippines and the UK. This was an attempt – not a sophisticated one, but it was persisted in – to circumvent legal adoption proceedings. The offence was completely out of character. ‘She attempted to facilitate the entry into the UK, knowing that her actions constituted a breach of immigration law. This was a deliberate attempt to circumvent the immigration laws, which required much foresight and planning. ‘Offending like this calls for general deterrence, but it is important to note that what was motivating Mrs Thomas was her and her husband’s desire to adopt a child, and this was not a case of trafficking. ‘While an immediate custodial sentence was inevitable, and that sentence must reflect the need for deterrence, we are satisfied that a sentence of four months imprisonment was sufficient in these circumstances.’","Lord Justice Toulson said childless women should be shown some sympathy .

Public concern over the welfare - to-work programme erupted last year when it emerged A4e boss Emma Harrison had paid herself £8.6m in a year . David Cameron’s flagship back-to-work programme was branded a ‘shocking’ failure last night – as it emerged that none of the 18 private providers has met its contract targets. In a damning assessment, the powerful Commons public accounts committee said the £5billion Work Programme had made an ‘extremely poor’ start since its launch in the summer of 2011. The scheme, personally championed by the Prime Minister, pays private sector firms such as A4e and G4S to find jobs for the long-term unemployed. But during its first 14 months only 3.6 per cent of claimants on the scheme moved off benefits into lasting jobs. Spending on the programme during the period totalled £435million, with each long-term job costing more than £14,000. The figures for the first 12 months were even worse. Of 785,360 people referred to the Work Programme, just 18,270 (or 2.3 per cent) were found a lasting job. Officials had estimated that 5 per cent would find jobs on their own in the first year if the scheme did not exist. Margaret Hodge, Labour chairman of the committee, said: ‘The Work Programme is absolutely crucial for helping people, especially the most vulnerable, get into and stay in work. However its performance so far has been extremely poor. ‘The programme is particularly failing young people and the hardest to help. 'It is shocking that of the 9,500 former incapacity benefit claimants referred to providers, only 20 people have been placed in a job that has lasted three months, while the poorest performing provider did not manage to place a single person in the under-25 category into a job lasting six months. 'The department must hold failing providers to account.’ The committee said it shared concerns that providers are concentrating on creaming off job placement bonuses from the  easiest cases, and sidelining clients who require more time and investment, a process known as ‘creaming and parking’. David Cameron on the campaign trail in Eastleigh. His flagship back-to-work programme was branded a 'shocking' failure last night - as it emerged that none of the 18 private providers has met its contract targets . Under the Work Programme, providers can earn between £3,700 and £13,700 per client, depending how hard it is to help an individual, with an initial payment of between £400 and £600. The main payments are made only after someone has been in work for six months – the Government’s definition of sustained employment. Individuals are placed on the programme for two years, meaning that a full assessment of the scheme will not be possible until this summer. Ministers have written to seven of the 18 private providers warning them they could lose their contracts unless they improve performance. None of the providers has met its targets. Public concern over the welfare-to-work programme erupted last year when it emerged A4e boss Emma Harrison had paid herself £8.6million in a year, despite claims that the firm’s record in finding jobs for the unemployed was ‘abysmal’. The Department for Work and Pensions last night said the report painted a ‘skewed picture’. A spokesman said: ‘It is making a real difference to tens of thousands of the hardest-to-help jobseekers.

"By . Vanessa Allen . PUBLISHED: . 20:07 EST, 21 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:47 EST, 21 February 2013 . Two thirds of jurors do not understand a judge’s legal direction, research has revealed. As lawyers and judges tried to defend the jury system in the aftermath of the collapse of the trial of Chris Huhne’s ex-wife Vicky Pryce, the study found that jurors in that case were not alone in failing to grasp their brief. The two-year analysis of trial by jury also found that jurors frequently used the internet to research trials, despite warnings not to do so because of the risk of miscarriages of justice. Scrutiny: The collapse of the trial of Vicky Pryce, left, ex-wife of former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne, right, has raised questions about the strength of the jury system . The researchers suggested that jurors should be given written cards which clearly explained their responsibilities throughout the trial process. Former Director of Public Prosecutions, Lord Macdonald, called for further research into the system of trial by jury, including greater study of jurors’ deliberations. The jurors in the Pryce trial sent the judge an extraordinary list of questions about basic aspects of the case. Mr Justice Sweeney said the questions demonstrated ‘absolutely fundamental deficits in understanding’ and he discharged the jury. The questions included: ‘Can a juror come to a verdict based on a reason that was not presented in court and has no facts or evidence to support it, either from the prosecution or the defence?’ Lord Macdonald of River Glaven said the case highlighted the need for greater scrutiny of juries’ deliberations. Under the Contempt of Court Act it is a criminal offence to ask about any opinions expressed during a jury’s attempts to reach a verdict in a case. Lord Macdonald told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘We perhaps ought to allow a bit more access to jury reasoning than we do. ‘I think it is impossible for researchers to conduct any kind of examination at any time into what has gone on in jury rooms.’ He said other countries allowed researchers to question jurors about their deliberations and thought processes. Lord Macdonald added: ‘I think it’s one of the greatest strengths of our system that we bring citizens into its heart. ‘The feeling of most criminal lawyers is that, by and large, most juries come to the right decision and that most criminal trials end in the right verdict.’ Lord Woolf, the former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, said he believed the jury system was ‘well tried’ and that the Pryce case was ‘exceptional’. He said juries acted as the ‘final safety valve’ in the legal system because they allowed ordinary men and women to decide a case and to guard against potential miscarriages of justice. Leading criminal lawyer John Cooper QC said the alternative to trial by jury was the ‘frightening’ prospect of all verdicts being reached by judges. He added: ‘Sometimes juries get it right, sometimes they get it wrong. This is a system based on human beings and human beings are fallible. ‘But the alternative is more frightening, the alternative is not being tried by our peers and by a judge.’ Michael Turner QC, chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, said he thought the Pryce jury’s questions were ‘perfectly sensible’. He said: ‘It’s disrespectful to suggest that they weren’t working it through. ‘If you were put on trial by the State would you want someone who is salaried by the State to be judging the facts of it? Of course you wouldn’t. You would want ordinary people to do it.’ Trial by jury is an expensive process which costs the taxpayer £3,000 a day once a case is sent to Crown Court. Several Home Secretaries and justice ministers have considered reforms to axe the right to jury trial for some offences. Jack Straw tried to reduce the number of cases that go before juries and David Blunkett tried to introduce judge-only trials in complex fraud cases. But the proposals met opposition from civil liberty campaigners and the House of Lords. Pryce, 60, will face a retrial over the allegation that she perverted the course of justice by taking her then-husband Huhne’s speeding points a decade ago. She denies the charge. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘Trial by jury has served us well for hundreds of years and delivers justice across the country every day.’","Under the spotlight following collapse of Vicky Pryce trial .

Asda boss Andy Clarke says that shoppers are switching to vegetarian meals in the wake of the horse meat scandal . Shoppers have abandoned hamburgers and steak and switched to vegetarian meals in the wake of the horse meat scandal, the boss of Asda has revealed. Speaking for the first time since it emerged the firm served up horse meat in own-brand products, chief executive Andy Clarke admitted: ‘Consumers have switched to veggie meals. ‘Meat free products have also seen a lift. ‘In overall terms there has been a small impact to meat sales.’ Asda was dragged into the scandal last week when it found 4.8per cent horsemeat in its fresh Chilled Beef Bolognese Sauce, while four types of its frozen beefburgers were positive for traces of equine DNA. It has also withdrawn another 35 own-label and big brand lines, including fresh sauces, burgers and even diced pork, as a precaution. Mr Clarke said he ‘felt a responsibility’ as Chief Executive for the scandal which had engulfed the UK’s second biggest supermarket chain. But when asked whether he would be waving his annual bonus in light of the revelations he said: ‘We will pay all of our colleagues a bonus this year.’ Mr Clarke said he has been shocked at the horse meat revelations, but rejected claims that a drive to keep prices down had encouraged suppliers to cut corners. ‘There’s no excuse for something criminal happening in the supply chain,’ he said. ‘It’s fundamentally wrong. This has dented trust and I am absolutely committed to rebuilding that. ‘I don’t think we have all the answers yet – we will find a solution either as an industry or individually – we will leave no stone unturned.’ He said there would be a renewed focus on buying British meat – almost 75 per cent of its beef is locally sourced. Asda is also attempting to own more of its own processing factories. A new survey shows that one in four shoppers have resolved to buy less processed meat since the scandal broke. Involved: Asda was dragged into the scandal last week when it found 4.8per cent horsemeat in its fresh Chilled Beef Bolognese Sauce . The equivalent of four million people had decided to stop buying processed meat altogether after horse DNA was found in beef products, a survey by Consumer Intelligence found. Just over one in five have also started buying less meat overall while 6 per cent claimed to know someone who had gone vegetarian as a direct result of the scandal. Mr Clarke admitted trust among consumers had been dented, but said his solution would be a ‘belt and braces’ approach to labelling to restore confidence. He said: ‘We weren’t on our own to be shocked by what came out six weeks ago. Off putting: Just over one in five have also started buying less meat overall while 6 per cent claimed to know someone who had gone vegetarian as a direct result of the scandal . ‘For us as a business, the first thing we did was look inside our own organisation to identify if we had anything we should be concerned about. ‘Right from the start we took a very transparent approach and, of course, embarked on what is a world-leading change for the industry and our organisation in terms of testing. ‘What is clear is that there is significant adulteration in the supply chain. ‘For Asda, at the end of the day, our customers come into our stores and they expect to buy what’s on the label.’ The firm, which is owned by America’s Wal-Mart posted a 0.1 per cent increase in underlying sales for the fourth quarter, contributing to a 1 per cent rise in annual sales.","Asda boss Andy Clarke says that more people are buying meat-free meals .

Popular: Three in five adults now drink cider, significantly up from the previous year¿s total of 47 per cent . The sweet success of cider looks set to continue as soaring numbers of Britons switch to the popular drink sending sales up to £2.7 billion last year, a new report shows today. With lager companies now also looking to capitalise on the growth in the UK cider market, the nation’s desire for the fruity drink shows no signs of losing fizz just yet. According to latest research from market analysts Mintel, three in five adults now drink cider, significantly up from the previous year’s total of 47 per cent. This progress means that in 2012, a greater share of adults drank cider than spirits. Cider is even closing in on beer in terms of usage, a market which has struggled to retain its base of drinkers in recent years, standing at 70 per cent in 2012. While its recent successes have helped a number of cider producers to grow rapidly, Mintel research shows that the market’s future prospects could be equally positive as, even among cider drinkers, 23 per cent state that it does not always occur to them to drink it. Chris Wisson, Senior Drinks Analyst at Mintel said: 'Cider continues to stand out as one of the star performers among alcoholic drinks markets. 'Usage has flourished in recent years as the market has improved its image, with strong growth at the premium tier. 'The market has also performed well on the back of its accessibility, with its accessible flavour profiles helping to attract new users such as women and 18-34 year-olds. 'While many drinks markets are struggling to grow in real terms and are also hampered by the government’s tax escalator, cider is one of the anomalous success stories which is also showing underlying volume growth.' Cider is in fact one of the few success stories in the alcohol market, achieving steady growth despite the economic downturn. Success: Cider is in fact one of the few success stories in the alcoholic drinks market, achieving steady growth despite the economic downturn. Big business: Drinkers spent £2.7billion on cider in the UK last year . Over the last five years sales of cider have increased by 32 per cent to reach £2.7 billion in 2012, up from £1.8 billion in 2007 and with sales increasing 5 per cent in the last year alone. Meanwhile volume sales have posted slower growth, although the market still managed overall growth of 18 per cent between 2007 and 2012. The success of cider looks set to continue in the coming years, with new producers continuing to build momentum and with strong consumer demand leading to a better range of ciders in both the on- and off-trade sales channels. Over the next five years, Mintel forecasts that the market will reach sales of £3.7 billion, driven partly by duty increases but also growing user numbers. While apple remains the nation’s favourite flavour of cider, drunk by 47 per cent of adults, there are striking signs of growth coming from the pear and flavoured segments. Pear has grown to be a firm favourite amongst cider drinkers, and is drunk by almost four in ten  adults, buoyed by the emergence of brands such as Strongbow and Stella Cidre. Scrumpy: Apple remains the nation's favourite flavour of cider though pear is becoming increasingly liked . Meanwhile, almost a quarter of Brits have drunk any other type of fruit-flavoured cider, with flavours in this adventurous segment ranging from cloudberry to toffee apple. 'Pear cider is now a highly profitable segment of the market and one which producers should almost be prioritising on a par with apple cider,' Chris continues. 'While apple continues to drive most of the sales, pear can also be an effective gateway into the market, with a particular appeal to female drinkers. 'However, pear is still underperforming in terms of appealing to older drinkers and operators may be well served in highlighting features such as a British heritage and ingredient quality to appeal to these more traditional cider drinkers.' While the cider market continues to make great strides, there are still a number of challenges for producers to overcome. Many of these relate to its image as amongst lager, wine and RTD drinkers, just 8 per cent think that cider is sophisticated while 14 per cent think that it is worth paying more for, both of which are significantly behind associations with wine.","A greater share of UK adults now drink cider than spirits .

According to family friends 45-year old Carlos Zuniga,had been suffering from depression over his financial situation before he shot his wife Michelle, daughter Lauren and son Stefan . 'As officers arrived, screaming and possible gunshots were heard from inside the home,' said police spokesman Detective William Moreno to the Miami Herald. 'Officers quickly assembled a small team and made entry into the home to protect those in danger.' A neighbor, Enrique Cal who heard the shooting, remarked on how sad the event was for the affluent neighborhood. 'Oh, yeah, it's tragic,' said Cal. 'He shot his own kids and wife, tried to kill everybody.' 'Those people never had any problems. They were very decent people. It's very sad, very sad, unbelievable that this happened.' 'The last shot that he fired was one that he took to himself,' he added. 'The wife was laying outside on the grass next to the sidewalk, and the daughter was brought out by a police officer, (he) dragged her out.' Police said that as of Thursday, Michelle and Lauren remained in a critical condition and that each was shot multiple times.

I heard the two shots, we lowered the TV, and we heard the cry for help,' she said. 'A little girl screaming, 'Help.' 'It shocked me because she's just a little girl,' she said. 'Kids shouldn't get hurt.'

Zuniga had recently put one of his balloons on sale on an industry website. And Colin Graham, a family friend said he knew the family business did not seem to be doing so well professionally.

A third woman admitted she was ‘not comfortable’ with the idea of wearing a jacket since that would make her ‘look like an office worker’.

Dead mice laced with painkillers are set to rain down on Guam as scientists attempt to contain two million brown tree snakes which have caused havoc for more than 60 years. Most of Guam's native bird species are extinct because of the snake, which reached the island's thick jungles as stowaways on U.S. military ships coming from the South Pacific shortly after World War II. There are fears that without action the species could spread to Hawaii, more than 3,000 miles away and cause a 'snakes on a plane' scenario. The brown tree snake was brought to Guam on U.S. military ships more than 60 years ago and has wreaked havoc . The snakes can climb power poles . and wires, causing blackouts, or slither into homes and bite people, . including babies; they use venom on their prey but it is not lethal to . humans. Most of Guam's native birds were . defenseless against the nocturnal, tree-based predators, and within a . few decades of the reptile's arrival, nearly all of them were wiped out. The infestation and the toll it has . taken on native wildlife have tarnished Guam's image as a tourism haven, . though the snakes are rarely seen outside their jungle habitat. The solution to this headache, fittingly enough, is acetaminophen, the active ingredient in painkillers including Tylenol. The U.S. government will drop dead mice laced with painkillers in an attempt to control and contain the numbers of brown tree snakes. Agriculture wildlife specialist Tony Salas holds a brown tree snake at Andersen Air Force Base on the island of Guam . The venom of brown tree snakes is not harmful to humans but they have been known to bite babies in Guam . Daniel Vice, assistant state director of U.S. Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services in Hawaii, Guam, and the Pacific Islands, said: 'We are taking this to a new phase. There really is no other place in the world with a snake problem like Guam.' Acetaminophen, the same drug used in pain killers like Tylenol, will be used to lace the dead mice as bait . The strategy takes advantage of the snake's two big weaknesses. Unlike most snakes, brown tree snakes are happy to eat prey they didn't kill themselves, and they are highly vulnerable to acetaminophen, which is harmless to humans. The upcoming mice drop is targeted to hit snakes near Guam's sprawling Andersen Air Force Base, which is surrounded by heavy foliage and if compromised would offer the snakes a potential ticket off the island. Using helicopters, the dead neonatal mice will be dropped by hand, one by one. U.S. government scientists have been perfecting the mice-drop strategy for more than a decade with support from the Department of Defense and the Department of the Interior. To keep the mice bait from dropping all the way to the ground, where it could be eaten by other animals or attract insects as they rot, researchers have developed a flotation device with streamers designed to catch in the branches of the forest foliage, where the snakes live and feed. Experts say the impact on other species will be minimal, particularly since the snakes have themselves wiped out the birds that might have been most at risk. 'One concern was that crows may eat mice with the toxicant,' said William Pitt, of the U.S. National Wildlife Research Center's Hawaii Field Station. 'However, there are no longer wild crows on Guam. We will continue to refine methods to increase efficiency and limit any potential non-target hazards.' Just as the snakes found their way to Guam, they could stow away on a ship, or more likely the cargo hold of an airplane, and begin breeding on other islands around the Pacific or even the U.S. West Coast. It is hoped the mouse bomb will help to contain the species to limit the damage in Guam and stop spread to Hawaii . The risk of the snakes spreading has officials in Hawaii on edge. The islands of Hawaii, like Guam, lack the predators that could keep a brown tree snake population in check. Brown tree snakes are known as an invasive species because of the destruction they cause in their habitat. They are native to Australia and Papua New Guinea and usually measure around 6ft, but can grow to be 10ft long. Their appearance varies from a lightly patterned brown to yellowish green or beige with red saddle-shaped blotches . They have two fangs at the rear of their mouth containing neutrotoxic and cytotoxic venom, which is not dangerous to humans. Females produce up to 12 eggs at a time which are just over one inch long. Native Hawaiian birds 'literally don't know what to do when they see a snake coming,' said Christy Martin, a spokeswoman for the Coordinating Group on Alien Pest Species, a partnership of Hawaii government agencies and private organizations. A 2010 study conducted by the National Wildlife Research Center found brown tree snakes would cause between $593 million and $2.14 billion in economic damage each year if they became established in Hawaii like they are on Guam. Power outages would cause the most damage, followed by a projected decline in tourism. The cost of treating snake bites would account for a small share. 'Once we get snakes here, we're never going to be able to fix the situation,' Martin said. So far, Guam's containment seems to be working. Only a few brown tree snakes have ever been found in Hawaii, and none over the past 17 years. 'If we continue doing what we are doing, the chance of success is very high,' Vice said. 'If what we are doing stops, I think the possibility of the snakes getting to Hawaii is inevitable.' The mouse drop is set to start in April or May. Hawaiian Officials fear brown tree snakes would cause $2billion damage if they travelled 3,000 across the Pacific . Brown tree snakes were brought over to Guam after WWII when they stowed away on American military ships .","Two million brown tree snakes have made species of wildlife extinct in Guam .

It was a picture-postcard village pond, enjoyed by locals and the perfect natural habitat  otters for 150 years. But now the former beauty spot in Kerry, north Wales, has been transformed into a muddy mess after the owner drained the pool of water without planning permission. Furious environmental groups have blasted the move and called for the pond to be refilled and its beauty restored. Picture-perfect: The dramatic transformation of a village pond from picture-postcard beauty to a muddy mess shocked villagers in north Wales . The owner John Pryce, however, says he will press on with work on the pond and is now awaiting a verdict on an application to Powys County Council's planning department. The application, which is partly retrospective, seeks permission to construct a causeway and re-profile the pool which has existed since the 1860s. However, the Countryside Council for Wales and Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust have both objected to the application on ecological grounds. They say an island at the pool was used by otters prior to it being drained and the work carried out has destroyed their habitat. They have called for the pond to be returned to its former state and the proposal to create a causeway is abandoned, in the hope of encouraging otters to return. Local residents say they also have concerns that the pond will be used as a commercial fishery. Muddy mess: Furious environmental groups say draining the pond has destroyed a natural habitat for otters . A letter submitted to PCC by MWT's conservation officer says: 'We know that otter used the site as recently as April 2012 and the work which was carried out subsequently destroyed their habitat, thereby contravening the legislation. 'The applicant therefore has a duty to carry out mitigation works as soon as possible to reinstate otter habitat on the site, including the removal of the part built causeway.' However, the man behind the application denied plans to create a commercial fishery and said the work being carried out is vital to safeguard the future of the pond. He also said he was not aware of the presence of any otters before carrying out the work but will contest the mitigation request and will attempt to fence the otters out if legally allowed. He said: 'There has been a fishery there that has been fished for years. The quality of the lining means that this has not been viable and we intend to restore that. 'It's an area that needs maintenance. Our intention is to stop flooding and make the body of water secure and, secondly, make it something worth fishing.' Mr Pryce said the causeway had been created 'because of the stuff that's dug out during the relining process'. He added: 'We have had a lot of trouble with locals down there but we are talking about four or five people not the whole village by any stretch. 'What we are struggling to understand is what people's opinion to it is and what would suit them.

New York City officials say they are seeing a decline in the city's rat population in the wake of Superstorm Sandy, despite many residents' complaints that they are seeing an uptick in rodent infestations. The city's health department, . which collects reams of data about the rat population and maps . infestations looking for trends, said rodent complaints actually had . declined since the late October storm, which was spawned when Hurricane . Sandy merged with two other weather systems. 'The . Health Department conducted extensive inspections in flood zones after . Hurricane Sandy, provided guidance to home owners and baited the area. But we did not see an increase in the rat population,' the agency said . in a statement. New York City's health department, which collects reams of data about the rat population, said rodent complaints actually had declined since Superstorm Sandy . 'Large storms can flush out rats, but they also drown . many rats, and the net effect of large storms is often a decrease in the . rat population,' the agency added. The number of rodent-related citations issued by health inspectors has dropped as well. The . Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city's subway . system, the nation's largest, also dismissed tales of rats being stirred . up by Sandy. 'We noticed no unusual rat activity or rodent activity in the wake of the storm,' agency spokesman Charles Seaton said. He also said that when water was pumped . out of flooded tunnels and stations, there weren't large numbers of rat . carcasses left behind. But TV stations and newspapers have been rife with reports about rats infesting parked cars and fleeing the East River waterfront for the brownstones of Brooklyn Heights and exterminators enjoying a boom in business. For some city officials, the last straw came a week ago when a rodent problem forced a two-day closure of Magnolia Bakery, a Manhattan landmark often credited with starting a national cupcake craze. Within days, a city councilwoman floated a proposal to create a $500,000 emergency rat mitigation program for storm-impacted neighborhoods. Retired pest control expert Dale Kaukeinen, who spent 30 years in the extermination business, said his first instinct was that Sandy probably decimated the rodent population in some neighborhoods . The idea of a mass rat migration drew ridicule from Richard Reynolds, who leads a group of dog owners who conduct urban rat hunts. 'What happened to the rats? Nothing! We're finding rats right where we've always found them,' he said. 'I think this whole idea that there has been some kind of major relocation of rats is just good news media fodder.' He noted, as did other experts, that Norwegian rats, the species found in New York, are known for being especially strong swimmers. 'I have seen them dive over 70 feet, swim 500 yards, give me the finger and head for the hills,' he said. 'Hurricane Sandy is not going to affect these critters.' Hard scientific data, though, is still largely lacking, and there is plenty of room for debate. Retired . pest control expert Dale Kaukeinen, who spent 30 years in the . extermination business, said his first instinct was that Sandy probably . decimated the rodent population in some neighborhoods. But he said he . couldn't rule out the possibility that displaced rats had moved into new . territory. 'They are adaptable. They can swim. They can move distances,' he said, citing radio telemetry studies . showing that rats can move several miles if displaced by environmental . conditions. Also, . because rats live in a world of smell, their former homes might have . been rendered unfamiliar by a flood, he said, even if the buildings, . parks or tunnels they had been living in suffered little permanent . damage. While overall rat populations are down, there is evidence that there has been a rise in select Manhattan neighborhoods near where flooding occurred, including the West Village . 'To a rat, it wouldn't look the same, it wouldn't smell the same,' he said. Jessica Lappin, the councilwoman who proposed the emergency extermination program for flood-damaged neighborhoods, said she was skeptical when she first started hearing stories about rat infestations since the storm but has come to believe the problem is real. 'We are used to seeing rats. But it definitely seemed to be getting worse,' Lappin said. She noted that even though the health department's citywide rat complaint numbers show no increase, there has been a rise in select Manhattan neighborhoods near where flooding occurred. Those neighborhoods include the West Village, where mice first turned up in a basement storage area at Magnolia Bakery in the weeks after the storm, company spokeswoman Sara Gramling said Thursday. The bakery was cited by city health inspectors in January, then was closed down Feb. 14 after a follow-up inspection. It reopened two days later, with lines even longer than usual. Gramling said she was sure the storm was a factor in the infestation, although she noted that there is also a large construction project taking place down the block. 'At the building, and in the West Village, there has been an influx across the board,' she said. 'We don't feel like it's an isolated incident. Clearly there is a trend.' Thomas King, a manager at M&M Pest Control, an extermination business based in Chinatown, said his company's rat calls are up 20 percent to 30 percent since the storm. Recent media coverage of the supposed rat scamper caused by Sandy has focused on Brooklyn Heights, a historic district perched on a hill above the East River. But the neighborhood's rat problem is hardly new. Nearly every year has brought a new newspaper story about rats in the neighborhood, usually linked to trash left by visitors to the Brooklyn Promenade, the neighborhood's elevated esplanade. The Brooklyn Heights Association, a civic group, did get some reports after the storm about new rat burrows being dug in gardens along the Promenade, but city park officials took quick action, and there have not been any complaints since. So the mystery remains. At least one notable rat population perished for sure: 7,000 lab rats and mice at a New York University research facility died when the building flooded during the storm.","NYC's health department says rodent complaints since late October have declined .

"By . Leon Watson . PUBLISHED: . 10:08 EST, 22 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:49 EST, 22 February 2013 . Family pet: Caitlin and Kadyann Green with their 'dangerous' dog Chunk . Postmen have stopped delivering to 70 homes on an entire street on health and safety grounds because a family won't control its dog, it emerged today. Royal Mail told residents their road is too dangerous for postmen to walk down following a number of 'near misses' involving the dog, called Chunk. They informed locals about the ban by letter, which they hand delivered. Homeowners in Bulwell, Nottinghanshire, now have to travel two miles to collect their mail from a delivery office. Today, . the dog's owner Donna Green, 33, says Chunk is a harmless pet who . happily plays with her young children Caitlin, eight, Kadyann, seven. She . said: 'Chunk is a family pet - he's not bitten anybody. If anything . he's too friendly. We think the posties don't like him going up and . wagging his tail at them because he is big and spreads hairs on their . uniforms. 'We've been down to the Royal Mail and spoken to them, and we've even put a post box up on the fence. 'There was never a problem with the dog in the first place. He looks big but he isn't going to do anything to anybody. 'I've got kids - I would not have the dog with them if he was dangerous.' Her partner Adam, 33, added: 'He's a . big softie. All the kids play with him - he is like a big teddy bear. I . can let him off the lead when we go for a walk because he will not . bother anyone at all. 'Royal Mail are just being ridiculous, We just can't understand it at all.' Locals . received letters from Royal Mail on February 9 telling them deliveries . had been suspended because of the bull mastiff cross. They . were told the decision was taken after repeated requests to the owners . to keep Chunk under control. Residents yesterday reacted angrily at the . ban, branding the posties 'pansies'. Resident Harry Harper, 52, said: 'I've never known such a friendly dog in all my life. It truly is laughable. 'And then when they delivered the letters . to say they wouldn't be delivering any letters - they didn't even post . that days letters. It's all a bit bizarre.' The street in Nottingham where postmen are refusing to deliver mail to the entire street because of an 'aggressive' dog . Seventy families won't get their post in Spruce Gardens, Bulwell, because of the dog . (File picture) Royal Mail said more than 3,000 postmen and woman and attacked by dogs every year . Kathleen Flinders, 58, added: 'It's quite difficult for us because my husband has just had a knee operation so he can't drive at the moment and we've had to ask a neighbour to help us out. 'My husband had the operation done privately and this is delaying the bills for that. It's very unfair we are being penalised for someone else's dog.' A spokesperson for Royal Mail apologised for the inconvenience, adding: 'The regular postman has on many occasions been unable to deliver the mail as an aggressive dog is being allowed to roam free in the area. 'Deliveries had already been suspended to the address where the dog lives and we have asked the owners to keep the dog under control so that the postman can complete his round safely. 'Unfortunately, this hasn't happened. Following a number of near misses and a risk assessment of the area, we have had to temporarily suspend deliveries to these properties as a precautionary measure. 'We have written to those customers affected and we are sorry for the inconvenience this may cause.' 'The safety and welfare of our staff is paramount and we only suspend deliveries if the safety of our postmen and women is at risk and as a last resort.' He added that more than 3,000 postmen and woman and attacked by dogs every year.","Royal Mail informed locals in Bulwell, Nottinghanshire,  about ban by letter .
