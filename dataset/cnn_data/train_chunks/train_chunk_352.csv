"(CNN) -- Protesters demanding that the newly installed military government step aside clashed with security forces in Burkina Faso's capital on Sunday as regional leaders pleaded for calm. After the resignation of President Blaise Compaore -- who himself faced violent protests over his desire to extend his 27-year rule -- Burkina Faso's military took power. On Sunday, a huge crowd gathered in Ouagadougou, protesting the military government and demanding the return to constitutional rule. Gunfire erupted during clashes between the protesters and security forces near the location of the state news television channel, local journalist Ouezen Louis Oulon told CNN. On Saturday, the military consolidated its support behind Lt. Col. Isaac Yacouba Zida, who will serve as interim President until elections can be held. On Sunday, as the protests renewed, the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States called for peace and an orderly transition to democracy. Compaore resigned as President after initially vowing to stay until elections could be held, despite violent protests to his desire to extend his lengthy rule. His decision to step down ""opens the necessary political space for all the stakeholders to work together to find a lasting resolution to the crisis facing the country,"" the head of the African Union, Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, said in a statement. The African Union's Peace and Security Council will hold a meeting on Monday to discuss the crisis in Burkina Faso. Dlamini-Zuma said she prefers an agreement that will lead to a civilian-led transition toward elections for a new government. She called on Burkina Faso's military to place themselves at the disposal of civilian authorities. ECOWAS Chairman John Dramani Mahama offered a more general assessment, calling for all parties to ""work in the overall interest of the people of Burkina Faso in order to guarantee peace and stability in the region."" Demonstrators last week stormed Parliament, setting fire to the building. The protests came amid rising discontent about the high cost of living and Compaore's attempts to amend the country's constitution to help him extend his term. Compaore had been in office since he took power after a bloody coup in 1987. The country was formerly known as the Republic of Upper Volta when it was established in 1958 as a self-governing colony under France.","Protesters clashed with security forces in Burkina Faso's capital on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Sierra Leone lifted Sunday a nationwide lockdown, which had been put in place to help stop the spread of Ebola. Under the plan, no one was allowed to leave their homes for three days, allowing volunteers to go door-to-door educating people on the deadly virus. More than 75% of the targeted 1.5 million households were contacted, according to the Health Ministry. ""The EOC (Emergency Operations Center) has officially ended the three day stay at home, but the Social Mobilization exercise will continue in those communities that have been identified as hot spots across the country,"" it said in a statement. The deadliest Ebola outbreak in history has killed at least 2,600 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- the countries most affected by the virus -- since the first case was documented in December. The virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids, and early symptoms include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat. The virus is named after the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), where one of the first outbreaks occurred in 1976. INTERACTIVE: Life inside the Ebola outbreak .

"(CNN) -- Deborah Harkness found a productive way to cope with her mid-life crisis. The accomplished academic turned to fiction writing. ""Some people buy expensive cars,"" the 49-year-old author says. ""I wrote a novel."" It wasn't just any novel, either. Harkness' debut, ""A Discovery of Witches,"" launched the best-selling ""All Souls"" trilogy, which has been described by at least one reviewer as ""Harry Potter but for grown-ups."" While historian Harkness had already published several academic books and articles, fiction writing was a new endeavor. Harkness found freedom in looking into her imagination, rather than her research, while writing about a star-crossed witch and vampire. When she doesn't know the answer to something she's writing about, she can get creative, but she stayed true to her roots in history when she wrote the trilogy. (One character, Matthew Clairmont, is 1,500 years old and his paramour, Diana Bishop is a historian, herself). ""The Book of Life,"" came out in July and weaves together supernatural creatures and good old-fashioned family drama. In this series finale, the now-married protagonists wrestle with real world demons, as well as mythical creatures. In addition to her literary career, Harkness teaches history at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. She spoke with CNN about love, literature and why the humanities still matter in academia. Below is an edited transcript. CNN: How have you managed the transition from academic writer to fiction writer? Harkness: I never had a plan to be a fiction writer. It's something that happened to me. Sometimes I think maybe it was my spectacular mid-life crisis. Some people buy expensive cars, and I wrote a novel. I think even if you had said to me in 2007, ""I predict you will write a novel next year,"" I would have bet my house against it. There was no plan for it. I was so deeply involved in the world of scholarship, and indeed I still am. I reached a point where it was really a kind of interesting challenge to me, to think about how could I make the case to a wider audience that history and a knowledge of the past was meaningful and relevant. CNN: How has your experience of writing fiction informed your teaching? Deborah Harkness: I think it has made me a much better teacher of writing itself. After 20 years of writing academic prose and lectures, it seems very familiar and straightforward to me. Writing a novel for the first time, I was reminded of just how difficult it is to figure out how to get this stuff done when you don't really know what you're doing. I think I have a lot more empathy for my own students, and for their learning process. And it's a two-way street, in that my teaching, and what I'm working on and what I'm talking about in the classroom, are constantly informing the fiction as I write it. CNN: Family plays a big role in the trilogy. How have you been able to weave that in? Harkness: So much fiction focuses on: ""Will they or won't they? Will our two heroes, or our hero and heroine, get together?"" That question has not ever really interested me. Falling in love is really relatively easy, compared to staying in love and building a family that lasts. I always wanted to focus on that aspect of it, which I think is something that is so crucial and vital in so many ways, and so important, and so very tricky, because a lot of compromises and adjustments have to be made. People who get through ""The Book of Life"" and then are looking back over the whole trilogy, are going to say: ""She's been talking about this since the very beginning."" These have never been two lovers just off on a date, with nobody around them who mattered. It's always been about building a family and a community around themselves. CNN: How has the research process been different from your academic work? Harkness: The research is not that much different, but the writing is. When I don't know the answers to something, and I'm writing a work of academic non-fiction, I have to look up the answers and be really, really precise. And of course, if I don't know the answer to something in fiction, I can make it up. There are still a lot of things I do look up if I want to get them right. But it is kind of a wonderfully creative thing thinking, ""Oh -- what if Shakespeare was actually not the center of attention, but kind of a hanger-on. That would be fun to play with."" You do get to imagine yourself into places where the historical research just can't take you because there are no records that survive. For a historian, who's normally not allowed to do that, that was also a lot of fun. CNN: What courses are you teaching? Harkness: In the Spring, I will be teaching a seminar on queens, witches and courtesans -- women and power in early Modern Europe. And the other course I'm teaching for the very first time is public history. For our undergraduate majors, (it's about) what do you do with your degree in history? How can you bring your historical skills to bear on a wider community? There is a lot of talk in the academy about the death of the humanities. Based on my readers' response, and their interest in history and literature and art, the death of the humanities has been grossly overstated. I would love for my students to take a leading role in reminding people that this stuff is important and it really matters.","Deborah Harkness' ""All Souls Trilogy"" has sold more than a million copies .

"Washington (CNN) -- A bipartisan group of congressmen wrote President Barack Obama on Wednesday, urging him to take stronger steps to prevent Ebola from spreading in the U.S. The 26 members of Congress urged Obama to toughen airport screenings, ban citizens of impacted West African countries from traveling to the U.S. and consider quarantining travelers who have recently traveled to those countries. ""With three nations in Africa currently facing an Ebola epidemic, our government must take aggressive action to combat and prevent the spread of this disease in the United States,"" the Congressmen wrote the President. The congressmen, who were primarily Republicans but included three Democrats, note that the disease could spread in the U.S. as infected individuals might not show symptoms for 21 days after being exposed to the deadly virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

"(CNN) -- Fast food and some retail workers in 50 cities around the country are striking today, and have mounted dozens of strikes over the past few months. Their demands are simple: a pay raise to $15 per hour -- roughly double the federal minimum wage -- and union recognition. The ""Fast Food Forward"" movement began in New York City last fall and quickly spread to other cities. In some places it grew to include workers in other low-wage jobs besides fast food. Like the earlier Occupy Wall Street protests, this new movement has captured the imagination of millions of Americans angry about the ever-widening gap between haves and have-nots. But unlike Occupy, with its youthful base and reliance on new social media, Fast Food Forward was born from a marriage of old-fashioned unionism and community organizing. Its protagonists are ordinary workers, many of them black, brown and/or female. They are struggling to support their families on jobs that pay at or close to the legal minimum, with few benefits. Adding insult to injury, full-time work is hard to find in the fast food and retail world. But many workers have no other options, since the Great Recession permanently wiped out millions of better-paying jobs. The federal minimum wage dates back to the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act - part of FDR's New Deal. But inflation has eaten away at the guarantee it was meant to provide. In today's dollars, the minimum wage is worth less now than it was half a century ago. Meanwhile, what FDR called ""organized money"" has been on the warpath against another legacy of the New Deal: organized labor. Today only 6.6% of private-sector workers are union members, less than any time since the early 1930s. That's another reason income inequality has soared. But the labor movement refuses to die. Instead it is struggling to reinvent itself. Fast Food Forward is backed by the giant Service Employees International Union, which boasts more than 2 million members and is known for its creative organizing tactics. Back in the 1990s the union's Justice for Janitors campaign lifted standards in another low-wage sector, winning union contracts that improved pay and benefits and converted part-time building service jobs to full-time ones in cities around the country. As organized money has successfully choked off the traditional road to unionism through the system created by the 1935 National Labor Relations Act under FDR, unions have turned to strategies from the community organizing tradition. In the case of the fast food strikes, for example, the union partnered with established community-based groups like New York Communities for Change. Similarly the Our Walmart campaign, which led the Black Friday walkouts at the nation's largest retailer last November, uses community organizing tactics rather than standard unionization methods. Both Fast Food Forward and Our Walmart rely on strategies and tactics perfected by the ""worker center"" movement that sprang up starting in the1990s. It includes dozens of community-based organizations representing taxi drivers, domestic workers, day laborers, street vendors and others at the bottom of the labor market. Many of these workers are excluded outright from New Deal laws like the FLSA and NLRA, since technically they are not ""employees"" but ""independent contractors."" The worker centers have successfully spotlighted the many abuses such workers suffer, and have helped them organize. But as community-based groups with shoestring budgets and tiny staffs, the scale of their work has been severely limited. Still, some have managed to form national organizations, like the Restaurant Opportunities Center and the National Domestic Workers Alliance. One of them the Taxi Workers Alliance, is now formally affiliated with the AFL-CIO, which has developed other partnerships with worker centers in recent years. If old-line labor unions - which despite their declining membership, still have relatively deep pockets and political clout - keep stepping up their support for such efforts, that could be a real game-changer. That's the significance of the fast food walkouts: They could be the embryo of a new labor movement that challenges the power of organized money and the skyrocketing inequality that has made the American middle class an endangered species. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruth Milkman.","Ruth Milkman: Fast food and retail workers are walking out to seek better wages .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Thousands of residents of the southeastern Spanish city of Lorca slept outside Wednesday night, hours after the city of about 80,000 was struck by an earthquake that killed eight people, state radio reported, citing authorities. ""It was a strange sensation,"" said a press office worker who was in his office in the regional capital of Murcia, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Lorca. He estimated the duration of the quake from five to eight seconds. The 5.1-magnitude quake occurred at 6:47 p.m. (12:47 p.m. ET) and was centered about 50 kilometers (31 miles) southwest of Murcia, near the Mediterranean coast, the U.S. Geological Survey said. That is about 350 kilometers (218 miles) south-southeast of Madrid. It was preceded at 5:05 p.m. (11:05 a.m. ET) by a 4.5-magnitude temblor centered in the same area, the survey said. At least one of the deaths occurred in a building collapse in Lorca, state-run EFE said. Television pictures showed the belfry of an old church collapsing soon after the earthquake, as well as fallen bricks on top of damaged cars there. Buildings with broken windows and piles of rubble in the streets of Lorca could also be seen. The press office said a hospital in Lorca had been evacuated as a precaution. Many of those who were spending the night outside said they were afraid to return to their houses or had been advised not to do so, state radio said. The quake occurred during an election campaign for Spain's 8,000 town mayors and most of its regional governments, with voting scheduled for May 22. The two major parties called for a suspension of campaigning on Thursday out of respect for the victims. CNN's Al Goodman and Juan Munoz contributed to this story.","Thousands of people are sleeping outside in southeastern city of Lorca .

"(CNN) -- At least 58 people in Syria were killed Tuesday in ""terrorist"" mortar and car bomb attacks in the city of Homs and the Damascus area, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. A car bombing in Homs' al-Zahra neighborhood killed 40, SANA reported, citing an unnamed source in the area. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group, also reported many casualties, including women and children, in the car bomb attack. It described al-Zahra as an Alawite neighborhood. Syria's President Bashar al-Assad is a member of the Alawite religious sect, which is an offshoot of Shia Islam. In Damascus, mortar rounds hit the al-Shaghour neighborhood. Two slammed into the Badr-Eddin al-Hooni Institute for Islamic Sharia Sciences, killing 14. Four people were killed in a mortar strike at a center for displaced people in the Damascus countryside. Three of those killed were children. Scores of people were wounded in the violence. The unrest comes amid Syria's three-year civil war pitting government forces against rebels trying to end the rule of al-Assad. The government often refers to rebels as armed terrorists bent on destabilizing the country. The government announced this month that new elections would be held June 3. But that may not yield any change in a country where al-Assad's family has had a tight grip on power for 43 years. Al-Assad succeeded his father in 2000 and won a second term in 2007, unopposed. More than 100,000 people, including many civilians, have been killed in the war. Chlorine gas attack claims . The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons announced Tuesday that it would investigate claims the Syrian government may have used chlorine gas in a deadly attack on its people this month in Hama province. ""The Syrian government, which has agreed to accept this mission, has undertaken to provide security in areas under its control,"" the OPCW said. ""The mission will carry out its work in the most challenging circumstances."" The team is expected to leave for Syria soon and has the backing of the United Nations, the statement added. If confirmed, a chlorine attack would undermine a deal brokered by Russia last fall and approved by the U.N. Security Council that requires Syria to surrender its chemical weapons to the international community. The agreement halted threats of U.S. military action after allegations Syria launched a chemical attack last August that killed over 1,400 people. Al-Assad and other officials have vehemently denied their forces were responsible. The Syrian opposition does not have helicopters to carry and deliver such weapons, and has been trading accusations with the government about the April 11 incident. Controversy followed video clips posted on anti-government websites showing a number of civilians, including children, appearing to have difficulty breathing and using oxygen masks. The chemical symbol for chlorine, Cl2, is visible on the side of a canister that opposition activists say was used in the attack. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said last week that the United States ""had indications of the use of a toxic industrial chemical, probably chlorine, in Syria this month in the opposition-dominated village of Kfar Zeita."" She added, ""We're examining allegations that the government was responsible."" Analyst: 'A likely deliberate tactic' In a report Tuesday, analyst Firas Abi Ali of IHS Country Risk cited several claims in international and opposition social media that the Syrian government has stepped up its use of chlorine gas against civilian and military targets in Idlib, Hama and Damascus provinces since April 15. IHS has not been able to confirm the reports independently, he said, but they have been corroborated by videos showing civilians suffering symptoms associated with chemical weapons use. ""If confirmed, it indicates that Assad assesses that he can use these weapons with impunity, given U.S. unwillingness to intervene directly, and reflects his own forces' overstretch in the face of opposition offensives in Daraa, Aleppo and Latakia,"" he said. ""Moreover, the use of chemical weapons is a likely deliberate tactic intended to highlight to the civilian population the severe cost of supporting the insurgency."" Chlorine is not listed as a chemical that Syria is expected to give up under the Security Council resolution. But its use as a weapon of war is prohibited under the 1925 Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria has signed. More than 90% of Syria's chemical weapons material has now been removed or destroyed, the OPCW said Thursday, ahead of the June 30 deadline agreed to under the international deal. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","NEW: Mortar and car bomb attacks killed nearly 60 people, report says .

"(CNN) -- A prominent Egyptian activist says that continued sexual assaults of women protestors shows the Mubarak regime's ""culture of violence"" towards women remains unchanged in Egypt today. ""For years Mubarak's regime was torturing women, harassing women, detaining mothers and daughters and wives of prisoners to put pressure on them,"" said Mozn Hassan, director of the research organization Nazra for Feminist Studies. ""For sure it's the culture of the SCAF (Supreme Council of the Armed Forces). ""It's a culture-based violence towards women. They want to exclude us from the public. The SCAF want to give the message that revolutionary people, if they are men, they are thugs, if they are women, they are sex workers and prostitutes."" More: Egypt braces for last-chance protests . Well-known American-Egyptian journalist Mona Eltahawy was left with a broken left arm and right hand after what she describes as a ""brutal beating"" and sexual assault by Egyptian riot police Wednesday. Eltahwy says the attack took place in Tahrir Square while she was covering the protests. ""Right now my left arm is broken and my right hand is broken and this is as a result of a brutal beating by the Egyptian riot police. ""A group of riot police surrounded me -- about five of them -- and they beat me and their big sticks kind of rained down upon my arm and that's why it's broken because I was trying to protect myself. ""And they also sexually assaulted me -- I was groped all over my body. I lost count of the number of hands that tried to get into my trousers. ""They dragged me to the Ministry of the Interior ... they dragged me by the hair, called me all kinds of insults,"" she said. Eltahawy says she was detained there for for 10 to 12 hours, first by ministry officials and then by military intelligence. More: Film shines a light on sexual harassment . She says that sexual assault has long been used by the Egyptian security forces as a weapon against women. ""Egyptian security services have used sexual assault to try to intimidate women from street protests and activism and for years now Egyptian women have bravely spoken out. ""I'm taking this chance to shame them, to shame them for what they did because when I was being assaulted by those riot police officers, it was as if I was set upon by a bunch of beasts,"" she said. Colonel Islam Jaffar, Head of the military's Morals Department in Central Cairo said he saw Eltahawy and spoke to her during her detention. He said that she had no Egyptian press pass that identified her as a reporter while she was in Tahrir Square taking photographs and reporting on clashes between protesters and the police and army. He said: ""What did she expect? She could be a spy for all we know. When she told me she was sexually assaulted I encouraged her to take the appropriate legal action."" Eltahawy is not the first prominent Egyptian female to accuse security forces of sexual assault in the recent violence in Egypt. More: Ten must-read blogs from the Middle East . Bothaina Kamel, Egypt's only female presidential candidate and a strident opponent of military rule, says she was the victim of sexual assault by soldiers after she joined a protest near Tahrir Square on Sunday. Kamel, a former television presenter, told CNN, with her husband Ashraf El Baroudi, a judge, translating, that she was arrested and ""beaten all over"" and ""touched"" sexually by army officers. She said that some officers recognized her and tried to dissuade others from carrying out the assault: ""They (some officers) don't want to punish me or to beat me (because they know) I will talk to all the world."" Kamel said the army and police have been brought up on a ""culture of torture and not respecting human rights."" ""We made a revolution to stand against all the phenomenon of bad behavior and what happened was we removed Mubarak ... but we are still living under the umbrella of the same regime,"" she said. Following her assault Kamel returned to Tahrir Square to participate in the uprising, urging the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to make way for a civilian government. An Egyptian army spokesman said Thursday Kamal Ganzouri had agreed to become Egypt's prime minister and will form a new government. More: Would-be prime minister no stranger to Egyptian government . Feminist activist Hassan said that since the revolution, Egyptian women were ""experiencing a new public space."" ""Before that, based on the cultural values we have been raised on, women had to be protected and didn't used to be in the public."" She said about 1,000 women had marched on Tahrir Square Tuesday to reassert women's position at the forefront of the revolution. ""It's important to give messages that we are not afraid and we are willing to die,"" said Hassan. ""We will be in the front, defending the revolution and defending other women and men."" She added that in the tumult since January, certain voices were still trying to drive women out of public life, ""because we have been raised like this."" But she said many women had decided not to retreat into the domestic sphere as was expected of them. ""Some people thought the culture-based discrimination we had been raised on could be changed in 18 days,"" she said. ""Now they know it's a long struggle. Eighteen days is not changing a society. This is about continuing the revolution."" Hassan believes that by remaining front and center, women activists were gradually helping to shift cultural attitudes around gender roles. But the attitude of the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) in its treatment of women remained unchanged from the Mubarak era. Human Rights Watch says the Egyptian military has not investigated or prosecuted anyone for the sexual assault of seven women by military officers in the military prison in Hikestep in March. An unnamed general admitted to CNN in May that the military had subjected the women to ""virginity tests."" ""We didn't want them to say we had sexually assaulted or raped them, so we wanted to prove that they weren't virgins in the first place,"" he said. ""The girls who were detained were not like your daughter or mine. These were girls who had camped out in tents with male protesters in Tahrir Square, and we found in the tents Molotov cocktails and (drugs)."" Heba Morayef, the organization's researcher in Egypt, said that in many ways women had been sidelined since the beginning of the revolution in January. She said: ""Have they been excluded from key decision-making posts? Has there been a failure to prioritize participation of women in the transitional mechanism set up by the military? Yes.""

"(CNN) -- Where better to start a record-breaking solar powered flight than the desert? The UAE may be one of the most oil dependent states in the world, but next March it will be the start and finish location for Solar Impulse 2, a solar-powered plane that aims to circumnavigate the world using only the power of the sun. The Solar Impulse made headlines last year when, piloted by co-founders Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg, it took a solar-powered trip across the United States. A single-seater plane fitted with 12,000 solar cells and four electrically-powered propellers, it was also the first aircraft powered by renewable energy that could fly non-stop for 24 hours. The next version, the Solar Impulse 2, will have 17,000 solar cells built into the wings that have a span longer than a Boeing 747. The plane is expected to make the round-the-world trip in around four to five months, with some legs lasting as long as 120 hours non-stop. The first and last stop will be Abu Dhabi. ""This well-matched partnership will show Abu Dhabi to be a center of expertise when it comes to renewable energy,"" said Piccard in an official statement. ""At the same time, Solar Impulse will demonstrate the far-reaching applications of clean energy during the first solar-powered flight around the world."" Masdar, Abu Dhabi's renewable energy company, is also a partner in the project, and will help the Solar Impulse team train and test the aircraft before it takes to the skies. ""Abu Dhabi, Masdar and Solar Impulse have in common a pioneering spirit, a long-term vision and a desire to explore new horizons,"" said Dr. Sultan Ahmad Al Jaber, Masdar's chairman, and the UAE minister of state, also in an official statement, adding: .

"(CNN) -- Bruce Levenson couldn't cut it as a successful NBA owner. His business, the Atlanta Hawks, was failing. He needed a scapegoat, and he blamed African-Americans, his most loyal customer base. Apparently, he forgot those fans are the only group that has stuck by him in spite of the inferior product he's put on the basketball court since he took over the team 11 years ago. He should be grateful any fans showed up for the games at all. His first mistake, among many, has been forgetting that Hawks have been barely a smidgen above mediocre for as long as any sports fan can remember. Philips Arena is dull; the overpriced concession food is awful. And no matter what anyone says about ""Hotlanta,"" football (college first and then NFL) will always be king in that city. So if you are going to invest in the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA, a league that boasts the highest share of black television viewers, at 45% -- three times higher than the NFL or NCAA basketball -- and a player roster that is nearly 80% black, well, then you better have a smart business strategy to keep your core customers happy and attract corporate dollars at the same time. What we know . Levenson, it seems, had no winning strategy. The ""self-reporting"" bigot seems to have awakened one day, looked around the City of Atlanta (which according to the 2010 census is 54% African-American and 38.4% white) and decided that all of his business failures in Atlanta had nothing to do with his own mismanagement of the team. He then sent a racist, ranting email to his business partners, outlining his personal theories about how their failing franchise might be turned around. Levenson has apologized for his tirade and said he will sell his controlling interest in the team. ""I wrote an e-mail two years ago that was inappropriate and offensive,"" Levenson said in a Hawks news release. ""I trivialized our fans by making cliched assumptions about their interests (i.e., hip hop vs. country, white vs. black cheerleaders, etc.) and by stereotyping their perceptions of one another (i.e., that white fans might be afraid of our black fans). By focusing on race, I also sent the unintentional and hurtful message that our white fans are more valuable than our black fans."" But I take his apology with a large grain of salt. Though his rambling email was incoherent and ill-advised, in hindsight at least, it reads as though it is the words of a man speaking from his heart. In fact, it turns out Levenson's decision to sell his interest in the team was triggered by the discovery of his inflammatory email by an outside law firm reviewing the organization, according to CNN reports. In professional sports and in business, winning is everything. Nothing else counts. And when Levenson and his partners realized that the arena was half-empty, the first questions Levenson should have asked are: Will sports fans pay money to watch this team play? And what are my successful competitors doing to attract more customers? Well, according to the Hawks website, the average ticket price is $103 per game, and the average fan and corporate packages run from $599 to $4,499 per season. I'm not sure about Levenson, but I could definitely find a better way to spend my hard-earned cash and my time than driving to an arena to watch a losing team. Levenson's downtown pro sports neighbors, the Atlanta Falcons, are certainly having no problem thriving in an urban environment where it is necessary to court African-American customers. The Falcons, who have posted five consecutive winning seasons, including four trips to the playoffs, sell out nearly every game, and they do so in part because they intentionally put a smart strategy in place to attract their African-American fanbase. Successful teams across sports in cities like New York, Washington and Los Angeles are using this same multicultural business strategy to run winning franchises. Levenson is now getting undeserved credit for reportedly going first to the NBA to confess that he sent the racist email before it was exposed. The league, to its credit, in the wake of the Donald Sterling disaster, had been vetting other team owners who fostered climates of discrimination and bigotry behind closed doors. Therefore, clearly, Levenson had a compelling reason to come clean about his 2-year-old email. Opinion: Levenson and the Hawks' real problem . Sterling was forced to sell the Los Angeles Clippers over the summer when racist audio recordings came to light. He defended himself then, saying that he was not the only NBA owner to harbor prejudice attitudes. And there's no arguing that he was right. Despite its leading record in the sports industry on diversity hiring, both on and off the court, the NBA is no stranger to the controversial topic of race in sports. It is ironic that Levenson, touted as a public do-gooder, has missed his own message of tolerance and understanding. This year, he took his NBA team the Holocaust museum in Washington. The players even met Levenson's mother-in-law, Irene Boyarsky, a concentration camp survivor. Levenson said then: ""Having them come here and having them see the faces of bigotry and hate, it's important. For them to learn lessons of this museum and of the Holocaust means a lot to me."" Tolerance is a pretty word we like to use. But in real life, it takes courage, humility and commitment to live by it. Whether the topic is homophobia, gender equality or religious intolerance, Levenson certainly is not the first person whose public actions have fallen short of their private hearts. But Levenson's brand of public hypocrisy is not just morally corrupt, it is bad for business. And the NBA is big business. Thanks to strong leaders like NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and his predecessor David Stern, who have implemented tough love but racial compassion, the league has not only preached but mostly practiced racial tolerance. It's a smart strategy because without African-American fans, and the talented men who play the game, there is no league. And today, the best companies are looking for a way to diversify and grow their customer base. I say good riddance to Levenson and other NBA owners like him, of which I think there are few. And kudos to Silver and others who are working to root out racist owners. ""As Mr. Levenson acknowledged, the views he expressed are entirely unacceptable and are in stark contrast to the core principles of the National Basketball Association,"" Silver said in a statement Sunday. Call me overly optimistic, but I believe that most NBA owners are decent people. And more important, they are shrewd businessmen who understand that in today's global economy, a company that doesn't not have the cultural intelligence to build a diverse customer base will fail. In 1903, W.E.B. DuBois poignantly wrote in ""The Souls of Black Folk,"" ""for the problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color-line."" And today, as America's face shifts from white to shades of brown, it remains to be seen whether we will ever stop stumbling over that line, fearing the line, hating that line, so we can finally stand together as one strong nation.","Roxanne Jones: Bruce Levenson's email revealed NBA owner scapegoating blacks .

"(CNN) -- The military in the West African nation of Burkina Faso seized control of the government on Thursday and set a dusk-to-dawn curfew in what one general described as an effort to protect lives and restore order. Unrest has gripped Burkina Faso -- a key ally for the West in the fight against al Qaeda -- as protests against President Blaise Compaore's government turned violent, culminating Thursday with demonstrators storming the Parliament and setting fire to the building. Saying it was in the best interest of the country's citizens and supported by ""national and international opinion,"" Gen. Honore Nabere Traore told reporters in the capital city of Ouagadougou that the ""government is dissolved."" ""An interim authority will be set up in order to prepare the conditions for the return to normal constitutional order within a period of 12 months at the latest,"" Traore said. The whereabouts of Compaore were not immediately known, and it was not immediately clear whether he had surrendered control of the country. Earlier in the day, Compaore took emergency measures, asking in a government communique read on national radio for an end to the violence. He also withdrew a proposed constitutional amendment that included a provision that would allow him to seek another term in office, according to the communique. Compaore, who has been in office since he took power following a bloody coup in 1987, also made an appeal via Twitter, urging for a return to calm. But it was unlikely to placate the opposition, which called for his immediate resignation. In Bobo-Dioulasso, the country's second largest city, protesters reportedly tore down a statue of Compaore. The incident followed reports that a large group of protesters had stormed the Parliament building, where lawmakers were set to vote on a motion to allow Compaore to extend his 27 years of rule. Footage aired by a number of the country's media outlets show the Parliament building engulfed in flames. There have been reports of casualties in the violence, but CNN has not been able to independently confirm the claim. Flights in and out of Ouagadougou have been suspended, according to the Burkina Faso Embassy in Washington. Embassy personnel told CNN that it was still issuing visas but that there were no flights at the moment. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on all groups to end the violence, asking that they ""exercise calm and restraint."" The West, particularly France, considers Burkina Faso a key ally in the fight against al Qaeda. The country was formerly known as the Republic of Upper Volta, when it was established in 1958 as a self-governing colony under France. France urged restraint in the current situation. The French Foreign Ministry condemned the violence. The African Union announced it would deploy troops alongside United Nations forces as part of a joint mission to address the unrest.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- After jarring clashes between pro-democracy protesters and opponents in Hong Kong's densely populated Mong Kok district Friday, student leaders called off talks with the government, accusing police of allowing the violence to happen. ""The path of conversation should be put aside now. The government is not honoring its promise and it should be held accountable first,"" the Hong Kong Federation of Students said in a statement. Pro-democracy activists accuse Beijing of exerting too much influence on Hong Kong and are demanding the right to directly choose candidates for elected office -- rather than the newly instituted policy giving the central government veto power over eligible candidates -- and other reforms. Students had hoped to meet with the No. 2 official in Hong Kong's government, Chief Secretary Carrie Lam, in an effort to resolve the political crisis that has gripped the semiautonomous Chinese territory for a week. Protester Edward Tsoi said that after some students had been beaten and others sexually molested as police stood by and watched, they had lost all faith in government officials. ""The government and the police have done nothing to stop them,"" he told CNN. A police spokesman rejected the protesters' claims, saying police had tried to fairly and neutrally manage a chaotic situation. At least 12 people were injured in the clashes in Mong Kok, including six officers, according to the police. (In the seven days of protest, 148 people have been injured.) Police official Kong Man-keung told reporters Friday that police were struggling to deal with a quickly developing situation and did their best. He reiterated requests for protesters to disperse, but protest leaders said they would do nothing of the sort. ""Now, the government is declaring that it will stand firm in clearing the occupied areas,"" the student federation said in its statement. ""And we ask Hong Kong people to come and protest all these areas and we will fight to the end and we're not going to succumb."" Demonstrators on both sides of debate . The clashes broke out Friday in Mong Kok, a tightly packed neighborhood of shops and residences where protesters have occupied one of the city's busiest intersections. Witness Jessica Cheung told CNN the trouble began around noon when ""a 30-something-year-old man"" began ""causing a scene."" After him came a bunch of ""middle-aged men"" who burst into the area saying, ""''You're in my way, I have to go to work, I have to make a living.' "" The men, who did not appear to be from the area, tried to tear down protesters' tents and got into scuffles with them, Cheung and other protesters said. Another activist, Wilson Wong, called the crowd encircling the protesters intimidating. ""We just want a peaceful dialogue, but we're scared because they're using violence,"" he said. ""We're very nervous and our hands are shaking, even as we hold on to each other."" The crowds opposing the protesters in Mong Kok expressed anger about the disruption posed by the demonstrations, which have choked one of the busiest intersections in Hong Kong. ""They've been here for nearly a week. They need to clear out. It's ruining our economy, they just need to leave,"" said one of them, Joe Lee. A similarly minded crowd gathered Saturday at the police headquarters, though there were no clashes with protesters in this case. ""We need order. We know what they want. Why do they still stay?"" said one of them, retired police officer Yan pak Yu. ""Go to the park. Go the playground. Don't obstruct the daily operations of Hong Kong."" Crowds grow 'exponentially' after clashes . Meet the 17-year-old student agitating for change . At least 20 people arrested at the protest were suspected of crimes, including fighting in public places, unlawful assembly and assault, police said. Hong Kong's police superintendent warned that demonstrators should clear the busy Mong Kok intersection or face arrest. Police will begin dismantling protest barriers, and anyone remaining at the site could be arrested, Superintendent Mok Hing-wing said at a news conference broadcast by Hong Kong media. Despite the warnings, the crowd at the site grew ""exponentially"" after the clashes, Kong said. On Saturday morning, things had calmed down considerably, but a couple hundred protesters remained at the scene. The protesters are employing a strategy to call other students over if they perceive a possible threat. Hong Kong protests: What's next? Earlier, Hong Kong Chief Executive C.Y. Leung said there was no current plan to clear the remaining protesters, their numbers significantly reduced from the massive crowds that turned out on public holidays the previous two days. ""Currently, we do not have any plan, but as I ... said, nowhere else in the world would tolerate protesters surrounding government headquarters indefinitely,"" he told reporters. Protest demands . Demonstrators are upset with a recently enacted policy giving Beijing veto power on who can run as a candidate for the chief executive role in the 2017 election. A new electoral system will, for the first time, let the city's 5 million eligible voters pick a winner, rather than a 1,200-member committee stacked with Beijing loyalists that has chosen past leaders. Critics argue that the right to vote is pointless if the candidates are handpicked by Beijing. They complain the Chinese government is encroaching too much on the affairs of Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory ruled according to the ""one country, two systems"" policy since the 1997 handover from Britain. Leung's steadfastness against the protesters' demands has led them to call for his resignation. But he's had support in Beijing, with a high-ranking Chinese official has denounced the protests as ""illegal acts"" while reiterating China's view that what happens in the special administrative region is purely a domestic matter. How tear gas united Hong Kongers . It remains unclear how long the protests can maintain support and continue to draw the numbers that have so far clogged main arteries. The crowds are getting smaller during the daytime when most of the protesters go home to shower and refresh. If the students ""drag this on for a really long time, they're going to start losing some of their support,"" David Zweig, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said as he stood at the main protest site. CNN's Michael Pearson, Elizabeth Joseph, Madison Park, Euan McKirdy, Ray Sanchez, Esther Pang, Anjali Tsui, Jethro Mullen, Greg Botelho and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Friday clashes in Mong Kok district leave 12 injured .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama is promising a more aggressive approach to containing Ebola in the United States. A second worker with Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital is identified as a 29-year-old nurse. The nurse flew on a Frontier Airlines flight Monday, before showing signs of the disease, and the CDC is trying to contact all passengers aboard the flight. With multiple developments underway, here's what you need to know to get caught up on the latest in the Ebola outbreak: . U.S. DEVELOPMENTS . President Obama promises more aggressive approach . After the second Ebola infection at a Texas hospital, President Barack Obama announced Wednesday: ""We're going to make sure that something like this is not repeated, and that we are monitoring, supervising, overseeing in a much more aggressive way exactly what's taking place in Dallas, initially, and then making sure that the lessons learned are then transmitted to hospitals all across the country."" The President also said he's ""absolutely confident that we can prevent a serious outbreak of the disease in the United States,"" but said it's harder to do as the disease rages out of control in Africa. CDC forms Ebola response team . Obama said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's new rapid response team will help hospitals that don't have experience with Ebola. ""I think what we've all learned over the last several weeks is that folks here in this country in a lot of nonspecialized hospitals and clinics don't have that much experience dealing with these issues. So we're going to have to push out that information as aggressively as possible,"" Obama said. ""We will put a team on the ground within hours,"" CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said earlier. Such a team, Frieden said, might have prevented Dallas nurse Nina Pham from contracting the disease. Second Texas worker tests positive . A second health care worker at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas who provided care for Thomas Eric Duncan has tested positive for Ebola. The worker has been identified as nurse Amber Vinson, 29, according to officials at the CDC. Vinson was transferred Wednesday to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta for treatment and is ""ill, but clinically stable,"" the CDC said. Ebola patient flew on a Frontier Airlines flight . Vinson flew from Cleveland to Dallas on Monday on Frontier Airlines Flight 1143, the day before she was confirmed to have Ebola and in violation of a CDC order. Health care workers exposed to Duncan can travel, but not on a commercial airline, Frieden said. A statement from the airline said Vinson displayed no symptoms or sign of illness during the flight. CDC is trying to contact passengers . The risk to passengers aboard the flight with Vinson is low, according to the CDC, because she wasn't showing any symptoms of Ebola, but officials want to interview all 132 passengers who were on the plane. The CDC said it wants to speak only with people aboard the Monday evening flight, and not the flight Vinson took to Cleveland on Friday, October 10. Frontier Airlines Flight 1143 flying again . Frontier airlines removed Flight 1143 from service after learning about the Ebola patient. The plane was back in service Wednesday after undergoing a decontamination process, said Ricky Smith, Cleveland's director of Port Control. Kent State University takes Ebola precautions . Three employees who work at Kent State University are related to Vinson, according to the university. The college, out of an abundance of caution, has asked Vinson's ""family members to remain off campus for the next 21 days and self-monitor per CDC protocol, said Dr. Angela DeJulius, director of university health services at Kent State. DeJulius stressed Vinson, a Kent State graduate, ""did not step foot on our campus"" during her Ohio visit. Recuperating nurse is doing better . The first Dallas health care worker with Ebola, Pham, is in ""improved condition,"" Frieden said Wednesday. She is receiving treatment at Texas Health Presbyterian and it's unclear whether she may be moved to another facility. Obama participates in international video conference . Obama stressed the need for ""a faster and more robust international response to the Ebola epidemic and underscored the need to increase assistance and international contributions"" to the West African nations at the epicenter of the outbreak: Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, according to a White House statement. Officials with Britain, France, Germany and Italy participated in the call Wednesday. Major allegations against Texas hospital . The guidelines were constantly changing and ""there were no protocols"" at Texas Health Presbyterian, the co-president of National Nurses United said. It's here that Ebola patient Duncan died, and two nurses contracted the virus caring for him. Protective gear that nurses initially wore left their necks exposed, they felt unsupported and unprepared, and they received no hands-on training, nurses union co-president Deborah Burger said. The hospital said compliance and employee safety are its priorities. Should Duncan have been moved? Duncan should have been transferred immediately to either Emory University Hospital in Atlanta or Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, an official close to the situation said. Those hospitals are among only four in the country that have biocontainment units and have been preparing for years. ""If we knew then what we know now about this hospital's ability to safely care for these patients, then we would have transferred him to Emory or Nebraska,"" an official said. Military reservists could be activated to fight Ebola . The Obama administration is expected to announce Thursday that it will authorize the Pentagon to call up reservists to help with the United States' effort at fighting Ebola in West Africa, according to an administration official. The Pentagon has the authority to send up to 4,000 troops to the region to help battle the crisis. New York Police Department issues Ebola directive . New York police officers received a directive on how to identify potential Ebola patients and what to do if they come into contact with an infected person, an official with the New York Police Department told CNN. The instructions describe symptoms of the illness, how to interact with the potential victim, the importance of wearing protective gear and how to dispose of it. Complete coverage of Ebola . WEST AFRICA DEVELOPMENTS . Expect 5,000 to 10,000 new cases . The World Health Organization estimated that there will be 5,000 to 10,000 new Ebola cases weekly in West Africa by the first week of December. As of Tuesday, there had been 8,914 cases and 4,447 deaths, but WHO said the total is underreported. The mortality rate in the outbreak is 70%, WHO said. U.S. troops battle invisible enemy in Liberia . IN OTHER COUNTRIES . U.S. seeks use of Spanish bases . The United States is seeking permission to use Spanish bases to help in transport and logistics support for the U.S. military mission to help fight Ebola in West Africa. American transit and logistics flights have already been approved case-by-case by Madrid, but Washington hopes for a more blanket agreement. A spokesman for Spain's Defense Ministry told CNN's Al Goodman that Spain has approved some flights from its Rota naval base and Moron air base to West Africa, but not yet any return flights from West Africa. The Spanish defense minister is scheduled to meet U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel in Washington on Friday. Spanish nurse's assistant serious but better . Teresa Romero Ramos, a nurse's assistant in Spain who showed Ebola symptoms after treating an Ebola patient at her Madrid hospital, still is in serious condition, but doing better, officials said this week. Romero spoke to her husband by phone for 10 minutes, family friend Teresa Mesa told reporters. Romero has been drinking water, and doctors are hopeful about her condition, Mesa said. Spanish authorities are monitoring more than 80 potential Ebola cases: 15 in hospitals and the rest at home, according to the Spanish Ministry of Health. None of them is showing symptoms of Ebola, the ministry said Tuesday. CNN's Dana Ford, Catherine E. Shoichet and Anna Maja Rappard contributed to this report.","President Obama promises a more intensive response to the Ebola crisis .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A man wearing a hooded sweatshirt shot two men at a North Hollywood synagogue on Thursday morning, wounding them in their legs, police said. The two men, who have not been identified, are in stable condition at separate hospitals, said Deputy Chief Michel Moore of the Los Angeles Police Department. Authorities took a juvenile into custody whose clothing matches ""a loose description"" of what the suspect was wearing, police said. He was released later Thursday pending further investigation. Police said he was cooperative with authorities. ""We have eliminated no one and that includes the teenager who was detained,"" said Lt. Alan Hamilton. ""He was basically released to school because he is a juvenile and cannot be detained for more than six hours. But we are not actively investigating him as a suspect in this shooting case at this time."" Police have put extra patrols near local schools and other synagogues as a precaution, he said. ""We are looking into every possible motive,"" Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Ramon Villaraigosa said. ""But at this point, all we know is that it was a random act of violence."" The shooting occurred about 6:20 a.m. at Adat Yeshurun Valley Sephardic Synagogue, police said. Moore said the two victims, ages 38 and 53, arrived at the synagogue's parking garage in separate vehicles. As they were parking, he said, a man in a black sweatshirt approached, pulled out a handgun and fired on the first victim. The shooter then fired on the second victim and fled, Moore said. ""We don't know whether this was a robbery or whether it was an attack on these two individuals because of their presence at this synagogue,"" Moore said. He said he believed that the two victims were arriving at the synagogue for morning prayers. Authorities are reviewing security video from the synagogue, he said. Authorities had interviewed the victims, said Jorge Villegas, assistant commander for the Los Angeles Police Department.","NEW: Juvenile taken into custody and released pending investigation, police say .

"Washington (CNN) -- Texas is leading a group of 17 states -- all but two with Republican governors -- that are suing to block President Barack Obama's executive overhaul of U.S. immigration and deportation rules. The state's incoming governor, Greg Abbott, announced the effort to have courts block Obama from implementing the actions he announced last month during a Wednesday afternoon news conference. ""The constitution prescribes immigration policy be fixed by Congress -- not by presidential fiat,"" said Abbott, the Texas attorney general who won the governor's race in November and has since become the highest-profile GOP critic of Obama's immigration policies. Poll: Obama's immigration policy popular, but approach isn't . He said Obama's decision to stop deportations for undocumented immigrants who are the parents of U.S. citizens -- the centerpiece of the executive action -- is ""a decision to openly tolerate"" violations of the U.S. law. ""Texas is uniquely qualified to challenge the president's executive order,"" Abbott said. He pointed to Obama's 2012 order deferring the deportation of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children and had lived in the country for years, and said Texas has seen an influx of immigrants since then. Mayors back Obama immigration action . ""Basically, we are asking for the court to require the president to go through the prescribed constitutional process of enforcing laws passed by Congress rather than making them up himself,"" Abbott said. Abbott said the states joining Texas in the lawsuit are Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin. He said other states could join the lawsuit.","Incoming Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is challenging President Barack Obama's immigration action in court .

"Sioux Falls, South Dakota (CNN) -- Rick Weiland says when he was walking down the street making the music video for the song he wrote, a woman stopped him and thought he was country crooner Merle Haggard. You can't blame her for being confused. It's not every day a candidate for Senate plays the guitar and puts his campaign message to song, let alone make a music video. ""I'm running for the Senate but I ain't a big wheel. I don't have an RV just my automobile. Hey, hey, no one's bought me,"" sings Weiland in the folksy, cheeky video. ""It got 39,000 hits on You Tube,"" Weiland tells us proudly, saying his son produced it. The Democratic candidate says singing for the Senate is a good way to communicate, and helps show South Dakota voters who he really is. He now keeps his guitar in the car and pulls it out at rallies, like he did this week before an event with Sen. Tom Harkin of neighboring Iowa. Country-singing Senate hopeful 'rocks' South Dakota race . But he also does it out of necessity. Until recently he has been left for political dead by his national party in his bid to keep this open seat in Democratic hands. South Dakota's Senate race was supposed to be a shoe-in for the Republicans -- one of three guaranteed pick ups in their quest to gain 6 six Senate seats to capture the majority. West Virginia and Montana, the other two, still seem like sure bets for the GOP, but South Dakota is suddenly iffy. There are many reasons that the contest has shifted into a four-way race that includes former Republican Sen. Larry Pressler, now running as an independent, and tea party candidate Gordon Howie. As a result, it has been hard for Republican candidate Mike Rounds, a former two-term governor, to consolidate his party in this right of center state. Rounds is also under fire for abuses in South Dakota, during his time as governor, of a federal program to swap green cards for business. He told CNN, as he has before, that he did nothing wrong and has nothing to hide, but he concedes the questions about it have taken a toll on his campaign. ""It is one way to say 'big scandal,' suggesting a big scandal and that takes away from the issue of Obamacare and making it an issue, it takes away from the Keystone XL pipeline and getting it built and these are things that Democrats in South Dakota are absolutely on the wrong side of it,"" Rounds said. Several Republican strategists and high ranking officials in Washington tell CNN that Rounds' problems have been compounded by the fact that he was slow to fight back. He has always run campaigns without attack ads and didn't want to start now. When we put that criticism from fellow Republicans to Rounds, he chuckled. ""We appreciate their input, we can learn as well, but there is also a way to win in South Dakota. We've won in the past, we think we're still on top of the way we think people in South Dakota want to see campaigns won,"" Rounds said. Pressler, an independent, thinks he knows how campaigns are won here too. He was a Republican senator for 18 years, and the At-Large Representative before that. 'Cowboy poetry' on the plains: An off beat senate candidate . But he was defeated 18 years ago, and admits the world has changed a lot in that time. Pressler says the GOP in South Dakota got too conservative and the Senate he once served is paralyzed with partisanship. That's why he wants to run for just one more term, to help change it. ""Well it's a very bitter place,"" he said in an interview. But the more flux this race is in, the more Pressler is attacked from all sides as a spoiler -- especially by the GOP. They're reminding voters Pressler supports the president's signature health care law and voted for the Democratic president twice. Pressler won't say which party he would caucus with if he wins the Senate seat. Some Democrats here are worried he will take votes from Weiland, especially because another concern is that he is too liberal for South Dakota. He scoffs at that, saying that's ""national conventional wisdom -- the same national conventional wisdom that said this state was lost."" CNN's Adam Levy contributed to this report .","A race for an open Senate seat in South Dakota was supposed to be an easy GOP pickup.

"(CNN) -- The pilot killed in the Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo disaster moved an unlocking device earlier than he should have, investigators said. But that alone might not have caused the spaceship to disintegrate 45,000 feet in the air, killing co-pilot Michael Tyner Alsbury and injuring co-pilot Peter Siebold, who managed to parachute to the ground. While the the National Transportation Safety Board said it is ""months and months away"" from determining the cause, it outlined two problems involving the spacecraft's ""feathering"" -- a process used to slow the spacecraft down toward Earth. In order for feathering to start, two things have to happen: someone has to unlock the feathering system, and someone has to activate the system with a different handle. The NTSB has said the unlocking device was moved too early. On Monday night, the agency said Alsbury was the one who unlocked the feathering system. ""... the copilot, who was in right seat, moved the lock/unlock handle into unlock position; he did not survive accident,"" the NTSB tweeted. ...the copilot, who was in right seat, moved the lock/unlock handle into unlock position; he did not survive accident. #SpaceShipTwo . But that mishap alone doesn't explain why the feathering started, since no one moved the feathering handle. During feathering, two pieces on the back of the vehicle -- the ""feathers"" -- lift up perpendicular to the spaceship, making the vehicle look like it's arching its back as it descends. Branson mourns pilot, says space travel worth its risks . Plastic fuel . A team of 13 to 15 investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board will be in the Mojave Desert for about a week. But analyzing the data from the test aircraft will take much longer, and the investigation may take up to a year. Opinion: The truth about launching spaceships . Friday's flight was the first to use a new plastic-based fuel, something that CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien has said could have affected the plane's stability, despite the fuel tanks being found intact. O'Brien said that Virgin Galactic had ""consistently underestimated the risk involved."" But Virgin founder Richard Branson denied this, saying that 400 ""of the best engineers in the world"" were working on the project and that the risks were similar to those taken by people flying across the Atlantic in the 1920s and '30s. Investigation may take up to a year . Veteran pilot killed . A memorial fund has been set up for Alsbury's family. He worked at Scaled Composites, the company that partnered with Virgin on the test flight program, and logged more than 1,600 hours as a test pilot and test engineer in Scaled aircraft. Analysis: Will space accidents deter pioneer tourists? Scaled Composites said Sunday that co-pilot Siebold -- the company's director of flight operations -- was alert and speaking with family and doctors. SpaceShipTwo helmed by experienced pilots when flight failed . Future of the program . For years, Virgin Galactic had planned to sell trips in which SpaceShipTwo would transport passengers about 62 miles above Earth -- the beginning of outer space -- and let them experience a few minutes of weightlessness before returning to the ground. Virgin Galactic planned to send paying customers on SpaceShipTwo as early as next year and has sold more than 700 tickets, each costing more than $250,000, for future flights. Deadly day for space tourism -- but future 'rests' on such days, official says . Several celebrities have already signed up, including Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher, Leonardo DiCaprio and Stephen Hawking. Friday's tragedy was not the first fatal accident to hit the Virgin Galactic space program. In 2007, three employees of Scaled Composites were killed during testing in the Mojave Desert. Sources told CNN that they had been testing components of a new rocket motor for SpaceShipTwo.

"San Diego (CNN) -- President Obama's critics have the right to be upset by his decision to shield from deportation, at least temporarily, some groups of undocumented immigrants. But they don't have the right to twist the facts, use inflammatory language and create confusion. They're the ones who are most confused. They don't appear to have the foggiest idea how the process would work. That's their own fault. They should have paid closer attention two years ago, the last time the administration did something like this, with the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Simply put, Obama is using the executive power granted to him by the Constitution to reshuffle the immigration enforcement deck and prioritize deportations so that, for instance, the undocumented parents of U.S.-born citizens get a temporary ""deferred"" status and thus can't be removed for three years. But you should read the fine print. There are a lot of strings attached, and there is no guarantee that some of these people won't be deported. It's a crap shoot for undocumented immigrants, which explains why only a little over half of the young people who were eligible for DACA took the risk and applied for it, according to the Migration Policy Institute. No one can say what will happen when Obama's new deferment expires. A lot will depend on the political mood at the time, and what the new president will decide, in 2017, to do with immigrants who are holding these deferments. There could be extensions offered, or it could be the end of the road. If it's the latter, a large number of undocumented immigrants -- media reports have put the potential figure at 5 million, although the actual figure is likely to be much lower, given the response to DACA -- will be deportable once again. The administration has said that the new program -- which it is calling DAPA, Deferred Action for Parental Accountability -- would work much the same way as its predecessor, DACA. Obama announced that program in June 2012 and it took effect about six months later. Under DACA, undocumented young people brought here as children can apply for a two-year ""deferred action"" that lets them remain in the country temporarily without fear of being deported. Yet there is a catch -- when you deal with government, there's always a catch. I'll explain what it is in a minute. But first, let's listen to what has been coming from the sky-is-falling chorus in the Republican Party. Obama's conservative critics really do say the darnedest things. A recurring theme is that Obama is acting outside the law, rewriting the law or ignoring the law. When I asked one conservative commentator to explain, he said: ""Well, there was a law on the books that said a person can't be in the country illegally? Now they can. Because Obama changed it."" Nonsense. He did no such thing. Obama merely applied to the enforcement of immigration laws something that all police, prosecutors and judges have: discretion. Now it turns out I have to explain this simple concept to Obama himself. This week, the President responded to hecklers at a speech in Chicago who were demanding that he ease up on deportations by insisting that he had just taken action to ""change"" the law. Meanwhile, law professors and other legal experts have come forward to say that Obama did not, in fact, change the law and that he has the Constitution on his side when it comes to using executive power. Conservative critics are wrong that he went so far as to ""change"" the law, and Obama was wrong to agree with them. Other critics went even further and suggested that Obama wasn't just changing the law but actually ""canceling"" it. More nonsense. No president can cancel a law, or repeal a law, or strike down a law. Only Congress can do that. But this brings us back to the ""catch"" in Obama's executive action. Those of us who have interviewed DACA recipients and studied how that program works will find it difficult to take seriously the concerns raised by critics who are unfamiliar with the subject matter. You see, while the administration hasn't yet released the procedures for applying for DAPA, White House officials have said that the new program will be modeled on DACA. This means that qualifying for this temporary reprieve from deportation won't be a walk in the park. Here's what happens under DACA: The first thing that an undocumented immigrant must do is contact the friendly neighborhood office of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and declare that he or she is in the country illegally. Immigrants who do that are then subjected to background checks and fingerprinted. Files are created with their names on them, where the government will keep their home addresses, the names of their employers, if any, the names of everyone else who lives in their houses, etc. Then each application is considered by USCIS officials, and either approved or denied. If the application is approved, under DACA the immigrant could remain in the United States for three years -- unless the policy is rescinded by a future president. If it is denied, there is no appeal and the government has all of the immigrant's personal information. So much for staying in the shadows. So tell me again how Obama is ""canceling"" existing immigration law. If that is the case, then how it is that the whole process for obtaining deferred action for DACA -- and likely for DAPA too -- begins with undocumented immigrants, in essence, surrendering to authorities? If immigration law is really no longer in effect, why do these people have to bother turning themselves in at all, getting fingerprinted and all the rest? Also, if immigration law is really being repealed, then under what authority will immigration agents be deciding the fate of DAPA applicants? In fact, if the immigration law is canceled, wouldn't these agents be out of a job? After all, once you strike down a law, it's difficult to enforce it. You think all this makes for a sweet deal for the undocumented? Not exactly the free ride that Obama's critics think it is -- that is, if they were thinking at all.","Navarrette: Critics can disagree with Obama immigration action, but should get facts right .
He says use of executive power to defer deportations is not ""changing"" or ""canceling"" the law .
He says under DACA, and likely DAPA, immigrants turn selves in, risk deportation if rejected .

"(CNN) -- B.J. Novak's first children's book tops the New York Times list of best-selling children's picture books. But here's the catch: It actually doesn't have any pictures. That gimmick, together with Novak's celebrity status, has helped make ""The Book with No Pictures"" a bedtime story favorite for the elementary school set. The 35-year-old actor is best known for writing, directing and producing episodes of the hit show ""The Office."" As the title of his book suggests, ""The Book with No Pictures"" lacks illustrations. But it features silly sayings such as ""My only friend in the whole wide world is a hippo named Boo-Boo Butt"" and ""My head is made of blueberry pizza,"" designed to delight kids. ""The Book with No Pictures"" is not Novak's first foray into fiction. He also published a book of humorous short stories, ""One More Thing: Stories and Other Stories,"" in February. He has plans for many more works of literature, which could include a collaboration with a former ""Office"" co-star and reported former flame: ""There's something I'd like to write with Mindy Kaling, a book of letters back and forth of our arguments,"" Novak says. ""Ideas for books, I have a million."" For now, Novak is returning to his roots in standup comedy to promote ""The Book with No Pictures."" His tour is taking him to a range of elementary schools across the country, including his alma mater, Mason Rice, in Newton, Massachusetts. He spoke to CNN about his new book, his future plans and his tour, in which he lets his young fans share the spotlight with him. Below is an edited transcript. CNN: How did you decide to bring kids on stage with you during your tour? B.J. Novak: The school events are the most exciting to me because generally, they're assemblies where they bring all the kids, K through 3, in. They've never met an author before. And most excitingly, I get to read the book to a super concentrated group of little kids. And it's like they're in a comedy club, more than they're being read a book. There's something about live comedy, where they're practically elbowing each other, like ""Did you hear that?"" ""Are you seeing what I'm seeing?"" It really brings back my standup days to me, except it's for 5-year-olds. I really do feel like I'm on a comedy tour. CNN: What made you decide to write a children's book? Novak: If you've ever been a comedian, you have this addiction to laughter. The laughter of children is the most powerful drug of all. If you get hooked on that, you're really in trouble. While I was waiting for ""One More Thing"" to come out, I would hang out with friends who had kids. At one point, my best friend's son, Bruce, who was 2 years old at the time, toddled up to me, holding a book out. And something in my brain asked: ""What is his dream? What are the dream words in this book?? He doesn't know what's in this book unless he's read it before. He has the power to decide what the adult says. He's basically a little Harvey Weinstein, producing this experience, and I'm just the actor for hire. He's handing me a script. What is his dream script? Then my mind just went to: His dream would be that I would have to say all these ridiculous things I didn't want to say. He would feel delighted and be in complete control. That was the first notion for the book. Then when I thought: What would the pictures be? I realized I didn't have any vision for pictures and didn't need pictures. Then the whole vision came together. What if the message and the challenge of the book was: What can you do without pictures? What can you do with the power of words? CNN: How long did the process take? Novak: I had the idea and put it in this notebook I carry around filled with hundreds of ideas. One Saturday, or one day when I didn't really have anything to do but wait, I wrote up the whole thing. And I printed it on full-sized paper. And then I went to a stationery store, and I bought an empty book. I'm not a designer by trade, but I did my best. I chose the font and the size and the spacing. I glue-sticked the cover page on. And I paper clipped the pages in, enough to make a 2-year-old think that it might be a real book. And I did all this all in one day. And then I took it over to Bruce, and I asked if I could read him this new book. Then I read him the book. He was patient, and he laughed a couple of times, and then he said, 'Now let's read a book with pictures.' Then I went through some editing. It was six months on and off of design questions. At first I thought, a book with no pictures, great. No cover question, no title question, no design question. Just put the words out there. But in fact I soon realized when there's nothing to look at but letters on a page, and you're trying to make the youngest of kids stare at the page, it's actually very hard, and you have to be very particular. CNN:  Has your standup experience helped with the book tour? Novak:  The standup is everything. I really do feel that this is a tour of elementary schools. A good comic has the philosophy: Funny is funny, and never blame the audience. More than ever, kids are kids: Newton, Massachusetts; Harlem, New York; Texas; Chicago -- I've never seen crowds react so universally to anything as when they're 5, 6, 7 years old. Whatever age kids become different, it's later than this age. The later I can delay that, the better. It's really exciting and wonderful. More than ever, I know exactly where a laugh is going to come, where a cheer is going to come, where a call and response is; what line to hold a little longer. It's really stunning how a 5-year-old in one part of the country will be totally the same as kids from a totally different part of the country. And that's very standup-like.","B.J.

"(CNN) -- Time has effectively stood still in the Ukrainian city of Pripyat, which was evacuated in the aftermath of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear explosion. At the time of the disaster during the Soviet era, about 49,000 people lived in Pripyat, located less than two miles from the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. They left behind schools, homes, factories, parks and gyms that have remained largely undisturbed for the past 30 years. Armed with a camera and a dosimeter Geiger counter, cinematographer Danny Cooke explored the remains of Pripyat and Chernobyl. He pieced the footage together in a three-minute video that boasts drone footage of sweeping shots of abandoned buildings and parks. He also photographed building interiors on foot, capturing haunting scenes of empty schools and homes. Cooke visited Pripyat and Chernobyl in June while working for CBS News on a ""60 Minutes"" episode. He created the video to showcase his camerawork from the shoot for his portfolio. Postcards from Pripyat, Chernobyl from Danny Cooke on Vimeo. It was his first time there, though he has memories of Chernobyl's effect on his family living in Italy at the time. ""The nuclear dust clouds swept westward towards us. The Italian police went round and threw away all the local produce and my mother rushed out to purchase as much tinned milk as possible to feed me, her infant son,"" he said. ""It caused so much distress hundreds of miles away, so I can't imagine how terrifying it would have been for the hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian citizens who were forced to evacuate."" The visit was a life-changing experience, he said. ""It's very hard to explain, however, I feel different from when I set foot into the zone to when I left. My perspective of life changed slightly,"" he said in an email to CNN. ""On approaching the zone, I was aware that radiation is an invisible sensation but regardless my body reacted in a psychological way. My brain was telling me that perhaps I'd made the wrong choice and this wasn't such a good idea,"" he said. ""It was too late to go back now, but I'll never regret ever entering the zone. The sight of the school canteen floor in Pripyat will be something I will never forget in my lifetime. What the evacuees must have gone through is unthinkable.""

"(CNN) -- A fiery crash in California left a sports car almost completely unrecognizable and its occupants lucky to be alive. The 2002 Ferrari crashed in Calabasas on Friday night after veering off a road, hitting two trees. A California Highway Patrol news release says Edmond Evan Aslin, 44, was driving the black Ferrari at a high rate of speed around 10 p.m., when the car veered to the left. The car then entered a grass median, struck two trees and continued into the opposite lanes before coming to a stop. No other vehicles were involved in the crash. During the accident, the car burst into flames. The crash left behind the twisted and charred remnants of the vehicle. The CHP report says the driver is hospitalized with major injuries at West Hills Hospital and his passenger escaped with moderate injuries. It's unclear what caused the driver to lose control of his car. Ferrari is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer founded by Enzo Ferrari. The company, famous for its Formula 1 vehicles, started building street-legal versions in 1947. The cars typically cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, with some fetching more than a million dollars. The cars are also highly collectible. Earlier this year, a 1962-63 Ferrari GTO Berlinetta was sold in California for $38 million, the most ever paid for a car at auction.","Two people survive serious Southern California highway crash .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration is leaving the door open to a possible expansion of the U.S. military mission in Syria, with the possibility of targeting not just ISIS but also al Qaeda-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra. While there are no active U.S. military plans for airstrikes against al-Nusra targets in Syria, neither the Pentagon nor the White House has rejected that idea as a possible future option, a senior U.S. official tells CNN. ""Nothing is off the table completely,"" the official said. The possibility of strikes against al-Nusra -- the al Qaeda affiliate in Syria -- was first reported by the Washington Post. Senior U.S. military officials are making it clear the Pentagon is not anxious to undertake such strikes, knowing it would legitimately be seen as so-called mission creep, the official said. When asked by CNN's Jim Acosta, White House press secretary Josh Earnest seemed to leave the door open, however. ""The United States remains concerned about all threats emanating from Syria, including the threat that's posed from by the Nusra Front. That's driven by the fact that ... the Nusra Front has been public in threatening the West,"" Earnest said Tuesday. ""But what we will continue to do here in the United States is to work closely with our coalition partners to take strikes in Syria that are focused principally on denying a safe haven to those extremists and organizations that are seeking to do harm to the United States of America or our allies."" Hagel wrote memo to White House criticizing Syria strategy . Striking al-Nusra would have the goal of pushing back its advances against moderate Syrian rebels who the United States is backing in the fight against ISIS. The Pentagon has repeatedly said it sees the U.S. military priority as striking ISIS in both Syria and Iraq with the goal of ensuring Iraq does not fall to ISIS control. But getting Syrian opposition into fighting shape to challenge ISIS has been a slow and complicated process due to the need to verify the security credentials of Syrian fighters going through the program. More than four months after announcing an effort to train and equip the moderate Syrian opposition, the U.S. military has yet to vet a single Syrian rebel to fight ISIS on the ground. ""There's progress in setting up curriculum, there's progress in getting the sites ready, there's progress in getting trainers contributed to the effort -- not just from the United States but from other nations,"" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said Tuesday. ""But the vetting progress has not begun yet. Kirby added that the program ""has not been completely codified,"" but did not go into detail on how or when that process might unfold. The idea of mounting a train-and-equip program for the moderate opposition was first floated over a year ago, in the aftermath of revelations that the Assad regime used chemical weapons against Syrian civilians. But it was not until June of this year, when the terror group ISIS started making significant territorial gains in Iraq, that the Obama administration backed the plan, asking Congress for $500 million to ""train and equip appropriately vetted elements of the moderate Syrian armed opposition."" Opinion: What would Reagan do? Prior to that, the U.S. had been providing nonlethal material and light weapons to the moderate opposition. The effort is part of a $1.5 billion initiative the United States is undertaking with a number of regional partners. Kirby also told reporters that the U.S. military is making significant progress in its overall efforts to degrade and destroy ISIS. In particular, Kirby said, the Iraqi army is making meaningful territorial gains with help from U.S. advisers, and U.S.-led efforts are helping disrupt the group's revenue and degraded its ability to maneuver, communicate and operate inside Iraq. ""Nobody is saying that it's over. There's a long way to go here,"" Kirby cautioned. ""But they've definitely felt ... the full weight of the pressure that's being put on them.""","An expanded mission could target not just ISIS but also al Qaeda-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra .

"United Nations (CNN) -- On Tuesday, it was climate change. Wednesday, terrorists. And on Thursday, President Barack Obama confronted yet another emergency that threatens wide destruction overseas: the Ebola outbreak spreading in West Africa. Crisis management has become a hallmark of Obama's second term, perhaps seen nowhere better than at the annual United Nations General Assembly, where the world's leaders -- and their attendant calamities -- converge upon New York. Obama's three main issues here -- climate change, ISIS and Ebola -- each has the potential to rapidly spiral out of control, officials suggest, with the effects of a warming planet already being registered and Americans overseas already being killed both by terrorists with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and by the deadly virus spreading in Africa. Ebola patients left to lie on the ground . Hoping to demonstrate to fellow leaders his government's handle on the problems, Obama said Wednesday that the U.S. ""will not be distracted or deterred from what must be done"" when it comes to helping solve the world's problems. But throughout his 48 hours at the United Nations, Obama made clear he wasn't going to take it all on himself. ""We cannot do this alone,"" he said during remarks at a session on combating Ebola, which has struck three countries in West Africa and prompted a large-scale U.S. military effort to stop its spread. CDC: Ebola cases could reach at least 550,000 by January . ""We don't have the capacity to do all of this by ourselves,"" he said, adding, ""I hope I'm properly communicating the sense of urgency here. Do not stand by thinking that somehow because of what we've done, that it's taken care of. It's not."" That warning of the limits to U.S. power is broadly the same message Obama wanted to deliver on climate change and ISIS, which he focused on this week. Both threats, Obama said at various points, will require coalitions of governments to act rather than the U.S. alone. U.N. Security Council unanimously passes anti-terror resolution . ""Nobody gets a pass"" when it comes to reducing carbon emissions, Obama said, singling out China as a country that has a ""special responsibility"" to figure out ways of emitting fewer gases that scientists believe lead to global warming. As he directs the U.S. to rein in pollution from coal-powered plants, Obama hopes other nations that emit large amounts of carbon will follow along, though commitments from China, India and Russia have been modest. Without firm plans from those countries to reduce carbon use, climate experts say, there's little hope of turning around warming trends that threaten the global population. Marchers sound urgent call for climate change ahead of U.N. assembly . So, too, will the threat from ISIS be contained only through coalition pressure, Obama and his aides maintained at the U.N. ""We cannot do this for you"" was his message to newly elected Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi during a meeting Wednesday, saying that any resolution to Iraq's problems could come only from a lasting, inclusive government. The coalition of Arab countries that joined in the U.S. air campaign over Syria -- a victory for Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry -- can help ""de-legitimize"" the ideology espoused by ISIS, U.S. officials say, making the group an essential part of Obama's war plan. ""This is not America's fight alone,"" he said Tuesday before leaving for the global gathering in New York. The long, slow fight against ISIS: Airstrikes, failures on the ground . Commitments have been forthcoming, including a unanimous vote at the Security Council for new standards in stemming the flow of foreign fighters. But even that measure will be hard to enforce, underscoring the difficultly in getting even like-minded nations moving in the same direction. ""Resolutions alone will not be enough,"" Obama said. ""Promises on paper cannot keep us safe. ""The words spoken here today must be matched and translated into action, into deeds -- concrete action, within nations and between them, not just in the days ahead but for years to come.""","Obama made clear at the U.N. that the U.S. isn't going to take the world's problems alone .

"(CNN) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter has admitted that he did know about alleged bribe payments made to former FIFA executives, but insists he didn't think they were illegal at the time. ""You can't judge the past on the basis of today's standards. Otherwise it would end up with moral justice. I can't have known about an offense that wasn't even one,"" he told the website of football's world governing body. A Swiss court has published its findings following an investigation into alleged illegal payments made by FIFA marketing partner International Sports and Leisure (ISL) to former FIFA president Joao Havelange and former executive committee member Ricardo Teixeira. The report found that Havelange had received at least 1.5 million Swiss francs ($1.53 million) and Ricardo Teixeira was paid at least CHF 12.4 million ($12.64 million) from marketing partner ISL. Blatter was FIFA's general secretary at the time of the alleged irregularities, and in that role he co-signed agreements with the marketing group. Blatter has confirmed that he is the ""P1"" character investigators referred to in several key points of the report. The investigators specifically identified ""P1"" as someone who knew about the illegal payments. ""It was confirmed by the former chief financial officer of FIFA ... that a certain payment made to Joao Havelange by the Company 1 amounting to CHF 1 million was mistakenly directly transferred to a FIFA account; not only the CFO had knowledge of this, but also, among others, P1 would also have known about it,"" the report stated. However, Blatter defended his involvement on the FIFA website in a move that shows the 76-year-old is making some effort to keep the promises of greater transparency he made after being re-elected in 2011. ""Back then, such payments could even be deducted as a business expense,"" he said of ISL's transactions, which were made between 1999 and the company's collapse in 2001. ""Today, that would be punishable under law."" However, one of FIFA's critics insists that Blatter should take more responsibility for the ruling body's actions. ""The FIFA president has a serious moral compass problem. You are looking at an organization whose culture is tolerant of impropriety,"" David Larkin, co-director of campaign group Change FIFA, told CNN. ""The president is trying to defend acts that would not be tolerated anywhere else."" FIFA has been keen to point to its active involvement in the case, declaring on Wednesday in a response to the document's publication: ""The decision by the Federal Court is in line with what FIFA and the FIFA president have been advocating since 2011, when world football's governing body announced its commitment to the publication of the ISL non-prosecution order."" Blatter highlighted the formation of an Ethics Committee, an adjudicatory body and an investigatory body, and told the FIFA website that ""some important steps have already been taken."" However, Larkin described FIFA as ""the least qualified people to investigate"" the allegations against it.","FIFA President Blatter admits he knew about payments to former FIFA officials .

"(CNN) -- The Nevada Supreme Court Friday upheld former football player O.J. Simpson's convictions for kidnapping with a deadly weapon and other charges in his 2008 Las Vegas armed robbery trial, but ordered a new trial for co-defendant Clarence Stewart. Simpson, 63, is now serving a 33-year sentence with the possibility of parole after nine years for 10 convictions relating to an armed confrontation over sports memorabilia in a Las Vegas hotel room. Simpson and five other men tried to regain property that Simpson claimed was his. That 2008 Nevada conviction came exactly 13 years after Simpson was acquitted in Los Angeles, California, in the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. In his Nevada appeal, Simpson unsuccessfully argued that the trial court erred when prosecutors were allowed to remove two potential jurors who were African-American. Simpson also alleged the trial court improperly restricted him from asking potential jurors about the notorious California murder trial and a subsequent wrongful death civil suit accusing him of causing the two deaths. Simpson also contended the Las Vegas trial court improperly admitted hearsay statements. ""We conclude that all of Simpson's arguments on appeal are without merit and we therefore affirm the judgment of conviction,"" Nevada's high court said in its ruling. On September 13, 2007, Simpson and five men held two individuals at gunpoint and removed about $100,000 worth of trophies and other sports memorabilia from a Las Vegas hotel room. ""The testimony was clear and consistent: Simpson was furious"" at a third individual whom Simpson believed had betrayed him by selling his personal items, the court wrote when addressing the assault and robbery convictions. ""Once the robbery was over and all of the items were removed from the room, Simpson remained in the middle of the room yelling at the victims"" while a conspirator held the victims at gunpoint, the justices wrote. Of the five men who accompanied Simpson to the Vegas hotel room, four pleaded guilty to reduced charges in exchange for their testimony at trial, but Clarence ""C.J."" Stewart faced a jury verdict alongside Simpson. Stewart argued that he should have received a separate trial. Stewart was also convicted on 10 counts and received an identical 33-year prison sentence as Simpson, but the Nevada Supreme Court agreed with Stewart's attorneys and ordered a new trial. ""We conclude that the district court did abuse its discretion when it denied the motion to sever (Stewart's trial from Simpson's) because it prejudiced Stewart by having a substantial and injurious effect on the verdict, and we therefore reverse the judgment of conviction,"" the court wrote.","Nevada Supreme Court finds Simpson's arguments ""without merit""

"(The Frisky) -- Zillions of famous married men have affairs. Some actually stayed with their mistress. Prince Charles . Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles met at a polo match in 1970 and dated for a little while. They split, though, and went on to marry others -- Charles famously got hitched to Lady Diana in 1981. However, he and Camilla started secretly seeing each other in the '80s. Charles and Diana finally divorced in 1996. Though Charles and Camilla stayed together, they kept a low profile, especially after Princess Diana died. It wasn't until 2005 that they walked down the aisle together. Brad Pitt . Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie aren't married and say they have no plans to do so. But they've been together for five years and have three biological children together and adopted two others jointly. The two reportedly fell in love on the set of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" when he was still married to Jennifer Aniston. The Frisky: I slept with your husband -- here's why . Mel Gibson . When Mel Gibson's almost 30-year marriage went belly-up, he wasted no time bringing his new woman, Russian pianist Oksana Grigorieva, out in public. Within a month, he confirmed that Oksana was pregnant and they had a baby together in December. But, naturally, they've split. Rumor has it that Mel was unfaithful to her, too. Humphrey Bogart . Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall first teamed up on the movie ""To Have and Have Not,"" when she was 19 and he was 45. They fell in love and began an affair -- Bogart was unhappily married at the time. After they shot their second movie together, Bogart filed for divorce and the two were married. Howard Hawks famously said of them, ""Bogie fell in love with the character she played, so she had to keep playing it the rest of her life."" Ethan Hawke . Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke seemed like the perfect couple -- heck, they met on the set of the most awesome movie ever, ""Gattaca."" But in 2004, they divorced and both seemed pretty tortured by the decision. Rumors flew that Ethan was having an affair with a 22-year-old model. But it turns out things were even worse; he allegedly was getting too close to the family's own nanny, Ryan Shawhughes. He also went on to marry her and they had a baby together in 2008. The Frisky: 10 stars who (maybe) have secret babies . Tiki Barber . Tiki Barber didn't just cheat on his wife who is pregnant with twins -- he left her at the 8-months-pregnant mark for the other woman, Traci Lynn Johnson, who started out as his intern at NBC. Only time will tell if these two stay together, but for now, they're on. Donald Trump . Many years before ""The Apprentice,"" Donald Trump fired his first wife, Ivana Trump, in favor of his mistress, Marla Maples. Which led Ivana to utter her legendary line: ""Don't get mad. Get everything."" Ryan Phillippe . Ryan Phillippe was reportedly close to ""Stop-Loss"" co-star Abbie Cornish when Reese Witherspoon filed for divorce. Soon after, Ryan officially began dating Abbie. Amazingly, the two stayed together for three years, just splitting recently. Steve McQueen . ""King of Cool"" Steve McQueen reportedly cheated on his first wife with Ali McGraw and married her after getting divorced. Then he allegedly cheated on Ali with model Barbara Minty. He went on to marry Barbara, but sadly died less than a year later. The Frisky: Another celeb Photoshopped into thinness? Billy Crudup . Billy Crudup became public enemy number one when he left a 7-months-pregnant Mary-Louise Parker for the much younger Claire Danes. Again, the new couple had some staying power, though, lasting from 2004 to 2006. At which point, Claire fell for a Billy lookalike, Hugh Dancy, on the set of ""Evening"" and reportedly began an affair with him. Hey, what goes around comes around.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Most Saudi Arabia citizens interviewed in a poll oppose terrorism and want closer ties with the United States. But many Saudis remain opposed to making peace with Israel, according to what researchers call an unprecedented survey of the kingdom. People sell traditional items at a Saudi market. A poll indicates Saudis have turned against Osama bin Laden. Ten percent of Saudis have a favorable view of the al Qaeda terrorist network, according to a survey by Terror Free Tomorrow, an international public opinion research group based in Washington. Fifteen percent said they have a favorable view of al Qaeda's leader, Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the poll found. ""I think that the people of Saudi Arabia have so overwhelmingly turned against bin Laden, al Qaeda and terrorism in general that nine out of 10 of them look at all three unfavorably,"" the group's president, Ken Ballen, said Monday. Though the desert monarchy's ruling family has close ties to the United States, it was also the home of 15 of the 19 suicide hijackers behind al Qaeda's September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. The kingdom also has been the target of a spate of al Qaeda attacks since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the origin of a large share of the Islamic militants implicated in suicide bombings in Iraq. Pollsters questioned 1,004 Saudi adults in Arabic between November 30 and December 5, according to the group. The survey had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Saudis also have a better opinion of the United States than in other countries in the Muslim world, with 40 percent saying they view the U.S. favorably. That compares to 19 percent in Pakistan, according to a poll taken by the same group in August, and 21 percent of Egyptians, according to a May survey by the Pew Research Center. CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen said a spate of al Qaeda attacks on Saudi targets starting in 2003 appeared to have turned the Saudi public against the group. ""The results, while a little surprising, seem fair enough considering the circumstances,"" he said. But while the poll was encouraging, ""It's not all Kumbaya,"" he added. Bergen said a ""substantial minority"" of Saudis -- 30 percent -- support fighting against U.S. and coalition troops in Iraq, and 52 percent would support Saudi Arabia's development of nuclear weapons. Most Saudis oppose al Qaeda, the survey suggests, and it also found limited support for two other groups the United States has branded terrorist organizations -- Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic movement that rules Gaza, and Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim militia that fought a monthlong war with Israel in 2006. ""Finally, some good news,"" Ballen said. Thirty-three percent of Saudis viewed Hezbollah favorably, compared to 42 percent unfavorably. When asked about Hamas, 37 percent had a positive response, while 38 percent viewed the group unfavorably. But Ballen said the survey shows the Saudi population is now one of the most pro-American in the Muslim world, with 69 percent of those surveyed supporting close ties between Riyadh and Washington. ""We had done a limited survey there about a year and a half ago and found very strong anti-American attitudes, so I was quite surprised by the results,"" he said. The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq was seen as the most important step in improving U.S.-Saudi ties by 85 percent of those surveyed. Most Saudis said they opposed their countrymen fighting in Iraq and favored helping the United States reach an end to the nearly five-year-old war there. Support was also strong for increasing visas for Saudis to come to the United States, with 74 percent calling that a step that would improve their opinion. And 71 percent favored a free-trade pact between Washington and Riyadh, while 52 percent said a U.S.-brokered peace treaty between the Israelis and Palestinians would be an improvement. Saudi King Abdullah is the leading advocate of an Arab League proposal that would normalize relations with the Jewish state in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal to the frontiers it held before the 1967 Mideast War. But his support for a comprehensive Mideast peace ""definitely does not carry over at all,"" Ballen said: Thirty percent of Saudis support a peace treaty, even if it resulted in the establishment of a Palestinian state, the survey found. ""He's not backed by his own citizens on that,"" Ballen said. Saudis expressed support for a free press and free elections, though 79 percent also said they continued to support an absolute monarchy -- and 15 percent supported the recent sentence of 200 lashes and six months imprisonment of a 19-year old Shiite woman for being with a male acquaintance before she was gang-raped by seven men. Abdullah announced Monday the woman would be pardoned. Despite the kingdom's somewhat forbidding reputation among Westerners, Ballen said those contacted were far more receptive to pollsters than most Americans. The poll's response rate was 61 percent, compared to 10 to 15 percent for most U.S. surveys. E-mail to a friend .","Survey: 10 percent of Saudis polled have a favorable view of al Qaeda .

"(CNN) -- Residents of one of Syria's most war-ravaged cities demanded answers Thursday after a pair of devastating explosions killed dozens of children. The bloodshed Wednesday spurred mourning residents to demand the ouster of the Homs governor and his assistant, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. It spurred a Syrian official, Hilal al-Hilal, to visit the wounded and offer condolences to loved ones of the dead at the direction of President Bashar al-Assad. ""(These) heinous crimes against innocent children reflects the cowardice of the terrorists who have sought to kill science,"" al-Hilal said, according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency. An earlier SANA story said that an explosives-packed car was detonated minutes before a suicide bomber blew himself up in front of a school. The blasts were timed to coincide with students leaving school, to inflict maximum casualties, that report said. Horrifying video shows pieces of bodies lying on the street afterward, amid the injured and the scared. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group, said Thursday that at least 53 were killed in the blasts in Homs' Ekrima neighborhood, adding, ""the number of the dead is likely to rise (due) to the serious injuries."" Those killed include 46 children, most of them less than 12 years old; the United Nations reported that at least 30 of the dead were schoolchildren between the ages of 6 and 9. The neighborhood that was attacked is predominantly Alawite, a religious minority that is a Shiite offshoot to which al-Assad belongs. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, which U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called ""an act of the utmost depravity."" Whomever is to blame, the blasts shows that Homs is once again in the middle of war. For much of Syria's 3Â½-year civil war, the ancient city has been known as the capital of the uprising against al-Assad -- and it became a prime target for his forces as a result. U.N. humanitarian chief Valerie Amos estimates that as of September 30, the ongoing war has killed more than 190,000 people, and thousands more were thought to be trapped in a siege dating to June 2012. Yet the situation appeared to stabilize this spring after a truce between government and rebel forces. Since then, Homs has been firmly under government control and relatively quiet. But Wednesday's blasts shattered that sense of security and stability.

"(CNN) -- Australian cricketer Phil Hughes remains in a critical condition in hospital after being hit by a ball during a match in Sydney. The 25-year-old South Australia batsman, who has played for his country, collapsed after he was struck by a ""bouncer"" from New South Wales bowler Sean Abbott. The game was immediately halted as Hughes received treatment. He was eventually taken from the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) to the city's St Vincent's Hospital. ""Phil remains in a critical condition in intensive care. He's in the hands of some of the best specialists available for this type of injury so we'll just wait and see,"" said hospital spokesman David Faktor. The batsman underwent surgery on Tuesday, immediately after the accident, and his family and members of his cricket team remained with him at the hospital, Faktor added. Hughes was ""intubated"" by medical staff who flew by helicopter to the ground. The procedure involves inserting a tube into the body to enable that person to breathe. However, the hospital would not confirm media reports that the player was in an induced coma. Hughes was playing for South Australia against Sydney-based New South Wales, a team he represented between 2007 and 2012. ""As you are aware Phil Hughes was hit and injured by a bouncer at the SCG this afternoon,"" read a statement from Cricket New South Wales. ""He received immediate treatment at the ground led by CNSW and CA Chief Medical Officer Dr John Orchard. He was then taken to hospital by ambulance and is receiving the best available care. ""For privacy and accuracy reasons we are not in a position to discuss the medical details and we would be grateful if you would respect the privacy of the Hughes family and all the players at this time. ""Players and staff from both South Australia and New South Wales are obviously very concerned for Phil's health and, like Phil, are receiving appropriate support. ""Phil grew up in NSW and is a former Blue and is held in the highest regard by his current and former teammates. ""The thoughts and prayers of all at Cricket NSW and indeed everyone in Australian Cricket are with Phil the very best for a speedy and full recovery."" 'Freak accident' Hughes has played for his country in 26 Test matches, most famously against England in 2013. He shared a record 10th-wicket partnership of 163 runs with teammate Ashton Agar. After joining Middlesex in England in 2009, Hughes struck up a strong friendship with fellow batsman Nick Compton. Compton, who has represented England in nine Test matches, was shocked to hear of his friend's ""freak accident."" ""I feel sick, I feel devastated. I'm sitting here with a former colleague of mine and we just feel a bit numb,"" said Compton in a phone conversation with CNN. ""I've sent messages (to the family) but it's not a time when you want to get in the way. They've got more important things to worry about. ""Everyone is supporting him, there are a lot of well wishers out there. It's very difficult to know what the extent of the damage is."" Compton and Hughes lived together in London during their time as Middlesex teammates. ""We played together and got to know each other quite well,"" explained Compton. ""We ended up living together in West Hampstead. He's one of my best buddies, one of my best mates in the cricket. He's a great guy, a fantastic batsman."" The ""bouncer,"" a delivery which is pitched short so it bounces up at the batsman's upper body, is common tactic for bowlers to use in cricket. Despite Hughes' accident, Compton does not think cricket has a problem with head protection. ""It's awkward, it's part of the game. For the bowler, it's not his fault. It's one of those freak accidents,"" said the 31-year old. ""On another day, you do exactly the same thing and it glances off your helmet, you get a bit of a bruise, you feel a bit 'ugh' and that's about it. Every batsman has been hit at some point, some worse than others. It's worrying. ""It's the unpredictability of sport, that's what makes it what it is. It's a tough one to get right. If you want an absolutely risk-free occupation, don't play sport. ""The helmets these days are very well made. It's hit him in an absolute freak place."" Wickets harder, faster . The hot, dry conditions of an Australian summer, explains Compton, create hard pitches, which suit fast bowlers. ""Watching the footage, him falling flat on his face, it's not a nice image and it's horrible to see. It's probably more likely to happen in somewhere like Australia, where the wickets are harder and faster. ""It's a quick delivery that Phil's misjudged. Everyone wears a helmet these days and it's one of the risks of playing the sport. ""We all play the game and millions have got through their careers without being hit, this was just a horrific accident."" The Australian Cricketers' Association is talking to Cricket Australia about arranging counseling for anyone affected by the incident.","Australian cricketer Phil Hughes was struck by a ball during a match in Sydney .

"(CNN) -- Political systems in Africa are habitually characterised as nascent, highly personalized and fractious. Elections are portrayed as democracy at an embryonic stage. As Sierra Leoneans head to the polls for the third time since the end of the civil war in 2002, a different narrative is unfolding -- one of innovation and cutting-edge technology. An often overlooked aspect of the current electoral cycle in Sierra Leone is the use of biometric technology to capture thumb prints and facial features in the registration of voters. ""Credible elections start with credible voter registration,"" remarked Christiana Thorpe, chief commissioner of Sierra Leone's National Electoral Commission, during a presentation at Africa Research Institute in London in July 2011. For Thorpe, a bloated or inaccurate voter register always has a negative effect on the electoral process. The optical mark reader system used to register voters in Sierra Leone's 2002 and 2007 elections was manual and only catered for one-off registration. Voter identification cards, which relied on Polaroid photographs and a cold laminate seal, were vulnerable to tampering. Biometric systems allow for the creation of a permanent electronic register which can be updated as new voters become eligible or existing ones die. They capture data unique to an individual, in addition to biographical information, and can identify whether someone has registered more than once by centrally matching fingerprints. In Sierra Leone, the system allows for people to move to a different electoral constituency without the need to re-register. Biometric technology has been adopted to help address electoral fraud and increase the transparency, and credibility, of the electoral process. See also: DIY Africa: Empowering a new Sierra Leone . Biometric voter registration in Sierra Leone follows a regional trend. In 2005, ""La Commission Electorale IndÃ©pendante"" in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) used biometric technology to register more than 25 million voters ahead of the country's first democratic elections in four decades. In Nigeria, some 65 million people had their pictures taken and fingerprints scanned in preparation for presidential and legislative elections in 2011. Ghana registered more than 12 million voters using biometrics in 2012. In Kenya, after protracted disputes over procurement, 15,000 biometric registration kits have arrived ahead of the elections scheduled for March 2013. Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi, Rwanda, Senegal and Somaliland have also used biometric technology to register voters. Technology is only as good as the way it is deployed. In order to identify multiple registrations -- the principal merit of the system -- clean data must be submitted. Finger prints and photographs must be clear and unsullied, which requires trained and capable staff. For African countries conducting elections with strict -- and limited -- budgets, sophisticated technology is not always the best option. In the DRC, it is questionable whether the advantages of a biometric over a manual registration system justified the cost -- a staggering $58 million. In Sierra Leone, the integrity of the electoral register has still been questioned by opposition parties who accuse the government of covertly registering individuals under the legal voting age and foreign nationals. Acceptance of the voter roll ultimately depends on the political circumstances in the country. The greatest limitation of biometric voter registration is that it only counters the symptoms -- not the causes -- of electoral fraud. In Sierra Leone, there is no historical evidence of a deliberate strategy by any political party to rig elections through multiple registrations. All previous electoral registers have erroneously contained names of the deceased, the under-age and foreign nationals. But the most significant type of electoral misdemeanor has been physical stuffing of ballots and false recording of results by temporary election workers. Both the All People's Congress and Sierra Leone People's Party, when in power, have at times used their position to fund political campaigns and buy voters. This practice remains widespread. Political parties continue to organize and condone the intimidation of voters, often perpetrated by their youth wings. Biometric technology offers little scope to tackle these transgressions. Where electoral management is weak, manipulation of polls persists, regardless of the accuracy of the voter register. In Kenya's 2007 elections, incumbent president Mwai Kibaki defeated his main rival, Raila Odinga, by a margin of 230,000 votes. The result contradicted opinion polls and the parliamentary ballot. Allegations of systematic fraud and dysfunction, particularly within the Electoral Commission of Kenya (ECK), further discredited the elections. In the months leading up to the vote, President Kibaki replaced 15 of the 22-person ECK with new commissioners considered to be his close allies -- none of whom had experience running an election. In the immediate aftermath of the vote, election observers were barred from entering tallying centers for 48 hours. Election officials announced results from constituencies without supporting documentation from polling stations. Deficiencies with the tabulation of votes were so great that Samuel Kivuitu, chairman of the ECK, subsequently conceded that he ""did not know who won the election."" Expectations about technology's role in elections must be realistic. Biometric voter registration is not a ""silver bullet"" for eliminating fraud and electoral malfeasance. Where institutions are weak, and perpetrators of electoral crimes are not prosecuted, politicians can find ways to achieve undemocratic ends. Elections are more than just a technical exercise. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Jonathan Bhalla.","Many African countries using biometric voter registration, says Jonathan Bhalla .
In Sierra Leone, biometric technology has been adopted to help address electoral fraud.
Sophisticated technology is not always the best option, he argues ."
"(Mental Floss) -- 1. Da Vinci's clockwork car . A working model of Leonardo Da Vinci's car on display in 2004 at the Museum of the History of Science in Florence, Italy. Leonardo da Vinci is renowned for his forward-thinking sketches and intricate designs, which included blueprints for a bicycle, a submarine, and a helicopter. But you can't win 'em all. Da Vinci also designed a three-wheeled wagon-like device -- often referred to as the clockwork car -- that never really lived up to the hype. Its spring-operated design makes it the first-known concept for a self-propelled vehicle. And because it was designed without a driver's seat (though a secondary steering column was present) and was meant to be programmed along a specific course, the clockwork car is also thought to be one of the world's first robots. Some speculate that faulty interpretations of da Vinci's notes prevented the success of his ideas, but there's plenty of evidence to the contrary. When engineers finally constructed a working model of the car in the late 1990s, it only traveled 40 feet. 2. The monowheel . In 1869, French craftsman Rousseau of Marseilles built the first in history's line of unsuccessful monocycles. Sitting inside the monowheel, a rider steered the contraption by shifting his or her weight in the desired direction. As if that wasn't difficult enough, the massive outer wheel remained directly in the rider's line of sight at all times. Braking was also potentially hazardous, as stopping too abruptly would cause the rider to be propelled forward along with the outer wheel. But perhaps the biggest strike against the monowheel was the immediate comparison of any rider to a gerbil -- something even the French wouldn't tolerate. 3. The Daihatsu Trek . It's a car! It's a bed! It looks suspiciously like a child's toy! For the outdoorsman who has everything except a really expensive Big Wheel, there was the Daihatsu Trek. A single-passenger off-road vehicle, the Trek not only allowed drivers to travel to remote areas, it also gave them a place to bed down for the evening. With its collapsible seat, steering wheel, and roll bar, the boxy monstrosity from 1990 offered all the comforts of a really cheap motel room. And while we can't be sure why the car never made it past the concept stage at Daihatsu, we can only guess members of the off-road focus groups felt silly driving a Transformer. 4. The Avrocar . A quasi hot potato of international engineering, the Avrocar was initially funded by the Canadian government, designed by a British engineer, and eventually assumed by the U.S. Defense Department as part of the Cold War weapons race. The UFO-like contraption was 18 feet in diameter, but only 3 feet thick. It featured vertical takeoff and landing and was designed to reach speeds up to 300 mph while remaining elusive to radar. Unfortunately, the two-person craft was never able to stabilize at heights above 8 feet, nor travel faster than 35 mph. After eight years and more than $10 million, the project was abandoned in 1960. 5. The Dymaxion . Buckminster Fuller was many things --inventor, philosopher, Nobel Peace Prize nominee, and bearer of a name that makes Frank Zappa's kids feel average. Among his many architectural and engineering creations, Bucky tried his hand at automobiles. In 1933, using a V-8 engine loaned to him by Henry Ford, Fuller built the Dymaxion car. Truly a wonder to behold, the Dymaxion was nearly 20 feet long, got 30-plus miles to the gallon, held up to 12 people, had a maximum speed of 120 mph, and could do a U-turn in 20 feet, thanks to a single rear wheel that controlled the steering. Unfortunately, the car's steering appears to be at fault for a fatal accident at the 1933 World's Fair, when the Dymaxion was rubbernecked by another car. Although later evidence placed fault on the driver of the other car, negative publicity surrounding the wreck caused investors to pull away from the project, and Fuller was freed up to build geodesic domes and work on his friendship with John Denver. The fortunate outcome of the Dymaxion's failure? Denver's hit tune, ""What One Man Can Do,"" which was written for Fuller. 6. The KAZ . Originally designed in 2001 to push the limits of electric automotive technology, the KAZ (Keio Advanced Zero-emission) vehicle is part science-fiction, part sports car, part limousine, and entirely unattractive. But the beauty of the KAZ lies in its eight wheels, each powered by its own battery, which allow the luxury concept car to reach speeds in excess of 190 mph without emitting any pollution. The car's design also makes for a safe ride because what would normally be the engine compartment is a crushable zone, reducing risk to the driver. Sadly, the KAZ came off as less luxury automobile and more cartoon, sending the designers back to their drawing boards. E-mail to a friend . For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"(CNN) -- Whatever other resolutions we make leading up to the New Year -- to call Mom more often, lay off the late-night snacks -- getting ourselves organized is likely near the top of the list. And that often means clearing out the clutter that keeps us from functioning efficiently, whether we're at work or at home. Many employees -- whether they go to actual offices or do their jobs from home -- find the last week of the calendar year is ideal for sorting through e-mails, clearing their desks, and reorganizing their work spaces. Sorting through stuff is rarely fun, but those who tackle it now will find themselves a step ahead when their now-vacationing colleagues and clients come staggering back after the holidays. According to the National Association of Professional Organizers, which sponsors the annual ""Get Organized Month"" each January to help folks take control of their time, tasks and possessions, 83% of members polled say that ""paper organization"" ranks highest on their individual and corporate clients' to-do lists. For people taking time off between Christmas and New Year's, this week offers a chance to get things in order before 2013 arrives. Devoting time to both physically and mentally clearing out the ""old"" and embracing the ""new"" is about more than just getting rid of stuff. Being organized is really about being in control, says Susan Fleischman, a Chicago-based professional organizer, home stager and founder of clutterfree. ""As joyous as the holidays can be, the period between Thanksgiving and New Year's is probably one of the most stressful of the year for people,"" she says. That's why spending the week after Christmas decluttering ""really helps you recover and detox from the hustle and bustle of the holidays. ""It's very symbolic -- we're ramping up to the ultimate do-over. We all get to turn the calendar page and make a fresh start."" For those at work, says Fleischman, ""the phone stops ringing, there are fewer meetings. Real work probably comes to a screeching halt. There are far fewer reasons to keep letting getting organized fall to the bottom of the to-do list."" And these days, when employees often feel compelled to work harder and longer, being organized can be a real competitive advantage. NAPO Industry Member Director Mary Dykstra says that on average, Americans waste time amounting to between six and 12 weeks a year searching for things in their offices and homes. ""Just imagine if you could get out from under that clutter and spend that time helping your company build their business and ultimately, your career,"" says Fleischman, who was a public relations and marketing executive before launching her professional organizing business. ""Every minute counts when it comes to impressing the boss, your colleagues and clients. At work, we strive to project that we're knowledgeable, in control and experts. We're constantly accessing, sharing, reacting to information. Being able to put your hands on the information or generate some information means the better you'll be able to rise to the top and have clarity of thought and creativity and maximize productivity."" But what about moving from work to the home front? Cynthia Ewer, the Washington state-based editor of OrganizedHome.com and the author of ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Getting Organized Fast-Track,"" suggests we use this in-between-holidays week to step back and reflect on our habits and how well they're working for us at home. It's important to remember, says Ewer, that ""there are different personality types. ""Organized"" is what works for you. There are filers -- people who love folders. They want the serenity of knowing where things are. Pilers like to keep their eyes on their stuff. Deniers have bags of paperwork shoved into closets. Instead of using a ""What-does-it-look-like?"" yardstick, it's a ""How-will-it-work?"" question. Know yourself, and come up with solutions that reflect who you are, she says. After all, she says, "" 'It's here somewhere' is the most frustrating phrase in the English language."" Cutting clutter also can boost the bottom line. ""How many times do you go to the store and buy the things you couldn't find?"" asks Fleischman. But cleaning up and cleaning out also can generate money, says Ewer. ""It can be a real fun process to turn your clutter into cash."" Nab tax deductions by donating cleared-out items to nonprofit organizations. Declutterers can send usable books, DVDs, video games and music to third-party merchants in exchange for gift cards through the Amazon Trade-In Program. Even computer manufacturers like Apple offer gift cards to customers who send in an old iPhone, iPad or computer for reuse or recycling, if those devices still have monetary value. ""Leading an orderly life is about saving time, saving money, reducing stress,"" says Fleischman, who also blogs about organizing tips and clutter makeovers. ""And that's energy you can spend on leisure pursuits, which is very important to emotional well-being."" Some tips for cutting through the workplace and home clutter this holiday week: . • Stockpile your supplies. Fleischman advises making sure you've got the right trash bins, shredders, file folders and markers at your fingertips before you start sorting and tossing. • Take it a zone at a time. Your office, home and car didn't become a mess overnight, so declutter in increments. Fleischman suggests starting with desktops, then floors, then moving on to file cabinets and bookcases. • Go from horizontal to vertical piles. If you're purging papers, clear those piles from your desk and the floor by placing newly sorted files in a cabinet or an upright vertical file. This way, your eyes can quickly scan and identify what you need at a glance. • Free up the fridge. ""Get the ghosts of Christmas past out of there -- all those little cans of this and that, the beef sticks from the gift basket no one can bear to throw out,"" says Ewer. Besides, this clean-up also will save you some calories. • Be realistic. If you really write out bills at the kitchen table and not in the home office, says Ewer, get yourself a wheeled cart you can roll where the work gets done. If your kids' toys actually live in the family room -- not in the bedroom toy box -- create a storage solution there. ""Look at your patterns of living and organize yourself accordingly.""","Do your New Year's resolutions include a push to clean up? Here are some tips to start .

"(CNN) -- It is a problem of massive plastic proportions -- a giant floating debris field, composed mostly of bits and pieces of plastic, in the northwest Pacific Ocean, about a thousand miles off the coast of California. Researchers recover nets from the Pacific Ocean on August 3, 2009. It's called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and it covers a vast area of hundreds, maybe even thousands, of miles of open ocean. Now researchers are trying to learn more about the sea-bound trash zone and perhaps find answers to basic questions. A crew of scientists from the University of California's Scripps Institution of Oceanography has embarked on a three-week mission aboard the research vessel New Horizon, heading for the debris field to study it. The mission is not as straightforward as it sounds. ""There may be a misapprehension ... that if you got out there and stood on the middle of a deck you'd see nothing but plastic litter from horizon to horizon,"" said Robert Knox, deputy director for research at the Scripps Institution. ""It's relatively sparse, and you might or might not see something visible to the human eye at any particular location out there,"" Knox says. ""Certainly one does encounter pieces of plastic stuff that are big enough to see. But the other side of the puzzle is all the little bits and pieces of plastic that you can't even see unless you scoop up a sample of seawater and see what's in there."" ""I think it's a little misleading to think of it as a great big island that you could practically get out and walk on, but the point is it's a big area of ocean. So even a few pieces of plastic per square meter amounts to a lot of plastic when you add it up over this enormous ocean area."" There has been some previous research on this garbage field, but not much. It's been very poorly studied in a scientific sense. Major questions remain: . How how much stuff is there? What size is the stuff? Where is it distributed in the ocean, at the surface or at what depth? What does it do to the food chain, especially the small particles of plastic that may be ingested by smaller organisms at the bottom of the food chain? While the main focus of the Scripps mission is the impact of this plastic trash on marine life, researchers will gather information on a wide variety of issues. Here's what scientists do know: They know the size of this zone is huge, maybe as big as Texas. And they know that all the plastic accumulated in the patch has mostly broken down into smaller bits, floating just under the water's surface like confetti, basically a soupy mix of plastic-filled seawater that stretches for maybe thousands of miles. They know the garbage patch has been growing for many years, and scientists first became aware of the problem years ago when fisherman reported encountering widespread debris. They know there are other debris fields in other oceans of the world, but this one is the biggest. Rusty Brainard with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says this giant garbage patch, in addition to plastic, also contains huge masses of fishing nets, which destroys ecosystems around the Hawaiian Islands. But the plastic is really the toxic killer. While it slowly degrades, it turns into increasingly smaller bits of plastic. Seabirds mistake it for food and they dive down and eat it. Brainard says they find a lot of skeletons of seabirds on the Islands and ""their gut content is just filled with plastic."" Brainard says that has scientists wondering what other animals are eating this plastic. As the larger animals and marine life eat the smaller animals, this plastic eventually ends up in the human food supply, too. But even the size is of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is uncertain. ""It's not a hard and fast number. It's a little bit like a whirlpool on the surface of a river or a lake. You'd be hard-pressed to tell me where the edge is. All you know is that it's stronger in the middle than it is in the outer reaches. But it's an area of many hundreds of miles -- perhaps thousands -- in which the ocean currents tend to bring it together,"" according to Knox. NOAA has tracked the Great Pacific Garbage Patch movement to some degree. Scientists know it moves as much as a thousand miles north and south in the Pacific seasonally. And during warmer ocean periods, known as El Nino, it drifts even further south. A kind of large, clock-wise circulation of currents driven by the wind around the Pacific ocean basin causes the plastic and other garbage to mix together in convergence zones, forming this giant trash zone and making its movements comparable to a whirlpool. Researchers believe this enormous trash zone accumulated over many years from trash being dumped off boats and ocean-going ships, and from trash accumulated on beaches, where it eventually washed in the Pacific Ocean and into the huge zone. This study mission may even help scientists determine whether there's any way to clean up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and, if so, the best way to do it. CNN's Ninette Sosa contributed to this report.","Researchers are trying to learn the effects of the plastic and debris on wildlife .

"(CNN) -- A large group of Baltimore corrections officers and members of a notorious prison gang have been working together to peddle drugs, phones and sex inside the city's jail, prosecutors say. But an indictment released this week is another shot, prosecutors say, in putting an end to it. An indictment, announcing charges on 14 more Baltimore corrections officers, reads like script from the now defunct HBO crime drama ""The Wire."" But the U.S. Attorney's Office for Maryland says this drama involving prison gang , the Black Guerrilla Family, and a growing number of Baltimore jail guards has gone on for too long. ""Correctional officers were in bed with BGF inmates,"" said U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein. Rosenstein seemed to mean that literally and figuratively, court documents show. According to one indictment, alleged gang member Tavon White had a sexual relationship with four jail guards while he was incarcerated. He impregnated all four of them and they all helped him smuggle items in prison, according to the indictment. One of the guards had ""Tavon"" tattooed on her wrist, the indictment said. In January, White summed up his standing in the prison while talking on a cell phone that had been smuggled in, the indictment says . ""This is my jail. You understand that? I'm dead serious ... I make every final call in this jail ... and nothing go past me ... Any of my brothers that deal with anybody, it's gonna come to me. Before (somebody) stab somebody, they gotta run it through me,"" White said according to the indictment. Correctional officers were allegedly ""bribed"" to smuggle in drugs, cell phones and other prohibited objects, which they hid underneath their clothes, ""inside body cavities,"" even in sandwiches. New Orleans jail video shows drugs, guns, filth . Some inmates who weren't part of the gang had to pay protection money -- or more accurately, their relatives on the outside did -- authorities claim. ""Court documents allege the BGF members recruited correctional officers through personal and often sexual relationships, as well as bribes, and that some officers traded sex for money,"" the U.S. Attorney's office said in its news release. The end result was what Rosenstein's office called a ""criminal organization"" operating inside jails ""enabling (participants) to make large amounts of money through drug trafficking, robbery, assault, extortion, bribery, witness retaliation, money laundering and obstruction of justice."" The investigation first came to light in April with the announcement of the first round of arrests. In all, 44 people have been indicted on federal charges. Twenty seven of them are Baltimore correctional officers, CNN affiliate WJZ reported. Is in-jail night club inmate's latest perk? CNN's Dave Stewart contributed to this report.","In all, 27 Baltimore correctional officers have been charged in the scheme .

"(CNN) -- While millions may be running to the malls this holiday season, there are some people running away from the buying frenzy. Several online movements have inspired thousands of people to attempt to spend little or no cash on holiday presents. Followers are avoiding shopping malls and opting to save their money, make their own presents or provide free services like baby-sitting or massages as gifts. ""The holiday season is about sharing time with loved ones, not going into debt,"" said Cat Ellis, a Facebook ""Buy Nothing Christmas"" follower. ""It is entirely unnecessary to spend money in order to show others that you care."" In addition to the Facebook page that Ellis and some 1,700 people follow, websites called buynothingchristmas, buynothingday and revbilly are encouraging people to stop spending a lot of cash on gifts and reduce holiday consumerism. Aiden Enns co-founded buynothingchristmas.org and said during the holidays, his site attracts up to 7,000 hits a day from people wanting to learn more about the movement. ""Our website challenges people to de-commercialize Christmas and connect in simpler ways, such as spending time with friends and loved ones and giving to less-privileged people,"" said Enns. Kyle Denholm of Petoskey, Michigan, is among those who asked his family to attend a holiday event together instead of exchanging gifts last year. ""It felt wonderful to create some special memories with people we love and we plan to do it again this year,"" said Denholm. It's not just anti-consumerism fueling the cause. ""Christmas is an environmentalist's worst nightmare -- tons of extra landfill, megawatts of flashing lights and congested shopping mall parking lots,"" said Liz Wylie, an anti-consumer subscriber. While followers of the movement find various ways to support the cause, Scott Krugman, a spokesperson with the National Retail Federation, has a different take. Krugman said he respects a person's right to celebrate the holidays as he or she chooses and does not want to make it a ""we"" versus ""them"" issue. ""However, the retail sector helps generate one in five U.S. jobs and it is important to remember how critical this industry is to our weakened economy and to help support it,"" Krugman said. ""Some 95% of retailers are small, independent businesses."" ""Some 500,000 retail positions will be created this holiday season in the U.S. and these jobs play a huge role in fueling our economy."" But for some people, like Ellis, supporting the U.S. retail sector is not an easy option. Her family was forced to change spending habits a couple of years ago. ""After my husband lost his job in January of 2008 he was unemployed for almost two years before he found part-time work,"" said Ellis. ""I had my own business, which became our primary income. Unemployment benefits didn't cover much -- we didn't have a choice but to be hyper-responsible with money."" The anti-consumerism philosophy has kept the Ellises afloat financially. Ellis said they don't have to worry about credit card bills and she does not argue with her husband about money. ""I know some people are willing to run up the charge cards and spend tons of cash on the latest toys and games for children,"" Ellis said. ""I can get 'new-to-my-kids' toys and give an even more important gift -- a family that is financially stable even in a failing economy."" Ellis said making gifts for the holidays and finding free or used items is easier than many might imagine. ""Look at your talents and ask yourself -- can you cook or sew or do you have a special hobby to share? Is there something you can teach or could you clean someone's house?"" As a former massage therapist, she has used her skills to give free gift certificates. She also knits and gives away food she has grown, canned and baked. Ellis' husband, Eddie, is a beekeeper and gives away honey, beeswax candles or honey wine (also known as mead). ""I've found people are far more impressed with the time and effort that went into a handmade gift than the perceived dollar amount spent on a retail gift.""","Anti-consumerism movements have inspired people to avoid buying holiday gifts .

"(CNN) -- ""Wherever the olive tree grows, you won't find much tax being collected,"" the mayor of a small town in southern Spain told me a few years ago. He shrugged; such was life. He probably had no idea that some high-powered academics were about to come up with the same conclusion. When they analyzed Europe's ""shadow economies"" -- defined as areas that fall beyond the reach of the taxman -- those of Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal were much larger (relatively) than those in northern Europe. That is partly because of the higher number of self-employed and family businesses, which tend to deal in cash and pay little tax. But to many economic commentators, tax evasion is also a national pastime in much of southern Europe, and a significant factor in the region's burgeoning financial crisis. According to a 2007 paper by Austrian economist Friedrich Schneider, the shadow economy in Italy accounted for 22.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), that of Spain 19.3%; Portugal 19.2% and Greece a staggering 25.1%. By comparison, the U.S. shadow economy was 7.2% of GDP. A recent European Union report came up with similar figures. Silvio Berlusconi mused several years ago that high tax rates in Italy made evasion a ""natural right"" for many. And the evidence does suggest that wherever tax rates and social security contributions are high, the shadow economy is larger. The U.S. ambassador in Rome noted in a 2009 diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks that Italy was ""addicted both to profligate social welfare spending and to tax evasion."" And this year, Industry Minister Paolo Romani estimated ""phantom"" or undeclared income in Italy at a monstrous $320 billion. The Italian state -- whose debt has measured more than 100% of GDP every year since 1992 -- is perennially poor, in a country of individual wealth that's well hidden from the authorities. Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti recently told a conference that fewer than 800 people in Italy -- which is the world's seventh-richest country -- had declared incomes of more than 1 million euros ($1.4 million) in 2010. That means the salaried middle class end up paying more. Tremonti is aiming to more than double the amount recovered from tax evasion within the next two years. A recently unveiled series of television commercials attacks the ""parassita della societa"" -- the parasites evading taxes, comparing them with malarial mosquitoes. Even so, the European Commission is not optimistic that Italy's ""heavy reliance"" on tackling tax evasion will be enough to balance the budget within two years. Greek PM optimistic about referendum . Until 2006, national and local taxes in Italy were collected by banks and other private institutions. It was only five years ago that a single agency -- Equitalia --was created to modernize tax collection. Not that Italians have taken the agency to their hearts, with effigies of Equitalia sometimes hanged at public protests. The Italian media and activist groups say the agency has gone after the lower middle-class taxpayers for small tax debts, often forcing people into foreclosure, while tax evasion among the wealthy remains rampant. Taxation in Italy also is a cumbersome business. For example, there are six different levels of taxation on diesel fuel -- from fishing boats to taxis and ambulances. And there are multiple agencies involved in tax assessment that are not famous for cooperating. But the price of not improving the government's tax take may be high. Until now Italy has been able to service its debt with relative comfort, but higher interest rates on its bonds may imperil that. The yield on Italian debt now exceeds 6%. Greece is renowned for its history of tax evasion, estimated last year as worth 4% of GDP -- $11 billion. It may be much more: the Federation of Greek Industries has estimated that the government may be losing as much as $30 billion a year to tax evasion. A report by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development on Greece last year concluded that ""to fight widespread tax evasion, a sustained and major effort to strengthen tax administration is necessary. Particular emphasis should be placed on enforcement to ensure that those in the informal economy are brought into the tax net."" That apparently includes some prominent doctors in an up-market part of Athens, who declared incomes of less that $45,000 but had kids at private schools, and owned swimming pools, yachts and other visible signs of wealth. Their names were published last year as part of a populist campaign by Prime Minister George Papandreou to get tough with tax evaders. More embarrassment came when Professor Herakles Polemarchakis -- former head of the prime minister's economic department -- found that the farming town of Larisa in Greece had more Porsche Cayenne SUVs per capita than any other city in the world. In an article, Polemarchakis noted: ""The proliferation of Cayennes is a curiosity, given that farming is not a flourishing sector in Greece"" and that declared incomes in Larisa were very modest. Greece has revived an ""Economic Crimes Enforcement Agency"" and tried to improve tax collection as part of a multi-pronged initiative to cut the budget deficit. But collecting more taxes in the teeth of a savage recession is not easy. The opposition New Democracy party has argued for lower tax rates combined with more effective action in tackling tax evasion. The influential London Business School says in a recent paper that the Greek tax system is hopelessly broken. ""Tax and customs and excise evasion must be addressed head-on,"" it says, while noting that former senior officials at the Ministry of Finance had forecast ""astonishingly, that even if all the tax-collecting authorities were shut down, state revenues would not suffer noticeably."" The London Business School report says many officials had simply refused to carry out audits demanded by the Finance Ministry and concluded that the current tax authorities were ""beyond salvation."" Spain has done more than most to tackle tax evasion, according to analysts, taking more tax cheats to court and gathering more data from bills and credit card records to pursue tax evaders. Authorities have tracked down an estimated 200,000 individuals who had not declared income from rental properties, previously a massive source of tax evasion. Five years ago the Spanish Ministry of Finance also launched an investigation to find out why a quarter of all high-denomination 500-euro notes circulating in Europe were in Spain. The answer -- they were handy for organized crime and as a way of evading taxes in Spain's booming (but now busted) construction industry. Spaniards began calling the 500-euro note the 'bin Laden' -- everyone knew what it stood for and what it looked like, but no one ever saw it. (Italian investigators have warned that the bank note was becoming popular with the mafia and adding to the problem of tax evasion.) The Spanish government reaped more than $13 billion last year by clamping down on evasion -- 23% more than in 2009. Spain's tax authorities have established special units to monitor the ""offshoring"" of revenues by companies and fraud in the real estate market. But groups like the Corporate Social Responsibility Observatory say 80% of Spain's largest firms continue to harbor profits in tax havens. Better tax collection is not going to solve the myriad of economic problems confronting the Mediterranean countries, where extravagant state spending, inflexible labor markets, distorted competition policy and inefficient state enterprises have all contributed to the current crisis. But at a time when investors and lenders want to see ""fiscal rectitude,"" going after tax evaders is one of the easier ways of demonstrating intent.","""Shadow economies"" are defined as areas that fall beyond the reach of the taxman .

"(CNN) -- As he rolls across the wheat fields of his Nebraska farm, Steve Tucker often has his hands not on the wheel of his tractor, but on a smartphone. Steve Tucker, a Twittering farmer, pauses in front of his tractor in Nebraska. He sometimes posts a dozen messages per day on Twitter, commenting on everything from the weather to the state of his crops to his son's first tractor ride and even last night's cheeseburger. ""Got rained out trying to finish up planting corn. Only 90 acres left. Maybe it will dry up today and I can finish Lord willin',"" he wrote in one recent post. ""Just sold some more wheat, now, I wait for God to provide the harvest so I can fill the contracts,"" the 39-year-old said in another. ""Eat more bread!"" Tucker is proof that smartphones are starting to put down roots in rural America. He lives in a 150-person town near Brandon, Nebraska -- a place even he calls ""the middle of nowhere."" The nearest neighbor to his 4,000-acre farm is about 2 miles away. Yet, farmers like Tucker are using Internet-enabled phones to gain a foothold on online social networks -- both for business and personal reasons. (Follow him on Twitter) ""I can be in the most remote place and just with the power of having a BlackBerry ... I can communicate with anybody at anytime about anything,"" he said. ""It is just amazing."" The growth of smartphones on farms is important because many people don't think about where their food comes from, much less associate a specific farmer with that process, said Andy Kleinschmidt, a farmer and agricultural extension educator at Ohio State University. ""When you can put a name or personality with someone who's actually raising corn and soybeans or actually milking cows, that's the most important thing that's come about in my opinion,"" he said. A host of blogs and Twitter feeds have popped up around the subjects of technology and life on the farm. On Tuesdays from 8 to 10 p.m. ET, farmers meet on Twitter for a live chat about all things agricultural. You can watch that conversation by searching for agchat on the site. Kleinschmidt said he uses a smartphone to check live weather reports, which can make or break a year's crop. Other farmers send him pictures of ailing plants, hoping to identify crop diseases early. Some farmers use their phones as notepads, tracking their applications of pesticides, he said. Developers of phone applications apparently have taken notice of the farm-tech trend, too. An iPhone application called PureSense helps techie farmers in drought-stricken places monitor how much water is in their soil at various locations and in real time. Historically, farms have lagged behind the rest of country in Internet and computer usage. But a 2007 census by the U.S. Department of Agriculture says Web use on farms is increasing. High-speed Internet access doubled on U.S. farms between 2005 and 2007, for instance, jumping from 13 percent to 27 percent. That's still less than the general population, however. Fifty-five percent of farms had Internet access in 2007 compared with 62 percent of homes in the United States overall, according to government statistics. The census does not measure smartphone penetration. Internet-enabled phones are making their way into rural America slowly because it's difficult to send Internet data over cellular networks in some sparsely populated areas where wireless service is spotty, some advocates have claimed. Still, some farmers are adopting the technology despite the odds. The biggest draw of smartphones and online social networks is that they provide human connections to people for whom farm life can be lonely, said Chuck Zimmerman, publisher of an agriculture news blog called agwired.com. ""Most farmers are going to be in their [tractor] cab,"" he said. ""You're going all day long, night and day -- it can get a little bit boring, you know? So, a lot of them have satellite radio, smartphones, iPhones, BlackBerries. I can't tell you how many farmers are following me who are tweeting form the cab."" It's a misconception that farmers are behind the curve technologically, Zimmerman said. ""In large part, farmers tend to be very early adopters of technology. We have the stereotypical image of a hayseed farmer that still persists -- out on a tractor with a straw hat on,"" he said. ""The reality is that most of them are very highly trained from a technological standpoint."" Tucker said his job on the farm in Nebraska includes more than harvesting wheat, corn, sunflowers and millet. He wants to bring urban Internet users along for the ride. And in doing so, he's become a sort of text-happy evangelist for rural America. ""People out in the cities aren't familiar with agriculture like it used to be 100 years ago. They may not have an appreciation or an understanding of what goes on out in the rural side of things,"" he said. ""I just try to be an information source for whoever may be listening."" So that's what he does from his tractor -- one tweet at a time.","Smartphones and online social networks are gaining popularity on farms .

"(CNN) -- Privacy advocates are up in arms. They say the Obama administration is seeking to increase the government's surveillance powers. The White House is out to require internet companies to keep trapdoors so the government can read any and all messages. Kevin Bankston of the Electronic Frontier Foundation called the proposal ""a drastic anti-privacy, anti-security, anti-innovation solution in search of a problem."" These privacy advocates remind me of someone who locks his front door only to return home and find that thieves have emptied his home through the back door and the windows he left wide open. These days, the main enemy of privacy is not Big Brother, but a whole bunch of Little Brothers: profit-making corporations. Two kinds of corporations keep track of what you buy, read, visit, drink; whom you call, e-mail, and date; and lots more. Some merely track your activity on their site as part of their regular business, to help them sell you stuff. This is true from Amazon to Zappos. Other corporations make shadowing you -- and keeping very detailed dossiers on you -- their main line of business. They sell this information to all comers. Just one such company, Choicepoint, has records on more than 220 million people. Most Americans probably know corporations are tracking them, but they may well be unaware of the latest ways corporations are carving up whatever remains of their privacy. Cell phone companies offer a service that allows lovers, ex-wives and ex-husbands, lawyers, or anyone else to find out where you are hanging out. We are accustomed to tracking tools like cookies, which are installed on your computer by websites you visit. Cookies are used to identify you and to remember your preferences. They make shopping easier, but they also give sites the power to spy on you. We have learned about devices that allow us to clear cookies from our computer, but corporations are installing ""supercookies"" that are very difficult to detect, and if removed, can secretly reinstall themselves. You might think you can hide behind pseudonyms and use multiple cyber-mailboxes so trackers will be unable to profile you. However, some companies have developed software to match pseudonyms used on message boards and blogs with real names and personal e-mail addresses. The subjects of this tracking -- who are unaware that their anonymity has been stripped -- include people who use online pseudonyms to discuss sensitive topics, such as mental illness or medical conditions. Beyond tracking and surveillance, select corporations keep dossiers on any crimes you have committed, any divorces, political leanings, the gender and age of any children in the household, as well as interests in topics including religion, the Bible, gambling and adult entertainment. Privacy advocates have sharply objected to proposals for the government to employ ""deep packet inspection,"" a powerful tool used to analyze the contents of data sent on the internet, to fight viruses and cybercrime. But now, private companies offer this service for a fee. If you think that what the private sector knows about you stays in the private sector, I have a bridge in Brooklyn I'd like to sell you. In what must be the ultimate irony, the corporations not only do almost everything the federal government has been banned from doing since the 1974 Privacy Act -- as well as Congress' 2003 termination of Total Information Awareness, a Pentagon surveillance program -- but they also make the stuff available to the government. For instance, Choicepoint has 35 contracts with government agencies, including the Department of Justice, and through it, the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, IRS and the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services. Your options are limited and not very appealing, to put it mildly. Some say, ""Get over it; privacy is dead."" Or ""assume nothing is private anymore."" You might  try to return to the olden days: Pay only with cash, smash your PC and GPS and cell phone, and wear a burqa. Or you may move to Europe, which has much stronger privacy protection laws than the U.S. but, as far as I can tell, often does not enforce them. Or: Take a deep breath and realize that the only one who can protect you is the Big Bad Wolf -- the federal government. It is the one that, since 2000, has banned the selling of medical records, previously used by mortgage companies to call in loans of those who got cancer, or by employers in their hiring decisions. It is the government that required banks to keep your financial records private. And it is the government that is working to create new internet privacy laws and methods and a new office to enforce them. For example, the Federal Trade Commission has recommended a ""do not track"" mechanism that would allow computer users to opt out of surveillance by companies. I grant you that long experience teaches us that the government itself must be watched. However, if you think that it is the main threat to your privacy these days, I humbly suggest that you think again. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Amitai Etzioni.","Amitai Etzioni: Online privacy advocates fear government, but businesses are the real threat .

"(CNN) -- A third person -- identified only as a girl -- has died from injuries sustained in last week's crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 214, officials at the San Francisco hospital where she was being treated said Friday. San Francisco General spokeswoman Rachael Kagan said the ""minor girl"" had been in critical condition at the Bay Area hospital since last Saturday's incident. The hospital didn't release any information about the girl -- including her name, age or ethnicity -- who died Friday morning, according to Dr. Margaret Knudson, the hospital's chief of surgery. ""It's a very, very sad day today at San Francisco General Hospital,"" said Dr. Geoffrey Manley, chief of neurosurgery. ""We have all done everything we could."" Two other people -- both 16-year-old girls from China -- were reported dead soon after the Boeing 777 crash-landed at San Francisco International Airport. One of those teenagers was hit on the runway by a fire truck, though it's not clear whether she was already dead when she was struck, San Francisco police spokesman Albie Esparza told CNN on Friday. At the time, firefighters were using flame retardant that ended up surrounding areas immediately around the plane with foam, Esparza said. ""When the truck repositioned itself to get a better aim of the fuselage, they discovered the body of the victim in the fresh track from the path of the truck,"" he added. The foam was thick enough to cover a body, Esparza noted. Moreover, it is difficult for those in the ""industrial-size"" fire trucks that responded to crash to see things on the ground, the police spokesman said. ""Right now, we are waiting results from the coroner to determine if she died from the crash or the fire engine going over her,"" the police spokesman said. ""And that will be part of our investigations, like any other case, by our hit-and-run and major accidents investigations teams."" Of the passengers and crew on board, 304 people survived -- 123 of whom walked away relatively unscathed and the remainder sent to hospitals. A handful of them remained hospitalized, including six patients at San Francisco General as of 3 p.m. (6 p.m. ET) Friday. That hospital's figure include two adults in critical condition with spinal cord injuries, abdominal injuries, internal bleeding, road rash and fractures. Besides the passengers and crew members' physical recovery, San Francisco International Airport is working to get back to normal as well. The airport was shut down to incoming and departing traffic for several hours after the Asiana crash, which occurred around 11:30 a.m. Saturday. Two of its four runways reopened later that day, though the charred remnants of the downed 777 remained -- a visible reminder of the horror that had unfolded. Early Friday morning, that airline's fuselage was hauled away on flatbed trucks to a remote section of the airport, said San Francisco International Airport in a press release. By 5:05 p.m., a Southwest Airlines jet landed on the runway where the crash occurred -- signifying that, for the first time in six days, all four of the airport's runways were operational. ""The tremendous efforts and around-the-clock work of airport staff, government agencies, airline tenants and contractors allowed us to complete all repairs and safety certifications for Runway 28L in a timely and efficient manner,"" said airport director John L. Martin. While the wreckage has been hauled away, investigators still have not pinpointed exactly why Flight 214 crashed, or who was to blame. An in-depth review of the cockpit voice recorder shows two pilots called for the landing to be aborted before the plane hit a seawall and crashed onto the runway, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday. The first internal call by one of the three pilots in the cockpit to abort the landing came three seconds before the crash and a second was made by another pilot 1.5 seconds before impact, NTSB chief Deborah Hersman said. The agency has begun wrapping up its investigation at the airport and crews are cleaning up the debris left by the crash. Investigators turned the runway back over to the airport. The runway has been closed since Saturday's crash. The investigation is shifting back to NTSB headquarters in Washington, where authorities will work to find a more definitive answer about what led to the crash. The passenger jet's main landing gear slammed into the seawall between the airport and San Francisco Bay, spinning the aircraft 360 degrees as it broke into pieces and eventually caught fire. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Augie Martin and Ed Payne contributed to this report.","NEW: All four runways at San Francisco's airport are now operational, airport says .

"(CNN) -- He was just 18 years old when he got the news. It was the summer before his senior year in high school. ""I had a fever of 103,"" Bryan Seth Johnson said. ""My body was hurting; I wasn't eating, couldn't hold down food. I just felt weak all the time."" He went to the hospital, told them he was having difficulty swallowing and was treated for tonsillitis. But he didn't have tonsillitis. Johnson had the human immunodeficiency virus, better known as HIV. ""I was basically in shock, because the guy I got HIV from works in the HIV-prevention field,"" Johnson recalled. ""He deleted me from Facebook and basically cut all communication out."" At the time, Johnson was getting tested for sexually transmitted diseases every three months at SMYAL, an organization dedicated to supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and questioning youth in Washington. Johnson says he generally practiced safe sex, but once, when he was under the influence, he had unprotected sex. Still, ""I was in denial at the time. I thought it might be a false test."" So he got retested. He remembers the date: September 16. The result was the same. ""The bus ride home was so quiet. Even though there was a whole bunch of noise around me, I blocked everything out."" At home, he could not tell his mother; her baby brother had died of AIDS complications two years before Johnson was born. One in a million . At the 20th International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, Australia, this week, young people from over 50 countries gathered to make sure the issues of their generation were heard. The numbers are quite startling. Globally, 5 million young people between the ages of 15 and 24 are living with HIV. They represent 41% of all new infections. About 2,500 young people become infected every day, according to Advocates for Youth, an organization that works here and in developing countries. In the United States, 26% of all new HIV infections are among young people ages 13 to 24, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most new infections are among young gay and bisexual males. Yet only one in five high school students who has had sex has been tested for HIV, according to a new CDC report (PDF) on sexual risk behaviors. Although the majority of sexually active teens report using condoms, those numbers are decreasing, said Dr. Stephanie Zaza, director of the CDC's Division of Adolescent and School Health. ""Teens are unaware of their risk of HIV and how to protect themselves,"" Zaza said. ""As parents and health professionals, and as educators, we need to take responsibility to help them learn about HIV."" 'We know what works' A staggering 60% of youths with HIV in the United States don't know that they are infected, which leads us to an even more troubling statistic: In 2011, about 3,000 young people in this country were diagnosed with AIDS, an increase of 29% since 2008. ""That makes me sick to my stomach,"" said Adam Tanner, executive director of Metro TeenAIDS in Washington. ""I'm horrified. I think we're in a moment now where there is more complacency around HIV."" Metro TeenAIDS is a community health organization working with young people to end HIV/AIDS. It's where Johnson went to be retested, and after his diagnosis, he began volunteering with the group. Tanner says two-thirds of Metro TeenAIDS' clients who come in for testing have had unprotected sex in the past year. Two years ago, a Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 64% of 15- to 24-year-olds in the United States don't get tested because they think they're not at risk. More than 40% said they didn't get tested because their doctors never suggested it. ""We know what works to end the epidemic,"" Tanner said. ""We have better medications than we've ever had before. We need to arm young people with basic education about how HIV is transmitted. ... All the data suggest that by fourth grade, we should be starting those conversations about sex."" The United States is one of 10 countries that make up 61% of HIV cases, says Cornelius Baker, acting director of the HIV/AIDS division at the nonprofit group FHI 360. ""We have the tools to protect our young people through education, quality health care and family and community support,"" Baker said. ""If we continue to fail them, our hopes of an AIDS-free generation will be lost."" Safe sex or no sex . Brennan Stewart, 22, understands the importance of educating young people. He was diagnosed with HIV at age 16. Stewart had just had a routine physical and blood work done. His mother delivered the news. ""My first thought was death. I was going to die,"" Stewart recalled. ""I felt like, oh, my God, I'm just this dirty person. ... I've contracted something that's going to mess up my life."" He's not sure how he got it. He says he practiced safe sex but not all the time. He never got sick, never had any symptoms of the disease. A few months after the diagnosis, he started taking medication. Today, he takes one pill a day and has no side effects. He says his viral load is undetectable. Metro TeenAIDS has kept him on track, making sure he does what he needs to do to stay healthy. He wants other teens to know what he learned the ""extremely"" hard way. ""If you think it can't happen to you, it can,"" he said emphatically. ""You have to get tested, because if you don't, you can put your life in danger, as well as somebody else's life."" Oh, ""and wrap it up,"" he said. ""Either safe sex or no sex.""

"(CNN) -- A bomb blast Monday killed eight people and injured at least 12 others at a medical school in Kano, Nigeria, the city's police commissioner said. The explosive devices went off around 2 p.m. local time in a parking lot at the School of Hygiene, said Adelere Shinaba, police commissioner of Kano, Nigeria's second-largest city. A suspect is in custody after being arrested on the scene, police said, and the suspect's car was discovered outside the school. Police said they don't have a motive for the blast and are still investigating, but Boko Haram terrorists have targeted the northern Nigerian city in the past. The militant group says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Police swept the area around the school Monday with detection devices to make sure there were no additional bombs. Eyewitnesses reported heavy military and police presence around the school. CNN's Susanna Capelouto wrote and reported from Atlanta, and journalist Aminu Abubakar reported from Nigeria.","A bomb goes off in the parking lot of a medical school in Kano, Nigeria, police say .

"(CNN) -- Juan Salgado was 16 when he started cutting sugarcane, in a town near the Pacific coast of Nicaragua in 1966. His symptoms began about 35 years later: Fever. Headaches. Poor appetite. Feelings of faintness. For no obvious reason, his kidneys were severely damaged, to the point that doctors said he couldn't do agricultural work anymore. Many of his friends had it worse. ""I know, many, many workers who were colleagues of mine, who have already died, and I know also many who are not capable of working anymore because of the disease,"" said Salgado, now 65, who worked near the town of Chichigalpa, Nicaragua. The disease is known by scientists as ""chronic kidney disease of unknown origin,"" or CKDu. In rural communities in Nicaragua, it's ""creatinina,"" the Spanish word for creatinine, a biomarker of kidney strength. At least 20,000 people have died prematurely from this mysterious disease in Central America in the last two decades, according to one estimate, but the real scope of the problem is unknown. The illness is not related to diabetes or hypertension -- drivers of kidney disease in the United States -- and affects primarily young men. The disease is concentrated on the Pacific Coast in male agricultural workers, especially those cutting sugarcane. El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica seem to be hotbeds of the illness. Scientists believe that a multitude of factors could be contributing to the disease, but that there's likely at least one factor that is job-related. Making matters tricky, the sugarcane industry has been a provider of funding for major studies on the illness, raising concerns that companies could be influencing the results. In Salgado's opinion, the Nicaraguan sugarcane industry players ""know well the cause of this disease."" Jason Glaser, a documentary filmmaker and community advocate, is not as sure. It is not yet clear to scientists and industry leaders what is causing this increased incidence of kidney disease. La Isla Foundation, which Salgado co-founded with Glaser in 2008, is dedicated to improving the well-being of sugarcane workers with the disease and promoting prevention, and is collaborating with researchers to better understand what's causing this enigmatic illness. The organization is convening a meeting in July with CDC representatives, and researchers from various institutions to explore possibilities for more research. ""This is a complex problem,"" said Dr. Reina Turcios-Ruiz, resident adviser at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Central America Regional Office in Guatemala. ""It's going to take some time to find an answer, but I think it's important that we stick to it."" ""None of the scientific investigations that have been made have established a link of causality between the sugar activity in Central America, and therefore our company, and CKD,"" Ariel Granera Sacasa, spokesperson for Nicaragua Sugar Estates Limited, said in an e-mail. Nicaragua Sugar Estates Limited is the company that owns Ingenio San Antonio, where Salgado worked for decades. What is CKDu? In the United States, a typical patient dies of chronic kidney disease their 70s or 80s, said Daniel Brooks of Boston University School of Public Health. But in Central America, men often get it in their 20s or 30s, and die by their 40s or 50s. There are no early-stage signs. When patients experience symptoms such as fatigue, pain and high blood pressure, ""a lot of the kidney function is already gone,"" said Brooks, who has been studying the illness. ""In order to be able to help people, they (screenings) need to be done on people who are asymptomatic,"" he said. Stage 3 is considered chronic kidney disease, Brooks said. Stage 5 is ""end-stage"" -- where the only way to stay alive is to be on dialysis or get a transplant. Different people progress at different speeds. Kidney dialysis and transplant -- both expensive undertakings -- are not accessible to many people in Salgado's region of Nicaragua. ""The people who are mainly affected are poor workers, typically in agricultural situations,"" Brooks said. ""There's really not much availability of the treatment options. ""Most people just live 'til they die."" Out in the fields . Why Pacific regions of Central America are especially affected is a mystery. So is the specific connection to sugarcane cutting. ""Some studies have indicated that greater than 20% of men may have it in the areas where people are employed in sugarcane,"" Brooks said, although there are also high rates of the disease reported in miners and stevedores. To some familiar with the disease, it seems clear that something about sugarcane working conditions is relevant. ""This epidemic is an occupational disease with possibly one or more yet unknown environmental components interacting with occupational dehydration,"" said Catharina Wesseling, researcher at the Universidad Nacional in Heredia, Costa Rica, and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, who has studied the disease. ""The unknown factor(s) may be a pesticide, arsenic, an infectious agent, use of nephrotoxic drugs, or other environmental pollutants. But there is no room for much doubt that chronic dehydration is one major factor."" Wesseling was co-author on a 2012 study measuring markers of kidney function, including creatinine, in 256 men and 408 women in five communities in El Salvador. They found a correlation between markers of decreased kidney function and people who performed labor on lowland sugarcane and cotton plantations. Men had a higher prevalence, but women may still be at risk, the study authors said. In a hot climate, performing physically intense labor, agricultural workers are probably facing dehydration, Turcios-Ruiz said. What's more, it's common for the workers to drink sugary soft drinks as they toil, which some mice studies suggest could be an exacerbating factor in kidney failure. ""Acute dehydration has been linked to acute kidney injury. But there has not been evidence that repeated dehydration is related to chronic kidney injury,"" Turcios-Ruiz said. There could be a genetic explanation, researchers said. It's possible that genetics could interact with environmental risk factors, such as those encountered in agricultural work, Wesseling said. One of Brooks' next studies will look at genetic susceptibility or predispositions that could affect the likelihood of developing CKDu. Another study will test children and adolescents for kidney damage before adulthood. Funding controversies . It is troubling that the sugarcane industry is financing research into the causes of CKDu, Wesseling said, because companies have been very resistant to the idea that working conditions could be related. So far, Wesseling's research has not incorporated industry funding. She has partnered with La Isla Foundation to study the disease further. She and colleagues are looking to do a study that will test different hydration and rest-time protocols. You can't do an intervention without the cooperation of the sugarcane companies, she said. ""But you need independent sources to be able to keep your independence."" Upcoming research by Brooks and colleagues will be partially funded by the sugarcane industry, with the money channeled through the CDC Foundation, a nonprofit established by Congress to connect the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to other groups and individuals, Brooks said. ""The donors have no involvement in the research beyond providing funding. The CDC Foundation is administering the grants,"" according to the CDC Foundation. There are conflict of interest policies to maintain independence from the funding source, Brooks said. Also, an external advisory board will be established to review the studies. ""CDC is providing technical assistance to Boston University on investigations into chronic kidney disease. Some of these investigations are funded through the CDC Foundation, others are not,"" Turcios-Ruiz said. Brooks' previous studies also received industry funding -- specifically, from Nicaragua Sugar Estates Limited and a professional group to which it belongs, the Comite Nacional de Productores de Azucar. La Isla Foundation would like to work with sugarcane companies on improving working conditions, provided they acknowledge that working conditions could be contributing to the illness, ""and need improvement independent of that,"" Glaser said. What can be done? The rise of CKDu in Central America, on top of conventional cases of kidney disease, is ""overwhelming local health care systems to the point of collapse,"" Wesseling and colleagues wrote in 2013 in the American Journal of Public Health. The disease is incredibly expensive, and will break the bank of any ministry of health, said Turcios-Ruiz. Nicaragua Sugar Estates Ltd. has followed recommendations from Boston University to update its protocols on hydration, rest and shade, Granera Sacasa said, and health and security personnel on the fields has doubled to implement these policies. The company is developing a program that ""includes adequate hydration, balanced diet and pauses in the work process to avoid overexertion and fatigue."" Some sugarcane companies have even started screening employees for the kidney disease biomarker before they start work, Brooks said. La Isla Foundation is working on evaluating treatment programs and helping improve the quality of health care for people with the disease. Nicaragua's health system is ""overwhelmed and underfunded,"" said Dorien Faber, public health project coordinator for La Isla Foundation. In El Salvador, Faber and Glaser are looking at how adequate care can be delivered to patients with low resources. ""There are two to three funerals a day when people drop off during the dry season,"" said Glaser. ""It's just a burden for the people. We want to do something that has nothing to do with politics."" Nowhere else to work . Salgado is lucky compared to many with CKDu. He has never been on dialysis or needed a kidney transplant. He still has occasional fluctuations in blood pressure, but a low-fat diet and less physical exertion away from the sugarcane fields, have prevented severe kidney failure, according to his colleagues. Salgado said he receives social security of about $150 a month because he had been working for so long, but did not receive any compensation from his company, he said. Three of his sons -- ages 26, 29, 33 -- work in sugarcane. Two operate machines, one is a cutter. His daughter's husband, who is like a son to him, works in irrigation. ""There is nowhere else to work,"" he said. ""The whole agricultural area is sugarcane."" With few jobs in the area, Salgado's sons have little choice, but he fears for their health. ""I'm afraid because I've seen so many young people who are already in advanced stages,"" he said. ""I know many young people of almost the age of my children, who have already left Ingenio San Antonio and can no longer work, and who have an advanced illness, and who are truly already candidates for dying.""","CKDu is a complex health problem with unknown origins .

"Tehran (CNN) -- A passenger plane crashed in Tehran on Sunday, killing at least 39 people on board, official news agencies in Iran reported. The Antonov-140 propeller plane went down shortly after leaving the runway at Mehrabad International Airport after an engine failed, the FARS semiofficial news agency reported. Sepahan Airlines Flight 5915 was carrying 40 passengers and a crew of eight when it went down, according to official news reports. Though the Islamic Republic News Agency and Tehran Times initially said that all crew and passengers were killed, Press TV reported 37 people died in the crash, two more died at a Tehran hospital and nine others were in critical condition with serious burns. IRNA later said that 40 people had been killed. ""Both black boxes of Iran-140 airplane of Hesa Co. (Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industrial Company) were found in search operations,"" Ahmad Majidi, Iran's deputy minister of roads and urban development, told the Iranian Students' News Agency, according to Press TV. The crash also injured people on the ground, including employees at a glass factory, FARS said. Some of the injured suffered severe burns, Tasnimnews reported. A witness told FARS that the tail of the plane fell from the sky first, and the front of the plane crashed farther away. Rescue workers were still working Sunday afternoon to remove bodies from the wreckage, Tasnimnews said. CNN's Eliott C.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama visited a local bookstore in Washington Saturday and offered a quick assessment of a new book out about his time in the White House. ""The Stranger: Barack Obama in the White House"" is a book from NBC host and former White House correspondent Chuck Todd. It was sitting behind the register at Politics & Prose -- a bookstore in a Washington neighborhood north of the White House. His visit coincided with the White House effort to promote shopping locally on ""Small Business Saturday."" The President visited the store on the same day last year. Shoppers at the store crowded around as Obama and his two daughters, Malia and Sasha, bought a basketful of books. But it was Todd's book that caught the President's eye, especially the cover -- a pensive profile shot of Obama. ""Lets see what Chuck has to say,"" said Obama as he leaned closer to the book, guessing from the title and cover that the book was about the President being ""sad."" ""Looks like a sad book,"" Malia said, joking with her father. It was a friendly crowd but one shopper did yell out, ""I hope you can close Guantanamo."" The President had a quick response that brought laughter from the crowd, ""We're working on it ... any other issues?"" The Obamas bought a variety of books, and the President told the cashier that some of them were Christmas presents. The White House provided a list of the President's purchases to the press, but Chuck Todd's book was not on it. Some highlights from the list include books geared towards kids including ""I Spy,"" ""Junie B. Jones and a Little Monkey Business,"" by Barbara Park, ""Brown Girl Dreaming,"" by Jacqueline Woodson and the Redwall series by Brian Jacques. There also were books for adult readers including Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness,"" ""Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End"" by Atul Gawande, and ""Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth and Faith in the New China"" by Evan Osnos.","""Looks like a sad book,"" Malia Obama jokes to her father as they shop for gifts .

"(CNN) -- Alligators can dance. They and their relatives -- crocodiles, caimans and gharials -- can also sing, much like birds do, although most of them sound more like diesel engines or chainsaws being started. Some crocodilians, the order that includes all of these animals, can even put small sticks on their snouts to lure egrets looking for nest building material. In the eight years I've been studying crocodilians, my research has taken me to 26 countries on five continents. I enjoy both the animals and the travel, studying the difficult-to-observe aspects of the life of well-known creatures and exploring the remotest corners of the world in search of more enigmatic species. Crocs hunt with sticks, Dinets and other researchers say . Here are a few of the best spots to see rare animals in the wild. Some are very easy to visit, while others would require a certain adjustment if you have Western standards of safety, personal comfort and hygiene. Everglades National Park, Florida . Have you ever seen an alligator dance? Millions of people visit this national park to see alligators and crocodiles, but some secrets of these animals weren't known until just recently. In my first week of research for my PhD in 2005, I discovered ""alligator dances,"" nighttime courtship gatherings of up to a hundred gators. I call them ""dances"" because they remind me of village dance parties, where people come alone or with their partners to communicate, flirt, shake their booties, show off, pair up and sometimes fight. Where to go: These dances can be often seen late at night in late April. Just walk to the end of the park's Anhinga Trail boardwalk with a flashlight. 10 places that can change your child's life . Monterey Bay Peninsula, California . The Monterey Bay area, which includes the city of Monterey and other small towns on California's Central Coast, is the best place to see marine mammals outside the Antarctic. You can see elephant seals, harbor seals, sea lions, whales, dolphins, porpoises, sea otters and more -- over 20 species of marine mammals if you are lucky. The ocean is calm in August and September, and huge herds of whales move in to feast on krill. Where to go: In the city of Monterey, you can walk to the ocean to look at sea otters, harbor seals and sea lions. You can also take a whale watching tour to look at gray whales (in winter and spring), blue whales and humpbacks (in summer and fall), and with some luck, killer whales, dolphins, porpoises and whatever else comes by. Go to AÃ±o Nuevo State Park to see elephant seals and Point Lobos State Park for more seals and sea otters. Eastern Quebec, Canada . This is a stunning part of the continent, where I've dived with giant Greenland sharks, petted a seal pup, paddled around a colossal meteor crater and watched a huge gannet colony at arm's length. July and August are good for diving and birding, November is good for aurora spotting, and seal pups appear in March. Where to go: The best places to visit are Ile Bonaventure, with the largest gannet colony in North America and good summer seal- and whale-watching; Iles de la Madeleine, where you can take a helicopter tour to see harp and hooded seal pups in March; Baie Comeau for diving, and the road to Goose Bay for Arctic scenery, wildlife and the Manicouagan Crater. Ranch Karanambu, Guyana . This is my favorite corner of the Amazon, where I studied caimans in 2007, and it's beautifully preserved. It has miles upon miles of Victoria regia water lily-covered lakes, pristine forests, tranquil rivers and lush savannahs. Where to go: Karanambu Lodge is a private reserve with almost no hunting, so monkeys, birds, giant otters, anteaters and other wildlife are tame and easy to watch. 10 ultimate adventures around the United States . Etosha National Park, Namibia . Etosha is my favorite place in Africa to see wildlife. It's especially good if you have kids because it's easily accessible; the camps are very comfortable and safe; there's a big store with all kinds of supplies and the animals are always present in huge numbers. Where to go: In August and September you can sit on a bench facing a watering hole, and watch countless herds of antelopes, zebras, elephants, giraffes and other animals walk in from the desert. It's a better wildlife spectacle than the more popular Serengeti migration. Masoala Peninsula, Madagascar . Madagascar has so much biodiversity that biologists think of it as a small continent rather than a big island. Masoala has the largest remaining lowland rainforest there, still relatively pristine and containing a lot of yet undescribed plants and animals, as well as the most beautiful lemurs, the weirdest geckos and chameleons the size of a match. Where to go: Visit Masoala National Park, where you can arrange a variety of hikes, walking tours or overnight camping trips. Chukchi Peninsula, Russia . Chukotka is one of my favorite places to watch animals in Russia. The remotest and most fascinating part of Siberia, I explored it as a student during summer breaks, then led bird-watching tours there. Where to go: The gateway to the peninsula is the city of Anadyr, where you can snorkel with beluga whales and see lots of rare birds just outside the airport. There is almost no infrastructure, but if you manage to get away from populated areas, it's wonderful. 6 places where cats outshine tourist attractions . Karakoram Highway, China/Pakistan . The world's most scenic road, Karakoram Highway crosses an area of stunning cultural diversity. It is not always safe to visit, but whenever it's safe, it's a great adventure. I explored the Chinese side in 1993 during a four-month hitchhiking trip around China and visited the Pakistani part in 2004 to look for the woolly flying squirrel, the largest and rarest squirrel in the world. I eventually found it one magical winter night in the snow-covered forests of Nanga Parbat, the westernmost Himalayan peak. Where to go (if you dare): This isn't always a safe trip. From the Pakistani part of the road, I like to travel to Nanga Parbat Base Camp; to ancient castles of Hunza Valley; or up one of the numerous glaciers that terminate near the highway. In China, the area between Muztagata and Kungur Peaks has several lakes with splendid views of both peaks, and a camp where you can stay in a Kyrgyz yurt. The border crossing area is a nature reserve with lots of ibex, giant Marco Polo sheep and snow leopards. The Chinese side of the nature reserve is Taxkorgan Nature Reserve. The Pakistani side is Khunjerab National Park. Afar Desert, Ethiopia . Perhaps the world's hottest desert, Afar is also difficult and dangerous for travelers. Afar is also known as the place where the Earth's crust is breaking as Africa is slowly drifting away from Asia. I made a side trip there while crisscrossing Ethiopia in search of crocodile study sites. Where to go (if you dare): It has a boiling lava lake in the crater of Erta Ale Volcano, the world's weirdest hot springs at Dallol Volcano and beautiful waterfalls hidden in remote canyons. Looking for these watering holes in a roadless desert is a fun game of treasure hunt, but you can die if you fail. Plan accordingly. Democratic Republic of Congo . Africa's most biologically diverse country, it's full of mysterious wildlife such as bonobos, okapis, African peacocks and hero shrews. Large animals keep being discovered there, but some, such as the aquatic genet, have never been observed in the wild. I've been at the edges of this fascinating realm, and hope to explore it thoroughly someday. Where to go (if you dare):  Virunga National Park has a boiling lava lake and both lowland and mountain gorillas. Ituri Forest has okapis and other rarities and Itombwe Mountains has lots of unique plants and animals. But keep in mind the violent political conflict in the Congo makes it a difficult place to visit for tourists. 10 things to know before visiting Democratic Republic of Congo .","Alligator dances consist of nighttime courtship gatherings of up to a hundred gators .

"(CNN) -- At long last, the '60s TV series ""Batman"" is finally being released on DVD and Blu-ray. Fans of the Adam West and Burt Ward program have been waiting years for this moment, as a long-running rights dispute between 20th Century Fox and Time Warner (the latter is CNN's parent company) made it seem like it would never come. Before November 11, anyone hankering for classic ""Batman"" had to settle for recording episodes from cable on the DVR. When ""Batman"" made its TV debut in 1966, it was nothing short of a phenomenon. The first episode had huge ratings and launched a slew of Bat-merchandise as the dynamic duo invaded the public consciousness, appearing just about everywhere for much of that year. For a time, the show had people tuning in the following night -- ""same Bat-time, same Bat-channel"" -- to see how Batman and Robin got out of their latest jam. Up until Tim Burton's 1989 movie, the 1966 version of ""Batman"" was the best-known representation of the hero, and it's still fondly remembered nearly 50 years later. Here are five of the most memorable moments of the series, which ran from 1966 to 1968. (We're not counting Adam West and Burt Ward's tongue-in-cheek performances, which are in a league of their own.) 1. The Batusi . Right out of the gate, we knew we were in for something special. As Batman went into a nightclub (with the underage Robin waiting outside), he happened upon the Riddler's girlfriend, Molly. As the pair danced, Batman unleashed some moves of his own, and the Batusi was born (soon to be replicated in ""Pulp Fiction""). 2. The Joker faces the dynamic duo . Cesar Romero's first performance as the Joker three weeks into the series stands as one of its best episodes. Here we saw the Joker break out of jail, erect a statue of himself, pose as Pagliacci and more (in a plot based on one of the classic comic book issues). It was a tour de force, and he was the first actor to turn the Joker into the role of a lifetime. 3. The window cameos . When celebrities weren't able to be ""special guest villains,"" they ended up popping out of a window as Batman and Robin scaled the side of a building. Everyone from Jerry Lewis to Sammy Davis Jr. to Santa Claus turned up there. 4. Catwoman and Batman's neverending flirtation . Try as she might, Catwoman (played at various times by Julie Newmar, Eartha Kitt and Lee Meriwether) never could seduce Batman into a life of crime. And boy, did she try. And here's Batman and Robin taking on Catwoman's henchmen, because no list is complete without a little ""POW! BIFF! ZOWIE!"" 5. Batgirl arrives . By season three, the show was on the brink of cancellation and introduced Barbara Gordon, a.k.a. Batgirl. Yvonne Craig -- the first actress to portray a female superhero on live-action TV -- breathed new life into the show for a short time, but sadly, ABC pulled the plug as that season ended. (Legend has it that it was too late for NBC to pick up the show.) Of course, it's tough to narrow it down to five (and the less said about that surfing contest, the better).

"(CNN) -- Officers involved in a 2012 shooting in Cleveland are suing the city and police officials, alleging racial discrimination. They claim the defendants have a pattern of treating non-African American officers harsher than African American officers, when it comes to officer-involved shootings of African Americans. The plaintiffs in the federal suit are not African American. The incident cited in the suit began when officers saw a car speeding and heard what they thought was a gunshot directed towards them. It involved a nearly 25-minute chase and ended in a hail of 137 bullets, killing two people. Both were African American. No weapon was ever found in the car. In the wake of the shooting, the plaintiffs say they were placed on administrative leave for three days before reporting ""to the gym"" for a 45-day cooling off period. Months later, most of them were permitted to return to full duty, but they were then ordered back on restrictive duty, in a move the lawsuit claims was ""politically expedient."" They remained on restrictive duty until June 2014 and so missed out on potential wages and chances to apply for promotions and transfers, according to the lawsuit. The nine plaintiffs allege their treatment was because of their race. ""The City of Cleveland, through the other named defendants, and the other named defendants in their individual capacities, have a history of treating non-African American officers involved in the shootings of African Americans substantially harsher than African American officers,"" reads the lawsuit, filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. It continues: ""A serious dichotomy exists as a result of the defendants' longstanding practices and procedures which place onerous burdens on non-African American officers, including the plaintiffs, because of their race and the race of persons who are the subjects of the legitimate use of deadly force."" The plaintiffs are seeking an unspecified amount of damages. After-hours attempts Sunday to reach representatives of the city and police department were unsuccessful. The lawsuit comes on the heels of another high-profile police shooting in Cleveland. A 12-year-old boy died a week ago Sunday after being shot outside a recreation center. He had what police have said was an air gun that looked like a real firearm. Authorities are investigating that shooting, and the two officers involved are on leave from their jobs. In March 2013, the U.S. Justice Department announced an investigation into the use of force by Cleveland police, citing several incidents. That investigation is also ongoing. CNN's Sarah Jorgensen and Lateef Mungin contributed to this report.","The nine officers allege racial discrimination .

"(CNN) -- Less than a month ago Bob Dylan could justifiably feel he was revered in France. The singer was in Paris to receive France's highest public award, the Legion d'Honneur. As France's most prestigious medal was pinned to Dylan's lapel, his French hosts heaped praise on the 72-year-old legend for his contribution to music -- and notably his songs inspired by French poets Rimbaud and Verlaine. It was impossible to predict that, only three weeks later, Dylan would be embroiled in an ugly controversy that has resulted in preliminary charges against him in France for inciting racial hatred. Ironically, Dylan's comments were made about America, not France. In a Rolling Stone interview published in 2012, the singer was quoted as saying: ""If you got a slave master or Klan in your blood, blacks can sense that. That stuff lingers to this day. Just like Jews can sense Nazi blood and the Serbs can sense Croatian blood."" A Croatian group in France pressed charges against Dylan for his remarks. Now Dylan, who has performed in both Croatia and Serbia, finds himself in legal trouble in France for comments he made last year about racism in America. The Croatian group claimed that Dylan was equating all Croatians with the small minority of Croatian war criminals. The tension between Croatians and Serbs has deep historical roots, most recently with the breakup of former Yugoslavia, during which accusations of genocidal massacres were made on both sides. Farther back, during World War II when the political movement Ustasha ruled Croatia, it erected concentration camps for Jews, Serbs, Roma gypsies and other non-Catholic minorities. It is believed that roughly 320,000 ethnic Serbs were killed under the Nazi-allied Ustasha. In France, a country where racism is a sensitive issue, the controversy surrounding Dylan touches a raw nerve. The French have questioned themselves whether they are racist and xenophobic, especially toward the minority African and Muslim populations whose integration into French society has been rife with tensions and sometimes violence. French Minister of Justice Christiane Taubira, one of the country's most prominent black politicians, has been subjected to racial slurs. A right-wing French magazine, ""Minute,"" featured a headline about her: ""Crafty as a monkey, Taubira gets her banana back."" The famous French movie actress Brigitte Bardot has been convicted and fined for inciting racial hatred for her comments about Muslims in France after complaining on her website that Muslims were ""destroying our country by imposing their ways."" The French have also struggled with its history of anti-Semitism, which flared up during the infamous Dreyfus Affair at the end of the 19th century when a Jewish military officer was wrongfully accused and convicted of treason. France's collaboration with the Nazis during World War II is a shameful chapter in the country's past that was for decades swept under the carpet of collective memory. Today it is illegal in France to deny the Holocaust and incite racial hatred, and sell Nazi memorabilia on the Internet. (For example, a French judge in 2000 found the U.S.-based company Yahoo guilty of facilitating neo-Nazi auctions.) Dylan's published comments have opened old wounds in France. Yet there is something curious about the timing of these charges against him. First of all, the singer made the remarks to Rolling Stone last year; they were later published in a French version of the magazine. And the Croatian group's complaints against the singer apparently date to November 2012. It is interesting, too, that the preliminary charges by French prosecutors against Dylan were filed on November 11, only two days before the legendary singer was to receive his Legion d'Honneur from a Socialist government that is usually admiring of engagÃ© pop singers with a strong anti-establishment political message. In the stuffy precincts of the Legion d'Honneur's Grand Chancellerie, it appears that the government's nomination of Dylan for the award had originally been received sniffily. In May, French press reports claimed the 17-member Legion d'Honneur council had tossed out the nomination on the grounds that Dylan had been an anti-war radical during the Vietnam War and, moreover, had used drugs. It was only after some backroom intrigue that it was announced that Dylan would receive the Legion d'Honneur after all. Dylan fans doubtless find this whole thing perplexing. Yet it's not surprising that this blew up in a country where hate-speech accusations often reach the courts. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Matthew Fraser.","Bob Dylan has been charged with inciting racial hatred in France for some comments .

"(CNN) -- A third victim of last week's shooting at a Washington state high school has died, according to the hospital that treated victims. Fourteen-year-old Shaylee Chuckulnaskit died Friday night at Providence Regional Medical Center, not far from Marysville Pilchuck High School, where she and four other students were gunned down last Friday as they sat in the school cafeteria. ""The entire Providence family is deeply saddened by this news and we extend our heartfelt sympathy to Shaylee's family,"" the medical center said, added that the teenager known as Shay ""passed away ... as a result of severe injuries from last Friday's school shooting."" The Chuckulnaskit family released its own statement, saying: ""Our hearts are broken at the passing of our beautiful daughter. Shay means everything to us. ""In Shay's short life she has been a radiant light bringing us incredible joy and happiness. She has been a loving daughter, a caring sister, a devoted friend and a wonderful part of our community. We can't imagine life without her."" In the hours and days following the shooting, two other Marysville families were thrown into sudden mourning with the deaths of students Zoe Galasso and Gia Soriano. Shaylee was one of three students hospitalized after a gunman opened fire in the cafeteria. The shooter, Jaylen Fryberg, took his own life, in the school cafeteria.","Shaylee Chuckulnaskit was 14 years old .

"(CNN) -- They are the parents who canceled Christmas. John and Lisa Henderson of Hurricane, Utah, had finally had enough of their little hurricanes. For months, the couple had been trying to teach their three boys, ages 11, 8 and 5, to stop being disrespectful and acting entitled. ""We gave them good warning, either it was time for their behavior to change or there would be consequences,"" wrote Lisa Henderson, co-founder of the Over the Big Moon blog, in a recent post. ""We patiently worked with them for several months and guess what, very little changed. One day after a particularly bad display of entitlement John said, 'We should just cancel Christmas.' "" And that's what they did. Santa isn't coming to the Henderson house this year. The family is taking the money that would have been spent on gifts and using it for service projects and helping other people. It's not like her children suffer from a lack of toys, Lisa Henderson wrote. The family will still decorate and celebrate Christmas as the birth of Christ, and the children will still get presents from other family. Though they're taking some heat from critics who call them Scrooges, the gifts these parents are giving their children are so much more important than the latest popular ""Star Wars"" figure or electronic gadget soon relegated to the dustbin. These gifts will last a lifetime. The gift of consequences . How many times do parents threaten to take away the television/iPad/favorite toys unless their children start to behave? If the threats continue but there's never any follow-through, children come to believe that there aren't any consequences. They also learn that their parents can't be trusted to tell the truth. And they develop a nasty habit of manipulating to get what they want. The Henderson children will probably never doubt their parents' word again. The gift of perspective . Henderson knew that her children had plenty to be grateful for, including good food, a nice home and too many toys to count. What they needed was a dose of perspective, which they got. They used the Santa money to start a clothing drive for victims of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines and ship the goods overseas. They are also considering participating in an Adopt-a-Grandparent program. The gift of imagination . The boys aren't sitting around feeling sorry for themselves. Besides organizing as a family to do good works for others, the boys have responded by making gifts for each other and sneaking them into each child's stocking. ""They are learning exactly what we wanted them to learn, because they are not moping around feeling sorry for themselves,"" she wrote. ""They are thinking of others."" The gift of family . Christmas hasn't been completely canceled in the Henderson household. What's been canceled is an overwhelmingly commercial Christmas. Instead of a race to the tree to see what Santa brought, the focus on Christmas morning will be on spending time together with Lisa's cinnamon rolls, their faith, family games and the opportunity to ""truly enjoy the few presents they did get"" from grandparents and others. ""While this may not be the best choice for everyone, it feels right for our family right now,"" she wrote. ""Our kids get to focus on that feeling. I am almost certain this will be the best Christmas they ever have!""","Months of disrespectful behavior led John and Lisa Henderson to a drastic decision .

"(CNN) -- It looks like a throwback to the Apollo era, but NASA's new spaceship is roomier and designed to go far beyond the moon -- to an asteroid and eventually Mars. Orion is scheduled to lift off on its first test flight at 7:05 a.m. ET Thursday from Space Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. The launch window will be open for two hours and 39 minutes. Orion will climb to an altitude of 3,600 miles (15 times higher than the International Space Station) and orbit Earth twice during the four and a half hour test run, NASA says. The spaceship will splash down in the Pacific Ocean about 600 miles off the coast of Baja California. Two U.S. Navy ships, the USS Anchorage and the USNS Salvor, will help NASA recover the capsule. This first flight won't carry any astronauts, but it will move NASA closer to getting back in the crewed spaceflight business. The U.S. has had to pay Russia's space agency to launch astronauts to the space station since the space shuttle program ended in 2011. Orion's crew module is designed to carry four people on a 21-day mission. But it could support six astronauts for shorter missions. By comparison, the Apollo capsules held three astronauts and were out in space for about six to 12 days. Orion will be launched on a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket, the largest rocket available. NASA is building its own launch system for Orion. Though Orion's first flight won't have people on it, it won't go up empty. It will carry up the names of more than million people packed on a dime-sized microchip. ""Sesame Street"" is sending up some mementos to inspire students about spaceflight including Cookie Monster's cookie and Ernie's rubber ducky. Also going up -- an oxygen hose from an Apollo 11 lunar spacesuit and a small sample of lunar soil. A Tyrannosaurus Rex fossil from the Denver Science Museum will be on board and lockers filled with flags, coins, patches, poetry and music.","NASA's new spaceship Orion will be sent on atest flight Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Dan and Susan Hartmann are HIV discordant. He has HIV; she does not. They always have protected sex, which was never an issue, until they wanted to start a family. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people like Susan, who are in a discordant relationship, take pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, to protect against personal HIV exposure. But there is little research on how the medications affect a fetus. Meanwhile, adoption can be complicated when one parent is HIV positive. Assisted reproduction using IVF and techniques such as sperm washing (ridding the sperm of the virus before creating an embryo with an egg), are costly and illegal in some states, like California in 2007, when the Hartmanns were living there. So what's the best way for HIV discordant couples, like the Hartmanns, to have children? It's a question being asked more often as people with HIV are living somewhat normal lives with the disease and perhaps getting married and wanting to start a family. It is something at the top of mind on this World AIDS Day, which this year is focused on achieving an AIDS-free generation. The CDC estimates there are 140,000 mixed-status heterosexual couples, but that number is based on a 1996 study; experts say the number is much higher today. The Hartmanns are open about their journey to parenthood because they hope others will benefit from their experience. Dan Hartmann was diagnosed with HIV when he was 12, infected by contaminated blood products he received as treatment for hemophilia, a rare genetic blood disorder. ""It was scary,"" Dan remembers. ""There was definitely a time period ... toward the end of high school, college, you know, I wasn't sure I would be here now."" It was the '80s, and AIDS was all over the news. So was the story of an HIV-positive teen named Ryan White, who was expelled from his high school in Russiaville, Indiana, after revealing he had the disease. In Annapolis, Maryland, ninth grader Dan Hartmann was telling his school he, too, was HIV positive. Susan Slingluff was in the gym when Hartmann and his father, a physician, spoke to the school. ""It's OK to touch him. It's OK to share your pencil with him. It's OK to drink from the water fountain. You can use the same lavatory,"" she remembers being told. The discussion laid the groundwork for her connection to the HIV community. Susan and Dan went to prom together and then lost touch. Six years passed before Dan called Susan out of the blue. That phone call lasted two hours and sparked a bicoastal relationship. Eventually Dan relocated from Syracuse, New York, to San Francisco to be with Susan. They bought a house and got married. Susan dreamed of having children. But how? ""I was 26 and it wasn't immediately needed, so I just knew that we would start asking questions and do the research and figure out what we were going to do,"" Susan says. Susan read everything she could find about how a heterosexual married couple with one HIV partner could make a family but couldn't find answers. Not in research and not from their own health care providers. ""I don't think that doctors didn't want to share it, I just think they didn't have it,"" Susan says. ""We're just not the usual clientele."" In March 2007, the couple testified at a California Senate Health Committee hearing to repeal a law banning assisted reproduction techniques using HIV-infected sperm. The law was repealed and through the process they met experts who had the answers they were seeking. Over dinner one night, one such expert made a suggestion the Hartmanns describe as shocking: having unprotected sex. Because Dan had an undetectable viral load and they were in a monogamous relationship, the physician explained, the risk of Susan becoming infected with HIV from unprotected sex with her husband was low. Susan says it was somewhere between a 1 in 2,000 and 1 in 4,000 chance every time. It wouldn't mean throwing away the condoms. This was timed according to Susan's ovulation; on her most fertile days they'd try. They decided to try this approach for a few months. If either one of them changed their mind at any point they would stop. ""You check in and you're like, 'I'm feeling really nervous about this today, are you still OK with this?' And vice versa,"" Dan says. Some days, he woke up reminding himself that Susan was more likely to get struck by lightning than to become infected this way. Other days, he'd wake up wondering what on earth they were doing. After five tries in two months, Susan was pregnant. The excitement was building, but it was too early to breathe a sigh of relief. They still didn't know if Susan was infected with HIV. At three months, Susan's test results came back negative, which tempered concerns as they shared the news of Susan's pregnancy with family and friends. Subsequent tests at six and nine months were also negative. At that point, they knew their daughter would be OK. Now 4, Ryan is healthy and happy, just like her mom. She loves My Little Pony, swimming and even likes green vegetables. She doesn't know that her parents might be considered pioneers by some -- that they've paved the way for other HIV discordant couples. She knows her dad has hemophilia and takes medicine. They'll explain the rest later, Susan and Dan say. Susan insists it wasn't about luck; she says their decision was supported by science. Dan agrees. ""It's sort of like getting in the car. We wore our seat belts. It would have been more shocking for Susan to have gotten HIV than to have not,"" he says. Susan doesn't think about HIV every day. She says it's like a third, silent partner in their marriage. The Hartmanns may decide to expand their family, and if they do, they will see what science says at the time. They say they may decide to take the same approach. Or, Dan says, when the time comes, they may try assisted reproduction. For now, Dan is living the life he once thought he'd never live to see. He'll get to die of a heart attack in his 70s, Susan jokes, just like everyone else.","Dan and Susan Hartmann wanted to start a family, but Dan is HIV-positive .

"(CNN) -- There is an opening scene in Hollywood blockbuster ""Titanic"" when an alien-like submarine plunges to the darkest depths of the ocean. ""Seeing her coming out of the water like a ghost ship -- still gets me every time,"" murmurs treasure hunter Brock Lockett, gazing in awe at the sunken ship from his luminous capsule. More than 15 years after director James Cameron made his Oscar-winning film, it was his turn to scour the deep sea in a high-tech pod. But unlike his ""Titanic"" fictional character Lockett, Cameron wasn't in search of a sunken diamond -- instead he was gathering scientific data which could revolutionize our understanding of both deep sea creatures and earthquakes. Last year, the 57-year-old Canadian director of box office hits ""Avatar""and ""Terminator"" series, became the first person to reach the deepest point of the ocean solo. Cameron's remarkable journey 11-kilometers below the water in a seven-meter long sub, was part of a National Geographic fact-finding mission more than a year in the making. Predicting earthquakes . In a special interview with CNN, the filmmaker revealed the expedition could one day help scientists predict deep sea earthquakes -- and their devastating tsunamis. ""Building technology vehicles like the DeepSea Challenger to get down there, is a first step to planting large instruments which could allow us to survey seismic activity,"" explained Cameron. ""Ultimately it could lead to some predictive modeling which tells us 'look we've got pressure building up here, maybe this could be a tsunami in the Pacific rim, get ready, brace yourselves."" Dig deep . Cameron admitted we're still some way off predicting earthquakes, but until now we didn't have the technology to fully explore such depths as the Mariana Trench -- the deepest point in the ocean. The great chasm, located off the coast of Guam in the Pacific Ocean, is more than a mile deeper than Mount Everest is tall, and a whopping 120 times larger than the Grand Canyon. Cameron is just the third person to reach the Mariana Trench, since oceanographers Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard in 1960, and the only person to do so solo. He spent more than three hours exploring the ocean floor -- far longer than the 20 minutes Walsh and Jacques did in their huge blimp-like submersible 53 years ago. ""Before now, there was so little access to these deep trenches which, if you add them all together, constitute an area the size of North America,"" said Cameron. ""We simply didn't have vehicles that could function at that depth because of the extreme pressure, so the DeepSea Challenger represents a new generation of vehicles that will open up that frontier."" Alien life . But the ground-breaking expedition wasn't just a leap into the unknown -- the team also discovered dozens of species of marine life, some with mysterious cases of gigantism. ""We found 68 new species -- including around 60 new bacterial species never seen by science before,"" said Cameron. ""We also found examples of gigantism, which is as yet unexplained. Now don't imagine something 30 feet long, but if you have an animal that's normally a centimeter long suddenly appearing 10 or 20 times its normal size, how do you explain that?"" Small sub, big dreams . Cocooned in his lime green sub, in a world so deep under water that the sunlight doesn't penetrate and the pressure can be a thousand times that on land, Cameron admitted feeling ""like a walnut in his shell."" The 12-ton pod, designed by Cameron and his team of engineers, was made from a super-strong glass foam material able to withstand the immense pressure which shrunk it by three inches. Unlike Walsh and Piccard's 18-meter sub, which five decades ago was not equipped to take photos, today's cutting-edge DeepSea Challenger was armed with multiple cameras and a mechanical arm for scooping up rock and animal samples. Future generations . Back on dry land, the DeepSea Challenger will now tour schools across the U.S. as it winds its way to its final home at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. ""It's turned into this cross-country adventure for the sub and I believe that we'll be able to inspire young minds to want to pursue a career in engineering, maths, science, and exploration,"" said Cameron. The Canadian, who has made 72 deep sea dives, including 33 to the actual sunken ""Titanic,"" added that the government should be investing more in ocean research. ""There's always been a huge imbalance in the funds going into space exploration, and I don't begrudge that because I like exploration, but we definitely are underfunded in ocean science right now,"" he said. Fearless filmmaker . Cameron's next challenge however will not be on the ocean floor, but creating the second and third installments of his 2009 film ""Avatar"" -- the highest grossing movie of all time. Much like plummeting to the darkest depths of the sea, filmmaking presents its own pressure. As the three-time Academy Award winner said: ""I'd much rather deal with the physical threats of deep sea ocean diving or the potential failures of engineering, than I would the fickleness of an audience.""","""Titanic"" director James Cameron only person to reach deepest point of ocean solo .

"(CNN) -- Cricket has been hit by another tragedy in the same week Australian Test star Phillip Hughes died as result as a result of injuries he received after being struck by a ball in a match in Sydney. Hillel Oscar, 60, a former captain of the Israeli national team, was umpiring a match Saturday in his home town of Ashdod when he received an apparently fatal blow in a freak accident. Before the match between Young Ashdod and Super Lions Lod, the final game of the Israel domestic season, players and officials had held a minute's silence for Hughes, whose untimely death has led to a string of tributes across the world. Super Lions Lod was also to be given the championship trophy at the end of the match, but as Steve Leigh, the Deputy Chairman of the Israeli Cricket Association told CNN, that celebration was never to happen. Leigh was not at the match, but recounted what he had been told of the tragic incident. ""Midway through the first innings a ball was driven fiercely back towards the umpire (by the batsman). ""It hit the stumps and ricocheted but as Hillel tried to move out of the way the ball followed him and he was hit in the chest or just under the chin, it is still unclear exactly where. ""He collapsed immediately and according to witnesses who were there he may have had a heart attack."" Leigh said that the umpire was resuscitated by ambulance staff who were quickly on the scene, but he died later at a hospital in Ashdod. Englishman Leigh, 51, said the Israeli cricketing community had been left stunned by the incident. ""Hillel was much loved by everyone,"" he said . The Israel Cricket Association's CEO, Naor Gudker, paid his tribute on its official Facebook page. ""The entire Israel Cricket Association and players bow their heads in his memory. He was a wonderful man, cricketer, and umpire,"" Gudker said. Oscar, who was born in Bombay, was married with two daughters and a grandchild. His funeral was being held in Ashdod Sunday. Meanwhile Leigh said the association would co-operate fully with any official investigation into the incident, liaising with world governing body, the ICC. Unlike in sports such as baseball, cricket umpires are unprotected and do not wear helmets, despite the high speeds which the ball can be struck by batsman. But fatal incidents involving either players or umpires are extremely rare. An umpire at a match in Wales was killed five years ago after a ball thrown by a fielder hit him on the head. In the light of the recent accident, Leigh said that ""maybe there was need"" for umpires to wear helmets. Unlike Australia, Israel is not considered a major cricketing power, but there are several thousand active participants at all levels, with an 18-strong national league. Most of the adult players were originally born, like Oscar, in traditional cricket playing countries such as India, where it is the national sport.","Cricket umpire dies after freak accident in game in Israel .

"(CNN) -- By now, we have all heard the allegations made by numerous women that Bill Cosby sexually assaulted them. At least 15 have accused him of abuse, with the first incident in the late 1960s and the last in 2004. While his attorneys have denied most of these assertions, Cosby has publicly refused to comment. In fact just a few weeks ago, Cosby not only declined to answer an Associated Press reporter's question about the claims, he told the reporter that he would appreciate it if any reference to the allegations not appear in the story. So now what? Well, it's not likely Cosby will be criminally prosecuted. The only alleged incident that clearly falls within the criminal statute of limitations is the one involving Andrea Constand. That event purportedly took place in 2004 in Pennsylvania, a state that provides victims with 12 years to file a criminal complaint in sexual assault cases. But don't count on seeing a criminal action. In part, because the prosecutor didn't find sufficient evidence to prosecute back in 2005. In addition, Cosby paid an undisclosed sum to Constand in 2006 to settle the civil lawsuit arising from the alleged sexual assault. I can tell you as a former trial lawyer that that civil settlement would have, without a doubt, included a release by Constand of all claims against Cosby, including criminal. Cosby's career has been deeply damaged by the ongoing scandal and he has been denounced pretty much everywhere. Is there something that he could do now that could persuade the millions of people who were once his fans to potentially see him again as a comedian, not as a serial rapist -- which is how I now see him? I posed this question on social media: What do we want from Bill Cosby now? The responses revealed an interesting cross section of opinion from men and women on all sides of the issue. And while they varied greatly, a common theme emerged. But before I mention that one, here are some of the often thought-provoking comments I received in response to the question. Nothing I suppose... nothing he could say justifies anything he has done @germanphile . ... He should 100% retire so his victims never have to be reminded of his presence again @sidra_zaidi . Want to hear how could criticize blacks for years knowing he had these demons in his closet! @ChrisAlanComedy: . Leave him alone. @MLCzone . ""Make a massive donation to a rape prevention program."" Comment on Facebook from Lynn Harris . If he's guilty, which it seems that he is, then he deserves to go to prison for his crimes regardless of his age.  @wmzraz . ""He should apologize to his victims. Maybe pay compensation as well."" Comment on Facebook from Basel Ammane. ... WE must turn tragedy into teachable moment. @kthalps . Car battery, jumper cables and a narcoleptic switchwoman  @maverick_kris . These comments truly reflect the range of responses I received, with many advocating Cosby be imprisoned and a few defending him. But the most common reaction was this: . ""Tell the truth!"" Comment on Facebook from Lala Elborno . Ownership...and not just of stock in jello. @EllieRFox . Acknowledge that even if you're innocent, your silence is damaging everything you stood for, even the good things  @Brennanator . I would like him to address it and stop hiding. @Rizo78 . It's clear that people, regardless of where they stand on the issue, want Cosby to publicly and directly address the claims. After all, Cosby has made his living for decades speaking to the public as a comedian; his silence adds to the sense that he's hiding something. But this silence appears calculated. Perhaps he thought we would collectively move on when the next big story came along. Or maybe he banked on the fact that when three women came forward in the mid-2000s to make similar allegations of sexual misconduct, we simply didn't seem to care. Sadly, I was among those who didn't pay much attention. Silence this time won't work for Cosby. Already he has lost TV deals with NBC and Netflix. His reputation is in shambles. And while Cosby has escaped criminal prosecution, it's clear that in the court of public opinion, many have found Cosby guilty. Will Cosby ever come forward and address the issues head on? Unlikely. But the upside to this incident, if one can be found, is that the allegations have raised awareness about sexual assault. In fact, the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, an organization that combats sexual assault, said last Monday that the national publicity over the Cosby scandal has caused a 50% increase in phone calls to the National Sexual Assault Hotline. It appears that the courageous women who have come forward with these allegations against Cosby have inspired other women to report sexual assaults that they have endured. And maybe, just maybe, the media attention concerning the allegations against Cosby will even save some women from suffering the same fate in the future.","Dean Obeidallah: Bill Cosby likely won't face charges in sex assault allegations .
He asked on social media: What do we want from Cosby?
Some said give money to rape prevention programs, apologize, compensate alleged victims .
Obeidallah: Unlikely Cosby will address the issue, but one good thing: Our awareness is raised ."
"Washington (CNN) -- The Justice Department plans to expand a ban on ethnic and religious profiling in federal investigations, ending an exemption for national security investigations, sources tell CNN. But the Obama administration's plans to have a government-wide policy are on hold because the Department of Homeland Security won't adopt the new rules for its agencies, which include Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In a concession to national security officials, the new Justice Department rules also still would allow federal agents to recruit informants based on ethnic data. The DHS exemption is a major concession for Obama administration officials and some supporters in Congress who have sought a broader ban on profiling. The new rules are nearing completion after nearly five years of internal debate, and the Justice Department is expected to announce them in the coming weeks. Two U.S. law enforcement officials familiar with the changes described them to CNN. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder spoke out against profiling in a recent visit to Ferguson, Missouri, citing his own experience as a young prosecutor when police stopped him in Washington's Georgetown neighborhood. Holder takes credit for lower federal prison population . The new Justice Department policy would expand the profiling ban to include religion, national origin, sexual orientation and gender. The Los Angeles Times reported Friday on the near completion of the profiling rules. The many challenges or replacing Eric Holder . The new policy replaces one put in place in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which exempted national security investigations from guidelines that generally prohibit profiling. Holder, who announced plans to resign last week, has made civil rights issues a major part of his legacy. As Holder pushed for changes to the profiling policy, he faced pushback from the FBI, which reports to him, and ultimately from DHS. Some FBI agents have said the changes will make their work harder to carry out. But in the end the bureau decided it could live with changes that permit certain agents to target certain communities for recruitment of informants. Holder: My work on voting rights most important . Farhana Khera, executive director of Muslim Advocates and a supporter of a broader ban on profiling, says allowing Homeland Security agencies to continue under the old policy would raise concerns. ""After 9/11 the pendulum has swung too far,"" she said, citing experiences of Muslims, including American citizens, who are questioned at ports of entry. ""There's been a pattern of incidents in recent years,"" she said. A Homeland Security official said the agency continues to work with the Justice Department to produce the new profiling policy.","New policy won't affect law enforcement agencies that fall under Homeland Security .

"(EW.com) -- Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill may play totally inept undercover cops in ""21 Jump Street,"" but at the box office, they're proving much more effective. The R-rated comedy scored a tremendous $35 million in its opening weekend, enough to easily top the chart. ""21 Jump Street"" opened in the same range as films like ""Bad Teacher"" ($31.6 million), ""Superbad"" ($33.1 million), ""Wedding Crashers"" ($33.9 million), and ""Scary Movie"" ($42.3 million), but each of those films opened in the summer, when R-rated fare like ""The Hangover"" and ""Bridesmaids"" has traditionally captured raunch-loving audiences. For ""21 Jump Street"" to earn $35 million over a weekend in mid-March is a far more impressive achievement. Indeed, only one R-rated comedy has ever debuted to higher numbers outside the summer season: ""Jackass 3-D,"" which started with $50.4 million in October 2010. ""21 Jump Street"" also opened higher than fellow TV adaptations ""Starsky and Hutch"" ($28.1 million), ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" ($30.7 million), and ""Miami Vice"" ($25.7 million). The strong debut marks a return-to-form for star Jonah Hill, whose live-action comedic catalog seemed less impressive after unremarkable box office performances from ""The Sitter"" ($30.4 million total) and ""Get Him to the Greek"" ($61 million), and a slew of more dramatic roles in ""Cyrus,"" ""Moneyball,"" and ""Funny People."" ""21 Jump Street"" finally delivered on the expectations set up by Hill's breakout role in ""Superbad,"" which earned $121.5 million total in 2007. Channing Tatum, meanwhile, scored his second straight hit after ""The Vow,"" which has a running total of $121.1 million. These numbers bode well for his next two releases, ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" and ""Magic Mike,"" both out in June. Sony and MGM, who have a potential juggernaut franchise on their hands, spent a sensible $42 million on ""21 Jump Street,"" which earned a ""B"" CinemaScore grade from polled audiences. In second place, Universal's smash animated hit ""The Lorax"" dipped 41 percent in its third weekend to $22.8 million. After 17 days, the 3D film has found an impressive $158.4 million, already more than the last Dr Seuss adaptation, ""Horton Hears a Who,"" which grossed $154.5 million total in 2008. Also impressive is the film's per theater average, which remains a robust $6,049, even in its third weekend 3-D ticket prices are certainly helping). Considering ""The Lorax,"" which cost $70 million to produce, is headed for a final domestic gross right around $200 million, it's no surprise that Universal and Illumination Entertainment are now getting to work on an animated version of ""The Cat in the Hat."" Disney's expensive misfire ""John Carter"" dropped by 55 percent in its sophomore frame to third place and $13.5 million. The $250 million project has now earned $53.2 million after ten days, and if it continues to play like a frontloaded fanboy flick (and it will), it will finish its run around $80 million. International receipts will need to be utterly gargantuan to save the Edgar Rice Borroughs adaptation -- it's taken in $126.1 million overseas so far. ""Project X"" and ""A Thousand Words"" came in fourth and fifth place, respectively. ""Project X"" fell 64 percent to $4 million, giving the party flick a total of $48.1 million against a $15 million budget. Eddie Murphy's ""A Thousand Words"" dropped by a slim 39 percent to $3.8 million, for a two-weekend total of $12.1 million. The $40 million comedy will join the ranks of ""Imagine That"" ($16.1 million) and ""Meet Dave"" ($11.8 million) as major Eddie Murphy bombs. Over on the limited release front, Will Ferrell comedy ""Casa De Mi Padre"" proved to be the most caliente smaller title, drawing in $2.2 million from just 382 locations, enough for a sturdy per theater average of $5,759. ""Friends With Kids,"" meanwhile dipped by 26 percent to $1.5 million despite expanding from 369 to 641 theaters. Jason Segel/Ed Helms collaboration ""Jeff, Who Lives at Home"" proved less appealing, earning $840,000 from 254 theaters, though that was way better than Nicholas Cage thriller ""Seeking Justice,"" which found $260,000 from 231 theaters. Perhaps a direct-to-DVD run would have been a better option. 1. ""21 Jump Street"" -- $35.0 million . 2. ""The Lorax"" -- $22.8 mil . 3. ""John Carter"" -- $13.5 mil . 4.

"(CNN) -- Pirates Thursday hijacked a German-owned tanker in the Gulf of Aden, the waterway between Africa and the Middle East which has become one of the world's most dangerous shipping lanes. The U.S. Navy has been joined by other countries to police the Gulf of Aden. The MV Longchamp was seized by seven pirates early in the morning, said a spokesman for the ship's owner, Bernhard Schulte Ship Management Company, of Hamburg, Germany. The company received a phone call from the ship's captain which was ""literally around three seconds.He said they'd been seized by pirates, that no one was injured, no dead ... and then clac, the phone went dead,'"" said the spokesman, who did not give his name. He said the company has heard nothing from the pirates themselves and had no information on how the vessel had been seized. The coalition of countries patrolling the sea lanes in response to the outbreak of piracy there was not involved in the incident, said Lt. Nathan Christensen, a public affairs officer for the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, which is based in the region. He said he did not know if the coalition had received a distress call. The Longchamp carries a a crew of 12 Filipinos and one Indonesian, Christensen said. The tanker is carrying the chemical vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), the owner's spokesman said.","Pirates hijack German-owned tanker in Gulf of Aden .

"(CNN) -- With travel to Africa poised to hit all-time highs in 2014, a drop-off in travel bookings was the last thing the continent's lucrative safari industry thought it would be facing going into 2015. But despite the fact that the main safari destinations in southern and eastern Africa are thousands of kilometers from the Ebola-stricken countries of the west, industry leaders say fears of the disease are keeping tourists away. A survey based on feedback from more than 500 safari operators conducted by African booking company Safaribookings.com found that as of late September, more than half reported a 20 to 70% decline in bookings. ""Numerous safari tour operators report to us that clients view Africa as a single country when it comes to risk assessment,"" Wouter Vergeer, Safaribookings.com founder, tells CNN. Vergeer says the impact is most noticeable in East Africa, home to safari hotspots such as Kenya's Masai Mara and Tanzania's Serengeti -- places located nearly 5,000 kilometers from the West Africa Ebola outbreak area. ""Most people don't realize how vast Africa is and that East and southern Africa are just as far from the outbreak area as Europe or South America,"" says Vergeer. ""All safari countries have enacted strict precautionary measures and as there currently are no Ebola cases the risk of infection is effectively zero."" Using music to fight Ebol in Liberia . Convincing clients they'll be safe . Jake McCormick, a safari specialist with Shadows of Africa, says the Ebola outbreak has caused a 70% decrease in inquiries at his company, which offers tours in Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda and Zanzibar. ""We are still working to try to convince clients they are safe from this disease, but until we see the outbreak come under control my feeling is that it will be a while until things return to normal,"" he says. Joao Oliveira, founder of It Started in Africa, which organizes safaris and Kilimanjaro treks in Tanzania and Kenya, tells a similar story. ""We did not have any cancellations but we had much fewer bookings,"" he says. ""The reason I believe there have been no cancellations is because the clients who have already paid -- safaris are usually booked several months in advance and a down payment is required -- do their own research and find out that the Ebola countries are more than 5,000 kilometers away from Tanzania or Kenya. ""As for the reduction in bookings, I believe it is because those who are planning their vacations are now not even considering going to Africa because of Ebola."" Oliveira says 2014 was on track to be his company's most profitable year to date. Then, as news of the Ebloa crisis spread, panic set in. ""In July, we projected that August would be our best month ever and then the panic started and August was the worst month of the last two years. September was the same."" He says October looks like it's improving slightly but it's difficult to tell at this point. ""It does not make sense,"" he adds. ""You would not cancel your vacation in Paris because there are conflicts in the Middle East or in Ukraine. If something nasty was happening in Alaska, you'd still go to New York."" 'Africa is seen as a country' Brett Thomson, managing director of Sun Safaris, says that in addition to traveler queries being down 50 to 70%, new bookings compared with last October are also down about 50%. ""Over the past month we have had numerous clients replying that they will be in touch after all the health scares are over,"" says Thomson. ""Even if we explain how far southern Africa is from West Africa, it does not change their mind. Africa is seen as a country and hardly ever as a continent."" Daniel Njamwea, managing director of safari travel booking company Lilac Adventures, agrees that it's been difficult trying to convince clients how far East Africa is from West Africa -- especially Kenya. ""This morning I was dealing with clients over Skype who are coming on October 25 and are worried since they read in the news that there is a woman who died at Jomo Kenyatta airport last weekend and feared that she had Ebola,"" says Njamwea. ""It was hard to convince them that she tested negative for Ebola. I had to refer them to Ministry of Health website to read more details."" The other big problem, say those in the industry, is a lack of knowledge of how Ebola is contracted. ""Although the Ebola virus is not airborne at this time and can only be caught through coming in contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person, and is currently limited to destinations in West Africa, we have recently experienced a small number of clients deferring their holiday plans to the rest of the continent,"" says Charlie Bateson, product director of high end travel company Abercrombie & Kent. ""We remain in constant contact with the FCO, WHO and with tourist boards and our supplier partners across the world. ""Our tour consultants are given the latest news on developments and have the ability to specifically advise clients on how the virus is transmitted so that they are able to allay clients fears."" Meanwhile, Rose Hipwood of the Luxury Safari Company says the top end of Africa's safari market hasn't been hit as hard by Ebola fears ""since many of those clients are international travelers and can look at the situation sensibly."" ""Some clients have indeed decided not to book safaris this year after inquiring -- but sadly in this industry we get a lot of time wasters and I believe those people would have found another reason not to book if not Ebola, although families are always more protective of their little ones,"" says Hipwood. Africa tourism was poised for growth . Though no figures have been released on the overall impact Ebola has had on African tourism, in the first half of 2014 the industry had been experiencing impressive growth rates. According to the World Tourism Organization's 2014 global travel report, Africa was due to see 4 to 6% tourism growth this year. In 2013, the continent saw international arrivals increase 5% over 2012, the equivalent of 3 million more tourists, to reach 56 million. ""This year is (now) written off already,"" says Njamwea, of Lilac Adventures. ""By this time hotels should be issuing stop sales for the Christmas period, but I have seen none, meaning they still have availability. ""Though this could have been due to other factors like cancellations of direct charter flights from Europe due to security risks, Ebola has too played a great part."" London-based James Strawson tells CNN he'd been considering a trip to Gambia in late November until the Ebola crisis erupted. ""I wanted to go away for some winter sunshine,"" he says. ""I've been to Gambia previously and it's a good time zone, easy to get to and quite nice and warm."" Strawson, 26, said media ""hysteria"" related to Ebola changed his mind. ""I just looked at the headlines and thought, it looks bad now, who knows what it will look like in a few weeks?"" Strawson, who works in finance, says he's not completely ruled out an Africa trip and is now planning a vacation in Zanzibar. 'World-class epidemiological detective work' Since the outbreak started in March, about 9,000 Ebola cases and 4,493 deaths have been reported, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). More than half of the deaths have been in Liberia. And the numbers are expected to skyrocket. There could be up to 10,000 new Ebola cases per week in the three hardest-hit nations by the end of the year, the WHO said. It warned that things will get worse before they get better. In August, WHO issued a warning saying Kenya had a high risk of experiencing an Ebola outbreak, but as yet the country hasn't seen a single case. The WHO says it's due to declare the end of the Ebola outbreak in Senegal and Nigeria on Friday and Monday, respectively. ""In a piece of world-class epidemiological detective work, all confirmed cases in Nigeria were eventually linked back to the Liberian air traveler who introduced the virus into the country on July 20,"" said WHO in a statement. Precautionary measures in eastern and southern African countries fighting to keep Ebola from entering their borders vary, with some countries banning travelers who have visited affected countries, while others have adopted strict border screening measures. Botswana, for instance, has reportedly suspended entry for travelers who have visited Liberia, Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone in the last 30 days. In Tanzania, all major border posts have mandatory health screening in place, including all international airports. South Africa refuses to admit foreign citizens arriving from Ebola-affected countries in West Africa, while South African citizens will be allowed to re-enter, but only after being subject to strict screening. The Africa Travel Association (ATA), a global trade association that promotes travel and tourism to Africa, released a statement to CNN. ""According to the WHO, the most severely affected countries are Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, however, the Africa tourism industry has felt stark repercussions across the continent through economic losses, canceled flights and bookings, closed borders and negative perceptions,"" it said. ""These impacts reach far beyond the borders of those affected countries. ATA urges the travel industry and traveling public to remain cautious, however, to acknowledge the immense size of the continent and to continue to travel to the vast majority of the countries that remain safe.""","Safari operators report cancellations, huge drop in bookings due to Ebloa fears .

"(CNN) -- That was a pretty catchy, sing-songy version of Sir Mix-A-Lot's rap hit ""Baby Got Back"" in Thursday night's episode of ""Glee."" It was also very familiar to fans of indie singer-songwriter Jonathan Coulton. As angry Coulton fans are clamoring on Twitter, Coulton arranged and recorded an eerily similar ""Baby Got Back"" cover. So similar, in fact, that the ""Glee"" version included Coulton's line ""Johnny C's in trouble,"" replacing the lyric ""Mix-A-Lot's in trouble"" in the original song. Coulton said he was not informed beforehand, nor was he given any credit or compensation for having arranged the melody of the cover song. What's more, he says, Fox Broadcasting representatives told Coulton's representatives that ""they're within their legal rights to do this, and that I should be happy for the exposure,"" he wrote on his blog, ""even though they do not credit me, and have not even publicly acknowledged that it's my version -- so you know, it's kind of SECRET exposure."" A representative from 20th Century Fox Television told CNN Friday the network is not commenting on the matter. Coulton, known for nerdy and humorous songs such as ""Code Monkey,"" said Friday that he is ""mystified"" about why the show went about using the cover song in this way. ""Glee has a reputation for being a show that celebrates the underdog,"" he said, before catching a plane to San Francisco. ""It's the anti-bullying show. But this is a bullying way to approach this."" When it comes to copyright protection, however, there's a distinction between what might seem ethical and what is legal, lawyers say. The rights to ""Baby Got Back"" belong with songwriter Anthony L. Ray, also known as Sir Mix-A-Lot, and his music publisher, Universal, who have apparently given proper licenses to Fox and ""Glee,"" said Kevin Parks, a copyright attorney with the Leydig law firm in Chicago who does not represent any party involved in what Twitter users are calling #JoCoGleeGate. Because Coulton's cover is derivative of the original work by Sir Mix-A-Lot, Coulton does not have a copyright claim against ""Glee"" for using the Coulton version, Parks said. Covers don't get their own copyright protection as far as the underlying musical composition, Parks said. But Coulton might have legal footing if the show used Coulton's audio track. ""If 'Glee' used parts of Coulton's actual recording, there would be a copyright claim for him to pursue,"" Parks said. ""If not, Coulton's gripe may have moral weight, but not the force of law."" Fans of Coulton are not taking this lightly. Some are undertaking sophisticated audio analyses of both song versions, Coulton said. One called ""alacrion"" created a side-by-side comparison of the two songs on SoundCloud, demonstrating a remarkable resemblance. A fan named Paul Potts posted his own investigation into the similarities of the audio, which he called ""pretty convincing."" ""Hilariously, for me, it comes down to the sound of a duck quacking, which is a sound effect that was in my version, used as a bleep noise to cover up an expletive,"" Coulton said. ""While it is very hard to hear, if I at home mess with the equalizer settings and some filters, I can actually hear that quack is in that mix."" From this, Coulton believes at least some of his audio was used by the show, although he is unsure how much. Potts explored this quack issue as well, but wrote on his blog that he identified the ""ghost of the quack."" There have been infringement cases involving rap songs that sampled even four to eight seconds of other songs, and that was deemed illegal, said Mark Lemley, director of the Stanford University program in law, science & technology who is also not representing anyone in this controversy. It may seem like an artist should get paid if his song, whether a cover or something else, is imitated elsewhere, but this is ""one of those holes in the law that just doesn't end up giving the owner of the sound recording copyright much in the way of rights,"" Lemley said. Coulton said his lawyer is in touch with ""the people at 'Glee.'"" Geek celebrities such as the band They Might Be Giants and podcaster Chris Hardwick came out in support of Coulton on Twitter. Astronomer Phil Plait, author of Slate's ""Bad Astronomy"" column, tweeted with a link to another story about the debacle: ""I'll admit it: I used to watch and enjoy Glee. Not any more. It's dead to me."" As of this writing, Sir Mix-a-Lot has not responded on his own Twitter account.","Indie artist Jonathan Coulton says 'Glee' used his cover song .

"(CNN) -- $1.3 billion is enough money to buy the Los Angeles Lakers or a big stake in the U.S. government. That's just about the amount candidates and special interest groups backed by global corporations, billionaires and millionaires will spend on political ads before Election Day in an attempt to sell you America's Next Top Congressman. As big money floods the midterms, it drowns out the voices of ""we the people."" Maine's Republican State Sen. Ed Youngblood gets it. He writes, ""As money in politics increases, the role of the general public in our democracy diminishes, more and more citizens feel their vote does not matter, and fewer are compelled into public service."" That's exactly what's happening. With just days left to go before the November 4 election, only about 15% of Americans are closely paying attention to it. The rest of us -- the sane ones -- have just tuned it out. But we shouldn't be joking. Big money has diminished our most important and fundamental right as American citizens: the right to vote. The result is a government of, by and for fat cats and plutocrats. There is another way. Just look northeast to Youngblood's great state of Maine. Besides potatoes, blueberries and lobster, the Pine Tree State boasts Clean Elections. This system of publicly financed elections makes it easier for citizens to run for elected office, especially those who lack membership in the Millionaires Club. After the Clean Elections law (first in the nation) was enacted in 2000, the number of female candidates increased, with 84% of women who ran for public office citing it as very or somewhat important in their decision to run. Maine also saw a huge drop in the average number of uncontested races -- from 31 to three -- as well as a surge in voter turnout that continues to outpace the national average. By 2008, more than 80% of candidates in Maine were running their campaigns with public funding, without any special interest money. The law was praised and used by Democrats and Republicans. For once, everybody seemed to agree on something. After a decade of success, the Clean Election system was hit by a rash of bad news -- damaging court decisions, severe budget cuts, legislative action and inaction, gubernatorial vetoes, etc. All of these things severely weakened the system. Publicly funded candidates could no longer compete against opponents who were backed by big donors and special interest groups. This year, only 51% of candidates in Maine are using public funding. But Mainers are fighting like junkyard dogs to take back their elections. A citizen-led Clean Elections initiative is underway that includes measures to strengthen Clean Elections and increase transparency and accountability in campaign finance laws. It's good policy, timely and important. Hundreds of Maine residents have mobilized, working to restore and fully fund the Clean Elections law. Grassroots supporters have collected more than 15,000 signatures to ensure a Clean Elections initiative is on the ballot in 2015. On Election Day, nearly 1,000 volunteers will staff polling places across the state to collect the necessary signatures from fellow Mainers to ensure that they have the opportunity to demand Clean Elections from the voting booth next year. In many other states, we don't have the opportunity to voice our frustrations about big money in politics at the ballot box, but we can still send a message to Washington. That's why I started StampStampede.org. It's a way for anybody, anywhere, anytime to turn his or her money into media by rubber stamping it with messages such as ""Not to be Used for Bribing Politicians"" and ""Stamp Money Out of Politics."" So long after Election Day, we can keep (legally) decorating our dollars to help build a nationwide, grassroots movement to get big money out of politics. That's what I'll be doing. But our friends in Maine will do more. I applaud Youngblood and all of the good citizens who will be at the polls, rain or shine, to greet fellow voters on Election Day. They won't settle for a diminished Clean Election system -- they're fighting hard to make it strong. Their work on the Clean Elections Initiative is grassroots democracy in action.","About a billion dollars will be spent by special interests on midterm elections .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- As emerging markets slump and the euro zone continues to struggle, the Philippine economy made a surprising surge in the first part of this year. The slowdowns in BRIC countries, China in particular, are feared to drag down the global economy. But in the first quarter of 2012, the Philippine economy grew 6.4%, the fastest since 2010 and already far outpacing the International Monetary Fund's forecast growth of 3.5% for this year. The growth surge was driven in part by a recovery of electronics exports after a decline in demand last year, while analysts say the economy was buoyed by strong domestic consumption. It is the money sent home to the Philippines by its overseas workers, known as remittances, and the rise of outsourced call centers that serve as the long-term stabilizers relatively unhindered by a sagging global economy, according to analysts. ""About 70% of our economy is from consumption, so remittance is the key fuel behind that,"" said Haj Narvaez, Manila-based head of research for the Philippines at Credit-Suisse. ""It drives consumption in malls. Even on the property side, the government estimates a third of remittances go into home purchases and rentals of properties."" It is estimated that 11% of the population of 92 million work overseas. Remittances account for about 10% of the country's GDP, which totaled $225 billion in 2011. Because Filipinos head to a wide variety of countries to work, the diversity protects them from the full impact of regional economic troubles. The Middle East has the largest portion of the Philippines' overseas labor force, with 61% working there. Asia is the next highest, with 27%, followed by the 6% in Europe. Moreover, these migrants often work as domestic workers, nurses or skilled technicians, types of jobs that are believed to be less vulnerable during an economic slowdown. ""You have an aging population in the West, and you have a young population here in the Philippines that is waiting to do jobs that some people in the West aren't willing to do,"" Narvaez said. Another sector that has helped drive consumption is the call center industry, which has overtaken India's as the largest over the past decade. These jobs are considered well - paid -- enough for workers to afford, after several years' employment, down payments on condominiums in Manila's booming property market, Narvaez said. These jobs could leave the country structurally well positioned going into a slowdown; as wealthier economies seek to cut costs, they tend to increase outsourcing to low-cost, English-speaking markets like the Philippines. Singapore-based Edward Teather, the senior economist for ASEAN at UBS, said the Philippines has experienced ""a virtuous circle of improved stability"" with more investments, lower inflation, currency valuations going up and interest rates coming down. Other factors that have aided in the country's growth early this year are the transfer of operations to the Philippines from Thailand by flood-disrupted businesses, said Teather, as well as improved electronics exports. While most analysts are optimistic, they do not expect growth for the year to be maintained at the first quarter's level -- Bloomberg's compiled predictions for GDP growth in 2012 averages at 4.2%. Standard & Poor's upgraded the country's debt rating last Wednesday to BB+, one notch below investment grade. Last Friday, the Philippines Stock Exchange Index hit an all-time high. The peso was the best performer among the 11 major Asian currencies, according to Bloomberg, up 5% against the dollar this year. Cuts in interest rates and the government's plans to spend more aggressively have boosted investor confidence in the Philippines, which has a third of its population living below the poverty line of $1.25 per day. Economists also credit President Benigno Aquino for his efforts to push back corruption and undertake infrastructure projects. ""You can see evidence of construction activity in Manila,"" Teather said. ""You can see cranes on the horizon. You can see new roads have been put in place.""","In the first quarter of 2012, the Philippine economy grew 6.4%, outpacing expectations .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- It's been a bad month for Japanese conservative politicians who can't seem to resist the temptation to rewrite history and make provocative gestures while shifting and minimizing war responsibility. Yoshihide Suga, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's overworked spokesman, has been in damage control mode, issuing numerous denials while restating and reinterpreting controversial statements. Abe is feeling confident as polls show strong public support, mostly because he has ignited the stock market with massive quantitative easing. Now he is showing his true ideological colors and galvanizing his base by recanting on apologies and war guilt. But can his slick PR machine repair the damage inflicted on Japan's reputation and credibility? History matters because Japan has made it into an issue that further antagonizes China and South Korea at a time when Japan would like their cooperation in dealing with the North Korean threat. Trampling on the neighbors' sensitivities about their shared past also limits room for managing territorial disputes involving both countries or making headway on a range of other pressing issues. War responsibility also matters because conservative loudmouths tarnish the national reputation by backtracking on previous apologies and muddying the waters on what exactly Japan acknowledges about its wartime excesses. The U.S. Congressional Research Service recently criticized Abe-history for roiling regional relations in ways detrimental to American interests. Ironically, Abe promised to improve relations with Washington during last year's lower house election campaign, but just as in 2007 when he quibbled about the extent of coercion used in recruiting so-called ""comfort women,"" he is undermining bilateral ties. Given heightened regional tensions, it seems absurd that Abe and other conservatives are seeking dignity in denial and implying that Japanese aggression was justifiable and not a colossal catastrophe. The ""Dr. Feelgoods"" of Japanese history who embrace an exonerating and validating narrative of Japan's Asian rampage 1931-45 do a great disservice to their country. They are embedded in the political mainstream and dominate the Abe cabinet, but their retrograde views on history are not supported by public opinion. Abe has long championed a beautifying of Japan's history inconsistent with established facts and seeks to promote patriotic education. There is much that Japan can be proud of since 1945 -- rapid recovery from war devastation, adopting a pacifist Constitution, the economic miracle, achieving the best living standards in the region, creating a robust democracy in a relatively egalitarian society, and promoting regional economic development through massive aid and technical cooperation. But conservatives seek to vindicate Japan's imperial aggression and pretend that it was really about liberating Asians from the yoke of Western colonialism. Japanese historians have exposed this as a sham, pointing out that Prime Minister Hideki Tojo's (1941-44) wartime diary emphasized the need for ousting the colonial powers, not to liberate them but in order to seize Asian resources to win the ongoing war aimed at subjugating China. Towards the end of April, three cabinet ministers, including Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso, visited the Yasukuni Shrine, the talismanic ground zero for a valorizing view of Japanese aggression that is fully displayed at the adjacent Yushukan Museum. Soon after, a phalanx of 168 LDP lawmakers also genuflected at this sacred space of unrepentant imperialism. Subsequently Abe quibbled in the Japanese parliament remarks about how to define ""aggression,"" and in doing so subverted the 1995 Murayama Statement that expresses regret for Japan's colonial rule and aggression. On May 10, spokesman Suga sought to douse the brushfires by insisting that Abe has never denied Japan's history of aggression and unequivocally supports the Murayama Statement. This wink-and-nod approach to history may be politically expedient, but is unconvincing and inevitably puts Japan back on the defensive because the government looks like it is shirking. And history is the gift that keeps on giving as the LDP policy chief Sanae Takaichi, appearing on television on May 12, told viewers that in fact Abe doesn't accept the verdict of the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal, again denied by Suga, while she also slammed the Murayama Statement. Then it was the turn of Osaka's outspoken mayor. Toru Hashimoto courted controversy when he suggested that the ""comfort women,"" tens of thousands of teenage girls mostly from the Korean peninsula forced into providing sexual services for Japanese soldiers between 1931-45, offered a ""necessary service"" by helping battle-stressed soldiers relax and thereby maintain discipline in the ranks. He also revealed that he advised top brass in the U.S. military that American soldiers stationed in Okinawa should visit local sex shops more often as a way to reduce sex crimes. In his view, the ban on U.S. personnel visiting adult entertainment facilities discriminates against women legally working in the business. Hashimoto's remarks portray the comfort women system as a necessary evil, flouting the contrition expressed in the 1993 Kono Declaration. Perhaps he hopes to revive the flagging fortunes of his Japan Restoration Party? Co-leader Shintaro Ishihara, the main instigator in provoking Beijing over the Senkaku/Diaoyu dispute, defended Hashimoto's controversial comments. When they launched their party in 2012 it generated a big buzz, winning 57 seats in the Diet, but recent polls suggest tepid voter interest. It's not immediately clear which constituency Hashimoto is targeting with his recent outbursts since the LDP has a lock on jingoists. His remarks will also not appeal to women voters who have largely shunned the party. Nearly 68 years after surrender, some Japanese conservatives are engaged in counterproductive battles over history that make Japan appear weak and undignified, unable to take the measure of its history. This is not about convincing the world about Japan's innocence. This is a longstanding internecine battle that has animated post-WWII Japanese politics, one that has already been lost in the court of domestic public opinion and in the research conducted by Japan's professional historians. Japan's recalcitrant conservatives are playing with fire and surely Abe recalls that when he was hounded from office in 2007 the denouement began when he tried to revise history. Perhaps stoking tensions abroad is his agenda as he rallies domestic support for remaking Japan by revising its pacifist Constitution. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Kingston.","Recent comments from a nationalist politician suggested WWII sex slaves were necessary .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The ""terrible"" weekend killings of civilians won't knock the United States and its NATO allies off the course they've charted in Afghanistan, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Monday. An American sergeant is suspected of killing 16 people: nine Afghan children, three women and four men in two villages near his combat outpost on Sunday. Gen. John Allen, the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, called the rampage ""the actions of a single soldier,"" but it has added new strains to the relationship between the coalition and the Afghan people in the decade-old war. As he set out for a trip to the Middle East, Panetta told reporters the allies ""seem to get tested almost every other day."" But he added, ""It is important that, all of us, United States, Afghanistan, the ISAF forces all stick to the strategy that we've laid out."" ""War is hell,"" he said. ""These kind of events and incidents are going to take place. They've taken place in any war. They're terrible events. This is not the first of those events, and they probably won't be the last."" Sunday's killings followed a string of incidents involving U.S. troops that have strained ties between the United States and Afghanistan, and Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the weekend bloodshed as ""unforgivable."" Afghanistan's parliament demanded a public trial for the suspect, while the Afghan Taliban condemned U.S. troops as ""sick-minded American savages"" and vowed to exact revenge. ""This is a very negative act in relations between the Afghans and the Americans,"" said a tribal elder in the district of Panjwai, where the killings took place. ""All Afghans have been hurt by this act and I don't think people will trust the Americans anymore,"" said the official, who asked not to be named out of fears for his safety. But Allen told CNN's ""The Situation Room"" that the decade-old allied campaign in Afghanistan ""remains on track"" despite the violence. ""Every single day, Afghan soldiers and Afghan police and ISAF troops are serving shoulder-to-shoulder in some very difficult situations,"" he said. ""And our engagement with them, our shoulder-to-shoulder relationship with them, our conduct of operations with them every single day defines the real relationship. This is an isolated act."" The still-unidentified suspect served three tours of duty in Iraq before being deployed to Afghanistan, Allen said. A U.S. military official, who asked not to be named because he was talking about an ongoing investigation, said the suspect is an Army staff sergeant who arrived in Afghanistan in January. ""The evidence at this point, both in terms of observations and reports and interviews, leads us to believe that he acted as an individual at this point,"" Allen said. During the suspect's last deployment, in 2010, he was riding in a vehicle that rolled over in a wreck, according to a senior Department of Defense official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. The sergeant was diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury after the wreck, but was found fit for duty after treatment, the official said. Allen said the suspect's medical history would be part of the investigation, which would be handled by American military authorities. ""We will certainly keep the Afghan government informed throughout this investigation,"" he said. ""We will keep the Afghan government informed throughout the process of adjudicating the outcome. But this individual will be investigated and the outcome will be in accordance with U.S. law."" White House response to shooting spree . The suspect is in his mid-30s, with a wife and children, officials said Monday. The senior defense official said he is an infantry sniper trained to fire fatal shots from up to 800 meters (yards) away, and was assigned to an outpost near the southern Afghan city of Kandahar to support a Special Forces unit, according to a second military official who asked not to be named because of the investigation. After the predawn shootings Sunday, Panetta said the suspect ""basically turned himself in and told individuals what had happened."" But the senior defense official said the suspect has invoked his right to remain silent and has given no indication of his motive. A congressional source not authorized to speak publicly identified his unit as the 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division, stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington. The source said the soldier was put in pretrial confinement in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the outpost where he was stationed, while the senior defense official said the suspect's family has been moved on to Joint Base Lewis-McChord for their safety. Allen said an Afghan soldier at the outpost spotted the suspect going out around 3 a.m. Sunday and notified American commanders. ""A search party was being put together immediately,"" he said. ""There was a head count done amongst the American soldiers, recognized that he was missing, unaccounted for. We put together a search party right away and it was as that search party was forming that we began to have indications of the outcome of his departure."" The killings could intensify the rage that sparked deadly riots directed at international forces last month over the burning of Qurans by U.S. troops. In addition, U.S. commanders were forced to condemn a video of a squad of Marines urinating on bodies in January, and several soldiers -- also from Joint Base Lewis-McChord -- were charged with taking part in a rogue ""kill squad,"" with the highest-ranking soldier being sentenced to life in prison in November. Taliban link attack to Quran burning . The latest incident brought a new round of high-level statements from Washington. ""This is not who we are, and the United States is committed to seeing that those responsible are held accountable,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday. On Sunday, President Barack Obama phoned Karzai to offer his condolences, assuring his Afghan counterpart that justice would be done. According to the White House, Obama said the attack ""does not represent the exceptional character of our military and the respect that the United States has for the people of Afghanistan."" But villager Muhammad Wali said many of his neighbors have lost confidence in both the Americans and the Afghan security forces, whom they accuse of failing to protect them, he said. ""The people in these villages are scared, and we don't know what is going to happen next,"" Wali said. ""They saw nothing except the Americans going and killing them in their homes,"" he added. Kandahar and the surrounding region is the home of the Taliban, and eight of the 69 coalition troops killed in Afghanistan so far this year died in the province. Officials within the Obama administration said the incident will not derail talks on the role of U.S. troops beyond 2014, when foreign combat troops are scheduled to withdraw. The United States and its allies invaded Afghanistan in 2001, after al Qaeda's attacks on New York and Washington that killed nearly 3,000 people. The invasion quickly toppled the Taliban, an Islamic fundamentalist movement that ruled most of Afghanistan and had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory. But the militia soon regrouped and launched an insurgent campaign against the allied forces and a new government led by Karzai. The No. 1 U.S. target in the conflict, al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden, was killed in a commando raid in neighboring Pakistan in May 2011. American and allied combat troops are scheduled to leave Afghanistan by 2014, and Karzai has been increasingly critical of the allied force. Tensions ramped up dramatically in February after a group of U.S. soldiers burned copies of the Quran, Islam's holy book, that had been seized from inmates at the American-run prison at Bagram Air Base because they allegedly contained extremist communications. CNN's Sara Sidner, John Dear, Jethro Mullen, Barbara Starr, Chris Lawrence, Brianna Keilar, Diana Magnay, Deirdre Walsh and journalist Ruhullah Khapalwak contributed to this report.","NEW: ""War is hell,"" Panetta says, but killings won't affect strategy .

"(CNN) -- Who hasn't left a strange airport wondering not just whether you should be in this taxi but whether it even is one -- only to be charmed, amused or unexpectedly edified by the person behind the wheel. Or, it's true, bored to death, humiliated or even ripped off. Now an online booking service called Airporttransfers has released a survey of 2,162 recent British vacationers, asking them to name the meanest, nastiest, take-the-longest-route-and-still-expect-a-tip taxi drivers on the planet. Travel shocker! British tourists consider French cabbies rude . And get outta ze cab! It's the French. But -- and here we perform some fabulously expressive gesticulation whose meaning is ""leave my hired vehicle immediately"" -- it's also the Italians. That's right: the two European nations have drawn up level at the traffic lights and been judged equally rude. But for every offensive action, there's an equal and opposite reaction -- which brings us to Greece. Some of its taxi drivers, those on the island of Rhodes, were judged among the friendliest on the planet. The news comes on the heels of findings that people on another Greek isle, Ikaria, are among those with the longest life expectancy on Earth. Diet has a lot to do with it, but so, too, does a famously laid-back attitude -- something that might have infected the Rhodes cabbies. But what about those British vacationers? Could it be that their collective offense-taking at the cab driving Jean-Pierres and Patrizias of this world comes from the famous reluctance of the French and Italians to speak English just because the British do? Rides worldwide . To broaden the field a bit, what do non-Brits think of cab drivers worldwide? Asking around our well traveled staff produced some passionate responses. Tokyo cabbies wear suits, white gloves and put doilies and plastic covers on all upholstery. Nice. But they're easily inflamed. ""Don't touch the door!"" warns one editor. ""That's for the driver to operate in your first moment of ultra-impressive service."" ""Hong Kong taxi drivers can be mean and whiny if you're not going far or stuck in a lucrative traffic jam,"" says associate producer (and local) Maggie Wong. ""And, as second-jobbing small businessmen, they all have multiple mobile phones on the dash, so forget about small talk."" World's best taxis . Top storytellers . Next to London's beetle-shaped black cruisers, New York yellow cabs must be the most recognizable in the world. You'd expect New York cabbies to be sassy -- but rude? ""Are you rude to them?"" parries Payal Dixit, an Upper West Side NYC resident in her early thirties. ""I've found that New York cab drivers are some of the best storytellers -- a simple 'hello' can get them going. ""Some don't want to be bothered, but most enjoy sharing their adventures, whether it be about celebrity passengers or their lives in a foreign country you dream of visiting."" View from the front . Dixit raises a good point. What's the view from the front seat? ""You know, 99% of people are as nice as pie,"" says Steve McNamara, general secretary of the British Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association, himself behind the wheel of a London cab for 30 years. (Another, global survey, it should be said, has consistently rated London's legendary black taxis the best in the world.) ""Cab driving restores your faith in humanity. It can be trying when people say, 'I'm staying at the hotel with the green door.' Don't you know there are 8,000 hotels in London? ""And you get obnoxious people who've been drinking -- but that's not as common as you might think. ""The 1% -- the loonies -- can be right wing, left wing, Christian or Muslim.

"Washington (CNN) -- Once again, a swelling chorus is calling on Germany to finally take action. ""Start the engines, Angela,"" reads the colorful headline of a piece whose authors seem to assume that Chancellor Merkel commands the horsepower to save the euro, save the British and American recoveries, and -- as a throw-in -- save the Obama presidency. If only the Germans showed more leadership and found it in them to roll out ""decisive policies,"" argues Harvard historian Charles Maier, the everlasting eurocrisis could be ended. It is true that Germany is the pivot in the euro game. Nothing happens if Germany does not consent. But the reverse is not true. If Germany wants something, it does not necessarily happen. That's where the problem of German leadership starts. While much of the world looks at Germany as an ascending economic power within a declining continent, thereby shifting the regional balance of power in its favor, Germans themselves (and certainly their current elected leader) are keenly aware of the limits of German power. History has taught them painful lessons. Since Germany's emergence as an industrial economy, it has been too big to be one of many in Europe and too small to dominate the continent. The latter proposition has been tested time and again and has usually ended in blood and tears somewhere in Russia. Among Germans, this experience has produced an ingrained skepticism toward the notion of German dominance, even if it comes in the form of a benevolent hegemony, based on the consent of the neighbors and transfer of wealth to them. Germans will be quick to point out that Germany is too small to take much of the rest of Europe onto its back. The German economy accounts for only 27% of the eurozone's output. The debt-to-GDP ratio hovers around an unhealthy 80% and might jump to around 100% given the commitments and guarantees to other European nations. Nobody in Germany has forgotten the enormity of the task to bail out, reform and integrate East Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall. To this very day, 3% to 4% of GDP are spent on transfers to the former East. In 1989, East Germany accounted for roughly a fourth of the population of West Germany and no more than a fraction of its economic output. Compare that to ailing Spain and Italy, whose combined economies rival Germany's today. Therefore, it is a fantasy to assume that Germany alone can be Europe's white knight. Given these constraints, Merkel's willingness to lead Europe is remarkable. She has found a strategy to leverage Germany's limited power. First, Merkel internationalized the European bailouts; second, she broke down the effort into small steps to make them palatable to domestic constituencies in multiple countries; third, she resurrected the French-German alliance as an engine for progress; and, most importantly, she made the markets her friend and ally. In her assessment, no reform will happen in southern Europe without pressure from the markets. And there will be no pressure from the markets without limits to German largesse. Unlimited and unconditional help would take away any incentive to reform. That is the reality in a monetary union without political union because the sovereign who bails out is different from the sovereign who reforms. Merkel's strategy is paying initial dividends. Structural reforms in southern Europe are well under way. But Merkel's leadership has come at a price. Aligning herself with the markets has meant maintaining relentless pressure on the southern countries while keeping the crisis simmering. That has resulted in costly and dangerous brinkmanship and created the myth that the pain of structural adjustment has to be borne by the southern Europeans alone. And it has created a diplomatic challenge. Even Germany's best friends don't understand why the country opens its purse only at the last moment, but not a second earlier. They mistake strategy for passivity and a realistic assessment of Germany's wealth and power for stingy disciplinarianism. With the crisis coming to a head, the German approach will be put to the ultimate test. The markets seem to have concluded that no bazooka will end this crisis alone. They now bet on a so-called banking union as a first step toward centralizing power in Brussels. They seem to regard this form of minimal federalism as solution to the crisis. Merkel endorses core-federalism, at least in principle, but she certainly cannot deliver it alone. Germany may be a reluctant leader, but its followers are even more reluctant. Merkel needs to persuade France, the most sovereignist country in continental Europe, to trade its Gaullist vision of Europe for a more centralized version with some sovereignty moving from Paris to Brussels. She needs to reassure smaller nations that core-federalism is not the equivalent of neo-colonialism. She needs to convince the southern periphery that joint debt and joint risk in Europe will mean joint control over the budget process, thereby limiting the reach of the nation state. And, finally, she needs to win over the Brits to play along with (rather than obstruct) a more centralized system of governance among the eurozone and even the EU countries that the Brits themselves likely will never join. Rather than being made the villain, Merkel could use a little help from her friends across the Atlantic. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff.","Many are callling on Germany to lead effort to rescue the Euro .

"(CNN) -- A cease-fire announced between Islamist rebels in the Philippines and the country's army has not taken hold, and fighting between the two sides continues, a military commander said Saturday. At least 52 people have died since battles ensued six days ago, Lt. Col. Ramon Zagala said. Philippine state media reported that the truce was to go into effect at midnight Saturday, but army officers in the battle zone received no orders for a cease-fire, said Zagala from the frontlines in Zamboanga City. Rebels from the Moro National Liberation Front are continuing their offensive against government forces, he said. ""We are left with no choice but to press on."" Days of unrest . The unrest has fueled fears of increased instability in a region where the central government is pursuing a new peace plan after decades of violence. The crisis in Zamboanga City began when large numbers of rebels from the Muslim militant group came ashore at the start of the week. The outbreaks of violence have killed 11 rebels, five members of the security forces and two civilians, Brig. Gen. Domingo Tutaan, a spokesman for the Philippine military said Friday. Dozens of others have been wounded, he said. Authorities estimated about 180 rebels are holding roughly 170 hostages in six districts. Security forces blockaded affected areas, and the two sides have sporadically exchanged gunfire over the past five days. Speaking Friday at the Armed Forces of the Philippines' headquarters in Zamboanga City, President Benigno Aquino III warned rebel hostage-takers that they face the use of force if they further threaten civilians. ""There are limits, if there is an increased threat to the safety to innocent civilians,"" Aquino said. ""There are lines that they cannot cross. If they cross those lines, we will be obligated to use the state's force against them."" Some hostages have managed to escape, and about 20 rebels have been detained, authorities said. Thousands of people have been evacuated from the rebel-held districts in Zamboanga, a city of about 800,000 on the southwestern tip of the island of Mindanao. Separatist movements . The MNLF, a separatist movement founded in 1971 by Nur Misuari with the aim of establishing an autonomous region for Muslims in the mainly Catholic Philippines, signed a peace deal with the central government in Manila in 1996. But some of its members have broken away to continue a violent campaign. Last month, Misuari issued a ""declaration of independence"" for the Moro nation -- referring to Mindanao's indigenous Muslim population -- after complaining that the MNLF had been left out of a recent wealth-sharing agreement with another insurgent group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which has fought for decades to set up an independent Islamic state on resource-rich Mindanao. Under the agreement signed this year, Muslims will get a 75% share of income derived from the exploitation of metallic minerals in the area -- reported to include gold and copper. Aquino wants to achieve a lasting peace in the region by 2016, when his term ends. Agreements have yet to be reached on power-sharing and normalization, which means giving up arms. A report published last year by the International Crisis Group warned that the peace process needed to find ways to support insurgents as they build normal, civilian lives. CNN's TIm Schwarz and Peter Shadbolt contributed to this report.","Cease-fire previously announced does not take hold .
At least 52 have died in a week of fighting .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's decision to take executive action on immigration won praise from the religious community Sunday, when a leader of the U.S. Catholic Church endorsed the move. ""The bishops of the United States -- we're very much in favor of action being taken to protect people who need to come out of the shadows,"" newly appointed Archbishop of Chicago, Blase Cupich, said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""It's been too long of a time for people to wait for comprehensive immigration reform,"" he continued. ""And so we see this as an important first step hopefully to jump start what's happening."" Cupich, the ninth Archbishop of Chicago, is Pope Francis' first American appointed archbishop. His position generally reflects what the U.S. Council of Catholic Bishops have called for in the past: a path to citizenship and government autonomy over the law enforcement process at the border. Over the past week, Republicans have been quick to slam the President for taking unilateral action, with some going as far as comparing him to a monarch or an emperor. On Sunday, Cupich said it's important for the President to compromise with Congress -- including the Republican-led House which has stalled on an immigration bill for the past 15 months. ""I think it's very important that this be done very carefully but we applaud it as good first step,"" Cupich said. ""More needs to be done. We encourage the President and members of Congress to get this work done."" Cupich also admitted that he has some privacy concerns for illegal immigrants, should Obama's policy be overturned by a Republican president in the future. ""My concern would be that we would have a policy and procedure that would have a confidentiality provision because if people come out of the shadows and sign up and give their names and information, they want to make sure that that is going to be protected in the future should the executive order change by another administration,"" Cupich said. According to Cupich, who served as the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Spokane from 2010 until recently, amnesty is not just a priority of Obama's, but also God's. ""The aspirations that people have for better life for their children -- in which they are reaching out in hope, as many people who have come to this country have -- those aspirations were placed in their heart by God. We have to attend to that,"" Cupich said. ""This is not something that they're wanting on their own but God has always called us to a better life, has always called us to experiencing how we can provide for our families in a better way,"" he continued. ""I think that being the grandson of immigrants I feel that very deeply.""","Blase Cupich, newly appointed Archbishop of Chicago, praised President Obama's immigration action .

"(CNN) -- Daniel Libeskind, the Polish-American architect responsible for the World Trade Center site's redevelopment, says his favorite building is the Military History Museum in Dresden, Germany. Originally an armory for Kaiser Wilhelm I and subsequently under Nazi and Soviet control, the Bundeswehr's main military museum survived the 1945 bombing of Dresden due to its location on the city's outskirts. ""It is an interesting project for me,"" says Libeskind, ""because now it is a museum of modern democratic Germany. How to transform it? How to create a new sense of what it means to have a military in a democracy which is controlled by the citizens?"" In Libeskind's $85 million redesign, completed in 2011, a huge wedge of concrete and steel scythes through the stone, columned building, to create something he describes as ""both disruptive of the old, but [that] also gives you a sense of how we have changed our thinking."" Watch Great Buildings on CNN's Connect the World . Born in Poland, raised under Communist regimes and the child of Holocaust survivors, Libeskind says the concept underpinning his design ""wasn't something that I had to research in libraries."" The dramatic shard, which was constructed as the building was also being restored, helps to reorient the museum's purpose. Libeskind says the new space offers visitors a chance to question ""why people participate in and organize violence, why they conform to totalitarian thoughts."" View a hi-res gallery of Libekind's 'Great Buildings' ""This space is not for weapons. It's to navigate between the horizontal world of history and the vertical world of human aspiration and understanding."" ""I wanted people to feel that sense of displacement, that space of catastrophe,"" he says. ""It's not just about weapons and rockets and tanks, it's about people's decisions, and how people view the world."" The building Libeskind most wishes he'd designed is one completely at odds with its surrounds -- the Eiffel Tower, which looms over Paris' uniformly mid-rise cityscape. ""It's a building with no function, that has no program,"" Libeskind says. ""It's completely uncharacteristic of Paris, and yet it's such a fantastic building. Today it's one of the world's most recognizable and most-visited monuments but in its day, the tower, erected for the 1889 World's Fair, was a controversial emblem of industrialization. Libeskind admires the daring of its design, which was innovative for its time, and the risks its engineers took -- ""the technology had never really been used. There is no guarantee how it would work,"" he notes -- but he also admires its poetry. ""It doesn't mimic anything. It's original. It has a spirit to it, a spirit of the unknown. And when you go see it, you still wonder, what the hell is this thing? How was it built?"" ""That defines for me what good architecture is: It's not a formula. It's not the pretty facade of the building. It's how the building transforms the city. It's changed how people view Paris."" ""All the great artists, composers and politicians hated that building. They wanted to tear it down. They thought it was the ugliest, stupidest thing. But, in the long run, it became the most beloved and most symbolic building of France, of Paris, of Europe."" Libeskind's Dresden museum was also criticized but, he says, he never doubted it. ""Once you hit on the right idea, it's not a matter of compromising. Of course, you have to be flexible to work it out, but the big idea has to be so strong, it has to go through fire and still emerge exactly how you wanted it to be."" ""If people enjoy it, the building becomes part of the city, and then people have a different idea of the city. It can have a big role in changing what the world looks like to us.""","Daniel Libeskind's redesign of the Military History Museum in Dresden is his favorite work to date .

"(CNN) -- The human imagination is an amazing thing. Take for example the story of how a simple father-and-son chat led to a prototype spacecraft for landing on other planets. One Friday evening in 2009, NASA engineer Stephen Altemus arrived home from work feeling, well, kind of frustrated. Altemus, who was chief engineer at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, believed the agency was under ""incredible pressure and scrutiny"" for allegedly high budget costs. NASA's ambitious Constellation program to develop a next-generation rocket was about to be canceled. ""The environment was a sense of uncertainty and chaos and redirection,"" Altemus told CNN last week on the phone. Engineering, he believed, wasn't being used to contribute to NASA's future. ""That responsibility to make sure every dollar is spent exactly right within the agency sometimes causes a stifling of innovation,"" Altemus said. ""What NASA needed was an innovative fire that made it OK to try and fail and learn from mistakes."" Altemus' 15-year-old son noticed something was wrong. "" 'You never talk bad about NASA, Dad,' "" Altemus recalled his son saying. The conversation that followed, the engineer said, was a ""moment of inspiration -- instigated by my son."" They sat down at the family dinner table and talked about how to ""put NASA back on the map with a bold mission that seemed nearly impossible."" A short time later, Altemus created a few charts and his son put together an illustrative YouTube video. Monday morning at his office, Altemus made his pitch to his NASA leadership team. ""I said, 'What if we unleashed the power of engineering, and did things our way, and were not deterred? What could we do together?' "" It was a radical idea: Build an unmanned spacecraft with a robotic explorer and send it to the moon within 1,000 days. Its engines would be powered by liquid oxygen and methane fuel. The vehicle would also have a self-guided laser landing system that avoided coming down on big boulders and other hazards. Altemus' fellow team members said, ""Yes."" They were in. Altemus then took his crusade to a higher level, briefing officials at NASA headquarters. ""We told them, 'We've got an idea that's going to change the agency.' They were like: 'Yeah, yeah, this is really good but politically this may not fly.' "" Nonetheless, Project M was born. ""We had no money we had no endorsement from leadership, we had no authority to proceed, we had nothing. All we had was this commitment to do engineering in a lean, affordable way."" Despite a shoestring budget, Altemus' team cobbled together the parts and technology they needed. They bartered. They traded. At first, ""a whole lot of political fallout came trying to squash the project,"" Altemus said. Nonetheless, Project M gained momentum. ""It was nothing like what NASA was used to."" Eventually, ""the whole attitude changed."" By June 2010, Project M ended without making it to the moon. But it resulted in an offshoot project called the Morpheus planetary lander. An unmanned spacecraft that can haul 1,100 pounds of cargo, Morpheus looks like a four-legged metallic spider on steroids. Given what this thing can do without risking human lives, the four-year program was a steal at $14 million. Compare that to the approximate $1.7 billion cost of one space shuttle. That's billion, with a ""B."" Mainly Morpheus serves as a testing platform for new technologies that could take both unmanned and manned spacecraft to other worlds. It's the first NASA prototype spacecraft to be propelled using liquid oxygen and liquid methane. It's also the first to use a suite of laser-based sensors as a kind of autopilot for dangerous landing situations. ""The technologies demonstrated on Morpheus are directly applicable to future robotic, and eventually human missions,"" Morpheus Project Manager Jon Olansen told CNN via e-mail. That includes landing on asteroids, the moon, Mars, or even Jupiter's moon, Europa. U.S. President Barack Obama has called for astronauts to orbit Mars by the mid-2030s. But its development wasn't exactly smooth sailing. In 2012, during an engine test of a Morpheus prototype, the lander rose a short distance, rolled over and slammed into the ground. It caught fire immediately and exploded about 30 seconds later. Thankfully there were no injuries, but the crash ""was a huge setback for the team,"" Altemus said. NASA quickly ""picked itself up"" and figured out how to fix the problem. Read more about the crash . Today, the latest version of the Morpheus lander ""is a centerpiece for the agency to show what a fantastic team it is, and what incredible things can be done with just sheer willpower to imagine,"" said Altemus, who in 2013 ended a 25-year career at NASA to start an engineering products business based on space technology. The sophisticated self-guided system that prevents Morpheus from setting down in hazardous landing zones could be used on a lander that could safely put astronauts on another planet. The auto-pilot could greatly reduce astronaut workload during the critical phase of a manned mission, Olansen said. It opens up areas for exploration that were once considered too dangerous even for robotic landings -- like the north and south poles of the moon, which are riddled with craters. In fact, during the next decade, NASA plans an unprecedented mission to send astronauts to an asteroid. Accomplishing that feat would be historic. Training has already begun. On May 9, two astronauts performed a simulated asteroid space walk at the Houston facility's 40-foot-deep low-gravity simulation pool. They practiced on a mockup of an Orion, NASA's manned spacecraft which is still being developed. Read more about the asteroid mission . Amazingly, NASA planners hope to design a robot spacecraft that would capture an asteroid and haul it into a stable orbit near the moon. Next, astronauts aboard an Orion would spacewalk to the asteroid and collect rock samples that would help scientists learn more about the components of asteroids. It's possible that Morpheus' fuel -- liquid oxygen and methane -- could be found on Mars or other planets. This opens the door to the idea that a Morpheus-like lander could refuel there. Here's how it might work: An unmanned fuel-making spacecraft would travel to Mars ahead of the lander. The fuel-making spacecraft would then harvest methane from the atmosphere, said Altemus. ""If there's water in the soil you would harvest the water and break down the water into oxygen and hydrogen. Then the lander sets down near the fuel-making spacecraft and uses the oxygen and methane to refuel for another flight. How amazing would it be if that father-son talk across a Houston dinner table back in 2009 had even the smallest connection to a journey to another world? Human space exploration is ""part of our DNA,"" said Altemus. ""It's as simple as that. We as human beings will find a way to strive to create, to invent. As long as there are planets in the sky that are unreachable, somebody's going to try to reach them.""","Ideas for NASA's unmanned Morpheus spacecraft started with a father-son talk .

It's fueled by liquid oxygen and methane, which can be found on other planets .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The crash of a Turkish airliner in the Netherlands and the recent landing of a jet in the Hudson River in New York demonstrate how safe modern aircraft have become, according to safety experts. Emergency services help to evacuate passengers after Turkish Airlines plane crashes in Amsterdam. The Boeing 737-800, which originated from Istanbul, Turkey, was trying to land at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol when it went down. At least nine people were killed in the crash and 50 injured, 25 of them seriously, the airport's director said Wednesday. The plane was carrying 127 passengers and seven crew members. Pictures from the scene showed the plane broken in three pieces. One tear was in front of the wing, splitting the ""Turkish"" logo in two, and a larger tear was farther back along the fuselage. Most of the injured were seated toward the back of the plane, which sustained the most damage, a passenger on the plane told Turkish station NTV. Many of the passengers simply walked off the plane through the cracks in the fuselage, witnesses told NTV. See where the plane crashed . Kieran Daly, of the online aviation news service Air Transport Intelligence, said it was clear from the New York and Amsterdam crashes that many accidents are now survivable. Daly said that in many previous crashes, fatalities were caused by fire. But in the 1980s many new laws came in, especially in the United States, that brought about vast improvements in the materials used to build aircraft, meaning they did not burn as easily.  Watch as air expert discusses safety » . The pictures from the Amsterdam crash indicated there had not been a widespread fire, Daly said. He said the impact had been severe but it could have been survivable because of the lack of fire. He said there was ""precious little"" in common between the two accidents unless the Amsterdam incident was also caused by a bird strike. But the low number of casualties in both crashes was testament to technical advances made by the aviation industry. The Turkish Airlines Boeing 737-800 that crashed in Amsterdam was built in 2003 and was inspected last year, Daly said. ""They really are pretty much state-of-the-art airliners with every imaginable technical benefit the industry has come up with over the years,"" Daly told CNN. ""It is a tribute to Boeing and Airbus that their aircraft are so safe. Most accidents now are caused by single causes, like bird strikes, that you simply can't legislate against."" ""You would be optimistic that they would be quite survivable in an accident."" Daly said the Turkish aviation industry has a ""pretty good record"" of safety, and that Turkish Airlines, the national carrier, has a ""very good record."" The airline's last accident was of a small commuter jet in 2003, he said. It was a fatal crash that happened at a remote airfield in eastern Turkey, he said. ""Their mainline operation is safe,"" Daly said. ""Their pilots are well thought of."" The last accident at Schiphol Airport happened in December 2003 when an EasyJet flight carrying 103 passengers to London collided with a lamppost while taxiing during icy conditions, according to Aviation Safety Network's Web site. The crash caused significant damage to the aircraft, but no one was killed. The other two most recent accidents at Schiphol -- in 1998 and 1997 -- also resulted in no fatalities, according to the network. The last fatal incident at the Amsterdam airport happened in April 1994 when a KLM aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff as it tried to return to Schiphol. Three of the 24 passengers and crew members on board were killed. Another airline expert, Philip Butterworth-Hayes, said the safety of the Boeing 737 along with the five runways of Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam and its advanced safety systems would have helped as the pilot tried to land the plane. ""The 737 is an extraordinarily robust aircraft,"" said Butterworth-Hayes, editor of Air Traffic Management Insight. Both the New York and the Amsterdam crashes involved a major impact but the aircrafts' fuselages were not scattered around a large area, showing how strong these planes are, he said. iReport.com: Watch video at scene of crash . Stressing that it was too soon to speculate about the cause of Wednesday's crash, he said the pilot appeared to have control of the plane a long way down its approach to the airport. It landed close to a remote runway at the airport, and its five runways would give flight controllers more options in bringing down a plane that was in trouble. CNN's Richard Quest said on older aircraft the seats would have come apart  ""but in this case the seats and their belts saved them.""","Experts: Amsterdam crash shows how safe modern aircraft have become .

"(CNN) -- Jim Marshall was always watching. His contemporaries remember him forever on the spot, four or five cameras draped around his neck, the proverbial fly on the wall. A new book, ""The Haight: Love, Rock and Revolution,"" shows how he chronicled an era. Click: Janis Joplin. Click: Jimi Hendrix at Monterey. Click, click, click: The Beatles at Candlestick Park, the Grateful Dead on a rooftop, the Jefferson Airplane casually jamming. Marshall is justifiably famous for these photos of the famous. But it wasn't like he put away his cameras when the rock stars -- then, for the most part, just getting more widely known -- put away their instruments. ""The Haight"" showcases pictures Marshall took from about 1965 to 1968, when Haight-Ashbury went from a quietly run-down fringe area to the most famous neighborhood in America: Hippie Central. For Marshall, it was also home. ""He lived in the Haight. He was at ground zero,"" says Amelia Davis, Marshall's longtime assistant, who now oversees the estate of the late photographer. (Marshall died in 2010.) ""So much happened in a short period of time, and Jim saw that."" The book's earlier images show a neighborhood on the verge of change. In 1965, Haight-Ashbury was a mixed-race enclave of cheap apartments and old Victorian houses, home to working-class laborers and Beat artists looking for inexpensive digs. The countercultural bent started early: In one photo, residents are shown protesting the Vietnam War at a time when the war was barely a blip on the national radar. Suddenly the music scene took over, exemplified by the Airplane, the Dead, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Quicksilver Messenger Service and the Charlatans. The Charlatans, who dressed as Edwardian swells, were probably the most deliberately colorful, but it was the other bands who became the legends. Marshall's eye was able to find the energy in musicians without being sentimental. The Beatles, shot at their last American concert, are caught backstage, pensive and bored; in one photo, Paul McCartney doodles on a table while Joan Baez smiles into Marshall's lens. In others, Joplin comes across as innocent and ferocious -- and, sometimes, heartbreakingly sad. Marshall is no less unsparing when shooting the neighborhood, which became a destination for tourists and dropouts. One photo shows a family of six driving through, their car windows safely rolled up as if in protection against long hair. Another shows an inoculation being given at the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic. As Quicksilver's David Freiberg says in the book, ""I had about two weeks that were really happy. After that, it faded pretty quickly. ... The drugs changed. The Gray Line (tour buses were) going up the street."" Marshall got such access because he was a part of the scene. He didn't just take the Beatles' picture; he hung out with them. He went to Monterey, the groundbreaking 1967 music festival, because he was pals with many of the acts. ""A lot of the musicians really knew that Jim wasn't taking advantage of them. He was there documenting what was happening, and that's why he was able to get such great shots,"" says Davis. Amazingly, Marshall's photographs were done on manually operated Leicas -- no autofocus, no special lighting, certainly no Photoshop. ""He was able to compose that shot, in a second, within that viewfinder, and he never cropped his photos,"" Davis says. ""That just tells you his genius."" These days, when the Haight has become a gentrified stretch of expensive apartments and exclusive boutiques, Marshall's photographs are even more striking. They show bands on the rise, streets in flux, a time being born -- and, just as quickly, fading away. His lens, ""The Haight"" shows, missed little. ""He was everywhere,"" says Davis.","Photographer Jim Marshall chronicled Haight-Ashbury in the '60s .

"(CNN) -- Uber, the ride-sharing service, is once again in the spotlight for a PR nightmare of its own making. Stunningly, executive Emil Michael suggested -- in what may have been off-the-record comments -- that the company might not be above threatening journalists who criticize Uber. In the past, Uber supporters have offered excuses for the company's blunders, saying that its speed of growth creates stress and contributes to mistakes. Uber seems to make many mistakes. Tracking a journalist's whereabouts with an app called ""God View,"" or conflating the Uber on-demand car service with a fictitious on-demand service trolling for women that CEO Travis Kalanick calls ""Boob-er,"" are not good ideas. But the story is more important than PR gaffes and immature jokes. Uber is the latest example in a long line of organizations and professional cultures guided by corporate narcissism. Such companies are so consumed with preening and filling their coffers that they lose sight of their customers. When taken to an extreme, corporate narcissism can put customers at risk. They can even be physically hurt and have their lives turned upside down in disastrous ways. Consider the number of people whose lives were shattered in the 2007 mortgage crisis. Led by a notoriously narcissistic company, Countrywide Financial, the rapacious mortgage and banking industry zeroed in on new profits from record numbers of mortgages by giving unqualified borrowers loans. Who cared if folks couldn't pay back the money? When the inevitable housing market crash came, countless lives were left in ruins as the roofs over their heads were taken away. The financial meltdown was so epic that we're still recovering from it today. Yet, most of the mortgage and banking institutions involved remained standing despite the big mess. Or consider the NFL. Revelations of NFL players who were hardly punished for domestic violence incidents or charges of drug addiction have become almost commonplace. And what about players who suffer brain damage, depression and dementia, as a result of repeated concussions -- a situation long covered up by the NFL? It seems like the NFL keeps its eye more on league success at the expense of player ethics and safety. Where's the accountability? Or consider Target, whose CEO, Gregg Steinhafel, lost his job earlier this year after presiding over many missteps, including a massive credit card data breach that affected millions of customers. If Target had heeded early warnings from its IT department, maybe this could have been prevented. But the company seemed to have lost its focus, and the protection of customers' privacy didn't garner as much attention. One need look no further than the past few months to see Uber barreling down similarly narcissistic paths. And people are pushing back asking, among other things, if their personal safety is at risk when they get in an Uber car. Can they really trust that this company, with such apparently impulsive and aggressive leadership, will protect them and ensure a positive experience? What companies need is a culture of consumer accountability. But Uber is going in the opposite direction. None of the 8 Uber ""competencies"" that are expected of employees focuses on appealing to customers, much less consumer values like responsibility for passenger safety, privacy, data protection or the right to a rating-free experience after a ride. Uber's privacy policy is vague and not transparent, which could lead to abuses of customer data security, especially in full-steam-ahead cultures where the message is anything goes if it drives scale. The company has yet to address what it will do with the abundant customer data it collects with every ride. But even in the absence of these protections, a company whose CEO thinks of women as ""Boob-ers"" may not be perceived as one that has every consumer's interest at heart. The company may see this moment of blowback as a speed bump on its way to world dominance -- an inconvenience that can be managed by an expert political campaigner, a PR challenge that can be smoothed over through private dinners with media influencers. In reality, Uber is a company at major risk of losing its lead in the market. The app is easily copied and the service it provides erects no barriers to competitive entry. If Uber changes its approach from narcissism to accountability by focusing on consumer relationships and loyalty, it will have a chance at a bright future.","Uber recently was in the spotlight again for a PR nightmare of its own making .

"(CNN) -- Ever hopped in a taxi and sat in traffic for hours whilst pedestrians and cyclists sailed past your window? If so, you may wondered whether you're part of the problem and not the solution. As public transport networks continue to improve in many African cities, taxis remain a common mode of getting around. But for Neil du Preez, there must be a better way. The South African entrepreneur has developed Mellowcabs -- electric three-wheeled vehicles designed for eco-friendly and efficient transportation in urban areas. CNN's African Start-Up caught up with du Preez to talk travel, business and starting up in South Africa. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: What got you thinking about changing the taxi concept? Neil du Preez: The departure point was when I learned 80% of all urban trips are less than four kilometers. Globally, taxi rides are fairly short and it's really inefficient to use a traditional taxi for these journeys. Efficiencies that can come with a small vehicle are enormous and passenger savings would be enormous. CNN: What stage of development is Mellowcabs at? NdP: We built eight prototype cars and did a lot of testing -- we tested brakes, lights, everything. After the test, we basically wanted to re-design the entire vehicle and took the prototypes off the road. We are now at the stage of building chassis and want to be on South African roads in the first quarter of 2015. CNN: You say these vehicles are designed for urban areas. Where are you targeting in South Africa and beyond? NdP: We already have demand from advertisers for 60 vehicles in the Western Cape [The South African province where Cape Town is located]. After that, we will focus on Gauteng province -- South Africa's province where Johannesburg and Pretoria are located. Beyond that a big mobile phone company in Nigeria is interested too and we are considering an initial focus on Lagos. But this could go beyond Africa too. We have had talks about a project in Washington DC and other cities in USA. CNN: How safe will traveling in these vehicles be? NdP: We have developed ultra-rigid roll cage, safety belts and proximity sensors for the vehicles and some will be fitted with doors. I also recognize there are some security issues in South Africa. In very slow moving traffic, there is a risk of bag-snatching. Passengers will be able to use lockable baggage areas underneath the seat to keep property safe. And we are also looking at some vehicles to be fitted with a CCTV camera. CNN: How much will it cost for a normal journey? NdP: The goal is to make each ride 15-20 rand (less than $2) per ride, irrespective of distance traveled. We want a Mellowcab ride to be way, way cheaper than traditional taxis. Normal taxis in South Africa are 8Rand per kilometer in a flagged ride, plus 15 rand for ""flag fall."" I recently took a 15 kilometer taxi ride north of Cape Town, and it cost 370 rand ($33). We want Mellowcab to be much cheaper for the passenger and for the operator too. Passengers will be able to pay cash or through an app. CNN: Will all Mellowcabs be driven by employees, or can people hire them for self-drive? NdP: All drivers will be permanently employed staff -- there's more than enough people looking for quality work around here. I want to build up a team of really strong drivers. We're putting successful drivers through a formal tour-guide training course, which will benefit not only us, but ideally develop them into small business owners later on. We're also equipping them with communication and client interaction courses. What we're also thinking of doing is transferring ownership of the vehicles to the drivers after a period of successful operation ... enabling them to become semi-owner drivers. CNN: Where is the funding coming from? NdP: At the moment, the South African government is not involved. They have promised to get involved in the future, but I'm not sure I want that. At the moment, the funding comes from a South African venture capital fund, and I own the majority of the shares. There is one other investor -- it's [been] almost three years of playing around with different transport ideas. CNN: Why have you decided to start in South Africa -- is it a good country for entrepreneurs? NdP: As far as Africa goes, South Africa is ideal -- we have good infrastructure and good internet connectivity. But we should all start thinking outside of Africa. There's quite a lot of demand outside of South Africa for South African products. Traditionally, there was a very old school mindset -- South Africa was a very isolated market. Now things are happening, a lot of good opportunities and focus on startups. CNN: Is the government doing enough to encourage innovation? NdP: The South African government could get much more involved in developing entrepreneurs. I'd love them to get more involved particularly with funding. There is funding available for entrepreneurs, but it's practically impossible. It's really difficult to access the funding from South African government.

"(CNN) -- On the night the Ferguson Grand jury's decision broke, a friend sent me an email: . ""Something was clearly broken in the Ferguson community long before Michael Brown died. Time and energy needs to be spent on figuring out what went wrong and how you begin again to build trust -- because it will have to be rebuilt."" I agree. Justice to be credible and accepted has to have trust as its foundation. Ferguson does not stand alone. Every day, in cities and towns across America, African-Americans experience weighted scales of justice. This reality is an accepted part of life for too many. That must change. It's also important to realize that having problems based on race does not mean we've backslid. President Obama is right when he says race relations in this nation are improving, and are much better than in years past. We have traveled a long, hard road to a better America. It is an ongoing journey requiring constant vigilance. When I was growing up, our nation was partitioned: Blacks were segregated by law in the South and largely by custom in the North, though it too had segregation laws. Our best universities had quota systems. Many white communities had real estate covenants to keep nonwhites out. Segregationist Gov. George Wallace won Michigan and Maryland -- not just the deep South -- in his bid for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination. It was a crime in the South for blacks and white to sit together on a bus. North and South, it was prohibited for blacks and whites to marry. Despite this wide racial gulf, most Americans showed a deep commitment to fairness. This contrasted and contested sharply with sanctioned -- sometimes officially, sometimes unofficially -- vigilante hangings and bombings, fire hoses, police dogs, and congressional filibusters. As the civil rights struggle progressed, Americans responded to the justice of the cause, shedding layers of the crusty armor that shielded the white majority from contact with its large black minority. There are layers left. It feels so much better to be on good terms with one another. I remember when Sen. John Stennis of Mississippi, a vigorous opponent of civil rights legislation, voted for an extension of the Voting Rights Act in 1983. ""I didn't want to go back to all the days of misunderstanding,"" he said afterward. ""I didn't want to turn around and go back,"" he said. We have gone forward. We also know America isn't Shangri-La. When cities burn in the night, parents weep in silent anguish, thousands march in protest, and a Ferguson prosecutor willingly undercuts his own case, we have a distance to travel. Today, we need a national commission on justice. One that is more than a fact-finding commission. One whose purpose is reconciliation. This one should be modeled after South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, chaired by Bishop Desmond Tutu. There was an emphasis in that commission on reconciliation. There was a marked effort to forgive. Tutu wrote, ""When I talk of forgiveness I mean the belief that you can come out the other side ... a better person than the one being consumed by anger and hatred. ""Remaining in that state locks you in a state of victimhood, making you almost dependent on the perpetrator. If you can find it in yourself to forgive then you are no longer chained to the perpetrator. You can move on."" Bishop Tutu added a ""but."" ""But the process of forgiveness also requires acknowledgment on the part of the perpetrator that they have committed an offense."" The grand jury system, not just in Ferguson, but nationwide, needs a hard look. Millions feel that officers who are trigger-happy are handed a license to shoot -- based not on facts, but on stereotypes the officers carry. Millions feel stereotypes explain why a lone 12-year-old with a toy gun was instantly, and fatally shot in daylight by Cleveland police, but why a white mass-murderer, shooting in a darkened theater, was apprehended unharmed. Citizen grievances must be gathered, studied and addressed. Acknowledgment of wrongdoing, where appropriate, must be made. Changes must come. Forgiveness must follow. But we cannot ignore this problem, or pretend it doesn't exist. I share the pain of the Americans who wrote these tweets: from Joelie @Joeelleeee  ""IF YOU'RE NOT ANGRY, YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION."" And Petty LaBelle @d_Sassy1ne who tweeted, ""My 7 year old son just said: ""Don't worry mom. If we want to live, we just have to stay home"". I'm turning off my tv. My heart just broke."" Let us start by addressing these issues, work together to find ways to rebuild trust between citizens and those who are paid to protect us from violence.","Donna Brazile: After Ferguson decision, trust among black community has to be rebuilt .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Did Oscar Pistorius have time to think before he shot and killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp last year? That's the question that state prosecutor Gerrie Nel dug into Thursday with a doctor who has spent years working with the disabled athlete. ""His intention was to shoot, whoever he came across -- if he came across anyone"" in his home on a February night last year, Nel put to the doctor, Wayne Derman. ""I suppose if he came across an intruder or danger, he would shoot,"" Derman responded. And Pistorius was firing to kill, the prosecutor said. Derman, a defense witness, paused a long time before he finally responded. ""He was aiming to neutralize the threat,"" the doctor said. Nel let those words hang in the air for a long moment before announcing that he was done with his questions for the day. Pistorius, 27, is on trial for murder, and while he admits firing the bullets that killed Steenkamp, he pleaded not guilty. He says he mistakenly thought he was defending himself from an intruder. The prosecution says the two had an argument and he deliberately murdered the model and law school graduate, who was 29. 'Two Oscars' Derman spent all day Thursday on the stand, first testifying under defense questioning that Pistorius' double amputation is key to understanding his behavior. Do not be taken in by the fact that Pistorius is one of the fastest runners in the world -- remember he is disabled, he argued. Derman ran through a long list of the difficulties that double amputees experience every day, concluding: ""The saddest thing I have learned through my six years of working with athletes with disability is that disability never sleeps. ""It's there when you go to sleep at night and it's there when you wake up in the morning. It affects nearly every aspect of your life,"" he said. Pistorius' defense team seems to be trying to establish that he acted reasonably, given who he is, when he killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013. Judge Thokozile Masipa must decide whether he made a genuine mistake and, if so, whether the mistake and his response were reasonable. The South African Olympian's defense team has been exploring his psychology this week. His lawyer Kenny Oldwadge posited Thursday that there were ""two Oscars,"" one of whom was a global sports star and one of whom was ""vulnerable"" and ""scared."" ""I am stuffed without my legs on,"" his lawyer quoted him as saying, using a slang term meaning ""in trouble."" Witness reliability . Prosecutor Nel went after Derman aggressively in his cross-examination, exploring whether the shooting was an instinctive ""fight-or-flight"" response or the result of conscious thought. The question of whether Pistorius is found guilty of premeditated murder could hinge on the answer. Exchanges between the two got testy, with Nel trying to get the doctor to explain Pistorius' actions moment by moment on the night he killed Steenkamp. Derman said it was impossible for him to answer theoretical questions about what Pistorius might have been thinking or doing at a given instant because he, Derman, knew what had actually happened after the moment in question. Frustrated, he appealed to Judge Masipa, but she sided with Nel, firmly instructing the witness to answer his questions or say he didn't know. Nel began his cross-examination by suggesting that Derman was not a trustworthy witness because he had a responsibility to Pistorius as his doctor. Masipa rejected the objection. The prosecutor kept up the attack, demanding to know when Derman had made particular notes on Pistorius, whether the court should believe Derman or Pistorius when their evidence differed, and the meaning of the word ""subsequent."" Derman grew irritated with Nel when the prosecutor responded: ""That's not true"" to a statement Derman gave, and he appealed to the judge that Nel was being ""unprofessional."" Masipa agreed and ordered Nel to withdraw the remark. Nel, in turn, showed annoyance with Derman asking which ""incident"" he was referring to. ""The killing!"" Nel shouted back at him. Suicide risk . The defense has been exploring Pistorius' mental health for several days. On Wednesday, his lead lawyer Barry Roux said Pistorius is depressed, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and is a suicide risk, according to the doctors who spent a month evaluating his mental health. But he does not appear to have a history of abnormal aggression or psychopathic tendencies linked to ""rage-type murders in intimate relations,"" they found. The conclusions are a ""slam-dunk for the defense,"" CNN legal expert Kelly Phelps said. The psychiatric report seemed to suggest that Pistorius' version of events was plausible. ""When Mr. Pistorius's appraisal of the situation is that he might be physically threatened, a fear response follows that might seem extraordinary when viewed from the perspective of a normal bodied person, but normal in the context of a disabled person with his history,"" the doctors found. Several witnesses have testified that Pistorius tends to arm himself and go toward danger, rather than away from it, when he thinks he is under threat. At the trial's conclusion, Judge Masipa will have to decide whether Pistorius, 27, genuinely made a mistake or deliberately murdered his girlfriend. If Masipa does not believe the athlete thought there was an intruder, she will find him guilty of murder and sentence him to a prison term ranging from 15 years to life. South Africa does not have the death penalty. If Masipa accepts that Pistorius did not know that Steenkamp was the person he was shooting at, she could find him guilty of culpable homicide, a lesser charge than murder, or acquit him, according to CNN analyst Phelps. A verdict of culpable homicide would leave the sentence at Masipa's discretion. The trial is scheduled to continue Monday for a 38th day.

"(CNN) -- San Sebastian has what you could call food form. Three restaurants in the town of 200,000 on Spain's northeastern Atlantic coast hold the gastronomic holy grail of three Michelin stars -- only Kyoto has more Michelin-starred eateries per square meter. It's already pretty obvious why global gourmets frequently place it atop their must-eat list. And then you add the pintxos. Pintxos, or spikes in the Basque language that's proudly heard throughout the region, are tapas taken to a whole new level. No sweaty chorizo or clammy calamari on cocktail sticks here. San Sebastian's pintxos bars are culinary tours de force in their own right, delivering dishes that wouldn't look out of place in their Michelin-starred neighbors. The only challenge facing visitors to this gastronomic wonderland is not what, but where, to eat. I took the route of long, slow restaurant lunches, followed by late night hopping between the pintxos bars. Foie gras ice cream . My food quest kicked off with lunch at the venerable institution, Arzak. It's here that 71-year-old Juan-Mari Arzak has held a Michelin star for 40 years and three stars for a quarter of a century. Twenty-five years at the absolute pinnacle of any profession is remarkable, but in the uber-competitive world of fine dining, it's unprecedented. Arzak the restaurant is the story of the Arzak family. Juan-Mari's grandparents built the property as a wine cellar and tavern in 1897, while he started working there in 1966. The unassuming exterior on a suburban street leads into a modernist dining room where the same menu is served at lunch and in the evening. Calling it a meal, however, doesn't really do it justice. It's a culinary joyride of beauty, complexity and even wit. Foie gras is served as an ice cream, featuring caramelized onions and green tea, in an inverted yucca cone dusted with shellfish powder. Fine dining laboratory . A deceptively simple but sublime dish features cubes of potato, egg yolk and white truffle. For an overload of smells, tastes, sights and sounds, grilled lobster with charcoal-roasted zucchini is served on a translucent plate above an iPad playing a video of waves crashing in to shore. Seriously. Arzak's post-dessert petits fours feature a candy shop and workshop mash-up called Ferreteria Arzak, or Arzak Ironmongers, with silver sugar keys, cola bottle tops, chocolate nuts and screws. As would be expected from one of the world's top restaurants, the wine cellar features terrifyingly rare and expensive vintages. A back-of-house look reveals a laboratory where new dishes are created and a room featuring 1,500 different spices. World's most popular tortillas? The Arzak family have defined and owned Michelin-starred cuisine in San Sebastian and cemented the town's reputation. Today that reputation is as much focused on pintxos bars as Michelin stars and, having gradually recovered from an epic lunch, it's time to consider evening options. While it's possible to be led by your eyes into one of scores of pintxos bars, a small group tour is an excellent introduction and allows you to get to know some of the very best dishes and venues. Englishman Jon Warren ditched a career in finance to follow his passion, setting up San Sebastian Food to offer tours of the bars, local producers and vineyards that give the Basque region such an enviable reputation. He explains that the pintxos bars ""are the cool, young siblings to the Michelin stars and offer ultimate flexibility; informal dining, bite-sized portions, low prices and the chance to switch at the turn of a heel from traditional to modern cuisine."" An evening tour led by a donostiarra (a San Sebastian local) takes visitors from one to the next for small bites and pours of local ciders and wines, especially txakoli, a slightly sparkling young white wine. Countless bars, some traditional, others more cutting edge in cuisine and atmosphere, try to outdo one another with heaving displays or specialties. Bar Nestor serves a famous tortilla, but only in limited numbers, at 1 p.m. and 8 p.m. precisely. Turn up 15 minutes late and prepare to leave disappointed. Legendary anchovies . The rare delicacy of percebes or goose barnacles at Goiz Barci are less punctual, but worth spending time on. The boquerones (fresh anchovies) at Txepetxa are legendary. Warren nails pintxos culture when he says it's all about the social context. ""Lining the streets of the old town, everyone is there to have fun, between the barmen, the locals and visitors, creating a lively camaraderie filled with wine, food and chattering."" As if the culinary gods hadn't blessed San Sebastian enough with Michelin stars and pintxos bars, there are also scores of artisanal producers dotted throughout the historic town. The central food market is a treasure trove of local produce, in particular the rightly famous jamon iberico de bellota (ham from acorn-fed pigs). In those brief pauses between eating some of the world's greatest food, it's worth taking a walk on the beautiful beaches or promenade, drinking in the sea air and stunning vistas and dreaming of being a donostiarra.

"(CNN) -- Most of us haven't lived enough to fill one memoir, let alone two, but then again most of us have not lived the life of Anjelica Huston, the Academy Award-winning actress and daughter of late legendary director John Huston. Huston set out to write a book about her life, but it started to become a ""tome"" at 900-plus pages in length, she said with a laugh during a recent interview, so she was advised by her agent to do two books. Her second and newest memoir, aptly titled ""Watch Me,"" begins with her start in Hollywood, and just seven pages in, she gets to the ""juicy"" stuff, she admits, the start of her 17-year-relationship with one of the biggest stars at the time, Jack Nicholson. 'Instantly in love' She was 21 and had just been living in California for about two months, she said, when her stepmother brought her along to a party at Nicholson's house. ""The door of this sort of ranch house opened and there was that smile,"" she said with a smile. ""And, of course, I fell instantly in love."" There were ""lots of up and downs,"" she said, especially because her ""seriously handsome"" companion happened to be one of the most sought-after men in the world. She describes being at the Cannes Film Festival when a beautiful young woman came up and offered Nicholson a ride on her motorbike. ""He'd go, 'Well, why not? That's great. Bye, Toots,' and off he goes,"" said Huston. ""I'd be kind of left in the dust like, 'What happened?' And so I had to negotiate that, and it was extremely hard at first. Then you develop more of a sense of humor about it. ""People also say to me, 'Well, why did you hang on?' Oh, why not, you know. I was in love, and I think maybe in a few cases I took those infidelities more seriously than he did,"" she said. A message for women . Huston, in her memoir, also opens up for the first time about a very troubling time in her life, when she claims her then-boyfriend, actor Ryan O'Neal, physically assaulted her. They were at a party together when O'Neal couldn't find her and abruptly left, she said. She followed him and called after him. ""And he turned around and gave me what the English describe as a 'nutter,' which is when you take somebody's head in your hands and smash it against your own,"" she said. Although O'Neal had a temper, Huston said she doesn't want to ""characterize him as somebody who beats up women. But I don't think it's something that men should get away with."" After that incident, Huston stopped dating O'Neal. She has a message for any woman who finds herself in an abusive relationship. ""Move. Get out. Don't stick around. Any man who lifts a hand against a woman is a coward in my book."" Calls to O'Neal's representative seeking comment were not returned. Huston had plenty more to say in our interview, including her thoughts on the way Oscar night used to be; her first Broadway role, beginning in January, starring in ""Love Letters"" with Martin Sheen; and the continued challenges for women in Hollywood. These highlights of our conversation have been edited for length and clarity. On how Oscar night used to be . ""Nobody wears clothes anymore. ... They're wearing very long brassieres. And I think it's great to look back on old Oscar footage ... and some of the dresses people came up with. ... People made great mistakes. It was a lot of fun. Things have gotten very much more, sort of, conventional."" On aging in Hollywood . ""For me, it's getting better, because I'm able to laugh at it, and I don't take it as seriously as I used to. ... I think we develop a sense of humor about these things that we go through. We can laugh at them. ... You don't have to fret so much about how you look. You look the way you look. Hopefully, you're happy."" On the challenges for women in Hollywood . ""I just wish ladies got better parts in movies these days. I wish we could see more of them ... young and old. ... I remember going to a 'women in film' meeting. God, it's got to be 25 years ago, and all the women there were, some of them were saying, 'Oh, things are so much better for women.' And the others were saying things were worse for women. Well, I think they're worse. I honestly do."" On her first Broadway role starring in ""Love Letters"" opposite Martin Sheen in January . ""I'm nervous and excited and thrilled, and it's going to be great for me. It's a brand new thing. I love to do new things. I hope it's all going to go well. ... I'm sort of terrified of live audiences ... but it's a good time to challenge myself. Why not?"" On @anjelicahuston recently joining Twitter . ""I'm looking forward to having nice conversations and meeting my fans. ... I think it's pretty wonderful in an ideological way. The idea that people can contact each other and contact you, and you can all have a kind of massive conversation I think is probably what's going to save the world."" On the story behind the title of her new memoir, ""Watch Me"" ""I guess I was about 28, 29 years old, and I'd been dabbling around the outskirts of show business for some time, doing little parts here and there. ... And I was at a party, and the director Tony Richardson was there, with whom I'd worked years before ... and he said, 'Oh, Anjelica, come over here. Sit on my lap, poor little you. You're never going to do anything with your life. You have so much talent and so little to show for it.' And I looked at him with love and just a little bit of hate, and I thought, 'Watch me.'

"(CNN) -- If you frequent the pistes of the French Alps, you may see more than just skiers and snowmen scattered around the trails below. For the last 10 years, British artist Simon Beck has been decorating snow-covered lakes and mountainsides with massive geometric designs, often based on fractal patterns, using his footsteps as his implement. Beck's snow drawings have attracted attention and opportunity beyond the Les Arcs ski resort in France where he got his start. This year alone, he's delivered TED Talks in Austria and Cyprus, collaborated with New Zealand clothing brand Icebreaker on a series of garments, and has seen his international Facebook following grow to 280,000. Now he adds Snow Art, a book of over 200 photos he has taken of his work, to his list of accomplishments. From engineering, to orienteering, to art . Beck's journey to art was unconventional. He was working as an orienteering cartographer when he made his first snow drawing, and before that the Oxford graduate was an engineer. He created his first snow drawing, a star on a lake near his apartment at Les Arcs, to pass the time after a day of skiing in 2004. ""When I did my first drawing, I had no idea how good it was going to look,"" he says. ""It's just so unusual and unique. No one else is doing anything like it."" But it wasn't until five years ago, when he recognized the toll that his frequent orienteering trips had taken on his feet, that he started to take his drawings seriously. ""I realized that it would probably be better to do something a bit easier than orienteering, and do something less painful,"" he says. Snow drawing went from an occasional hobby to his primary form of exercise during the winter months. One hundred and fifty snow drawings later, quite a few things have changed. Where he was once restricted to scouting locations and photographing his work from mountain tops and ski lifts, he can now afford to work out of an aircraft if he chooses; instead of winter boots, he now wears snowshoes. His work has gone from a fairly solitary pleasure to something enjoyed by thousands online. However, his techniques have remained the same. Beck still walks as many as 30 km across distances as large as six soccer fields, counting each pace as he would while orienteering, armed with nothing but a compass and a map he designed himself. A single drawing can still take as long as 12 hours to realize. But he now has his art down to science. Beck knows the best terrain (thoroughly frozen lakes), the best time to shoot (just before the drawing goes into shadow at the end of the day), and the best conditions (sunny, at least one foot of snow). He can now shift his focus from creating the perfect drawing to pushing himself creatively. Exploring new territory . Earlier this year, Beck spent time in New Zealand and Somerset Beach in the UK creating sand drawings, raking complex designs into the sand to be washed away by encroaching tides. Fans have suggested that he try his hand at working in mud or deserts, or even try mowing a lawn, but he'd most like to try his hand at creating crop formations. He'd also like to start exploring more remote lakes in the towns surrounding the Alps, like Zermatt, Switzerland. ""And there are other places I'd just like to (try) because of the location, like Central Park in New York. I'd love to do a drawing there, or on the grounds of the White House, Buckingham Palace gardens, or the parks in London,"" he adds. ""If you ever got the conditions to be right, it would be fantastic to go and do something like that, and get famous buildings in the background.""

"(CNN) -- ""The Walking Dead's"" midseason finale on Sunday - watched by a staggering 14.8 million viewers - was about as intense as it gets. There was Abraham's army returning to the church in just the nick of time and Rick putting down a cop who wouldn't stop running. Beth pushed yet another cop, the threatening O'Donnell, down an elevator, and Morgan found his way back to the church just as our group of survivors left it. But all of that action paled in comparison to the big, heartbreaking exchange at Grady Memorial Hospital (and if you went to the show's official Facebook or Instagram right afterward, you know what happened). Carol and Beth had finally been reunited with their people when Dawn demanded that Rick return her former ward, Noah. Rick objected, but Noah decided to go back. And then it happened: One of Dawn's comments set Beth off, leading to an altercation that ended with Dawn shooting Beth in the head. It was a shocking, tragic end for a beloved character. The look on Daryl's face as he carried Beth's body, followed by the anguish on her sister Maggie's face, said it all. One year after we saw the death of patriarch Hershel, the Greene family had lost someone else. Viewers struggled to come to terms with the character's death on Twitter. ""If Daryl cries, you know it was a bad night on #WalkingDead. #RIPBeth,"" said Travis Radina. Christopher Cross didn't know how he was going to get through the work day after that death. Megan Mobley was ""Still crying because Walking Dead."" Ken Jeong of ""The Hangover"" and ""Community"" summed it all up with ""Crying."" So what can we expect next?

"(CNN) -- Eduard Shevardnadze, whose political career seesawed between two extremes, has died, Georgia's GHN news agency reported Monday. He was 86. Around the world, he was hailed as the man who helped end the Cold War. At home, he was the man whose resignation as president of Georgia was greeted by cheers and fireworks. Born in Georgia in 1928, he worked his way up the Communist Party chain until he became the foreign minister for the Soviet Union under President Mikhail Gorbachev. It was then that Gorbachev announced his policy of ""perestroika,"" or change, in the Soviet Union. Shevardnadze was the international face of it. Perestroika led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. Shevardnadze helped broker the deal that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall, and he normalized Moscow's ties with Washington. The breakup of the Soviet empire gave birth to many independent republics; Georgia was one of them. Shevardnadze went home to preside over the infant nation. When he replaced ousted President Zviad Gamsakhurdia in 1992, Shevardnadze was expected to bring the country's 4.5 million people a better life. Instead, according to the watchdog group Transparency International, corruption became endemic during his 11 years in charge. Georgia landed on a list of the 10 most corrupt countries in the world. ""In the West, we think of Shevardnadze as a man who helped to peacefully end the Soviet Union, but here he became a despised man, and people described him as a dictator whom they simply could not stand having in power anymore,"" CNN correspondent Jill Dougherty said at the time. Renewed hope for the future came with Shevardnadze's promise of free and democratic elections. But the day after 2003's parliamentary vote, hopes faded when the election commission's first figures showed Shevardnadze's party in the lead. The opposition cried fraud, and the protests began -- around the clock for more than a week. Bad news came again on November 6 when officials announced a two-week delay in releasing final results. Shevardnadze tried to work things out with the opposition, but the talks failed, and up to 20,000 protesters converged on the capital city to demand his resignation. But Shevardnadze refused to step down and convened the newly elected Parliament. To many Georgians, it reflected just one more broken promise. Tired of his presidency, Georgians ushered in the bloodless Rose Revolution. Amid huge pressure from tens of thousands of protesters, Shevardnadze stepped down. ""At the beginning, I had a different mood, but now I see that it is impossible to avoid bloodshed. I never betrayed my people,"" he said. ""Now, I say it's much better to resign with no bloodshed, no victims."" People we lost in 2014 .","As Gorbachev's foreign minister, he helped end the Cold War .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- On a promenade that runs along Hong Kong's harbor, crowds of tourists jostle for their chance to photograph the city's spectacular skyline. But long after most have retired to their hotel rooms, one small group of visitors remains. The four men, who came from India in search of a better life, say they have been sleeping in the alcove of a building in Hong Kong's Tsim Sha Tsui district for almost two months as they wait for their asylum claim to be processed. ""Lots of refugees in Hong Kong live in the same conditions,"" says Mohammadi Rahman, chairman of Refugee Union, a group that advocates for asylum seekers' rights and helps them to find suitable housing in Hong Kong as they wait to learn their fate. It's a feeling that Rahman, 30, knows well. When he arrived in Hong Kong in 2007, he, too, was homeless and slept on the streets for months. For almost eight years, he has been battling what many see as the government's indifference to the plight of refugees. Frustrated by his own struggle against Hong Kong's immigration system after fleeing Afghanistan, he has become a champion for the rights of some of the city's most vulnerable inhabitants. When he was just five years old Rahman fled with his family to Iran after one of his brothers was shot dead during the country's civil war. He worked as an engineer and made enough money to help support his parents, along with his four sisters and three brothers. But he wasn't safe in Iran either, for reasons he won't disclose for fear of putting his family in danger. ""The government wanted me dead,"" he said. If he returns, he believes he will be incarcerated, tortured, or worse. In 2011, after more than three years in Hong Kong, the United Nations recognized Rahman as a refugee. Since then he has been waiting for the organization to find a third country that will take him in. Thousands living in limbo . Around 6,000 people are currently seeking asylum in Hong Kong according to the territory's Immigration Department. Refugees cannot work legally, which makes them dependent on the city's welfare system. The lucky few whose claims are successful are resettled to another country. As Rahman can attest it is an agonizing process that can take years. ""As long as you don't have a right to work, you don't have anything to live on,"" says Rahman. ""You don't have any future. You can't build your family's future, your kids' future."" Authorities provide food parcels three times a month and a rental allowance, but some asylum seekers say the assistance is not enough to cover even their most basic needs. Strength in unity . In January this year, Rahman and several dozen others like him founded the Refugee Union. The group advocates for the rights of asylum seekers, gives advice and legal assistance and helps people find accommodation. ""We created the Refugee Union to fight ... against the system with more power,"" he said. ""We have to fight together, because whatever I fight, another refugee is fighting for the same thing -- they suffer from the same thing."" In recent months, the group has held peaceful demonstrations in the heart of Hong Kong's business district to raise awareness of their concerns and put pressure on authorities. ""Most of the refugees are afraid to complain, because they think if they complain, immigration will process their application faster and will reject them, (or) will cut their welfare allowance,"" Rahman said. Since Refugee Union began its campaign, the government has increased asylum seekers' food and rent allowance, and given them additional funds for transportation, electricity and water. Rahman says that the total assistance they receive still falls below the city's poverty line. ""The Refugee Union completely changed the asylum arena by coordinating individual protests into group action,"" says Cosmo Beatson, executive director of Vision First, an NGO that is giving the group advice and logistical support. ""The goal is to empower refugees to speak up for themselves, support each other in solidarity and advocate for the changes that they desperately need because obviously collective bargaining beats solo endeavors."" Improving lives . In Hong Kong, Rahman lives with his wife in a cramped, one-room apartment that costs HK$2,800 ($360) per month. She earns HK$4,000 ($520) a month working as a domestic helper for a local family, but sends a large portion of her income back to her family in the Philippines. Every day, Rahman reads a sign that his wife has placed near their bed: ""Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass, but about learning how to dance in the rain."" He hopes one day to leave Hong Kong and start a new life. Until then, he is determined to help reform the city's welfare system so that other asylum seekers aren't forced to live ""like beggars."" ""Even though I cannot do work ... it is better for me to give my time for them, to help them to improve their situation in Hong Kong,"" he said. CNN's Michala Sabnani and CNNMoney's Charles Riley contributed to this report.","Mohammadi Rahman fled Afghanistan as a child .

"(Wired) -- It's fun to imagine what Michael Mapes' studio must look like: You would assume that the New York-based artist's workspace has to resemble the lab of a harebrained entomologist, with test tubes, specimen bags and pushpins strewn about. In reality, of course, to create the startlingly elaborate sculptural portraits Mapes is known for, he has to be much more organized than that. ""It does take a fairly high degree of organization,"" assures me. ""But that's not the hardest part."" Take a glance through Mapes' work, and you'll understand what he means. Technically, Mapes is a portraitist, though he rarely uses paint. Instead, the artist recreates the human visage by arranging fragments of a person's life—photographs, locks of hair, handwriting samples, jewelry—into highly detailed works of art. Read more: Seven hand gestures that make you look like a real intellectual . Mapes has been making these pieces for years, generally working with subjects intimately close to him. But in his newest project, he's decided to deconstruct (then reconstruct) some of the Dutch Masters' most famous 17th century portraits, rendering classics like Bartholomeus van der Helst's painting of Geertruida den Dubbelde into startling franken-portraits. Each of Mapes' pieces are constructed from what he describes as ""biographical DNA,"" the little pieces of physical information he pieces together to create a finished portrait. Typically, this is a fairly simple process with Mapes gathering his photos, bits of hair, and handwriting samples from his living subject's home and then organizing them into a portrait using test tubes, little baggies or pushpins. With the Dutch Masters series, he had to be a bit more resourceful. Mapes begins each portrait by downloading copyright-free images from various museums' websites. From there, he crops each image, zeroing in on certain features like an eyeball, fingertip or face before printing out dozens of each. ""I'm occasionally reminded that I'm not a typical customer when the manager walks the envelope of prints out to me personally with a curious eye,"" he says. Read more: Ever seen these pics of MDMA and LSD? They're Intense . He considers each subject as a collection of individual parts. ""I tend to produce hundreds and hundreds of samples before I start working with the actual composition,"" he explains. ""In this way, I can work more intuitively in the composition, again, with the spirit of a painter—in a lab coat, so to speak."" The process of gathering these bits of biographical DNA is an attempt to form some sort of cohesive picture about what the final portrait should look like. ""I generally tape a number of photos on the wall and ponder where to go from there,"" he says. Of course, Mapes' final portrait is going to look a lot like the original, only with a much more of an artistically rendered shrine vibe. There are clever and nuanced departures from the 17th-century versions. For example, one thing you notice about the Dutch Masters' portraits is how utterly PG they are. Women are shrouded in black, their necks even fully covered. ""These subjects were surely well known to the artists who painted them,"" says Mapes. ""Imagine the restraint required of van der Helst in not including a bit of Geertruida's legs."" Read more: Wildly detailed drawings that combine math and butterflies . At a distance, Mapes' work echoes the puritanical rigidity of the Dutch Masters, but when you get up close and really examine what his sculptural paintings are made of you'll notice photographs of bare legs and bits of cleavage filling out the skin tone of the Dutch Masters' subjects.

"(CNN) -- Garth Brooks appears on the verge of a tour comeback, but it apparently won't be launched in Ireland as had been planned. The country star's promoter confirmed Tuesday it was canceling ""The Garth Brooks Comeback Special Event"" in Dublin because the city council there would only approve three concerts -- not the five that Brooks wanted. ""No concerts will take place,"" a statement from Aiken Promotions said. ""The ticket return process will be outlined tomorrow."" The promoter said 400,000 tickets had been sold. Brooks' name was on a statement given to the Irish media insisting he would do ""five shows or none at all."" ""To choose which shows to do and which shows not to do, would be like asking to choose one child over another,"" the statement said. Brooks was the biggest selling solo recording act ever when he left the road and studio behind to concentrate on raising his three daughters 13 years ago. Fans have only seen him perform since then at a few benefit concerts and a weekend residency in Las Vegas. Garth Brooks works weekends in Vegas . His youngest daughter Allie graduated high school in May, relieving Brooks of his paternal duty to drive his kids from his farm in Owasso, Oklahoma, to school each morning and be there for every soccer match. Brooks revealed last December in a ""Good Morning America"" interview that wife Trisha Yearwood and his daughters had given him approval to launch a world tour in 2014. He has scheduled a news conference on Thursday for what is expected to be a tour announcement. The Dublin shows had been planned for Croke Park Stadium, a football arena that can hold more than 90,000 fans, on five consecutive nights during the last week of July. The city council approved Friday, Saturday and Sunday shows, but rejected licenses for Monday and Tuesday night concerts. The city noted the stadium was ""in a heavily populated residential area"" and five nights of Garth Brooks would be ""an over intensification of use of the stadium."" The traffic, noise and ""potential antisocial behaviour"" by Brooks fans could add up to ""an unacceptable level of disruption"" for Dublin residents, the council said. The city promised residents it would limit the number of special events to three each year when the stadium was renovated several years ago. It already hosted three concerts in May, the council's statement said. The promoter surrendered Tuesday, saying it had ""exhausted all avenues regarding the staging of this event."" Several dozen angry fans gathered outside the stadium Tuesday to protest with chants and signs, demanding the shows be allowed. CNN's Joan Yeam contributed to this report.","Dublin's city council approves just three nights, but Garth Brooks demanded five .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- When I tell people outside India that I live in New Delhi, I'm almost always asked the now inevitable question: ""Do you feel safe there?"" or worse, ""what's with the rape culture in India?"" The December 16, 2012 gang rape of a student inside a moving bus has sadly become India's defining story of the past year. CNN iReport: Do you think anything has changed? Tell us . The horrific details so ingrained in people's memories, Indian cities are now perceived by many around the world as ""rape capitals."" However, for anyone who knows India and lives here, these sweeping generalizations are simplistic and unjustified. The definition of what constitutes rape varies from country to country so there's no internationally accepted method of comparing India's rape statistics with those of other nations. New Delhi rape exposes perils of being a woman in India . But in a country of 1.2 billion people, where local sexual assault cases which wouldn't merit a mention in the U.S. or Europe now make headlines, you can be excused for thinking India is suffering from a ""rape epidemic."" Even Indian women's rights activists will agree, rape is not part of the country's culture; it's certainly not a new phenomenon and it's surely not particular to India. Heightened awareness . What is new to this country though, and what is significant, is the heightened awareness of sexual violence against women. The discourse has dominated local newspaper editorials and television talk shows this year. Women are now feeling more emboldened to ignore the stigma and report not just cases of rape, but even harassment, molestation, stalking and voyeurism. Opinion: Where have India's females gone? It is this change that makes the December Delhi gang rape a turning point for India and perhaps the victim's lasting legacy. Indian law prohibits the naming of sexual assault victims, but to her family and millions of Indians, she will be remembered by the name the media gave her: Nirbhaya, or ""fearless one."" On December 17, 2012, the day after the attack, I received a text message from students at New Delhi's prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University, informing the media of a protest being held at the location where the 23-year-old medical student and her male friend had boarded a bus the previous night. The white chartered bus that circled the city for almost an hour while the student was repeatedly raped by six men and sexually violated with an iron rod. I wasn't expecting a large showing, after all, sexual assault is sadly commonplace. Government statistics show a woman is raped every 20 minutes in India. 'Indian Spring' But when I arrived at the intersection in the upscale South Delhi neighborhood, I saw hundreds of young urban students holding hands, hoisting placards, shouting slogans. Your views: One year on, has anything changed for India's women? Send us your experiences. I remember reporting how unusual it is for this section of society to protest in New Delhi; they tend to be politically apathetic because they are the materially contented, having benefited more than others from India's economic growth over the last two decades. But one after another, young women and men took to the streets shouting, ""Enough is enough."" ""I'm protesting today because this (rape) is an everyday problem,"" explained one student. ""I can't wear what I want, I can't go where I want without men staring at me ... where is my freedom?"" asked another. What happened next was unprecedented. Day by day, the protests swelled from hundreds to thousands to tens of thousands; young and old, men and women marching to India's seat of power, jumping over barricades, braving the water cannons in New Delhi's December cold. No one expected it to become so big. Some even called it the ""Indian Spring."" The government was shaken to its core. ""Sometimes it just takes one incident to galvanize a society and to inspire change, and this certainly seems to be that watershed moment,"" I said during a live shot. Relating to victim . What was it about this particular incident that struck a nerve? The horrific nature of the act was one thing, but would people have reacted in the same way if this had happened in rural India? Probably not. As one student put it, ""we're protesting here because she (the victim) could have been me."" Many in Delhi could relate to the victim. She represented the aspirations of so many Indian girls, studying hard, daring to dream big. The victim's family migrated to Delhi from a village in Uttar Pradesh state in search of a better life. Her father worked 16-hour shifts as a baggage handler at the Delhi airport to pay for her education. She even tutored several neighborhood children to help put her two younger brothers through school. ""She had a great passion for academics. Every year the happiest day for us was when my daughter's school results would come out, she would always be one of the top two students in class,"" her father Badrinath Singh remembered proudly. She wanted to become a doctor and lift her family's status in society, a culture that places high value on social class. In some ways she succeeded. She managed to attend some of the country's best schools, get a job at an international call center, inspire her brothers to study engineering and aeronautics. On that fateful night, she was watching Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" at an upscale mall, where young girls in skinny jeans and tank tops hang out at Starbucks, shop at Zara and eat sushi. Fighting for women . One year on, I reflect on what's changed. I have met some incredibly strong women fighting against all odds in a society which often places less value on women. Meet India's Red Brigade: The teens fighting back . Sumanjeet, 25, was pressured to abort all four of her babies simply because they were girls. ""How could they afford to pay for their daughter's dowry?"" her husband asked. Daughters, especially in rural India, are often seen as a burden. A 16-year-old student from a lower caste (known as a dalit) was gang raped by eight upper class men in the state of Haryana. When her father found out what his daughter had been through, he killed himself out of shame. Relatives and neighbors advised the family not to report the case to the police because no one would want to marry a ""tainted"" girl. Victims blamed in India's rape culture . I also met a mother who has been tirelessly fighting for justice the past six years. Her daughter was gang raped by wealthier neighborhood boys when she was just a teenager. This remarkable woman has hired more than a dozen lawyers, some female, but they all kept switching sides or said they could no longer represent her. The mother suspects they were bought over by the wealthier rapists. A teen's rape has far-reaching effects . India's awakening . Under enormous public pressure, the government ordered the December Delhi gang rape case to be fast-tracked. But what about the tens of thousands of other rape cases left languishing in India's notoriously slow-moving judicial system? All of these women though, no matter what corner of India they come from, have heard about the Delhi gang rape and the justice the victim eventually got. They say they too have a sense of hope now. In the headlines this month, the managing editor of one of India's most respected investigative magazines resigned in disgrace after he allegedly assaulted a young female colleague. He acknowledged a ""lapse of judgment"" but insisted it was not assault. In another case, an intern accusing a Supreme Court judge of sexual harassment. Stories which would have likely gone unnoticed, unreported a year ago. Something has shifted in India this year. An awakening of sorts. Nirbhaya's parents take solace in this. They told me they have lost everything, their lives will never be the same but they are proud of the change their daughter helped bring about. ""Let us not forget, it was because of her sacrifice that all these changes have taken place and I believe there will be more positive changes in the future,"" her father told me, underlining the societal changes emerging out of a personal disaster.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Rapper 50 Cent entered a not guilty plea to domestic violence and vandalism charges in a Los Angeles County court Monday. The 37-year-old artist -- whose real name is Curtis Jackson -- was ordered to return to the Van Nuys, California, courtroom on September 4 for a pretrial hearing for one count of domestic violence and four counts of vandalism, according to a court spokeswoman. Model-actress Daphne Joy, who has a child with Jackson, accused her ex-boyfriend of kicking her and ransacking the bedroom during an argument at her condo in the Toluca Lake neighborhood in Los Angeles on June 23, according to the Los Angeles city attorney. Authorities allege Jackson caused $7,100 in damage to property and left the scene before police arrived. ""During an argument, Jackson allegedly began destroying the female's property,"" the city prosecutor's office said in a written statement. ""Allegedly when the female locked herself in her bedroom, Jackson kicked open the bedroom door and kicked her, causing an injury."" Police found broken chandeliers and furniture throughout the home. The bedroom closet was ransacked, with clothes thrown all over the floor, and there was a broken television and lamp, the prosecutor's office said. If convicted on all five counts, Jackson would face up to five years in jail and $46,000 in fines. Although prosecutors initially did not release the alleged victim's name, her lawyer did in a statement to CNN last month. ""Daphne Joy and Curtis Jackson have been together for a few years in an exclusive relationship,"" the lawyer's statement said. ""They had a child and now Daphne's No. 1 priority is to ensure both her and the baby's safety during this difficult time. We also hope everyone will respect her and the baby's privacy."" Joy was a principal mermaid in 2011's ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides."" She's also had roles on TV's ""CSI: Las Vegas,"" ""Criminal Minds,"" ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" and ""Wild 'N Out,"" her website says.

"(CNN) -- Texas slapped the U.S. Supreme Court in the face, and the justices just took it. On Tuesday night,  Texas executed Marvin Wilson, whose IQ score was 61 -- low enough that it should have met any standard for ""diminished mental capacity."" Shockingly, the court did not intervene to stop the execution despite its 2002 decision in Atkins v. Virginia barring the execution of the ""mentally retarded"" as ""cruel and unusual punishment"" in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Wilson played a role in the murder of Jerry Williams in 1992. He needed to be held accountable for his actions, even with diminished mental capacity. But he had the mental capacity of a first-grader, could barely match his socks and was fired from a car wash job for being too slow at drying cars. A clinical neuropsychologist with 22 years of experience concluded Wilson was intellectually disabled. Texas got away with executing an intellectually disabled person because the Supreme Court allows states to determine their own standards of ""mental retardation"" and hasn't bothered to push back when states clearly ignore its ruling. Flouting the heart of the Atkins decision, Texas decided that not all persons with ""mental retardation"" should be barred from execution, just those who ""a consensus of Texas citizens would agree"" whether they should live or die. Unbelievably, Texas had cited the example of Lennie Small, the intellectually disabled ranch hand in John Steinbeck's famous novel written 75 years ago, ""Of Mice and Men,"" to demonstrate this standard. Steinbeck's son, Thomas Steinbeck, issued a statement before the execution: ""I am certain that if my father, John Steinbeck, were here, he would be deeply angry and ashamed to see his work used in this way."" He expressed shock that ""Texas would use a fictional character ... as a benchmark to identify whether defendants with intellectual disability should live or die. I find the whole premise to be insulting, outrageous, ridiculous, and profoundly tragic."" The American Association on Intellectual and Development Disabilities was also disturbed by the lack of science and the reliance on ""false stereotypes"" in Texas' criteria. In Georgia, prisoners are required to prove ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" that they are ""mentally retarded."" The state almost executed Warren Hill, a man clinically determined to be intellectually disabled. Fortunately, he received a stay of execution, though on other grounds. Clearly, some individuals who may not exhibit the most severe signs of disability will fall through the cracks. Texas' standard leaves more than a crack through which the rare individual may slip. Wilson fell through a gaping hole because of the ridiculous criteria set by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Because the Texas Legislature failed to pass a law to catch up with the Atkins ruling, the state's high court stepped in. The United States has not yet arrived at the position that governments should not have the irreversible God-like power to execute its citizens as the majority of countries in the world have. But 10 years ago, the Supreme Court at least recognized that there ought to be limits to this awful power. The insane, children and those who are not mentally developed are more vulnerable than the rest of us. They are more easily manipulated, they are less capable of making sound judgments and they often need help carrying out basic daily functions. We treat them differently because we are humane and civilized, right? The U.S. Supreme Court will receive more cases like the Wilson case until it stands up to the states and insists that they develop better scientific and reasonable criteria for judging a person's mental capacity that respect today's standards of decency. The United States just sustained another black eye on the world stage when Texas was allowed to execute a man with the mind of 7-year-old. The egregiousness of this act is heightened for a country that claims the moral high ground and global leadership on human rights. Executing a poor, African-American, intellectually disabled man shows once again the arbitrary nature of the death penalty. That was why the Supreme Court halted capital punishment 40 years ago in its Furman v. Georgia decision. In Gregg v. Georgia, the court allowed states to resume the death penalty after a four-year hiatus provided they reserve it for the ""worst of the worst"" offenders. Wilson hardly exemplifies this principle. Amnesty International has documented several cases in recent years in which prisoners with compelling evidence of ""mental retardation"" were executed, and more than 100 cases where prisoners with severe mental illness were put to death. Again, the Supreme Court has failed to hold the states to a reasonable standard despite ruling that the ""insane"" (the legal term) must not be executed. Capital punishment is an empty symbol and an outmoded practice. It is expensive, fails to keep us safe and diminishes us all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Laura Moye.","Laura Moye: Supreme Court in 2002 barred death penalty for the ""mentally retarded""

"London (CNN) -- Britain's accused rioters are facing the courts in growing numbers, as the streets remain quiet and the police continue their efforts to bring all those responsible for rampaging through London and other cities to justice. More than 1,900 people have been arrested and about half that number charged, the majority in the capital -- and the front pages of British newspapers are filled with the accounts of those hauled up in court, many during special overnight sessions. The violence first broke out in north London's Tottenham neighborhood after a protest over the death of a local man, Mark Duggan, who Prime Minister David Cameron said was shot by police, and spread on successive nights across London and other cities. But after two nights of relative calm, much of the nation's attention has turned to what happens next for those caught -- and what the fallout from the disorder may be for British society. Several newspapers highlight the case of 18-year-old Chelsea Ives, who appeared in court in Westminster on Thursday, reporting that she was picked to be a London Olympics ""ambassador"" tasked with welcoming guests to the capital during next year's Games. But a London 2012 Organising Committee spokeswoman said Friday that Ives ""is not a London 2012 Olympics ambassador and never has been. We believe she was actually a youth ambassador for the Waltham Forest borough."" Ives was allegedly captured on video hurling bricks at a police car and was reported to police by her parents after they spotted her on a television news bulletin. She denied charges of burglary, violent disorder and attacking a police car, the Guardian newspaper reported. The Guardian also highlights the cases of an 11-year-old girl who pleaded guilty to criminal damage in Nottingham and a 12-year-old boy who admitted taking a bottle of wine from a Manchester supermarket. As thoughts turn to the weekend ahead, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, speaking in Nottingham, warned prospective troublemakers against stirring up more unrest, saying they should ""think again."" Home Secretary Theresa May announced that a march planned for Saturday by the English Defence League, a far-right group, had been banned. ""It is clear that a ban is needed to ensure communities and property are protected,"" she said in a statement Friday. A significant number of officers would be deployed in the town of Telford, 30 miles west of Birmingham, to police any English Defence League presence, she added. In Birmingham, where three young men were killed in a hit-and-run incident in the early hours of Wednesday, community groups are planning a ""peace rally"" for Sunday with the aim of promoting unity, West Midlands Police said. Londoners can expect the ""surge"" of 16,000 police officers deployed since Tuesday to remain on the city's streets through the weekend, Prime Minister David Cameron said Thursday. The huge deployment comes against a backdrop of questions over Britain's policing approach and as lawmakers raise the prospect that new powers could be granted to police to tackle future unrest. Cameron told lawmakers at an emergency session of Parliament on Thursday that police in London had waited too long to begin arresting rioters after unrest broke out Saturday. ""What became increasingly clear earlier this week was that there were simply far too few police deployed onto the streets. And the tactics they were using weren't working,"" he said. ""Police chiefs have been frank with me about why this happened. Initially, the police treated the situation too much as a public order issue rather than essentially one of crime."" This week's apparently orchestrated looting -- which occurred in different places at the same time -- presented ""a new and unique challenge,"" but police had ultimately changed their approach, he told lawmakers. Officers are now being given more tools to tackle disorder, Cameron said, with ""every contingency"" being looked at, including greater powers to ask suspected troublemakers to remove their masks. The government may also consider measures to prevent troublemakers from using social media to coordinate disorder, he said. Cameron promised a thorough inquiry into Duggan's death Saturday but said it did not justify the ensuing violence. What started as a peaceful demonstration in front of the police department by community members and Duggan's relatives and friends was ""used as an excuse by opportunist thugs in gangs, first in Tottenham itself, then across London and then in other cities,"" he said. ""It is completely wrong to say there is any justifiable causal link."" The August 4 shooting occurred when officers from a police unit that deals with gun crime in the black community stopped a cab carrying the 29-year-old father of four in the working-class, predominantly Afro-Caribbean district of Tottenham, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said. Police in the capital reported 1,144 riot-related arrests Friday, with 693 people charged. Police in West Midlands reported 467 arrests since Monday evening, and Greater Manchester Police listed 176, while police in Merseyside, which covers Liverpool, reported 74 arrests and Nottinghamshire Police 109. Some 186 officers have reported being injured since Saturday, London's Metropolitan Police said late Thursday, having had ""unprecedented violence directed against them."" Officers in London arrested a 22-year-old man Friday on suspicion of murder after the death of a 68-year-old man the previous day from injuries sustained in an attack in west London's Ealing neighborhood Monday. Richard Mannington Bowes, who the Metropolitan Police said was assaulted after he tried to stamp out a fire set by rioters, was the fifth person thought to have died in connection with the disorder. The force said Friday that three of the latest suspects to be charged included a 19-year-old man who is believed to have posted a picture on Twitter posing with a haul of suspected stolen goods and two teenage girls charged with counts including robbery, attempted robbery and possession of a knife. Cameron said those convicted can expect to go to jail and promised new efforts to deal with gang culture and reform Britain's ""broken society."" But much damage has been done, with retailers losing more than £100 million ($161 million) over four nights of looting and violence, one analysis found. Cameron promised government help for families and businesses whose properties have been damaged. They will receive tax breaks and grants, including a new £20 million ($32 million) fund to help affected retailers get back in business, he said. Police said residents could help them by identifying photographs of looting suspects. The Metropolitan Police and other police forces posted surveillance photos online. Detectives investigating the hit-and-run incident in Birmingham arrested on Thursday three more males on suspicion of murder. They are ages 16, 17 and 26. A 32-year-old man who had been arrested Wednesday has been released on bail. The three victims, ages 31, 30 and 20, were leaving prayers at 1 a.m. Wednesday and returning to a gas station they had been guarding to protect it from looters when the incident occurred, witnesses said. Another man died after being found shot in a car in Croydon, south London, on Monday night. The violence comes against a backdrop of austerity measures and budget cuts. But Cameron, community leaders and police have repeatedly pointed to a criminal, rather than political, motivation for the looting. Analysts say a mix of economic and social tensions has been at play in the unrest, with deprivation a key factor. Those seen taking part in rioting and looting have been from diverse ethnic backgrounds and span a wide range of ages, and many are young. CNN's Carol Jordan, Ed Payne, David Wilkinson, Anna Stewart and Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","Official warns against anyone stirring up new trouble this weekend .

"Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- Federal prosecutors and the FBI have opened an investigation into the killing of an unarmed teen by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida. The death drew protesters Monday to the courthouse in Seminole County, north of Orlando, to demand justice for Trayvon Martin, the 17-year-old who was shot and killed last month while walking back to his father's fiancee's house in Sanford. The African-American teen's parents said Monday that they believed race was a factor in their son's death, and the Congressional Black Caucus had called for a federal investigation, saying local police have shown ""blatant disregard for justice."" Late Monday, the Justice Department said it would dispatch officials to Sanford to investigate and ""to address tension in the community."" ""The department will conduct a thorough and independent review of all of the evidence and take appropriate action at the conclusion of the investigation,"" Justice Department spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said in a written statement. ""The department also is providing assistance to and cooperating with the state officials in their investigation into the incident."" Florida Gov. Rick Scott also weighed in Monday evening, noting that the case has ""caused significant concern within the Sanford community and the state"" and asking the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to provide ""any assistance necessary"" to local investigators. The man who shot Trayvon, George Zimmerman, has not been charged. He told police he shot the teen in self-defense, and police say they have no evidence to refute his story. Trayvon's father, Tracy Martin, told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" that his son's death was ""a matter of profiling."" ""I think that's an issue that Mr. Zimmerman himself considers as someone suspicious -- a black kid with a hoodie on, jeans, tennis shoes,"" Martin said. ""Thousands of people wear that outfit every day, so what was so suspicious about Trayvon that Zimmerman felt as though he had to confront him?"" And the slain teen's mother told NBC's ""Today"" show that the neighborhood watch captain ""was out there reacting to the color of his skin."" ""My son wasn't doing anything but walking on the sidewalk, and I just don't understand why this situation got out of control,"" Sybrina Fulton said. CNN has made numerous attempts to contact Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, but have been unsuccessful. In a statement to the Orlando Sentinel, his father says Zimmerman grew up in a multiracial family and has moved out of his home after receiving death threats. And in announcing the federal probe, Hinojosa cautioned that bringing a civil rights case requires the government prove ""that a person acted intentionally and with the specific intent to do something which the law forbids -- the highest level of intent in criminal law."" At the Seminole County courthouse, a handful of student protesters and a law professor from Florida A&M University met with a representative of the state attorney's office to discuss the ongoing investigation while protesters demanded Zimmerman's arrest. Many carried signs in remembrance of Trayvon. ""Gone but not forgotten,"" read one that had a picture of the young man wearing a football uniform. ""No justice for Trayvon. No peace for Sanford!"" read another. Assistant State Attorney Pat Whitaker told the students it would take several weeks to look at the case, but that the ""investigation of the Sanford police needs to be greatly supplemented,"" Jasmine Rand, the FAMU professor, said after the meeting. The state attorney's office also said a voice analysis would be conducted on 911 calls from the night of the shooting to determine who was yelling for help, students said. Zimmerman, 28, called police around nightfall on February 26 to report a suspicious man in his neighborhood. ""Something's wrong with him. Yep. He's coming to check me out,"" Zimmerman told a police dispatcher in a 911 call released Monday. ""He's got something in his hands. I don't know what his deal is. Send officers over here."" The teen started to run, Zimmerman reported. When he said he was following, the dispatcher told him, ""We don't need you to do that."" Shortly afterward, neighbors began calling 911 to report a fight, then a gunshot. By the time police arrived, Trayvon lay dead. He was carrying a bag of Skittles and an iced tea that he had purchased at a nearby convenience store, and was headed back to his father's fiancee's home. Martin said he's ""positive"" that his son's voice that can be heard screaming for help in the neighbors' calls. ""It's heartwrenching, because those actually were my son's last words,"" he said. ""And to hear his last words being cries of help, is devastating. It tears me apart as a father."" CNN's Roland S. Martin, Rick Martin, John Couwels, Vivian Kuo and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","The Justice Department has launched an investigation into the death of Trayvon Martin .

"(CNN) -- A gunman opened fire at two Jewish facilities near Kansas City on Sunday, killing three people, police said. Authorities are investigating whether the shootings were a hate crime, Overland Park Police Chief John Douglass told reporters. ""It's too early in the investigation to try to label it. We know it's a vicious act of violence. Obviously, at two Jewish facilities, one might make that assumption, but we're going to have to know more about it,"" he said. Suspect Frazier Glenn Cross faces charges of premeditated first-degree murder. He is scheduled to appear in court on Monday, Lt. Craig Buckendahl from the Johnson County Sheriff's Office said. Video from CNN affiliate KMBC showed a man who appeared to be the suspect sitting in the back of a patrol car and shouting, ""Heil Hitler."" Douglass said police are investigating statements the suspect made after his arrest, but declined to provide additional details. Investigators believe the suspect is affiliated with white-supremacist groups and was involved in previous incidents, such as threats, two federal law enforcement officials told CNN. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, described Cross as a longtime, ""raging anti-Semite"" who has posted extensively in an online forum that advocates exterminating Jews. The shootings occurred at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City in Overland Park, Kansas, and at the Village Shalom Retirement Community in Leawood, Kansas. Authorities arrested the suspect at a nearby elementary school after the shootings, Douglass said. The suspected shooter is not from Kansas and did not appear to know his victims, he said. A shotgun was involved in the shootings, Douglass said. Authorities are investigating whether other weapons were also involved. The gunman shot at a total of five people, Douglass said, but two of them were not injured. The FBI is at the scene working with local authorities, FBI spokesman Joel Sealer said. Rabbi Herbert Mandl, a chaplain for the Overland Park Police Department, said the victims included a teenager and an elderly woman. The shootings, which occurred the day before Passover begins, sound ""very much like a hate crime,"" he said. ""The timing is terrible. The timing is awful,"" Mandl said. ""From what I understand from my contacts, this is a one-person event, and this is hopefully under control now."" The shooting began just after 1 p.m. on Sunday, when gunfire erupted in the Jewish community center's parking lot. The center was packed with young people participating in weekend activities, like auditions for a singing competition and a rehearsal for a production of ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" CNN affiliates reported. ""This was a community center full of young teens, and they were on lockdown after the shots started,"" CNN affiliate KSHB reporter Lisa Benson told CNN. ""Some of these kids were taken into locker rooms and told to lay on the floor as the shots rang out."" Jeff Nessel told the Kansas City Star he had just dropped his 10-year-old son off at the community center when a staff member told him to get back inside because there had been a shooting. ""We'll keep you on lockdown. You're safe here,"" Nessel said a staff member told him. ""It's surreal,"" Nessel told the newspaper. ""You don't think it can happen here."" At the nearby Village Shalom retirement home, Amy Rasmussen was helping with her grandmother's laundry when residents were warned by a staff member. People ""were told by one of the staff that it was a tornado warning ... and stay away from the windows,"" Rasmussen told the newspaper. As word of the shooting spread, concerned friends and family came to the facility to check on their loved ones, KSHB reported. The victims . Two of the victims were a grandfather and grandson who were members of the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Leawood, a U.S. congressman said. Rep. Kevin Yoder told CNN the church's minister announced the news during services Sunday night. ""This has been a moment that stunned us all,"" Yoder said. Family members said Dr. William Lewis Corporon and 14-year-old Reat Griffin Underwood died as a result of injuries they suffered in the shooting at the Jewish community center. Corporon ""cherished his family, and more than anything had a passion for caring for others."" Reat was high school freshman who ""participated in debate, theater and had a beautiful voice. Reat had a passion for life, and touched so many people in his young age,"" his family said. U.S. President Barack Obama offered condolences to the victims of shootings and their families. ""I have asked my team to stay in close touch with our federal, state and local partners and provide the necessary resources to support the ongoing investigation,"" he said in a statement released by the White House. ""While we do not know all of the details surrounding today's shooting, the initial reports are heartbreaking."" Shooter's motive unclear . The Anti-Defamation League described the shootings as ""an unspeakable and heinous act of violence."" ""While it is too early to label these shootings as a hate crime, the fact that two Jewish institutions were targeted by the same individual just prior to the start of the Passover holiday is deeply troubling and certainly gives us pause,"" the organization said. ""We have reached out to local, state and federal law enforcement and stand willing and able to offer guidance and assistance to the community if this incident turns out to have been motivated by anti-Semitism."" The ADL said it warned last week of the increased possibility of violent attacks against community centers during the coming weeks, ""which coincide both with the Passover holiday and Hitler's birthday on April 20, a day around which in the United States has historically been marked by extremist acts of violence and terrorism."" CNN's Nick Valencia, Janet DiGiacomo, Evan Perez, Shimon Prokupecz and Don Lemon contributed to this report.","NEW: Suspect Frazier Glenn Cross faces charges of premeditated murder .

"(CNN) -- Creating the next Uber or Facebook may be the dream of many tech entrepreneurs, but it's only a small band that ever get to make it happen. For Jessica Livingston, giving a fighting chance to that next big idea has become a business in its own right. As the co-founder of startup accelerator Y-Combinator, she knows a thing or two about what makes a successful tech company. Her out-of-the-box idea was to provide small amounts of funding to lots of startups at once. ""A lot of times when start-ups get started, there's this kernel of an idea. It's not very exciting, all your friends and family are making fun of it,"" she said. Established in 2005, Y-Combinator focuses on providing a small amount of funding, food, work space and expertise to up-and-coming entrepreneurs. In return, Y-Combinator obtains a 7% stake in each company once it is launched. ""Y-Combinator provides funding for startups at the very earliest stages,"" Livingston said. ""We have an application process twice a year and we fund startups in batches. So we'll fund 80 startups at once over a three-month period."" $120,000 in funds . The company gives startups $120,000 and then helps them incorporate as a business. ""We then help them with their idea, help them launch and help them get press and then at the end of the three months we'll host a demo day and that is when the startups present to about 500 of the country's top investors to get follow-up funding,"" says Livingston. Since its inception, Livingston has funded more than 700 startups and 12 non-profits. Some of them are now among the best known online companies in the world including Dropbox, AirBnB and Reddit. ""When you first get started on an idea, you don't want millions of dollars in funding,"" explained Livingston. ""You wouldn't know what to do with it. You just want a little bit of money to see if your idea works and then take it from there."" She now has a keen eye for the ""next big thing"" and recognizes the role they will play in shaping the future of business. Cohesive team . Key to the success of a startup, she said, is a cohesive founding team. ""Have the founders known each other for years? Did they go to school together, did they work together for five years? One of the biggest reasons startups fail early on is because the co-founders don't get along. ""I love startups because anyone can start one if they have a computer and an internet connection. ""You can be any age, you can do it from home. And it's all about seeing if an idea can work and to me that's just so exciting. and that's what gets me up every morning."" ""It doesn't matter where you went to college. It doesn't matter who you know. We are just looking for a great idea.""","Start-up accelerator Y-Combinator provides seed money to new startups .

"London (CNN) -- Lego might not seem like the sort of thing to make your blood boil. The venerable toy is one of the most popular playthings of all time. People of all ages love it. And if previous years are anything to go by, Christmas stockings will soon be bulging with the stuff. But the irony is that because people feel such visceral affection for the toy, they tend to fly into a rage when they believe its standards are slipping. In fact, I'm getting a bit hot under the collar myself. The latest furore concerns Lego's ""franchise"" sets, which depict scenes from movies like ""Star Wars,"" ""Lord Of the Rings,"" and ""Marvel."" Principled Lego enthusiasts have been arguing that they undermine the whole point of the toy, as they encourage children to construct showpiece models from instruction booklets rather than building something from their own imaginations. ""Lego taught me the art of creative destruction -- the need to break something in order to make something better,"" wrote the blogger Chris Swan. ""Lego for me was always about creativity, remaking and improving on existing designs. Those things don't happen with the sets that are designed to build a model of a single thing. ""Good old generic Lego, with endless possibilities on offer, hasn't gone away, it's just been drowned in a sea of marketing for other brands."" Lego spokesman Roar Rude Trangbaek contested these claims. ""The bricks will probably still end up in big boxes in homes and that will act as a pool for creativity,"" he said. But many believe that the complex pieces contained in franchise sets make it very difficult for children to pursue their own designs (Lego now manufactures no less than 3,000 individual pieces). This is not the only time that Lego has found itself embroiled in controversy. In 2011, when it released ""Lego Friends,"" a range aimed at girls that included beauty parlors, cupcake bakeries and great quantities of the color pink, it was accused of crude gender stereotyping. As one seven-year-old girl wrote in a viral letter, ""all the girls did was sit at home, go to the beach, and shop, and they had no jobs, but the boys went on adventures, worked, saved people, and had jobs, even swam with sharks."" (Lego's ham-fisted attempt to address these concerns, a new set called ""Research Institute"" that featured female scientists, sold out within days.) For any discerning adult, all this makes you want to weep. Whatever happened to the idea of buying big bags of Lego for your children and letting their imaginations do the rest? It all seems a long way from the guiding principle of Lego's founder, the Danish toymaker Ole Kirk Christiansen, that ""Der bedster er ikke for godt"" -- ""only the best is worthy."" And it supports the general impression that the classic toys of previous decades are being replaced by overly commercialized, sexualized, dumbed-down bits of tat. Let's skip Sindy and Barbie and take, for instance, Playmobil. Its new City Life range, which is aimed squarely at girls, includes scenes like ""Shopping Center,"" ""Beauty Salon,"" and ""Clothing Boutique,"" all awash with sickly pink. (Because that's what girls are supposed to be into, right?) Boys, however, are presented with the ""Top Agents"" range, which includes a video camera that can be attached to a remote-control car so that kids can spy remotely on people (let's not mention the ethical tension between privacy and surveillance). This bears scant resemblance to the traditional Playmobil -- those innocent little figures with the inverted crescent smile, those skinny horses to clip them on -- which fired the imaginations of generations of children over the last few decades. Now, we all understand that toy manufacturers are not charities. They are in it for the money, and good for them. But play is a vitally important part of a child's development, and toy manufactures are uniquely placed to influence their lives -- for the better or for the worse. Why do we stand back while they ride roughshod over our kids' moral and spiritual well-being in the pursuit of maximum profit? Obviously, creating multiple differentials and marketing towards them is good for business. The more the consumer -- that is, the child -- can be sold the idea that this particular product is essential for a lifestyle aspiration, the more the dollars will come rolling in. It makes for a depressing indictment of society's view of childhood. As Christmas approaches, millions of harassed adults will stream into toy stores all over the world in search of that special something that will make their little one's eyes light up. In the vast majority of those stores, the toys will be divided by gender. Boys' toys will be largely action-based, while girls' toys will be centered around dolls, homemaking and the attempt to conform to a specific idea of beauty, all decked out in pink and tied with a bow. The gifts will be selected, wrapped and presented. There will follow two days of mayhem. The girls will instantly be wearing tacky princess dresses; the boys will be armed to the teeth and roaring. Toys that appear impressive but are actually impossible to play with will be littered in the corners of rooms. Electronic noises will blare unneeded from every corner, and children will enter a vegetative state as they sit for hour upon hour in the dystopian glow of various screens. Now, I'm not a Christian. But it strikes me that Christmas should be more than just an orgy of consumerism. This Yuletide, therefore, perhaps we should consider these questions seriously. What sort of adults will today's children become? What sort of world will they create? And what are their toys actually doing to them?","Christmas stockings will be bulging with Lego, especially sets depicting movie scenes .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Patients being treated on the floor, because emergency rooms are overcrowded, medical sources say. Medicines running low. And, according to a Health Ministry spokesman, fuel shortages such that only half the available ambulances can run and the generators powering lights in hospitals might only last a few more days. Sources there say that is the reality nowadays in Gaza, a dire situation that looks like it will persist or perhaps get worse -- since neither Hamas nor Israel's government have shown any indication of backing down. Rockets being fired from Gaza into Israel are menacing and can be dangerous. Case in point came Friday, when a woman was hurt after a rocket hit a house in Be'er Sheva, according to Israel's military. Every day, there are more such attacks, each one potentially lethal. Earlier Friday, for instance, Israel Defense Forces reported that two soldiers were lightly wounded in an attack by an anti-tank missile. Hostilities between the two sides picked up weeks ago -- tensions that were exacerbated by the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli teenagers. There's a disparity in the human toll in the latest fighting. No Israelis have been killed so far by the hundreds of rockets fired toward southern Israel by Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other militant groups in Gaza. Some Israelis have been wounded. More than 100 people -- including at least 23 children and 24 women -- have been killed and nearly 800 others have been injured in Gaza from Israeli strikes, according to Dr. Ashraf Al-Qidra, the spokesman for Gaza's health ministry. The toll kept rising Saturday, after an Israeli strike in Jabalya in northern Gaza that Hamas security sources said killed members of the Islamic Jihad militant group. Those places where the injured are being treated aren't necessarily safe havens, either: Al-Qidra told CNN that at least one hospital in Gaza was shelled. The medical sources who described the overcrowded emergency rooms in Gaza and dwindling supply of medicine characterized what is happening there as not unlike the chaos witnessed at Syrian hospitals during its civil war. And even those not in hospitals or who haven't been impacted directly by airstrikes face significant challenges. CNN staff in Gaza reported there are rolling blackouts, and there are water shortages in some areas because airstrikes have damaged pumping stations. Israeli authorities insist that they want peace, and that they are striking back in order to defend their territory. As things stand, they contend, doing nothing is not a valid option. To that point, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated Friday that there is one path to a cease-fire: the cessation of attacks from Gaza. Observers wonder whether Israel will escalate its defense with even more offense -- by sending troops into Gaza. Nothing is off the table, Netanyahu said. ""We are considering all options and getting ready for every possible scenario,"" he said. ""All the citizens of Israel are aware of my major goal, and this is to bring back the quiet to all Israeli territories. Hamas keeps attacking us, and therefore we are fighting them back."" Rocket from Lebanon . Israel faced attack from a second front Friday, but it is unlikely that a rocket fired from Lebanon signifies the widening of the conflict with Hamas. The rocket launched from Lebanon landed near the northern Israeli town of Metula, which sits right by the Lebanese border, and no damage or injuries have been reported. It was not immediately clear who fired the rocket. An IDF spokesman said Israel holds the Lebanese government responsible for the attack, but concerns that Israel will face a two-front conflict are unlikely to be realized. Hezbollah, which operates in Lebanon and is caught up in other conflicts in the region, probably does not have the appetite to start a war with Israel. Thousands of rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel during a war in 2006, but rocket attacks since then have been sporadic. Tensions are always high between Hezbollah and Israel, but Hezbollah's involvement in Syria's civil war means that a fight with Israel might not make sense. Nonetheless, Israel responded with artillery that landed in the vicinity of the Lebanese town of Kfar Shouba. No casualties were reported, the Lebanese army said. Israel calls up reservists . As fears of an Israeli ground assault grew among Gaza residents Thursday, Israel revealed it has beefed up its forces by calling about 30,000 reservists to their units. ""We are utilizing that force to enable us to create a substantial force around Gaza, that if it is required, we'll be able to mobilize as soon as possible,"" Israel Defense Forces spokesman Peter Lerner told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. The Israeli Cabinet has authorized the military to call up 40,000 troops if needed. That is 10,000 more than were called up during Israel's offensive into Gaza in November 2012. The Israel Defense Forces said Friday that since the start of Operation Protective Edge, more than 570 rockets have been fired at Israel. The country's Iron Dome defense system has intercepted more than 100 of them, the IDF said. Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza are believed to have about 10,000 rockets of varying ranges, according to the Israeli military. Israel has said some 3.5 million residents live in areas within reach of the rockets. U.S. willing to help broker cease-fire . Hopes for a cease-fire appeared dim even as world leaders called for the two sides to stop the violence. U.S. President Barack Obama and Netanyahu spoke by phone. ""The United States remains prepared to facilitate a cessation of hostilities, including a return to the November 2012 cease-fire agreement,"" the White House said in a written statement, referring to the Egyptian-brokered deal that halted the previous Israel-Hamas conflict. The President also condemned rocket attacks from Gaza and said the United States reaffirmed Israel's right to defend itself. From Samson and Delilah to Israeli-Palestinian fighting .

"(CNN) -- The bomb and gun rampage that left 77 people dead in Norway last summer could have been avoided, an independent report found Monday. Anders Behring Breivik is on trial in the bombing in central Oslo that left eight people dead, followed by a shooting spree at a youth camp on nearby Utoya Island, where 69 people died. ""The police and security services could and should have done more to avert the crisis,"" said Alexandra Bech Gjor, head of the July 22 Commission looking into the attacks. Norway PM: Honor dead by celebrating life . Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said after the report was published that he had ""ultimate responsibility for the preparedness in our country, a responsibility I take seriously."" But he said he would not resign. According to authorities, Breivik set off a fertilizer bomb outside the prime minister's office on July 22, 2011, killing eight people. He then took a ferry to Utoya Island, the site of a Labour Party youth camp, where more than 700 young adults were meeting. Authorities say he roamed the island shooting at campers, killing 69 people before members of an elite Norwegian police unit took him into custody. Experts disagree about whether Breivik was sane at the time of the killings, a critical factor in what sentence he will face. Norway prosecutors want mental institution for Breivik . He does not deny the killings but says they were necessary to protect Norway from multiculturalism. Police could have reacted faster during the attacks, saving lives, the new report found. ""A more rapid police operation was a realistic possibility. The perpetrator could have been stopped earlier on 22 July,"" the investigators concluded. Police operations centers were understaffed, and the availability of helicopters was ""limited,"" the report said. Police forces faced immediate criticism after the attack because they had to travel to Utoya Island by boat rather than helicopter. But the failures of ""leadership and communication"" were more significant than failures of resources, the commission found. Police information-sharing ""is subject to formidable weaknesses,"" and the Police Security Services had not done enough training for a terrorist attack, the commission said. The Oslo bombing itself ""could have been prevented through effective implementation of already adopted security measures,"" the report found. Admitted Norway killer asked to stop fist salutes . It also suggests that police could have been aware of Breivik before the attacks took place, but said there were ""no grounds for contending that the Police Security Service could and should have averted the attacks."" The report criticizes Norway's gun controls as ""inadequate,"" even though ""Norway is a country with a large number of weapons."" And it suggests a failure to understand that one person operating alone ""could cause so much devastation."" Police are due to respond to the report later Monday. The investigators praised the health and rescue services for their response to the wounded and bereaved, and said government communication with the public was good despite the attack on its headquarters. Norway's government set up the commission after the attacks, the worst massacre in Norway since World War II. The commission had access to confidential reports, interviewed hundreds of people and got access ""to everything we asked for,"" its report says. Norway's Breivik gives chilling account of gun massacre . CNN's Alex Felton and journalist Olav Mellingsaeter contributed to this report.","NEW: The prime minister says he will not resign over the report .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Manchester United beat Manchester City 4-3 in a frenetic English Premier League on Sunday which United manager Alex Ferguson described as the ""best derby of all time."" At the River Plate and Boca Juniors matches, the atmosphere can swell to boiling point. But while the Manchester derby certainly stirs the passions, Football Fan Zone has scoured the world to select 10 other local match ups which stir the emotion of the club's faithful. Do you agree with our selection ? Tell us about one you think should make the top 10 in our Sound Off box below. 1) CELTIC v RANGERS -- Glasgow, Scotland . These two are the bitterest of bitter rivals. Not only are they divided by football, but by religion as well, with Rangers taking their support from the Protestant community and Celtic the Catholic community. The hostility has become so intense that both clubs have asked their fans to stop singing the sectarian songs that had become commonplace on match days. To add fuel to the fire, they are consistently the only two teams who challenge for the Scottish title, with the make-up of the Premier League ensuring they face each other four times in a season, not including cups. Despite both clubs attracting some top foreign stars, the helter-skelter nature of the fixture has not been diluted over time, as confirmed by the number of dismissals over the years. 2) ROMA v LAZIO -- Rome, Italy . Undoubtedly the fiercest derby match in Italy, these two rivals really hate each other. Violence in and around the Olympic Stadium between the sets of supporters, and the police, has become an all-too-common occurrence in recent seasons. Both teams hate the perceived arrogance from the Northern cities (Milan, Turin) -- but they loathe each other more. Roma take their support from a traditional working-class fan base, while Lazio's support tends to come from the wealthier districts. The historical political differences between the fans is another reason for this rivalry. Lazio's supporters, in general, followed right-wing ideals while the Roma fans leaned more to the left. 3) BOCA JUNIORS v RIVER PLATE -- Buenos Aires, Argentina . Although by no means the most ""local"" derby in South America (the clubs are about 7km apart), it is undeniably the most intense. The rivalry, hatred and violence involved are based on social class and money. Both clubs were founded in the poor district of Buenos Aires called La Boca, but River Plate moved to a wealthier area called Nunez in the 1930s, heightening the animosity between the clubs. Boca Juniors' stadium is known as ""La Bombonera"" (The Box of Chocolates) because of its layout. The steep stands and the lack of a running track makes for a particularly intimidating atmosphere. 4) AL AHLY v ZAMALEK -- Cairo, Egypt . Arguably Africa's most passionate derby, this match brings together two of the continent's most successful clubs. Their rivalry is so strong that foreign referees are always brought in for the derby games and, following a number of violent incidents, matches between the two have been moved to the 75,000 capacity Cairo International Stadium. On the pitch, Al Ahly currently have the upper hand, winning the last four league titles. 5) GALATASARAY v FENERBAHCE -- Istanbul, Turkey . The Bosphorus separates the city of Istanbul into a European side and an Asian side. Galatasaray, on the European side, have traditionally been the wealthier of the two clubs, while Fenerbahce, on the Asian side, have a largely working-class following. However, in recent years, Fenerbahce have attracted a number of wealthy fans who have pumped money into the club, thus unbalancing the equilibrium. Nowadays, there is nothing to choose between them on and off the pitch. The last five league titles have alternated between the two clubs and both clubs have won 17 Turkish championships. 6) OLYMPIAKOS v PANATHINAIKOS -- Athens, Greece . This is the derby between the two giants of Greek football, although the rivalry between the two also exists in basketball, Greece's national sport. In the past, Olympiakos, from the port area of Piraeus, used to represent the working class, while Panathinaikos represented the upper-class suburbs of Athens. Nowadays, the situation has evened out. However, on the pitch, Olympiakos are the dominant club, having won 11 of the last 12 league titles, including the last four in a row. 7) RED STAR BELGRADE v PARTIZAN BELGRADE -- Belgrade, Serbia . This is a relatively new fixture: both clubs were founded in 1945, but what they lack in age, they make up for in passion. Partizan was founded as the football section of the central club of the former Yugoslavian Army, while Red Star was founded as the civilians' club. Red Star, or Crvena Zvezda as they are now known, have traditionally been the more successful, achieving the ultimate of winning the European Cup in 1991. 8) WYDAD v RAJA -- Casablanca, Morocco . These two are the biggest clubs in Morocco and violence between the fans often mars these fixtures. Wydad used to dominate honors, but in recent seasons Raja have enjoyed more success. N.B. Raja means ""hope"" and Wydad means ""love,"" although there is certainly no love between the rivals when they face each other! 9) PALMEIRAS v CORINTHIANS -- Sao Paulo, Brazil . Another derby that has been going for nearly 100 years. Corinthians used to be the only club in the city, but a group of Italian members broke away to form Palmeiras, earning the nickname of the ""betrayers"" by Corinthians fans. Morumbi is the biggest stadium in Sao Paulo and all the derbies are played there, although the Pacaembu stadium, which hosts many Corinthians matches, is also used for the occasion. 10) PENAROL v NACIONAL -- Montevideo, Uruguay . One of the oldest derby matches in the world, with both clubs being formed in the 1890s. The two most honored clubs in Uruguay, they share a remarkable 85 Uruguayan league titles and eight Copa Libertadores championships between them. The derby is always played in the Centenario Stadium, with a capacity of almost 74,000, although Nacional also have their own ground in a different neighborhood of the city.

"(CNN) -- The Syrian Electronic Army -- a group of pro-Syrian regime hackers that has aggressively targeted major news organizations and activists -- may operate in cyberspace, but its attacks can have real-life impact. The power of misinformation was amply demonstrated when the group hacked the Associated Press Twitter feed Tuesday. The fake AP message -- which read, ""Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured,"" -- caused a brief flurry of panic and sent stocks plummeting. The tweet was quickly revealed as false, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered from its 145-point dip, but it was nearly a day before the AP Twitter account was restored to life. Now, fresh questions are being asked about what the Syrian Electronic Army is, where it's from and how it operates. In its own words, on is website, the Syrian Electronic Army says, ""We are a group of enthusiastic Syrian youths who could not stay passive towards the massive distortion of facts about the recent uprising in Syria."" Over the past few months, the group claims to have hacked British broadcaster the BBC and U.S. outlets CBS News and NPR, as well as Columbia University and rights group Human Rights Watch. The group even compromised the Twitter account Monday of the head of world soccer, FIFA President Sepp Blatter and FIFA's official account for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. But much about the Syrian Electronic Army remains unknown. 'Tacit support' from Syria . One key question revolves around how close the group is to the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which has been involved in a bloody civil war for more than two years. On that subject, all the signs are of ""tacit support,"" says Helmi Noman, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto. He has been tracking the Syrian Electronic Army since May 2011, when it first emerged as an organized group with a Facebook page and then its own website. ""What we know is their domain name was registered by the Syrian Computer Society. We looked into the Syrian Computer Society and discovered that it was headed by al-Assad in the 1990s, before he was president,"" said Noman. ""It's hosted on the network of the Syrian government, which is interesting because it's the first time we've seen a group with questionable activities being hosted on a national computer network."" Al-Assad has also backed the group by name and ""expressed his appreciation for their work and described them as a real army on the Internet,"" he said. However, Noman and his fellow researchers do ""not have evidence that this group is actually a Syrian government operation."" Even if it were, he points out, the Syrian government would be unlikely to be open about it. This is in part because it could face legal and political consequences for its actions -- for example, over the financial loss suffered as a result of the fake AP tweet, he said. Who the individual members of the Syrian Electronic Army are and where they're from is also shrouded in mystery. The group has sought to recruit volunteers through its Facebook page, inviting them to flood selected websites with pre-prepared spam comments, said Noman. ""Of course, we cannot tell if these volunteers are from Syria only, or from other countries,"" he added. Many people are familiar with Anonymous, the hacker collective that is known for its DDOS, or distributed denial of service, attacks that take websites offline, and backed the 2011 Occupy movement and WikiLeaks' Julian Assange. But while the Syrian Electronic Army's activities bear some similarities to those of Anonymous, the group is quite different in other ways, said Noman. Not only do its domain name and registration betray clear connections with Syria, but its members are reachable through the group's website, Facebook and Twitter pages. Disrupting the flow . The group also appears robust, bouncing back despite the efforts of U.S. authorities and Twitter to suspend its activities. And Noman has noted an evolution in the Syrian Electronic Army's methods over time. Early attacks focused on apparently irrelevant websites, but later efforts shifted first toward compromising the Facebook pages of organizations seen as hostile to the Syrian government, and now high-profile Twitter accounts. ""They demonstrate interest in disrupting the flow of information, especially the flow of information from international media,"" Noman said of the group. This is not surprising because it is in line with what the Syrian government itself has tried to do, in accusing the regional and international media of being biased against it, he said. Tuesday's attack on the AP Twitter feed shows ""an escalation in depth but not in scale,"" Noman said. While the Syrian Electronic Army has compromised the Twitter accounts of several international media organizations before, the kind of message sent to the AP feed was more disturbing. The attack on BBC Weather's Twitter feed, for example, was hard to take seriously. ""Syrian Electronic Army Was Here,"" read one tweet. ""Saudi weather station down due to head-on collision with camel,"" said another. Others were more inflammatory -- ""Hazardous fog warning for North Syria: Erdogan orders terrorists to launch chemical weapons at civilian areas"" -- but still not credible. What is worrying about the AP Twitter hack is that next time there is breaking news on Twitter, people will wonder if it's true or just another compromise, Noman said. It's a warning to everyone to step up their own online security measures -- and be aware that not all they read may be true. READ MORE: AP hack proves Twitter has a serious cybersecurity problem .

"(CNN) -- The Los Angeles Kings scored in double overtime Friday night, defeating the New York Rangers 3-2 and winning their second Stanley Cup in three years. Alec Martinez slapped in the winning goal and the National Hockey League's championship trophy went to the Kings after a thrilling Game 5 at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles. The Kings had to work hard to claim the prize. Los Angeles took an early lead with a goal by Justin Williams, but the Rangers battled back and tied it with a power-play goal by Chris Kreider late in the second period. Brian Boyle scored again for the Rangers minutes later, making the score 2-1 New York. The Kings tied it 2-2 in the third period with a power-play goal by Marian Gaborik. The crowd chanted ""We want the cup"" as the game headed down the stretch of regulation time. The scrappy Rangers took only one game in the series, a 2-1 victory Wednesday in New York. Los Angeles netted its first Stanley Cup in 2012 by defeating the New Jersey Devils. That title ended decades of futility for a franchise struggling for success in a sport typically associated with frigid temperatures and icy lakes. Their run over the past couple years has given the Kings attention and traction with a metropolitan fan base dominated by the NBA's Lakers and Clippers, baseball's Dodgers and Angels, and football and basketball at UCLA and the University of Southern California.

"(CNN) -- It's a good bet that millions of Americans on Monday greeted President Barack Obama's magnificent second inaugural address not just with applause and cheers of approval but with loud sighs of relief. Gone were his first inaugural speech's bizarre equal division of blame for the wreckage of real lives between the ""greed of some"" and the so-called ""collective failure"" of the rest of us. Instead, Obama rang out his commitment to equality for all, not the ""shrinking few and lucky"" who call the rest of us simply ""takers."" Nor did our president chide us to put away ''childish things"" by seeming to describe deep differences over ""perpetual war,"" climate change, immigration, equal rights, voting rights, rights to decent wages for honest labor and rights to ""basic measures of security and dignity"" as ""petty grievances."" This time around, Obama offered us not song and dance morals from an old Depression musical comedy to ""pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off and start all over again,"" but solid, specific support for the serious New Deal pillars of Social Security and Medicare. Opinion: Obama's ringing defense of liberalism . Almost for the first time as president, he dared to utter the word ""poverty"" in a major address, and declared ''we must be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice."" These moments and more earned his speech the warm response and respect it deserves. Now it will receive the careful analysis it cannot escape. This will reveal even more profound differences between Obama's second inaugural speech and his historic appearance on the steps of the U.S. Capitol as the president of color few believed they would see elected in their lifetimes. 1. His first inaugural address was a puzzling disappointment after the passionate convictions he expressed so powerfully in both his primary and general election campaigns. Some suggested that his finest moment was Election Night in Chicago's Grant Park. No one who followed his campaign, including his opponents, could have been surprised by his second inaugural speech. 2. Monday's words were those of a leader who has chosen to fight for the change he believes in over flailing attempts to placate that only produced astounding charges that he was unwilling to compromise when in fact he had given so much in doomed efforts to do just that. 3. His repeated calls for ""We the People"" to work together were not-so-subtle warnings of who would be responsible if the U.S. government is unable to do so. No blame-splitting this time. 4. Even Obama's delivery and demeanor conveyed conviction, not the sense that a press aide might soon emerge from Caesar's tent beside the Rubicon to explain that his thinking is still ""evolving."" Opinion: How Obama made opportunity real in America . In this second inaugural address, Obama the Candidate became Obama the President without a trace of the bait and switch to which too many citizens have become so accustomed that in their cynicism they cease to vote at all. He spoke as a leader who has stopped splitting differences and is prepared to make choices and fight for them -- together as We the People if possible, alone as Obama the President if not. Opinion: Obama's America, better than what Founders imagined . In fact, Monday's speech felt as if after four frustrating years of trying to appease his opponents, Barack Obama had finally met Machiavelli one night in the Lincoln Bedroom and learned that when faced with two equally powerful opposing forces, a president must choose, or both will attack him. He sounded like a leader who knows now that the difference between making a choice and making love is that decisions don't feel better the longer you can draw them out. As Obama goes from celebration to celebration, his supporters and his opponents have a much clearer idea of what he will do tomorrow, and for the next 1,000-plus days he is president. This time when he tells banks and insurance companies that ""a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play,"" they will do well to believe him. Because even with all the cash he collected to fill the coffers of his campaign, Monday's speech makes it clear he will not let it line the coffin of his presidency. It betrays no security measures to mention that the Secret Service chooses oddly accurate code words for the presidents it protects. After Obama's first inauguration, that could have been ""dancer."" After Monday's address, it could legitimately consider ''leader."" If the president is able to act in accordance with his second inaugural address, it's not impossible now to imagine ""Lincoln."" He wasn't afraid to fight when the nation would not stay together. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gordon Stewart.","Gordon Stewart says Obama's second inaugural speech made up for the mistakes of his first .
Stewart: Obama spoke as a leader who is prepared to make choices and fight for them .
He says unlike the disappointing first inaugural speech, there was no blame this time .
Stewart: Both Obama's supporters and opponents have a clearer idea of what he will do next ."
"(CNN) -- Dr. Paul Offit doesn't take any vitamins. In fact, while you might think that vitamins are great in any quantity, Offit urges you to take a step back and think before swallowing the equivalent of eight cantaloupes in a single dose. ""I think that alternative medicine is often given a free pass,"" he told CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. ""I think we should hold alternative medicine to the same standard that we hold conventional medicine. It lives under this sort of untouchable halo. I think we should be a little more skeptical."" Offit, chief of the division of infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, is no stranger to controversy -- previously he has taken on the anti-vaccine movement. His book ""Do You Believe in Magic? The Sense and Nonsense of Alternative Medicine,"" came out Tuesday. Vitamins and supplements, representing about a $27 billion industry, are necessary to convert food into energy, but it's possible to take them in excess, Offit said. For instance, it's not uncommon to hear of someone taking 1,000 milligrams of vitamin C, but that's about the same amount in 14 oranges. ""Vitamins live under this notion that you can't possibly hurt yourself,"" he said. ""But you can, by challenging Mother Nature and taking these vitamins and concentrating them to these exceptionally large quantities that you would never normally eat."" Opinion: Alternative healing or quackery? You may have heard the term ""antioxidant"" as a buzzword that applies to some vitamins. Antioxidants combat free radicals -- molecules produced when your body breaks down food, or by environmental exposures like tobacco smoke and radiation, according to the National Institutes of Health. Free radicals damage cell membranes and DNA. Doctors recommend a healthy intake of fruits and vegetables containing antioxidants to prevent this from happening and apparently decreasing the risk of conditions such as cancer and heart disease. However, oxidation is necessary for life, and preventing too much of this process can be a bad thing because cells that need to be destroyed, such as cancer cells, won't be. There have been several important studies showing the harmful effects of vitamins. As Offit wrote in an op-ed the New York Times, a 1994 New England Journal of Medicine study on 29,000 Finnish smokers found beta carotene was associated with lung and heart disease death. Beta carotene and vitamin A in combination were shown in another New England Journal of Medicine study to be linked to a 46% greater risk of death from lung cancer than placebo. A 2012 Cochrane review of multiple randomized clinical trials showed an increase in risk of death may be linked to beta carotene and vitamin E, as well as higher doses of vitamin A. The likely explanation, Offit said, is that supplemental antioxidant vitamins, taken in large quantities, cause unnatural behavior in the body, counteracting oxidation too much and leaving the immune system weaker in its defenses against invaders. In response to Offit's op-ed, the nonprofit Consumer Healthcare Products Association countered that there is research underscoring the benefits of multivitamins, and that these supplements are prominent in the health care regime of many consumers. ""Consumers should always use caution when considering 'megadoses' of any supplements, carefully research these choices, and consult a healthcare professional with questions,"" the CHPA said. ""While Dr. Offit shares his own hypothesis on supplemental antioxidants in this piece, it has yet to be substantiated. Until that time, we look forward to future research that would provide guidance for public health."" The Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade association representing the dietary supplement industry, reacted strongly to Offit's book, saying he ""weaves together a series of tired old arguments."" ""Dr. Offit's credentials as a respected medical physician are well-established, making his dismissal of the value of dietary supplements all the more unfortunate,"" council president Steve Mister said in a statement. ""With more than 150 million Americans taking dietary supplements each year, it would be a shame if consumers reading this book mistake the opinion of one doctor for the opinion of the medical community as a whole. It is important for consumers to have an open dialogue with their health care practitioners about their dietary supplement regimens, and hopefully this book won't deter them from doing so."" The abundance of strong studies on the harmful effects of megavitamins suggests to Offit that these supplements are worse than Vioxx. That was an anti-inflammatory drug that its manufacturer, Merck, voluntarily withdrew from the market in 2004 after evidence emerged of its harm to the heart in some people. ""I think if vitamins were a regulated industry, you could argue that megavitamins would have a black box warning on them,"" he told CNN. Because the industry is not regulated, Offit said, no one knows if alternative remedies are actually the same, or have a standard concentration, from batch to batch. No safety or efficacy data is available, either, the way there is with pharmaceuticals regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, he said. ""I think people have the misconception that these products -- dietary supplements and vitamins -- are made by elves and old hippies that have meadows and flowers,"" he said. The 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act had the effect of defeating the FDA's attempt to regulate the supplements industry, so consumers don't know what they are buying, Offit said. ""We are the victims of enormous marketing campaign regarding some of these vitamins and supplements,"" he said. Despite the widespread popularity of vitamins and supplements, doctors shouldn't encourage patients to take these substances just because they want them, he said. ""I think the message is this: That patients are not customers, and we're not waiters."" CNN's Miriam Falco contributed to this report.","Studies have shown that vitamins have been linked to disease and death .
Too much antioxidant vitamins may disrupt the immune system's natural processes .

"(CNN) -- Mythical mermaids have fascinated humans for centuries, and alluring creatures in bikini tops and fish tails seem to be keeping the love alive. One of the first mermaid shows in the United States can be traced back to Weeki Wachee Springs in Florida, where mermaids debuted synchronized ballet moves at an 18-seat theater in October 1947. Mermaid shows have evolved from that Florida roadside attraction off U.S. 19. Here are five spots where mermaids are making a big splash: . The Sip 'n Dip Lounge: Great Falls, Montana . The mermaid attraction at the Sip 'n Dip Lounge in Great Falls, Montana, started when a housekeeper at the adjoining O'Haire Motor Inn agreed to put on a costume and swim around for guests on New Year's Eve 1995. A glass wall between the bar and the 21,000 gallon swimming pool provided a perfect place for tiki lounge patrons to take in a show. A live piano bar had been the primary entertainment until Sip 'n Dip general manager Sandra Johnson-Thares and her mother came up with the idea to add mermaids. They thought it would boost the lounge's ""fun factor."" ""I never in my life believed the mermaid attraction would be such a big hit,"" said Johnson-Thares. Both locals and tourists are drawn by the kitschy entertainment. Celebrities like ""Splash"" mermaid Daryl Hannah have stopped in for a visit, too. ""People are fascinated with them, and it's not something you'd expect to see in Montana,"" she chuckled. Johnson-Thares makes the mermaid costumes using stretch velvet fabric and ""a lot of sequins."" Six women work part-time as mermaids five days a week. ""Some of our mermaids are students and others are moms,"" she said. ""We use the newspaper and radio to advertise for mermaid positions when they open up."" Photos: Mermaid parade is 'a hidden exotic gem' Downtown Aquarium: Denver, Colorado . By day, Denver native Allison Wos is an executive assistant at a health care company. But after hours, the 26-year-old transforms herself into a mermaid. ""It's really enjoyable work, and I feel privileged to do it,"" she said. ""Our audiences get a kick out of it, too, and seem mesmerized by our shows."" Wos said she is one of eight women who dress up and perform as mermaids at Denver's Downtown Aquarium, an aquarium, entertainment and dining facility. One of her favorite aspects of the job is swimming alongside the various sea life in the salt water tanks. ""I consider eels, sea turtles, Queensland groupers, yellowtail snappers and a whole host of fish my co-workers,"" she laughed. The sea turtles are her favorite because they seem to like the spotlight and interact nicely with the mermaid team. The ""Mystic Mermaids,"" as they're called, perform daily in a family-friendly show at the aquarium's ""Under the Sea"" exhibit and in a tank adjoined to the restaurant. Dive Bar: Sacramento, California . Guests of the upscale Dive Bar are treated to performances by mermaids and mermen mingling with fish inside a 7,500-gallon tank. ""The crowd goes wild when the guys hop in the tank and are treated almost like rock stars,"" said Rachel Smith, a mermaid at Dive Bar. ""The guys who work as mermen are very macho and portray a warrior and tough guy look inside the tank."" Smith, who has been a professional mermaid for a year and a half, said she landed the job after sending her employers a videotape resume of sorts of her swimming in a mermaid outfit. ""I love to swim and made my own mermaid tails as a side hobby. When I found out about this job, I just knew it had to be mine,"" she said. Smith helps design the costumes her fellow mermaids and mermen wear inside the tank. She enjoys picking out jewelry, sequins and other accessories for their outfits. The bar is open seven days a week until 2 a.m., according to its website. Wreck Bar: Fort Lauderdale, Florida . The landmark Wreck Bar at the Sheraton Fort Lauderdale Hotel draws guests with its shipwreck theme and underwater mermaid show. Marina Duran-Anderson is the creator and director of the MeduSirena Underwater Swimshow at the bar and has five trained aquatic performers and four apprentices who entertain crowds on Fridays and Saturdays. ""You never see the same show twice, since our shows don't follow a stage show review format,"" Duran-Anderson said. ""Our shows are organic."" Their 30-minute performances take place in the hotel's chlorinated pool, which features several portholes with a view into the lounge underneath. Duran-Anderson, who has been performing underwater for more than 25 years, goes by the stage name ""MeduSirena"" as well as ""Marina the Fire Eating Mermaid"" since she is also an expert fire-eater and will include this skill in some of her acts. If you happen to make your way to a show one day, be sure to toast the performers with a ""Fire Eating Mermaid"" cocktail at the bar. Silverton Casino: Las Vegas, Nevada . You can find just about anything you could ever desire in Las Vegas -- including mermaids. The Silverton Casino Hotel's Mermaid Restaurant and Lounge is home to a 117,000-gallon saltwater aquarium where five mermaids share a home with more than 4,000 tropical fish. Heather Carrasco, who is also a synchronized swimmer and an Olympic Gold medalist from the 1996 Games, said swimming with the sea life is one of the best aspects of her job as a mermaid. ""Believe it or not, stingrays are very loving, and I especially enjoy swimming with them in the aquarium."" The mermaid show, which is free of charge, is the only one in Las Vegas, according to Carrasco, and they swim Thursdays through Sundays. Carrasco said she has two children who often remind her that she has the ""coolest job ever."" Got another theme bar recommendation?

"(CNN) -- A military contractor's plane crashed Wednesday upon approach to a Navy air base in Southern California, killing the sole person aboard. The aircraft, operated by the Airborne Tactical Advantage Company, went down as it was nearing Naval Base Ventura County in Oxnard, about halfway between the coastal cities of Santa Barbara and Santa Monica. Capt. Mike Lindberry, a spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department, tweeted it's not known whether the Hunter Hawker aircraft's pilot ""ejected or if chute was part of (the) debris field."" ATAC flies small jets used in exercises at the Navy base, according to base spokeswoman Kimberly Gearhart. She said that the contractor leases space on the base. Naval Base Ventura County was established in 2000, combining two World War II-era locales in Naval Air Station Point Mugu and Construction Battalion Center Port Hueneme. It's now home to more than 80 military commands, according to the base's website. CNN's J.R.

"(CNN) -- A 12.76-carat pink diamond has been unearthed in an Australian mine, the largest ever found in the country. Christened as the Argyle Pink Jubilee, the diamond was found in mining giant Rio Tinto's Argyle diamond mine in Western Australia's East Kimberly region. The Argyle mine is the world's largest producer of pink diamonds, with Rio Tinto reporting that the mine generates more than 90% of the global market supply. ""A diamond of this caliber is unprecedented -- it has taken 26 years of Argyle production to unearth this stone, and we may never see one like this again,"" said Argyle Pink Diamonds Manager Josephine Johnson in a statement. Rio Tinto expects that after two months of assessment and planning, it will take ten days to cut and polish the diamond into a single stone. The finished stone will be offered for sale during the company's annual Argyle Pink Diamonds Tender later this year. According to Australia's Herald Sun, the diamond will be worth at least US$1.07 million. However, it is premature to judge the stone's significance at this point, according to Sotheby's Asia department head of jewelry, Chin Yeow Quek. ""It is hard to judge a stone in the rough. It really depends on how large the rock will be polished downed to,"" he said, explaining that diamonds tend to lose at least 50% of their weight during the polishing process. ""It also depends on the [intensity of] color and clarity,"" he added. He cited as a benchmark the 24.78-carat fancy intense pink diamond sold by Sotheby's Geneva office in November, 2010 for more than US $46 million, which set the world's auction record for any diamond and jewel at US$1.86 million per carat. Natural pink diamonds are considered one of the most valuable types of diamonds, and are typically found in museums, fine auction houses, and on the hands of royalty. The company said the Argyle Pink Jubilee is in a similar light pink color to the 24-carat Williamson Pink that Britain's Queen Elizabeth II received as a wedding gift.","A 12.76-carat rough pink diamond was found in a West Australian mine owned by Rio Tinto .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan's population will shrink by a staggering 30% by 2060, according to a new estimate by the country's government. The current population will shrink from the current level of 128 million to 86.74 million, as the graying nation's aging accelerates and the birthrate continues to stay low. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare's research organization released the data on Monday. The group, called the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, provides a 50-year demographic forecast every five years. The institute also projects that people age 65 and older will account for 39.9% of the total population in 2060. In 2010, the elderly accounted for 23% of the population. The country's average life expectancy dipped in 2011 after the March earthquake and tsunami, which killed approximately 19,000 people. But the institute expects the upward trend for life expectancy to continue. By 2060, the government projects women will live until 90.93 years and men 84.19 years. The fertility rate, which is currently at 1.39 per woman, will continue to fall, says the institute. The rate by 2060 is expected to fall to 1.35 in 2060. The country's population decline would slow if the birth rate rose to 2.07.","A new study predicts Japan's population will be at about 86.7 million by 2060 .

"(CNN) -- A group of Texas clinics that provide abortions are asking the U.S. Supreme Court for emergency action to keep their facilities open, in the face of state restrictions that went into effect last week. A ruling by a federal appeals court earlier this month gave Texas the green light to move forward on the mandate requiring all abortion clinics in the state be ""ambulatory surgical centers,"" regulated under the same standards as hospitals. Another challenged provision would force doctors performing abortions to first obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. Abortion rights groups said 13 reproductive health clinics were forced to immediately close Friday after the court ruling, leaving only a handful still operating. The time-sensitive appeal was filed with Justice Antonin Scalia, who gave Texas officials until Thursday to respond in writing. Scalia would then presumably ask his other eight colleagues to weigh in before issuing an order on behalf of the court. Any order would only have temporary effect, until more appeals can be filed on the larger questions of the Texas law's constitutionality. That process may take several months, at least, to resolve. The Supreme Court refused to intervene previously when other sections of the Texas law were challenged in court. Lawmakers in the state's Republican-majority Legislature have said the regulations would improve patient care and safety. Abortion rights groups counter, saying the law is designed to make it nearly impossible to operate an abortion clinic in Texas. The Center for Reproductive Rights had sued Texas this past spring, on behalf of a coalition of abortion clinics. In August, a federal judge ruled that the ""ambulatory surgical centers"" requirement was unconstitutional and imposed an injunction. Thursday's appeals court ruling lifted that injunction and allowed the measure to go into effect immediately. Lauren Bean, spokeswoman for the state attorney general's office, said in a statement after that ruling, ""This decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the Texas Legislature to craft a law to protect the health and safety of Texas women."" Abortion rights groups counter the mandate will leave women of reproductive age in the state with minimal health care options, and called the appeals court decision ""demonstrably wrong."" ""Over 900,000 Texas women of reproductive age, more than a sixth of all such women in Texas, now reside more than 150 miles from the nearest Texas abortion provider, up from 86,000 prior to the enactment of the challenged act,"" said the clinics in their emergency application to the high court. ""Women's ability to exercise their constitutional right to obtain an abortion will be lost, and their lives will be permanently and profoundly altered,"" by having those clinics remaining closed. Supporters said before the bill was enacted, there were 41 facilities in Texas providing abortions. H.B. 2 also bans abortions past 20 weeks of pregnancy and tightens usage guidelines for ""abortion-inducing drugs"" such as RU-486. Critics contend the law, in addition to eliminating abortion across huge swaths of the state, will further deny access to many women in rural communities and will force women to seek dangerous ""back-alley"" abortions. Republican Gov. Rick Perry signed the bill into law last year. The high court case is Whole Woman's Health v. Lakey (14A365). CNN's Azadeh Ansari contributed to this report.","Abortion clinics ask Supreme Court to intervene .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Barack Obama poked fun Saturday night at his chief of staff and ribbed Washington's elite during a black-tie dinner at Alfalfa Club, a 93-year-old Washington social club. Colin Powell chats with other guests at the Alfalfa dinner in Washington on Saturday night. The first African-American president began by poking fun at the club's historical roots. ""I know that many you are aware that this dinner began almost 100 years ago as a way to celebrate the birthday of General Robert E. Lee,"" Obama said, referring to the man who commanded the Confederate army during the Civil War. ""If he were here with us tonight, the general would be 202 years old. And very confused."" The ceremony was closed to the media. But the White House released excerpts of the president's remarks. The Alfalfa Club was started by four Southerners in Washington's Willard Hotel in 1913. Its sole purpose was an annual night out for the boys, and it took its name from a thirsty plant that sends its roots deep down looking for liquid refreshment. The club remained exclusively open to men until 1994, when women were admitted as members. Arizona Sen. John McCain, whom Obama defeated for the presidency, and McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, also attended the event. Obama saved most of his ribbing for his chief of staff, Rahm Emmanuel, who has a reputation for being quick to anger. ""Now, this hasn't been reported yet, but it was actually Rahm's idea to do the swearing-in ceremony again,"" he said. ""Of course, for Rahm, every day is a swearing-in ceremony."" On the president's first full day in office, Chief Justice John Roberts re-administered the oath of office to Obama after they flubbed during the inauguration.

"(CNN) -- Acting West Virginia Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin will join the families of the 29 men who perished in an explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine a year ago Tuesday. The April 5, 2010, explosion was the worst mining disaster in the United States since 1972, when 91 miners died in a fire at the Sunshine Mine in Kellogg, Idaho. The Big Branch mine -- owned by Massey Energy -- had a spotty safety record prior to last year's explosion, with three deaths reported over the previous 12 years. Most of the blast victims were working in an area where long-wall cutting was taking place. The technique uses a large grinder to extract coal and creates large amounts of coal dust and methane gas, both of which are explosive. The remembrance ceremony will take place Tuesday in Whitesville, which is located 30 miles south of Charleston. Tomblin will be joined by other state dignitaries, his office said. Last month, Tomblin unveiled a new, specially equipped truck designed to help rescue trapped miners -- part of that state's response to the Big Branch explosion. ""I am still saddened by the loss,"" Tomblin said at the time. ""The families of the (Upper Big Branch) tragedy have said, 'Don't let this happen again.'"" The truck is ""fully equipped to provide mine rescue teams with the tools needed to greatly improve a mine rescue operation if and when called upon in the future,"" according to the acting governor.

"(CNN) -- Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko outlined a program of social and economic reforms Thursday that he said are aimed at preparing his country to apply for EU membership in 2020. Since he took office in June, Poroshenko has pursued a pro-European agenda despite opposition from Russia. ""This program foresees about 60 reforms and special programs that will allow Ukraine to prepare for submitting in six years a bid for membership of the European Union,"" he said, according to national news agency Ukrinform. Poroshenko also told reporters Thursday in Kiev that a nearly three-week-old ceasefire between Ukraine's military and pro-Russia rebels in the country's east is holding. This, he said, was ""the first day in many many weeks and months when Ukrainians have not had a single person killed, and not a single person wounded."" Poroshenko said he expected to hold a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin within the next three weeks. He did not specify the venue of the meeting, just saying that it would be held in Europe. Minsk deal . The ceasefire deal was agreed to following a phone conversation between the two leaders and negotiations between representatives of Kiev, Moscow and the pro-Russia rebels in Minsk, Belarus. Kiev and the West accuse Moscow of arming and supporting the rebels and of sending Russian troops over the border to fight with them. The Ukrainian Parliament and the European Union last week ratified a political and economic agreement that also includes free trade provisions, though they won't come into force until the start of 2016. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's decision to drop the EU Association agreement late last year in favor of closer ties with Moscow triggered the popular unrest that led to his ouster in February, followed by Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region a month later and months of deadly conflict in eastern Ukraine. U.S. support . At the same time, Poroshenko appealed to the U.S. Congress for greater support for his military, but the request was rebuffed. The United States has sent nonlethal assistance such as blankets and night vision goggles, but won't provide lethal aid. In his speech to the U.N. General Assembly Wednesday, President Barack Obama again promised that the United States and its allies would support Ukraine, while calling on Russia to follow ""the path of diplomacy and peace."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov discussed the importance of a full and prompt implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreement during a meeting Wednesday, a senior State Department official said. Journalist Azad Safarov reported from Kiev and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London.

"Washington (CNN) -- When two focus groups met earlier this week -- conducted using ""Walmart moms"" or women ages 29-54 who've shopped at the big-box retailer recently, they revealed the secret behind how this crucial demographic decides whom they vote for this year: Google. ""You Google it,"" said participants from North Carolina when asked about their voting decision process. ""Probably the night before,"" said another North Carolina woman, on when she looks up information on candidates. The women were part of two, ten-person groups in North Carolina and Louisiana on Monday night that were underwritten by Walmart. In both states, female Democratic Senators are running in tight reelection races, meaning that the women in the focus groups represent an essential category of voters Democrats need to keep those seats and hold on to control of the Senate. The racially, ethnically and educationally diverse group of mothers expressed concern about the future throughout most of the three-hours of focus grouping. Many were concerned about Ebola and less so about ISIS. They can recall the negative ads in their respective Senate races, but on the whole, don't know the candidates well. And even though Republicans have tried to tie every Democrat to President Barack Obama, the women didn't see the unpopular president as a campaign issue, even if they think he is doing a bad job. What was most striking in the group, however, was how distant the Senate races in each state felt to the women. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, in Louisiana's Senate race, between Democrat Mary Landrieu, Republican Bill Cassidy and independent Rob Maness, almost $40 million has been spent. Upwards of $80 million has been spent in the race between Thom Tillis and Kay Hagan in North Carolina. All that money, though, has bought very little with these women. ""Nothing is going to change,"" said Lauren, a 44-year old North Carolinian. Politicians ""stand where they stand. Nothing is going to change the next two weeks. It is going to be like you are cramming for a test."" Their interest doesn't mean they aren't concerned, however. The Walmart moms of this particular focus group say they are worried about the future, anxious about their children and feel like politicians in Washington don't understand their daily struggle. We are ""out of site, out of mind,"" said Jennifer, a 38-year old cafeteria worker and mother of one. ""Unless you are out there serving that child at school, or helping that student with just learning how to be nice with one another... or you are getting up at 4:30 in the morning so you can beat the rush hour and get to work on time."" After a slight pause, she added. ""They don't [understand], they can't."" When asked what one message they would communicate to leaders in Washington, the women struck a similar tune: My representatives in Washington have lost touch with their roots and don't understand my struggle. ""I wish you could have been in my shoes, and seen [the] struggle of a single parent,"" said Theodosia, a 40-year old women who voted for Obama in 2012. ""I remember where I came from,"" said Andrea, a 32-year old mother of three who voted for Romney. ""I work hard for everything I have, tangible and intangible,"" said Jennifer. Her comment resonated with the women, they nodded as she said it. In North Carolina, most of the mothers recalled very little about Hagan or Tillis. Hagan, they said, was trying to portray Tillis as unstable, while Tillis was trying to cast Hagan as another vote for Obama, the women said. But other than that, not much stuck. In Louisiana, where there was slightly more definition, the women struggled to name all three candidates. The women could remember Landrieu's positive ad -- including a ""cute"" one with her father -- and recalled attacks that ""she doesn't even live here any more."" (Earlier this year, questions about Landrieu's residency were raised by a story in the Washington Post that said the senator doesn't own her own house in Louisiana and, instead, lives at her home on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. The senator has vehemently denied the charge.) ""If she doesn't live here, how is she supposed to know what the true problems are,"" said one woman. ""How is she supposed to know?"" But that is really where the recollections ended. What did universally stick, however, was that all the campaigning has been negative. ""All I get from all of those [ads] is don't vote for that person, because they are a bad person, vote for me,"" said one woman in North Carolina. When asked what the Landrieu campaign wanted voters to think about Cassidy, one woman in New Orleans put it this way: ""That he is the devil."" The reason they feel disconnected, according to women in both North Carolina and Louisiana, is that the people who represent them in Washington are of little concern to them because those politicians could never fathom their daily struggle. The women told stories about struggling to pay for their children's education, their health care and their groceries. They talked about dealing with their spouse's job loss or trying to make ends meet with little. They also became animated when talking about the upcoming holidays and how they plan to save money to provide all they can or their kids. And when reflecting on all of this, the women said the same thing: The politicians asking for my vote don't get all of this. ""Moms say politicians 'don't get it' and need to 'walk in my shoes,'"" read a memo about the conversation from Neil Newhouse and Margie Omero, two pollsters who helped organize the group. ""This is a perennial Walmart mom complaint that frankly only gets louder with each conversation."" This sentiment was encapsulated by Jennifer, the woman from North Carolina who said she struggled for everything she has. ""Once they go home to the farm, it isn't a dirty farm,"" she said of when lawmakers leave North Carolina and go to Washington. When they come home, she said, their farm ""is a clean farm... with a tractor that would make John Deere faint.""","Two focus groups were conducted using women ages 29-54, a crucial demographic .

"(CNN) -- Another day, another record broken. Lionel Messi must sometimes wonder what all the fuss is about but to those in the outside world who remain permanently entranced by the genius contained within his feet, it was another opportunity to unleash a barrage of superlatives towards a football phenomenon. Just days after breaking the record for the top scorer in Spanish football history, Messi went one further, establishing himself as the leading marksman in the history of the European Champions League. Messi scored a hat-trick for Barcelona in its 4-0 victory against Apoel Nicosia in Cyprus on Wednesday to take his tally to 74 goals in 91 appearances. Raul, who scored 71 goals in 142 appearances, was unlikely to hold onto his record for much longer with Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo rewriting the history books. Messi,who began the night level with Raul, required 38 minutes to break the record before adding a couple more for good measure later on. He now sits three clear of Ronaldo, who will hope to feature for Real against Swiss side Basel on Wednesday night. It is easy to forget that Messi is only 27. This latest landmark is just one in a number which he has reached in recent years. The Barcelona forward, whose future at the club has come under some question in recent weeks, hit the headlines last weekend by scoring a hat-trick in the 5-1 win over Sevilla. Telmo Zarra's record of 251 Spanish league goals had stood for 59-years but it would take a brave person to bet against Messi's remaining longer. Messi's record of 253 will no doubt be extended in years to come as will his exploits in the Champions League. The forward has scored 368 goals in all competitions for Barcelona so far, while he registered 91 times during an incredible 2012 -- beating the previous best of 85 in a calendar year by Gerd Muller. The 2011-12 campaign was one of Messi's most successful as he scored 68 goals, 50 of those coming in just 37 league games, 44 with his left foot and just one with his head. Messi, who won the prestigious Ballon d'Or four times between 2009-12, netted in 21 consecutive league matches last season which enabled him to score against every other club in the Spanish top flight. With his team safely through to the next stage of the competition, Messi will hope to inspire Barcelona to Champions League glory following a disappointing campaign last year. One man who is eager to help Messi achieve the feat is Luis Suarez, who scored his first goal for the club since joining from Liverpool. Suarez scored the opening goal in Cyprus before Messi took over, scoring three times to secure the win. Barcelona sits second in its group, a point behind Paris Saint-Germain, which defeated Ajax 3-1 to remain top. Awesome Aguero . Messi wasn't the only Argentina striker to hit a hat-trick on Wednesday as Sergio Aguero's triple propelled Manchester City to a 3-2 win over Bayern Munich. Trailing 2-1 to 10-man Bayern, Aguero scored twice in the final five minutes of the contest to keep his side's qualification hopes alive. Bayern, which is already through to the knockout phase, suffered a nightmare start when Mehdi Benatia was sent off for a professional foul on Aguero. The forward stroked home the penalty as City took control only to be knocked out of its stride before the break. Xabi Alonso's free kick drew Bayern level and Robert Lewandowski added a second just before the break. City looked down and out but Aguero's late heroics ensured City can still qualify for the next stage. That's because AS Roma was held to a 1-1 draw by CSKA in Moscow. Francesco Totti rifled home a free kick for the Italian side which was pegged back in the final minute of stoppage time. Roma will qualify for the next stage if it defeats City, while the English club can progress with a victory or a score draw if CSKA loses. CSKA must win at Bayern and hope that the other game finishes level. In Group G, Chelsea secured top spot with a 5-0 thrashing of Schalke in Germany. John Terry fired the visiting side ahead before Willian doubled its advantage. An own-goal by Jan Kirchoff made it three before Didier Drogba and Ramires completed the humiliation. In Group H, Porto ensured it will finish top with a 3-0 win at Bate Borisov, while Shakhtar was beaten 1-0 by Athletic Bilbao.","Lionel Messi becomes top scorer in Champions League history .

"(CNN) -- President Obama hosted what amounted to an interactive fireside chat Thursday, answering questions from people around the country in the first online town hall discussion ever hosted at the White House. President Obama fields questions Thursday in an online town hall meeting. Standing in front of a TV screen and joined by a live audience, the president fielded online questions concerning education, the mortgage crisis, job outsourcing, national service, assistance for veterans and health care. Four of the six virtual questions were displayed on the screen in a written format; the other two were video submissions. Almost 93,000 people submitted more than 104,000 questions to the administration's Web site, WhiteHouse.gov, which streamed live video of the meeting. Obama had promised to answer the most popular questions as decided by online votes; the site had recorded more than 3.6 million votes for specific questions by the time voting closed Thursday morning. Obama also fielded questions from the audience joining him in the East Room of the White House. As the town hall got under way, the president repeatedly steered the discussion toward larger economic themes, most notably the recent spike in job losses. He warned that even if the economy has already bottomed out, unemployment probably would continue to get worse.  Watch Obama warn that job losses could continue » . Unemployment, he said, is typically a lagging economic indicator. In a lighthearted moment, the president said that the White House had received many questions about the potential economic upside of legalizing marijuana. Obama did not display any of the questions, but he did briefly address the topic. Watch Obama say legalizing marijuana 'not a good strategy' » . ""This was a fairly popular question. ... I don't know what this says about the online audience,"" the president joked. ""No, I don't think this is a good strategy to grow our economy."" Obama also discussed education reform, an issue he has championed during the 2008 presidential election and during his time in the White House. Obama, responding to a question about school reform, said more money is needed to bring about change. Watch Obama says schools need more funding » . ""So a lot of times in Washington, we get an argument about money versus reform. And the key thing to understand about our education system is we need more resources and we need reform,"" he said. ""If we just put more money into a system that's designed for the 19th century and we're in the 21st, we're not going to get the educational outcomes we need."" Obama, who revolutionized the use of technology as a political tool during his campaign, is the first president to address questions from the public live on the Internet. By allowing people to submit any question they want and answering selected ones live on the Web, the administration hopes to create a more transparent style of governing that will help win public support, political observers say. ""This is just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Don Tapscott, author of ""Growing Up Digital,"" a book exploring the generation that has grown up on the Web. ""It turns out that the Internet is a new medium of human communication that not only helps you get elected, it changes the way you govern."" Watch more on Obama's online appeal » . Former presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton engaged in online chats with citizens, but neither relied on the Internet as a platform for reaching the American public as Obama does, said Andrew Rasiej, co-founder of the Personal Democracy Forum and the techPresident blog. ""It's changing the relationship between the president and the country,"" Rasiej said. ""It's building on a 21st-century information-age platform. We want to make sure our president isn't stuck in a bubble."" Some observers wondered whether Obama's creative social media initiatives, dubbed Obama 2.0, would continue once he entered office. But Thursday's online meeting -- potentially the first of many -- reaffirms his commitment to engaging with Americans through technology, Rasiej said. Adam Ostrow, editor of Mashable.com, a guide to social media, says the online town hall-style meeting will encourage Americans to get involved beyond the election. ""It gives people a sense of participation and [of being] able to shape some of the decisions that will be made,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- An al Qaeda leader in Yemen was among those killed in what a Yemeni official called a ""counterterrorism strike,"" the latest such strike at a time of intensified fighting in the Arab nation. The Yemeni official said Wednesday that those killed include Shawki al-Badani, whom the U.S. State Department named a ""specially designated global terrorist"" in June. So, too, was Nabil al-Dahab, a top member of the conservative Salafist group Ansar al Sharia. Initial reports out of Yemen sometimes prove untrue. That said, the United States similarly believes al-Badani was killed in a strike, according to two U.S. officials who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity. They said they are still trying to confirm whether al-Dahab was killed. The officials would not say if the two men were at the same location. U.S. drones have been active in attacking suspected militants of late in Yemen, given the continued strength there of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, one of the terrorist network's most active and high-profile branches. Al Qaeda resurgent in Yemen amid political turmoil . On Tuesday, for instance, local security officials said that U.S. drones had killed at least nine suspected al Qaeda members. Getting al-Badani -- if and when his death is confirmed -- would appear to be a significant step for U.S. and allied forces. According to the State Department, he was a leader in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula who was reportedly assigned to target the U.S. Embassy in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa. He's also been connected to May 2012 suicide bombing that killed more than 100 Yemeni soldiers and a summer 2013 plot that led to the closure of 19 U.S. diplomatic posts in the Middle East and Africa. Fighting continues on the ground in Yemen as well. Surge in fighting threatens Yemen's survival . The warring parties include not only Yemeni troops and AQAP militants, but also Houthis, members of a militant group that follows the Zaidi sect of Islam. The Houthis have managed to defeat al Qaeda on numerous fronts, last week sweeping its militants from a stronghold in Al Baitha province. Adding to an increasingly volatile situation, a secessionist movement in the south of Yemen, al Hirak, has stepped up protests in Aden, Yemen's chief port and the largest city in the south.

"(CNN) -- A speeding vehicle struck and killed three girls Friday night, including twins, who were trick-or-treating in Southern California, authorities said. The girls, all 13, were in costume and carrying bags of candy in a residential area in Santa Ana. They had the right of way at a crosswalk near an elementary school when a car hit them Friday night and sped off, according to the Santa Ana Police Department. They were hit about 6:45 p.m., the Orange County Fire Authority said, according to CNN affiliate KTLA. All the girls were declared dead at the scene, CNN affiliate KABC reported. Authorities have not identified them pending notification of next of kin. Witnesses said the driver was speeding, and police are searching for two male suspects who fled on foot, the affiliate said. The vehicle, a Honda CRV, was found nearby. ""We do have a witness that followed the vehicle for a short period of time and eventually led us to where the vehicle is parked now,"" Santa Ana Police Chief Carlos Rojas told KABC. KTLA said investigations indicated the vehicle was going at least 50 mph -- twice the listed speed limit of 25 mph. The girls were thrown more than 100 feet, authorities said. One of deadliest nights of the year . Halloween is one of the deadliest nights of the year because of the high number of drunken drivers and pedestrians on the road, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Two years ago, 48% of all crash fatalities during Halloween involved a drunken driver, compared with 31% on an average day in the same year, according to the agency's most recent data. The deaths in California were just some of the tragic incidents that happened Friday. In Lake Wales, Florida, in central Florida's Polk County, a 2-year-old boy was killed along U.S. Highway 27 by a bus transporting a work crew home, CNN affiliate WFLA reported. According to a Polk County Sheriff's Office report, the boy was out with two adults and two children when one of the adults dropped his cell phone. The adult left the children in the median of the highway and told them to stay there while he went back to retrieve his phone. The other adult waited on the highway's shoulder. The 2-year-old climbed out of his stroller and walked back to the highway, where he was struck by the bus. According to WFLA, the bus driver was unable to see the child and couldn't stop the vehicle in time. The highway's northbound lanes were shut down for four hours. In Greece, New York, near Rochester, two minors were hit by a car, CNN affiliate WHAM reported. One person, a 16-year-old, was seriously injured. The other minor, a 3-year-old, was killed. The car stopped, and police are investigating. Injuries in Illinois, Arizona . In Winnetka, Illinois, just north of Chicago, a 3-year-old boy was struck and dragged by a car, CNN affiliate WLS reported.

"Washington (CNN) -- Many Americans are planning to get a glimpse of Prince William and his wife, Kate Middleton when they arrive in New York City next week -- and it seems that President Barack Obama wants in as well.

Before The Duke of Cambridge leaves the White House grounds, Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Biden are expected to host him in a separate event. Kate will not join her husband on the D.C. leg of their three-day trip, opting to tour a child development center with New York City's first lady Chirlane McCray instead. While it is unknown exactly what the two global leaders will discuss, Obama acknowledged William's commitment to raising awareness against illegal wildlife trafficking, an issue he is scheduled to talk about at the World Bank.

"(CNN) -- A powerful earthquake struck early Saturday off the coast of northern Japan -- rattling nerves in a region rocked three years ago by a deadly tremor, tsunami and nuclear crisis, though thankfully the latest episode didn't nearly measure up. The Japan Meteorological Agency at one point issued a tsunami warning, which it later amended to tsunami advisories for coastal regions in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures. The latter is the site of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power facility that was the center of a weeks-long radioactive crisis. But a large tsunami never materialized. At 6:15 a.m. Saturday (5:15 p.m. ET Friday), the same agency noted that all tsunami advisories had been canceled. Whereas before the JMA urged everyone to ""get out of the water and leave the coast immediately,"" that last update was less alarming. ""Pay attention when fishing, swimming or engaging in other activities,"" the agency noted, ""as there may still be slight sea-level changes for the time being."" The Japan Meteorological Agency characterized the quake as a 6.8-magnitude. Yet the U.S. Geological Survey had it a little weaker, downgrading its earlier estimate in calling it a 6.5-magnitude tremor. According to the USGS, the quake was centered off Honshu island some 129 kilometers (79 miles) east-southeast of Namie and 284 kilometers east-northeast of Tokyo. It was 11 kilometers, or 7 miles, deep. There were no immediate reports of damage. Any sizable tremor in or near Japan -- and any tsunami warning -- inevitably raises dark memories dating to March 11, 2011, when a 9.0-magnitude struck 231 miles northeast of Tokyo. That quake, the fourth largest on record since 1900 and the largest ever to hit Japan, produced a tsunami with 30-foot waves . When all was over, the combination of the quake and, especially, the tsunami left some 16,000 people dead. The event also set off a prolonged crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in the northern part of Honshu, including the spread of some radioactive material and very real fears of an even worse calamity as authorities tried to bring the dangerous situation under control. A repeat of that situation seemed unlikely after the early Saturday earthquake. A spokesperson for TEPCO, the utility company that controls the Fukushima Daiichi facility, told CNN there were no disruptions to operations at the plant and that everything was operating normally.

"Washington (CNN) -- The one-sentence order from the U.S. Supreme Court was brief but emphatic. The year was 1972 and the justices were asked to decide something extraordinary in that era: whether an openly gay couple from Minnesota had a ""fundamental right"" under the Constitution to legally wed. In just 13 words, the court under Chief Justice Warren Burger dismissed the Baker v. Nelson petition, ""for want of a substantial federal question."" For about four decades that was the final word on the issue, at least legally. Now a generational shift in public acceptance has given same-sex marriage a powerful new voice. Judges around the country -- in state and federal courts -- have spoken with a near unanimity over the past year that millions of gays and lesbians have been denied an equal protection right to tie the knot, or to have their legal unions recognized by their home states. Opinion: Marriage equality is not like abortion . The public debate is back at the nation's highest court, with the justices being asked to offer a fresh, definitive, and binding ruling. The court next week will return from its summer recess and meet privately to consider appeals originating from same-sex couples in five states: Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Wisconsin and Indiana. If one or more of those petitions are accepted now for review, oral arguments would likely be held early next year, with a monumental opinion expected by late June 2015. ""The question of whether same-sex marriage bans are constitutional is a historic issue, under the Constitution and for the Roberts Court,"" said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com and a respected Washington attorney. ""It's hard to imagine a situation where judges are going to have more power to define the social and family relationships of the country."" A patchwork of state laws on the issue . Same-sex marriage is legal in 19 U.S states plus the District of Columbia: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington state. Massachusetts became the first to grant the right in 2004. A Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage would essentially end a patchwork of state laws -- some that allow it, some that do not, and a few that allow protections short of marriage, such as civil unions and domestic partnerships. The highest court by its nature is a deliberative body, preferring almost by instinct to take things slowly, allowing issues to percolate in the lower courts and in the political discourse. Did Obama drop Supreme Court hint? White House says no . Not so here. What has been most remarkable about the issue is how rapidly the core constitutional questions have reached the justices, presenting an inevitability among those on both sides of the debate they will get involved. The court hurried to schedule the appeals from the five states for its closed-door conference, even before all the legal briefs had been filed. That suggests the justices are ready to add the controversies to the docket, and now. Some conservative activists say this bench should slow down, and ultimately stay out. ""When the court on such an issue -- where there are very strong opinions on both sides, and a huge issue of social change in our country -- steps in and makes it into a constitutional issue, it makes the justices look significantly more political in the eyes of the American people,"" said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network. ""It would cast doubt on the legitimacy of the court ... by imposing one type of solution for the entire nation, instead of leaving it in the hands of the states to decide how they want to address this issue."" Many supporters of ""traditional"" marriage privately say preserving an inflexible one-man/one-woman definition of wedlock nationwide would not be realistic moving forward, and that a divided bloc of states upholding the status quo may be the best possible scenario. But all that hinges on what the Supreme Court does and does not do. A federal appeals court in August took just nine days after intensive oral arguments to issue its sweeping conclusion that voter-approved same-sex marriage bans in Indiana and Wisconsin were unacceptably discriminatory. And state leaders then took just five days to formally ask the Supreme Court to intervene. Even Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently hinted a ""why wait"" attitude may predominate. ""I think the court will not do what they did in the old days when they continually ducked the issue of miscegenation,"" she told the Associated Press in July, referring to state bans on interracial marriage, which was not struck down by the high court until 1967. ""If a case is properly before the court, they will take it."" In their private conference on Monday-- just the nine justices, no one else attends-- the court will discuss among itself whether to grant a ""petition for a writ of certiorari,"" essentially if any of the marriage cases deserve full scrutiny. It takes just four justices to put such petitions on the docket, but five to ultimately prevail on the merits. ""The stakes are incredibly high for Americans and for the legacy of the Roberts court,"" said Elizabeth Wydra, chief counsel of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center. Moderate-conservative ""Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has been a crucial vote on the question gay rights [in the past], is again expected be a crucial vote in this case."" The high court's big cases this year . More than 80 pending marriage equality lawsuits in 31 states . State and federal judges in the past year have ruled 39 times in favor of the expanded marriage right, while two have upheld existing laws. All this follows what the Supreme Court in 2013 said peripherally on the issue. Fifteen months ago, the justices cleared the way for same-sex marriages in California to resume after they ruled private parties did not have ""standing"" to defend a voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock. More importantly, the high court also rejected parts of the federal Defense of Marriage Act in its 5-4 ""Windsor"" decision, citing equal protection guarantees to conclude same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits, such as tax breaks. That federal question now morphs into the higher-stakes state jurisdiction, where marriage laws have traditionally been controlled, and where the equal protection issues will ultimately be resolved. By CNN's count, various individuals and gay rights groups have launched more than 80 pending marriage equality lawsuits in all 31 states with current bans. A Supreme Court review would put all that litigation on hold. However, the nine justices have complete discretion to stand on the sidelines for now -- and wait for a majority of these state battles to play out, or for a federal appeals court to uphold a ban .","Public debate over same-sex marriage returns to the Supreme Court .

"(CNN) -- As a Muslim American, I didn't think anything could shock me when it comes to anti-Muslim bigotry. But I have to give it up for Oklahoma state Rep. John Bennett, a Republican, who has set a record for the vilest anti-Muslim comments yet. What makes Bennett's comments so alarming is that they weren't directed against Islamic terrorists such as ISIS, but rather against Muslim Americans, people like my family, friends and me. A few weeks ago, Bennett posted on Facebook using his account ""State Representative John Bennett"" that Christians should be ""wary"" of Muslim Americans: ""The Quran clearly states that non-Muslims should be killed. Arab is the ethnicity, not Muslim or Islam. Be wary of the individuals who claim to be 'Muslim American.' Be especially wary if you are Christian."" Despite calls for Bennett to apologize for inciting hate against Muslim Americans, he instead escalated his campaign of bigotry. On Monday, Bennett held a public forum with more than 100 constituents in a Western Sizzlin' steakhouse in Sallisaw, Oklahoma. There, Bennett provided his supporters with something other than steak -- a big helping of hate. According to the Sequoyah County Times, Bennett told the audience that Muslims are a ""cancer that must be cut out of the American society."" He added that the goal of Muslims is ""the destruction of Western civilization from within."" But here's where Bennett's comments truly become bone chilling. Bennett, a military veteran, issued what some could interpret as a call to arms: ""I'm not advocating violence against anyone ... but I am not going to stand back and allow them to let Islam take over this nation."" So how did the audience at the Western Sizzlin' respond to Bennett's speech? With a standing ovation. How do you explain to a Muslim American child growing up in Oklahoma that a room full of people cheered when an elected official called you a cancer who must be cut out of America? On Tuesday, Bennett appeared on a local news program to answer questions about his comments. Did he apologize? Nope, instead he doubled down with the remark, ""Muslim Americans who subscribe to Islam are just as bad as ISIS."" In reality, Muslim American organizations across the nation, including one in Bennett's own state, have publicly denounced ISIS and condemned their actions as not only being horrific but as also being un-Islamic. Could Bennett's comments lead to violence against Muslim Americans? I think so. Also sharing my concern is Adam Soltani, the head of the Oklahoma chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR). Soltani explained to me that Bennett's remarks had crossed the line ""from inflammatory rhetoric to a call to violence that might incite people who might not know any better."" In fact, Soltani's CAIR chapter has urged the Muslim American community in Oklahoma to take precautions after recent hate crimes were committed against Muslims in New York City. Now, saying Bennett is simply an anti-Muslim bigot wouldn't be fair. He's so much more. For example, last month when the shooting of Michael Brown by a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer was in the news, Bennett took to Facebook to express his anger. Was he upset the police shot an unarmed black teenager? Nope, he was livid that the Obama administration had sent representatives to ""this thug's funeral"" (referring to Michael Brown) and to Nelson Mandela's, but didn't do the same when certain famous white people had died. Bennett also wrote sarcastically that the police officer who shot Brown could never be innocent because he's a ""WHITE COP!"" (His capitalization.) And in July, after a federal appeals court struck down Oklahoma's constitutional amendment barring gay marriage, Bennett stated that he was ""angry"" with the decision and vowed to fight, ""to retake our freedoms from this overreaching federal government."" To Bennett, gay Americans having the freedom to marry is somehow depriving him of his own freedom. The real story though isn't a hateful elected official. We have all seen that before. The bigger development was the reaction of Oklahoma's religious and social justice groups to Bennett. Instead of dividing the community, Bennett had brought together Christian, Jewish and Muslim groups as well as organizations like the NAACP and the ACLU to stand together at a press conference to denounce Bennett and demand an apology. Rabbi Vered Harris of Oklahoma City's Temple B'nai Israel told me, ""I respect people of all religions, or no religions, who abide by America's core values of tolerance and respect. It's unfortunate that Rep. Bennett does not."" I also spoke with the president of the Oklahoma Chapter of the NAACP, Anthony Douglas, who said it was too late for Bennett to apologize, it was time for him to resign. Douglas, a Vietnam veteran, commented that Bennett is ""promoting hatred and possibly even violence against Muslim Americans with his comments and there's simply no place for that from our elected officials."" Bennett is running unopposed in this November's election. However, maybe the good people of his district will write in another candidate to replace him. Bigotry is a ""cancer that must be cut out of the American society."" A step towards achieving that dream would be defeating John Bennett on November 4.","A state representative from Oklahoma said Muslims are a 'cancer' in American society .
Dean Obeidallah says the official has been responsible for other hateful rhetoric .

"(CNN) -- A hatchet attack on New York City police officers and two back-to-back attacks on uniformed officers in Canada have raised questions about whether the incidents may have been motivated by the attackers' alignment with radical Islam. Zale H. Thompson charged at four New York police officers with a metal hatchet Thursday, hitting two of them. The attack is the third on people in uniform in North America in a week. ISIS, the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, has recently called on sympathizers in the West to carry out attacks against men and women in uniform. The move raised concerns about such attacks in both the United States and Canada. Attacks in Canada . Two attackers with some ties to radical Islam, in separate incidents, killed two men in uniform in Canada this week. On Monday, a radical convert ran down two soldiers in his car, killing one of them. Martin Couture-Rouleau, 25, then led police on a chase before his car rolled into a ditch in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, a town southeast of Montreal. He exited the car, and police opened fire on him. He died in the confrontation. On Wednesday, radical Islamist convert Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, shot and killed a soldier, Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, who was standing guard at a veterans memorial in the capital, Ottawa. Bibeau then stormed Parliament and opened fire. Kevin Vickers, sergeant-at-arms of the Canadian Parliament, and police officers fired dozens of rounds, killing Zehaf-Bibeau. No direct connection has been found between any of these men and ISIS, though both Canadian attackers had been caught attempting travel to join jihad. Zehaf-Bibeau had contact with other Canadian Islamists, authorities there have said. Official: New York case doesn't appear tied to radical Islam . Online postings attributed to Thompson paint a portrait of someone who at the very least held controversial views. For example, in a comment posted last month to an online video discussing a global caliphate, a user with the name Zale Thompson seemed to justify jihad, ""If the Zionists and the Crusaders had never invaded and colonized the Islamic lands after WW1, then there would be no need for Jihad!"" Thompson, a Muslim convert, was killed during Thursday's attack. A law enforcement official told CNN on Friday that the case doesn't look like one of radical Islam. ISIS has a draw on the disaffected and those who don't feel at home where they are, said jihad expert Richard Barrett of the Soufan Group. ""The general picture provided by foreign fighters of their lives in Syria suggests camaraderie, good morale and purposeful activity, all mixed in with a sense of understated heroism, designed to attract their friends as well as to boost their own self-esteem,"" he said. And ISIS constantly cranks the PR machine, making expert use of slick videos and social media. ISIS has, for an anti-Western organization, been surprisingly attractive to young male recruits from the West as well as to some young women. More than 100 of the foreign fighters for ISIS in Syria have come from the United States, according to intelligence estimates. Canadian authorities believe that 130 citizens are fighting in jihad. Hundreds more have gone from Europe, which is geographically closer to the fight. British authorities place the number of UK citizens fighting in Syria at 500. Thousands more come from the Middle East and Africa. More than 3,000 have joined from Tunisia, the largest single contingency. ISIS sympathies . ISIS' global digital reach has terror experts worried about security in the West, especially attacks by lone wolves who may not have any official mission from international terrorists. And incidents have cropped up to support those fears. This week, a video turned up of a 17-year-old Australian boy standing with ISIS fighters and threatening to behead Western leaders, including President Barack Obama, and then to fly the ISIS flag over the White House. And three schoolgirls from Colorado were intercepted last week at an airport in Germany as they traveled to join jihad in Syria. In September, Australian authorities interrupted a plot by ISIS sympathizers to snatch a member of the public, behead him or her and drape an ISIS flag over the corpse. Also last month, a recent convert in Oklahoma is accused of beheading a woman in his workplace after admonishing women there about the way they dressed. The company's CEO shot Anton Nolen, who survived and was taken to hospital. CNN's Shimon Procupez, Ed Payne and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","NEW: No link seen between assailant and radical Islam, senior law officer says .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Dr. Ronald Dworkin tells the story of a woman who didn't like the way her husband was handling the family finances. She wanted to start keeping the books herself but didn't want to insult her husband. Antidepressants such as Paxil, Prozac and Lexapro are among America's most-prescribed drugs. The doctor suggested she try an antidepressant to make herself feel better. She got the antidepressant, and she did feel better, said Dr. Dworkin, a Maryland anesthesiologist and senior fellow at Washington's Hudson Institute, who told the story in his book ""Artificial Unhappiness: The Dark Side of the New Happy Class."" But in the meantime, Dworkin says, the woman's  husband led the family into financial ruin. ""Doctors are now medicating unhappiness,"" said Dworkin. ""Too many people take drugs when they really need to be making changes in their lives."" For Dworkin, the proof is in the statistics. According to a government study, antidepressants have become the most commonly prescribed drugs in the United States. They're prescribed more than drugs to treat high blood pressure, high cholesterol, asthma, or headaches.  CNN's Elizabeth Cohen discusses the CDC study on antidepressants » . In its study, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at 2.4 billion drugs prescribed in visits to doctors and hospitals in 2005. Of those, 118 million were for antidepressants. High blood pressure drugs were the next most-common with 113 million prescriptions. The use of antidepressants and other psychotropic drugs -- those that affect brain chemistry -- has skyrocketed over the last decade. Adult use of antidepressants almost tripled between the periods 1988-1994 and 1999-2000. Between 1995 and 2002, the most recent year for which statistics are available, the use of these drugs  rose 48 percent, the CDC reported. Many psychiatrists see this statistic as good news -- a sign that finally Americans feel comfortable asking for help with psychiatric problems. ""Depression is a major public health issue,"" said Dr. Kelly Posner, an assistant professor at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. ""The fact that people are getting the treatments they need is encouraging."" She added that 25 percent of adults will have a major depressive episode sometime in their life, as will 8 percent of adolescents. ""Those are remarkably high numbers,"" Posner said. While Posner says genuine depression is driving the prescription numbers, Dr. Robert Goodman, an internist in New York City, says the real force behind skyrocketing antidepressant prescription rates is pharmaceutical marketing to doctors and to consumers. ""You put those two together and you get a lot of prescriptions for antidepressants,"" he said. He questions whether all those prescriptions are necessary. ""It's hard to believe that number of people are depressed, or that antidepressants are the answer,"" he said. Goodman is the founder of a group called ""No Free Lunch,"" a group that encourages doctors to reject gifts from pharmaceutical companies. He added that patients sometimes see ads for antidepressants on television and ask doctors for the drugs -- and that studies show these requests work. In a study published two years ago in the Journal of the American Medical Association, actors pretending to be patients went to doctors in the San Francisco area and said they were depressed. The ""patients"" who asked for an antidepressant were significantly more likely to get a prescription for one than patients who didn't ask for an antidepressant. ""Patients' requests have a profound effect on physician prescribing in major depression and adjustment disorders,"" concluded the study's authors. But Posner's concern is about under-prescribing, not over-prescribing. ""Fifty percent of African-Americans who have depression don't seek treatment for it,"" she said. ""Not enough people are getting the treatment they need."" E-mail to a friend . Elizabeth Cohen is a correspondent for CNN Medical News.

"Brussels, Belgium (CNN) -- Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on Friday signed a broad agreement of cooperation with the European Union, the same deal whose reversal set off a crisis in the nation. The signing came hours before the President's office announced a three-day extension of a cease-fire. This is the latest step suggesting Ukraine may be moving back from the brink of full-fledged civil war -- though the situation remains volatile, with continued violence and the constant fear of yet more, cease-fire or not. This tension has recent roots in then-President Viktor Yanukovych's decision to shun the EU Association Agreement last year and work with Russia instead. That move unleashed deadly strife that led to Yanukovych's ouster, the loss of Crimea and a pro-Russia separatist rebellion. Sealing the deal may be the second-most important moment in Ukraine's history, Poroshenko said, after its independence from Russia. He said the signing ""shows how dramatically things can change in a short time, if the will of the people is strong enough."" And he paid tribute, on what he described as a ""great day"" in the nation's history, to Ukrainians who lost their lives when protests over closer ties with Europe turned bloody. ""The document we will sign today is not just political and economic, it is a symbol of faith and unbreakable will,"" he said. ""It is a tribute to people who gave their lives and health to make this moment happen, and it is the strongest reminder that today's Europe is and must be about people's determination to live in a better and safer world."" Poroshenko said that in signing the Association Agreement, he was making a unilateral statement that his country has underlined its choice of future membership in the EU. And he signaled to Russia that its efforts to undermine the closer unification of Europe would fail in the face of Ukraine's determination to pursue its European dreams. He used the same pen intended for use in November before Yanukovych turned his back on the agreement in favor of Moscow. Russian reaction . Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Russian state TV that signing the EU deal is a ""sovereign right"" but that ""Russia will undertake its measure if its market is negatively affected"" by the agreement. Such action probably would be protective trade measures intended to shield Russian producers and industry from an influx of potentially cheaper, better-quality goods from Europe. Speaking at a Brussels news conference after the signing, Poroshenko said what was needed more than sanctions was a ""real dialogue"" with Russia. The EU and the United States have repeatedly warned Moscow that more economic sanctions could be imposed if it doesn't act to defuse the crisis. ""I really hope that finally now this dialogue will take place and we will have a real cease-fire and the implementation of my peace plan,"" Poroshenko said. Speaking in Moscow, Putin also emphasized the need for a lasting truce, according to Russia's state-run news agency ITAR-Tass. ""Ukraine should embark on the path of peace, dialogue and accord. The priority is to conduct substantial talks between the authorities in Kiev and the southeast,"" Putin is quoted as saying. ""We stand for the complete termination of bloodshed on the whole territory of Ukraine, including along our borders,"" he said, adding that Russia is doing its best to contribute to the peace process. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday called for Ukraine to carry out promised constitutional reforms and said Russia should be involved in consultations to safeguard the interests of Russian speakers in southeast Ukraine. European Council leader sees stability, prosperity . The EU-Ukraine Association Agreement calls for a free trade zone and for Ukraine to adhere to European values such as democracy and human rights. It will allow for the country to participate in common border protection and security processes. In remarks before the signing, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy also remembered those who died in Ukraine. ""In Kiev and elsewhere, people gave their lives for this closer link to the European Union,"" he said. ""We will not forget this."" Van Rompuy said that closer political and economic ties would bring greater security, stability and prosperity to Ukraine and the two other former Soviet states also each signing an EU Association Agreement on Friday, Georgia and Moldova. ""Our joint goal is your full integration into the market of the European Union,"" Van Rompuy told those countries' three leaders, adding they must push forward with reforms. He also expressed the EU's solidarity with the three nations in the face of Ukraine's ""very difficult"" security situation, and the ""uncertainties"" looming over Georgia's and Moldova's relationships with Russia. He stressed that Russia had nothing to fear from those nations' closer ties with Europe, adding the EU would engage with Moscow to work for peace. Putin -- pragmatic or emotional? As Ukraine's government works to quell the violence in the east, Poroshenko has said that negotiations with Russian separatists there will continue Friday. Peace is possible if Putin is in the right mood, he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview Thursday. ""Sometimes, the position of Mr. Putin is quite pragmatic, sometimes it is very emotional,"" Poroshenko said. ""I just try to find out the time when he is more pragmatic than emotional."" The talks are intended to end fighting that threatens to escalate into a broader conflict. ""I am optimistic and I'm thinking that within a few weeks, maybe months, we can have a deal to establish peace,"" Poroshenko said. Putin has agreed to negotiations that will include an EU representative, Poroshenko said. ""We do not expect any immediate negative reaction,"" he said. ""I'm ready to make a peace deal with anybody."" He is also ready to fight if necessary but said, ""I hate the idea not to use the last opportunity to bring the peace to the region."" Peace plan . Under his peace plan, he seeks a commitment to negotiations, the release of hostages, a mutual cease-fire and the withdrawal of Russian-backed forces from Ukraine. ""All the troops on Ukrainian territory are Russian, they are Russian citizens,"" he alleged, adding that separatist leaders were from the Russian secret service. ""If that continues, it is a real war."" Poroshenko said that Ukraine had seen 18 soldiers killed and 33 injured in the past week, while the separatists had shown ""no negotiation, no sign of compromise."" But he held out hope for last-minute negotiations Friday and said he could not yet say whether the military action against the separatists would resume. At the same time, he made clear that in his mind, the Russian annexation of Crimea -- which has an ethnic Russian majority -- cannot stand. Crimea is Ukrainian, he said. He made the same point Friday when he said that ""all Ukraine, including Crimea"" will be associated with the EU. Russia and Ukraine have been engaged in a tense standoff since the annexation in March when Russia also massed troops along its western border with Ukraine. Cease-fire extended . Poroshenko's office announced Friday a 72-hour extension of a fragile cease-fire that was declared last week. That means that, by late Monday night, the Kiev government expects that all hostages will be released, all international border checkpoints will be taken out of separatists' hands and the militants' recruiting offices in Russia will close down. At the same time, the Ukrainian government says it still reserves the right to use force in any areas where the cease-fire is not being universally accepted. In fact, there have been plenty of examples of violence since the original cease-fire was declared. On Thursday, for instance, a Ukrainian national guard base came under attack in Donetsk, Anti-Terrorist Operation unit spokesman Vladislav Seleznyov said. Ukrainian troops were able to repel the attack but braced for another assault. Two days earlier, Ukrainian authorities said pro-Russia militants shot down a military helicopter in eastern Ukraine, killing nine. Kiev and the West have accused Russia of failing to take concrete steps to ease the crisis. NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen urged Moscow this week ""to create conditions for the implementation of the peace plan, to end its support for separatist troops, and to stop the flow of weapons and fighters across its border."" Putin has shown signs of detente. At his request, Russia's upper house of parliament voted Wednesday to revoke the President's right to use troops in Ukraine. CNN's Mick Krever reported from Brussels, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported from London and Ben Brumfield from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Caramel apples are a perk of fall, and while most of us have fond childhood memories associated with this autumnal treat, one of our editors, Danielle DeSiato-Hallman, helped them grow up. Her recipe for Red-Wine Caramel Apples is a great treat for adults on Halloween. America's Test Kitchen: Candy-Coated Caramel Apples . Since this is America's Test Kitchen and we believe most things are better when you make them yourself, we make our caramel from scratch, replacing some of the standard heavy cream with reduced red wine. Not only do the coated apples develop a beautiful, reddish color, but the wine also deepens the caramel flavor and adds a hint of rich fruitiness. America's Test Kitchen: Best Baked Apples . If you prefer bourbon to Burgundy, don't despair; these treats are just as good when made with other boozy additions. We've included variations such as Bourbon-Pecan Caramel Apples, Amaretto Caramel Apples and Frangelico Caramel Apples for delicious, grown-up versions of our favorite childhood treat. Because who's to say kids should have all the fun on Halloween? America's Test Kitchen: Chocolate Shadow Cake . Red-Wine Caramel Apples . (Serves 8) We prefer Granny Smith apples for this recipe, but Braeburns and Galas are also acceptable. For individually wrapped treats, refrigerate coated apples for 4 hours before wrapping in plastic wrap and securing with a ribbon or twist tie. Apples can be stored at room temperature in an airtight container or wrapped in plastic for 1 day, or refrigerated for up to 4 days. 1½ cups red wine . 8 Granny Smith apples, stemmed, washed and dried thoroughly . 8 wooden chopsticks (4 pairs, divided) or skewers . 2 tablespoons unsalted butter . 1 cup (7 ounces) packed light brown sugar . ½ cup light corn syrup . 1 cup heavy cream . 1 teaspoon Maldon sea salt . America's Test Kitchen: Chocolate Caramel Chews . 1. Boil wine in small saucepan over medium heat until reduced to ½ cup, 8 to 10 minutes. 2. Meanwhile, line baking sheet with parchment paper or wax paper. Stand apples on baking sheet and insert chopstick or skewer into stem end of each apple. 3. Melt butter in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add brown sugar and corn syrup, and cook, stirring, until sugar is melted, about 2 minutes. Stir in ¾ cup cream, bring to boil and cook until mixture reaches 235 degrees, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and carefully stir in reduced red wine (mixture will bubble vigorously). 4. Return pan to medium-high heat and continue cooking until mixture reaches 255 degrees, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat and stir in remaining cream. Let cool until mixture reaches 200 degrees, 3 to 5 minutes. 5. Holding one apple by its chopstick, immerse apple in caramel with swirling motion, tilting pan if necessary to pool caramel deep enough to coat at least ¾ of apple. Lift apple out of caramel and hold over pan for about 10 seconds, allowing excess caramel to drip back into pan, then hold apple upside down over pan for about 15 seconds, allowing caramel to begin to set. Return to prepared baking sheet and repeat with remaining apples and caramel. If caramel cools too much and becomes too thick to evenly coat apples, briefly return pan to low heat to loosen caramel, but do not let caramel simmer again. 6. If desired, sprinkle Maldon sea salt lightly around top third of caramel. Let apples stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour before serving. For Bourbon-Pecan Caramel Apples: . Substitute ½ cup bourbon whiskey (such as Maker's Mark) for red wine and reduce to ¼ cup in step 1, 5 to 7 minutes. Continue with recipe as directed. Roll bottom third of apples in ½ cup chopped toasted pecans and ¼ teaspoon Maldon sea salt. For Amaretto Caramel Apples: . Substitute 1 cup amaretto liqueur for red wine and reduce to ½ cup in step 1, 5 to 7 minutes. Continue with recipe as directed. If desired, roll bottom third of apples in mixture of ½ cup chopped toasted almonds and ½ teaspoon Maldon sea salt. For Frangelico Caramel Apples . Substitute 1 cup Frangelico liqueur for red wine and reduce to ½ cup in step 1, 5 to 7 minutes. Continue with recipe as directed. If desired, roll bottom half of apples in mixture of ½ cup chopped toasted hazelnuts and ½ teaspoon Maldon sea salt.

"(CNN) -- Golf can be a frustrating game -- just ask Patrick Reed. The 24-year-old could be in trouble with golf's authorities after a foul-mouthed reaction to a missed putt during the WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai. Reed, who starred for America during its recent Ryder Cup defeat to Europe, was caught on camera swearing and using a term which could be deemed homophobic. After making a bogey on the 10th hole at the Sheshan International, Reed was heard to say: ""Nice f****** three-putt you f****** f****t."" Reed, who finished the opening round five shots behind leader Graeme McDowell -- his playing partner -- was quick to apologize on Twitter, but could now face sanctions. The PGA Tour has rules that govern against poor language on the course, and it said in a statement they were aware of the situation. ""The PGA Tour's Conduct Unbecoming regulations prohibit the use of obscene language on the golf course,"" it said. ""The PGA Tour will deal with this matter internally in accordance with its regulations."" Reed has enjoyed a breakthrough year in 2014, winning two events, including the WGC Cadillac Championship back in March. After that victory -- the biggest of his career to date -- Reed compared himself to 14-time major champion Tiger Woods and declared himself to be ""one of the top five players in the world."" He also caused controversy during his first appearance for the United States in its biennial team battle against Europe at the Ryder Cup, held in Scotland back in September. Reed, who was unbeaten in his four matches at the competition, shushed the galleries during one of his matches, which earned him a chorus of boos from the home supporters.

"(CNN) -- Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg will start the Brazilian Grand Prix in pole position after a breathtaking final qualifying session at Interlagos. Rosberg narrowly beat teammate and rival Lewis Hamilton in to second place on the grid after both drivers broke course records. In the end, Rosberg prevailed by just 0.033 seconds. The season has, in many ways, been defined by the bitter rivalry between, and dominance of, Rosberg and Hamilton. The former friends have locked horns, and clashed wheels, at a series of races, from Bahrain to Germany to Hungary to Belgium. But going into the penultimate race of the season, Hamilton is 24 points ahead. Most seasons this would put Hamilton in control of the championship. But not this season. Double jeopardy . The introduction of double points for the final race in Abu Dhabi has completely transformed the calculus. Neither driver can win the championship in Brazil but if Hamilton wins, and Rosberg fails to finish, double points means that the German could still steal the title from Hamilton despite being 49 points behind. ""That was good and I am happy to be on pole,"" Rosberg said in a press conference after the race. ""It is the best place to start the race, but I have to do better than I did last week in Austin and convert this into a win."" Hamilton, for his part, was gracious in defeat. ""Congratulations to Nico,"" he said. ""He drove a really great lap and it was a truly thrilling session, just what qualifying is all about. Every time I went out I had to go faster and improve and so did Nico. I hope everyone enjoyed watching that."" But the biggest cheers were reserved for the Brazilian driver Felipe Massa, who was third fastest for Williams. ""That was very emotional for me,"" Massa said. ""I really felt the crowd with me today."" Crowd sourced racing? Meanwhile, off the track, Bernie Ecclestone denied that Formula One is in the midst of a financial crisis. Last week two teams effectively went out of business. Marussia folded on Friday whilst Caterham went in to administration. Neither team had appeared at the US or Brazil races. ""People say F1 is in crisis ... absolute nonsense,"" Ecclestone told AFP. ""We've had a couple of teams in crisis. People come and go. They need to know how much is coming in and how much is going out. Maybe the major four or five teams can make a contribution for one year only."" The administrators taking charge of Caterham's financial affairs had announced an innovative plan to allow the team to race at Abu Dhabi: crowd source the necessary $3.7 million. Ecclestone, however, was not impressed. ""It's up to the fans if that's what they want to do/ Maybe people will put investment in the team,"" he said. ""I think it's a disaster.""","Nico Rosberg clinches pole for Sunday's Brazil GP.

"(CNN) -- It's well known the fashion industry is one of the toughest to break into. To conform to the traditional stereotype of a model you need to be skinny, stunning and have legs that go on forever, right? Try telling that to Refilwe Modiselle -- she's breaking all the rules while sashaying down the catwalk as Africa's first albino model. ""I was being tenacious and saying 'no, wait a minute. This is a different representation of what African beauty is,'"" Modiselle tells CNN. ""You're told that a black child should be brown-skinned, but what do you then call a girl like myself? I'm not tall either. But there I was modeling with the likes of your Adiambo's, your famous models that have really done well."" In 1999, Modiselle was just 13 years old when she was first approached to do a five-page shoot for a youth magazine aiming to showcase how the African fashion landscape would change with the turn of the millennium. It was her first taste of fashion, but she got the bug. Yet it wouldn't be until she finished her high school education and entered college (at the behest of her mother) that Modiselle found herself in front of a camera again. Redefining beauty . The move kickstarted her career and soon the South African student was staring back at herself from glossy magazine pages and gliding down runways at high-profile events, like Mercedes Benz Africa Fashion Week. ""I was defying everything about what society says defines a model. I'm basically saying 'OK, let's teach our kids a different definition of beauty, or a definition that's always been there but has just always been disregarded."" Albinism is an inherited condition caused by a lack of melanin, a pigment in skin, hair and eyes. While it is fairly common globally -- one in every 17,000 people are born with some form of the genetic disorder -- albinos across Africa are often subject to discrimination and even, in some countries, hunted and killed because of their appearance. ""People with albinism are often not given the opportunity to get into such industries because we're not known as extroverts, we're not given a chance to be identified in society as people who have the potential to represent something,"" she says. Identity crisis . But Modiselle doesn't just have to live with the unspoken threat of discrimination hanging in the air. Born in Soweto, the feisty, young model has, at times, struggled with her identity. The 28-year-old explains: ""South Africa has a history of apartheid, where race is such a big segregation. How do you then place yourself? You are a girl who is born in a black society: the township. And now you have to fit into a world where, you're told: this is black, this is white and you're in a country that is constantly fighting these aspects. It's something that is not easy because people try and place you and identify you in a specific way."" Cementing her status as a household name, she also spends one day a week filming a current affairs talk show with fellow South African television personalities Masechaba Lekalake and comedian Tol Ass Mo. Participation in the show allows Modiselle to reveal more of her personality to the country, and to show she's more than just a clothes horse. Though she's not even 30, Modiselle is already thinking about her legacy. ""I will teach through the things that I do. (My) plan for the future is just to grow myself as a brand and as an entity: to touch the world in different places and to be able to be a huge representative for Africa.""","Traditional stereotype of model is tall, skinny and aesthetically attractive .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Socks, the cat who won international fame during his years in the Clinton White House, was euthanized Friday after months of treatment for cancer. Socks was adopted by Chelsea Clinton when her father was governor of Arkansas. Socks, who was born in 1989, was put to sleep about 10 a.m. at Three Notch Veterinary Clinic in Hollywood, Maryland, said veterinary assistant Rae Dera. Veterinarians say he was probably either 19 or 20 years old. The cat had been losing weight since November and had been treated at the clinic, Dera said. He had been suffering from a cancer in his mouth and jaw. Since the Clintons left the White House in 2001, Socks had lived with Betty Currie, former President Bill Clinton's secretary. The Clintons were known to have visited Socks, and Currie, when in Washington. He had been a stray and was adopted by Chelsea Clinton, the Clintons' daughter, when Bill Clinton was governor of Arkansas. ""Socks brought much happiness to Chelsea and us over the years, and enjoyment to kids and cat lovers everywhere,"" Bill and Hillary Clinton said in a joint statement released by the William J. Clinton Foundation. ""We're grateful for those memories, and we especially want to thank our good friend, Betty Currie, for taking such loving care of Socks for so many years."" The black-and-white feline was a fixture at the White House during the Clintons' eight-year run. He was often photographed on the president's shoulder and was given free rein of the presidential residence -- showing up in photos in the Oval Office and White House press briefing room. He had his own online fan club, appeared at animal charity events and was one of the subjects of now-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's book, ""Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to the First Pets.""","Socks was euthanized after months of treatment for cancer .

"London (CNN) -- November is the season for poppies in Britain: Red paper flowers to remember those fallen in war. The tradition dates back to World War I; the paper blooms -- reminiscent of those that grew over the battlefields of Flanders -- are sold by thousands of volunteers, at train stations, in shops, and in offices. Pinned to the lapels of everyone from the man and woman in the street to news anchors and celebrities, the poppies raise money for the Royal British Legion, a charity which supports serving and former soldiers and their families. Enter the Poppy Hijab: a Muslim head scarf with the iconic poppy print, launched by the Islamic Society of Britain, and sold online by British Future, with the money going to the Poppy Appeal. The hijab was launched to commemorate Khudadad Khan, the first Muslim to receive the Victoria Cross 100 years ago. ""Of the 1.2 million soldiers, Indian soldiers that fought in World War I, 400,000 were Muslim,"" Sughar Ahmed President of the Islamic Society of Britain told CNN. ""That really hits home to me. Because that's part of my heritage. That's part of who I am."" But wearing a poppy is a sensitive issue for many British Muslims. In 2010, an extremist Muslim group set the paper flowers on fire in protest at British troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. Their act angered Britons and polarized opinion among many British Muslims. Online, the scarf has received a mixed reception, with some taking to Twitter to mock it as a test of British loyalty. Sughar Ahmed acknowledges the criticism, but reiterates that it's a choice to buy and wear the scarf, not a test. ""One thing that I think is really intrinsic to this whole debate about the poppy is that we do have a choice,"" she says. ""That, for me, is really quite significant -- because that's what people fought for. For our freedoms. So that we could have a democracy. We could have a choice. In the streets near the East London Mosque, reviews of the poppy hijab were more positive. Asked if she would consider wearing the poppy hijab, one woman in a headscarf with green flowers told CNN: ""Well, I usually wear the poppy. The red one. But a headscarf? Yeah, as long as it goes with my outfit, why not?""","Many in Britain wear paper poppies during November to remember war dead .

"La Paz, Bolivia (CNN) -- Incumbent Evo Morales declared victory in Bolivia's presidential vote Sunday. Official results have not been announced, but a national exit poll placed Morales in the lead with 61% of the votes. Victory would mean Morales, of the Movement for Socialism party, would lead the country until 2020 in his third consecutive term as President. ""We thank the Bolivian people for this new triumph,"" Morales told a crowd of cheering supporters in the Bolivian capital of La Paz, vowing to make his country the energy capital of South America. ""This democratic triumph of the Bolivian people is dedicated to all the people of Latin America and of the world who fight against capitalism and against imperialism,"" he said. ""This triumph, brothers and sisters, is dedicated to Fidel Castro (and) dedicated to Hugo Chavez, may he rest in peace."" Morales, 54, is the South American country's first indigenous President. Four other candidates were vying for Bolivia's presidency in Sunday's vote. As vote tallying began, analysts said that victory was likely for the leftist Latin American leader, given his performance in the polls before the election and Bolivia's economic growth since he took office. ""The distance between Evo Morales and the rest is so great, that obviously I don't expect a surprise,"" economic analyst Carlos Toranzo told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. ""Most voters are in favor of Morales because they want the economic boom of recent years to continue."" Morales, a former union leader for coca growers, won his first election with a campaign that promised a government focused on the needs of the country's poor. But as an ally of Chavez, opponents have accused him of using the system to concentrate power. Last year, a court ruled that he could run again, deciding that his second term in office was his first under the country's new constitution. This time around, he ran under the slogan, ""With Evo, we're doing well."" Since Morales took office, the country has seen economic growth while many of its neighbors have struggled. Last year, the GDP grew 6.5%, according to government statistics. But some Bolivians say they haven't seen the economic boom cause much of a benefit for their pocketbooks. The normally bustling streets of Bolivia's capital were quiet Sunday. Voting laws prohibit cars from driving on election day . Voters told CNN en EspaÃ±ol that security and economic issues were key as they cast their ballots. ""Bolivia has transformed impressively. I was walking on the streets, talking with the citizens, and all of them are informed. All of them want to vote,"" said Alvaro Colom, a former Guatemalan President who's heading a mission of election observers from the Organization of American States. Voting went smoothly Sunday, with no major reports of irregularities, Colom said. Morales enjoys widespread popular support at home but has run afoul of some U.S. officials with his outspoken criticisms of capitalism and U.S. drug policies. When he first ran for office, he declared himself a ""nightmare"" for the United States. In 2008, he expelled the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration from Bolivia. Last year, he kicked out the U.S. Agency for International Development, accusing the agency of meddling and conspiring against his government. He told a convention of farm workers in 2011 that he feared U.S. authorities would try to plant something on his presidential plane to link him with drug trafficking. Amid rumors that former NSA contractor Edward Snowden could be on his presidential plane last year, authorities in several European countries refused to let the aircraft land to refuel on its way from Moscow back to Bolivia. Snowden, who faces espionage charges in the United States for leaking classified documents, wasn't on the plane, but Morales had said he would be willing to give him asylum. CNN en EspaÃ±ol's Carlos Montero reported from La Paz. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet reported and wrote from Atlanta. Journalist Gloria Carrasco and CNN's Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","NEW: Evo Morales says he's dedicating his victory to Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez .

"(CNN) -- Poor Pluto. Is it or isn't it a planet? Ever since astronomer Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, discovered it on February 18, 1930, we've believed that we live in a solar system with nine planets. Then, along came the International Astronomical Union, the group that gets to name planetary bodies. In 2006, it came up with some rules for what is and is not a planet. The group decided Pluto didn't make the grade. It was demoted to a dwarf planet, leaving our solar system with just eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. The union says a planet is a celestial body (PDF) that: . 1. Orbits the sun . 2. Is round or nearly round . 3. Has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit . Pluto orbits the sun, and it's round. It got kicked out as a planet because of rule No. 3: The astronomical union said Pluto was too small to knock other space rocks out of its path as it orbits the sun. But the group's definitions -- and the public's attachment to tiny Pluto -- sparked lots of debate. On September 18, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics jumped into the debate: What is a planet? It had some experts discuss the definition of a planet and then let the audience vote. Guess what? They voted that Pluto is a planet. One person who never accepted Pluto's demotion is Alan Stern, principal investigator for the New Horizons spacecraft, the first spacecraft sent to Pluto. He said Pluto was given the boot because of its distance from the sun. ""In fact, if you put Earth where Pluto is, it would be excluded!"" Stern said. ""Any definition of planethood that excludes Earth, in any circumstance, is deeply flawed. After all, if there is any object everyone agrees is a planet, it's Earth."" And he agrees with those in the audience at that Harvard panel discussion. ""I think the public is better suited to this than astronomers, at least,"" Stern said. ""The IAU should never have pretended to have the expertise to enter into this debate. It's a matter for planetary scientists, not astronomers."" Don't forget that the other eight planets also have their differences: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are rocky; Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; and Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. ""This is really about a revolution in planetary science,"" Stern said. ""We're seeing that what we used to know about the number and variety of planets was very data limited until the mid- to late 1990s. Now we know that there are lots of types of planets."" NASA's decades-old Voyager 2 mission is a preview of new mission to Pluto . When New Horizons arrives at Pluto in July, it might not end the debate over Pluto's status as a planet, but Stern says the mission is ""going to be mind-blowing."" The spacecraft has to survive what Stern calls the ""seven weeks of suspense,"" dodging asteroids as it zips toward Pluto. Then, we'll finally get detailed, amazing photos of the tiny world. Planet or not, Pluto is finally coming into focus.","Pluto was demoted to dwarf planet in 2006 .

"Capitol Hill (CNN) -- The red wave that swept Republicans into control of the Senate led to the defeat of the last white House Democrat in the deep South on Tuesday. Georgia Rep John Barrow, a pro-gun, fiscally conservative Democrat, who was running for his sixth term, lost to Republican businessman Rick Allen. The same night that the last white Southern Democrat serving in the House lost, South Carolina elected Tim Scott, an African American Republican, to the Senate in South Carolina. Scott becomes the first African American to be elected in the South and the first to start a full term since Reconstruction. University of Georgia Political Science Professor Charles Bullock told CNN on Tuesday that thirty years ago virtually all districts in Congress from the deep south were represented by white Democrats, but with Barrow's loss ""they've become extinct."" Louisiana Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu is in a run off with Republican Rep Bill Cassidy that will be decided on December 6th. Related: 9 historic firsts of the GOP wave . Related: Scott first black senator elected in South since Reconstruction . ""Democrats have fallen about as far as they can,"" Bullock said He noted that Republicans, who took over Governorship and state legislatures, redrew House districts to elect African American Democrats to represent minority areas, they made the other districts more reliably Republican. Also as the moderate and conservative white House Democrats from the area retired, or in some cases switched parties, they were replaced by conservative Republicans. Unless Democrats take back state houses and can readjust the shape of congressional districts in the deep south, Bullock said white Democrats ""may be looking at being closed out of Congressional delegations until the 2030's."" Republicans have been hoping to knock off Barrow - who survived the 2010 tea party wave that flipped control of the House of Representatives to the GOP - for several cycles. One senior House GOP campaign strategist admitted that he was one of the toughest incumbents, and a day before the election believed the race was neck and neck. But on election night it wasn't even close -- Barrow lost to Allen 55% -45%. The Georgia Democrat regularly touted his endorsement from the National Rifle Association, and was well known for his colorful campaign commercials. One television spot that Barrow aired this fall pushed back at charges he wasn't going his job. It featured a woman who Barrow helped secure her husband's veterans benefits, declaring bluntly ""anybody who says John Barrow isn't getting things done is lying like a no legged dog."" But Barrow was not conservative enough to keep his seat. With his loss the House delegations of all of the deep southern states - Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina and Louisiana - are all composed of Republicans. Barrow frequently criticized the president and voted with House Republicans repeatedly on measures to repeal parts of Obamacare. But the National Republican Congressional Committee targeted Barrow with an ad saying he voted with the President 85% of the time. House Democratic aides said Barrow's loss demonstrates just how heavy the weight of President Barack Obama was around Democratic candidates. ""If anybody could win in the deep south, it's Barrow,"" one of these senior House Democratic leadership aides told CNN. The loss is also a warning sign for House Democrats whose caucus is dominated by liberal members representing mostly urban areas in blue states. When they captured the House in 2006, Democrats recruited moderate candidates not only in red districts in the . Deep South, but also in rural districts in North Carolina, Tennessee, and in Midwestern states like Indiana and Illinois. Democrats realize that if they want to regain the majority they will need to reach out to more centrist Democrats again. ""We can' just cede the South forever. We've got to come up with some type of strategy and look at our policies and figure out how speak to those voters in those districts,"" this Democratic aide said.","The South was once dominated by Democrats, but they are now an endangered species there .
Congressional districts have been drawn to emphasize minority votes in some areas and conservative votes elsewhere .
Rep. John Barrow was the last white Democratic congressman representing the Deep South ."
"(CNN) -- President Obama's strategy for destroying the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) appears to depend on a volley of airstrikes followed by a (currently absent) holding force of Syrian rebels and Iraqi troops. ""[T]his strategy of taking out terrorists...is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years,"" the President said. Not so fast. The reality is that the few victories against al Qaeda in Somalia, Yemen and Pakistan are not a product of U.S. air power alone, but a combination of American boots on the ground, advisers and special forces, and as importantly, years of promoting local governance and military reform. Absent such security and political initiatives, Obama's counterterrorism strategy is destined to fail. There are two critical lessons from the experiences in Somalia, Yemen and Pakistan for the war against ISIS. First, airstrikes without troops on the ground don't work. Despite innovations in air power such as advanced targeting, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, there is simply no substitute for eyes, ears and feet on the ground. With this in mind, the United States has had a presence on the ground in Somalia, Yemen and Pakistan even when the missions were strictly counterterrorism. At various times in Somalia, Yemen and Pakistan, U.S. troops have directly engaged al Qaeda, protected fellow advisers, marked targets for airstrikes, embedded with and transported local troops, and used armed drones, helicopters and gunships. And yet even after more than 500 air strikes in Somalia, Yemen and Pakistan since 9/11, U.S. troops still had to conduct high-profile raids against specific top terrorist leaders. American troops have been deployed to Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan to help train local troops, conduct operations and work closely with CIA operatives and local proxies. So boots on the ground are clearly an essential part of any counterterrorism strategy -- as long as local politicians and generals are willing to share power, promote efficiency and embrace diversity. The second lesson for defeating ISIS is that improving local governance and building pluralistic militaries is difficult, but still the best deterrent against recurring Islamic radicalism. Of course, Washington cannot fix local politics within failing states that are embroiled in decades of conflict made worse by ethnic and religious divisions. Yet progress in Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan shows that American diplomats have, albeit slowly, pushed central governments to become more inclusive and share power with the periphery, and their militaries to embrace ethnic and religious diversity. In Somalia, with the help of European and African allies, including the 22,000 well-trained and equipped African Union troops, Washington has prodded the central government to implement the ""National Stabilization Strategy,"" which is focused on promoting national and local reconciliation, facilitating tribal disputes and devolving power to local and regional administrations. Lack of governance and security is the main source of local grievances that Al-Shabaab frequently exploits. In Yemen, U.S. diplomats have offered $40 million in assistance to encourage President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi to convert the National Dialogue Conference into a sustainable peace plan for his fractured country, which will include constitutional reform. Like Somalia, Yemen is in desperate need of a strong plan for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration that devolves power to local districts and places the security forces under the rule of law, guaranteeing religious freedoms. In nuclear-armed Pakistan's northern tribal badlands, the situation is more complex but governance deficiencies are similar to Somalia's south and Yemen's east. The United States has given billions to improve local infrastructure and supported democracy. Most of the $4.4 billion in aid to Pakistan between 2010 and 2014 is conditioned on strengthening Pakistani democracy. The passage of the 18th amendment to the Pakistani constitution was a small but encouraging effort to transfer power from the center to the provinces. Moreover, in the most recent protests in Islamabad the Pakistani military has restrained from directly intervening. Besides helping improve local governance, the United States has spent years training and equipping Yemeni, Somali and Pakistani militaries, subtly encouraging ethnic diversity. In Pakistan, for example, U.S. trainers helped transform a ragtag Frontier Corps, commanded by Punjabi outsiders, into a counterinsurgency force that has several units commanded by Pashtuns. Of course, not all investments have paid off. Tribal and religious divisions continue to threaten the Somali and Yemeni armies, while the Pakistani military and intelligence services are widely seen as sympathetic to the Afghan Taliban, although troops have finally put pressure on militants in North Waziristan territory. So what does all this say about how to tackle ISIS? True, the group trumps al Qaeda and affiliates across the greater Middle East in terms of finances, numbers and territorial control. But it can be defeated. President Obama's push for more representative Iraqi government and improved vetting of Syrian rebels are steps in the right direction. But realistically the United States should be expecting to send some 4,000 to 6,000 additional U.S. service members to help gather intelligence, train Syrian rebels, revive the Iraqi Army, build a national guard, protect advisers, mark targets and conduct raids against high-profile targets. This cannot be realistically be done without U.S. troops -- and will likely take about two years. Meanwhile, U.S. diplomats should be pushing for better Iraqi governance, including ensuring all major ethnic and religious groups are represented in the Iraqi and Syrian security forces. Defeating a foe like ISIS won't be easy, and it will require political courage from the United States to follow through. But a multi-pronged commitment is absolutely necessary. This is one conflict that cannot be won from the air.","President Obama's strategy for destroying ISIS seems to rely on air strikes, writes Haider Mullick .

"(CNN) -- A weekend of back-and-forth between two governors, the federal government and a nurse about mandatory quarantines left more questions than answers. At the heart of the debate: Would such quarantines on health workers who just came back from treating Ebola patients in West Africa help prevent the spread of the virus, or would they discourage medical aid workers from helping fight the global crisis? Here's what we know about the latest Ebola policies: . Who enacted tougher rules for health workers? New York, New Jersey and Illinois say anyone returning from having direct contact with Ebola patients in West Africa will have to be quarantined for 21 days. The 21-day period marks the maximum incubation period for Ebola. Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn's office said the quarantine would be a ""home quarantine."" ""This protective measure is too important to be voluntary,"" Quinn said. When New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced their new policies on Friday, they called for hospitalization or quarantine. But on Sunday night, after debate over the policies heated up, the governors said the quarantines could be carried out at home. Cuomo, Christie clarify policy on Ebola health worker quarantines . Would home quarantines even work? Depends on which side you ask. Neither Christie nor Cuomo explained how a home quarantine would work if family members were also in the home. It's also unclear how a home quarantine would or could be enforced if the quarantined person chose to leave the house. On the other hand, the governors say something had to be done; that asking returning medical workers to voluntarily quarantine themselves hasn't worked. Public health experts say there's plenty of scientific evidence indicating there's very little chance that a random people will get Ebola, unless they are in very close contact -- close enough to touch bodily fluids -- with someone who has it. Still, there's also a sense that authorities have to do something because of Americans' fears -- rational or not -- and the belief that the country is better off safe than sorry. As Mike Osterholm, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, says, ""You want to try to eliminate not just real risk, but perceived risk."" What led up to the policies? Not long after she returned home from covering Ebola in Liberia, NBC medical correspondent Dr. Nancy Snyderman violated her voluntary quarantine in New Jersey to pick up takeout from a restaurant in October -- even after her colleague became infected. In New York, city workers scrambled to retrace the steps of Dr. Craig Spencer, who tested positive last week. He'd been on the subway and to a bowling alley, among other places. What are the concerns about such quarantines? The concerns are twofold: One, it could deter doctors and nurses from traveling to West Africa to help rid Ebola; and two, it could greatly impede the livelihoods of health care workers. ""If I lose three weeks on my return and don't get to do the work I'm supposed to do ... means this wouldn't be workable for me,"" said Dr. John Carlson, a pediatric immunologist at Tulane University. The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expressed a similar view earlier this month, arguing that stringent travel restrictions might create more problems than they solve. ""It makes it hard to get health workers in, because they can't get out,"" Dr. Tom Frieden said. ""If we make it harder to respond to the outbreak in West Africa, it will spread not only in those three countries (in West Africa hit hardest by Ebola), but to other parts of Africa and ultimately increase the risk here"" in the United States. Who would pay for the time off? Cuomo added that if employers don't pay quarantined workers for the time they are absent while under quarantine, ""the government will."" How has this affected health care workers? The same day the governors announced their tougher policies Friday, nurse Kaci Hickox arrived at Newark Liberty Airport after spending a month helping treat Ebola patients in Sierra Leone. She didn't have any symptoms and tested negative for Ebola. Nonetheless, the nurse from Kent, Maine, was holed up inside a quarantine tent at University Hospital in Newark over the weekend. She was released from the hospital Monday, according to her attorney, and will return to Maine. ""This is an extreme that is really unacceptable, and I feel like my basic human rights have been violated,"" Hickox told CNN's Candy Crowley on ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. She slammed Christie for describing her as ""obviously ill."" ""First of all, I don't think he's a doctor. Secondly, he's never laid eyes on me. And thirdly, I've been asymptomatic since I've been here,"" Hickox said. Is Hickox's quarantine unconstitutional? Attorney Stephen Hyman said there's a ""legal basis"" to challenge the quarantine policies in New Jersey and in New York, but the nurse isn't sure she wants to do so. Christie said he was glad that Hickox had been released and defended his actions. ""The reason she was put in the hospital in the first place was because she was running a high fever and was symptomatic. If you live in New Jersey, you're quarantined in your home. ""That's always been the policy. If you live outside the state, and you're symptomatic, we're not letting you go onto public transportation. It makes no common sense. The minute she was no longer symptomatic, she was released,"" the governor said. Hickox said she has nothing to recover from. Her temperature is normal, and she feels fine. Who else might amp up Ebola rules? Florida is starting mandatory monitoring for all travelers returning from West Africa, and Virginia is following suit. ""Virginia will implement an active monitoring program on Monday for all returning passengers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with a special emphasis on returning health care workers,"" said Virginia governor spokesman Brian Coy. Cuomo says he knows some people probably think he's overreacting. ""We're staying one step ahead,"" the governor said. ""Some people will say we are being too cautious. I'll take that criticism because that's better than the alternative."" Isn't there a middle ground? There is. One possibility is to have those travelers go through more than just temperature checks. Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of Columbia University's National Center for Disaster Preparedness, says one such measure could be checking daily for decreases in white blood cell counts or platelets -- which could be, but aren't necessarily, a sign of an Ebola infection. And Osterholm thinks there should be stricter controls on what a person who arrives from West Africa does in his or her first three weeks in the United States. For instance, he thinks such a person shouldn't take public transportation or go to crowded places like bowling alleys -- both of which officials say Spencer did before he was symptomatic. CNN's Elizabeth Cohen, Ray Sanchez, Sara Fischer, Joe Sutton and Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.","NEW: A nurse who was quarantined at a hospital in New Jersey is released .

"(CNN) -- I've just returned from a visit to Tanzania with the global health and development organization Population Services International to better understand the challenges facing health workers in the developing world. The outbreak of Ebola only underscores the dire need for trained health workers -- a global shortage of nearly 7.2 million health workers, according to the World Health Organization. About half of the spending on health care in Africa goes to private providers and care can be unregulated and quality inconsistent. During my week on the ground, however, I met PSI community health workers, nurses, doctors and business owners who deliver controlled and quality health care across Tanzania. PSI has ensured quality care by applying proven commercial franchising strategies -- think McDonalds or Subway -- to health care. PSI operates a franchise network that spans 31 countries and serves 10 million people every year. In Tanzania, the franchise is called Familia. Lucy, a Familia community health worker, goes out into the community every day and educates women about family planning and other health issues. Lucy then refers these women back to the neighborhood Familia clinic located right in the village she serves. I joined Lucy for a session she organized at a modest apartment building with a few rooms separated by concrete walls and colorful fabric curtains. When I climbed the stairs to the front porch, about a dozen women with babies who were seated on straw mats greeted me. Lucy began to talk with them about their contraception options, and they had lots of questions for her. The most vocal was a gregarious woman named Sophia. Sophia had used condoms and pills to space her births, but when Familia began offering longer-term methods like implants, she switched. The implant prevents pregnancy for up to three years, and she shared with us how it was a great weight off her shoulders. She told the group that she wanted to be able to plan her family size, so she and her husband could save for the future. Lucy reiterated that for women like Sophia, access to family planning is a key to health and economic stability. According to a report by the United Nations Population Fund and Guttmacher Institute, returns on investment in contraception can be recouped four times or more by reducing the need for public spending on social services. This is something Lucy knows well -- before she ended the session, she gave out vouchers to our new friends for a consultation at their local Familia clinic. After the session, we walked back to the clinic together and Lucy introduced me to Dr. John -- the clinic owner and care provider. He's the kind of doctor anyone would want: one with a gentle bedside manner who cares deeply for the community he serves. We talked about the clinic, his needs and the number of clients he sees -- up to 200 per day. Dr. John said what he most needed was better business management skills. He was most appreciative about that component of PSI's franchise model -- the ongoing training he and his staff receive. This helps him retain employees -- a major problem in developing countries underscored by this most recent epidemic -- and maintain a standard of care his clients can trust. The Familia franchise incorporates 260 private health facilities across 16 regions in Tanzania. PSI establishes the quality standards that clinics in the network, like Dr. John's, must meet. And prices for products and services are set based on people's ability and willingness to pay. With this structure, the health facilities can reach the very poor with free services and those who can afford to pay something with reduced fees. It's working and clients are happy with the services they receive. According to PSI's study of the Familia Network, the client retention rate is 81%. From 2009 to 2011, Familia health workers provided 45,000 IUDs and 14,000 implants to women who wanted a long-lasting method of contraception -- which equals 143,000 years of protection from unintended pregnanc y for Tanzanian couples. This innovative model takes an unregulated sector with varying degrees of quality and standardizes the level of care. It provides the vital infrastructure necessary for a woman like Sophia to take care of herself and her family, and a doctor and business owner like John to earn a decent living. As we left, I asked Dr. John if his future plans included opening a few more clinics. He smiled, and simply said, ""That's my dream.""","Mandy Moore: Ebola underscores the need for trained health workers in Africa .

"(CNN) -- Sun, wind and water now rule an area that was once polluted and derelict. In the Swedish city of Malmo, an old shipyard has been converted from industrial wasteland to spotless eco-district, setting a world class example for sustainable living. The area started becoming commercially defunct in the late 80s. Shipping facilities have since been replaced with homes, shops and office buildings whose energy needs are met solely with renewable sources. The project is called 'Bo01 - City of Tomorrow' and it was started in 2001, to meet the demands of a growing section of the Swedish population who wanted to change the world through a commitment to live more sustainably, and were willing to make sacrifices to do so. ""It was a challenge for the future,"" explains Eva Dalman from the Bo01 architectural team. ""Bo01 was the answer to the question, how could solve the biggest environmental problem, global ones, in a sustainable city development without making those sacrifices?"" The answer came in a mix of architectural design, aesthetics and recycling in an underused land area wedged between the city and the sea. Across the old shipyard, a wind turbine now provides most of the electricity needed for the town, footpaths and cycle tracks have priority, water is drained through a series of ponds, channels and moss-covered rooftops, and geothermal reservoirs underground provide heat in winter and cool air in summer. Food waste is converted to biogas, and then used to run the local buses. Sweden has been using biomethane for transport for nearly a decade, and other countries -- mostly in Europe -- are embracing the idea. Even the occurrence of storms is not feared, but instead harnessed for water collection. In a paper published in the Journal of Green Building, Gary Austin from the University of Idaho heralds the accomplishments made by the project but acknowledges that the energy efficiency of the Bo01 buildings didn't meet their goals and the on-site biodiversity achieved mixed results. But the experts hope to feed these successes into the next generation of projects across Malmo. Bo01 has since blossomed into a larger development now known as the Western Harbour and the entire city plans to be carbon neutral by 2030. ""We learned a lot from Bo01,"" says Christer Larsson, Director of city planning in Malmo. ""We are reflecting on what we did and why it was as good as it was."" The experimental principles of this project are now being applied in other cities, like Tangshan in China, as part of an eco-district currently under construction that will span over 30 square kilometers. What began as a small, ambitious project, has set a global precedent and the future of industrial wastelands could be significantly greener. Read more from Future Cities: .

"Washington (CNN) -- Don't look for President Barack Obama to get much political kudos for America's humming job creation engine. The jobless rate is steady at 5.8 percent, the stock market's roaring, the housing market is stirring and the rescued auto industry is motoring. Gas is down to $2.71 a gallon, according to an American Automobile Association average, leaving a little extra cash for families this Christmas. New Labor Department figures out Friday show unemployment at a six-year low, and the economy shattered expectations by pumping out more than 320,000 jobs last month in the biggest hiring splurge in three years. Related: 2014 is best year for jobs numbers since 1999 . Obama had to suffer through months of grim jobs numbers in his first term, but had a spring in his step after Friday's Labor Department report. No wonder he turned the White House event at which he announced his new nominee to head the Pentagon into an opportunity to crow about jobs. ""So far this year, over the first 11 months of 2014, our economy has created 2.65 million jobs,"" he said. ""That's more than in any entire year since the 1990s.Â Our businesses have now created 10.9 million jobs over the past 57 months in a row.Â And that's the longest streak of private sector job growth on record."" Or as Brad Woodhouse, President of progressive group Americans United for Change put it on Twitter: ""321K jobs. 50 straight months of job creation. Thank you @BarackObama."" But don't waste too much time looking for credit for the President. He has a political problem, however well the economy does. Most Americans by now have decided whether they like him or not. So even if the economy roars, his approval ratings are unlikely to soar. Despite steering out of the worst slump since the 1930s, which was destroying 700,000 jobs a month, Obama still gets a thumbs down from Americans on the economy, to the frustration of many inside the West Wing. His approval numbers are stuck in the mid-to-low 40s and a CNN/Opinion Research Poll last month found 53% of Americans disapprove of how he's handling the economy. It's simple. Many people just don't feel their lives are getting better. Seventy-eight percent of voters in November's mid-term elections were worried about the direction of the economy in the next year, according to exit polls. Only 32 percent said it was getting better. ""Has there been more employment since the economic crisis? The answer is yes,"" said Lance Roberts of STA Wealth Management. ""What we have got to talk about is the quality of the employment."" While the economy is pumping out hundreds of thousands of jobs a month, it's barely keeping up with population growth. Many new jobs are coming in the service sector, in restaurants and bars for instance, where work is often part-time, low paid and lacks benefits that give people economic security. Paul Harrington, of the Center for Labor Markets and Policy at Drexel University, said growth in traditional blue collar jobs that once anchored the middle class, in industries like the building trade, is bouncing back too slowly. ""We would have expected at this stage of the recovery, construction payrolls rebounding a lot better than they have,"" said Harrington. There's also excess supply in the production sector which includes food manufacture and work with raw materials like coal and wood. That goes a long way to explaining why middle class voters in Midwestern, industrial and Southern states lashed out at Democrats in November. Those voters may also shape the 2016 presidential race as mid-term exit polls showed that the economy was easily the most important issue, despite a campaign overtaken by Obamacare, Ebola and ISIS. Jobs data also shows many Americans still struggling in the shadows. The Labor Force Participation rate, measuring those who have a job or are looking for one, was stuck near 36-year lows in November. Hourly wages are stagnant. ""Middle-class families across the country, including my home state of Ohio, are struggling to get by on wages that haven't kept pace with rising costs,"" said Republican House Speaker John Boehner on Friday, blaming Obama for suffocating a quicker recovery by burdening the economy with ""massive"" regulations and rising health care premiums. Democrats complain the GOP has blocked every job creation plan Obama has offered for years. Long term trends like the loss of manufacturing jobs overseas and new technology that wipes out manual jobs will also shape how people feel about the economy for years to come. But, there is some hope. Consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Western Michigan index, was at its highest level since the recession in November. Democratic voters are meanwhile more upbeat on the economy than Republicans, according to the Gallup survey. That suggests people decide on how the economy is doing depending on who lives in the White House. But Obama can console himself with one thought: history is more likely to look more kindly on his economic recovery than those who lived through it.","Economy shatters expectations, pumps out 321,000 jobs in November .

"(CNN) -- Nadine Gordimer, the Nobel Prize-winning South African author and anti-apartheid activist, died Sunday, her family said Monday. She was 90. Gordimer died peacefully in her sleep, according to a statement from her family. She was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1991. Her literary works, including ""A Guest of Honour"" (1970), the Booker Prize-winning ""The Conservationist"" (1974) and ""July's People"" (1981) were cited by the Nobel committee as ""giving profound insights into the historical process (and) help(ing) to shape this process."" The Nelson Mandela Foundation, calling her ""South Africa's grande dame of literature,"" responded to her death in a news release. ""We have lost a great writer, a patriot and strong voice for equality and democracy in the world,"" said professor Njabulo Ndebele, the foundation's chairman. Mandela, the former South African President who died last December, was a friend of Gordimer's and read her books while incarcerated. In her novels, essays and other works, Gordimer was one of the leading voices against South Africa's apartheid system, which segregated black and white people and led to decades of unrest. Three of her novels, including ""Burger's Daughter"" (1979), were banned by the government -- a reaction she fully expected, given their subject matter. ""I knew 'Burger's Daughter' would be banned because I even put in it ... sometimes scattered little pamphlets in the street, you know, which were swept up. But I always picked these things up, and I think I put one almost in its entirety in the book, so that would be enough for it to be banned. What else could you do?"" she said in a 2009 interview. ""Burger's Daughter"" was about the child of a white anti-apartheid activist who had died in prison after attempting to overthrow the government. It includes a description of the 1976 Soweto uprising. However, she told fellow author Justin Cartwright that her works weren't about politics, but about people. ""To be a writer is to enter into public life. I look upon our process as writers as discovery of life,"" she told him in 2012. Indeed, Gordimer was as praised for her writing ability as she was for her stand on issues. Her literary voice ""is as clear and crisp as Jane Austen's,"" wrote The Telegraph's Peter Florence. ""Her eye for the betraying detail, for the physical sensations of African heat and dust, reminds you of the great masters of location: Mark Twain's Mississippi or Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez's Macondo."" Nevertheless, she never shrank from speaking her mind. In recent years, she had criticized what is known as the ""Secrecy Bill,"" which gave the government great leeway to decide what information should be protected, as well as to prosecute violators. The bill, though approved by South Africa's parliament in 2013, wasn't signed by President Jacob Zuma, who returned it to the legislature. Gordimer was born in South Africa in 1923, the daughter of Jewish immigrants. She was a thoughtful observer from a young age, noting the inequities of South African society while attending an all-girls, all-white Catholic school. ""I early on began to realize how artificial our life was,"" she said. But despite her recognition of societal problems, she said she was sometimes reluctant to speak up herself. When pondering ""Burger's Daughter,"" she thought the topic would be better handled by a veteran of activist families. ""I waited a long time to do it, because I thought, I am not in this,"" she said. ""I'm neither a parent nor a child. I'm waiting for somebody to write it who would know more about it than I did. ""Nobody did, so I did."" Gordimer was married twice. Her second husband, Reinhold Cassirer, to whom she was married for 47 years, died in 2001. She is survived by two children.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Tensions in the West Bank are heightened after the recent death in an Israeli prison of a 30-year-old Palestinian arrested last week. Arafat Jaradat died Saturday, inciting Palestinian officials to once again decry conditions in Israeli prisons. ""The prisoner martyr Jaradat went to prison to come back a corpse, but we are determined to find out how it was done and who did it,"" Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said Monday, according to the state news agency WAFA. ""We know how we will act, and we will not let them (Israelis) drag us to their square, and they should bear the responsibility."" The United Nations weighed in Monday, calling for a thorough probe into Jaradat's death. ""The United Nations expects the autopsy to be followed by an independent and transparent investigation into the circumstances of Mr. Jaradat's death, the results of which should be made public as soon as possible,"" Robert Serry, the U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, said in a written statement. Israel said doctors had worked to save the inmate, who was suffering from previous injuries. Palestinian officials said Jaradat was tortured. Palestinians in Israeli prisons -- about 4,500 people -- took part in a hunger strike Sunday, and crowds protested in the streets of the West Bank as Palestinian officials called for an international investigation into an inmate's death. Palestinian officials told CNN that Jaradat is the 203rd Palestinian to die in Israeli prisons since 1967. He was buried Monday near his home in the West Bank as dozens of masked members of al-Aqsa Martyr's Brigade -- the armed wing of Fatah -- fired rifles in the air in protest. ""They killed him only in five days,"" his sister told Palestinian TV. ""They kidnapped him from life. Oh, my dear little brother! Oh, my love!"" A Palestinian official sent a warning Sunday to U.S. President Barack Obama, who plans to make his first trip to Israel as president next month. ""If President Obama wants to visit the region peacefully, he should exert pressure on Israel to release the prisoners -- especially the ones who are on hunger strike -- or else he will visit while Palestine is on fire,"" Minister of Prisoner Affairs Issa Qaraqe said. Israeli officials Sunday called on the Palestinian Authority to calm the territories, where there have been large protests in recent days over the conditions of Palestinian prisoners. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's liaison with Palestinians, Yitzhak Molco, passed on the demand for calm to the Palestinian Authority, Israeli government officials said. Jaradat's death came amid a fury -- and a series of questions -- surrounding the death of a prisoner in 2010, referred to as ""Prisoner X."" Details came to light in recent days after a court document was released. Jaradat had been held for interrogation since Monday for a 2011 incident in which an Israeli citizen was injured by rock-throwing Palestinian protestors. Jaradat confessed, Israeli security sources said. Human Rights Watch called on Israel on Saturday to ""immediately charge or release Palestinians detained without charge or trial for prolonged periods."" Palestinian prisoners in Israeli detention are one of many flashpoints in the Middle East conflict. Prisoners have launched hunger strikes in the past in hopes of bringing attention to their cause and pushing Israel to ease conditions or allow some prisoners to leave. Israeli officials have said that prisoners include members of extremist groups who have ""blood on their hands."" In October 2011, Israel freed more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners -- including hundreds serving life sentences for attacks on Israelis -- in exchange for one person: Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who had been held by Hamas for more than five years. ""The United Nations appeals for maximum restraint by all parties to prevent further violence. The United Nations will continue engaging with the parties on the ground with a view to finding a solution that addresses the plight of prisoners and preserves the calm,"" Monday's U.N. statement said. CNN's Kareem Khadder reported from Jerusalem; Steve Almasy wrote the story in Atlanta.","Arafat Jaradat had been detained for five days when he died .

"(CNN) -- Airstrikes against ISIS militants are a ""psychological operation,"" not a military one, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an interview that aired Friday. ""It is a common threat for all of us,"" he said. ""And this requires a unison effort from all of us."" ""We need a vast campaign of operations ... the aerial bombardment campaign is mostly, I would say, a form of theater, rather than a serious battle against terrorism."" Iran and the United States have found their foreign policies surprisingly aligned in the past several months, as both try to beat back the advance of the Sunni extremists that have gained a foothold in Iraq and war-torn Syria. While the United States has limited itself thus far to airstrikes in those two countries, Iran has sent Revolutionary Guard units into Iraq; the head of the Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force, Qassem Suleimani, has even been photographed on the ground in Iraq. Five Gulf countries, traditional adversaries of Shiite Iran, joined with the United States in a rare coalition to strike ISIS in Syria. However, Rouhani said he'd like to distance himself ""from the word 'coalition' because some countries haven't come together under the umbrella of this coalition."" The question of Syria . Many of the countries participating in the coalition have long pushed for the ouster of Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad, as the Emir of Qatar told Amanpour on Thursday in his first-ever interview. Iran, on the other hand, is al-Assad's most fervent backer; most military analysts agree that the regime would have fallen long ago were it not for Iran's 2012 intervention in the conflict. ""How do you feel,"" Amanpour asked Rouhani, ""as the president of Iran, as the main military backer of a regime, the Assad regime, that the United Nations has said has killed 200,000 of its own people -- tortured people, executed people. Why does Iran want to be associated with that kind of genocidal barbarism?"" ""The army of that country was carrying out a battle against the terrorists,"" Rouhani replied. ""They kept saying that these are opposition members and we will keep asking who are these opposition members who have preferred to take up arms so swiftly and so savagely and violent, reasons rather than resorting to talks and negotiations?"" Amanpour countered that ""it all started when (the Syrian people) wanted a little bit of reform and the government of that nation responded in a way that the United Nations now says has caused the death of 200,000 civilians."" ""If the army of the Syrian people, the Syrian government, had not stood up and fought against terrorism,"" Rouhani said, ""who do you think would have been the victor today? Let's assume no one would have rendered assistance. The victor would have been the same people that everyone is recognizing as terrorists today."" 'Justice will be employed' Amanpour also asked the Iranian leader about the detainment this summer of a high-profile journalist for the Washington Post, Jason Rezaian, and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi. Would Rouhani, as a gesture of goodwill, release them from custody, along with several others who have been detained, including an English-Iranian woman, Ghoncheh Ghavami, and the American Amir Hekmati, Amanpour asked. ""We never wish for any individuals, Iranian or non-Iranians, be it in Iran or in other countries, to be imprisoned or detained or be put on trial,"" he said. ""If they do go to trial, the trial will be fairly executed for them to have access to every legal defense allowed under the law, proper defensive representation through qualified attorneys, and we do hope that their families can gain the certainty that fairness and justice will be employed towards the cases and case files of their loved ones."" The President also noted that Iran does not recognize dual citizenship, so anyone with an Iranian passport is considered Iranian only by the government. ""I do not believe that an individual would be detained or put in prison for being a journalist. An individual can be a reporter, a journalist, and have committed a crime. But that crime is not necessarily always related to their profession, to the profession that they're practicing."" ""My personal opinion is, and I've announced it several times when I've spoken on different occasions, we believe that the general behavior towards reporters and journalists and those who carry the heavy weight of informing our citizenry, must be quite flexible."" ""The truth of the matter is that I cannot have the time nor the inclination nor access to every single case file. But what I must... be assured of as the chief executive of my branch is that the constitution and the laws and the civil rights are being respected to the letter."" Nuclear negotiations . Iran continues to be part of intense negotiations with the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany over its nuclear program. In an effort to reach a permanent deal that would trade nuclear guarantees for the reduction of sanctions, world powers agreed earlier this year to extend the interim agreement that provided the framework for negotiations. That interim deal, Rouhani said, is ""concrete proof that talks and negotiations succeed."" ""We must all accept that there is only one way and that's the way of dialogue and talks and negotiations,"" he told Amanpour. ""This means that sanctions are an inappropriate tool. That means that threats are the wrong path."" Both Iran and its negotiating partners are discussing the issues with the ""utmost seriousness,"" he said. ""There are still differences of opinion. Some of these differences of opinion can be quite significant. But at the end of the day, we must all strive to find a solution and resolve this."" Right now there's a November deadline to reach a permanent solution, after which the temporary sanctions relief and enrichment freezes would be lifted. Rouhani said that for now, Iran is only thinking about reaching that deal, not about another extension. Even if a deal is agreed upon, various legislative bodies -- most importantly the U.S. Congress -- would still have to approve the lifting of sanctions. Amanpour asked whether it had been fully made clear to him how difficult that process could be. ""That's their own business, quite frankly,"" the President said. ""I do think that if the agreement is reached, it can immediately cease and melt away -- take away these sanctions."" 'Our people realize... we have taken steps forward' Rouhani, through his office, is a prolific user of Twitter. But the platform remains off-limits to most Iranians, who must use technical workarounds to access the service. In an interview with Amanpour last year, Rouhani said that all of his efforts were ""geared to ensure that the people of Iran will comfortably be able to access all information globally and to use it."" As the Iranian President spoke at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, the CEO of Twitter, Dick Costello, sent out a tweet. ""Mr. President, enjoying your Tweets from the UN,"" Costello wrote. ""We would love the Iranian people to enjoy them as well. When will that be?"" Amanpour asked Rouhani for his reaction. ""It is correct we have not yet reached a point in which we feel completely comfortable in what our people intended during the elections and voted for."" ""But our people realize that we have taken steps forward. And our people are fully aware that in such matters, we must have a coordination with other branches of the government -- with the judiciary, with the parliament, with the legislatures"" -- a seeming reference to the fact that others in the Iranian government may not be as keen to open up the Internet as he is. ""What is important to keep in mind is that we've had sustainable movement forward throughout the past 12-plus months.""","Iran has sent Revolutionary Guards to Iraq to fight against ISIS .

"(CNN) -- Barry Kluger was playing a round of golf with a friend on April 6, 2001, when he received news of the kind every parent fears: His 18-year-old daughter, Erica, had been in a car crash. ""What they didn't tell me is she'd been dead an hour,"" said Kluger of Scottsdale, Arizona. Twenty minutes after receiving the call, Kluger was at the emergency room talking to a grief counselor. ""A few weeks later, I went to thank the firemen who tried to save her,"" he said. ""They told me she never knew what hit her."" Kluger said he cannot begin to imagine the pain that the loved ones of the victims from Friday's Colorado theater mass shooting are experiencing. ""It was so violent and there was no reason, no cause for it,"" he said. ""Those who lost spouses, siblings, boyfriends and girlfriends -- they're going to spend the next few years and most of their lives trying to make sense out of something that makes no sense."" Victims of massacre remembered with poignant stories . Kluger believes that getting bereavement and trauma experts to victims' families is the best support possible. When his daughter died, Kluger was running his own company, and could take personal time to grieve. However, extended time off is not a reality for many Americans. ""People have sent me their stories,"" Kluger said. ""One woman lost a child and her boss showed up at the funeral and said, 'I'll see you at work on Monday.'"" In January 2011, Kluger partnered with another grieving father, Kelly Farley, to draft a proposed amendment to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the current act ""entitles eligible employees of covered employers to take unpaid, job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons."" Three months of leave is allowed for the birth of a child or to care for a sick family member, among other things. Yet the death of a loved one is not covered by the act. A weekend at grief camp: 'It's never going to be the same' ""You have 12 weeks off to have a child,"" Kluger said, ""but three days off when a child dies. It doesn't make any sense."" In summer 2011, after receiving letters from Montanans who had also signed Kluger's initiative, Sen. John Tester, D-Montana, proposed the Parental Bereavement Act, which would amend the Family and Medical Leave Act to incorporate extended, job-protected leave for the loss of a child. ""The senator was struck by it and, like most people, surprised the law wasn't already taken care of,"" said a spokesman from Tester's office. ""We want to see it pass but we don't have a lot of time left this year."" The average bereavement leave for a person who loses a child is three days, according to Dr. Joanne Cacciatore, a researcher at Arizona State University and the founder of the MISS Foundation, which provides support to grieving families. Cacciatore has been studying the emotional, social, cognitive, and economic impact of child death on individuals, families and society for almost 20 years. ""The death of a child is one of the most traumatic experiences a human being can endure,"" Cacciatore said. ""I cannot express to you how incredibly devastating this is to people."" Experts like Cacciatore explain that without giving parents sufficient time to grieve for their loss, companies and corporations will pay for it in the long run. Researchers at the Grief Recovery Institute, a nonprofit foundation, measured how situations like death and divorce affect U.S. businesses. According to Russell Friedman, executive director of the institute, the current estimated annual loss due to reduced productivity as an aftereffect of grief is around $225 billion. ""When someone we love dies, we lose the ability to concentrate or focus,"" Friedman said. ""Your brain doesn't work right when your heart is broken. That's why businesses lose money."" Three months for bereavement leave is a more realistic standard than three days, according to Cacciatore. After 12 weeks, ""people are usually past the stage of being stunned and paralyzed by the loss,"" she said. ""Now they can understand what this loss means."" While a person can take extra time off for mental health reasons, Cacciatore said this creates an ethical dilemma. If someone needs to mourn, having to declare depression for time off work is an unnecessary label that could also affect future employment opportunities. ""Grief is not a mental illness. It is a normal response,"" she said. A walk to pound grief into the ground .","Barry Kluger has heard from parents who don't get time to grieve .

"(CNN) -- You can now get college credit for watching all those cat videos. The University of Pennsylvania is offering a class next semester titled ""Wasting time on the Internet,"" in which students will ""focus on the alchemical recuperation of aimless surfing into substantial works of literature."" ""Students will be required to stare at the screen for three hours, only interacting through chat rooms, bots, social media and listservs,"" according to the course description on the school's website. Sign us up! Yahoo tech columnist Alyssa Bereznak notes that the course is taught at the Ivy League school by poet and professor Kenneth Goldsmith. The class is a required seminar for those of the English creative writing track and an elective for other English majors. ""In practice, the course will play out a little like this: Students will spend a lot of time chatting with friends, watching YouTube videos, surfing Facebook, exploring Reddit, and, who are we kidding, skimming UPenn-specific BuzzFeed lists,"" Bereznak writes. ""Eventually, however, they'll have to take the detritus from that time wasted -- tweets, posts, photos, browser history, a painkiller prescription for their carpal tunnel -- and turn it into 'substantial works of literature.' "" Goldsmith told Motherboard's Jason Koebler that he wants his students to be distracted, dividing their time between multiple devices including phones, tablets and laptops. ""I'm very tired of reading articles in the New York Times every week that make us feel bad about spending so much time on the Internet, about dividing our attention so many times,"" Goldsmith said.

"(CNN) -- Hong Kong's pro-democracy demonstrators are but the latest freedom group to be abandoned by the Obama administration. The pattern was set in President Barack Obama's first year in office, when he committed his initial major foreign policy error by refusing to support pro-democracy demonstrators in Iran. And, although we didn't know it at the time, it was to be the administration's original sin, an early predictor of things to come. Indeed, time and again, this White House has shown itself to be allergic to those peacefully seeking backing for their freedom causes. Whether Cuban, Chinese, Iranian or Venezuelan, dissidents who regularly make the rounds of the halls of power in Washington privately complain that even when the White House and the State Department receive them, the official is of low stature and the support is tepid. And so when tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Hong Kong last weekend, the administration ran true to form. Our consulate there expressed support for general rights such as freedom of expression, religion and association, but was signally quiet on democracy. In fact, the consulate seemed to go out of its way to wash its hands of the demonstrations, saying: ""We do not take sides in the discussion of Hong Kong's political development, nor do we support any particular individuals or groups involved in it. ... We encourage all sides to refrain from actions that would further escalate tensions, to exercise restraint and to express views on (Hong Kong's) political development in a peaceful manner."" The protesters' official Twitter feed was quick to express bitter disappointment: ""Once again, democratic govs are not speaking up for democracy. Here is US consulate's mealy-mouthed statement."" Why has the Obama administration been so slow to embrace freedom-seeking protesters? Three main reasons spring to mind: . We're not Bush: President Obama's aversion to his predecessor's policies is clear not just in his snide condescension, but also in his actions. President George W. Bush's embrace of what he called ""the freedom agenda"" appears to be enough to damn the whole project and for Obama to want to do the opposite. Pretensions to realism: Despite the fact that failures are piling up, the Obama administration apparently sees itself as really good at international relations. As such, it appears to be under the impression that it is pursuing cold-eyed national security interests and, as the ""only adults in the room,"" has no time for idealism. Liberty is not the progressives' thing: Though it receives little attention, progressivism's well-known preference for centralized control over what it sees as ""unplanned chaos"" must play a role. Progressives mock ""liberty"" here at home, so why would they take to it overseas? It is no coincidence that, very early on in her role as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton elevated climate change and gender issues over freedom in her dealings with foreign officials. Some of the White House's most thoughtful defenders point out that it is counterproductive to support pro-democracy groups, whether in Tehran or Hong Kong. But this ignores the fact that tyrants will do what they want to do, whether we support protesters or not -- the bloodily suppressed Iranian protests back in 2009 underscore this point. What foreign liberty-seekers want from us is often not ""boots on the ground,"" much less ""nation-building."" They desire moral validation of their cause, the knowledge that an outside power -- the world's only superpower, no less -- stands by them and believes in their cause. The Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, for example, has written vividly of what it meant to those in the Gulag to hear that President Ronald Reagan had called the Soviet Union evil: . ""This was the moment. It was the brightest, most glorious day. Finally a spade had been called a spade. Finally, Orwell's Newspeak was dead. ... It was one of the most important, freedom-affirming declarations, and we all instantly knew it."" Support for freedom overseas has been America's official policy at least since Truman announced his doctrine to Congress, saying that, with Britain exhausted and its empire fading, we had to step up. ""One of the primary objectives of the foreign policy of the United States,"" Truman said, ""is the creation of conditions in which we and other nations will be able to work out a way of life free from coercion."" But it goes back much earlier, and the founders understood we were to hold the torch of freedom for the rest of the world to see. When we don't, it creates not just disappointment in places like Hong Kong, but dissonance here at home.","White House has shunned people protesting for freedom, argues Mike Gonzalez .
Tyrants will do what they want to do, whether we support protesters or not, Gonzalez says .
What foreign liberty-seekers want from us is moral validation of their cause, he writes .

"(CNN) -- Bristol County, Massachusetts, prosecutors have dropped charges against an 18-year-old man accused of raping a 17-year-old girl in July at a Keith Urban concert south of Boston. ""Given the state of the evidence, the case was dismissed in the interest of justice,"" said Gregg Miliote, a spokesman for the Bristol County district attorney. Sean Murphy was charged with rape after an incident that happened in front of a large crowd on the lawn of the Xfinity Center, an outdoor amphitheater in Mansfield, Massachusetts, on July 26. Multiple people recorded what happened on their cell phones and provided video to authorities for their investigation. Murphy entered a not guilty plea in court and was released on $10,000 bond. His attorney had always maintained his client's innocence. ""Put simply, this was a consensual act, not a sexual assault,"" lawyer Steven Brooks said at the time. ""This was a private act that regrettably occurred in a public place."" ""Mr. Murphy deeply regrets this incident and I am sure the young woman does as well. The young woman was neither intoxicated nor overcome by drugs at the time. Mr. Murphy has no criminal history whatsoever."" Fans hospitalized after 'nutso' Keith Urban concert . About 18,000 people attended the concert in Mansfield, about 30 miles south of Boston. More than 20 people were hospitalized after the concert, police said. Another 50 were taken into protective custody, and several others were arrested over ""alcohol-related issues,"" local authorities said. ""In total, fire and EMS attended to 46 medicals resulting in 22 transports mostly alcohol-related,"" Mansfield Police Chief Ron Sellon and Fire Chief Neal Boldrighini said in a joint statement.

"(CNN) -- Anita Mills was 382 pounds when a family doctor gave her four simple rules to lose weight: . 1. Eat 8 ounces of food every 3 hours . 2. No sugary drinks . 3. Do not skip meals . 4. Do not tell anyone what you're doing . Now 242 pounds lighter, Mills credits that last tip for helping her through the most difficult months of her weight loss journey. Not having someone questioning every bite or trying to persuade her to relax on weekends helped her focus on the goal. ""It's so much better to walk into a room and have someone say, 'Hey, did you do something different?' than to announce, 'I'm on a diet,' and have people pointing fingers at you,"" she said. The advice seems counterintuitive. Weight Watchers and similar groups tout support as a major reason for their programs' success, and studies have found that accountability is important in accomplishing a goal. But telling family, friends and Facebook about your diet plans could have a detrimental effect, some experts say. Mills' doctor, Jon Walz, gives all of his weight loss patients the same rules. He blames the need for secrecy on the culture of obesity. Since childhood, he says, we've searched out people who look and act like us. ""People who are obese live with obese people. They find obese friends. Most (patients) don't recognize how bad a lifestyle they have, how self-defeating a lifestyle is.. They think that culture's normal."" As human beings we have a difficult time with change, Walz continues. So when someone we love alters his or her lifestyle, we have a problem dealing with it -- even if that transformation is positive. ""Deliberately or not, the family, the friends, the other people who are part of that individual's culture will resist the change,"" Walz says. ""(They) will try to change them back to what the culture tolerates."" Mills has discovered the truth in his theory. After she dropped a significant amount of weight, she couldn't hide her diet anymore. That's when friends started drifting away. ""People are mean -- people who you would normally think would be supportive. One friend told me she liked it better when I was the fat friend. That hurt,"" Mills said. There are other reasons to keep your weight loss plans to yourself. Dr. Peter Gollwitzer, a professor of psychology at New York University, studies how goals and plans affect cognition and behavior. In his research paper, ""When Intentions Go Public,"" Gollwitzer describes how spilling the beans -- and the resulting response -- can change someone's actions. Everyone has what Gollwitzer terms an ""identity goal"" of some kind, whether it's to be a good mother or a better scientist. In the case of weight loss, that goal is to be a successful dieter. To reach an identity goal, you need indicators of your accomplishments. For a scientist it's published research papers or a boss' recognition. For a dieter it could be pounds dropped or praise from friends/family when they see how great you look. Gollwitzer's studies found that when you tell people what you intend to do, and that intention is acknowledged, the recognition qualifies as an indicator of accomplishment. ""The danger is that you feel that you have already reached the goal and because of that you don't have to act on it any more,"" Gollwitzer says. In other words, when you tell a friend that you're planning to drop 20 pounds and she notices your good intention, you no longer feel the need to follow through with exercise or healthy eating. There are a number of ways to avoid this phenomenon. ""One is simple -- you can keep your mouth shut,"" Gollwitzer says. ""Another one is to form different kinds of intentions, not only say what you want to do but also when, where and how you want to do it."" Such planning helps create situational action control, he explains. When you find yourself at the gym before work, the situation you mentally mapped out controls your behavior instead of your intention to exercise more. The third way, Gollwitzer says, is to tell only one or two people who hold power over you (metaphorically) so that they help you stick to your intentions. Select those people carefully, fitness and nutrition expert Bonnie MeChelle warns. The author of ""Accountability is Key"" says people with negative energy or a trainer that doesn't fit your style, won't help. But if you do find someone who will hold you responsible, share away. ""Tell them everything,"" MeChelle says. ""Accountability is key because if you keep everything to yourself, no one is going to know what you're doing -- no one is going to know if you fall off the wagon."" Whether you choose to share your diet plans or keep them secret, it's important to remember exactly who you're losing weight for. ""If you're losing weight to please other people, your motivation will not be sustained to keep going when the going gets rough,"" MeChelle says. And until you drop those extra pounds, you're the only one who has to know.","Dr. Jon Walz tells all his weight-loss patients to keep their diet plans secret .

"Corcoran, California (CNN) -- Notorious killer Charles Manson, 77, was denied parole Wednesday after a California parole panel ""could find nothing good as far as suitability"" for his being paroled, a commissioner said. Manson didn't show up for his parole hearing, which was held at a state prison in Corcoran, California, where he is serving a life sentence. Manson's next parole hearing was scheduled for 15 years from now, meaning he could die in prison. California Board of Parole Hearings Commissioner John Peck said that Manson has accumulated 108 serious disciplinary violations in prison since 1971 and that he has shown no indication of remorse for his nine murder convictions. Manson hasn't participated in any self-help programs or vocational training, Peck said. Manson also hasn't shown any parole plans, he said. Peck also cited Manson's statement to a psychologist in a prison interview on November 2, 2011, in which Manson stated: . ""I am special. I am not like the average inmate. I have put five people in the grave. I've been in prison most of my life. I'm a very dangerous man,"" Manson told the psychologist, according to a report read aloud by Peck during the hearing. Those statements marked a change from Manson's past denials of having murdered nine people in 1969, and the statements showed some insight into his crimes, Peck said, reading from the report. But two-member parole panel still found the statements troubling, denying him parole and scheduling his next hearing for 15 years from now, the maximum allowed under law, Peck said. That would put Manson at age 92 for his next hearing, unless he petitions the board for an earlier hearing. Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Patrick Sequeira, who opposed Manson's parole at the hearing, said Manson is likely to die in prison. Sequeira said he didn't know which ""five people"" Manson was referring to in his statement to the psychologist. ""When you think a person will be 92 years old, it's very likely that there will be no further parole hearings for Mr. Manson,"" Sequeira told reporters after the 80-minute hearing concluded. ""He does not deserve to be returned to society,"" the prosecutor added. ""He has a history of refusing to cooperate, not only with psychologists for evaluations, but also for treatment."" DeJon R. Lewis, Manson's state-appointed attorney, who has never met his client, said he didn't know why Manson didn't show up for the hearing. Manson hasn't appeared at any of his parole hearings during the past 15 years. Manson didn't come out of his cell to participate in an interview with Lewis a month ago, Lewis told the parole panel. ""Quite frankly, I don't think he could have helped himself today by speaking on the record,"" Lewis told reporters after the hearing. Manson now has been denied parole 12 times, authorities said. Manson was initially sentenced to death for the grisly 1969 slayings of pregnant actress Sharon Tate and eight others by a group of his followers -- called his ""family"" -- as part of what prosecutors said was an attempt to incite an apocalyptic race war between whites and blacks during the country's massive social unrest. Manson's death sentence was changed to life in prison after California's death penalty was overturned for a period during the 1970s. Manson and his family staged crime scenes to appear as if African-Americans or the Black Panthers committed the murders, Sequeira told the panel. He called the stabbing and shooting deaths ""domestic terror."" After the race war, Manson and his followers would emerge from their desert retreat ""to rule the world,"" Sequeira told the panel. Manson and his followers believed the Beatles' ""White Album"" predicted such an apocalyptic war, Sequeira told the panel. Debra Tate, the sister of Sharon Tate, who attended Wednesday's hearing, told the parole panel that she believed Manson declined to attend the proceeding because he didn't want to hear her or any other victim's impact statement. ""He clearly does not want to be released into the public,"" Tate told the parole board. After Manson was denied parole, with his next hearing scheduled for 2027, Tate was ""elated,"" she told reporters. She has been attending Manson's parole hearings for the past 15 years. ""I was very pleased that we will never hear from Charlie Manson again,"" Tate told reporters. ""I don't have to see him again. For this one, it's over."" Last October, Manson was found to be in possession of an inmate-manufactured weapon and he is now being held for 15 months in isolation in a secured housing unit in the California State Prison Corcoran, said Commissioner Gilbert Robles, the other member of the two-person parole panel. In another incident, Manson was also found to be in a possession of a cell phone, another prison violation, the panel said. Of the 108 serious discipline violations committed by Manson in prison, 35 of them were violent, Sequeira said. Seven of the serious disciplinary violations occurred since Manson's previous parole hearing in 2007, the prosecutor said. Manson has a history of manipulative and controlling behavior and has a record of mental health issues, including schizophrenia and a paranoid delusional disorder, Robles said. Manson also had a history of using drugs such as LSD, amphetamines and barbiturates, but he hasn't participated in any self-help programs for the last 11 years, Robles said. Manson dropped out of school at 3rd grade when he was 9 years old, and he spent years in boy reformatories. But he hasn't used his prison time to obtain a GED, which is an alternative high school diploma, according to Robles and Peck. Manson posted an IQ of 121 in 1972, which is average to high average of intellectual functioning, Sequeira said.","NEW: Manson is being held in isolation after being caught with a weapon in October .

"(CNN) -- An Australian man who ""surfed"" a floating whale carcass surrounded by sharks has admitted that he was an ""idiot"" to attempt the foolhardy feat. Harrison Williams, 26, was on a boating excursion with friends off the coast of Western Australia over the weekend when they came across the dead whale. ""Out on the boat with the boys and one of my mates thought it'd be pretty funny if I surfed the whale, so I just did it,"" Williams told CNN affiliate Seven Network. He launched himself into the water and clambered onto the rotting carcass. But his friends' mirth quickly turned to horror when they noticed all the sharks swimming around the whale, feasting on its flesh. ""Hazza! There's sharks there! Come back!"" screams one of his friends in a video of the bizarre scene. 'Mum thinks I'm an idiot' Several tiger sharks and at least one great white shark were reported to have been feeding on the carcass. Williams said he'd seen the sharks, including the great white, before he jumped in. But that didn't put him off taking the leap. ""He was too busy chomping on the whale so wasn't too bad,"" he told Seven Network. But not everyone was impressed. The Department of Fisheries said his behavior was risky and irresponsible, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. And Williams' parents were none too pleased. ""Mum thinks I'm an idiot, Dad's not too proud either,"" he said. He said he now agrees with their assessment and is ""pretty grateful to still be alive."" Carcass brings threat to beach . Authorities say that because the whale was dead and Williams didn't remove any part of it, he won't be fined for his actions, Seven Network reported. The carcass has since washed up on a beach at Scarborough, a suburb of the city of Perth, apparently drawing sharks with it. Authorities said they had closed that beach and two others nearby, with sharks sighted in the vicinity. Williams, meanwhile, says he won't be trying any similar stunts again.

"(CNN) -- In January, Carol Highsmith, 68, began a journey of threes. She had three milestones of 50 that she planned to reach by following three simple rules: . At 175 pounds, the 5-foot-1 Highsmith was at her heaviest weight. She vowed to lose 50 pounds so she could fit into a 50-year-old dress from high school. Determined to stun all her old classmates, Highsmith saw her invitation to Minnehaha Academy's 50th reunion as the catalyst to spark a lifestyle change. Voted ""Most Mischievous"" by her classmates in 1964, the Takoma Park, Maryland, resident was determined to reclaim some of her youth. ""I wanted to go back [to high school] as I left,"" she says. ""Still having fun in life... looking slim and feeling as good as I did back then."" Looking back, Highsmith would never have predicted she'd have weight problems. ""If I had seen a photo of myself as I look right now ... I would have died of embarrassment!"" But though she was thin, her eating habits were far from healthy. ""In my teens, I would go on all sorts of diets -- one time all I ate was hot dogs -- to make sure I fit into all my pretty dresses."" Once she started her career, those bad choices began to take their toll. She started to travel a lot and it became easy to eat what she calls ""road food"" frequently. ""I remember my first bite of a Krispy Kreme donut. It was heaven! I wanted more and many. One time I did a photo shoot at a Krispy Kreme place and they gave us two dozen donuts. I ate five in one sitting."" Her poor eating habits caused her health to slowly deteriorate -- both mentally and physically. She began to feel so self-conscious about her body that she only wore polyester pants and would never tuck her shirt in for fear of showing just how much weight she had gained. When she received news of her upcoming reunion, Highsmith vowed to follow what she called the ""WWW Plan"" so that she could wear her favorite high school dress again. Her first step was watching what she ate. She tried to eat only 1,300 calories per day of almost entirely unprocessed foods. Step two was walking. She purchased a step tracker and made sure to log 10,000 to 25,000 steps per day, even if that required her to walk the halls and stairs of her hotel late at night. The last step was drinking lots of water. She began to drink five to six bottles a day to ensure she was staying hydrated in the midst of all of her walking. Complicating her mission, Highsmith knew she was going to be on the road during the months leading up to the reunion, working on a photography project for the Library of Congress, capturing photos of 21st century America for the Prints and Photographs Archive. She would also be staying busy with her This is America! Foundation, which she founded to capture and catalog hundreds of thousands of photos of ""slices of American life threatened by technological change, rampant development and widespread cultural homogenization."" She had to customize her weight loss strategy to her nomadic lifestyle. Although gas stations full of candy and other unhealthy snacks beckoned, Highsmith fought cravings by carrying unsalted nuts, canned baked beans, unsweetened Greek yogurt and fresh fruit. For breakfast, Highsmith would generally eat fruit, poached eggs, ham and a little milk and coffee. Protein was key for keeping her full well into the afternoon. Lunchtime was a less structured meal. Highsmith made a point to never eat lunch ""just because it was lunchtime,"" but to wait until she genuinely felt hungry. Then she would eat some yogurt, fruit and nuts, or a fresh salad. For dinner, she usually ordered grilled fish, sweet potatoes and vegetables. Sometimes she would allow herself to splurge on a carefully measured pat of butter for her sweet potatoes. ""Every time I thought about not walking all the steps or not drinking the water or having just one extra handful of nuts, I thought about how much fun it (would) be to go the Minnehaha Academy reunion and look like a million,"" says Highsmith. Between her healthy eating habits and being constantly on her feet, Highsmith watched as the pounds melted away. ""Every day that I follow my weight loss plan I am thrilled,"" Highsmith wrote to CNN in the middle of her journey. ""All of it helps me feel better about myself. When I look in the mirror and see a slimmer me, I am more confident and know I look good in my clothes."" She was careful, though, not to get distracted from her main goal: her health. ""I eat only when I am hungry, but if I get hungry, I need to eat,"" says Highsmith. ""I am not on a starvation diet -- I am on a healthy, let me lose this weight and live longer journey. I never mention the word 'diet.'"" When the day of her 50th high school reunion arrived, Highsmith was ready and eager to show off her new physique. Her classmates were stunned with her transformation. ""I was very impressed,"" says former classmate Linda Bjorklund, who has stayed in touch over the years. ""She was very disciplined about her food intake and her exercise. Carol usually does whatever she sets her mind to doing ... she always gives everything 115%."" Highsmith's message to her classmates? ""Find a way to turn back the clock and wake up feeling good every day."" At 130 pounds, Highsmith's journey is not over. She plans to lose 20 more pounds by her birthday in May 2015, vowing to continue eschewing sweets, walking at least 10,000 steps per day, and eating and drinking properly. But she is in no rush to see the numbers on the scale go down. ""I am not trying to lose it fast because I did not gain it fast,"" says Highsmith. ""We are what we eat and I have decided for the rest of my life that if something goes into my mouth, it must be good for me.""","Carol Highsmith was determined to lose 50 pounds for her 50th high school reunion .

"(CNN) -- The Israeli Ministry of Construction and Housing has issued tenders for the building of 1,877 settlement units in the West Bank and Jerusalem. A spokesman for the minister of housing said new projects have been announced and will be published Sunday. ""The notices are for builders to bid on contracts to construct projects,"" spokesman Arik Ben Shimon said. In a statement, Israeli settlement watch group, Peace Now, said the move is a blow to the efforts by U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, to work out a framework agreement for the resumption of negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis. ""A government that issues tenders for almost 1,900 housing units is fooling its own public, the Palestinians leadership, the international community and especially the U.S. Secretary of State, who has just recently left the region,"" Peace Now said in a statement. Since the beginning of Kerry's efforts, Israel has issued new tenders for 5,349 settlement units. Of the total, 2,258 are to be built in the West Bank and 3,091 in East Jerusalem, Peace Now said. ""The current Israeli government under ( Prime Minister Benjamin ) Netanyahu has issued tenders for 11,047 settlement units in East Jerusalem and the West Bank , and were promoted through different stages,"" said Lior Amihai, acting director for Peace Now. Marc Regev, a spokesman for the Prime Minister, said they have yet to receive any reaction from the United States. ""The only thing we are saying is that the tender speaks for itself,"" he said. Palestinian officials said the announcement was a ""slap in the face for all those who are trying to make peace."" ""This is a deliberate attempt by the Israeli government to torpedo and destroy Kerry's efforts,"" said Palestinian chief negotiator, Sa'eb Erekat. ""As much as Mr. Kerry intensifies his efforts to achieve peace, Netanyahu intensifies his efforts to torpedo Kerry's efforts. This is a total destructive policy towards peace.""

"Boston (CNN) -- For more than a year, Ellen O'Donnell slept on the streets, where she was the target of theft, violence and cruelty. Her situation left her neglecting chronic health problems that threatened her survival. ""It was so difficult to access [medical] services. I was totally alienated and I just couldn't relate,"" O'Donnell said. ""I would get things stolen from me. And ... two young women tried to set me on fire. Life was just this movie and I wasn't going to bother participating anymore."" Then O'Donnell stumbled upon someone she could relate to: Dr. Roseanna Means. Since 1999, Means and her team have set up clinics inside Boston shelters to offer direct, free medical care to thousands of homeless women and children. ""The women come into the shelters to get warm, to eat, to feel safe. And we're already there,"" said Means, 58. There's no registration or charge for the care. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . ""The women learn to trust us as ambassadors of the health care system. And over time, we can teach them how to use [it] as it was intended,"" she said. Means gave up a more lucrative medical career to work with Boston's homeless population. As a medical resident pursuing cardiology in 1982, she spent three months providing care in a Cambodian refugee camp and found a different calling. ""They had lost everything. And I was able to make a difference just by traveling 10,000 miles out of my comfort zone ... and lending a hand, some medicines, and talking to them and treating their wounds,"" Means said. ""That made a huge impression on me."" She became a primary care physician and found she could make a difference with Boston's homeless population in a similar way. ""What I had to give them, more than anything, was just showing up, to listen and offer my services,"" she said. Means started her nonprofit -- Women of Means -- after working for seven years with the city's established homeless health care programs. She found that, despite all of the quality medical resources for the homeless population, few women were actually using the services. Female victims of domestic violence are often reluctant to use identification that could reveal their whereabouts, and vulnerable women often avoid clinic waiting rooms where they might encounter hostile members of the homeless community, Means said. ""For women who are poor, homeless or battered, to deal with a system of health care becomes overwhelming,"" she said. ""There are lots of emotional issues, psychiatric issues ... I just didn't like the idea that they were falling through the cracks."" Q&A: Why homeless women have it worse than men . Women of Means works in 10 women's shelters and offers help to more than 2,000 homeless women counted in the city's latest census. The group consists of a part-time staff of nine nurses and 17 volunteer doctors representing all areas of care. Teams work out of old broom closets and stairwells, addressing health issues ranging from colds to life-threatening cancers and gunshot wounds. The first challenge the group often faces in caring for the women is trust. ""[They] don't trust anyone. It's a side product of being homeless, of having to look over your shoulder, watch your back. So that makes it very difficult for them to approach life normally,"" she said. For this reason, the group handles first encounters as vital steppingstones in building a relationship. Because they are not billing for services, staff are able to give whatever amount of time is needed to earn the clients' trust, ultimately helping them open up and engage in their own health. ""This is not just about a checkup or doling out antibiotics for an infection, but it's about giving these women the acceptance -- and love -- they deserve,"" Means said. ""It's a process. It takes a long time. But we don't put any time limits on it 'cause we know that in some cases, it's literally life-saving."" The group functions entirely off grants and private and corporate donations. The physician and nurse teams work in the same shelter locations for at least one year, though most extend well beyond their initial commitment. The doctors together donate $500,000 in services annually, and everyone covers their own insurance and benefits. Women of Means has had a waiting list of volunteer physicians for years because the group's current doctors ""don't ever leave,"" said Means. ""We have people who have been here for nine years ... because doctors just want to be doctors. There's no managed-care rules. There's no regulations. There's no co-pays. We love taking care of these women. And frankly it's because that's all we do. It's just health care,"" Means said. O'Donnell has benefited from the group's approach. When she met Means three years ago, she had a cataract that had gotten so bad, she said, that doctors weren't sure she had any sight in the eye. With Means' help, O'Donnell had surgery to correct it. ""Dr. Roseanna talked to my social worker and they literally held my hand and took me to the hospital,"" O'Donnell said. ""I just took the leap because Dr. Roseanna was there."" Today, O'Donnell's newfound sight has lifted her depression and helped her take fewer medications. Recently, she secured a bed at a residential shelter and said she aspires to start a paralegal service from her next apartment. O'Donnell credits her improved vitality to Means. ""Because I knew she really cared, I started wanting to take care of myself,"" she said. For Means, that's what her program is all about. ""I love these women no matter what. That eventually starts to get taken inside -- that if I matter to somebody else, maybe I matter to myself,"" she said. ""We give women who are poor, homeless or battered the means to move ahead in their lives. ... This is what feeds my soul and I will do this until I'm no longer needed."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Keith Trotter stared at the picture that popped up on his Facebook feed. He felt like the floor was opening up and swallowing him whole. This photo of himself had been taken a few days earlier at a 2009 New Year's Eve party and posted by his friend Jeremy. Trotter was 386 pounds at the time, wearing size 60 pants, and holding a plate of food. He had known for a while that he was overweight and out of shape. But this guy? He didn't recognize himself. ""I don't have a neck, I don't have a lap ... I look like a swollen pig,"" said Trotter, now 42 years old. He thought: ""Why hasn't someone just slapped me with something heavy and said 'You're going to die -- you look awful'? "" At first, the father of five in Wisconsin felt overwhelmed with anger and shame. He wanted his friend to take down the picture. But when he cooled off, he knew it was his own responsibility to make a change. Trotter, the manager of payment operations for a regional health plan, had made a career of managing processes, policies and procedures. His job involved thinking about how employees could do things better and more cost effectively, based on data and measurable results. Trotter's iReport: 100 Small Steps to 160 Pound Weight Loss . He decided to apply those management concepts to his weight loss. He kept a journal tracking what worked for him, and by the end of three years, he had lost 158 pounds. Midway through, he began to chronicle his journey on the blog ""100 small steps,"" and is currently trying to turn it into a book. Here's how Trotter lost the weight: . He did tons of research. As Trotter first started his weight-loss quest, he joined a program that provided protein shakes and pre-made meals, but quickly realized ""I didn't have the money or the desire to eat out of a box my entire life."" He read psychological journals, fitness blogs and books about weight loss to learn the underlying causes of obesity and proven strategies that worked for other people. One book was ""Fit to Lead,"" which looks at the connection between fitness and productivity. He got therapy. Learning how depression and obesity may affect each other made Trotter serious about losing weight and getting help. Counseling helped him confront past disappointments, make peace with the fact that he hadn't fulfilled his dream of becoming an opera singer, and find healthier things to do when he felt stressed or upset. ""I really didn't like who I had become. I had to learn how to fall in love with that person again,"" he said. ""I wrote down all the things I didn't like about myself and I wrote all the things I liked ... I had to learn how to like that person, and want to do things to stop abusing that person."" He kept reminders all around. That picture from New Year's Eve that made him sick? He put it up all over his house, laid a copy on the passenger seat of his car and made it the home screen on his phone. He showed the photo to anyone who would listen as a way of keeping himself accountable as he lost weight. ""I looked for opportunities to talk about it, to share my story with other people. That's my reminder all the time. That's me -- that's who I was -- and I don't ever want to go back there."" He ditched his credit card. Trotter, who spends a lot of time on the road, realized that he'd be more mindful about his food purchases if he stopped using plastic. He put himself on daily cash rations -- $10 for breakfast and lunch -- and found he was a lot more likely to buy food that was truly ""fuel"" instead of junk. He turned off the TV. After a hunting trip with some buddies, it dawned on him that snow pants, boots and warm socks made it a lot more enjoyable to stay outside, even in the cold Wisconsin winter. When he got home, he took the family shopping for sweaters, warm gloves and other gear so they could spend more time outside and less time watching movie marathons and eating popcorn. ""I knew we were finally doing it right when someone asked me about a popular TV show and I had no idea what they were talking about,"" he wrote. He kept workouts simple. Trotter initially was too embarrassed about his body to go to the gym, and when he did, he found his stomach was so large that it physically hurt to use the machines. But there were lots of exercises he could do at home: Stair push-ups, jumping jacks, deep knee bends, situps and other sweat-breaking routines. Now that he's thinner, he uses the gym at his office about three times a week but still does calisthenics every day at home. He embraced routines. He only ate while sitting at the table, had a salad before each meal, and chewed each bite at least 20 times. Trotter learned another trick to curb his cravings: Brushing his teeth right afterward, when he was most likely to long for a honey bun -- his Achilles' heel. ""Trust me when I tell you, honey buns and Colgate don't mix,"" he said. He didn't deprive himself. After several months of avoiding all the foods that were bad for him, Trotter said he realized he was obsessed about honey buns, cheese puffs and all the willpower-busting snacks he couldn't have. Once he allowed himself cheat days, the cravings went away. He is careful about what he eats most of the time, and in fact, he earned the nickname ""Temple"" because he was always talking about treating his body like a temple. Still, he allows himself one special meal a week. He also practices restraint by putting cheese puffs in a tea cup for portion control, or eating half a candy bar and wrapping up the rest for another time. Trotter's openness about his journey has inspired a lot of people in his life, including his boss, Tami Renz, who hired him when he was halfway through his weight loss. She herself has battled the bulge and lost 50 pounds. ""We've talked about recipes that eliminate fat, or spices that you can add that aren't salt,"" Renz said. ""I have a tendency to beat myself up if I stepped backwards, and he says, 'It's a new day.' "" Trotter's friend Jeremy Swanson, who posted that New Year's Eve picture on Facebook, says he never thought of Trotter as obese. But he's not surprised that Trotter succeeded in his transformation. ""He's definitely faced many challenges in his life since I've known him. I've watched him own his own business and the challenge that presents ... having that many mouths to feed on a daily basis, having to pay all those bills, and he makes it happen,"" Swanson said. ""I knew there would be results. There's no doubt that he would conquer it."" Since his initial 158-pound weight loss, Trotter says he put on about 10 pounds of muscle. Now at 6 feet tall and 238 pounds, with a 40-inch waist, he knows he still has some work to do but is much happier about how he looks and feels. He knew he had turned a corner when he wrote in his journal a year ago: ""5:15 p.m.: Really craving a honey bun ... 5:45 p.m.: Honey buns are overrated!"" He hasn't had a honey bun since.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Two U.S. airmen and a Japanese surfer remained missing Monday after a powerful typhoon swept past the southern part of the country. The two airmen were among four who were washed out to sea as a group of them took photos of big waves on a beach on the island of Okinawa on Sunday afternoon, according to the Japanese Coast Guard. One airman managed to make it back to the beach, but another was found in the water and confirmed dead later Sunday, the coast guard said. The search for the two missing men was hampered by rough seas, said Kadena Air Base, the U.S. military installation where they were serving. All three names are being withheld until the Air Force can notify next of kin. Surfer goes missing near Tokyo . The seas were churned up by Typhoon Phanfone, which made landfall in central Japan early Monday. It packed sustained winds as strong as 130 kph (81 mph) when it hit land near the city of Hamamatsu, after having moved up the country's southeastern coastline. A 21-year-old university student went missing at lunchtime Sunday while surfing off the coast of Fujisawa, a beach suburb of Tokyo, the coast guard said. Unleashing fierce winds and torrential rain, the typhoon brought widespread disruption to Tokyo and other areas near its path. Thirty-nine people have been injured, authorities said. Hundreds of flights canceled . More than 1.2 million people throughout a wide area of central and eastern Japan have been advised to evacuate to shelters, Japanese fire and rescue officials said Monday. More than 7,000 others have been ordered to relocate. Air transport was paralyzed, with more than 400 domestic flights canceled, affecting more than 50,000 people. Bullet trains between Tokyo and Osaka, Japan's second biggest city, were also disrupted. Elementary and junior high schools in large areas of central Japan were closed to avoid the heavy rain and strong winds. The storm had moved out into the Pacific Ocean by Monday afternoon, and meteorologists said conditions should improve by nightfall. Risk of mudslides . But the typhoon left behind the danger of mudslides and flooding in mountainous areas. Officials have expressed particular concern about the situation at Mount Ontake, a volcano that suddenly erupted last weekend, killing dozens of hikers. The typhoon has caused search efforts to be suspended for about a dozen people who remain missing on the volcano, the Japanese news agency Kyodo reported. The high accumulation of volcanic ash on the mountain, combined with the forecast of heavy rain, increases the danger of mudslides. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki reported from Tokyo and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Josh Levs and Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.","NEW: More than 1.2 million people were advised to evacuate to shelters, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Politicians are running for office again. Despite our best efforts, there is nothing we can do stop them. Tuesday there will be an election. Here are 10 things to look for as the election returns come in: . 1. Did voters choose the least recent of two evils? To adapt a quote often borrowed by my friend, Mark Shields, Mae West said that when faced with a choice between two evils, she usually picked the one she had not tried lately. If Republicans win, even by large margins Tuesday night, was it only because they were a less recent evil? Will the GOP get the message that they are not being embraced for who they are but only given a shot because who they are not? If Republicans don't get that message, they can write off 2016. 2. The ""war on women"" distraction: Michael Goodwin writes that President Barack Obama's ""commitment to a more powerful government at home and abdication of American leadership around the world is being exposed as a historic calamity."" Whether you agree with Goodwin or not, it is hard to dispute that America's challenges are overwhelming American leadership. Under Democrats' watch, polls show that most Americans believe our economy has fossilized like an Egyptian mummy. The Middle East has caught on fire, ISIS has grown from JV team to Super Bowl contender, Russia's Vladimir Putin strides the Earth unchecked, Obamacare turns out to be Medicaid and Ebola is threatening to become a pandemic. Yet, the Democratic theme this cycle is that a Republican Party dominated by old, white men does not understand the concerns of modern women. Seriously? Is this obvious distraction the best the Democratic Party can do? Who would have thought that, when the world is burning down, it would be Democrats advising women not to worry their pretty little heads about anything other than gender issues? Tuesday night, we will learn whether the Democratic campaign was too small for the times, insulting and demeaning. 3. Will Tuesday night empower Elizabeth Warren? On Election Night, count the number of Democrats in swing or purple states who lose their Senate seats. An untold story in Washington is that Democrats, like Republicans, are becoming a much less moderate party. It is unlikely the Democratic base will react to Senate losses by calling for moderation instead of purity: Fewer moderates means that extreme elements in the Democratic base will be able to raise an even larger voice. Losses in purple states such as Iowa, Colorado, New Hampshire and North Carolina will empower Warren's shrill populism. Wednesday morning, Hillary Clinton may have to apologize for apologizing for saying that ""businesses don't create jobs."" 4. Does success divide Republicans? Republicans have been split between establishment types, libertarians, neo-isolationists, tea party supporters, social issue conservatives and a small group that fears trigonometry. One man has brought them all together, however: Barack Obama. Who would have thought that, if only in this perverse way, Obama would succeed George Bush as a uniter and not a divider? No GOP faction will be credited for Tuesday night's victories or blamed for defeats because Republicans actually are, if only temporarily, united. Instead, the GOP's challenge will be to hold these factions together if Republicans gain a majority in the Senate. Tuesday night, if Republicans such as Ted Cruz are talking about repealing Obamacare or social issues, they are inviting division. If, instead, they explain that this election has given them an opportunity to lead an economic renewal, it will be a sign that Republicans are trying to hold the party together and have actually smartened up a bit. 5. Does defeat kick off WWIII within the Democratic Party? Bill Clinton is all that is left of a Democratic Party that once had a sense of humor, declared ""the era of big government is over"" and understood we have to create prosperity before we share it. The party's base, however, enjoys none of these fine qualities. Its heart beats with Warren's populism and Obama's post-Clinton liberalism. Tuesday night, look to see who blames whom for Democratic losses, and keep an especially sharp eye on pro-growth, pro-business Democrats and big Democratic contributors. Will they engage in any serious self-reflection? If Democrats only blame the consumer (voters) or the marketers (the consultants) instead of the team who made the product (Obama, Sen. Harry Reid, Warren, et al.), they are whistling past the graveyard. New Democrats need to start a war and pull their party back to the center for 2016. 6. Does Obama's presidency effectively end Tuesday night?  Recently, when we've seen someone wearing a hazmat suit on the news, it may have been a medical professional protecting us from Ebola. Or, it could have been a Democratic candidate trying to protect themselves from a presidential visit. President Obama has deluded himself that he is not a plague upon Democratic candidates but Tuesday evening, two East Coast states may set him straight. If Republicans win early on the East Coast, in tight races such as New Hampshire and North Carolina, denial will no longer be an option and the President may be put in quarantine. With a bad night in these states, Jimmy Carter may have a better chance of getting invited to speak at the 2016 Democratic convention than Barack Obama. Why does that matter? Because politicians with huge egos rarely fade gracefully from public view, especially while still in office. Obama is the man who said, ""I'm LeBron baby,"" told us his policies were ""on the ballot"" and made sure this midterm election was all about him. A President without the support of his country, caged in his own White House, bouncing off the walls like a wounded animal, can do great damage to his party and his country. Tuesday night will shape Obama's final two years. 7. Has the Republican Party seen its future? The most important race for Republicans Tuesday night will be the Senate race in Colorado, where the next generation of Republican has been born. Cory Gardner, a sunny, optimistic, self-declared ""new kind of Republican,"" may show his GOP companions how they can seize the future if they are more than the grumpy old party of ""no"" and explain how their principles can renew our economy and our country. In Gardner, Republicans may see the difference between a merely acceptable and a desirable alternative to today's Democrats. Colorado matters. Watch this state to see what the Republican Party can be. 8. Is the Democratic turnout machine still the difference?  In states such as North Carolina and Georgia, Democrats have a home field advantage: big, urban areas with large concentrations of targetable voters. We should get a good read on the power of the Democratic turnout machines in the North Carolina and Georgia Senate races. If Sen. Kay Hagan hangs on in North Carolina, credit the Democratic ground game. Alert for Republicans: There is no reason your adversaries can't squeeze two or three extra points out of their superior ground game not only this cycle, but in 2016. My bet? Hagan is trapped with about 45% of the vote and 3 points from a superior ground game won't be quite enough. But this is one of the closest races to watch Tuesday evening. 9. Is demography destiny? The Democratic Party is building its future on demography, not ideas. Short-term, their strategy is to turn around elections they might otherwise lose by driving minority and youth turnout to above average levels. Long-term, they hope to build an ""emerging majority"" as their targeted groups become larger parts of the electorate. All this, of course, requires that Democrats remain the overwhelming preference of minority and younger voters. Any cracks in these elemental building blocks of the Obama coalition would not augur well for Democratic strategy, long term. Tuesday night, however, will we see new fissures here? When first elected, Obama's messianic candidacy brought masses of rapturous millennials to the Democratic Party. Now they find themselves in a stagnant economy, bearing massive student debt, living in their parents' basements, facing decades of work to pay for debt racked up by their profligate elders and for their parents' retirement. The higher you lift someone's hope and dreams, the further they may fall. Now, millennial voters are up for grabs. Tuesday will give us a glimpse into the future of the Democratic Party's ""emerging majority."" 10. Is Tuesday night's big loser Washington? For years, both Republicans and Democrats have found electoral success promising solutions from Washington: ""The Five Point Plan for This or That"" Act, the ""Jobs Bill that Helps Politicians Keep Their Jobs"" and the ever-popular ""Equal Pay for the Job You Don't Have Act."" Tuesday night will measure the breadth of the chasm between what Washington promises and what voters actually see it deliver. If Republican Sen. Pat Roberts loses in Kansas, we will know that heartland America's patience with Washington has been exhausted. Washington's currency is its ability to promise. That currency has been immensely devalued. What happens when Americans are no longer willing to accept it in exchange for their votes? We may have reached a tipping point where voters look at promising Washington politicians and say, ""The emperor has no clothes."" And that's the good news for perhaps, at that point, real change will become possible. And for political junkies wondering what to do after this election, the 2016 presidential campaign will be starting right after this commercial break. We can't stop them either.

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- Long lines of cars jammed the roads leading south out of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine Saturday, as residents attempted to flee the city center after a night of heavy shelling on the city's northern outskirts. Hundreds of vehicles were caught in heavy traffic, and trains are no longer running in and out of the city, which is a stronghold for the pro-Russia rebels. There was heavy shelling and antiaircraft fire on the outskirts of the city to the north throughout the night. There has been sustained fighting in the area for weeks, but it appeared more intense overnight than in recent days. Russian news agency Interfax reported a dramatic increase in the number of Ukrainian refugees seeking refuge over the border in Russia. ""The Ukrainian government officials were seeking to encircle the city, really squeeze the remaining pro-Russian separatist forces that had fallen back there since being driven out of other strongholds across Eastern Ukraine,"" said CNN's Phil Black, reporting from a congested road in Donetsk while scores of people attempted to leave. ""It appears the Ukrainian government forces moving closer to the city, perhaps with the intention of retaking it,"" said Black. ""At the southern outskirts of the city again, we saw a very big presence of Ukrainian armored vehicles; tanks, artillery, armored personnel carriers."" An additional 4,600 people have moved into temporary camps over the past 24 hours, Interfax cited Russian Emergency Situations Ministry spokesman Alexander Drobyshevsky as saying. This has pushed the total number of refugees staying in such camps above 31,000, he said. Russia has opened 20 new temporary settlements for Ukrainian refugees in the past day, Drobyshevsky told Interfax, bringing the total number provided to 433. More than 11,000 children are among those staying there, he said. CNN cannot independently confirm the report. According to the latest figures from the United Nations' refugee agency, UNHCR, a total of 141,972 Ukrainians have fled to Russia this year because of unrest in eastern Ukraine, based on information from the Russian Federal Migration Service as of July 22. More than 41,000 of those Ukrainians are reported to have applied for asylum. An additional 101,617 Ukrainians were reported as internally displaced within Ukraine as of July 22, the UNHCR said. However, the refugee agency noted that because of the lack of a centralized registration system, the real number of those who have fled their homes is unknown and is likely to be higher. ""Various organizations report that some displaced persons from the East are reluctant to apply to the authorities because they fear retribution, want to maintain a low profile, and moreover, see little benefit in identifying themselves as there is no special reception procedures established for them,"" the UNHCR said. CNN freelancer released by pro-Russian rebels . A Ukrainian journalist detained Tuesday by pro-Russian rebels while working as a freelance producer for CNN has been freed. Anton Skiba called CNN on Saturday to confirm his release. CNN also received visual confirmation that Skiba is free from sources on the ground in Donetsk. On Tuesday evening, armed fighters led by a senior official from the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic were waiting outside the Donbass Palace Hotel, in the rebel-controlled city of Donetsk, as a CNN television crew returned from a day's work at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Skiba had worked for one day with the CNN crew when he was detained. An official with the Donetsk People's Republic initially accused Skiba of ""terrorism"" and of posting offers, on his Facebook page, of cash rewards for the killing of rebel fighters. The official later dropped the accusation about the Facebook posts and said Skiba was being questioned for having multiple forms of identification with different surnames. Investigation into crash hampered . More than a week after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 came down in eastern Ukraine, Malaysian investigators have not yet been able to access the entire crash site, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Saturday. He urged both the pro-Russia rebels and Ukraine's armed forces to cooperate so investigators can access the site fully. All 298 people aboard the plane died when it crashed on July 17. Of that number, 43 were Malaysian, including 15 crew and two infants, according to Malaysia Airlines. Nine days later, some human remains still lie scattered amid the debris. The rebels controlling the area -- the same rebels that Ukraine and the United States accuse of downing the plane -- hinted on Friday to an international monitoring group that they've nearly had enough of the crash investigation, even with the limited number of investigators they've let in so far. ""We were given the indication ... that their patience is almost wearing out,"" said Michael Bociurkiw, a spokesman for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has had a small team touring the site for days. ""They're saying maybe another week and then they don't know what would happen."" More coffins flown out of Ukraine . Another 38 coffins arrived on two planes from the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv and were given a somber welcome in the Dutch city of Eindhoven on Saturday. This is expected to be the last transfer of coffins from Ukraine to Netherlands for the time being. The search for further remains at the crash site will continue when possible. Meantime, authorities for the first time released the identity of a victim of Dutch nationality. A team of more than 200 specialists are busy with the identification process, but officials have stressed the process could take months. A group of Dutch forensic experts was unable to reach the crash site Saturday because of safety concerns prompted by renewed fighting in the Donetsk area, a spokesman for the Dutch Ministry of Defense said. He said it was also too dangerous for OSCE observers to return to the site. The site is still not secured by the Ukrianian government or any international force. Of the 298 people on board the downed airliner, 193 were Dutch citizens. Pentagon: Russia getting ready to send more powerful weapons into Ukraine .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States will ease some restrictions on defense sales to Vietnam, the State Department announced Thursday, following a meeting between Secretary of State John Kerry and his Vietnamese counterpart. While this change is limited to maritime security-related sales, it is a significant step forward for the U.S.-Vietnamese relationship. The United States previously maintained a full arms embargo on the country, which started during the Vietnam War nearly 40 years ago. During his meeting with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh, Kerry emphasized that any change to defense cooperation will be tied to Vietnam's human rights record, according to State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki. ""Our security relationship remains under constant review,"" Psaki said in a news briefing. ""Clearly, there's more work that needs to be done in areas like human rights, and that's one thing that the secretary conveyed during the meeting. And this is, of course, a partial lifting."" The Vietnamese have been pressing the United States to lift its arms embargo, particularly following aggressive acts by China in the disputed the South China Sea. Boats and brinkmanship up close in the South China Sea . Earlier this year, China towed a deep-sea oil rig into the contested waters, igniting tensions in the region. Asked whether Thursday's announcement, which comes just one day after Kerry met with his Chinese counterpart, was related to the dispute, Psaki was vague. ""Well, in part,"" she said, ""in order to fully integrate Vietnam into maritime security initiatives that, you know, we have partnerships on throughout the region.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actor Tom Cruise has settled a $50 million defamation suit he filed last year against a tabloid publisher after it ran stories accusing him of having ""abandoned"" his daughter Suri during his divorce from her mother, actress Katie Holmes. The lawsuit against Bauer Publishing, In Touch and Life & Style magazines ""has been settled,"" said Lindsay Ferraro, public relations director for both magazines, in an e-mail. ""The terms of the settlement were not disclosed and remain confidential."" Neither Bauer Publishing nor the magazines ""intended to communicate that Tom Cruise had cut off all ties and abandoned his daughter, Suri, and regret if anyone drew that inference from anything they published,"" she added. A court document noted that the suit was dismissed Friday ""with prejudice,"" meaning that it cannot be refiled. The one-paragraph settlement says the dismissal was agreed to by Cruise and the tabloid publisher and that each side was responsible for their own legal fees. In a sworn affidavit filed last month in federal court, Cruise rejected as ""patently false"" the assertion that he had abandoned his daughter, now 7. ""I have in no way cut Suri out of my life -- whether physically, emotionally, financially or otherwise,"" he said. The publisher said then in a statement that both magazines ""stand behind the reporting and articles at issue in Mr. Cruise's action."" The July 18, 2012, Life & Style cover carried the headline ""SURI IN TEARS, ABANDONED BY HER DAD"" along with a photo of the child. There was no accompanying text to explain the headline.

And as mentioned in Apple's announcement Tuesday, T-Mobile will be the first carrier to support seamless switching between WiFi and cellular networks, so you don't have to hang up and redial when you leave the wireless area. For now, the switching capabilities will only be available for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Why is T-Mobile pushing WiFi connections so heavily? ""My answer is, why the f*** not?"" said T-Mobile President and CEO John Legere, who announced the news at a press event in a San Francisco bar Wednesday. Legere took the stage in pink shoes and a leather jacket, dropping his signature bad words, jokes and digs at competitors. The carefully crafted edginess is all part of the fourth-place carrier's ""Uncarrier"" marketing blitz, which positions it as the underdog taking on Verizon, AT&T and Sprint. Personal cell extenders aren't new, but T-Mobile says theirs are not the same products you can buy in stores. T-Mobile claims that one of these custom devices, which usually retail for around $200, can cover a phone up to 3,000 feet in any direction -- hundreds of feel farther than existing cell spots. ""We've injected a secret sauce that prioritizes voice calls,"" said Neville Ray, T-Mobile's chief technology officer. That means that if someone is streaming video on a WiFi network while another person wants to make a call, the video may be slowed so that the phone call gets more bandwidth. The large black box has three external antennas, plugs into an Ethernet cable and can be used instead of existing routers. There is a $25 deposit for the box. T-Mobile is also bringing (limited) WiFi access to the skies. On planes that have GoGo InFlight Wireless service, T-Mobile customers will be able to send and receive texts and listen to voicemails for free. The technology already exists to let passengers make phone calls, but a tangle of airline and FAA rules -- not to mention potential backlash from other fliers -- is limiting this feature to quiet activities. Legere is ambitious and vocal about his desire to overtake the top three cell companies, which he calls the ""Three Stooges."" ""T-Mobile just had its biggest month in company history,"" said Legere. ""We will overtake Sprint this year ... next on our list is AT&T."" Verizon offers iPhone 6 for free .","T-Mobile to offer free cell spots that plug into wireless networks to extend coverage .

"Washington (CNN) -- The GOP's efforts to portray independent Kansas Senate hopeful Greg Orman as a Democrat in disguise haven't yet knocked him out of contention, a new poll shows. Orman and Republican Sen. Pat Roberts are tied at 46% each, according to the Monmouth University survey of 429 likely voters. The survey, which was conducted October 16-19, has a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4.7 percentage points. The results suggest Orman -- who had surged into the lead a month ago after the Democratic candidate dropped out -- has remained competitive despite an onslaught of attacks from Republicans whose hopes of winning Senate control could depend on their ability to keep the seat in deep-red Kansas. Roberts still has work to do winning over conservatives, the poll shows. Just 76% of Republicans said they plan to vote for Roberts, and 8% were undecided. It also shows that a big chunk of the electorate -- 30%-- says it makes ""no difference"" whether Republicans or Democrats control the Senate. The survey is the latest of several in recent weeks to show a right race. A CNN/ORC poll earlier this month found Roberts leading, 49% to Orman's 48%. The Monmouth poll also found Republican Gov. Sam Brownback in deep trouble. He trailed Democratic challenger Paul Davis, who earned 50% of likely voters' support to Brownback's 45%. ""The Kansas polls have been volatile ever since the Democratic nominee withdrew from the Senate race. There may be enough ticket splitting to give the Republicans a win in one contest but not the other,"" said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute in West Long Branch, New Jersey.","A Monmouth poll shows Sen.

"(Wired) -- Military work is physically demanding—and we're not just talking about soldiers on the battlefield. Travel down the chain, and you'll find plenty of positions where strength and stamina are highly valued skills. Take the Navy for example. The Navy needs ships and those ships need to be built and maintained—a rough, physically draining job. Sandblasting, riveting, and grinding excess metal off the ships can take a toll on the human body. You're often carrying tools that can weigh upwards of 30 pounds. ""There's a lot of wear and tear on you,"" says Adam Miller, director of new initiatives for Lockheed Martin. ""Skilled workers can maybe do that for three to four minutes then they need to put the tool down and they need to rest."" Photos of unexpected shooting targets used by the world's armies . For the past couple of years, Miller has been leading a team of engineers and designers to create one of the first industrial-use exoskeletons. Called the FORTIS, the exoskeleton is able to support tools of up to 36 pounds and transfer that load from a worker's hands and arms to the ground. The goal is to lighten workers' loads, ultimately making them more productive and skilled at their jobs. The U.S. Navy recently bought two of the exoskeletons and plans to test them over the next six months to see how they might be used in an industrial situation. Compared to something like the TALOS (Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit), a computerized exoskeleton that essentially wants to turn mere mortals into Iron Man, the FORTIS is fairly simple. ""I would call it elegant,"" says Miller. The anodized aluminum and carbon fiber skeleton weighs 30 pounds, and follows along the outside of a human's body. It has joints in the parts of the body that would regularly have joints (ankle, knee, hip) and flexes from side to side at the waist. Miller says the skeleton was designed for complex environments—whoever is wearing it can climb stairs or a ladder, squat and generally move business as usual in the exoskeleton. Tools mount to the front of the FORTIS and that weight is directed through the joints in the hip and down to the floor, relieving stress on the entire body, including the feet and ankles. People around the world pose with everything they eat in a day . Watch and Learn . The design team began by watching how humans walk. ""You have to look at biomechanics of the person because it's not just a stand; it's really something they can move around in,"" says Miller. The FORTIS was designed so it could slip over a worker's boot—this is important since feet often communicate the first signs of weariness. It's like running in a pair of crappy shoes; it impacts your entire body. Many exoskeletons transfer that weight to the sole of the foot, but this is a problem, says Miller. ""When the weight of the tools and exoskeleton itself is transferred to the ground, it comes to rest on the sole,"" he says. ""However, a sole can also contribute to user discomfort, increased metabolic cost to the user and introduces instability."" Instead, the FORTIS uses a stirrup that attaches to the ankle, allowing the foot to rest on the ground as usual. Why are we so fat? The multimillion-dollar scientific quest to find out . Early tests show that the exoskeleton has increased productivity anywhere from two to 27 times, depending on the task. The team measured the amount of time a worker could hold a 16-pound grinder overhead without having to rest his arms. ""The longest operators could work continuously without a break was three minutes sustained without augmentation,"" says Miller. ""Using the FORTIS, operators could work 30 minutes or longer without requiring rest breaks."" Lockheed Martin has been developing exoskeleton technology for the past five years. Its other exoskeleton, the HULC, is hydraulic-powered and can support up to 200 pounds. The HULC was designed to be used on the field, during battle. The FORTIS' capabilities are scaled down, but with its focus on mobility, you can imagine that it could be useful for other industries like construction or mining—""anywhere there's a complex and irregular environment,"" says Miller. ""We're expecting other industries to see it and say, 'We want something similar.'"" More from Wired: . The mystery of go, the ancient game that computers still can't win .

"(CNN) -- As a baseball executive whose mother survived relentless domestic violence, and an advocate who worked for years to pass the Violence Against Women Act, we want to celebrate the 20th anniversary of that life-saving bill, signed into law on September 13, 1994. This groundbreaking law was the first to put the full force of the federal government into efforts to stop violence against women and help victims. It reshaped our criminal justice system, ushered in training for law enforcement and judges, and enhanced a life-saving national network of services and supports that has saved countless lives. Over time, the law became a catalyst for broader, badly needed change. In fact, according to the Justice Department, intimate partner violence has dropped 64% since the Violence Against Women Act was passed 20 years ago. Now that's something we can all be proud of. But frankly, the media paid little attention to the bill that was introduced by then-Senator Joe Biden, and signed into law by President Clinton in 1994. They were too busy clamoring over the story about a high-profile NFL football hero named O.J. Simpson. Simpson had a history of domestic violence and was on trial for the murder of his wife and friend. He was acquitted in that famous trial. But the Simpson story had a silver lining: It led to tens of thousands of women around the country feeling empowered to reveal their own stories of abuse. And it gave activists an opportunity to rally their communities and demand more services and protections for victims and survivors. It took the topic of domestic violence from the back page to the front page and to the top of the newscast -- everywhere. It's ironic, then, that 20 years later, the nation would be so laser-focused on the story of another football hero. In this case, it's the story of Baltimore Raven player Ray Rice that is dominating our conversations, and despite the damage done, there is a positive repercussion worth noting: Again, thousands of people are sharing personal statements and encouragements around the issue of domestic violence. NFL toughens domestic violence policy with six-game bans . There's even a hashtag campaign, #WhyIStayed. We know from experience, that staying in the public conversation is often the precursor to making true and lasting change. And we're hopeful that the NFL, and other professional sports leagues are recognizing that now is the time for a strong, enforceable policies that will not tolerate domestic violence or sexual assault. The first Violence Against Women Act didn't do nearly enough for the children who grow up in homes in which there is violence. It didn't do enough to help college students and other victims of rape, stalking and sexual assault. It didn't do enough for minority, immigrant and disabled communities, and populations with special needs. And it didn't do enough to promote prevention. NFL's past penalties for domestic violence 'a different story' With each subsequent re-authorization of the law, progress has been made -- but there's much more to do. We're convinced the country can finish the job. Vice President Joe Biden poured his heart and soul into passing the Violence Against Women Act 20 years ago and his commitment has never wavered. He was its proudest champion, winning crucial support on both sides of the political aisle. We still need him, and we still need a bipartisan group of dedicated congressional champions. Today, we both work with key federal agencies, large philanthropies, leading corporations and other partners that share our mission to finish what the Violence Against Women Act started. We need every one of them. There's still much too much violence against women, and our nation pays a huge price. We need to continue the progress for adult women, heal kids who are hurt, and show perpetrators that they have to be accountable for their actions. We need to engage the public and make men part of the solution. Passage of the Violence Against Women Act was a triumph of bipartisanship, and a moment in time when lawmakers had the clarity and courage to recognize that they could make an enormous difference on a problem affecting every community. It was a huge step forward for the country. Twenty years later, we should cherish and take enormous pride in this achievement -- and finish the job.

"(CNN) -- South Korea's $230 million National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (MMCA) opened in November with a towering ambition -- become what the MoMA is to New York and the Tate is to London. The museum couldn't be in a better location to attract attention -- it sits just across the street from Gyeongbokgung, Seoul's main royal palace, and adjacent to a neighborhood that's one of Seoul's most popular among tourists. Other than Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art, a private art museum owned by Samsung, Seoul has no other large museum housing Korean contemporary art. All of these factors have added up to put not just the art, but the new museum itself, under intense public scrutiny. ""There's an incredible anticipation from the art world here about which works will be shown and how the space will be used,"" says Gina Lee, a museum curator in Seoul. With South Korea anxious to maintain its world-class standing amid surging development in China and other regional rivals, the pressure for global recognition is particularly intense. ""As South Korea's only national art museum, one of our biggest missions is to showcase Korean art to the rest of the world, and to advance Korean art via various collaborations and exchanges with international institutions,"" says Young-in Lee, the museum's international affairs manager. Early controversy . One of the museum's first five showcase exhibits, Zeitgeist Korea (showing through April 27), drew early fire from critics of the museum. The problem wasn't the art itself -- the exhibit showcases modern Korean art, with 59 works by 39 Korean artists -- but the way it was selected. The Korean Fine Arts Association and other artist groups alleged favoritism -- 32 of the 39 featured artists are alums of Seoul National University's art school, from which the exhibition's curator and MMCA director Chung Hyung-min graduated. Chung withstood calls for her resignation, but, coming shortly after the museum's official opening, the protests marred what museum supporters intended to be a grand celebration. A close eye . Apart from a few projects sponsored by companies, including Hanjin Shipping and Hyundai Motor Co., the MMCA is funded mostly by the national government -- yet another reason for the intense scrutiny it's received since its very conception. Though some argue the museum has helped revitalize the neighborhood, proposals were met with numerous building restrictions, as well as protests against changes in the historic neighborhood. Since its opening, the reception from residents has been mostly positive. More than 160,000 people have visited the museum since the mid-November opening, and nearby cafes and stores teem with customers. ""It feels like there's a new cafe or restaurant or exhibit opening here all the time now,"" says Young Lee, 54, an art collector who's lived in the area for more than 30 years. ""The downside is, of course, the traffic."" It's difficult to believe Seoul hasn't been home to a national contemporary art museum for nearly 30 years. In 1986, the original art museum moved from a small Seoul building to a bigger space in Gwacheon, about 10 miles south, during the 1986 Asian Games -- it's taken nearly three decades to move back to Seoul. The primary catalyst for the new museum was former president Lee Myung Bak. During his administration in early 2009, Lee announced the transformation of a former military site into a place where the future of Seoul culture could be celebrated. Big ambitions . MMCA leaders hope to harness the star power of internationally acclaimed Korean artists to help thrust the museum into the global spotlight. ""If the museum can utilize the international attention that comes in these beginning stages, the pressure of the spotlight could be a major driving force,"" said Jae Seok Kim, editor of magazines Art in Culture and Art in ASIA. This is one of the reasons a work by Do Ho Suh, perhaps the most critically acclaimed living Korean artist, was chosen as the museum's central showpiece. Suh's 12-meter-high ""Home Within Home Within Home Within Home Within Home"" is housed in a 17-meter-high space called the Seoul Box. Transparent fabric has been shaped to resemble Suh's first American home in Rhode Island, while the traditional Korean building (hanok) inside represents his childhood home. ""A vital institutional mission is to function as a connecting bridge between the domestic and beyond -- we will put our best effort to introduce Korean art to the world outside and vice versa,"" MMCA director Chung said in a local interview. With no permanent collection, the museum is under pressure to deliver more than any other Korean contemporary art museum has ever before provided the city. ""In terms of scale, we are in line with with the MoMA and the Tate,"" says Soleh Choe of the MMCA Office of Development. ""We have also signed an exhibition contract with the Tate and will continue planning exhibits in the context of the global art scene."" New space . Architect Mihn Hyun Jun took an open approach to the new museum building, which spans 27,264 square meters over six floors (three above ground, three below), using skylights and expansive windows. ""When you walk in, the first floor is meant to be a comfortable public space,"" says Choe. ""Once you're inside, you can go down to B1 and enjoy the exhibitions."" The museum opened with five inaugural exhibitions: The Aleph Project; Connecting_Unfolding; Zeitgeist Korea; Birth of a Museum; and the Site-specific Art Projects. Suh's ""Home Within Home"" is the most visible, though the most popular exhibition to date has been The Aleph Project, which combines science, art and architecture to create a decidedly technical experience. Overall, the museum has a 60:40 ratio of Korean art to international art. It remains to be seen whether the museum's presence, or the exhibitions it brings in, will live up to the massive hype and expectations that have surrounded its opening. One thing is sure -- Koreans and art communities around the world will be paying attention to see if it does.

"Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- Heavy users of betel quids reveal their addiction when they smile. Their teeth are stained a reddish-black, dyed from years of chewing potent parcels of areca nuts and tobacco, wrapped in a lime-coated betel leaf. ""Some people after they eat they're drinking coffee or tea; always after eating I'm chewing the betel nut. I like it,"" says Myo Min Than, a 28-year-old noodle seller at a market in Myanmar's largest city, Yangon. Like tea or coffee, betel quids -- or ""nuts"" as they're often referred to -- give users a lift. But unlike tea or coffee, they also give them oral cancer. ""Having one is okay, but the danger increases when you start having the second one. When you reach a certain point, people will get cancer,"" said Professor Ying-chin Ko, vice president of China Medical University in Taiwan who conducted some of the first studies into the link between betel quids and oral cancer in the 1990s. A betel quid is the name given to small parcels that typically contain areca nuts, wrapped in a betel leaf coated with slaked lime. Some contain tobacco. Spices may be added for taste in different parts of Asia, including cardamom, saffron cloves and sweeteners, according to research compiled by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in its Monograph ""Betel-quid and Areca-nut Chewing"" (2004). Around 600 million people worldwide are thought to chew betel quids, making them the fourth most commonly used psychoactive substance after tobacco, alcohol and caffeinated drinks. They're predominantly chewed in Asia, where their use isn't limited to adults. You can see it in the research, and on the teeth of some children. In Myanmar, quids are popular with drivers who use them to stay alert on the road. U Sein, 37, chews around 10 quids a day. He's a taxi driver, and is stocking up at one of the many roadside stands in central Yangon. ""The tobacco is just like a drug,"" he said. ""So when I'm chewing the betel nut I get a bit dizzy."" He says he doesn't smoke cigarettes. Quids, he says, are ""better for me,"" though it's unclear whether he's referring to his health or the cheap cost of the addictive little parcels. A pack of three costs 100 Burmese kyat, around 10 U.S. cents. At least, that's how much seller Kyaw Thet, 26, charges at his stall in central Yangon. He's quickly wrapping new parcels while U Sein waits. Kyaw Thet can't say how many parcels he makes a day, but in a couple of minutes he's made six. He swiftly coats the leaves with lime before arranging them in rows and adding areca nuts and a sprinkle of tobacco. He flicks some more lime on before bagging them, and adds another sprinkle of tobacco for good measure. U Sein smiles as he hands over his cash, his teeth flecked that familiar shade of red. The chewing of areca nuts dates back centuries, as far as the bronze age, according to a study of remains excavated at Nui Nap, Thanh Hoa province in Vietnam, published in 2001. Researchers found the teeth appeared to be stained by betel quids. The practice has been around so long it's become an important part of cultural and religious rituals, and in some parts of Asia the parcels are used as a herbal remedy for anything from toothache to acne. Some also believe they have aphrodisiac properties. Scientific research has found that chewing betel quids leads to an increased risk of cancer -- whether or not tobacco is included. Carcinogens derived from tobacco and the areca nut were found in the saliva of people chewing the parcels, though it wasn't clear whether they were leaching from the tobacco or whether they were being produced during the chewing process. Ko thinks it's the latter. ""The leaves are fine, they will not cause cancer. Lime will not lead to cancer, but it may accelerate carcinogen to release. It's a hidden danger,"" Ko said. In some countries, authorities have launched awareness campaigns but health officials face an uphill battle in convincing addicts that it's not worth the buzz. In Taiwan, Ko says, ""People are aware, but it's just hard to get rid of the addiction."" Papua New Guinea recently introduced a ban on the sale and chewing of areca nuts in the capital Port Moresby, but that was mainly to rid the city of the unsightly red saliva users spit into the street when they chew. In Myanmar, the Consumer Protection Association, a non-governmental organization, has started trying to raise public awareness of the risks of betel quids, however its message is about the dangers of pesticides on leaves. ""Long ago, betel leaves were used as medicine but nowadays betel leaves cause oral cancer because of the excessive use of pesticides and insecticides,"" the association's chairman Bo Oat Khine told CNN. It's a theory that's not supported by any scientific evidence, Ko said. ""There's absolutely no relation between the two. Both areca nuts and leaves have very strong resistance to pests"" so neither are usually used during cultivation, he said. ""Earlier studies show pesticides may have a connection to lymph cancer or blood cancer, but never oral cancer,"" he added. Despite the evidence, noodle seller Myo Min Than has no plans to kick the habit. He says he needs his 10 parcels a day to stay awake during long shifts at his market stall, which start at 3 a.m. with a trip to the wholesaler, and end at 8 p.m. when he dumps his unsold stock. ""I'm working the whole day, it's a very long day, so when I'm chewing the betel nut I don't want to sleep,"" he said. Han Thar Nyein and Feng Ke contributed to this report.","Hundreds of millions of people chew betel quids, mostly in Asia .

"(CNN) -- North Korean state media has attempted to end the international speculation about the whereabouts of leader Kim Jong Un by publishing the first photos of him in more than a month. The North Korean leader gave ""field guidance"" to a newly built residential district and visited the Natural Energy Institute of the State Academy of Sciences, state news agency KCNA reported Tuesday. Kim hadn't been seen in public since he reportedly attended a concert with his wife on September 3. It's his longest absence from official events since he made his first public appearance in 2010, according to NK News, a website devoted to analyzing North Korea. In the undated photos, Kim was surrounded by officials and could be seen walking with a cane. He was smiling and didn't appear, in the photos at least, to be in pain. Before his disappearance, Kim was seen limping, prompting theories that he was suffering everything from weight gain to gout. Non appearance . His sudden disappearance took a concerning turn on Friday when he didn't appear at a events to mark the 65th anniversary of the Worker's Party of North Korea. In previous years, Kim has attended the Kamsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang to pay tribute to his father and grandfather. This year his name was absent from the list of attendees. Instead, KCNA reported that flowers were presented at the shrine in Kim's name. Kim's failure to appear fueled rampant speculation: Was there a power shift in the North Korean hierarchy? Could the young leader be ill? According to Dr. Kim So-Yeon, the former personal doctor to Kim's grandfather Kim Il Sung, Kim inherited a number of health issues, including psychological problems and a history of obesity. She told CNN both Kim Il Sung and Kim's father Kim Jong Il suffered from diabetes, heart problems and stress. After studying the photos, she said Kim's face appeared to have been swollen due to painkillers. And she also speculated that he has been receiving hormone shots to make him look more like his grandfather, the much-revered founder of North Korea. On Tuesday, U.S. National Security Council spokesman Patrick Ventrell said he could not confirm the KCNA report. ""We have seen these breaking reports but have nothing for you on their authenticity at this time,"" he said. Before this absence, Kim's longest disappearance from public view as Supreme Leader was 24 days between June 7 and July 1, 2012. His second longest absence was for 29 days between July 28 and August 27, 2011 -- while his father was still alive, NK News said. Kim's sole public appearance in September was at a Moranbong Band concert at Pyongyang's Mansudae Art Theatre, reported by state media on September 4. He was accompanied by his wife, Ri Sol Ju, his sister Kim Yo Jong and several top officials including Hwang Pyong So.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The Ebola virus is coming to the United States for what's thought to be the first time, as two Americans return home after getting infected while helping others cope with the outbreak ravaging West Africa. The first patient is expected to arrive in the United States on Saturday afternoon, U.S. officials said. The aircraft carrying that person will land at Georgia's Dobbins Air Reserve Base, then take off again for Liberia to get the second American infected with Ebola. Both are expected to head to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, according to Dr. Bruce Ribner, who oversees the special isolation unit where they will be treated. On Friday, he described the patients as ""stable"" and ""safe to transport."" There was an Ebola strain tied to monkeys -- Ebola-Reston -- in the United States during the 1990s, though no humans got sick from it, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Thus, what is happening now appears to be the first time a symptomatic person with Ebola will be in the country and treated at a U.S. hospital. The Emory unit -- created in conjunction with the CDC, which is based down the road -- that will care for these patients is designed to optimize care for those with infectious diseases while safeguarding health care workers and visitors. Emory's hospital is one of only four U.S. institutions capable of such care, according to Ribner. 'Training for this': Atlanta hospital ready . He pointed out many precautions in place to prevent the deadly virus from spreading. These include controlling everything that comes into and out of the unit, ""special air handling"" and windows and an intercom so guests can interact with patients without being in the room. As one of four physicians overseeing the patients' treatment, Ribner said, ""I have no concerns about either my personal health or the health of the other health care workers who will be working in that unit."" Ebola isn't ""some mystical pathogen (with) some bizarre mode of transmission,"" the doctor noted, adding that it is transmitted similarly to illnesses like SARS or HIV. But while the Emory staff members are confident, that doesn't mean they have experience dealing with Ebola, which the World Health Organization reports has infected more than 1,300 people and killed over 700 this year in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. In fact, no U.S. medical facility has had a known patient with the virus. That's because, as Ribner pointed out, ""this particular pathogen is new to the United States."" Evacuations trigger fear in U.S. After the evacuation plans became public Thursday, many Americans reacted on social media with fear and trepidation -- questioning why anyone would bring such a dangerous disease into this country voluntarily. ""The road to hell was paved with good intentions,"" wrote one person, using the hashtag #EbolaOutbreak. ""What do we say to our kids When they get sick& die?"" On the website of conspiracy talker Alex Jones, who has long purported the CDC could unleash a pandemic and the government would react by instituting authoritarian rule, the news was a feast of fodder. ""Feds would exercise draconian emergency powers if Ebola hits U.S.,"" a headline read on infowars.com. Ribner repeatedly downplayed the risk for anyone who will be in contact with Brantly or Writebol. The doctor noted the two patients -- Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly -- are both health care workers had put themselves at risk by going to Africa to help people in need. ""We have two individuals who are critically ill, and we feel that we owe them the right to receive the best medical care,"" Ribner said, adding that the two will have a much better chance being treated in the United States than in Africa. Still, even if Brantly and Writebol don't spread Ebola in the United States, others might. Many experts have said that other people will probably come to the country with Ebola at some point. It takes a while for symptoms -- which start out like many diseases, including common flus, with headaches, fever, nausea and diarrhea, then progress to abdominal pain and bleeding -- to break out. An infected person can get onto a plane feeling fine, then fall ill after landing. The fight against Ebola . For all the concerns about the United States, it's nothing compared to the harsh reality in West Africa. Ebola has been spread before in the past 40 years, but never like this. Dr. Margaret Chan, the head of the World Health Organization, on Friday described what's happening there as ""an unprecedented outbreak accompanied by unprecedented challenges."" Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC, said that even in a best-case scenario, it could take three to six months to stem the epidemic in West Africa. Chan noted that the virus is moving over porous borders, by plane. It has gone into rural areas where it's hard to get adequate treatment, as well as crowded cities where it can spread more easily. Worst of all, she said, ""This outbreak is moving faster than our efforts to control it. If the situation continues to deteriorate, the consequences can be catastrophic in terms of lost lives, but also severe socioeconomic disruption and a high risk of spread to other countries."" So what can be done? There is no standardized treatment; the most common approach is to support organ functions and keep up bodily fluids like blood and water long enough for the body to fight off the infection. Nor is there a vaccine, though one is in the works. The National Institutes of Health announced Thursday that it will begin testing an experimental Ebola vaccine in people as early as September. Tests on primates have been successful. The announcement came the same day the CDC issued a level three alert for Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, warning against any nonessential travel to the region. As of now, the outbreak has been confined to West Africa, but it is getting worse there. Although infections are dropping off in Guinea, they are on the rise in Liberia and Sierra Leone. In her statement, Chan said the calamity can be curbed, especially if the world steps up to provide equipment, experts, supplies and other resources for the most affected countries. ""Ebola outbreaks can be contained,"" she said. ""Chains of transmission can be broken. Together, we must do so."" Ebola doctor in Sierra Leone dies . What you need to know .

"(CNN) -- Thank you, David Chase, for not changing the ending. Earlier Wednesday, Vox ran a long profile of Chase that quoted him as saying that Tony Soprano, whose fate was left hanging in the show's famous, sudden cut to black, had lived. The news was, very quickly, everywhere. But it appears that the sphinx-like Chase was taken, perhaps, too literally. In a statement, his publicist said, ""A journalist for Vox misconstrued what David Chase said in their interview. To simply quote David as saying, 'Tony Soprano is not dead,' is inaccurate. There is a much larger context for that statement and as such, it is not true. ""As David Chase has said numerous times on the record, 'Whether Tony Soprano is alive or dead is not the point.' To continue to search for this answer is fruitless. The final scene of 'The Sopranos' raises a spiritual question that has no right or wrong answer."" Glad that's settled. Seriously. For seven years, viewers have puzzled about the scene that closed out ""The Sopranos."" In that finale, there were ominous portents afoot: a mysterious man in a Members Only jacket, daughter Meadow's cross against traffic to meet everyone at a restaurant. And Tony, despite having ended therapy with Dr. Melfi and beaten the New York mob, was still gripped by angst. So the cut to black, jarring and in the middle of ""Don't Stop Believin',"" was a shock. If we wanted some conclusion about Tony's life -- whether he lived or died -- it was going to go unresolved. Forever. It was perfect. It was perfect because ""The Sopranos"" was as much about the pointless details of life as it was about the classic arcs of storytelling. For every brutal whacking, there was a Russian escaping through the Pine Barrens. For every guilty verdict, there was a guy who didn't get caught. As Matt Zoller Seitz writes in New York magazine, "" 'The Sopranos' was never about ending mysteries, it was about recognizing and exploring the mysteries of everyday life: the mysteries of personality, motivation, conditioning and free will, as expressed through behavior and conversation and action, and as translated into metaphor through fantasies and dreams."" Yeah, maybe the cut to black didn't have the neat resolution of a pulp novel. But thematically it was of a piece with the rest of the series, which was always as much about uncertainty and the struggle for reconciliation as it was about mob justice. For years, Chase has refused to say what happened to Tony. Some critics thought it was his way of telling the viewers who loved the violence -- and ignored the more philosophical aspects of the show -- to go f*** themselves, to borrow a phrase. Chase didn't see it that way. He just thought it was unnecessary. That didn't stop fans from grasping at details as if they'd wandered into a Dan Brown novel. And this guy spent thousands of words and dozens of clips to arrive at his ultimate conclusion. Listen: Sometimes you die surrounded by loved ones, waiting for the light, exclaiming, ""Oh wow oh wow oh wow."" Sometimes your scarf gets tangled in a car axle and breaks your neck. But, most of the time, you just go on, trying to make sense of it all and never succeeding. Now that Chase has let the pendulum swing once again, let's hope it keeps swinging. To ""know"" the ending of ""The Sopranos"" is no more useful than knowing that Rosebud was a sled settles the meaning of ""Citizen Kane."" (Sorry, spoiler alert.) Some things are better left unsettled. Don't get any ideas, Matt Weiner.","David Chase gives interview in which he talks about end of ""Sopranos""

"(CNN) -- On any day, between 5 million and 6 million containers are on the high seas, carrying everything from potato chips to refrigerators. But not all of them make it to their destination, as the crew of the Svendborg Maersk have just found out. Their Danish-flagged ship was in the Bay of Biscay last week as hurricane-force winds battered the Atlantic coast of Europe. Amid waves of 30 feet and winds of 60 knots, the Svendborg began losing containers off northern France. After the ship arrived in the Spanish port of Malaga this week, Maersk discovered that about 520 containers were unaccounted for. Stacks of others had collapsed. It's the biggest recorded loss of containers overboard in a single incident. As repairs are made to the Svendborg in Malaga, Palle Laursen, Maersk's vice president of operations, says the company is examining its procedures ""to avoid similar incidents in the future."" The company told CNN that the extreme weather had an unexpectedly forceful impact on the ship's movements. It said 85% of the lost containers were empty and others included such dry goods as frozen meat. None contained dangerous goods. Maersk is now contacting customers to tell them that their shipments are at the bottom of the ocean. The Svendborg, which was on its way from Rotterdam in the Netherlands to Colombo in Sri Lanka via the Suez Canal, warned French maritime authorities that vessels should look out for floating containers, but most sank quickly in the mountainous seas. Thirteen have now been recovered, according to French officials. The French environmental group Robin des Bois said Friday it would sue Maersk for failing to disclose the full extent of the loss when it occurred, putting the lives of others in danger, causing pollution and abandoning waste at sea. The group claimed the containers were a lasting danger to fishing vessels and the environment. Most containers won't float for long, especially in heavy seas. But one that is refrigerated may be buoyed by its insulation, and the use of polystyrene as packaging for goods also aids flotation. New Zealand marine insurer Vero Marine says a 20-foot container can float for up to two months, and a 40-foot container might float more than three times as long. Cargo spills and shipping hazards . These rogue containers can pose a danger to shipping and pollute the environment. In 2006, thousands of bags of Doritos chips washed up on the beaches of North Carolina's Outer Banks -- much to the delight of local gulls -- after the container carrying them split apart in the Atlantic. More famously, in 1992, a container broke apart off the coast of Alaska, and 29,000 plastic ducks and frogs escaped. They've been washing up as far away as Scotland and Japan ever since. There is no requirement on shipping lines to report container losses to the International Maritime Organization or other international body, so no one seems to know how many containers are lost at sea every year. In 2011, the World Shipping Council estimated that including ""catastrophic losses"" such as the capsizing of a vessel, about 675 containers were lost at sea annually. The Through Transport Club, which insures 15 of the top 20 container lines, has put the loss at fewer than 2,000 containers a year. But other industry sources say the number may be as high as 10,000. That would still represent far less than 1% of the containers traversing the world's oceans. Maersk, one of the world's largest lines, says that its highest annual loss in the last decade was 59 containers. But the hazard is still real enough. In recent years, several small vessels have reported damage after hitting semi-submerged containers. During his solo voyage around the world, American sailor Paul Lutus wrote that ""one night in the Indian Ocean, I hit a waterlogged shipping container that was too low in the water to show up on radar."" His 31-foot boat was damaged but stayed afloat. Container weight an issue . Shipping analysts say that one issue affecting the stability of container stacks is that the steel boxes -- 20 to 40 feet long -- are not accurately weighed. They say some shippers frequently understate the weight of their containers to reduce freight charges. Not knowing how much your cargo weighs can introduce all sorts of problems in terms of the stress a vessel must endure at sea. Three years ago, a proposal was put to the International Maritime Organization for containers to be weighed before being loaded. But nothing has been agreed, and many shipping associations object to such a proposal as expensive and time-consuming. Even so, one current investigation may focus more attention on the loading of containers. Last June, the 90,000-ton MOL Comfort literally snapped in half 200 miles off the coast of Yemen. The ship, built in Japan, was only 5 years old. Both sections of the Comfort, as well as 4,500 containers, went to the ocean floor. One factor being investigated is whether uneven loading of containers contributed to intolerable stresses on the hull. It would not be the first such disaster. Seven years ago, the 62,000-ton MSC Napoli suffered catastrophic hull failure and ran aground off the English coast. A report by the UK Marine Accident Investigation Board concluded that inaccurate information about container weights could have been critical, given that cargo ships often sail close to their maximum permissible ""bending moments,"" which measure the external stress on a vessel. The investigation recommended that ""if the stresses acting on container ships are to be accurately controlled, it is essential that containers are weighed before embarkation"" and criticized the industry's ""overriding desire"" to maintain schedules and keep port time to a minimum. The cost of salvage and cargo came to nearly $200 million. An interim report into the sinking of the MOL Comfort by the Japanese Transport Ministry -- published in December -- also called for the weight of containers to be verified before loading to reduce uncertainty about ships' bending moments. But a definitive answer to the Comfort's demise may never be known, as much of the evidence lies deep under the Indian Ocean's waves.

"(CNN) -- New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton ordered an extensive review of the NYPD's training procedures after the death of Eric Garner, the man who was held in a choke hold and died while police attempted to arrest him, Bratton announced at a press conference Tuesday. After a two-hour meeting with NYPD Training Commissioner Ben Tucker on Tuesday morning, Bratton ordered a ""top to bottom review of all the training that this department provides to its personnel, specifically focusing on force, how do we train our officers for a takedown, how do we train them to use the various levels of force that they're authorized to use."" ""I would anticipate that coming out of this effort that there will be a re-training of every member of the New York City Police Department in the weeks, months and potential years ahead,"" Bratton said. Bratton also said a group of officers will go to the Los Angeles Police Department next week for further training. Bratton led the LAPD from 2002 to 2009 when it went through a ""phenomenal review"" of its force policies under the guidance of a federal judge. ""They probably have the most contemporary policies on use of force training that I seek to take advantage of,"" Bratton said. In addition, Bratton said he met with the assistant director for the FBI Tuesday morning to discuss their monitoring of the incident. Bratton also said that based on his experience with similar matters he would not be surprised if the U.S. attorney decided to open a civil rights violation investigation. A vigil was held for Garner on Tuesday evening and the NYPD was to assist with the funeral on Wednesday morning in Brooklyn. Confronted by police trying to arrest him for allegedly selling illegal cigarettes, Garner raised both hands in the air and, with passive defiance, told the officers not to touch him. Seconds later, a video shows the officer behind him grab the 350-pound man in a choke hold and pull him to the sidewalk, rolling him onto his stomach. ""I can't breathe! I can't breathe!"" Garner said repeatedly, his cries muffled into the pavement. The video of the July 17 skirmish shows the Staten Island man lying on the ground motionless after the incident. An asthmatic, Garner was later declared dead at a nearby hospital, according to CNN affiliate WCBS. Police said he suffered a heart attack and died en route to the hospital. ""This is a terrible tragedy that occurred. ... A terrible tragedy that no family should have to experience,"" said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, calling the video of the incident ""very troubling."" Police said that 43-year-old Garner, a father of six, had a lengthy criminal history, including more than 30 arrests, and had been previously arrested for selling untaxed cigarettes in May. Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who is seen on the video choking Garner, was put on modified assignment and stripped of his badge and gun as the New York Police Department continues to investigate the incident, WCBS reported. The choke hold tactic is prohibited by the NYPD. Opinion: What led to choke hold death . Two EMTs and two paramedics have been suspended without pay, Erika Hellstrom, vice president of development at Richmond University Medical Center, said in an e-mail. In a statement, Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Patrick J. Lynch called Pantaleo's reassignment ""a completely unwarranted, kneejerk reaction for political reasons."" He said the move ""effectively pre-judges this case and denies the officer the very benefit of a doubt that has long been part of the social contract that allows police officers to face the risks of this difficult and complex job."" On July 19, Garner's friends and family rallied alongside the Rev. Al Sharpton in Upper Manhattan, demanding a full investigation into Garner's death, according to WCBS. Garner's wife was set to speak at the rally but found herself too emotional, WCBS reported. New York photographer Joel Graham was at the demonstration, which lasted for two hours. He shared his photographs with CNN iReport, and said he captured them while walking alongside protesters who traveled from New Brighton Church to the store where the choke hold incident took place. ""This crowd was composed of good, well-meaning people who understood that peace was the only option and were adamant that things remain calm over Eric's death. I have been to protests that have been violent, but this crowd reflected who Eric was,"" he said. Graham, an area resident, had a familiar relationship with Garner. ""I am an urban art photographer, and I will talk to everyone on the streets of New York City,"" he said, explaining that he would occasionally chat with Garner while taking photos near the Staten Island Ferry. ""I had empathy for Eric and how he must have felt trying to catch his breath, and sympathy for the family. This was a heartfelt emotional protest because everyone loved Eric,"" he said.

"Khumbu Valley, Nepal (CNN) -- Italian climber Claudio Tessarolo has been at Mount Everest base camp for the last 10 days, waiting to find out if his attempt to summit the world's highest peak can go ahead. He says it's been 10 days of rumors -- 10 days of watching other expedition teams make the difficult decision to leave, one by one. This morning, he and his team finally decided to pack up and follow them. ""For once, the local people decided about Everest,"" he says. I've been climbing towards base camp through the Khumbu Valley for the last five days. Helicopters have been a constant presence, breaking the beautiful silence that lovers of the mountains treasure. They carry negotiators to Kathmandu, officials to base camp and climbers back home. On the ground, I cross paths with yak caravans, ascending empty and descending with full loads. ""Why is everyone leaving?"" a German climber asks me. ""There is still one month of opportunity before the monsoon arrives."" Despite conflicting reports to the contrary, the mountain is still open. The government has not issued any prohibition against climbing, releasing a statement on April 24 encouraging expedition teams to go ahead with the season. But support for this season's climb has trickled away, day after day, since the April 18 avalanche that left 13 guides dead and three missing -- the deadliest accident in the history of the world's highest peak. A group of about 50 people, mostly Nepali Sherpas, were hit by the avalanche at more than 20,000 feet just above base camp in the Khumbu Ice Fall. Sherpas, an ethnic group from Nepal's Himalaya region famed for their climbing prowess, aren't officially stopping anyone from attempting the risky journey, though hundreds involved in the lucrative Everest trekking industry have refused to climb. ""Without the Sherpas we cannot climb and there is nothing we can do about it,"" says Tessarolo. ""We made Everest a circus. This year the Sherpas decided that the show will not go on."" Sherpas open the route on the Nepali side of Everest, through the treacherous Khumbu Icefall. They fix the climbing lines all the way to the summit of Mount Everest, transport the equipment to make camp, climb next to their clients while carrying their oxygen and food, and rescue those in danger. Without their assistance, making the long, dangerous journey is nearly impossible for all but the most experienced of climbers. Everest avalanche: American climber recounts how Sherpa saved his life . Mixed feelings on canceled season . It wasn't a unanimous decision by Nepal's Sherpa to abandon the season -- there's no unanimous motive. Some don't want to climb because they're in mourning -- a sign of respect for their friends who died in the avalanche and their families. Others don't want to climb for religious reasons. The Sherpa spiritual code of conduct, which interconnects humans and nature, has been violated, they say. To put it simply, the gods are angry. Some refuse to climb for political reasons: they want better insurance from the Nepal government and scholarships for their children. Some don't want to climb because of safety: there have been several avalanches reported since the tragedy. There have even been reports of threats of violence to climbers who try to continue. It's still possible, according to some reports, to find guides willing to take you to the summit on the northern, Chinese side of the mountain. But in Nepal the season is looking bleak. Discovery calls off coverage of Everest wingsuit jump . 'How will I convince my wife to let me go away again?' The Nepal government makes about $3 million from royalties on Everest each spring season. More than 330 foreign climbers had been given permission to climb Everest over the next couple of months, with an estimated 400 guides helping them, spending between $40,000 and $90,000 each in their attempt to scale the mountain. The short window, May 15-30, is usually the best time to make an attempt to reach Everest's peak. As discussions took place on the fate of the Everest season last week, many climbers left base camp to continue their acclimatization process on other mountains in the region. ""When we went back, we found base camp empty,"" says Bae Young Rok, a South Korean member of the Kyungil University Alpine Club. ""There is nothing we can do but leave as well."" He says the Nepalese government told him his Everest climbing permit will remain valid for the next five years. ""That's fine, but how will I convince my wife to let me go away again for two months?"" One of the reasons an Everest expedition takes so long is the time required for multiple rotations up and down the mountain to help the body adjust to the thin air, says professional climber Alan Arnette (who summited Everest in 2011) on his blog. ""A typical Everest climber will spend 10-15 days sleeping high on the mountain above Base Camp before going on their summit attempt,"" he says. ""They sleep at ever-increasing altitudes to trick the body into making the necessary physiological changes, especially with respect to respiration, the key to survival at extreme altitudes."" Sherpas seek better employment opportunities . On the route to base camp I meet Tsering Sherpa, who is making his way down from base camp. ""I am ready to climb,"" he says. ""I want to stand by my clients; it is their decision whether to climb or not."" He says the leader of his team called the expedition off on Monday. ""He told us that the icefall is too risky."" Some teams left earlier out of respect for their Sherpa, many of whom work on climbing expeditions only because they don't have access to better economic opportunities. They make up to $6,000 per season and usually get a summit bonus if their clients reach the top of the 8,848-meter (29,020-feet) mountain. It's a stark contrast to what drives the foreign visitors to climb. ""In our time the best job available was climbing; it's not anymore,"" says Natang Sherpa, who owns the Moonlight Lodge in Namche Baazar, a popular acclimatization village among tourists. Her daughter is now a medical doctor living in the United States. ""Tourists asked me how long have I been a Sherpa. I am a Sherpa since I was born! Some of us become porters and climbers, most of us, luckily, can avoid it [nowadays]."" Other Nepalese ethnic groups are starting to replace the Sherpa, as they manage to secure better jobs. Among the 16 people dead or missing in the April 18 tragedy, three are from other ethnic groups. Mount Everest climbing season up in air after avalanche deaths . Only a handful remain . For the few still hanging on in base camp in the hope of making the summit, their chances get slimmer with each day that passes. The Khumbu Icefall moves one meter per day: the ladders are lost, the lines broken. None of the camps on the mountain itself are operative, I'm told, and nobody has reached Camp 3 yet -- one of four camps set up on Everest en route to the summit. Nobody is left to do the heavy work for the foreign climbers, and most have come to the realization over the last few days that climbing is not a possibility for them. Until the late 1970s, only a handful of climbers reached the top each year. The number topped 100 for the first time in 1993. By 2004, it was more than 300. In 2012, the number was more than 500. The deadliest year on Everest was 1996, when 15 people died. Another 12 climbers were killed in 2006. Everest climbers, widower recount deadly traffic jam on top of the world .

"(CNN) -- Almost one week after he was hospitalized with a urinary tract infection, soccer legend Pele's condition is continuing to improve, but he remains in an intensive care unit. The 74-year-old was taken off kidney dialysis Sunday, the Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo said. Pele's condition will be re-evaluated Monday to see if further dialysis is needed. The hospital said he is lucid. Pele, who was born Edson Arantes do Nascimento, was admitted to the hospital November 24. He had recently undergone surgery at the same facility to remove kidney stones. The athletic icon had one kidney removed during his days as a player, his aide Jose Fornos Rodrigues told CNN. Pele tweeted Thursday that he was looking forward to spending the holidays with family and starting ""the new year with renewed health, with many international trips planned."" ""I am blessed to receive your love and support,"" Pele said, ""and thank God this is nothing serious."" Known as ""The Black Pearl"" and ""The King,"" Pele is one of the best known names in all of sports. He burst onto the scene as a teenager, helping lead his native Brazil to the 1958 World Cup championship. Pele went on to star on two other World Cup title teams, in 1962 and 1970. He also had a breakthrough career with the Brazilian club Santos and later with the New York Cosmos of the now-defunct North American Soccer League. In 2000, Pele and Argentina's Diego Maradona were named co-Players of the Century by FIFA, the international soccer governing body. Even after retiring from soccer, Pele has remained in the public eye as a product pitchman, ambassador for the sport of soccer and advocate for Brazil's poor, having grown up as one of them in the inland city of Tres Coracoes.

"Seoul (CNN) -- A helicopter carrying emergency workers involved in the Sewol ferry disaster operations crashed Thursday in a South Korean city, fire officials said, leaving five dead and one injured. The helicopter came down in an urban area in the southwestern city of Gwangju, according to Gwangju and Gangwon Fire Headquarters. Video footage from the scene showed what appeared to be the aircraft's wreckage blazing on a city sidewalk near a stop light, with high-rise buildings only yards away. The firefighters and rescue personnel on board were on their way home after spending the past four days supporting the search of the ferry, an official with Gangwon Fire Headquarters said. At least 292 people, including more than 200 high school students, died after the ferry sank in April. Eleven people remain missing. The dead included two pilots, two rescue workers, and one mechanic, the official said. The helicopter crashed after taking off from a refueling stop at a Gwangju airport. The cause of the incident is not yet known. The Sewol ferry was headed from Incheon to Jeju island on April 16 when it capsized. Most of the passengers were high school students on a field trip.

"(CNN) -- A comet is speeding toward a close-encounter with Mars. Comet Siding Spring is expected to come within 87,000 miles of Mars at about 2:27 p.m. ET on Sunday -- very close for a comet flyby. The space rock is moving at about 126,000 mph (56 kilometers per second). NASA thinks the comet will miss the Red Planet, but comets spew out a trail of dust and gas, and that could damage the fleet of spacecraft orbiting Mars. ""Mars will be right at the edge of the debris cloud, so it might encounter some of the particles -- or it might not,"" Rich Zurek, chief scientist for the Mars Exploration Program at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said in a press release. ""It only takes a half-a-millimeter-sized particle traveling at 56 kilometers per second to injure one of these spacecraft,"" Don Yeomans, manager of the Near Earth Object Program Office said in a NASA video. Just to be safe, NASA will move the Mars Odyssey orbiter, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), and the new Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) to the other side of the planet as the comet approaches. ""We're going to hide behind Mars,"" said Rob Lock, Orbiter Studies Lead in the Mars Program Office. ""Kind of like diving under your desk if there's an earthquake and flying glass around."" See NASA's YouTube video explaining comet flyby . The orbiters will take pictures and collect data on the comet as it zips by.

"(CNN) -- The days of memorizing arcane, recondite vocabulary words might be ending for high school students who will take a redesigned SAT in two years. An emphasis on ""relevant,"" commonly used words is one of many changes the College Board unveiled Wednesday in an attempt to make the 88-year-old exam ""more open and clear than any in our history."" With fewer questions overall, the new test aims to assess students' analytical skills and better help them prepare for college. ""Recent SAT results tell a troubling story about students' readiness for and likelihood for success in their postsecondary endeavors,"" the College Board said. ""Far too few students are ready to succeed in the kinds of education and training that they will need to participate effectively in an increasingly competitive economy."" The College Board released 211 pages of detailed test specifications, including sample questions to show how the test is changing. Here's a look at some examples across all sections: . The new test will have fewer questions overall that are scored differently: . Multiple-choice questions will contain four answers instead of five. Instead of a point for each correct answer and a deduction for an incorrect answer, the new test will use ""rights-only scoring,"" which means a point for a correct answer, but no deduction for wrong answers. Blank responses will have no impact on scores. In a return to previous versions, the test will be scored on a scale from 400 to 1600 instead of the current scale of 600 to 2400. With 153 questions -- 52 in reading, 44 in writing and language and 57 in math -- the new test will have fewer questions than the current version's 171 questions. But, there will be no more mandatory essay, leading to the next big change. The written essay will be optional and scored separately from reading, writing and math: . It's optional in the sense that individual postsecondary institutions will determine whether they will require it for admission. Those who take it will have twice as much time -- 50 minutes -- to complete it. Instead of asking students to take a position on a presented issue, the new version aims to evaluate reading, writing and analytical skills by asking students to produce a written analysis of a provided source text. For example, the College Board documents provide a passage and asked students to write an essay explaining how the author ""builds an argument to persuade his audience"" by looking for ""evidence, such as facts or examples, to support claims,"" or stylistic elements, ""such as word choice"" to add power to the ideas expressed in the passage. No more $5 words! ""Relevant words"" are in: . Instead of requiring students to memorize words they might never use in real life, questions in the new test will focus on understanding the meaning of ""relevant"" or commonly used words from the context in which they appear, and ""how word choice shapes meaning, tone, and impact."" Here's an example: . ""The coming decades will likely see more intense clustering of jobs, innovation, and productivity in a smaller number of bigger cities and city-regions. Some regions could end up bloated beyond the capacity of their infrastructure, while others struggle, their promise stymied by inadequate human or other resources."" As used in line 55, ""intense"" most nearly means . A) emotional . B) concentrated . C) brilliant . D) determined . The test will ""focus on math that matters most -- algebra: . What matters most, according to the College Board, is algebra, data analysis and what it calls ""passport to advanced math,"" which includes quadratic and higher-order equations, geometry and trigonometry. Students will have 80 minutes -- 10 minutes longer than the current version -- to answer 57 math questions. Most will be multiple-choice but some will require students to provide answers. And, unlike the current version, students will be required to put away their calculators for 25 minutes. Students will have to analyze texts based on the strength of the writer's arguments . Students will be asked to demonstrate their ability to interpret and synthesize the underlying ideas of a variety of sources, from informational graphics and political speeches to fiction novels and scholarly texts. One sample question asks students to read a political speech and determine which lines support the overall argument.","Emphasis on ""relevant,"" commonly used words is one of many changes in new SAT .

"(CNN) -- A grisly murder-suicide in the upscale Brisbane neighborhood of Teneriffe has shocked residents of the Queensland city. Mayang Prasetyo, an Indonesian living and working in the city, was allegedly murdered by her boyfriend, Marcus Peter Volke, who later took his own life, local media has reported. After residents complained of smells similar to ""dog food"" and ""rotting meat"" emanating from the couple's apartment, police investigated. Upon entry, officers found human remains, a Queensland Police Service (QPS) statement said. Police said they found ""various body parts"" cooking in chemicals, according to reports. Further remains were found in garbage bags. Police have yet to formally identify either Prasetyo or Volke. ""Post mortems are being conducted at present and results won't be released for a couple days, only after that time will they officially identify the deceased,"" a QPS communications officer told CNN. Volke, a chef, fled the street-level apartment when police arrived at the scene. His body was later found in the neighborhood. He appears to have died of a self-inflicted wound, reports said. Tributes poured in on Prasetyo's Facebook page, with friends describing her as an ""amazing soul"" and a ""happy, cheerful person."" Prasetyo, a transgender cabaret dancer, met Volke on board a cruise ship that they both were working on. Australian media reported that she was working as a ""high class prostitute"" and using her earnings to fund the education of family members in Indonesia. Voke's mother told Brisbane media that he and Prasetyo were ""starting to get settled"" in Brisbane after an itinerant life aboard cruise ships. The Brisbane Times reported that Volke was an ""outspoken opponent"" of violence against women, and animal cruelty. His hometown newspaper, the Courier in Ballarat, Victoria, however, quoted an unnamed schoolmate describing Volke as ""always a little different. He wasn't a happy-go-lucky guy like the rest of us -- he was a bit dark."" He did not have a criminal record or history of mental illness, and authorities have not released a motive for the murder.","Authorities are investigating an apparent murder-suicide in an upscale Brisbane suburb .

"(CNN) -- On April 8, 1988, when he was 16 and long before he became a model, rapper and actor, Mark Wahlberg -- high on drugs and alcohol -- assaulted a man while trying to steal two cases of alcohol and then punched another man in the face as he attempted to avoid the police. He was arrested, sentenced and tried as an adult, and he served 45 days in prison. Today, at 43, Wahlberg is a much different person -- a father of four, a successful movie star, a philanthropist who works with at-risk youth -- but says he's still legally affected by his convictions. In a petition submitted Monday (PDF), he's asking for a pardon. ""I am deeply sorry for the actions that I took on the night of April 8, 1988, as well as for any lasting damage I may have caused the victims,"" he writes in the petition. ""Since that time, I have dedicated myself to becoming a better person and citizen so that I can be a role model to my children and others."" Wahlberg says his record ""can potentially be the bases to deny me a concessionaire's license in California and elsewhere,"" something important to him because of his interest in Wahlburgers, a restaurant he hopes to expand. Moreover, he says, ""given my prior record, Massachusetts and California law prohibit me from actually obtaining positions in law enforcement,"" which he says prevents him from becoming ""more active in law enforcement activities."" Wahlberg has frequently acknowledged his troubled past. In July, he told CBS News that he draws on his experiences in his acting. ""I have a lot of real life experience that I can draw on,"" Wahlberg said. ""And I think that shows in the characters that I play because I'm always trying to find somebody -- or find characters to play that I can identify with on a personal level or relate to. And I think it makes for a little bit more of an honest portrayal."" He added, ""Once I got a second chance, I was never going to do anything to mess it up."" In the petition, Wahlberg notes that in 2001 he started the Mark Wahlberg Youth Foundation, which has donated $7 million to various youth causes, and he's very active in the Boys & Girls Club. News reports have noted that Wahlberg left some details out of his pardon. As his sentencing memorandum states, he made a racial slur to the first man he hit and continued with such speech after he was arrested. One victim was left blind in one eye, according to an ABC News report. Wahlberg admits that his reasons for asking for a pardon go beyond just having certain legal rights smoothed out. ""The more complex answer is that receiving a pardon would be a formal recognition that I am not the same person that I was the night of April 8, 1988,"" he writes. ""It would be formal recognition that someone like me can receive official public redemption if he devotes himself to personal improvement and a life of good works."" The pardon would also be a message for troubled youths that ""they too can turn their lives around and be formally accepted back into society,"" he adds. Some observers have been skeptical of the request. ""Even if Wahlberg is not the same person anymore, he was that person at one point, and if he's seeking a pardon the full version of how he acted is what should be judged,"" wrote the Boston Globe's Austin Tedesco. Commenters on Boston's WBZ's ""Daily Talker"" were harsher. ""Why him and not numerous others who have turned their lives around? Has he made amends to the victim?"" wrote jockstevens. ""Ah, no. It wouldn't be fair to others in the same situation,"" wrote the flip side. Wahlberg's case will be reviewed by the parole board, which will pass its recommendation to Gov. Deval Patrick, who will make the final decision pending approval by the eight-person Governor's Council. CNN's Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.","Mark Wahlberg served prison time for committing assault when he was 16 .

"Washington (CNN) -- After appearing briefly on the Obama administration's short-list to run the Pentagon, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson now has to survive a congressional grilling on the president's new immigration policy. Testifying before the House Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday, Johnson said he is ""fully comfortable"" that President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration reform is within the President's legal authority. Johnson helped draft the President's plan to shield up to 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation and will make undocumented criminals a priority for deportation. ""Many of these individuals have committed no crimes and are not enforcement priorities. It is time that we acknowledge this as a matter of official policy and encourage eligible individuals to come out of the shadows, submit to criminal and national security background checks, and be held accountable,"" Johnson told the committee. Republicans on the committee, starting with Chairman Mike McCaul, questioned the authority and timing of Obama's executive action on immigration and the impact of Obama's action on illegal immigration. ""The President's unilateral actions to bypass Congress on Nov. 20 undermine the Constitution and threaten our democracy,"" McCaul, R-Texas, said in a statement before the hearing. McCaul questioned the timing of Obama's decision to act on immigration reform, which came after the midterm elections, calling it ""more of a political decision than a policy decision."" Johnson would not comment on Obama's statements before he decided to use his executive authority on immigration, when Obama suggested he may not have the authority to act unilaterally to reform the immigration system. Instead, Johnson stressed that administration officials ""spent months"" with lawyers to ensure all executive actions on immigration are legal and said the White House was repeatedly urged by members of Congress to hold off on executive action for months. And the incoming chair of the House's top oversight committee Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz hit Johnson with a ""gotcha"" question during his speaking time. Johnson found himself at odds with a statement Obama made just last week during an immigration speech while responding to hecklers . ""What do you say to someone who believes the President took action to change the law?"" Chaffetz said. ""We did not change the law,"" Johnson replied before Chaffetz played the clip of Obama at the event last week, saying: ""What you're not paying attention to is I just took an action to change the law."" ""So you say he didn't change the law, but the President says he changed the law,"" Chaffetz said. ""Somebody plays me an eight-word excerpt from a broader speech, I know it to be suspicious,"" Johnson retorted to laughter. Johnson rejected Rep. Lamar Smith's claims that Obama's immigration action would lead to a surge in illegal immigration, insisting that the order will prioritize recent illegal migrants. ""Recent arrivals are priorities for removal,"" Johnson said. ""Wherever I go I intend to highlight the fact that these new reforms prioritize recent illegal entrance."" The Obama administration had placed Johnson on a short-list to replace outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. But an official said Tuesday that Johnson is no longer in contention for the job. Johnson stressed that he wants to work with Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform, but another Republican Rep. Jeff Duncan said the issue is ""a lack of trust of the American people in the administration to enforce the laws."" ""Why would you pass another law when the administration fails to enforce the current laws that are on the books. Why pass another one that's not going to be enforced either?"" Duncan said. ""I think congress can pass a bill when the American people start regaining trust in the administration to actually to their job and enforce the laws that are already on the books."" Johnson pushed back and pinned the lack of a comprehensive bill on Congressional inaction. ""The President has said that would be his preference. The problem is we have no partner in Congress,"" Johnson said.","Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson testified on Capitol Hill on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration has issued a final decision to reclassify sunlamp products and ultraviolet or UV lamps used in indoor tanning salons. The federal agency has changed the labeling requirements from low-risk to moderate-risk devices. They are also requiring the products carry a black box, visible to consumers, that states the products should not be used on people under age 18. Although a black box is the FDA's strongest warning, this does not outlaw or restrict these devices for minors. According to the FDA, the lamps emit UV radiation that may cause skin cancer. The American Academy of Dermatology says studies have shown people who have been exposed to UV rays from indoor tanning have a 59% increase of developing melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer. ""The FDA has taken an important step today to address the risk to public health from sunlamp products,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. ""Repeated UV exposure from sunlamp products poses a risk of skin cancer for all users, but the highest risk for skin cancer is in young persons under the age of 18 and people with a family history of skin cancer."" Representatives for the Indoor Tanning Association, which represents indoor tanning manufacturers and distributors across the country, said they believe the FDA is responding to pressure from certain interest groups to put stronger regulations on indoor tanning beds. ""I just don't think the science is there,"" said John Overstreet, executive director of the association. ""I think it's blown out of proportion. We are obviously disappointed in the FDA's latest moves."" The association's website promotes indoor tanning's ""well-known side effect"" of exposing skin to UV light as producing more vitamin D, which ""plays an important role in maintaining good health."" It suggests the ""health benefits of indoor tanning deserve further research."" In 2009, the World Health Organization classified tanning beds as ""carcinogenic to humans."" Skin cancer experts say it is about time these changes be put into effect. ""For years we have watched more and more people being diagnosed with melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. Today the Food and Drug Administration made a decision that may turn that trend around, "" said Tim Turnham, executive director for the Melanoma Research Foundation. ""Like the tobacco industry, tanning salons market an addictive product disproportionately to teenagers and young women, playing on common insecurities."" ""The FDA's decision to more strictly regulate tanning beds will save lives and serve as a valuable resource in efforts to slow down the increasing rate of melanoma, particularly in the young. By classifying tanning beds as Class II devices, tanning salons will now be required to demonstrate they are properly maintaining their equipment,"" he said. Noting this is a good first step, other dermatologists said they hope the FDA will do more. Dr. George Verghese, director of Mid-Atlantic Skin Surgery Institute in Waldorf, Maryland, said he sees far too many patients at the practice with skin cancer. Many of them made tanning beds a regular habit. ""Those who use tanning beds on a regular basis, especially teens, have 10 times the risk of developing all three types of skin cancer, including melanoma, which is deadly,"" Verghese said. ""My youngest melanoma patient was 18. She was using tanning beds since she was 13. She has a huge scar on her back and is constantly being monitored. I think there should be restrictions on these devices for those under the age of 18, because teens don't understand the consequences, especially when they use the beds frequently,"" Verghese said. ""I feel the black box will help, but there needs to be more restrictions put into place."" Even though there has been a push for the FDA to restrict people under 18 from using tanning beds, the FDA said that is not what the latest changes are about. ""That is an action (restricting teens from using tanning beds) we are willing to consider,"" said Nancy Stade, deputy director for policy at the Center for Devices and Radiological Health at the FDA, ""But this is not what we are addressing today."" ""Restricting teens' access to indoor tanning is critical to preventing skin cancer. As medical doctors who diagnose and treat skin cancer, dermatologists are committed to reducing its incidence and saving lives,"" said Dr. Brett M. Coldiron, a board-certified dermatologist and president of the American Academy of Dermatology Association. ""Therefore, we will continue to communicate to the FDA the need for stricter regulations on the use and sale of indoor tanning devices for minors under the age of 18.""","FDA changes label requirements for sunlamps and UV lamps .
The FDA reclassifies them as ""moderate-risk devices"" instead of ""low-risk""

"Washington (CNN) -- A government report obtained by CNN on Friday states that government agents and lawyers mistreated Monica Lewinsky when they approached the former White House intern in January 1998 to get her to cooperate with an investigation into President Bill Clinton. The report, which was first reported by the Washington Post's Rosalind S. Helderman, notes that while ""no lawyer involved in the confrontation with Monica Lewinsky committed professional misconduct,"" the encounter ""could have been handled better by all of the OIC lawyers involved."" Read the full report here. At the center of the government report is what happened after FBI agents and lawyers from the Office of Independent Counsel, who at the time was investigating the affair with Clinton, approached Lewinsky at a food court and moved the conversation to a hotel room nearby. The counsel -- which was led by Ken Starr -- was investigating Clinton for a number of issues, including his extramarital affair with Lewinsky. ""Associate Independent Counsel Michael Emmick confronted Lewinsky with her false affidavit and other criminal activities relations to the Jones case,"" the report states. ""In an effort to gain her cooperation, Emmick told her she could be prosecuted on multiple criminal charges, but said if she cooperated, the OIC would take it into account in charging decisions."" In doing so, however, the agents and lawyers denied Lewinsky attempts to speak with her lawyer, Frank Carter. ""Because they feared she would want to call Carter,"" the report -- which was posted online by the Post -- states, ""OIC lawyers devised a deliberate strategy to discourage her from doing so."" One way of doing that was telling Lewinsky that contacting the lawyer would ""get less value for her cooperation."" To sum up the confrontation, the report -- which was ordered by Robert W. Ray, Starr's successor -- states: ""On the slippery slope, Emmick did not stop."" The National Archives provided CNN with the report and Spokeswoman Laura Diachenko said the reason this report was able to be released - but other from the Starr investigation were not - was because the report was not clearly marked as sealed. ""If the Special Counsel report authored by Jo Ann Harris was considered sealed by the Special Division, it should have been clearly marked to indicate its status. It was not,"" Diachenko said in an emailed statement. ""If the report was marked as under seal, it would not have been released."" The release of the 2000 report on Lewinsky comes at a time when the former White House intern has stepped back into the public eye after more than a decade of trying to be private. Lewinsky delivered her first high-profile speech since the affair at Forbes' 30 Under 30 summit on Tuesday and earlier this year Vanity Fair announced that the former White House intern was a contributor to the magazine. Since then, Lewinsky has penned pieces on cyberbullying and her life after the Clinton affair. At the Forbes appearance, Lewinsky spoke at length about her confrontation with agents and lawyers that was detailed in the government report. ""It was just like you see in the movies,"" Lewinsky said of the encounter. ""Imagine, one minute I was waiting to meet a friend in the food court and the next I realized she had set me up, as two FBI agents flashed their badges at me."" She added: ""Immediately following, in a nearby hotel room, I was threatened with up to 27 years in jail for denying the affair in an affidavit and other alleged crimes. Twenty-seven years. When you're only 24 yourself, that's a long time. Chillingly, told that my mother too might face prosecution if I didn't cooperate and wear a wire... My friends and my family were subpoenaed to testify against me."" The government report - titled the ""Report of the Special Counsel Concerning Allegations of Professional Misconduct By the Office of Independent Counsel in Connection with the Encounter with Monica Lewinsky"" - substantiates Lewinsky's story. ""For nearly twelve hours, the OIC lawyers were in a hotel room with this hysterical but very focused young woman,"" reads the report. Lewinsky, however, never cooperated with the investigation. And while Clinton was impeached by the House, the Senate acquitted the president of the House charges in 1999. OPINION: Shame on Monica Lewinsky .

"(CNN) -- A retired American doctor who was working with Ebola patients in West Africa returned to the United States -- and put himself in quarantine. Dr. Alan Jamison volunteered in the Liberian capital of Monrovia this month as part of an international medical group. He returned to the United States on July 25, according to Medical Teams International, the organization he worked with. MTI declined to discuss details of how Jamison traveled back to the United States, including whether he was on a commercial flight. Jamison, 69, said he's had no symptoms of the deadly virus, but has been in seclusion since he returned to his hometown of Morristown, Tennessee. He plans to be in isolation for 21 days, which is the incubation period for the disease -- or the time between infection and onset of symptoms. ""My last encounter with a patient who had Ebola was on July 19,"" he said. ""I contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on my arrival ... and informed them I had been in West Africa and my history."" The father of three said his daughter picked him up from the airport and dropped him at home, where he's quarantined himself and has had no contact with anyone since. ""I'm feeling normal and doing the typical things a person would do in their home,"" he said. "" I have my family who can bring me food if I need anything, and they would not enter the house. They can leave items outside the home."" Ebola spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions of infected people. Patients are only contagious when they show symptoms, not during the incubation period, according to the World Health Organization. ""I was not concerned that I was contagious when I left Africa, and not concerned at this time because I have no symptoms of the disease,"" Jamison said. The retired pediatrician said he was volunteering with Medical Teams International. ""It was very stressful and emotional to see these things in Liberia,"" Jamison said. Liberia is one of three nations battling an outbreak of Ebola. The World Health Organization says Ebola has been confirmed or suspected to have infected more than 1,300 people, with more than 700 deaths in West Africa this year. So far, the disease has been confined to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. One man died in quarantine in Nigeria after leaving Liberia. Two American medical workers infected in West Africa will receive treatment in Atlanta. Dr. Kent Brantly arrived in Georgia on Saturday aboard a specially equipped plane and was taken to Emory University Hospital. The plane is headed to Liberia to retrieve the other American, fellow missionary Nancy Writebol. The treatment of the patients will be conducted under strict safety protocols, U.S. officials said. There's no cure for Ebola. The most common approach is to support organ functions and keep up bodily fluids such as blood and water long enough for the body to fight off the infection. Despite the risks, Jamison said he'd return to West Africa to help combat Ebola. Questions about the Ebola outbreak .","Dr. Alan Jamison says he volunteered in the Liberian capital of Monrovia .

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors will be allowed to present more gruesome evidence against a former Bosnian Serb military commander who has been on trial for genocide since 2012. A United Nations-backed International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia announced Thursday that the court will hear details about a mass grave investigators believe has ties to Ratko Mladic. Investigators discovered the site in 2013 in the village of Tomasica, a haunting reminder of the bloodshed wrought by the conflict that followed the breakup of the former Yugoslavia two decades ago. The former commanding general of the Bosnian-Serb forces is accused of leading a campaign of ""ethnic cleansing,"" widespread killing, torture, forced labor and physical, sexual and psychological violence during the Bosnian war. More than 400 remains recovered at the Tomasica site are suspected to be of Bosniak and Croat ethnicity from Prijedor and its surroundings -- people killed in summer 1992, according to the Prosecutor's Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the international tribunal. In 1992, Mladic led the siege against Sarajevo, which killed thousands of people, including civilians, and lasted more than two years. He also spearheaded the attack on the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica, where an estimated 7,000 men and boys were killed. In 1995, the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia indicted the ex-commander, along with 51 others, on charges of war crimes and atrocities. By the time an international arrest warrant was issued for him and he finally turned himself in, Mladic had gone into hiding and wasn't apprehended until 2011. Read more: Mladic arrested and jailed . In July 2011, a tribunal judge entered not guilty pleas for Mladic after he refused to cooperate and was forcibly removed from the courtroom at the judge's order. His trial began in May 2012.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea came from a goal down to beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield and open up a commanding lead at the top of the English Premier League Saturday. Spain international Diego Costa scored the winning goal midway through the second half after a much improved Liverpool took an early lead and can count themselves unlucky after having a goal disallowed and strong claims for a penalty waved way. Two coaches, two stories . Both coaches had publicly aired their frustrations about recent performances before the match, albeit for very different reasons. Chelsea coach Jose Mourninho has seen his side dominate this season's Premier League whilst playing at a canter. But he was critical of Chelsea's past few performances, especially this week's lackluster draw against Slovenian champions Maribor in the Champions League. Liverpool coach Brendan Rodgers has far deeper problems to deal with. After coming so close to winning the title last season with a rampant Luis Suarez, Liverpool has endured a slow start as new signings like Mario Balotelli and Dejan Lovren struggle to settle in. But it was Rodgers's decision to rest key players against Real Madrid in the Champions League that had provoked a storm of criticism. Liverpool lost that game 1-0, with a much improved performance, which some saw as a sort of vindication for Rodgers. Yes we Can . So it was with some surprise that only one player drafted in for that game at the Bernabeu kept their place, a move that paid almost immediate dividends. After a fast paced, high quality opening exchange, German midfielder Emre Can drifted in and fired Liverpool into the lead after his shot took a wicked deflection off Gary Cahill. Cahill would soon get his chance to make amends after smuggling home a lose ball following a Chelsea free kick into the penalty area. Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet managed to get something on the shot before taking it over the line. From the naked eye it would have been almost impossible to see whether the ball had crossed the line. But within seconds referee Anthony Taylor had given the goal thanks to newly-introduced goal line technology. Chances . Both teams had chances -- Mario Balotelli had the ball in the back of the net but it was ruled offside -- before Chelsea began to take control of the game and Costa fired home after good work by Ceser Azpilicueta on the left. Yet Liverpool will count themselves unlucky not to have won a penalty after Cahill was again involved in another controversial moment in the game. Replays showed that he clearly handled the ball in the penalty area. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard -- whose slip in the corresponding fixture last season effectively ended Liverpool's title chase -- was apoplectic that a penalty had not been given, but to no avail. A ""clear"" penalty . ""It was a clear one,"" Rodgers told BT Sport after the game. ""We worked so hard in the game, we need those decisions. It was quite obvious. It hits his hand, it was a clear, clear penalty, and the referee has a clear view of it. The players gave everything and we deserved at least a point."" A typically modest Jose Mourinho, on the other hand, focused on Chelsea's fine performance away from home, claiming that the penalty incident was ""too far for me"" to see. ""The victory is very much deserved,"" he added. ""I know that some people say that Liverpool didn't play so well. I would disagree. They tried everything, but Chelsea was the best team."" Chelsea extend lead, briefly . The win saw Chelsea extend its lead at the top of the Premier League to seven points, but only briefly. Second place Southampton beat Leicester 2-0 to cut Chelsea's lead back to four. The Saints have been the Premier League's surprise package this season, going on an incredible run winning 25 out of an available 33 points under new coach Ronald Koeman. Elsewhere another Dutchman enjoyed a good day at the office. Louis Van Gaal's rebuilding of Manchester United continued with a narrow 1-0 victory against Crystal Palace. Spain international Juan Mata scored the only goal of the game after coming off the bench. Austin v Hart . In the final Premier League game of the day, the champions Manchester City took on lowly Queens Park Rangers in west London amid torrential rain. And it was a torrid first half that saw QPR have two goals disallowed within a minute, both by the same player. Whilst striker Charlie Austin's first was rightly disallowed for offside, the second was more controversial. From the resulting free kick from the first disallowed goal, City goalkeeper Joe Hart passed the ball straight to Austin who slotted the ball home again. But the goal was ruled out thanks to an obscure, but correct, reading of the rules. An official had spotted that Hart had accidentally kicked the ball twice, with the first touch not leaving the penalty area. It meant the ball was not technically in play leaving the Loftus Road crowd collectively stunned. A few minutes later Austin made it third time lucky when he finally broke the deadlock and put QPR into a well deserved league. Premier League top scorer Sergio Aguero leveled the score, despite being both offside and handling the ball in the build up, before a late Martin Demichelis own goal appeared to have handed QPR an unlikely victory. But Aguero scored his second of the game and secured City a point.","Chelsea beats Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield.

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- When Aung San Suu Kyi arrived in Thailand, she had only her doctor and security man with her. The rest of her entourage had gone on ahead to establish operations around the country for what is proving to be a whirlwind and exceptionally busy trip. It began this morning in the blistering heat of Mahachai, the center of Thailand's fishing and seafood industry, a nondescript town of canneries and fish markets. By the time we arrived, a couple of hours before Suu Kyi was due, the two stopping-off points of her trip were already thick with thousands of Burmese waiting to catch a glimpse of the Myanmar opposition leader, who is making her first trip outside the country in more than 20 years. Burmese migrant workers dream of return home . At the fish market, with not a breath of wind and a powerful smell of shrimp in the air, they waited patiently, clutching flags and pictures of Suu Kyi and her father, former prime minister Aung San, the man who liberated what was then known as Burma from British rule. When she arrived it was chaos. Suu Kyi was not expected to get out of the car -- her people had been told it may be too dangerous because of the crowds -- but she did anyway, to the delight of her compatriots. At the community center nearby the crowds were much bigger, thousands strong, and chanting her name and singing the national anthem. Young men, women and families mingled, laughed and sweat under the searing sun. When she arrived she initially could not get out of the car because of the crowds and was taken down a side alley where she could get into the community center. Moments later, to an ecstatic crowd, she appeared on a third-floor balcony to tell her supporters that she would not forget them and that she would fight for their rights. The effect was electric as her words hit home. Many smiles turned to tears of joy -- such is the hope these Burmese migrants have of returning to their homeland and a job. Inside, Suu Kyi spoke to community leaders and workers. Each told a story of the trials they faced. After 40 minutes it was time to move on, to return to the capital and a busy schedule of meetings. She spoke to the media only briefly, saying she would not take questions but instead outlining what she had heard from her people. Her commanding presence in an outdoor public arena is only amplified inside a room. In all, her visit lasted just about three hours. Not long, but long enough to send a very clear message that her new-found travel freedom will be used to push democracy and human rights for Myanmar harder than ever. Suu Kyi will be back in Yangon by the end of the week. Next stop, Europe.","Thousands of Burmese migrants in Thailand gather to see Aung San Suu Kyi .

"Dhaka (CNN) -- Bangladesh has smashed a record set by Pakistan last year by forming the world's largest human flag, Guinness World Records has confirmed. Tens of thousands of Bangladeshi students and armed forces held up red and green colored placards in Dhaka's National Parade Ground last month to create the huge Bangladeshi national symbol. The formation broke a record set in October 2012, in Pakistan, when 24,000 people assembled a flag in the city of Lahore. On December 16, a total of 27,117 people held the flag together for at least five minutes, following instructions provided by Guinness World Records. ""This is the first time our nation is breaking a record like this with Pakistan,"" said Akhika Akhtar, a 17-year-old student who heard about the event from her professors. The date was chosen to celebrate Bangladesh's Victory Day, according to an event organizer, Toffael Rashid. Victory Day commemorates the day Bangladesh officially gained independence from Pakistan on December 16, 1971, after a nine-month war that left between 1 million and 3 million people dead. An accounting firm oversaw the record-breaking attempt and submitted materials to Guinness World Records, which verified the record.","Bangladesh sets new record for world's largest flag .

"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) -- Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, favored to win re-election and a historic sixth term in November, credits his famous facial hair for his political success. ""I've never lost, and I've always done it with a mustache, so I'm going to keep it,"" he told me. First elected governor in 1982 at the tender age of 36, he went on to serve four terms, stepping down in 2000. But he came out of retirement six years ago and rode a GOP wave back into office. If voters return him to office this fall, the 67-year-old will have served over 20 years as governor, making him the longest-serving executive in American history. One reason for Branstad's winning streak is that he's much more of a hardball politician than his aw-shucks Midwestern demeanor suggests. Earlier this year, Branstad, the definition of an establishment Republican, successfully deployed his political machine in an effort to reclaim the Iowa GOP from the clutches of tea party leadership. So far this year, in his race against Democrat Jack Hatch, he's been able to weather administration scandals and accusations of corruption. One Democrat told me that for Iowa voters, Branstad is ""like an old sweater"" — just the comfortable choice. Obamadale: The secret weapon that could save Iowa Democrats? Branstad was talking about his whiskers while giving me a private tour of the picturesque Iowa state capital for the latest episode of ""Hambycast,"" showing off the knick-knacks and ceremonial gifts that decorate his hideaway office, normally off-limits to reporters. He pointed proudly to his hunting trophies, a photo with Pope John Paul II, and an Iowa Hawkeyes football jersey with ""BRANSTAD"" emblazoned on the back. Upstairs in the state capitol, we examined baseballs signed by players who had jogged the bases at Field of Dreams in Dyersville. Then we were guided up to the very top of the gilded state capitol for a stunning autumn view of downtown Des Moines. As the talk turned to 2016 and the looming parade of Republican presidential contenders set to march through Iowa, Branstad brushed off criticism that the caucuses favor uncompromising social conservatives over more moderate Republicans. Hambycast: Hillary Clinton's madcap media mob . He has a point. Mitt Romney, not exactly a favorite son of the Christian right, almost won the caucuses. There's a sizable pool of mainstream Republicans here waiting to be courted, and in a crowded presidential field, a candidate can win the state with a plurality — and without unified support from social conservatives. ""You need to come here early and often,"" Branstad said, invoking the example of Rick Santorum, who came out of nowhere to win Iowa after campaigning in the state's 99 counties (and, it should be noted, after wearing his conservative Catholic faith on his sleeve). Branstad would not say if he would endorse a candidate but said he's favorable to Republican governors — no surprise there — a comment that should warm the hearts of Chris Christie, Rick Perry, Scott Walker and Mike Pence. Jeb Bush heading to 2016 primary state . As for the (in)famous Ames Straw Poll, that media-saturated, oft-criticized and nonbinding summertime test of candidate support, Branstad backed away from previous suggestions that the fundraiser should be scrapped. I asked him if the GOP-run Straw Poll will actually happen next summer in the run-up to the caucuses. Branstad said maybe, but floated another option. ""It's going to depend on the candidates and who is willing to participate,"" he said. ""I think having a series of fundraisers regionally around the state would be a good alternative.""","Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad is vying for a historic sixth term .

"(CNN) -- Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has signed into law a ban on same-sex marriage in Africa's most populous nation. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry slammed the decision Monday. ""Beyond even prohibiting same-sex marriage, this law dangerously restricts freedom of assembly, association and expression for all Nigerians,"" he said in a statement. ""People everywhere deserve to live in freedom and equality. No one should face violence or discrimination for who they are or who they love."" Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, characterized the law as a ""big setback for human rights for all Nigerians."" According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), the bill passed by the Senate at the end of last year introduces a 14-year prison sentence for people who are convicted of entering into a same-sex marriage or civil union. It also reportedly makes it an offense to administer, witness or help at a same-sex marriage ceremony. NAN said the law also forbids people from running gay clubs, societies, processions or meetings in Nigeria. The punishment for such acts is 10 years in prison, it said. And the law even states that marriages or civil unions from outside the country will be void inside the country, according to NAN. Last month, Uganda's parliament passed controversial legislation that would make some gay acts punishable by life in prison. For the bill to become law, it would need the signature of that county's president, who has 30 days to make a decision. Homosexuality is illegal in most African nations based on remnants of sodomy laws introduced during the British colonial era and perpetuated by cultural beliefs. Punishments across the continent range from fines to years in prison. Worldwide, a growing number of countries now allow same-sex marriage, the majority of them in Europe. The Netherlands was the first, in 2001, and it was later joined by Belgium, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Portugal, Denmark and France. A bill to allow same-sex marriage in England and Wales is also now law, though it isn't expected to come into force until later this year. French court rules mayors cannot block same-sex marriage . Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand and South Africa are the non-European countries in the group, according to the Pew Research Center. Same-sex marriage is also legal in some parts of Mexico and the United States. CNN's Christian Purefoy, Marilia Brocchetto and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.","Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan signs the bill into law .

"Washington (CNN) -- Top Democratic strategists in Washington are already beginning one of the city's oldest traditions -- second-guessing a losing election strategy before what is expected to be a stinging defeat in Tuesday's midterm elections. One of the key debates to emerge is whether Democratic candidates were too cautious in avoiding President Barack Obama at all costs. ""Running away from the president is never smart,"" said one top Democratic strategist who has worked with both the White House and Senate candidates this midterm cycle. ""You look like chicken s---,"" the strategist added on condition of anonymity. A White House official who also asked not to be named so he could speak freely argued Democrats still have a chance to hold the Senate. ""We don't think anything is done until election day,"" the official said in an email that included election day polls in 2012 that showed the president tied with Mitt Romney. Obama went on to win a decisive victory. Still, the conventional wisdom to banish the president from key Senate battlegrounds, in favor of either Bill and Hillary Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden, and even First Lady Michelle Obama made sense to most Senate Democratic campaigns. The president's low approval numbers plus the conservative terrain at risk for Democrats in Arkansas, Alaska and Louisiana was a ""toxic combination,"" as another top strategist put it. The problem with that approach, according to Democratic midterm second-guessers, is that it left the party with little to offer voters. ""I am becoming convinced that many Democrats made a mistake in trying to run away from President Obama and the Democratic party agenda,"" said Jim Manley, a former spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. ""How is the base supposed to get excited when elected Democrats are going to such great length to put as much distance as the can between them and a president that was elected twice by the American people,"" Manley asked. One of the lasting memories of the 2014 midterm elections will likely be Kentucky Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes' refusal to say whether she even voted for Obama. ""She was an Obama delegate,"" complained one strategist about Grimes. ""Of course she voted for him."" The president did not want to tell candidates how to run their campaigns, his aides said. Instead, Obama appeared almost exclusively with Democratic gubernatorial candidates. But his message was clearly aimed at firing up his party's base. Obama has consistently prodded Democrats to get off the couch, take their cousin ""Pookie"" with them, and vote. Democrats, the president has argued time and again, have a ""congenital defect"" when it comes to casting ballots in midterms. ""The number of eligible voters who vote typically in a midterm is like in the 30s. I mean, Ukraine just went through an election -- they got a war going on, they had about 60 percent turnout,"" Obama said Sunday of the percentage of Americans who go to the polls in midterm elections. ""There is no excuse for us to just give away our power. If you wonder why things don't happen, if you wonder why sometimes elected officials don't seem responsive, it's because so many of us stay at home,"" he added at an event with Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf. Despite that feisty tone, Obama remained behind closed doors Monday, one day before the midterms. Also missing are any mentions of the president's record. Obama no longer uses the line about his polices being ""on the ballot"" on Tuesday, after some of his supporters complained publicly. But other strategists worry the aversion to all things Obama went too far, noting few Democratic candidates have spent much time pointing to the lowering unemployment rate, among a range of hopeful economic indicators. ""Many Democratic candidates blurred the choice so much that voters figured 'well if I'm going to have a choice between two Republicans I might as will choose the one that calls themselves one,'"" griped a party operative. Candidates also matter, several seasoned Democratic operatives argued. Iowa Democratic Senate candidate Bruce Braley's gaffe in describing the state's popular Republican Sen. Charles Grassley as an ""Iowa farmer who never went to law school,"" was a key mistake according to one strategist. A Braley loss to his Republican challenger, Joni Ernst, would give the GOP two Senate seats in a state Obama won twice, after he defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Iowa caucuses. In a sign of just how much his Iowa star power has faded in six years, the president was never called in to campaign on behalf of Braley. In addition, the president was kept out of Colorado and New Hampshire, two states he also captured in 2008 and 2012. Ben LaBolt, a former Obama White House and campaign spokesman, maintained Democrats are striking the right balance. ""It makes little sense to publicly deploy him in states he didn't win,"" LaBolt said. ""However, he can and is doing surgical things to help Democratic candidates like fundraising and rallying the young and diverse constituencies that carried him to victory and could make the difference in close races.""","Some Democratic strategists think candidates tried too hard to avoid the president .
President Barack Obama has a sagging approval rating nationally and in key states .
That said, some on the left think running away from a sitting president is a losing strategy .

"(CNN) -- Despite government claims of a ceasefire, gunmen believed to be Boko Haram fighters attacked two villages and a town near the border with Niger, killing at least 8 and kidnapping others, residents told CNN Saturday. Boko Haram has not yet responded to the government's announcement Thursday of a ceasefire, which an official said heralded peace in the country after some five years of conflict with the Islamic extremist group. In one attack, militants ambushed travelers in the Borno state village of Shaffa, residents of the area said, killing eight people and abducting others. Boko Haram gunmen also stormed the village of Waga in Adamawa state, abducting a number of residents, including women, residents there told CNN. Insurgents also occupied the town of Abadam, near Niger, after killing an unknown number of residents in their attack, residents said. Nigerian officials said Friday that the government had reached a ceasefire agreement with Boko Haram, which has been waging an insurgency in the country's north since 2009. The deal, the government said, includes the release of more than 200 kidnapped girls whose abduction from their boarding school shocked the world in April. The deal, first reported by Agence France-Presse, came Thursday night after a month of negotiations with representatives of the group, said Hassan Tukur, principal secretary to President Goodluck Jonathan. Nigerian officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby, according to Tukur. ""We have agreed on the release of the Chibok schoolgirls, and we expect to conclude on that at our next meeting with the group's representative next week in Chad,"" Tukur said. Doyin Okupe, a government spokesman, said the ceasefire deal was meant not only to free the girls but also to end the insurgency. ""On the war front, we can say there is peace now,"" he said Friday. What is Boko Haram? A source involved in talks with the militants told CNN last month that Nigerian government officials and the International Committee of the Red Cross had discussions with Boko Haram about swapping imprisoned members of the group for the more than 200 schoolgirls. It is unclear, however, whether the deal includes a prisoner swap. The name ""Boko Haram"" translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language. The militant group is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. As part of its insurgency, the militant group has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike. Where are the missing girls? CNN's Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.","At least 8 killed in attacks on two villages near border with Niger .

"(CNN) -- It's a good bet that right now, someone somewhere in Washington has come up with a plan to decapitate the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) by assassinating its boss, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and moving down through his lieutenants. Argued in hushed tones over a polished conference table, I have no doubt this sounds like a no-lose proposition (and certainly a better alternative to invading Iraq and Syria). But if ISIS is in essence al Qaeda 2.0, then it is hard not to see the assassination of Osama bin Laden as having had very mixed results -- and as holding some important lessons for U.S. policy makers. The fact is that assassinations are, at best, tricky -- the cure can be worse than the disease. And a cure is almost certain to fail when you have absolutely no idea what the disease is that you're treating. It may comfort us to dismiss ISIS as a group of bloodthirsty terrorists doomed to collapse under their own psychosis and violence. But while ISIS does of course employ terror as a tactic, getting hung up on the word ""terror"" causes us to miss a more critical truth: that ISIS is a straight-line manifestation of an aggrieved religious sect -- orthodox Sunni Islam. And it's becoming more apparent by the day that a lot of Sunni Muslims believe they're on the losing end of history, and that if they don't hit back, things will get a lot worse. Indeed, Sunnis, despite making up the large majority of Muslims globally, haven't fared well in recent times. The 2003 invasion of Iraq dispossessed the Sunnis in that country of both their power and wealth. Insult was added to injury when the United States handed power over to a sectarian Shia government bent on revenge against the Sunnis. We can go on all we like about democracy and the rule of law, but the way the Sunnis view it is that we wantonly empowered their Shia rivals. Sunnis aren't doing much better anywhere else. The minority Alawite regime in Syria -- the Alawites are a Shia offshoot -- continues to slaughter large numbers of Sunnis. Another Shia offshoot sect in Yemen recently took over Sana, the capital. And for the last decade, the American drone campaign over Pakistan's tribal belt has never let up, ""breaking the back"" of al Qaeda and the Taliban.We may dismiss them as terrorists, but for a small but growing number of Sunnis they're the closest thing they have to a resistance group. Even in solidly Sunni Egypt, the military is doing its best to crush the Muslim Brotherhood, the beating heart of political Sunni Islam. An international aid worker who's negotiated with ISIS on hostage releases recently told me that militant Muslims look at their predicament in the starkest of existential terms, namely that that the United States is out to destroy Islam. They're convinced the U.S. deliberately caused the death of 300,000 Muslims in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and in retaliation for 9/11, and that it won't stop until the Sunnis start to fight back. Everything to know about the rise of ISIS . There is of course no American conspiracy against Sunni Islam. But the point is that ISIS is rooted in an embattled religious sect that's had enough. Call it a Sunni intifadah, if you like -- a lashing out in frustration and fear. The fury of the impotent. But, unlike the Palestinian intifada against Israeli authority, this one promises to be more enduring and disruptive, if for no other reason than a resurgent Sunni Islam is bound to run headlong into Shia Islam, and along with it the real possibility of a hundred-years war. While most Sunnis may want nothing to do with ISIS's apocalyptic jihad, coexisting with the Shia is less and less appealing to them. A year ago, when ISIS started to move across the border from Syria into Iraq, I took the pulse of a couple Sunni Iraqi tribal sheiks and officers from Saddam Hussein's army, asking them why they didn't drive them back into Syria. After all, they have the arms and people to do it. Did they really want to live side by side with frenzied jihadists and risk Baghdad strafing them with American-supplied Cobra helicopters? Who is the ISIS? Their uniform response was that they would ally with anyone, including the madmen of ISIS, to drive the Shia government of Baghdad out of Sunni areas. They added that secession from Shia Baghdad was all but inevitable. Some said that if history favored them, they would unite with the Sunnis of Syria to form a single nation. As for ISIS and the jihadists, they would turn on them when the time came. Letting the jihadists serve as your spearhead may sound risky to us, but what it tell us is that the divide between Iraq's Sunnis and Shia is truly unbridgeable. To be sure, we're capable of militarily destroying ISIS and eliminating its leadership. But Sunni grievances will remain -- and there will always be another Sunni strongman to take up the cudgel. Which brings me to this: the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement gave the world the Middle East's modern borders. Drawn up in secret by French and British colonial administrators, those borders had -- and still have -- nothing to do with cultural and ethnic realities. This begs the question of whether it is really in our interests to defend artificial borders by waging endless war and campaigns of political murder. The fact is that we are likely living what amount to the final agonies of the Ottoman Empire. If that's the case, drone assassinations and targeted killings will get us absolutely nowhere.","Political assassinations are at best tricky, writes Robert Baer .
Some Sunnis may see ISIS as resistance group, not terrorists: Baer .
Middle East borders have nothing to do with cultural and ethnic reality, he says ."
"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- When Ken Umeano went to watch the summer sci-fi blockbuster ""District 9,"" he stormed out after 30 minutes. ""District 9"" was directed by South African filmmaker Neill Blomkamp, who also co-wrote it. ""I was so angry,"" said Umeano, a Nigeria native living in Atlanta. ""They were showing Nigerians as corrupt, eating aliens, saying they have sex with aliens. I could not watch that."" The movie set in South Africa is a story about an alien space ship that breaks down over Johannesburg -- leaving the stranded creatures in a fierce battle with humans. In the film, Nigerians jump at an opportunity to exploit the aliens, who are being kicked out by their South African hosts. A Nigerian gangster provides the aliens with a range of paid services including prostitutes, food and weapons. The depiction has sparked an outcry, including a Facebook group condemning its portrayal of Nigerians. Officials in the West African country have banned it and are demanding an apology from Sony Pictures, the film's principle distributor through Tri-Star Pictures. ""Why do they want to denigrate Nigerians as criminals, cannibals and prostitutes who sleep with extra-terrestrial animals?"" said Dora Akunyili, information minister. ""We've had enough with the stereotypes they have branded us with ... we are not going to sit back and allow people to stigmatize us."" The movie will not be shown in Nigeria unless Sony apologizes and edits out any references to the country, she said. Sony pointed out that Nigerian authorities cleared the film for release, and it screened in that country for two weeks. ""'District 9' is a work of science fiction, and no offense was intended toward any country or person,"" the company said.  Watch how the film reflects South Africa's former apartheid » . The film was directed by South African filmmaker Neill Blomkamp, who also co-wrote it, and it was adapted from Blomkamp's 2005 short, ""Alive in Joburg."" ""Lord of the Rings"" producer-director Peter Jackson produced ""District 9."" Sony's involvement was limited to distribution. Malawian actor, Eugene Khumbanyiwa, 33, who plays the top Nigerian gangster, defended his role in the movie. ""I was just doing my job as an actor,"" Khumbanyiwa said. ""My job was to play a character as an underworld gangster and I did ... I'm just going to run away from this whole controversy."" Khumbanyiwa said the outcry was a surprise because his Nigerian co-stars did not have an issue with it. The scenes depicting Nigerians make up less than 10 minutes of the 113-minute film. In some places, Nigerians are shown trying to eat alien flesh to cure illnesses and acquire superhuman powers. Khumbanyiwa's character is named Obesandjo -- which Akunyili said is an attack on former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo. Some Nigerians said the movie feeds off stereotypes associated with the country. ""Everyone has this image of Nigeria,"" Umeano said. ""A lot of people have given Nigeria a bad name, but that does not mean the whole country is bad."" While Clement Nyirenda believes the director should have used a fictional country, he said the outcry is much ado about nothing. After all, he said, the Nigerian movie industry, Nollywood, is filled with the same characterizations. ""The (Nollywood) movies show Nigerians as witch doctors, corrupt, a lot worse,"" Nyirenda said. ""Nigeria is mostly known for 419 scams ... the government officials should focus on cleaning the image."" The term ""419 scams"" refers to spam e-mails that ask for money and bank information. Akunyili said the country is trying to ""rebrand itself away from such images."" The Nollywood industry is undergoing a makeover, too, she added. ""District 9"" made $73 million in its first 10 days. Blomkamp, who grew up in Johannesburg, told CNN last month that he didn't want the sci-fi tale about aliens and apartheid to be defined by politics. ""I didn't want to go, 'Here's a whole bunch of people oppressed by this apartheid-esque society' and beat people over the head with it,"" Blomkamp said. ""I rather wanted to say this is the city I grew up in, this is what it felt like."" CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.","Film is about an alien space ship that breaks down over Johannesburg, South Africa .

"(CNN) -- Publicly, New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez has maintained he never took performance-enhancing drugs from a clinic in Miami. But privately, he confessed he did, according to a story published Wednesday by the Miami Herald. Rodriguez reportedly admitted in late January to using steroids, facing prosecutors and federal agents who gave him immunity. The Miami Herald said it had reviewed a 15-page synopsis of Rodriguez's meeting. ""Yes, he bought performance-enhancing drugs from Biogenesis of America, paying roughly $12,000 a month to Anthony Bosch, the fake doctor who owned the clinic,"" the article stated. ""Yes, Bosch gave him pre-filled syringes for hormone injections into the ballplayer's stomach, and even drew blood from him in the men's room of a South Beach nightclub. ..."" When contacted by CNN, a spokesman for Rodriguez, Ron Berkowitz, declined to comment on the report, which details Rodriguez's involvement with the now-defunct Biogenesis anti-aging clinic in Miami. According to federal officials, Bosch, the founder of that clinic, dispensed performance-enhancing drugs to professional baseball players and to impressionable high school athletes in South Florida and teenagers in the Dominican Republic. He surrendered to the Drug Enforcement Administration in August. The investigation led to the suspension of 14 players for violating the league's drug policy. In addition to Rodriguez, Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun, the 2011 National League MVP, was suspended. Rodriguez was initially given a 211-game suspension. The penalty was later reduced to 162 games, but he still missed the 2014 season. A lawyer whose client is accused of conspiring with Bosch to distribute steroids to high school athletes issued a statement on the Miami Herald story. ""I can for your report confirm that the report by the Herald is accurate as to what Rodriguez said. I don't have a dog in this fight. My client has no involvement with any major league players concerning the use of banned substances,"" said attorney Frank Quintero.

"(CNN) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has urged Ukrainian government forces and rebel fighters to respect a fragile ceasefire following the death of a Swiss Red Cross worker in shelling in eastern Ukraine. The humanitarian worker, identified as Laurent DuPasquier, 38, by the International Committee of the Red Cross, was killed when a shell landed near the ICRC building in the city of Donetsk. Ban said he was ""saddened and disturbed"" to learn of the death, which came a day after 10 civilians were killed in the shelling of a Donetsk school, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. ""The Secretary-General is seriously concerned over the dangerous surge in fighting in recent days and mounting civilian casualties,"" a statement from Ban's office said. ""These recent, tragic incidents underscore the fragility of the current ceasefire and the importance of ensuring a secure environment in south-eastern Ukraine that will allow humanitarian actors to carry out their work and deliver critical assistance to those most in need."" The ceasefire deal was agreed upon September 5 in Minsk, Belarus, following talks between representatives of Ukraine's government, Russia and rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine. A subsequent agreement September 19 in Minsk set out more measures. Ban called for all sides to stick to their commitments under the deal and to redouble their efforts toward a lasting peace. ""A return to full-scale fighting could be catastrophic for Ukraine, the region and beyond,"" he warned. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, in a phone call with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, also called for the ceasefire to be maintained and for a halt to the shelling in the city of Donetsk, the Foreign Ministry said. 'Deeply shocked by this tragic loss' Didier Burkhalter, the OSCE chief and Swiss foreign minister, urged all sides to stop fighting immediately and observe the ceasefire -- which the OSCE has been monitoring -- and to implement the measures agreed upon in Minsk. To put the ceasefire at risk ""would be irresponsible and deplorable,"" his office said. Civilians in eastern Ukraine urgently need a return to peace and stability, Burkhalter said, and humanitarian agencies in the region need to be able to help them before the onset of winter. The Red Cross has about 20 staff members in Donetsk, five of them international, the ICRC said. DuPasquier had been with the organization for five years but had arrived in Ukraine only six weeks before his death. ""We are deeply shocked by this tragic loss,"" Dominik Stillhart, the ICRC's director of operations, said Thursday. ""We understand that there were other civilian casualties in Donetsk today. Indiscriminate shelling of residential areas is unacceptable and violates international humanitarian law."" Finger-pointing . The Russian Foreign Ministry appeared to point the finger at Ukraine's government over DuPasquier's death and called for a thorough investigation. In a statement Friday, the ministry said it had noticed ""a fidgety reaction of the Kiev authorities that were in a hurry to shift from themselves responsibility for the death"" of the ICRC staffer. ""Kiev was unwilling to recognize the evident facts -- militias have under their control the district in Donetsk that came under shelling when the fire was opened from the positions held by Ukrainian troops,"" the statement said. However, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry accused rebel fighters, which it calls terrorists, of responsibility for the attack, according to national news agency Ukrinform. ""This terrorist attack has no excuse. Bandits and terrorists in an inhuman way dared to take up arms against those who arrived in Donbas with a humanitarian mission -- to help people,"" a ministry statement reportedly said Thursday. Donbas is a term used to refer to eastern Ukraine. ""This case is in the same plane with terrorists taking OSCE employees hostage and is also directed at intimidating international organizations that help restore peace and calm in Donbas,"" it said. Airport battle . Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council said that Donetsk's airport remained at the center of military activity Thursday, with fighting ongoing. ""After two attacks with tanks and Grad missiles, militants stormed the airport four times yesterday. Our troops heroically kept the defense,"" it said. The military body said rebel fighters also had directed artillery, mortar and small-arms fire at Ukrainian forces near four towns in the Donetsk region. One Ukrainian soldier was killed and 18 injured in the past day, it said. Kiev and the West accuse Russia of supporting and arming the rebels as well as sending troops over the border. Unrest began with protests in the country's capital, Kiev, last year after pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych, favoring closer ties to Russia, dropped plans to sign a political and economic agreement with the European Union. After months of protests and days of deadly clashes between demonstrators and security personnel in Kiev, parliament ousted Yanukovych in February. Weeks later, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula. In April, violence broke out in two Ukrainian regions that border Russia -- Donetsk and Luhansk -- as separatist leaders declared independence from Kiev. Since mid-April, the conflict between the pro-Russian rebels and the Ukrainian military has cost more than 2,500 lives, according to the United Nations.
