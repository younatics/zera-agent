"The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld a Michigan law banning the use of racial criteria in college admissions, a key decision in an unfolding legal and political battle nationally over affirmative action. The justices found 6-2 that a lower court did not have the authority to set aside the measure approved in a 2006 referendum supported by 58% of voters. It bars publicly funded colleges from granting ""preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin."" Justice Sonia Sotomayor reacted sharply in disagreeing with the decision. ""For members of historically marginalized groups, which rely on the federal courts to protect their constitutional rights, the decision can hardly bolster hope for a vision of democracy that preserves for all the right to participate meaningfully and equally in self-government,"" Sotomayor wrote. But three justices in the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts, Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito. concluded that the lower court did not have the authority to set aside the law. ""This case is not about how the debate about racial preferences should be resolved. It is about who may resolve it,"" Kennedy wrote. ""Michigan voters used the initiative system to bypass public officials who were deemed not responsive to the concerns of a majority of the voters with respect to a policy of granting race-based preferences that raises difficult and delicate issues,"" he added. Justices Antonin Scalia, Stephen Breyer and Clarence Thomas voted in the majority as part of concurring opinions. Sotomayor and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, and Justice Elena Kagan took no part in the case. The court's first Latina justice, Sotomayor, took the unusual step of reading part of her powerful dissent from the bench, taking more than 15 minutes to express her concern about the ruling's impact. ""This refusal to accept the stark reality that race matters is regrettable. The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race, and to apply the Constitution with eyes open to the unfortunate effects of centuries of racial discrimination,"" she said. ""As members of the judiciary tasked with intervening to carry out the guarantee of equal protection, we ought not sit back and wish away, rather than confront, the racial inequality that exists in our society,"" she added. The latest step . The decision was the latest step in a legal and political battle over whether state colleges can use race and gender as a factor in choosing what students to admit. The debate in recent years has centered around whether and when affirmative action programs -- while constitutionally permissible now -- would eventually have to be phased out as the goal of obtaining diversity is met. Last year, the court affirmed the use of race at the University of Texas, but made it harder for institutions to justify such policies to achieve diversity. In that dispute, a white student said the college's existing affirmative action policy violated her ""equal protection"" rights. Civil rights supporters of such programs claim Michigan's ban also has the same effect, and a federal appeals court agreed. The Supreme Court ruled in 2003 that while state universities could use race as a factor in choosing which students to admit, they could not make race the determining factor in deciding whether applicants are accepted. Michigan has said minority enrollment at its flagship university, the University of Michigan, has not gone down since the measure was passed. Civil rights groups dispute those figures and say other states have seen fewer African-American and Hispanic students attending highly competitive schools, especially in graduate level fields like law, medicine, and science. ""Students deserve a robust education where a variety of viewpoints are shared and debated,"" said Professor Kevin Gaines of the University of Michigan, one of the original plaintiffs. ""Proposal 2 has meant less diversity in our universities, which has had a chilling effect on the quality of discourse in the classroom. Unfortunately, that will continue, at least for the time being, in Michigan."" But supporters of Michigan's policies applauded the high court's conclusions. ""The court emphasized the value of allowing hotly contested policy decisions to be debated in the states rather than encouraging one-size-fits-all orders from Washington,"" said Carrie Severino, chief counsel for Judicial Crisis Network. ""In preserving for the states and the people the right to pursue race-neutral policies with respect to hiring and higher education, the court reaffirmed the blessings of liberty and equality under law for another generation,"" Severino said. Controversial efforts . The Michigan ban also prohibits the state from considering race and gender in public hiring and public contracting decisions. But the current high court case dealt only with the college admissions portion. Efforts over decades to create a diverse classroom have been controversial. The Brown vs. Board of Education high court ruling in 1954 ended segregation of public schools, but sparked nationwide protests and disobedience by states that initially refused to integrate. In the 1978 Bakke case, the justices ruled universities have a compelling state interest in promoting diversity, and that allows for the use of affirmative action. That issue involved a discrimination claim by a white man denied admission to medical  school. The referendum issue has been around at least since 1996, when California voters endorsed Proposition 209, which bans use of race, sex, or ethnic background by state agencies in areas of education, and government hiring and contracts. Six other states now have similar laws, and others may follow suit. ""With today's opinion, the court has placed responsibility for affirmative action squarely in the hands of the states. State universities can choose to adopt affirmative action admissions programs, and state voters can choose to discontinue them,"" said Jennifer Mason McAward, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame. ""The fact that this relatively simple judgment generated five separate opinions by the justices, however, points to a much more nuanced and heated debate among the justices regarding the permissibility and wisdom of racial preferences in general,"" McAward said. Roberts has made the issue a key part of the court's docket in recent years and it could serve as a major legacy of the current conservative majority. The case is Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action (12-682). I was an affirmative action 'imposter'","Key argument in opinion concludes that lower court didn't have authority to set aside Michigan law .

The debate centers on whether affirmative action programs would be phased out in the future .

"(CNN) -- Not long ago, I was in Pennsylvania coal country speaking with college students about the power of entrepreneurship and how everyone needs to take some risk these days or risk being left behind. During the Q&A, a hand shot up. ""I'm wondering how what you're saying applies to me,"" a young man said. ""I don't have a big idea. I don't have connections. And I don't live in Silicon Valley."" I said the first thing that came to mind. ""Don't worry. You don't need a hoodie to be an entrepreneur!"" Afterward, I was haunted by his question -- and disappointed by my glib response. When I first started helping entrepreneurs in the 1990s, the word ""entrepreneur"" was not popular. It was a rarefied word that applied only to founders of the fastest-growing (or fastest-failing) enterprises. And at the risk of pointing out the obvious, those leaders were mostly young, male and in tech. Today entrepreneurship doesn't just mean starting a tech company, as valuable as that may be. It means undertaking any bold venture -- from selling crafts out of your basement to improving your neighborhood to proposing a new initiative in your corporation. The techniques involved in sharpening your idea, facing down critics, recruiting boosters and handling setbacks apply in almost every realm of work. Entrepreneurship, defined as a nimble, creatively destructive, optimistic force, has become the go-to problem-solving technique of the 21st century. But that's also created a problem. The word ""entrepreneur,"" once underused, is now overused. We have ""social entrepreneurs,"" ""intrapreneurs,"" ""mompreneurs,"" ""kidpreneurs."" What we need is a new lexicon. In my book, ""Crazy Is a Compliment,"" I propose four categories, or species. 1. Gazelles . These are classic entrepreneurs -- those who start new businesses and aim to become hot phenomena. Think of Google, GoPro or Spanx. ""Gazelle"" was a term that economist David Birch came up with in 1994. It describes high-growth businesses whose sales double every four years. Though just 6% of companies fit this model, this miniscule group accounts for nearly all private sector job creation. Like the animal, gazelle entrepreneurs are fast-moving and high-jumping. 2. Skunks . The term ""intrapreneur,"" coined in the 1970s, refers to innovators within large corporations. Though the word remains clunky, the idea of encouraging employees to be more independent and creative has become an urgent cry. The ""topple rate"" of big companies, a metric that gauges how often they lose their leadership position, more than doubled between 1965 and 2008. Pretending your job is safe and your company is stable leaves you dangerously exposed. If you think risk-taking is risky, being risk-averse is often riskier. Even if your company continues to thrive, your ability to survive in it depends on your capacity and willingness to innovate. Job security these days depends on the same qualities that make good entrepreneurs -- agility, imagination, persistence and execution. As Michael Dell told me, ""There are the quick, and the dead."" Adapt from within or be forced to adapt from without. Become a skunk. I've adopted this term from Lockheed Corporation, which during World War II set up a secret division to build fighter jets. It was called Skunk Works. The message: entrepreneurs operating within large corporations go out of their way to stink up the joint. 3. Dolphins . For the past decade, there's been abundant chatter that the social sector must become more entrepreneurial. Nonprofits need to employ more business techniques. Philanthropy needs more metrics. Despite this, too many organizations continue to lag behind the age of disruption. What they need are more dolphins. Dolphins are contrarians in the nonprofit or public sector who are willing to buck convention and agitate for change. Why dolphins? Because they're smart, social and among the few altruistic animals. But they're not pushovers: harm a dolphin's pod and watch out! Today, even causes for which there are no compelling private-sector solutions are ripe for entrepreneurial shake-up. Dolphins are the ones making the waves. 4. Butterflies . The last group that needs to be more entrepreneurial are small-scale or lifestyle entrepreneurs -- plumbers, yoga instructors, bakers, craft makers. 40% of American adults have now spent part of their careers working on their own. As Jay-Z put it, ""I'm not a businessman; I'm a business, man."" I call this species butterflies, because butterflies are varied (there are at least 17,500 types) and driven by freedom and individualism. At first glance, this group would hardly seem candidates for the skillset of ground-breaking change-makers. Do you really need to be disruptive when you're selling homemade cheese at the farmer's market? The answer: You do, because your competitor probably has an in at Whole Foods, accepts credit-card payments with a Square reader and just launched a vibrant web business. Etsy, the online arts and crafts hub, now has over a million ""makers"" selling goods directly to consumers. Even butterflies need to spread their wings wider. Today, nearly two decades after I first started mentoring entrepreneurs, innovators of all types are popping up everywhere. They aren't waiting for changes to happen to them, they're making changes happen every day. Whatever your passion, pick one of these species and start writing your story -- or risk being an ostrich, with your head stuck in the sand.","Linda Rottenberg: Back in the 1990s, the word ""entrepreneur"" was not popular .
Rottenberg: Entrepreneurship today means starting a firm or taking on any bold venture .
She says with the term being overused, there are four ways to differentiate entrepreneurs .
Rottenberg: Are you a Gazelle, Skunk, Dolphin or Butterfly?"
"(CNN) -- The question of whether or not Jesus had a wife is back again. This week two authors came out with a book about a newly translated ancient text -- a ""Lost Gospel,"" as the book calls it. The text has been in the possession of the British Library since 1847 but only in recent years attracted scholars' attention. It suggests that Jesus was not only married but had two children, and that Mary Magdalene -- long viewed as a close friend of Jesus -- was indeed the Virgin Mary. It also suggests that there had been an assassination attempt on the children of Jesus and Mary more than a decade before the Crucifixion, when Jesus was 20. Could it all be true? This may sound vaguely reminiscent of ""The Da Vinci Code,"" which Dan Brown published in 2003, but in truth questions about the relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene have been around for a long time, and the ""Lost Gospel"" only adds to the legend. As to its validity, scholars will be weighing in heavily, like they did when a fragment of another lost gospel was revealed by Karen L. King, a professor at Harvard, almost two years ago. That scrap of papyrus was not a forgery, as many at the time believed. Carbon dating recently confirmed its origin in eighth century Egypt, although it's a more recent text than King originally thought. These new claims about a possible ""fifth gospel"" are made by professor Barrie Wilson of York University in Canada and Simca Jacobovic, an Israeli-Canadian writer and filmmaker. Their painstaking work on this text, called ""The Ecclesiastical History of Zacharias Rhetor,"" was written on animal skin in Syriac, a dialect of Aramaic, the language that Jesus spoke. There is, in fact, a lot of literature in Syriac, which became an important literary language in the Middle East, especially after the fourth century. The new ""gospel"" was apparently bought from an Egyptian monastery in the mid-19th-century and brought to England, though its exact origins remain obscure. ""Scholars scrutinized the document and discarded it as insignificant,"" writes Terrence McCoy in the Washington Post. It won't be the first ""lost gospel."" The idea that Jesus may have been married to Mary Magdalene was popularized by the wonderful Greek novelist Nikos Kazantzakis in ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" in 1953. Martin Scorsese made a movie out of it in 1988. Dan Brown only jumped on an already moving bandwagon with ""The Da Vinci Code."" The text described in this newest ""Lost Gospel"" is said to be a translation from an original Greek manuscript, according to a letter dating to the sixth century that accompanied the Syriac text in the British Library, says a Daily Mail article on the book. No matter how you look at this narrative, it is ancient in origin and may indeed reach back to the first century, when the four canonical gospels -- Matthew, Mark, Luke and John -- were written, although this is Wilson and Jacobovici's conjecture. The Syriac story isn't even directly about Jesus. It's written in code, centering on a man called Joseph, a kind of Jesus substitute. His wife is called Aseneth and is said to stand in for Mary Magdalene. In this tale, Joseph is called the ""son of God,"" and there are passages that seem to parallel the language of Holy Communion. Joseph and Aseneth are married by the Egyptian pharaoh, who pronounces at their wedding: ""Blessed are you by the Lord God of Joseph, because he is the first-born of God, and you will be called the Daughter of God Most High and the bride of Joseph now and for ever."" It's worth recalling that many gospels were composed in the decades, even centuries, after Jesus -- not only the four that Christians acknowledge. These include the well-known gospels of Thomas, Peter, Judas and James. The so-called Gnostic gospels, which came to light in 1945 in the Egyptian desert at Nag Hammadi, contain numerous writings from early Christianity, including a complete gospel of Thomas and partial versions of gospels of Philip and Mary, among others. It was not until the end of the second century that Irenaeus, the influential Bishop of Lyon, did his level best to make sure that only Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were regarded as the four pillars of Christianity. He wanted to stamp out numerous texts with competing claims for scriptural authority. So what should Christians believe when new material about Jesus appears? Could there be other gospels that tell us more than we can learn from Matthew, Mark, Luke and John? Could Jesus, for instance, have had a wife and children? What role did Mary Magdalene play in his life? It's obvious that Mary Magdalene was close to Jesus. She called him ""rabboni,"" in Aramaic, meaning teacher. Others did, too. She was there at the foot of the cross and was the first to visit the tomb after his death. Would anyone but a wife have come to see the body of a recently crucified man? This seems like an intimate act. And Jesus revealed himself to her when he rose from the dead before anyone else. In the first century, it would have been typical of a rabbi to have a wife. And we know that Peter, a close disciple of Jesus, had a wife, as Jesus went to visit Peter's sick mother-in-law. As it were, we hear nothing about the actual wife of Peter or the possible wives of other disciples. The accepted -- or canonical -- gospels don't say that Jesus had a wife. If he did, they would probably have mentioned such an important piece of biographical data. But it's useful to remember that the gospel tradition is rich and varied, full of fascinating material that isn't necessarily canonical. And we can't know exactly what is and what isn't authentic among the voluminous early writings about Jesus. Myself, I doubt this Syriac text is more than a fantasy, an early version of ""The Da Vinci Code."" Jesus stories were abundant after his death, forcing his followers to pick and choose among many texts that might have spiritual value. The Christian church made its selection, pushing into the margins those gospel writings and ancillary religious texts deemed heretical. Interest in these materials should surprise nobody, though one should always take the claims of these texts, and those who promote them, with a grain of salt.","Jay Parini: New book based on ancient texts appears to show Jesus married with 2 kids .

"The Nobel Peace Prize has turned the global spotlight back on the conflict in Syria. The prize committee in Oslo, Norway, awarded it Friday to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the international chemical weapons watchdog helping to eliminate the Syrian army's stockpiles of poison gas. EXCLUSIVE: Inside lab that tested Syria chemical weapon evidence . Its inspectors have just begun working in the active war zone, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee said it hopes the award offers ""strong support"" to them as they face arduous and life-threatening tasks. But the OPCW did not receive the prize primarily because of its work in Syria, committee chairman Thorbjorn Jagland said. ""It is because of its long-standing efforts to eliminate chemical weapons and that we are now about to reach the goal and do away with a whole category of weapons of mass destruction. That would be a great event in history, if we can achieve that."" Nevertheless, OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu said he wants the prize to inspire everyone to reach for peace in Syria. ""I truly hope that this award ... will help broader efforts to achieve peace in that country and (ease) the suffering of its people,"" Uzumcu said told reporters Friday afternoon. Uzumcu, saying he was ""pleasantly surprised"" by the award and acknowledging it was a great honor, added that ""events in Syria have been a tragic reminder that there remains much work yet to be done."" ""The recognition that the peace prize brings will spur us to untiring effort, even stronger commitment and greater dedication,"" he said. U.S. President Barack Obama congratulated the group. A White House statement said ""this award honors those who make it their life's work to advance this vital goal."" ""Today's award recognizes that commitment, and reinforces the trust and confidence the world has placed in the OPCW, Director-General Ahmed Uzumcu, and the courageous OPCW experts and inspectors taking on the unprecedented challenge of eliminating Syria's chemical weapons program,"" the statement said. Chemical weapons team faces many dangers . Team in Syria . A team from the OPCW and the United Nations has been in Syria since October 1, and it oversaw the first destruction of chemical weapons equipment this week. On Sunday, Syrian personnel used ""cutting torches and angle grinders to destroy or disable a range of items,"" the OPCW said. ""This included missile warheads, aerial bombs and mixing and filling equipment."" U.N.: Destruction of Syria's chemical weapons begins . Given the danger the inspectors face, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon this week described the joint OPCW-U.N. mission in Syria as ""an operation the likes of which, quite simply, have never been tried before."" The joint mission is tasked by a U.N. Security Council resolution with eliminating all chemical weapons in the country by midyear 2014. Nobel recognizes risks faced by weapons inspectors . Ban has set out the three phases of the mission: establishing an initial presence and verifying the Syrian government's declaration of its stockpiles; overseeing the destruction of chemical weapons; and verification of the destruction of any and all chemical weapons-related programs or materials. The team is in Syria is made up of 35 members, but the OPCW is preparing to deploy a second team to strengthen the effort. The group plans to grow the team to 100. Where are Syria's chemical weapons? The government in Damascus has been cooperative so far, and there is hope they will reach their goal. ""These developments present a constructive beginning for what will nonetheless be a long and difficult process,"" Uzumcu said. On August 21, a chemical attack outside Damascus led the United States and its allies to call for military intervention in Syria's civil war -- a confrontation that was defused in mid-September, when Damascus agreed to a U.S.-Russian plan to give up its chemical weapons stockpile. The United States estimates the Syrian arsenal at about 1,000 tons of blister agents and nerve gas. The Syrians provided an initial declaration of its stockpile and must submit a plan for destroying the weapons by October 27, Uzumcu said. Nobel justification . The award to the OPCW was intended in part as a message to countries still harboring chemical weapons to get rid of them, Jagland said. In awarding the prize, the Norwegian committee highlighted the widespread use of chemical weapons in World War I and efforts to stop it since. In 1925, the Geneva Convention prohibited their use. But during World War II, the Nazi dictatorship under Adolf Hitler employed them to extinguish the lives of millions of concentration camp inmates in the Holocaust. Chemical weapons: The desperate commander's escape from stalemate . The Geneva Convention left some loopholes open, though, the Norwegian committee said.  It does not prohibit the production and storage of chemical weapons. But in 1997, an international convention banning that as well was instituted. About the OPCW . The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, based in The Hague, in the Netherlands, is the independent implementing body for the Chemical Weapons Convention, an international arms control treaty. The Chemical Weapons Convention entered into force in April 1997, at which point 87 states had ratified it, and the work of the OPCW to implement its provisions began at that point. Syria: Are chemical weapons worse than conventional attacks? According to the treaty's wording, signatories are ""determined for the sake of all mankind, to exclude completely the possibility of the use of chemical weapons, through the implementation of the provisions of this Convention."" Sixteen years later, more than 100 additional states have ratified the treaty. In September, Syria became the latest nation to ask to join the convention. It is due to enter into force in Syria on October 14, when it will become the 190th member state. Peace prize . In the lead-up to the prize announcement Friday, the global media speculated that an individual would win, possibly Congolese physician Denis Mukwege, who treats victims of gang rape, or Malala Yousafzai, the teenage education activist from Pakistan whom a Taliban assassin shot for her work to promote education for girls. Malala appeared to be the front-runner in headlines around the world. CNN's Monita Rajpal asked Jagland why she did not win. ""Fortunately, we have many good candidates every year, actually this year, more than 250. And the woman you mentioned, Malala, is an outstanding woman, but we never comment on why she or others didn't get the prize,"" he said. ""The right answer is that she didn't get the prize because OPCW got it. She and others will probably be candidates in the years to come."" A Twitter account in Malala's name sent out a message congratulating the OPCW and thanking it for its work. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, which is to air at 7 p.m. Sunday, Malala said it might be premature for her to receive the Nobel Peace Prize this early in her life. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon congratulated the OPCW, saying it has ""greatly strengthened the rule of law in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation."" ""From the battlefields to the laboratories to the negotiating table, the United Nations is honored to work hand-in-hand with the OPCW to eliminate the threat posed by chemical weapons for all people and for all time,"" Ban said Friday. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also voiced congratulations. He highlighted the organization's role in Syria. ""The Nobel Committee has rightly recognized their bravery and resolve to carry out this vital mission amid an ongoing war in Syria,"" he said. Last year, the Norwegian committee awarded the peace prize to the European Union as it grappled with the worst crisis since its founding -- devastating debt and the threat of disintegration. The award was a salute to the struggling 27-nation union for its work in promoting democracy and reconciliation since World War II. It is common for the Nobel Peace Prize to go to organizations. Opinion: Why Europe deserved the Peace Prize . Other large organizations that have won it include the United Nations, Doctors Without Borders, U.N. peacekeeping forces, the U.N. atomic energy agency, the Red Cross and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. The Peace Prize is the fifth Nobel Prize to be awarded this week, preceded by honors in medicine, physics, chemistry and literature. The final Nobel Prize, recognizing achievement in the field of economics, will be awarded Monday.","Nobel committee hopes the award gives ""strong support"" to OPCW inspectors in Syria .

"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has unveiled an iPhone app called Operation Predator that asks the public for help in gathering information on suspected child sexual predators, including those who are fugitives. The new app, created in conjunction with Homeland Security Investigations' Cyber Crime Center, lets users submit a tip by phone or by filling out a tip form in the app. All tips can be submitted anonymously. People with information about suspects can also submit tips online or by calling (866) 347-2423. The app includes photos of fugitives and asks for help in trying to find suspected child predators for criminal prosecution. Under the alerts section there are images and names of people who are wanted for crimes such as possession of child pornography. Unidentified suspects are listed as ""John Doe"" and the public is asked to help identify them from available photos. There also is an option to share these profiles on Twitter or Facebook to help spread the word. Free speech activists oppose Iceland's proposed online pornography ban . An urgent case currently tops the app's feed. A ""John Doe"" is wanted for producing child pornography that involved the sexual abuse of a girl between 10 and 12 years old.

"On Earth, the United States may be trading bitter accusations with Russia over Ukraine. But in space, it's a different story. The space collaboration between the two nations has survived other diplomatic kerfuffles. And there's no need to worry, NASA says. ""We do not expect the current Russia-Ukraine situation to have any impact on our civil space cooperation with Russia, including our partnership on the International Space Station program,"" said Allard Beutel, a NASA spokesman. ""It is in the best interest of all ISS partners not to allow disruption of operations that have maintained continuous human presence on orbit for over a decade."" Right now, U.S. astronaut Mike Hopkins is aboard the Space Station with two Russian cosmonauts. He returns home aboard a Russian capsule on Monday. A few weeks later, another American astronaut, Steven Swanson, joins another two Russians on a trip to the station aboard another Russian Soyuz craft. Putin vs. Obama: Facing off over facts in Ukraine . 'Reluctant co-dependency' The two nations can't afford temporary tussles to upend a costly relationship -- one that James Oberg, a former space engineer, describes as ""reluctant co-dependency."" NASA retired its space shuttle fleet in 2011, and its astronauts have no way to get to and from the station. Russian Soyuz capsules ferry U.S. astronauts and cosmonauts, together with supplies that can fit in the smaller craft. In turn, the United States brings to the table technology far more advanced than Russia's capabilities, Oberg told Politico. At the same time, many of the Russian systems are more reliable because they are simpler and have been operating longer, Leroy Chiao, former NASA astronaut and International Space Station commander, told CNN. The space station itself has an intricate blend of both countries' contributions -- from U.S. solar arrays and power systems to Russian core life support systems, to a navigation system that comes from both countries, he said. Americans and Russians train on each other's systems, but one country can't run the station alone, he said. The mission control centers in Houston and Korolyov, near Moscow, have to coordinate commands sent to the station, he said. ""We need each other to operate the station,"" Chiao said. ""Otherwise we run the risk of losing that asset."" Past disagreements . Russia and the United States have disagreed on various issues in the past --  including most recently, the war in Syria, and Moscow's granting of temporary asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden. The extraterrestrial partnership has gone unscathed. ""NASA and its Russian counterpart, Roscosmos, have maintained a professional, beneficial and collegial working relationship through the various ups and downs of the broader U.S.-Russia relationship and we expect that to continue,"" Beutel said. Going about their days . Up in space, the crew members for International Space Station Expedition 38 are going about their regular days. When they're not busy conducting experiments, they play with floating food, exercise and document the spinning Earth with scenic pictures of various continents. ""Checked out our Sokul suits today in preparation for returning to Earth next Monday,"" Hopkins tweeted this week. ""Can't believe it's almost time!"" Hopkins' crew includes Russians Sergey Ryazanskiy and  Oleg Kotov, the latter a native of Crimea. The trio's research focuses on human health and documenting protein crystal growth, which will help researchers come up with new treatment for diseases such as cystic fibrosis. The three launched in September, and are also studying the effects of extended space travel as NASA and Roscosmos prepare to send  two crew members aboard the space station for a year. But it's not all work and no play at the working laboratory orbiting about 240 miles above Earth. The crew also gets a chance to gaze at breathtaking sunsets and sunrises that occur every 45 minutes. On their regular weekends off, the  international scientists watch movies, play music and cards, and talk to their families. A pretty penny . The agreement between the two nations costs a pretty penny. According to a new deal NASA signed with the Russian space agency, the United States will pay Russia $71 million to ferry each astronaut to the space station. The emergence of private companies into the space transport business may change the game. NASA has a $1.6 billion contract with SpaceX to fly at least 12 cargo resupply missions to the space station, and a $1.9 billion contract with Orbital Sciences for eight such missions. SpaceX is gearing up for its third commercial resupply mission this month; Orbital Sciences completed its first in February. As for transporting astronauts, NASA said in November that it is seeking to partner with U.S. companies for human trips to the station as well, by 2017. That could end U.S. reliance on Russia for space voyages. But for now, experts say the U.S.-Russia relationship on space remains a marriage of convenience.","Former astronaut says both countries necessary for ISS .

"What would you do if you only had one day to live? Probably not spend time downloading and fiddling with a mobile app, we're guessing. But a new app, Sobrr, wants you to embrace life in just that way. It lets you create a social network geared toward meeting new people around you, sharing photos and videos of what you're up to and supporting other users who are also living it up. Or whatever. Using GPS, Sobrr identifies other users close to you and shows them your posts. They may then ""cheer"" or comment on those posts and, if both parties agree, they can become ""24-hour friends."" There's an option for users who hit it off to make each other permanent parts of their network. The kicker is that, anything you do using the app is totally erased after 24 hours. Texts you send to other users disappear after a few seconds and photos or videos you share can go away nearly as quickly. The app's co-founder, Bruce Yang, says that in an era when your third-grade teacher can find you on Facebook and anyone you've ever met at work wants to network on LinkedIn, people are craving an app like Sobrr. It lets them share without worrying their actions will go down on their permanent record. ""It promotes sharing only the most refreshing contents and leading a casual relationship with no strings attached,"" said Yang, an alum of Fitbit, LinkedIn and Microsoft. So, you can call Sobrr the anti-Facebook. But if you want to call it Tinder meets Snapchat meets Foursquare, you wouldn't be that far-off either. The app's name reflects the moment the idea first dawned on Yang -- the morning after a Las Vegas bachelor party. He says he noticed all of his fellow partyers rushing onto their social media accounts to make sure they hadn't shared any incriminating info about the previous night. No, Yang says, his app isn't just another tool for the hookup culture or a way to send naughty photos without having to answer for them later. But if somebody wants to use it that way? He's not here to stop them. ""From the party animals that I've surveyed, more than half admitted that they want to meet new people in the party, and crave for a one-night stand,"" he said. Sobrr lets users post content ""that they might otherwise feel too embarrassed to post on other platforms,"" he said. Yang also said it's important for users  ""to have their own space and little secrets."" But he maintains that ""naughty stuff"" is only a small part of what users have been sharing in the month since the app's release. ""We understand that 'hooking up' is the need of many users on the platform, but we really value more of the casual interaction and conversation on the platform -- the foreplay of hooking up,"" he said. ""People are more attracted by each other based on their life moments or a common interest."" It's possible the Silicon Valley startup is onto something. In the past year or so, ephemeral messaging apps such as Snapchat, Confide and Wickr have flourished. So far, the app's user base remains relatively small, boasting 10,000 users in the weeks it's been available exclusively for Apple's mobile devices. Whether more folks will flock to it to live a more carefree social media life, or merely hide the evidence from their wild nights out, remains to be seen.","Sobrr is a 24-hour social-networking app on which posts disappear after one day .

"Could a wooden marionette help solve Detroit's budgetary woes? With Detroit's declaration on Thursday of bankruptcy, some of the city's creditors may think so. The museum of the Detroit Institute of Arts, home to 60,000 pieces of art, is also home to the original Howdy Doody marionette puppet that was the star of its own 1950s-era children's show. It was acquired in 2001, according to the DIA's director of communications. ""It is estimated that the marionette could sell at auction for $400,000 to $500,000,"" said Gary Busk, a puppet collector who was featured on the television program ""Antiques Road Show."" That would hardly make a dent in the city's immense $18 billion debt. But, despite an opinion from the state's attorney general that appeared to assure Howdy would stay, legal experts say there's still a risk he could wind up packing his bags and riding into the sunset with many of the museum's other residents. The arts institute's director, Graham Beal, maintains that DIA's collection is among the top six in the Western Hemisphere. While he could not specify a value, Beal told CNN in May that it would likely be in the billions of dollars. It was then that that a request by Detroit's emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, for an inventory of holdings sparked alarm among Detroit residents and museum administrators that the DIA's collection could be sold to help pay off the city's debt. Then, in June, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette issued an opinion stating that Detroit can't sell the DIA's art, although the city technically owns the collection. ""It is my opinion, therefore, that the art collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts is held by the City of Detroit in charitable trust for the people of Michigan, and no piece in the collection may thus be sold, conveyed, or transferred to satisfy city debts or obligations,"" Schuette told CNN in a written statement. He said that he recognized the extreme financial hardships the city is experiencing, and the challenges the city faces, but argued that selling the artwork would ""damage not only the city's but the state's cultural commonwealth."" But the opinion could be for naught, said Eric Scorsone of Michigan State University prior to Thursday's declaration. ""It's certainly better than nothing, but a state attorney general's opinion is certainly not going to be definitive in federal bankruptcy court,"" Scorsone said. ""I don't think that is going to carry a huge amount of weight."" Laura Martell, a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, echoed that sentiment. ""He just issued an opinion, which is not binding on anyone and certainly has no legal effect in a bankruptcy case,"" she said. ""A bankruptcy judge may or may not find it persuasive on the merits of its analysis, but it has no binding effect."" Bill Nowling, spokesman for emergency manager Orr, said that ""nothing is being considered for sale."" ""All of the city's creditors have asked about the DIA and whether it has been valued -- it has not -- and some creditors have said everything that isn't nailed down should be sold to pay them,"" Nowling wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""That won't happen because the emergency manager's proposed restructuring plan is focused on restoring essential city services."" However, Detroit's creditors say promises were made and debts must be paid. ""If they're talking about not being solvent when they have these assets, they do still have some degree of solvency by selling these assets,"" said Peter Hayes, a managing director at BlackRock Inc., an investment management corporation whose investors are owed approximately $200 million by the city of Detroit. Even as signs of the coming bankruptcy grew stronger, the DIA's officials remained resolute in their determination to protect their collection. ""Our position hasn't changed. We only sell works of art to buy works of art,"" Beal said. ""We are not given works of art so that we can settle debts made (during) decades of mismanagement and corruption."" Howdy Doody is a marionette in the image of a freckled-face boy dressed in cowboy attire. ""The Howdy Doody Show"" ran on NBC from 1947 to 1960. One of Muppet creator Jim Henson's Kermit the Frog puppets is also among the DIA's puppet collection, which boasts around 800 pieces. The DIA was founded in 1885 and houses more than 100 galleries, a lecture and recital hall, an art reference library, and a state-of-the-art conservation laboratory, according to the museum's website.","Despite an opinion from Michigan's attorney general, Howdy Doody may be moving .

"As Ukraine's new leaders accused Russia of declaring war, Russia's Prime Minister warned Sunday that blood could be spilled amid growing instability in the neighboring nation. Kiev mobilized troops and called up military reservists in a rapidly escalating crisis that has raised fears of a conflict. And world leaders pushed for a diplomatic solution. In a post on his official Facebook page, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev called the recent ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych a ""seizure of power."" ""Such a state of order will be extremely unstable,"" Medvedev said. ""It will end with the new revolution. With new blood."" Officials said signs of Russian military intervention in Ukraine's Crimean peninsula were clear. Russian generals led their troops to three bases in the region Sunday, demanding Ukrainian forces surrender and hand over their weapons, Vladislav Seleznyov, spokesman for the Crimean Media Center of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, told CNN. By late Sunday, Russian forces had ""complete operational control of the Crimean Peninsula,"" a senior U.S. administration official said. The United States estimates there are 6,000 Russian ground and naval forces in the region, the official said. ""There is no question that they are in an occupation position -- flying in reinforcements and settling in,"" another senior administration official said. Speaking by phone, Seleznyov said Russian troops had blocked access to bases but added, ""There is no open confrontation between Russian and Ukrainian military forces in Crimea"" and said Ukrainian troops continue to protect and serve Ukraine. ""This is a red alert. This is not a threat. This is actually a declaration of war to my country,"" Ukrainian interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said. Speaking in a televised address from the parliament building in the capital, Kiev, he called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to ""pull back his military and stick to the international obligations."" ""We are on the brink of the disaster."" A strange scene, somewhat polite standoff in Crimea . Kerry heading to Kiev . A sense of escalating crisis in Crimea -- an autonomous region of eastern Ukraine with strong loyalty to neighboring Russia -- swirled, with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry condemning what he called Russia's ""incredible act of aggression."" Speaking on the CBS program ""Face The Nation,"" Kerry -- who is set to arrive in Kiev on Tuesday -- said several foreign powers are looking at economic consequences if Russia does not withdraw its forces. ""All of them, every single one of them are prepared to go to the hilt in order to isolate Russia with respect to this invasion,"" he said. ""They're prepared to put sanctions in place, they're prepared to isolate Russia economically."" Kerry rebukes Russia's 'incredible act of aggression' But Ukraine's ambassador to the United Nations said his country needs more than diplomatic assistance. ""We are to demonstrate that we have our own capacity to protect ourselves ... and we are preparing to defend ourselves,"" Yuriy Sergeyev said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""And nationally, if aggravation is going in that way, when the Russian troops ... are enlarging their quantity with every coming hour ... we will ask for military support and other kinds of support."" Pushing diplomatic possibilities . In Brussels, Belgium, NATO ambassadors held an emergency meeting on Ukraine. ""What Russia is doing now in Ukraine violates the principles of the U.N. charter,"" NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters. He later added that Russia's actions constituted a violation of international law. He called upon Russia to honor its international commitments, to send it military forces back to Russian bases, and to refrain from any further interference in Ukraine. Rasmussen also urged both sides to reach a peaceful resolution through diplomatic talks and suggested that international observers from the United Nations should be sent to Ukraine. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's office said Putin had accepted a proposal to establish a ""fact-finding mission"" to Ukraine, possibly under the leadership of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and to start a political dialogue. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon dispatched a special envoy to Ukraine Sunday evening, a spokesman for his office said. Lean to the West, or to Russia? Ukraine, a nation of 45 million people sandwiched between Europe and Russia's southwestern border, has been plunged into chaos since the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych on February 22 following bloody street protests that left dozens dead and hundreds wounded. Anti-government protests started in late November when Yanukovych spurned a deal with the EU, favoring closer ties with Moscow instead. Ukraine has faced a deepening split, with those in the west generally supporting the interim government and its European Union tilt, while many in the east prefer a Ukraine where Russia casts a long shadow. Nowhere is that feeling more intense than in Crimea, the last big bastion of opposition to the new political leadership. Ukraine suspects Russia of fomenting tension in the autonomous region that might escalate into a bid for separation by its Russian majority. Ukrainian leaders and commentators have compared events in Crimea to what happened in Georgia in 2008. Then, cross-border tensions with Russia exploded into a five-day conflict that saw Russian tanks and troops pour into the breakaway territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, as well as Georgian cities. Russia and Georgia each blamed the other for starting the conflict. By Sunday night, electricity had been cut off at the headquarters of the Ukrainian Navy in Crimea, and officials feared there could soon be an attack, Seleznyov said. CNN has not independently verified that claim, and Russian officials could not be immediately reached to respond. Military maneuvering . Word of the power outage came hours after the newly named head of Ukraine's navy disavowed Ukraine's new leaders and declared his loyalty to the pro-Russian, autonomous Crimea government. Rear Adm. Denis Berezovsky, who was appointed Saturday by interim Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov, said from Sevastopol on the Black Sea that he will not submit to any orders from Kiev. He was quickly suspended and replaced by another rear admiral, the Defense Ministry in Kiev said in a written statement. These scenes come one day after Putin obtained permission from his parliament to use military force to protect Russian citizens in Ukraine, spurning Western pleas not to intervene. Putin cited in his request a threat posed to Russian citizens and military personnel based in southern Crimea. Ukrainian officials have vehemently denied Putin's claim. Western governments worried . The crisis set off alarm bells in the West and fueled a stern rebuke from the leaders of the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. In a statement Sunday, they condemned Russia's ""clear violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" saying they were temporarily suspending activities related to preparation for June's G8 Summit in Sochi, Russia. Canada recalled its ambassador to Moscow. Senior Obama administration officials Sunday portrayed Russia's intervention in Ukraine as weak, describing it in a conference call with reporters as a kind of desperate measure from a man who realizes he has lost support of the international community. When asked what concrete measures the administration has taken to signal its strong opposition to Russian involvement in Ukraine, the officials noted that planning meetings about the upcoming G8 summit in Sochi had been canceled. In the long term, economic sanctions could be employed, they said. The officials declined to be more specific about what those sanctions might involve. In discussions over the weekend with Putin, Obama ""made clear that Russia's continued violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity would negatively impact Russia's standing in the international community,"" according to a statement released by the White House. During that call, one administration official said, Putin did not ""slam the door"" to the idea that international monitors could travel to Ukraine to make sure violence doesn't flare up, one official said. According to the Kremlin, Putin told Obama that Russia reserves the right to defend its interests in the Crimea region and the Russian-speaking people who live there. Obama met Sunday with his national security team and called U.S. allies afterward, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. British Prime Minister David Cameron said he and Obama were of the same mind when they spoke on Sunday. ""We agreed Russia's actions are unacceptable and there must be significant costs if they don't change course,"" Cameron posted on his verified Twitter account. Cameron also planned to talk with Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Britain's Foreign Minister William Hague arrived Sunday in Kiev, where he will meet with Ukraine leaders.","Russian forces have ""complete operational control"" of Crimea, a U.S. official says .

"Don't call it a comeback, it's been here for years -- millions of years. A sea animal called Protulophila was thought to have been extinct for 4 million years, but has been found living in New Zealand waters. Never heard of Protulophila? It is a tiny animal related to corals and sea anemones, that forms tiny holes on the tubes of marine worms, according to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research. This creature was not known to have lived outside of Europe and the Middle East, but this year, a group of scientists found fossils of Protulophila in New Zealand. These fossils dated to a period when the creatures were thought to be extinct already. So the researchers re-examined some tubeworms that were collected in New Zealand in 2008, and discovered that they had overlooked the Protulophila that was living on them, NIWA said in a news release. Scientists refer to this finding as the discovery of a ""living fossil,"" referring to animals and plants that are so rare they are usually only seen as fossils. ""Finding living Protulophila is a rare example of how knowledge of fossils has led to the discovery of living biodiversity,"" NIWA marine biologist Dennis Gordon said.

"Kyle Nolan did his research -- his mother made sure of that.  She didn't want her 18-year-old son heading to the Amazon jungle at all -- let alone, without learning everything he could about the supposed ""medicine"" with the bizarre name that he insisted would help him turn his young life around. ""I really tried to discourage him ... I kept telling him over and over, there are no easy answers in life,"" Ingeborg Oswald said. But she knew she couldn't stop him. Overshadowed by his ""overachieving"" triplet brother and sister, Oswald said Kyle ""was going through this teenage crisis, not knowing what he wanted to do with his life."" He had dropped out of junior college and was living with his mother, when he somehow discovered ayahuasca, (pronounced ""eye-uh-WAHS-kuh"") a psychedelic brew that some believe can help users achieve a higher state of consciousness. ""He went online and started reading all these positive things about ayahuasca, which is something I had never heard of before,"" Oswald said.  ""Apparently there's a huge, positive movement toward ayahuasca. And he thought that that would help him maybe discover who he was."" His research led him to the Shimbre Shamanic Center in a remote corner of the Peruvian Amazon region. Oswald said the center's website made its ayahuasca experience ""sound very individualized."" It wasn't cheap: Kyle paid more than $2,000 in cash to take part in the ritual. Despite the promises of the center's website, a very different experience awaited Kyle Nolan in Peru. A death, then a cover-up . Kyle arrived in Peru in August 2012, a rare overseas excursion for a young man who was more of a homebody than a world traveler.  He journeyed deep into Peru's Amazon with hopes of experiencing a spiritual transformation. On the third night of Kyle's ayahuasca session, he never returned from his hut. Days later, when he didn't arrive home, Oswald called the Shimbre Shamanic Center and spoke to an interpreter for Shaman Mancoluto, who led the center's ayahuasca sessions. ""He told me, 'Oh well (Kyle) just decided he wanted to leave, he took off down the road, and he's left,'"" Oswald said. ""And I said, 'I don't believe you. My son would never ever do that.'"" So she and her daughter flew down to Peru to help local police search for Kyle. For three to four days, they searched hospitals and bars and talked to taxi drivers, asking if anyone had seen Kyle. ""No one ever saw him,"" Oswald said. So Oswald and her daughter returned home to northern California while the Peruvian police continued their investigation. About a week later, Oswald said she learned from her contact with the Shimbre center that the shaman admitted to police that he had lied about Kyle leaving the center. They had ""found him dead outside, under a bush,"" Oswald said. They ""panicked and covered him up, and told everyone that he wasn't feeling well, that he was in his cabin."" The shaman told authorities that he and two other men had buried Kyle's body, according to Oswald and Peruvian newspaper El Comercio. ""They said they put him in a wheelbarrow, took him about a mile down the road, dug a pit, buried him, and burned all his belongings,"" Oswald said. She returned to Peru where she had to identify her son's body. An autopsy in Peru was inconclusive. The shaman, whose real name is Jose Piñeda, and the two other men were arrested. Piñeda was eventually convicted of homicide and lying to authorities, and sentenced to five years in prison, according to local Peruvian media. Kyle's body was eventually brought back to California where Oswald said another autopsy also came up inconclusive, and he was cremated. According to El Comercio, the shaman told police that Kyle Nolan took too much ayahuasca. There's no conclusive evidence of what killed Kyle, Oswald said.  ""The only thing there is possibly out there is maybe the toxicology (results), but I can't get that unless I go back to Peru."" An unregulated drug . It's still unclear how ayahuasca can kill someone. Very little is known about ayahuasca and its effects and many shamanic centers, including the Shimbre Shamanic Center, require participants to cleanse their bodies for several months before taking ayahuasca -- a regiment that Oswald said her son followed very closely. Ethnobotanical organizations are trying to raise money to study ayahuasca and its medicinal qualities, as well as create a health guide for tourists interested in traveling to shamanic centers in the Amazon. There's a growing concern that as more Western tourists head to the Amazon looking for a psychedelic experience, more fly-by-night ""shamans"" will pop up looking to cash in on the boom. There have been other reported deaths, as well as reports of physical and sexual assaults. Six things to know about ayahuasca . Oswald admits she still struggles with grief and agreed to talk to CNN about her son's death because she hopes it might help warn young people like her son who are seeking ayahuasca treatment in the Amazon. ""If you're going to do this, you really really really need to research it and make sure wherever you find is properly supervised and there's medical supervision there,"" she said. ""And maybe even staying in the United States if you need to do it."" She remains suspicious about the whole ayahuasca tourism boom, saying  ""I just think it's become a fad, maybe it's like the LSD of the '60s."" But she said she would support some sort of regulation of the ayahuasca tourism industry if it ensured that participants would be monitored by medical professionals. ""I definitely think it needs to be monitored somehow.  It's a hallucinogenic drug. ... They call it a medicine, but it is a hallucinogenic drug,"" she said.  ""Obviously there's side effects to everything.  Anyone can have an adverse reaction to something.  You don't leave someone alone with a hallucinogenic drug (in their system)."" Oswald says she'll probably return to Peru one day when she's ready.  She is not considering any further legal action because, as she said, ""I can't put myself in that position to continue hating someone."" ""I just have to try to get this behind me.  I can't continue to hate the shaman. ...  I can't let him ruin my life any more than he already has,"" she said. ""I need to get beyond it.""","Kyle Nolan, 18, traveled to the Amazon seeking ayahuasca, but never returned .

"(CNN) -- Seventy years ago this week, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the GI Bill of Rights, formally the Servicemen's Readjustment Act, which the House of Representatives and Senate passed unanimously. It authorized unemployment compensation for a maximum of 52 weeks and guaranteed farm, home and business loans up to $2,000 to World War II veterans. Most importantly, by providing up to four years of education and training at annual tuition rates of up to $500 (the rate then charged by Harvard), plus a monthly living stipend, the bill made it possible for GIs to attend any college or university that would accept them. That was then. In 2014, the promise of full and equal access to higher education for men and women in the armed services, and, for that matter, for all academically qualified Americans, has not been fulfilled. Family income, not a concerted national initiative, still dictates whether students, including servicemen and women, go to college and which institutions they attend. More than 2 million World War II veterans went to college on the GI Bill. At least a quarter of them could not have done this without it. Many excelled; GIs appeared with regularity on honors rolls and deans lists. And they more than paid back the investment that had been made in them. Many of them achieved higher occupational status, more job security, better health and pension benefits and paid more taxes than their peers. They joined 50% more civic and political organizations and voted more frequently than their contemporaries in post-war America, according to Suzanne Mettler, author of ""Soldiers to Citizens: The GI Bill and the Making of the Greatest Generation"" and a professor of government at Cornell University. They also upended a pervasive assumption at the time that college was best suited to affluent Americans. Influenced no doubt by the performance of the first wave of GI Bill students, the 1947 Truman Commission, Higher Education in American Democracy, called for ""free and universal access to higher education"" for all Americans based on the interests, needs, and abilities of each student, but without regard to race, creed, sex, national origin or economic circumstances. The GI Bill and the Truman Commission Report touched off a golden age of higher education in the United States. Thanks in no small measure to funding for financial aid and research from states and the federal government, the number of undergraduates increased five-fold from 1945 to 1975, and graduate students nine-fold, according to Clay Shirky in ""The End of Higher Education's Golden Age."" In the past 70 years, GI Bill benefits have become significantly less generous than the provisions of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944. The Korean GI Bill of 1952, the Veterans Readjustment Benefits Act of 1966 and the Montgomery GI Bill of 1985 fell far short of covering tuition and fees at many public and private colleges and universities. While 52% of World War II veterans enrolled in private colleges and universities under the GI Bill, only 20% of the veterans of Korea and Vietnam were able to do so. It has become more difficult to ask, as Time magazine did in the 1940s, ""Why go to Podunk College when the government will send you to Yale?"" Although Sen. James Webb wanted his GI Bill, signed into law by President George W. Bush on June 30, 2008, to give veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ""the same educational chance that 'The Greatest Generation' had,"" it provided tuition payments only up to the most expensive in-state public university and restricted eligibility to individuals who spent three years or more on active duty. More generally, state appropriations for all higher education in recent years have leveled off or gone down, and federal funding for financial aid for undergraduates has not kept pace with the cost of attendance at public or private institutions. The maximum Pell grant, which accounted for about four-fifths of the cost at an average public university in the '70s, now covers about 31%. Little wonder, then, that three of four individuals from families in the top quartile of the economic distribution have received undergraduate degrees by age 24, but only one of five in the third tier and one of 10 in the fourth -- and the median debt at graduation is rising rapidly. Or that the United States is no longer at the top -- or even near the top -- of countries that send the highest percentage of their young people to college. More than ever, it is clear that educational achievement promotes economic growth, helps our nation compete in world markets and leads to high incomes as well as individual fulfillment. So let's mark the 70th birthday of the GI Bill not just by celebrating one of the greatest pieces of legislation in American history. We must also insist that Congress make it a high priority to provide the opportunity for our servicemen and women -- and for all young men and women in the United States -- to use higher education to fulfill the American Dream and go as far and as fast as their ambition, discipline and talent will take them.","Glenn Altschuler: 70 years ago, FDR signed GI Bill; more than 2 million went to college on it .

"Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou expressed optimism late Wednesday that the Greek people, in a vote to be held as soon as December 4, will support his plan to remain in the euro zone despite having to endure the austerity measures that Greece's continued membership in the euro club would require. ""I believe the Greek people want us to be a strong partner in the euro zone, a strong partner in Europe, and this is at stake,"" Papandreou told reporters who had assembled for the G-20 meeting in Cannes, France. ""This is at stake,"" he repeated. His optimism came in the face of an unveiled threat. If the referendum fails, Greece may be kicked out of the euro zone, French President Nicolas Sarkozy told reporters in a separate news conference in this chic resort town on France's southern coast. If Greece opts not to adhere to a deal reached on October 27, then it must leave the euro zone, Sarkozy said after meeting for more than two hours with Papandreou and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. But Papandreou said the referendum -- whose wording he would not discuss -- would prove key. ""I want to say that we will have a yes,"" he said. But first, Papandreou faces a confidence vote, slated for Friday, that will determine his own political fate. ""This is our first battle,"" he said. Asked whether he believed he would win, he said, ""I do hope so but, obviously, this is a democratic process."" Sarkozy said the ministers of finance of France and Germany will meet Wednesday. The countries are determined to help Greece, but require that Greece meet its commitments, he said, adding that the other members of the euro zone would not allow the euro to be destroyed. Greek authorities were informed that Europeans and the International Monetary Fund would disburse a sixth tranche of $8 billion euros only after the uncertainty is ended and the October 27 deal is implemented, Sarkozy said. Greece is now in the last third of its May 2010 bailout, which is worth a total of 110 billion euros. In a statement, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde lauded the October 27 plan, despite its belt-tightening requirements. ""I remain convinced that the agreement reached by the leaders of the Euro Area at their Summit last week, which includes a substantive reduction in Greece's debt burden and additional financial support for a new ambitious program, will greatly benefit Greece by helping to restore growth and create jobs,"" Lagarde said. She said she welcomed Papandreou's indication that the referendum would be held as soon as possible. ""As soon as the referendum is completed, and all uncertainty removed, I will make a recommendation to the IMF Executive Board regarding the sixth tranche of our loan to support Greece's economic program,"" she said. Asked whether withholding of the tranche would bankrupt Greece, Papandreou said, ""If everything goes well in the referendum, it's quite a few days before the sixth tranche is needed to pay up salaries and pensions and so on."" Papandreou did not attend the news conference at which his French and German counterparts spoke. The tense times in Cannes came on the same day that Greece's cabinet voted to support Papandreou's call for a referendum on the bailout plan. The vote was unanimous, though some of the ministers expressed criticism prior to casting their votes, CNN affiliate Mega Channel reported. German and French markets rallied Wednesday after tumbling Tuesday on the news of the referendum call, and London's FTSE also closed slightly higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average index closed up 178 points (1.53%). Papandreou is seeking public backing from the Greek people for last week's bailout deal, an accord that took months to craft. But the move has created turmoil in domestic politics and angered his European counterparts. A ""no"" vote could not only force Greece to abandon the euro but could send shock waves through the global financial system. Greek Foreign Minister Stavros Lambridinis told CNN he was confident the Greek people would vote yes. ""Everyone is getting a bit tired of doubting the wisdom of the Greek people and their commitment to Europe,"" he said, adding that Greece had proven its dedication in the painful measures it has already taken. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso appealed Wednesday for national and political unity, saying it would be ""critically important to have stability"" for the bailout deal to be implemented. ""Without the agreement of Greece to the EU/IMF program, the conditions for Greek citizens would become much more painful, in particular for the most vulnerable. The consequences would be impossible to foresee,"" he warned. Last week's deal would halve the country's sky-high debts, but at a price that has led to angry demonstrations in the streets of Greece. Vanessa Rossi, an economics adviser to Oxford Analytica, a global analysis firm, said Papandreou's referendum call was ""almost inevitable, given that the Greek population has continued to protest heavily against the plans agreed (to) in Brussels."" But she said the Greek people are aware that they would suffer greater financial pain if the country defaults. Meanwhile, several senior military leaders in Greece have been replaced. The Government Council for Foreign Affairs and Defense, which Papandreou chairs, decided Tuesday on ""sweeping changes in the armed forces' leadership,"" the Athens News Agency reported. The council replaced the general staff chiefs for the Greek army, navy and air force, the news agency said. Though the government said it was a long-planned, routine move, its sudden announcement after an extraordinary meeting with the heads of the armed forces makes many dubious, said Kostas Gemenis, an assistant professor of politics at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. Politicians have kept a tight rein on the Greek armed forces since a seven-year military junta was brought to an end in 1974, Gemenis said, but people's memories are long. He speculated that the government acted to allay any concern that the military -- which seized power in 1967 as the country was anticipating an election -- might be planning to repeat history. ""People want to be on the safe side and try to prevent even worse things happening,"" he said. He added that the news media had not treated it as a major event given the ongoing political and economic crisis. But the news of the bailout referendum rattled Papandreou's hold on power Tuesday, when a lawmaker defected from his party, leaving him with a majority of only two in Parliament. Milena Apostolaki said Papandreou had made ""an erroneous political decision"" in calling for the referendum. ""It jeopardizes the efforts and the painful sacrifices that are made by the Greek people,"" she told CNN on Wednesday. Sarkozy and Merkel issued a terse statement Tuesday saying they were ""determined to ensure the full implementation, without delay, of decisions adopted by the summit, which are necessary now more than ever."" In the United States, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney struck a similar note, saying Papandreou's move reinforced the need for Europe to ""implement rapidly the decisions they made last week."" Greece's former deputy finance minister, Petros Doukas, a member of the opposition New Democracy Party who is not currently in office, told CNN he doubted the referendum would take place. Papandreou is under enormous pressure from Europe, the markets and opposition forces within Greece to backtrack on the proposal, Doukas said. He suggested Papandreou would have to call elections or stand down as leader, as Greece was ""not governable"" with him as prime minister. Greece's opposition leader, Antonis Samaras, called Tuesday for a snap election, but it is unlikely he has the votes to force one. International lenders are demanding that Athens raise taxes, sell off state-owned companies and slash government spending, which would mean firing tens of thousands of state workers. The deal would wipe out 100 billion euros in Greek debt, half of what it owes to private creditors, and comes with a promise of 30 billion euros from the public sector to help pay off some of the remaining debts, making the whole deal worth 130 billion euros ($178 billion). The deal was greeted last week with fanfare as a way to keep debt woes in Greece and other European nations from spilling across other borders, threatening the 17 nations united under the euro currency. A weekend survey in Greece found nearly 60% opposed the debt deal, but other surveys have shown a more complicated picture. A survey carried out last week by Kappa Research for the Greek daily newspaper To Vima showed a majority of Greeks wanted a referendum on the international rescue plan, and that more would oppose it than accept it. But in the same survey, 70% of Greeks wanted to stay in the euro, according to RBS European Economics -- a result that may not be possible if they vote ""no"" on the referendum. Besides the Greek debt-reduction plan, last week's European Union deal pledged to quadruple the EU's bailout fund to about  $1.38 trillion and to raise the capital required to help cushion the region's banks from financial shocks.","George Papandreou speaks to media gathered for G-20 in Cannes, France .

"In the mid-March chill Thursday, the victims and their stories continued to emerge as firefighters ferreted through the piles of bricks and wreckage on the East Harlem block where a powerful explosion and fire leveled two buildings. They brought life to a vibrant neighborhood of corner bodegas, churches, shops and redbrick tenements whose ordinary rhythms were shattered when the Wednesday morning blast killed at least eight and injured dozens more.  The eighth body was recovered Thursday evening, a spokesman with the New York City Fire Department said. Among the victims was Carmen Tanco, a 67-year-old dental hygienist who relatives tried desperately to reach by cellphone. ""She's sassy, spicy, which is why her and I are so close,"" her niece, Marisela Frias, 44, said before learning her aunt had died. ""We have the same temperament, character. We tell it like it is, tell you the truth, whether you want to hear it or not. What you see is what you get."" Another victim, Griselde Camacho, 44, was a public safety officer at the Hunter College Silberman School of Social Work in East Harlem, the school's website said. ""Griselde was a well-liked member of our community, a respected officer and a welcoming presence at our Silberman building,"" said Jennifer J. Raab, the college president. ""Our deepest sympathies go out to her family, and we are committed to doing everything we can to support them in their time of great emotional need. We also know this is a difficult time for all those who knew and worked with Sergeant Camacho. All of you will be in our thoughts in the days ahead."" Camacho and Tanco were remembered by Carlton Brown, bishop of Bethel Gospel Assembly, on the church's Facebook page. ""Our hearts are heavy as we will truly miss these two beautiful women,"" Brown wrote. ""Many of us share fond memories on how they have blessed our lives with their warm smiles and caring natures. They were both faithful volunteers..."" Rosaura Hernandez, 21, who also perished in the explosion, was a line cook at Triomphe Restaurant, general manager Robert Holmes said. ""We liked her enthusiasm and raw talent,"" Holmes said.  ""It's a terrible loss.  My staff has taken it hard... She was solid as a rock, never got flustered.  She was calm, even-tempered. One of our line cooks was quite close with her.  When he heard she was missing, he said, 'Can I go find Rosie? I gotta look for her.'  I said, of course. It's a terrible tragedy. "" Though authorities have said a gas leak may have triggered the explosion, Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters Thursday that the official cause was under investigation. ""We know there was an explosion,"" he said, ""but we don't know everything about the lead-up to it."" The other fatalities were Andreas Panagopoulos, 43; George Ameado, 44; Rosaura Barrios, 44; and Alexis Salas, 22. One fatal victim remains unidentified. On Wednesday, one woman tried in vain to find her husband, Jordy Salas, who may have been on the second floor of one of the collapsed buildings. She fainted and was taken to a hospital. Desperate search for survivors . Near 116th Street and Park Avenue, once the heart of New York's large Puerto Rican community, firefighters tore at mounds of bricks in a search for survivors from the collapsed five-story buildings, which housed a piano store and an evangelical church, in addition to apartments. ""We (had) probably about two-and-a-half floors of debris, so we have it now down to about one, one-and-a-half floors,"" Edward Kilduff, fire chief of department, told de Blasio during a tour of the site. ""The victims have primarily been found on the left-center side about 20 feet in."" On Thursday, Con Edison officials said the utility received a call reporting a gas leak around 9:13 a.m. Wednesday from a resident at one of the newer buildings on Park Avenue. The utility dispatched a truck two minutes later, but it arrived after the explosion. The caller reported smelling gas the night before but did not call the utility at the time. Two gas repairs were made on the block in January 2011 and May 2013 following complaints of a gas odor, Con Ed CEO John McAvoy said. The utility looked back at 10 years of checks and repairs on the gas main on the block and found no ""historical condition,"" he said. In addition, Con Ed checks for leaks in the area on February 10 and February 28 detected no problems. Fire officials said they received no reports of gas leaks in the area in the last month, while police reported receiving no calls since 2010. Fire marshals, police arson investigators and the National Transportation Safety Board -- which probes gas explosions -- worked to determine the cause of the explosion. ""In one word, devastating,"" was how Robert Sumwalt of the NTSB described the scene Thursday afternoon. He called it an ""active search and rescue operation."" ""You have, basically,  two five-story buildings reduced to essentially a three-story pile of bricks and twisted metal."" Sumwalt said the agency was ""operating under the assumption that a natural gas leak led to an explosion,"" but that his team of investigators had not yet examined the crater where the buildings once stood. De Blasio said 66 people, including 14 families with children, had received temporary shelter. Some wreckage was still smoldering Thursday, with the fire whipped by the cold wind, de Blasio said. ""Our biggest concern now is the free-standing wall in the back,"" Kilduff said. ""That was a little more solid last night, but it burned overnight."" The massive explosion shook Manhattan's East Harlem section around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday. Surreal scenes after explosion . Colin Patterson said he was watching TV when a thunderous blast suddenly sent pianos hurling through the air in the shop where he works. ""They flew off the ground,"" said the piano technician, who also lives in the building in East Harlem. He told CNN affiliate WABC that he crawled through the rubble and managed to escape unharmed. A building department official said one of the two Park Avenue buildings that collapsed received a city permit last year for the installation of 120 feet of gas piping. The work was completed last June. In 2008, owners of the adjacent building, which also collapsed, were fined for failing to maintain vertical cracks in the rear of the building. The condition was not reported as corrected to the buildings department. There were a total of 15 units in the two buildings, officials said. Building department records detailed a litany of violations, dating back decades, for one of the collapsed buildings, including a lack of smoke detectors, blocked fire escapes and faulty light fixtures. The mayor told reporters that the report of the gas leak, which he said came about 15 minutes before the explosion, was ""the only indication of danger."" Blast shook Manhattan for blocks . Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano said responding firefighters barely missed the blast. ""If we were here five minutes earlier we may have had some fatalities among firefighters,"" he said. ""Not being here may have saved some lives."" Once a predominantly Italian neighborhood, the stretch of East Harlem saw a large influx of Puerto Ricans in the 1950s. It went on to be called Spanish Harlem and El Barrio. In the 1990s, many Mexican immigrants began to move into the area, which has been gentrified in recent years, with many mom-and-pop shops replaced by restaurants and bars.","An eighth body is recovered, says a fire spokesman .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A hacker's invasion of dozens of celebrity iCloud accounts, leading to the embarrassing leaking of nude photos, has lessons for us all. Here are five things you should know about what happened. Who's been hacked? There's a list of 100 celebrity women -- and one man -- whose photos were supposedly downloaded and stolen by a hacker. It includes A-listers, notably Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence, and D-listers whose names you may not recognize. Many of them only found out they were victims because of media reports naming them, but others -- such as Lawrence -- found out when social networks exploded with buzz about nude photos being distributed online. Lawrence and two others, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead and model-actress Kate Upton, almost immediately confirmed the images were of them. Several others -- including singer Ariana Grande, gymnast McKayla Maroney and singer-actress Victoria Justice -- said photos supposed to be of them were fakes. Justice later tweeted that she did, in fact, suffer ""a serious violation of privacy,"" with real photos leaked. While Rihanna is on the list, it might have been a waste of a hacker's energy, because the singer is known for frequently sharing revealing photos of herself on Twitter and Instagram. Being on the hacked celebrity list doesn't mean the hackers actually found any racy photos. Actress-singer Keke Palmer, 21, was on the list, but has never taken or kept nude photos on her phone or elsewhere, her mother said. The former Nickelodeon star, now playing Cinderella on Broadway, was taught early in her career about the dangers, she said. Others reportedly hacked include: Aubrey Plaza, Avril Lavigne, Cat Deeley, Farrah Abraham, Gabrielle Union, Hayden Panettiere, Hope Solo, Hillary Duff, Jenny McCarthy, Kate Bosworth, Kim Kardashian, Kirsten Dunst, Mary Kate Olsen, Meagan Good, Sarah Schneider, Selena Gomez, Teresa Palmer, Vanessa Hudgens and Winona Ryder. The one male on the list is actor Dave Franco, but to the disappointment of some female fans, no nude photos of Franco have emerged. Why would celebrities have nude photos of themselves on their cell phones? There may not be one answer for this, but distance from love interests could be a major factor. Actors spend months away from spouses and lovers while making movies. Musicians tour the world for months. Sexting can become a substitute for intimacy when a relationship goes long distance. Of course, some bathroom mirror selfies may be snapped and kept as a way to measure progress on a diet or to assess the need for a tummy tuck or update with the plastic surgeon. Other celebs, however, have enjoyed career boosts when supposedly inadvertent leaks of nude photos or videos have gone viral. Ask Kim Kardashian about that. Her career highlight was as Paris Hilton's personal assistant before the world discovered her sex tape. Another way nude photos might find their way onto a celebrity's cell phone is just plain naivetÃ©. Maybe they don't realize images on their iPhones are automatically backed up by iCloud, or perhaps they thought iCloud was a safe place for their data. How did the hacking happen? The hacker apparently took advantage of a security flaw in Apple's online backup service, iCloud. Many online services lock someone out after several unsuccessful attempts to log in, but not Apple's ""Find My iPhone"" app and iCloud. That has been changed by Apple in the aftermath of the nude celebrity photo scandal. But with unlimited guesses, a computer program can generate and test thousands of potential passwords until an account is entered. It is called a ""brute force"" attack. The tendency of many people to choose weak passwords and to use the same password for each service helped. Once a celebrity's ""Find My iPhone"" app password is discovered, the same password often can access iCloud. People might never know their accounts have been compromised. Another thing makes the famous more vulnerable. Wikipedia and many other websites provide biographical information that can help a hacker guess passwords or answers to security questions. Nearly a decade ago, Paris Hilton's Sidekick cell phone was accessed when a hacker guessed her password was Tinkerbell, the name of her famous teacup chihuahua. Apple said on Tuesday that the company's core computer systems, which house all its users' data, were not hacked. ""Certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet,"" Apple said. Also read: How celebrities' nude photos get leaked . How can you safeguard against hackers? Learn from the woes of your role models, the celebrities. Choose strong, hard-to-guess passwords. Long but easy to remember pass phrases that include numbers are suggested. Have variations for different email accounts, bank accounts and apps. If one is hacked, it does not compromise your entire virtual world. Many services, including Apple's, offer the option of two-factor authentication. After you enter your permanent password, you are asked for a second temporary password or number that is automatically generated and sent to you in a text message. A hacker would not have been able to access those celebrity photos unless he or she also had the celebrity's cell phone. Another safeguard is to be aware that even when you delete a photo or video from your iPhone, it is possibly backed up by iCloud. The service allows you to access images on all your devices, but it also keeps those you might think are deleted. Actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead tweeted that the photos of her that were leaked were ""deleted long ago."" Also read: Naked celeb hack lesson: 'Delete' doesn't mean delete . What penalty could the hacker pay? A stiff prison sentence is the short answer. Jennifer Lawrence's representatives said investigators have been contacted and ""will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence."" The FBI's Los Angeles office confirmed Monday that it was investigating the hacking. ""The FBI is aware of the allegations concerning computer intrusionsÂ and the unlawful release of material involving high-profile individuals, and is addressing the matter,"" the agency's spokeswoman said. The same office caught a Florida man who hacked celebrity email accounts in 2011. Christopher Chaney, whose targets included actresses Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis and singer Christina Aguilera, was charged with accessing protected computers without authorization, damaging protected computers, wiretapping and aggravated identity theft. Chaney is serving a 10-year federal prison sentence after pleading guilty in 2012. The hackers arrested in the Paris Hilton case, including a teenager, got jail time, too.

"Over the years, U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officers have tracked a host of elusive criminals, most of them within the United States. Here are some of the most prominent examples. Osama Bin Laden . The al Qaeda chief was tracked down nearly 10 years after the 9/11 attacks in a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. He was fatally shot after a team of elite Navy SEALs raided the bin Laden compound just after midnight on the morning of May 2, 2011. U.S. President Barack Obama made the decision to launch the raid on Pakistani territory, about 30 miles north of the capital, Islamabad, without knowing for certain whether bin Laden was there. But the work of intelligence analysts and the CIA proved accurate, and the long search for a man seen as America's enemy No. 1 was brought to a bloody conclusion. Two of bin Laden's bodyguards, one of his sons and the wife of one of the bodyguards  also were killed. The 'Unabomber' A string of mail bombings carried out by Ted Kaczynski over 17 years from 1978 claimed the lives of three people and injured 23 others. A year after his first device exploded, an FBI-led task force was formed to investigate. But it wasn't until 1995 that the FBI got the break they needed in the case, after publishing a 35,000 word manifesto sent by the man who became known as the ""Unabomber,"" he was finally identified by his brother.  On April 3, 1996, investigators raided Kaczynski's primitive cabin near Lincoln, Montana, and he was arrested. He's serving eight life sentences for murder. Christopher Dorner . Renegade ex-officer Christopher Dorner led California police on a days-long chase before he was tracked to a hideout in the San Bernardino Mountains east of Los Angeles. He took his own life February 12 while holed up in a cabin that caught fire when police fired tear gas canisters into it. He had killed four people and wounded three others as part of a vendetta against his former officers. Eric Robert Rudolph . It took police nearly seven years to hunt down the man who planted a bomb in Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park during the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, killing two. Other bombings followed, one deadly. Eric Robert Rudolph was identified as a suspect in 1998, and police came close to catching him in a search of homes and woods in Murphy, North Carolina, after two raccoon hunters found his abandoned truck. He eluded capture and, despite a $1 million reward on his head, it was not until May 2003 that a rookie police officer arrested him in Murphy. Rudolph is serving four consecutive sentences of life in prison plus 120 years for the attacks. James 'Whitey' Bulger . Alleged Boston mob figure James ""Whitey"" Bulger spent more than a decade on the FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list before he was captured in June 2011 in Santa Monica, California, after 16 years on the run. He was discovered hidden in plain sight, living in an apartment in the oceanside city near Los Angeles. His girlfriend, Catherine Greig, was sentenced to eight years in prison last summer for helping him evade capture. Bulger, the accused former head of Boston's notorious Winter Hill gang, now faces 19 murder charges, as well as charges including extortion, money laundering and narcotics distribution. D.B. Cooper . In November 1971, a man calling himself Dan Cooper hijacked a plane and succeeded in getting authorities to give him $200,000 and parachutes in return for letting passengers off the plane. The man then asked to be flown to Mexico but jumped out of the back of Northwest Orient Flight 305 somewhere between Seattle and Reno, Nevada. Authorities have never been able to prove whether the man survived or his actual identity. In 2011, the FBI said DNA on the necktie of the man known as D.B. Cooper did not match that of a new suspect in the case, but he was not ruled out as a suspect. The suspect's niece, Marla Cooper, who'd alerted the FBI, said she thought the man she knew as Uncle L.D. had died in 1999. The case remains unsolved. Bonnie and Clyde . The pursuit of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, the notorious lovebird bandits, made headlines across the United States during the Great Depression. According to the FBI, the authorities first picked up their trail in late 1932 thanks to the discovery of a prescription bottle filled for Clyde's aunt, which the pair had left in a stolen car. A warrant was issued for both in May 1933 and the hunt was on. The lovers and their gang carried out a series of daring robberies but evaded capture despite a number of violent brushes with the law. Bonnie and Clyde were finally ambushed and fatally shot by a police posse in Louisiana in May 1934. They are believed to have committed 13 murders and several robberies and burglaries, as well as auto thefts. John Wilkes Booth . Actor and Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth staked his claim as America's first presidential assassin on the night of April 14, 1865, shooting Abraham Lincoln in the back of the head during a performance of ""Our American Cousin"" at Ford's Theater in Washington, D.C.  Booth managed to escape the theater through a stage door, jumped on a horse, and headed south through Maryland.  Struggling with a broken leg and with federal troops in hot pursuit, Booth crossed the Potomac River into Virginia on April 21.   A few days later, however, authorities trapped him in a barn on Richard Garrett's Virginia farm.  They set fire to the barn on April 26, and shot Booth as he tried to defend himself. Timothy McVeigh . On the morning of April 19, 1995, disgruntled Army veteran Timothy McVeigh detonated a massive bomb in a Ryder truck left in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.  168 people were killed in the blast, including 19 children.  While the FBI was able to put together a sketch of McVeigh, he was ultimately apprehended by an Oklahoma police officer who pulled him over for driving a car without a license plate.  The officer noticed McVeigh was carrying a gun, and arrested him for illegal possession of a firearm.  While in custody, McVeigh was identified as the likely bomber.  He was executed by lethal injection at a federal facility in Terre Haute, Indiana, on June 11, 2001. The D.C. snipers . For three weeks in October 2002, the greater Washington D.C. area was virtually paralyzed by a series of random sniper murders.  Ten people were killed and another three were seriously injured before John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo -- a minor at the time -- were caught sleeping in their car at a rest stop off Interstate 70 in Maryland.   Muhammad was executed in Virginia in November 2009; Malvo was sentenced to six life sentences with no chance of parole.  The pair was also tied to murders in Washington State, Georgia, Louisiana, and Alabama.","Osama bin Laden was tracked down in Abbottabad, Pakistan, after a decade-long hunt .

In a ceremony at Buckingham Palace, Jolie was presented with the Insignia of an Honorary Dame Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George. Jolie, 39, is a special envoy to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, and she co-founded the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative with former British Foreign Secretary William Hague. ""It is a myth that rape is an inevitable part of conflict,"" Jolie said in June during the London opening of the biggest summit of its kind aimed at ending sexual violence in conflict. ""There's nothing inevitable about it. It is a weapon of war aimed at civilians. It has nothing to do with sex, everything to do with power."" The Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, hosted by the UK government, brought together representatives of more than 100 countries, as well as hundreds more experts, survivors, faith leaders, and staffers from NGOs and international organizations. According to UNICEF, the United Nations children's agency, more than 150 million young girls and 73 million boys experience sexual violence every year, and children in conflict-affected countries are the most vulnerable. Few perpetrators are ever prosecuted or convicted. CNN's Max Foster contributed to this report.","Jolie is recognized for her campaign to end war-zone sexual violence .

"Five European nations criticized Israel's decision to build thousands of new homes in occupied territory, summoning Israeli ambassadors for discussions on the matter. The British Foreign Office called Israel's move ""deplorable"" and said it threatens a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The foreign ministries of France, Spain, Denmark issued similar statements asking Israeli officials to reverse their decision. And Sweden's foreign minister said the Israeli ambassador there had been summoned to a meeting. The statements were the latest international fallout after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu authorized planning to begin for the new housing units in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, a move widely viewed as retaliatory after the Palestinian Authority won a U.N. bid to be recognized as a ""non-member observer state."" Read more: Clinton: New Israeli settlements a 'set back' for peace . British Minister for the Middle East Alistair Burt said that he met with Israeli Ambassador Daniel Taub Monday, calling for the government to reverse its decision. ""I also made clear that the strength of our reaction stems from our disappointment that the Israeli government has not heeded the calls that we and others had made for Israel to avoid reacting to the U.N. General Assembly resolution in a way that undermines the Palestinian Authority or a return to talks,"" Burt said in a statement. Officials at the Israeli Embassy in London could not be immediately reached for comment. Read more: Abbas calls for Palestinian unity after 'birth certificate' for Palestinian state . Speaking to reporters Monday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the United States opposes settlement activity and housing construction. ""We urge Israeli leaders to reconsider these unilateral decisions and exercise restraint,  as these actions are counterproductive and make it harder to resume direct negotiations to achieve a two state solution,"" he said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel also added her voice to the growing chorus, saying her government is ""worried"" about Israel's settlement plans for the West Bank, the chancellor's spokeswoman said. Read more: Israel plans new homes in East Jerusalem, West Bank . The chancellor's comments come ahead of a scheduled meeting Monday between Merkel and Netanyahu in Berlin. Israeli settlements are widely considered illegal under international law; Israel insists they are not. Netanyahu has not publicly acknowledged the approval of the new construction. But a senior government official has said the prime minister signed off on building ""3,000 housing units"" in the East Jerusalem, and has authorized planning and zoning for future construction in the West Bank town of Ma'ale Adumim. Given the latest move by the United Nations to upgrade the recognition of the Palestinian Authority, Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel will continue building in occupied territories that are of strategic interest. ""The answer to the attack on the Zionist character of the State of Israel obliges us to increase the tempo of settlement building plans in all the areas that the government has decided to settle in,"" the prime minister said in remarks before the start of his weekly Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem. There was also a report that settlers had moved into a building in a Palestinian neighborhood in East Jerusalem on Monday. Peace Now, an Israeli settlement watch organization, reported the move and described it as a ""dangerous provocation."" ""It seems as if the government has set the tone, and showed that it wishes to establish as many settlements as possible, to prevent the two-states solution,"" Hagit Ofran, the group's settlement watch director, said in a written statement. Read more: Palestinian bid explained . The Obama administration has repeatedly warned Israel against placing settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, particularly the Ma'ale Adumim area, because it would make it nearly impossible to create a contiguous Palestinian state. The Israeli Cabinet, in a unanimous vote Sunday, rejected the U.N. General Assembly's decision on Palestinian status, saying it changes nothing and will not be a basis for negotiations. The creation of a Palestinian state will require ""arrangements that ensure the security of the citizens of Israel, recognition of Israel as a Jewish state, and a declaration by Palestinians that the conflict is over,"" according to the Cabinet statement. Saeb Erakat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, called on the international community to take action against Israel, describing the settlement move as ""a flagrant violation of international law"" as well as an agreement signed by Israelis and Palestinians regarding peace talks.","Britain, France, Spain, Denmark and Sweden summon Israeli ambassadors .

"In the Facebook age -- when digital ""friends"" are just a click away -- the distance between people seems to be shrinking, according to data the social network released on Monday night. The adage maintains there are ""six degrees of separation"" between any two people on Earth, meaning that any two people would know each other through no more than six intermediary contacts. On Facebook, however, the average user is only 4.74 degrees away from any other Facebooker. ""Thus, when considering even the most distant Facebook user in the Siberian tundra or the Peruvian rainforest, a friend of your friend probably knows a friend of their friend,"" Facebook wrote in a blog post about its findings. That conclusion comes from a non-peer-reviewed study of 721 million active Facebook users, released by Facebook in collaboration with the Università degli Studi di Milano, the blog post says. Facebook calls the analysis ""the largest social network studies ever released."" The Palo Alto, California, company says 99.6% of all Facebook users studied were separated by five degrees or less from any other Facebook user; 92% were separated by only four degrees. Furthermore, that distance appears to be shrinking quickly. ""The average distance in 2008 was 5.28 hops, while now it is 4.74,"" Facebook says. While online Facebook friends are more likely to be linked to far-flung friends-of-friends, their immediate circles of contacts are remarkably homogenous in terms of age and geography. ""We observed that while the entire world is only a few degrees away, a user's friends are most likely to be of a similar age and come from the same country,"" the company writes. Within the United States, for instance, users on average are linked by three intermediary contacts. Facebook compares its work to that of 1960s social psychologist Stanley Milgram's experiments to prove that people are separated by only six contacts. The company explains Milgram's work like this: . ""The idea was first put to the test by Stanley Milgram in the 1960's. Milgram selected 296 volunteers and asked them to dispatch a message to a specific individual, a stockholder living in the Boston suburb of Sharon, Massachusetts. ""The volunteers were told that they couldn't send the message directly to the target person (unless the sender knew them personally), but that they should route the message to a personal acquaintance that was more likely than the sender to know the target person. ""Milgram found that the average number of intermediate persons in these chains was 5.2 (representing about 6 hops). The experiment showed that not only are there few degrees of separation between any two people, but that individuals can successfully navigate these short paths, even though they have no way of seeing the entire network."" There seem to be some obvious and fundamental differences between their reports, however. Not everyone knows all of their Facebook contacts in real life, of course. And the nature of digital friendship -- and even an online friend network -- takes on a different, and potentially more global, character than face-to-face networks of friends and contacts. ""We are close, in a sense, to people who don't necessarily like us, sympathize with us or have anything in common with us,"" Jon Kleinberg, from Cornell University, told the New York Times. ""It's the weak ties that make the world small."" Facebook acknowledges some methodological differences, as well. ""It is important to note that while Milgram was motivated by the same question (how many individuals separate any two people), these numbers are not directly comparable; his subjects only had limited knowledge of the social network, while we have a nearly complete representation of the entire thing,"" Facebook writes on its data blog. ""Our measurements essentially describe the shortest possible routes that his subjects could have found."" Thank you, computers. The findings do highlight the idea that the Internet is bringing people closer together -- something social media users can sense with or without this data. ""Ultimate proof that our world is getting smaller and smaller,"" one Facebook user wrote in a comment on the company's post. Another wrote: ""Awesome study! As a Milgram fan, I have been waiting years to see this analysis and it was worth the wait. Beyond any commercial purpose, Facebook data can help us understand how human society is organized, how ideas spread, and how we are connected to each other. Very cool."" One last burning question: Where does Kevin Bacon fit into this?","Data suggests Facebook seems to be bringing the world closer together .

As shoals of slim surgeonfish, parrotfish and clownfish wind between the gray rocks and drift in the current, they suddenly appear -- six Galapagos sea lions -- fat sleek bullets that zoom right up to my mask, upside down and mouths open, before twisting away at the last minute. Clambering back into the Zodiac dinghy -- or panga, as they're known in the Galapagos -- for the short return trip to the National Geographic Endeavour, one fellow ""explorer"" quizzes our accompanying naturalist. ""Oh, they won't bite you,"" he reassures us. Less reassuringly, he adds: ""Maybe. But just a little."" All the animals throughout the Galapagos National Park, more than 3,000 square miles of islands and islets 600 miles off Ecuador's mainland, are unperturbed by our presence. As there are no big predators -- or people -- on most of the islands the animals show no fear. And because many species are endemic to the Galapagos or even one of its 13 main islands, there's literally nowhere else in the world that you can have this kind of encounter. Sailing for science . I'm aboard the conservation-focused, naturalist-led Lindblad Expeditions-National Geographic Endeavour, a ship that lets passengers connect with life both above and below the waves through kayak and Zodiac excursions. Unbelievably, the uninhabited islands are much as Charles Darwin experienced them in 1885. Floreana, the second island on which Darwin landed, still has a ""post office"" that dates back to whaling days when crews would leave mail in a rum barrel. People still leave postcards here to be hand delivered by future visitors (those I addressed to the UK arrived within two weeks via hands unknown). ""It's a land left untamed ... One of the last parts of the world that's really wild,"" says fellow passenger Jim Calaway, an investments portfolio manager from Illinois. Daily recaps and talks by eminent scientists give cruises their characteristic research-meets-education feel. Voyages also have a strong photography slant, with most on-board naturalists certified as photo instructors by National Geographic. On Espanola, we boulder-hop along rough trails to reach an albatross nesting site, often stepping over groups of inky charcoal black marine iguanas. Genovesa's rough, lunar landscape seems inhospitable but teems with seabirds, including half a million red footed boobies -- the largest population in the world. Walking through prickly pear trees along a sandy path to Santa Cruz's aptly named ""Cerro Dragon,"" (Dragon Hill) we spot 28 dusty-yellow-brown Galapagos land iguanas. During that afternoon's ride to the eastern shore of Santa Cruz, dubbed ""El Eden"" for its scenic beauty, naturalist Giancarlo Toti doles out photo tips in time for us to snap a great blue heron feeding its gulping chick. ""I love these cruises because there's always one special thing for everybody,"" says Toti. ""This for me was the most special thing this time -- the heron feeding its chick. I have never seen that before."" Exploration highlights . Exploring the Galapagos Marine Reserve -- the second largest in the world at more than 50 square miles -- is as integral to the expedition experience as the guided hikes across the islands. On one of the daily snorkel expeditions I spot octopi, manta rays and a solitary Galapagos penguin, puffed up as if to officiate, on various excursions. Although the Endeavour -- named for Captain Cook's former command -- doesn't offer scuba diving, single-day excursions can be arranged with a local operator; it's also the only ship cruising the park with an underwater specialist and a remotely operated vehicle on board. While tourism to the region has tripled in the last 20 years -- just over 200,000 people visited the Galapagos last year -- visitors cruising the islands with responsible operators are helping to correct the damage caused by over hunting and species introduced by sailors, whalers and pirates. Sixty percent of each visitor's $100 entrance fee goes directly to the Galapagos National Park Service, funding rangers, naturalists and conservation work. Expedition leader Paula Tagle says only 84 ships have been allowed in the national park since she began working there in 1997, of which only four are similar in size to the 96-passenger Endeavour. There are strictly enforced park rules -- all visitors must be accompanied by a naturalist and vice versa, with no more than 16 people at any one time -- GNPS also schedules itineraries and landings for every ship to reduce pressure on the islands. The downside of such regimentation is there's no lingering. The upshot is never seeing another ship or any other ""explorers."" With an ever-growing influx of tourist dollars comes more domestic migration to the Galapagos. Tagle says poorly controlled growth in the inhabited areas and other types of non-cruise tourism are what need attention, rather than the national park area. ""I think 55% of visitors now do the [island hopping] kind of tourism versus 45% that come to the ships to spend the night, like [on the Endeavour]. ""But even more are going to the towns that have grown in a disorganized way,"" she adds. Tortoise breeding . Hearing the story of Lonesome George, the last known of the Pinta Island tortoises and the symbol of the Galapagos (he died at the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz in 2012) brings home the importance of the conservation controls. Although George's caretakers are still watching his two female companions in the hope that they might yet lay eggs -- female tortoises can store viable sperm in their bodies for up to three years before fertilizing themselves -- the species is now believed to be extinct. But many initiatives at the Darwin facility have been a success, including a project to revive Espanola's dwindling tortoise population using ""Super"" Diego, an especially virile Espanola tortoise returned to the Galapagos from San Diego Zoo. ""Eighty percent of the center's hatchlings -- so anywhere from 70 to 150 hatchlings a year -- come from Diego and his five girlfriends,"" naturalist Gilda Gonzalez tells me, with a wink. Santa Cruz is also a great place to see giant tortoises in their natural habitat. After a quick stop at a local sugar cane mill -- and a warming tot of the local moonshine -- we arrive at a highland farm, pull on rubber boots and stride off into orchards full of wild tortoises, flattening bushes and bulldozing saplings as they move from one juicy cluster of leaves to the next. Keen eyesight and hearing is not their strong suit -- smell is a giant tortoise's best sense -- so we approach from behind to pose for surreptitious photos as they continue their methodic chomping. It's only when we pass a tortoise close to the path that he notices us and retreats into his shell with a long, deflationary hiss. ""Today we are very lucky to see 11 tortoises -- sometimes there aren't any up here,"" says naturalist Ximena Cordova. ""It takes them three months to come up to the highlands to mate and three months to go back to the lowlands to give birth. These guys are smart -- they're waiting up here for the females to come back."" For me, seeing these huge hulking carapaces thriving once again in their natural habitat, is one of the most memorable encounters of the trip. ""Conservation is a big theme and every day we talk about results here, results there ... I think it gives hope to people to restore other places,"" says expedition leader Tagle. ""We have a saying -- if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.""

"(CNN) -- One is a hip-hop superstar and music mogul who dazzles audiences with his lyrical prowess, the other is a gregarious golfer who fights with the world's best to sink balls in the fewest shots. Their professions may be world's apart but rapper Sean ""P Diddy"" Combs and Ian Poulter have more in common than first meets the eye. That's because Combs and Poulter -- who are both ferocious self-publicists, lovers of the high life and boast their own clothing lines -- are two examples of celebrities building business around their personalities. ""Brand Poulter"" may have some way to go to match the Combs empire -- which includes a record label, restaurants and advertising operations worth $475 million according to Forbes Magazine -- but his entrepreneurial endeavour is showing promise. ""Poulter is a fascinating character, who's developed his brand in a very interesting and idiosyncratic way,"" said Gary Firkins, managing director of golf PR firm Landmark Media. For a player who is ranked 16 in the world and who has never won a major championship, the 35 year old has over a million followers on Twitter; a following which has led industry experts to call him golf's ""biggest brand"" outside of Tiger Woods, who has only 750, 000 followers. ""[Via Twitter] the strength of his personality is allowed to shine through, and people feel like they know him,"" Firkins added. Poulter's clothing label, IJP Design, launched in 2007. And while it's yet to return a profit, the residual benefits to the Englishman's celebrity have been obvious. ""I always wanted to have my own fashion line,"" Poulter told CNN. ""My mum worked in the fashion industry, and one of my first jobs was selling clothes on a market stall. ""You definitely need to have an interest in what you wear and what looks good. My philosophy has always been 'look good, play great' -- it may not matter so much to others, but it works for me."" Poulter's style is not to everybody's taste. At the 2004 British Open, he wore a pair of union jack trousers and a backwards flat cap. The following year his trousers were emblazoned with the tournament's famous trophy -- the sacred Claret Jug. It was the marriage of loud clothes and strutting confidence that earned Poulter the ""peacock"" tag he resents to this day, and helped make him one of golf's most divisive personalities. He didn't help his cause with a rather bold claim in January 2008. ""I haven't played to my full potential and when that happens, it will be just me and Tiger (Woods),"" Poulter said. To some it was arrogance, to others a refreshing moment of honesty. But, like his choice of trousers, everybody in golf was talking about it. ""In a world where athletes are so closely managed, Poulter brings a heart-on-the-sleeve honesty that appeals to people,"" said Firkins. ""He's allowed to express himself, and in this internet age -- where people demand openness and honesty, he very much suits the culture. People respond to him."" It is on the internet that Poulter is concentrating much of his marketing effort -- with the launch of a web site home for the ""pro golfer, fashion designer and personality,"" and a Twitter account with 1.1 million followers. In golfing circles, only 2009 British Open champion Stewart Cink has bigger numbers on Twitter (1.2 million), while P Diddy has 3.5 million followers. ""I love Twitter as it allows me to give my fans an inside view to what's going on in my world,"" Poulter said. ""It doesn't matter if its video or pictures or just 140 characters, it's a great way to give some insight into my life."" It is a colorful life that Poulter spends between Milton Keynes and Florida these days -- one that allows him to indulge his passions for football and basketball, with regular trips to watch Arsenal and the Orlando Magic. And then there's his collection of luxury cars to maintain. Poulter's garage boasts a Bentley Continental GT, a Ford GT, Nissan GTR, an Aston Martin DB9 and a Mercedes Benz GT -- to name but a few. When you factor in time for his family -- Poulter is married to Katie and has three children -- it is maybe not surprising he is regularly asked if he gives enough time to the sport that made it all possible. ""You can't hit golf balls 24/7, you need some kind of a life,"" Poulter said. ""I have that with my other interests. I get 26 weeks off a year and there is enough time in a day to enjoy many interests."" On the course, Poulter's most notable successes have come in the Ryder Cup. Three times he's represented Europe in the biennial match against the United States, winning eight of his 11 matches and endearing himself to millions in the process. The closest he came to winning a major championship was a runners-up finish in 2008, but that hasn't stopped his global brand reaching an appeal far in excess of all but one of the active players who've managed the feat. ""You only have to see the ticket sales when Poulter plays in a tournament to see the power of his brand,"" said Neil Gray, of golf marketing firm GMS. ""From our perspective in England, the only brand bigger in golf right now is Tiger Woods.""","Golfer Ian Poulter turned professional in 1995, and has won 10 European Tour events .

"Connie Siskowski is helping young people who have to take care of an ill, disabled or aging family member. Through her nonprofit, the American Association of Caregiving Youth, Siskowski has provided assistance to more than 550 child caregivers in Palm Beach County, Florida. CNN asked Siskowski for her thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2012. CNN: What was your reaction when you found out that you'd been selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Connie Siskowski: It was awesome. I was so excited. We've really been hoping that would happen. This meaningful opportunity will help us reach even more children and families, and get more support for the kids. ... It means the possibility of raising more awareness and being able to achieve our ultimate goal that no child should have to drop out of school because of caregiving responsibilities. CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean to the American Association of Caregiving Youth? Siskowski: I hope it will help people understand that the kids are a part of the health care delivery system and that they should be recognized. We're not advocating that children should do this or be in this position, but they are. So we want to make it as safe as possible and arm them with the knowledge base that they need. (This recognition) will help us continue the path that we are taking, to provide continued and expanded services locally and to replicate our work in other parts of the United States. Right now we have affiliates with signed agreements in four states, and we're talking with others. The model is to partner with existing nonprofits who would like to reach this population of children and who'd like to make a difference in the lives of these kids, who are in situations through no fault of their own. CNN: How will you use the $50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Siskowski: It will be solely used by our organization to fulfill its mission. We provide professional support to the children in school, out of school and at home. We provide tutoring (and) respite to give kids and families a break. We've provided computer support. We do a home visit to link families to resources. We provide sponsored activities and transportation to and from them. We have a camp. So all these things work together to strengthen the child, to give them more confidence and the skills that they need to go on to become healthy, productive adults. We have lots in the hopper. We have so much to do; we've only scratched the surface. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? Siskowski: It's really a joy to see the lives of children and their families be transformed, and for them to know that someone out there cares about them. That it doesn't take a whole lot to make a difference. And everyone can do it. The kids don't have a voice, so they need somebody to be their voice, to be their advocate. ... When these children receive the recognition they so deserve, along with the academic and skills support they need, they are able to remain in school and have confidence in themselves and what they are doing so they can become healthy, productive adults. Plus, having the chance to participate in fun activities allows them to experience a bit of childhood otherwise lost.

"(CNN) -- This year will mark 51 years since President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963. Whether you were alive at the time or not, you probably know that Lee Harvey Oswald killed the President, only to be fatally gunned down by Jack Ruby two days later. You probably also know there are hundreds of conspiracy theories about who was behind the assassination, and whether Oswald was the lone gunman or if there was another shooter on the infamous grassy knoll. Here are five things you may not know about the assassination of the 35th president of the United States: . 1. Oswald wasn't arrested for JFK killing . Lee Harvey Oswald was actually arrested for fatally shooting a police officer, Dallas patrolman J.D. Tippitt, 45 minutes after killing Kennedy. He denied killing either one and, as he was being transferred to county jail two days later, he was shot and killed by Dallas nightclub operator Jack Ruby. 2. Assassinating the president wasn't a federal crime in 1963 . Despite the assassinations of three U.S. presidents -- Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield and William McKinley -- killing or attempting to harm a president wasn't a federal offense until 1965, two years after Kennedy's death. 3. TV networks suspended shows for four days . On November 22, 1963, at 12:40 p.m. CST -- just 10 minutes after President Kennedy was shot -- CBS broadcast the first nationwide TV news bulletin on the shooting. After that, all three television networks -- CBS, NBC, and ABC -- interrupted their regular programming to cover the assassination for four straight days. The JFK assassination was the longest uninterrupted news event on television until the coverage of the September 11 attacks in 2001. 4. It led to the first and only time a woman swore in a U.S. president . Hours after the assassination, Vice President Lyndon Johnson was sworn in as president aboard Air Force One, with Jacqueline Kennedy at his side, an event captured in an iconic photograph. Federal Judge Sarah Hughes administered the oath, the only woman ever to do so. 5. Oswald had tried to assassinate Kennedy foe . Eight months before Oswald assassinated JFK, he tried to kill an outspoken anti-communist, former U.S. Army Gen. Edwin Walker. After his resignation from the U.S. Army in 1961, Walker became an outspoken critic of the Kennedy administration and actively opposed the move to racially integrate schools in the South. The Warren Commission, charged with investigating Kennedy's 1963 assassination, found that Oswald had tried to shoot and kill Walker while the retired general was inside his home. Walker suffered minor injuries from bullet fragments.","President John F. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963 .

"The horrific bombing at the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday reminds us of both our physical vulnerability and the fragility of our peace of mind.  Even as we grieve for the victims and worry about friends and family in the vicinity, because these were bombings -- clearly an act of terror on someone's part -- they shake us. We are touched to the core as we have been by 9/11. Old familiar questions that have been tamped down for years re-emerge. How do we make ourselves safe?  Can we?  And of course, we ask: Who? Why? For us, the first duty in the wake of the Boston attacks is to make sure that no additional related threats remain.  At the same time, we must care for those injured in the attacks and the families of those who lost their lives.  But 9/11 taught us one more thing.  We must care for ourselves, for the truth.  We must fight to retain our equilibrium and our cool. Earlier this month at a Police Executive Research Forum in Washington, police discussed an approach that law enforcement has encouraged in recent years in the event of attacks like mass shootings: Often the right thing to do is to take action, rather than run away. This makes some sense, particularly if there is a visible perpetrator to pursue or victims to aid. But in the moments after an attack, we need to remember, too, that reflection and careful, fact-based analysis is more important than reflexive acts that appear to respond to but only compound the terror and, ultimately, the costs of the attack. In the hours immediately after the Boston attacks, there were the understandable, prudent reactions.  New York and Washington entered heightened states of alert.  Friends and families texted and called one another asking whether their loved ones should leave Boston.  No doubt others organizing public events in the next few weeks or months began to rethink their security precautions. President Obama's brief, measured remarks expressing sympathy for the victims, resolve to seek justice and a commitment to providing full federal support for state and local authorities was a perfect example of an appropriate response. But elsewhere it was fevered. The Twitterverse exploded with graphic images and rumors and reactions and over-reactions.  It captured the hysteria of a crowd, the diverse mix of healthy and unhealthy reactions, almost as a photograph would: a high resolution picture of the state of mind of countless bystanders and interested parties. Reading the tweets and the first stories, hearing of ground stoppages at airports and security moves at the White House, it was all too easy to remember the mood in the wake of 9/11, a moment in history when justified horror fed panic. But this was translated into a crackdown on civil liberties, an unnecessary war — and some very dark days for the United States. Tragedies like these call for swift response from police and emergency workers, not to mention Homeland Security officials.  But experience tells us that the ultimate accessories to the terrorist are the innocent and well-intentioned who spread and exaggerate the terror.  Just as we should track down perpetrators, we should also remember that if we remain calm and rational, we can minimize the effectiveness of these acts and in so doing make them less attractive for terrorists to undertake. This is how people in countries plagued with violence, like Israel, have long handled attacks.  Be resolute about security, intelligence and enforcement.  But place equal emphasis on maintaining order and ensuring the minimum possible disruption of daily life. With more than 100 casualties reported at the time of this writing, it is easy to let anguish fuel anger and worse. Sadly, we have been here before.  It is time we used past lessons to ensure that we respond today and in the future better than we have in the past—with equal parts of both purpose and perspective, with as much focus on maintaining life as usual as in dealing with its cruel disruption.","David Rothkopf: Boston blasts remind us of our vulnerability and fragility of state of mind .
He says first duties: Care for victims, assess threat. Then, keep cool; this a lesson of 9/11 .

"Athens, Georgia (CNN) -- Wilmot Greene sat among charred remains of his iconic Georgia Theatre recalling the fire that reduced it from an alternative rock icon to rusted steel girders and walls of black bricks. A year after an unexplained fire gutted the century-old musical cradle of bands such as R.E.M., the B-52s, Indigo Girls and Widespread Panic, Greene still kicks himself for missing Rockinwood play the last show before the fire. He says he'd missed only about 20 shows since buying the place in '04. The fire broke out overnight and raced throughout the building. ""I got a call at about 6:45 in the morning, and by the time I got here, it was completely engulfed in flames,"" Greene said. ""And that was the beginning of the longest day of my life."" Theater production manager Ric Wallace watched the roof collapse atop piles of blazing wood, leaving firefighters with few options but to let the fire burn itself out. ""It was one of those moments where the town stood still for a day,"" Wallace said. ""It was a stunning day, you simply cannot put words to it ... it's a total life-changing event."" Their emotional investment in the music palace tracks back to the '80s. Greene remembers the exact day he fell in love with the Georgia Theatre -- October 1, 1989 -- when he was still one of thousands of students at Athens' University of Georgia. The Georgia Theatre had recently reopened as a music venue and was featuring a local band, Pylon. The theater had operated as a concert venue for three years before closing in 1981. He went to see the show with some friends and fell in love with the place. The club had a vast open floor where hundreds of sweaty music fans would dance the night away and a balcony upstairs for those that wanted to just sit back and enjoy the show. In a college town where music is king, the Georgia Theatre is its castle. Fifteen years later, Greene owned his beloved music palace. The list of bands that graced its stage reads like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame roster: The Dave Matthews Band, The Police and The Ramones played here. Sting and Joey Ramone hung out backstage and prepped for shows in the dressing rooms. See list of bands that have played at the Georgia Theatre . R.E.M. and the B-52s' Kate Pierson shot their 1991 video for ""Shiny Happy People"" inside the theater -- joined by a cast of dozens of extras and in front of a brightly colored watercolor backdrop. R.E.M. bassist Mike Mills remembers playing the theater in the band's earlier days. ""The Georgia Theatre was the scene of many great nights of music and fun for me, both as a player and a fan of music. We all look forward to its returning better than ever,"" Mills said. Jeremy Trimmer, sax player for Six Shades Blue, remembers the theater as ""the top place to play. There was no better place. Your goal as a musician in that town was to play there.""  In 2001, John Mayer shot the video for his first big hit,""No Such Thing,"" here. Mayer played to a room full of adoring fans, and he stood in front of the theater with his name in big red letters on the signature marquee. In ""Athens Burning,"" a documentary celebrating the theater and the local music scene, R.E.M. manager Bertis Downs says its size, quality and character did much to help Athens become a laboratory for new music. ""A theater of that size can really be a key part of trying to build any kind of music tourism destination. That, Athens clearly is, in a lot of ways,"" said Down. The Georgia Theatre was one of those places where you could go to a show, and even if you had no idea who was playing that night, you were guaranteed to have a great time. Greene and Wallace enjoyed a meal at The Globe restaurant across East Clayton Street, where they told stories and showed their passion for the theater. To them, it was much more than just a building and a stage. It still holds memories of amazing shows and good times with friends at a place that was celebrated for bringing people together. They had an endless supply of stories centered around the building. Wilmot remembers seeing bands that would later gain national fame play the theater. ""I remember seeing Phish there one time and there were like 50 to 100 people there, and I remember thinking to myself, this band will change my life,"" Wilmot said. ""I ended up following Phish around for an entire summer after that."" David Barbe remembers using the theater as a recording studio. ""Wilmot closed down the theater for a week for us to record the album 'Sand and Lines' for Venice is Sinking. It was really Wilmot's vision to why that record was made,"" said Barbe, who heads the university's music business program. ""It was all about the performance and the room, and it's all about as little from the mouth to the ear as you can possibly get. I thought about that experience a lot the day of the fire."" The fire not only created a cultural void in the town, but left a big question among fans of the theater: what sparked it? ""We know it started in the guest dressing room, but we're not sure,"" said Greene. ""It was either a cigarette, or an electric fan, or a wiring problem. We'll probably never know."" Watch Wilmot and others tell their story about the theater . In the days after the fire, Greene made the decision to rebuild. ""I knew it was something that I had to do,"" he said. ""This building had been here 120 years, and I couldn't let it end on my watch."" The cost to rebuild is more than $4 million, Greene said. Insurance got them to zero, because it only covered what was owed on the building before the fire. Georgia Trust donations site for the Georgia Theatre . Although fundraising has proven difficult during a weak economy, the Athens community has been very supportive. The town's Terrapin Beer has brewed a special series commemorating the history of the theater with proceeds going toward reconstruction. Benefit concerts have raised some money, most notably a Zac Brown show at Atlanta's Fox Theatre last year. But Greene and Wallace still have a long way to go. They say they've only raised $167,000 so far. Construction has begun on the crippled theater and they hope to have it open for concerts by spring or summer of next year. See the Georgia Theatre's updates on rebuilding . ""One of my roles in the redesign is to make it the best venue possible, not just only for customers, but the musicians, too,"" Wallace said. ""We see the musicians as our customers just as the audience is."" From Wilmot's perspective, it's about returning to what he says is the greatest thing about owning a music theater: ""Seeing the look of joy on people's faces. It's a religious experience.""","Fire gutted alt-rock cradle of bands such as R.E.M. and B-52s in Athens, Georgia, in 2009 .

"You don't have to be a Soviet wheat farmer to realize that five-year plans aren't much fun. Unless, that is, you start scheduling in new theme park openings. A worldwide construction boom is currently underway that will bring in a slew of incredible new rides, slides, sights and frights over the next half-decade. Stefan Zwanzger, aka the globetrotting Theme Park Guy, has been keeping an eye on what's coming so he can be among the first in line. Here's his list of the best of attractions of the near future.

Zwanzger says: ""Almost every decade in the past half-century we've had a new Disneyland somewhere in the world and this is the one for this decade. ""Design-wise it's going to be a bit of an experiment, and I think that is a wise move. ""I am absolutely convinced it's going to be a success because Disney innovates, surprises and invests into attention to detail, you've got more than a billion people in China, and it's still quite inconvenient for Chinese mainland passport holders to travel abroad.""

These include a Legoland (the world's seventh), a Bollywood-themed park and Motiongate Dubai (a Hollywood-themed park). Status: Under construction, scheduled for completion in 2016. (read Theme Park Guy's updates). Zwanzger says: ""This is a revival of the Dubailand idea, with a different developer. ""Dubailand was intended as a massive development with eight, nine or 10 theme parks in the deserts of Dubai. In the end, not one was built. ""Once again, the plan is to create a hub of family entertainment in the Middle East and in Dubai. Alcohol-free, family-orientated fun under the sun. ""If you ask me, it's the perfect fit for the region. It's also a smart move to limit it to three parks in the first phase, rather than 10.""

Avatar Land (near Orlando, Florida) Concept: A park that brings to life Pandora, the blue-peopled planet of James Cameron's sci-fi movie ""Avatar."" Avatar Land will sit within Disney's Animal Kingdom. Status: Under construction, scheduled for opening in 2017 (read Theme Park Guy's updates). Zwanzger says: ""This will be James Cameron's first theme park involvement since the 'Terminator 2: 3-D' ride he directed and designed together with Gary Goddard for Universal Studios.

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- World leaders converge Tuesday in New York to focus on climate change, with the clock ticking down toward a summit this year in Denmark, where a global climate change pact is to be signed. In Melbourne, a man dressed as Australia's prime minister highlights that leaders must ""wake up"" to climate change. Negotiations for the global pact have stalled, and Tuesday's gathering is aimed at jump-starting those talks. Chinese President Hu Jintao, U.S. President Barack Obama, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Rwandan President Paul Kagame are among the world leaders expected to speak Tuesday. Roundtables are also planned, all with the overarching and generally accepted goal of limiting the rise of Earth's temperature to within 2 degrees Fahrenheit above its temperature before the industrial revolution. Hu's speech will be of particular interest, given that his country is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, analysts said. ""Climate change has the potential to really fundamentally reshape dynamics between these big and significant countries in a way we've never seen before,"" said Julian Wong, a senior energy analyst at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank based in Washington, D.C. Leaders are expected to discuss how climate change affects energy, food security, trade, finance and international security, according to the United Nations. ""We have an unprecedented opportunity to prevent climate change from slipping out of control and to jump-start the transformation to a safer, cleaner, more prosperous green economy that benefits all,"" said U.N. Secretary-General Ban-Ki-moon. The full-day summit comes before representatives of the world's largest economies meet Thursday in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for the Group of 20 summit.

"(CNN) -- Was Barack Obama really born in America? A new CNN investigation reveals what most analysts have been saying since the ""birther"" controversy erupted during the 2008 presidential campaign: Obama was born in Hawaii on August 4, 1961. Period. While the president has made light of the controversy, the question remains political red meat for some of his critics. A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll showed that nearly 75% of Americans believe Obama was definitely or probably born in the United States. More than four in 10 Republicans, however, believe he probably or definitely was not born in America. Evidence again shows Obama born in Hawaii . The U.S. Constitution says only ""natural born"" citizens can become president -- a vague clause that some members of the birther movement contend disqualifies Obama because, they insist, he was born outside the United States. Skeptics contend, among other things, that Obama was born in his father's home country of Kenya. Potential GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump recently seized on the issue, saying he had doubts about Obama's background. Zakaria: The fantasy of Donald Trump . CNN investigators in Honolulu found nothing to reinforce those doubts. Dr. Chiyome Fukino, a former director of the Hawaii Department of Health and a Republican, told CNN in her most extensive comments to date that she has ""no doubt"" Obama was born in the state. Obama's 2008 campaign produced a certification of live birth, a document legally accepted as confirmation of a birth and routinely used for official purposes. Fukino went one step further, taking advantage of a state law that allows certain public officials to examine a person's actual birth certificate if there is a ""direct and tangible interest."" The president's certificate, she said, is stored in a vault in the building that houses the Department of Health. Ironically, unlike the certificate of live birth, it is no longer accepted for official usage. Obama's certificate is ""absolutely authentic,"" she said. ""He was absolutely born here in the state of Hawaii."" Arizona governor criticizes birther ""distraction"" To see what happens when someone born in Hawaii requests a birth certificate, CNN asked a current resident of the state -- Stig Waidelich -- if he could get a copy of the document. Waidelich was born hours after Obama in August 1961. Like Obama, Waidelich's birth was announced at the time in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin newspaper. Waidelich, like Obama in 2008, was given a certification of live birth in response to his request. Could Obama's 1961 birth announcement in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin be a fake? Some conspiracy theorists say yes. Longtime Honolulu newspaper reporter Dan Nakaso says no. ""It's not possible,"" Nakaso said. ""Under the system that existed back then, there was no avenue for people to submit information that way. ... The information came directly from the state Department of Health."" Indeed, as CNN confirmed, all birth announcements at the time came directly from hospital birth records. Trump questions birth certificate . Could Obama, a self-proclaimed Christian, be preventing the distribution of copies of the original birth certificate because it identifies him as a Muslim? Fukino says no. The original certificate includes no mention of the president's religion. And indeed, other original certificates from that time don't mention faith. Obama could file a Freedom of Information Act request to view his original birth certificate and make copies. But at this point, the White House maintains, nothing will satisfy the doubters. Rick Smethurst, a 2008 John McCain voter who now lives in Obama's childhood home in Hawaii, counts himself among the doubters. He said he wants to find someone who saw Obama immediately after the president was born. Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie said he did. Abercrombie, a Democrat, was friendly with Ann Dunham, Obama's mother, and remembers celebrating the birth. ""Of course, we had no idea at the time that the future president of the United States was that little boy, that little baby,"" Abercrombie recalled. But ""we are very, very happy ... that took place."" Professor Alice Dewey of the University of Hawaii was a faculty adviser to Dunham and also knew the future president when he was a child. She called the controversy ""funny."" She said there is ""no way"" Obama wasn't born in the state. Dewey remembered a conversation in which Dunham compared the birth of Obama with that of his sister, Maya, who was born overseas. ""She said, 'When I had Maya, it was a lot of more difficult because Indonesia doesn't believe in painkillers while you're giving birth. ... Of course, in the United States, giving birth to Barry (Obama's childhood nickname) was quite different and much more comfortable,' "" Dewey recalled. Waidelich's mother, Monika, said she believes she saw Obama in Honolulu's Kapi'olani Medical Center next to her son in 1961. ""In those days, there were hardly any other black babies,"" she said. The hospital wouldn't show patient records from 1961, but the state's African-American population was less than 1% at the time. Regardless of the evidence, there may be no convincing some of those who question the president's origins. ""I find it a bit amusing in the sense that (the issue) keeps resurfacing over and over again,"" Fukino said. ""It really tells us that the whole conspiracy notion is out there (and) that if there is an issue that needs a following, they will find one. ""No matter what you do or say, it make no difference,"" she said. Abercrombie, who tried to put an end to the controversy when he became governor, said he hopes that ""people who have this political orientation toward the president respect us here in Hawaii."" ""Respect his mother and father,"" the governor urged. ""Respect the people I loved and the people that I knew, and the little boy who grew up here in paradise and became president."" That, the evidence suggests, may be easier said than done. CNN's Alan Silverleib contributed to this report. Watch Anderson Cooper . 360° weeknights 8pm ET.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Supermodel Naomi Campbell has been sentenced to 200 hours of community service after pleading guilty to assaulting two police officers following an ""air rage"" incident at London's Heathrow Airport. Naomi Campbell, seen here arriving at court, was convicted of an assault charge in New York in 2007. According to the British Press Association, the 38-year-old pleaded guilty at Uxbridge magistrates' court, west London to two counts of assaulting a police officer, one count of disorderly conduct likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress and using threatening, abusive words or behaviour to cabin crew. Prosecutors described how Campbell kicked and spat at police, used foul language and accused airline personnel of racism after she was told that one of her bags had not been placed on the British Airways flight to Los Angeles on 3 April. The London-born model was also ordered to pay $400 to each of the police officers she attacked and $300 to Miles Sutherland, the captain of the British Airways plane she disrupted, in addition to a $4,600 fine.  Watch as Naomi Campbell arrives at court » . Chairman of the magistrates' Peter Yiacoumi said he had given Campbell credit for her guilty pleas and previous good character. He said: ""These offences are aggravated because they were committed within a lengthy incident in a confined space on an aircraft. Whilst we accept that the loss of your suitcase would have been stressful your subsequent behaviour cannot be justified."" A spokeswoman for British Airways told PA Friday: ""We take all cases of disruptive behaviour extremely seriously and take action where appropriate. ""We have banned people from travelling with us in the past and we reserve the right to ban passengers."" BA would not comment specifically on the Campbell case, but it is understood that the supermodel has been banned by the airline. In 2007, a New York court handed Campbell a community service sentence and ordered her to attend anger management classes as punishment for hitting her maid on the head with a mobile phone. The London-born model had been arrested a year previously after hurling the phone -- reportedly a jewel-encrusted BlackBerry -- which smacked her housekeeper on the head, leaving her needing four stitches. She pleaded guilty to a charge of reckless assault.","Naomi Campbell could have faced prison for up to six months .

"The FBI says it has opened a criminal investigation of the Veterans Affairs Department, which is grappling with a scandal over long waiting lists to provide care and allegations that paperwork was faked to make delays appear shorter. FBI Director James Comey told a House hearing on Wednesday the bureau's Phoenix office has joined an ongoing review by the VA inspector general. The move at least partly satisfies requests from key members of Congress from both parties who have pressed for a full probe by the Justice Department as the scandal accelerated in recent weeks and led to the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki in May. Officials have said the inspector general is sharing findings with federal prosecutors, and the Justice Department could launch a full-blown criminal probe if any of the information meets the standard for doing so. CNN has reported over the past seven months on the VA problems, including that managers in Phoenix and elsewhere used secret waiting lists to cover up the amount of time it took for veterans to get appointments. At Wednesday's hearing, Comey would not say whether the investigation would be expanded beyond the initial allegations at the Phoenix medical facility, but said the FBI was ""working with the VA IG and will follow this wherever the facts take us."" IGs are the internal watchdogs of federal agencies and usually conduct administrative audits for fraud or other abuse. Sometimes those reviews result in federal prosecution. Typically, the Justice Department waits for reviews by inspectors general to be completed before deciding whether to jump in. In this case, a Justice Department spokesman said, ""At the department's direction, the FBI has instructed agents in its Phoenix office to conduct an investigation into the allegations related to the VA. Federal prosecutors will be working with these investigators to determine whether there is a basis for criminal charges."" Widespread problems at the VA's health care facilities have persisted for years but questions intensified over the past several months amid fresh media and congressional scrutiny. An internal Veterans Affairs audit released Monday found that tens of thousands of newly returning veterans wait at least 90 days for medical care, while even more who signed up in the VA system over the past 10 years never got an immediate appointment they requested. The VA has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care. Despite efforts to address some issues in recent years, including reductions in backlogs for benefits and the number of homeless veterans, the long waits have continued for newly enrolled veterans to get initial appointments for care. Reasons for the chronic problems include the increasing number of veterans returning from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a bonus system that rewarded managers for meeting goals regarding access to treatment. Lawmakers for weeks have flocked to TV cameras and issued statements to urge the Justice Department to start its own investigation. But there's recent precedent for the department to be wary of the political pressure. The department quickly announced its probe into the IRS after reports of alleged targeting of conservative political groups. The IRS investigation continues, but so far investigators haven't found proof of a chargeable crime, according to people briefed on the case. As a result, the department is under fire from Republican lawmakers for not bringing charges. Separately, the House has unanimously approved legislation to permit veterans experiencing long wait times for medical appointments to seek care at non-VA facilities at the government's expense. A similar measure has been proposed in the Senate, which could act later this week. Vets could get care outside VA under bill passed by House .

"Bill Clinton and George W. Bush sounded like old college buddies when they appeared in Washington on Monday. You'd never know that Clinton was the candidate who made Bush's father a one-termer, or that Bush ran for office in 2000 promising to restore ""honor and dignity to the White House"" after Clinton left. Things are genial now that both men have their presidencies behind them and are focused on their legacies as former presidents. They appeared together on Monday to announce a new leadership program through their respective foundations. But at times, it appeared the announcement took a back seat to the presidents' relationship. The two former commanders in chief joked with and about each other, told stories about their relationship, and even offered commentary about the number of selfies each is asked to take. ""He used to call me twice a year, in his second term, just to talk,"" Clinton said about Bush. ""We'd talk -- depending on how much time he had, 'cause he was busier than me -- somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes, for several years. It meant a lot to me."" Clinton said he and Bush ""talked about everything in the right world. He asked my opinion, half the time he disagreed with it. But I felt good about that, I thought that was a really healthy thing."" Bush and Clinton were together Monday to announce the Presidential Leadership Scholars program, a partnership between their respective presidential centers, as well as George H.W. Bush's and Lyndon B. Johnson's centers. The program's aim is to bring ""motivated leaders across all sectors an opportunity to study presidential leadership and decision making and learn from key administration officials, practitioners, and leading academics."" It is well-documented that Clinton has grown closer with the Bush family since his presidency. Clinton and George H.W. Bush worked together after the Asian tsunami in 2004 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005, while Clinton and George W. Bush worked together after the 2010 Haitian earthquake. Monday's event was a mutual admiration festival. As Clinton heralded their post-presidency friendship, he regularly touched Bush's arm. When the Arkansas Democrat reflected positively on Bush's father, George H.W. Bush, Bush 43 looked at Clinton and said, ""Thank you, you are right."" When Bush gave Clinton advice on becoming a grandparent -- ""Get ready also to be, like, the lowest person in the pecking order in your family"" -- the two laughed and shared a hearty handshake. Bill and Hillary Clinton are expecting their first grandchild this fall as their only daughter, Chelsea Clinton, is pregnant. Hillary Clinton attended Monday's event and sat near the back. During the event, Bill Clinton's phone rang and the former president joked that ""only two people have this number and they are related to me."" ""I hope I'm not being told I'm about to become a premature grandfather,"" Clinton said to a chorus of laughs. The former presidents were asked to reflect on each other's leadership qualities. Clinton said Bush was decisive and did what he thought was best for the country, even if Clinton sometimes disagreed with him. ""I actually learned a lot watching him over the years,"" Clinton said. Bush, in a briefer answer, said Clinton was an ""awesome communicator"" who can ""really lay out a case and get people all across the political spectrum to listen."" ""[There is] a lot to admire about Bill Clinton,"" Bush said, before noticing that he had said less than Clinton had. ""Is that enough?"" Bush said. ""It was a lot shorter than your answer, I know."" The differences between Bush and Clinton were also on full display. Clinton offered wordy, detailed answers, while Bush used more folksy one-liners and quips to engage the crowd. Both joked about how Bush often said he ""didn't do"" nuance. Clinton said that before the event they ""were laughing about having to go to restaurants and having to spend our time taking selfies"" with fans. Without skipping a beat, Bush said, ""At least they are still asking, you know."" Bush takes Ice Bucket Challenge, challenges Clinton .","Bush and Clinton's genial relationship now that both have left office is on full display .

"A top retired general has confessed to taking bribes, becoming the highest-profile figure in China's military to be caught up in President Xi Jinping's war on corruption. Xu Caihou, formerly the vice chairman of China's Central Military Commission that runs the two-million strong People's Liberation Army (PLA), was also expelled from the Chinese Communist Party and had his rank of general revoked, according to a statement from military prosecutors cited by the state-run Xinhua news agency Wednesday. The seven-month investigation, which began in March this year, found that Xu took advantage of his position to assist the promotion of other people, accepting huge bribes personally and through his family. He was also found to have sought profits for others in exchange for bribes taken through his family members. The amount of bribe was ""extremely huge"", the statement added. The allegations against Xu, 71, were announced on June 30 when President Xi presided over a leadership meeting to expel the retired general and three other senior members from the ruling Communist Party. Zero tolerance . In a statement released after that meeting, President Xi and other Chinese leaders reiterated their ""zero tolerance"" for corruption in the government and military -- long a lightning rod for mass discontent across the country -- but they also acknowledged the anti-graft task would be ""ongoing, complex and formidable."" The three other former senior officials ousted from the Communist Party for corruption were Jiang Jiemin, a former minister in charge of state assets; Li Dongsheng, a former vice minister of public security; and Wang Yongchun, a former deputy head of state-owned oil behemoth China National Petroleum Corporation. State media characterized Xu as a big ""military tiger"" caught in the massive anti-graft campaign launched by President Xi, who is also the commander-in-chief. After becoming the head of the Communist Party in late 2012, Xi banned official extravagance -- from banquets to year-end gifts -- and vowed to target ""tigers and flies"" alike in his fight against corruption when describing his resolve to spare no one regardless of their position. OPINION: China corruption charges no longer shock . Xinhua recently touted the catching of 30 ""tigers"" since Xi took power less than two years ago. Zhou Yongkang . Some China watchers have noted ties between an increasing number of disgraced officials to Zhou Yongkang, the former domestic security czar who has been rumored to be under investigation for some time. Jiang, Li and Wang have long been considered Zhou protégés. State media has reported official probes into many of Zhou's family members as well as former associates in the domestic security apparatus, state oil industry and southwestern Sichuan Province -- three places Zhou once ruled. If announced, Zhou would become the highest-ranking official ever to face corruption charges in the history of the People's Republic. In 2013, some 182,000 officials were disciplined while courts nationwide tried 23,000 corruption cases, according to the Communist Party's disciplinary commission. State media has cited the trial and conviction last year of former high-flying politician Bo Xilai -- though called politically motivated by Bo supporters -- as one prime example of President Xi's determination to clean up the Party.","Xu was a former vice chairman of the Central Military Commission .

"A lock-unlock lever on the doomed Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo was moved earlier than it should have been, the National Transportation Safety Board said Sunday night. But the agency's acting chairman stressed it was unclear whether pilot error, mechanical problems or a host of other possibilities caused the spacecraft to disintegrate in the air. ""We are still a long way from finding a cause. We are months and months away,"" NTSB Acting Chairman Christopher Hart said. And despite a debris field spanning 5 miles, investigators have found almost all the parts of the spacecraft needed for the investigation, Hart said. The accident killed co-pilot Michael Tyner Alsbury, 39. A memorial fund has been set up for him. Co-pilot alert and talking . The surviving co-pilot is ""alert"" and speaking, the company that partnered with Virgin on the test flight program said Sunday. ""Peter Siebold, the director of flight operations at Scaled Composites, was piloting SpaceShipTwo. He is alert and talking with his family and doctors,"" the company said in a statement. ""We remain focused on supporting the families of the two pilots and all of our employees, as well as the agencies investigating the accident."" NTSB investigators have yet to interview Siebold. ""We have not because doctors did not recommend we do an interview at this stage,"" Hart said. Inflight breakup? SpaceShipTwo disintegrated Friday, just two minutes after the space plane separated from the jet-powered aircraft that carried it aloft. At the time, it was about 45,000 feet above, and about 20 miles northeast, of Mojave, California. SpaceShipTwo helmed by experienced pilots when flight failed . While the NTSB hasn't determined what broke the test aircraft apart, ""when wreckage is dispersed like that, it indicates the likelihood of in-flight breakup,"" Hart said. A team of 13 to 15 investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board will be on site in the Mojave Desert for about a week. But analyzing the data from the test aircraft will take much longer. Analysis: Will space accidents deter pioneer tourists? 'We're going to learn' Virgin Group founder Richard Branson said Sunday he didn't personally know Alsbury, but had the privilege of knowing Siebold. ""Mike was a dear friend and inspiring colleague to the many, many friends he left behind. My heart goes out to his parents, his wife and children, his sister and the rest of his family and friends,"" he said about Alsbury. He wished Siebold a speedy recovery. On Saturday, Branson said that the company is ""determined to find out what went wrong."" When asked about the future of Virgin Galactic, Branson said the company's goal is still putting people safely into space. ""I think millions of people in the world would love one day to have the chance to go to space, and this is the start of a long program,"" he said. Years of flight experience . The two test pilots had both had a great deal of flight experience. Alsbury worked at Scaled Composites and logged more than 1,600 hours as test pilot and test engineer in Scaled aircraft. Siebold had worked for Scaled Composites since 1996 and had 17 years and more than 2,000 hours of flight experience. Both had degrees in aeronautical engineering from California Polytechnic State University. Deadly day for space tourism -- but future 'rests' on such days, official says . As for the program itself, SpaceShipTwo had flown 55 times, 35 times on its own, Branson said in a statement. WhiteKnightTwo, the jet-powered ""mothership"" charged with transporting SpaceShipTwo to altitude, has flown 173 times, Branson said. ""We've always known that the road to space is extremely difficult -- and that every new transportation system has to deal with bad days early in their history,"" Branson said. ""Space is hard -- but worth it. We will persevere and move forward together."" Future of the program . For years, Virgin Galactic has planned to sell trips in which SpaceShipTwo would transport passengers about 62 miles above Earth -- the beginning of outer space -- and let them experience a few minutes of weightlessness before returning to the ground. It's unclear what the failure of the space plane will mean for the program. Virgin Galactic planned to send paying customers on SpaceShipTwo as early as next year. The company released a statement late Sunday. ""At Virgin Galactic, we are dedicated to opening the space frontier, while keeping safety as our 'North Star'. This has guided every decision we have made over the past decade, and any suggestion to the contrary is categorically untrue,"" it said. ""Now is not the time for speculation. Now is the time to focus on all those affected by this tragic accident and to work with the experts at the NTSB, to get to the bottom of what happened on that tragic day, and to learn from it so that we can move forward safely with this important mission."" Virgin has sold more than 700 tickets, each costing more than $250,000, for future flights. Several celebrities have already signed up, including Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher, Leonardo DiCaprio and Stephen Hawking.

"India said Thursday that it had successfully carried out the maiden test flight of its longest-range nuclear-capable missile, which can apparently travel more than 5,000 kilometers. The Agni V rocket took off around 8:03 a.m. local time (10.33 p.m. Wednesday ET) and ""met all the mission objectives,"" said S.P. Das, director of the missile test site. The missile, whose stated range of about 3,100 miles puts major Chinese cities within its striking distance, was fired from the coast of the eastern Indian state of Orissa. The Indian defense minister, A.K. Antony, congratulated the Defense Research and Development Organization for the ""immaculate"" success of the missile launch. India says the missile development is not an aggressive initiative and that its military program is based on building a credible minimum deterrent with a ""no-first-use"" policy. ""Our missiles are purely for deterrence,"" Ravi Gupta, a spokesman for the Defense Research and Development Organization, had said ahead of the launch. In November, India successfully tested the fourth version of Agni, meaning ""fire"" in Hindi, with a range of 3,500 km. Built years earlier, Agni I could travel 700 km, according to Indian defense authorities. India borders two nuclear-armed states -- its arch-rival Pakistan; and China, with which it fought a brief but bitter war in 1962. The launch of the Agni V is ""another milestone in our quest to add to the credibility of our security and preparedness and to continuously explore the frontiers of science,"" India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said Thursday. The flight of the missile is a significant move to demonstrate India's technological competence, Uday Bhaskar, a strategic expert, said earlier this week. But the homegrown missile will undergo several tests more before it becomes fully operational, he said. A successful experiment, Bhaskar said, would bring India closer to the group of nations capable of building intercontinental missiles. Currently, the five permanent member nations of the U.N. Security Council -- the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France -- are thought to have developed such technology, he said. As well as homegrown hardware like the Agni, India buys a lot of arms from overseas. It has overtaken China as the world's biggest importer of weapons, according to a recent report by the the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Siemon Wezeman, a senior analyst with SIPRI, said last month that India's defense spending reflects its regional security concerns and Delhi's global aspirations. China's relative decline as an arms importer comes at a time when it is increasing its overall defense budget, investing in major projects such as the development of a stealth fighter jet and an aircraft carrier program. Many of these weapons are produced domestically.","Singh says the launch adds credibility to India's security .

"Seattle, Washington (CNN) -- They come from all walks of life. One teenage girl cuts her thighs after piano lessons to avoid the crushing pressure for perfection. She sees a therapist twice a week, but she never gets better. Another young woman makes dangerous cuts to her arms and wrists when she is anxious. She is on her fourth foster placement because no one can handle her behavior. Another burns her fingers with a cigarette lighter when she hears her parents fight. She's been hospitalized twice in the past year. Stories such as these are heard daily by those of us who study and treat self-injury -- that is, any activity resulting in intentional bodily damage to oneself. It is a syndrome found across cultures and socioeconomic classes (although it tends to be a bit more common among the more well-off), and it appears to be on the rise. Though cutting the skin with sharp objects is the most common method used, especially by girls, other means of self-injury including head banging, overdosing, burning, hanging, drowning and shooting. Given its potential for death and serious injury, this phenomenon has received increasing media attention, with a number of movies, such as ""Secretary"" in 2002, portraying the phenomenon. From my perspective, this is an urgent public health issue, yet funding for research and treatment lags well behind funding for other behavioral disorders, such as autism. Self-injury is troubling for several reasons. First of all, almost 400,000 adolescents and young adults were treated medically for self-inflicted injuries in 2006, the most recent year for which these injuries were counted. One recent study revealed that the number of children and adolescents in the U.S. who were hospitalized for depression, which is sometimes accompanied by self-injury among youth, increased by 27 percent between 1997 and 2007. Second, self-injury is associated with crippling psychiatric distress. Girls who engage in such behaviors score lower than their peers on almost all measures of positive psychological adjustment, such as sociability, and higher than their peers on almost all measures of negative psychological adjustment, such as depression and delinquency. Third, adolescent self-injury is linked to adult borderline personality disorder -- a chronic and difficult to treat mental health condition characterized by impulsive behaviors, difficulties self-regulating emotions, mood instability and high rates of suicide. Finally, self-injury is the single best predictor of suicide. Intentional self-injurers are about 75 times more likely to kill themselves than others in the population, an especially alarming statistic. Scientists are not sure why rates of self-injury appear to be on the rise, or how to stop the trend. When teens who self-injure are asked why they do it, most say the behaviors help them regulate overwhelming negative emotions, including anger, sadness and rejection. This emotion-regulating function may occur because injuries trigger the release of endogenous opioids, chemicals produced by the body that relieve pain. Over repeated episodes of self-harm, the endogenous opioid system may become more efficient at reducing physical and psychological pain. Recent studies conducted at high schools and universities reveal that almost 20 percent of individuals self-injure at least once, and about 11 percent self-injure repeatedly. Given how common the behavior is -- and the alarmingly high risk of eventual suicide -- one might expect self-injury to be a major public health priority. One might also expect considerable investment into basic science aimed at understanding the brain mechanisms involved and treatment-outcome research aimed at developing effective interventions. Unfortunately, this has not been the case. Little is known about the brain mechanisms of self-injury, particularly in adolescence, and traditional approaches to treatment usually involve inpatient hospitalization, which is more cost-effective than individual care. However, when treated in groups, as is often the case in hospitalization, self-injuring girls often become worse, not better, an effect known as contagion. (Note that this can also occur through access to Web sites and Web postings in which self-injurers share strategies.) Nevertheless, there has been some progress toward understanding and treating adolescent self-injury. On the basic research side, Christina Derbidge, a graduate student in my lab, is conducting a study in which the brains of adolescent girls who engage in self-injury are imaged as they cope with negative emotions. On the treatment side, Dr. Marsha Linehan's Dialectical Behavior Therapy at the University of Washington is signs of hope. The therapy is a variant of cognitive therapy and an effective treatment for adults with borderline personality disorder. It has been adapted to adolescent patients with encouraging results. Despite these positive developments, a much greater investment is needed. For fiscal year 2010, the National Institutes of Health --far and away the primary source of funding for health research in the world -- projects spending $41 million on suicide and suicide prevention (NIH does not report specific funding figures for self-injury). In contrast, NIH expenditures for autism are expected to be $141 million in 2010. Corrected for the higher prevalence rate of suicide, this translates into a six-fold greater investment per person with autism. Indeed, across the past five years, NIH has spent more than $700 million on autism research, with impressive results in terms of treatment effectiveness and our understanding of the genetic and neural underpinnings of the disorder. Given the urgency of preventing suicide among our youth, a similar investment is needed in self-injury research.","Theodore Beauchaine says he sees rise in youth self-injury, such as cutting, burning .
Syndrome crosses culture, class; it's linked to suicide, yet research funding lags, he says .

"Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, hospitalized this week after the discovery of an abdominal tumor, has decided not to seek re-election. At the advice of his doctors and family, Ford said he will focus on getting better. ""My heart is heavy when I tell you that I'm unable to continue my campaign for re-election as your mayor,"" the controversial politician said in a statement Friday. Ford's term officially ends December 1. ""People know me as a guy who faces things head on and never gives up, and as your mayor I have done just that,"" Ford said. ""Now I could be facing a battle of my lifetime, and I want the people of Toronto to know that I intend to face this challenge head on, and win."" Ford asked his brother, Doug Ford, to run for mayor in the October 27 balloting. ""He told me that he needed me to take the torch while he focuses on getting better,"" Doug Ford said at a press conference Friday evening outside his mother's home. ""He told me he couldn't bear the thought of city hall returning to the old days at the expense of the good, honest, everyday people,"" he said. Doug Ford, who has been one of the mayor's strongest supporters during the controversies that have plagued him, said he is honoring his brother's request and would have more details next week about his own campaign for mayor. The president of Humber River Hospital said Wednesday that the mayor --  just over two months removed from treatment for substance abuse --  has been admitted to the hospital, where doctors will try to get ""a definitive diagnosis."" ""It is being investigated further and we need to determine exactly what type of tumor it is, and then we can decide on what type of treatment is required,"" said Dr. Rueben Devlin, the Toronto hospital's president. According to Devlin, Ford has been ""complaining of abdominal pains"" for over three months that got worse over the last 24 hours. That prompted the mayor to go the hospital, where a CT scan revealed the tumor in his abdomen. It's not known yet if the tumor is malignant, according to Devlin. The health ailment adds to the list of struggles facing Ford, whose fall from grace began in May 2013 with the release of a cell phone video that appeared to show him smoking crack cocaine. The Toronto city council largely stripped him of his mayoral powers months later over those and other allegations of bad behavior. Ford didn't back down, though, instead vowing ""outright war"" on the city council. The mayor apologized for ""a lot of stupid things,"" including having used crack cocaine, but he refused to resign or enter rehab. In fact, despite all the criticism and his becoming a punchline for jokes in Canada as well as the United States, Ford launched a bid for re-election. This past spring, after a local newspaper reported on a new video that allegedly shows him smoking crack cocaine, Ford relented on one front: by going into rehab. He returned to work in late June, after a two-month rehab stint, saying he was ""ashamed, embarrassed and humiliated"" by some of his past actions. But he refused to resign or refrain from campaigning, saying to the voters of Toronto, ""I look forward to serving you for many, many more years.""

"Peshawar, Pakistan (CNN) -- Zara brushes her dark brown curls away from her face, nose scrunched up in concentration as she stares at the white board. She looks down to write and then pauses, placing her little finger on her chin in contemplation. Like a typical 7-year-old, her favorite part about school is the games. ""Hide and seek,"" she says in English, giggling sheepishly. ""I like hide and seek."" But no matter how hard she tries, there are some things this little girl and her friends can't hide from. ""I am scared from the bombs,"" she sighs. ""I am very afraid."" Read Arwa Damon's blog entry about the children of Peshawar on Afghanistan Crossroads . Zara lives in Peshawar, capital of Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province, tucked right up against the Khyber Pass next to Afghanistan. When the Pakistani military began its multiple offensives targeting its own homegrown militant networks in the tribal belt, the retaliation was felt in Peshawar. It was the residents of this ancient city of 3 million who bore the brunt of an ongoing brutal bombing campaign. Suddenly nothing was safe. People's lives were shattered as the city found itself at the very core of Pakistan's war on terror. A truck bomb in a popular marketplace frequented by women and children killed more than 100 people. Checkpoints sprang up all over the city, meant to instill a sense of security. But at the same time they created targets of opportunity as they and government buildings were regularly attacked. Zara's school is tucked way down an alley off what once was Peshawar's most popular modern market street. Just out front sits a checkpoint. These days her school door remains bolted, the bus drivers act as additional guards and parents are discouraged from coming. The school administration wants as few adults loitering around as possible, afraid of suicide bombers. But there is little the school can do to keep the children safe from the demons that haunt them. ""When there is an explosion,"" Zara says, pausing before she continues, ""it feels like the Taliban are here. I imagine corpses are all lying on the ground."" Her eyes widen and she giggles. ""I get scared."" She may be laughing, but psychiatrists say it's deadly serious: The children are confronting a faceless and unknown enemy. ""The exterior smile is a deception; it's the only coping mechanism the child has,"" Dr. Rizwan Taj, a psychiatrist in Islamabad, says. ""The child needs counseling, protection, and they are not getting that."" The children simply don't understand why their little world has been affected. The problem is, Rizwan explains, the parents can barely cope with the paralyzing fear that defines their lives. ""The confusion isn't just for the children. It's for the adults, as well. The confusion for the adults as to why this is happening, why is this happening repeatedly, it trickles down to the children,"" Rizwan says. And as those emotions intensify, people look for scapegoats. At Zara's school we also meet 10-year-old Qainat. We ask her what she likes to do. ""I like to do painting and I like to ..."" she pauses and looks away. ""But I don't like America because she is so bad, and also India."" She says it's what her parents are telling her, explaining that the Afghan refugees who have lived in the city for decades aren't responsible. Having children growing up in such an intense and charged atmosphere surrounded by so much violence can have detrimental effects on society. ""You will have a very insecure population, a population that can be easily polarized,"" Rizwan says. He says it's going to take a collective effort from the government, the media and the international community to prevent Pakistan's next generation from being a lost generation materializing into a dysfunctional society. But Pakistan's medical services are already stretched to the limit. So for the time being, Zara and her friends are left to their own devices, trying to survive in a world their elders can't even make sense of -- carrying with them the knowledge that each day could be their last.","Children in Peshawar live with effects of military offensives and militant retaliation .

"Reading the international press, one would be forgiven for thinking that Venezuela is on the verge of collapse. Over the past decade, all sorts of predictions have been made, ranging from catastrophic election defeats to the implosion of the Venezuelan economy. But the fact these predictions have failed to materialize has not deterred many of Venezuela's most fervent critics in their quest to engineer a constant and misleading narrative of impending disaster. More: Chavez returns after Cuba cancer treatment . The reality is that ever since President Hugo Chavez was first elected, Venezuela has defied these negative predictions and brought unprecedented social progress to the country over the last 14 years. Since 2004 poverty has been reduced by half and extreme poverty has been cut by 70%. University enrolment has doubled, entitlement to public pensions has tripled, and access to health care and all levels of education have been dramatically expanded. Venezuela now has the lowest levels of economic inequality of any Latin American country as measured by the Gini coefficient. Our country has already achieved many of the Millennium Development Goals, and is well on target to achieve all eight by the 2015 deadline. This progress has been achieved by using Venezuela's vast oil revenues to transform the lives of ordinary people. The sheer scale of our oil reserves -- the world's largest -- guarantees the complete sustainability of the model in which the country's resources are used to stimulate growth in the economy and aid development. But Chavez's most significant achievement has been to trigger the awakening and empowerment of the majority. A majority of Venezuelans have seen vast improvements in their living standards and, as a consequence, they have continued to defend their interests at the ballot box. The Venezuelan people are very clear about what they want. President Chavez was re-elected in October 2012 with 54% of the vote in an election that boasted an 81% turnout. The Venezuelan people showed their support for the government again in December 2012 in the gubernatorial elections, which saw Chavez's political party win 20 out of 23 states. Governments in Europe and other parts of the world could only dream of these levels of support after 14 years in power. This shows that social progress in Venezuela has been consolidated and that there is a desire to further expand this progress. In the coming years, the Venezuelan government will continue to respond to the needs of the Venezuelan people. Hundreds of thousands of new homes have been built over the last two years which have not only greatly improved living standards but also provided jobs and contributed to a boom in the construction industry. The government is well on its way to meeting its target of building three million new homes by 2019. While many economies around the world are shrinking, the Venezuelan economy grew by 5.5% in 2012. Against the backdrop of a continuing international financial crisis, commerce in Venezuela grew by 9.2% and communications by 7.2%, manufacturing grew by 2.1% and the oil sector grew by 1.4% -- making Venezuela one of the fastest growing economies in Latin America. At a time when many countries are attacking the rights of the most vulnerable sectors of society, Venezuela is providing ever greater protection for low-income senior citizens and single-parent families with younger children or disabled dependents. The failed development models of previous governments condemned millions of Venezuelans to poverty. Before the election of Chavez in 1998, Venezuela suffered years of falling GDP. The country had one of the worst economic records in the world -- a record that led to mass social unrest and violent military crackdowns. Venezuela will continue on its path of social progress and empowering ordinary citizens. The greatest hope for the future is the people know that they alone hold the power to determine the direction the country will take. After so many failed predictions, isn't it time to respect Venezuela's democracy and the will of the people?","Despite perceptions, Hugo Chavez has brought social progress to Venezuela .

"Images from Instagram, the photo-sharing app that lets user spruce up their work with a slate of arty and retro filters, no longer show up on Twitter, a popular place to share them. The change, foreshadowed when photos began appearing buggy on Twitter last week, was confirmed Sunday by both Twitter and Instagram. It marks a shift in how the app will be used and signals a new round in the escalating feud between two of the Web's social media titans. Since Facebook bought Instagram in April, it's been apparent that Facebook and Twitter, which rank one-two in popularity among social-networking users, are distancing themselves from each other. In the Internet age, data and dwell time equal money. With Facebook pushing to grow its mobile revenue (and modest stock price) and Twitter still searching for effective ways to translate its popularity into profit, this rift was perhaps inevitable. In July, Twitter stopped letting Instagram users find friends via Twitter they may want to follow on the photo app. (They did the same for popular blogging site Tumblr after buying rival blogging platform Posterous.) In the most recent move, users began noticing that images posted to Twitter were cropped weirdly. By Monday, sending an Instagram photo to Twitter simply posted a link directing followers to Instagram's recently beefed-up website. The move was first mentioned by Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom last week at Le Web, a tech conference in Paris. ""We're working on building an awesome Web presence, which we just launched,"" Systrom said. ""We revamped our Web properties, and now we're able to staff up teams to work on Web properties with the Facebook acquisition."" A Facebook spokeswoman confirmed Monday that Instagram turned off support for ""Twitter cards,"" the app that lets third-party images appear on the site. In its statement posted Sunday, Twitter also confirmed what happened. ""Instagram has disabled photo integration with Twitter. As a result, photos are no longer appearing in Tweets or user photo galleries,"" the statement reads. ""While tweeting links to Instagram photos is still possible, you can no longer view the photos on Twitter, as was previously the case."" At Le Web, Systrom said the shift wasn't payback for Twitter shutting down its friend-finder function. But he also said there are no plans to disable Instagram images on other sites. ""This is more of a one-off,"" he said. Underlying all the back-and-forth, of course, is the possibility that hard feelings still exist after Twitter's reported offer to buy Instagram was spurned in favor of a reported $1 billion deal with Mark Zuckerberg's Web juggernaut. By allowing its images to show up on Twitter, Instagram gave Twitter users no incentive to visit its own site or mobile app. The amount of time visitors stay on a website is an important figure for advertisers choosing which sites to patronize. Keeping Instagram photos off Twitter also could encourage users to publish their pictures to Facebook, which allows them to show up in all their glory. Meanwhile, there are reports that Twitter is planning its own photo-filtering app, which could be out by the end of the year. Such moves and countermoves are to be expected, many in the tech blogosphere were saying Monday. ""The companies obviously realize how important photos are to getting users to share and interact on the web, so it looks like the competition isn't stopping any time soon,"" wrote Eliza Kern for GigaOM. Others were saying this won't change the actual Twitter-Instagram user experience all that much. ""Breaking: one click to see Instagram photo now requires two clicks,"" wrote TechCrunch columnist MG Siegler on Twitter. ""Trillions of man click hours lost.""","The Twitter-Facebook fight escalates with latest Instagram move .

"(CNN) -- Even a sleep expert gets tired sometimes. ""It's been a long day,"" explains a weary-sounding Nick Littlehales, as he answers the phone to start an interview explaining how he went from aspiring golf pro to the go-to recovery guru for top soccer clubs and Olympic athletes. While, for many of us, sleep deprivation often compounds into a seemingly neverending spiral of exhaustion, Littlehales has dedicated most of his adult life to finding the tools that break the cycle. If he has a late night, he knows how to factor it into his schedule and immediately get back on track. ""Sleep, as far as mental and physical recovery goes, has never been more important to not only elite sport but everyone I bump into who struggles with their sleep hygiene,"" he tells CNN. ""They've just been getting worse and worse and suddenly so out of sync with the natural circadian process that does so much for us. Eventually you start to become somebody that's way below what you can achieve at a personal level."" Not only have we lost touch with our natural body rhythms, which for thousands of years were dictated by sunrise and sunset, Littlehales says most people have little awareness of their sleep patterns and habits. ""All the executives, all the people doing two jobs, three jobs, and trying to do a semi-amateur pro sport, they're all trying to make 28 hours out of a 24-hour cycle, putting too much pressure on it,"" he says. ""More and more athletes who've moved over to that time are moving back to taking the pressure off the nocturnal period."" Technology is also playing its part -- people in all walks of life spend more and more time with electronic devices, such as phones and tablets that stimulate the brain with artificial light, forever checking their email and social media updates. ""The phone I'm talking to you on now was simply a mobile phone when I was walking around Manchester United football club in 1998 -- it is now used for so many different things,"" Littlehales says. ""They have a counter-productive effect on a very natural process called our circadian rhythms, which has so many biological consequences in our bodies. ""What you see now is more different levels of insomnia with athletes either being not able to stay asleep for a long-enough period, or not being able to get into sleep easily enough."" The methods that he has used to help footballers at clubs such as United and Real Madrid, along with cycling champions like Bradley Wiggins, are surprisingly simple -- once you dump the widely-held sleep concepts that he says have become increasingly obsolete. For starters, forget about the convention that dictates we all need eight hours' sleep every night. Try 7.5, nine or even six. ""It's dead easy if you look at it in 90-minute cycles, which is how sleep is measured,"" Littlehales says. ""If you build a sleep routine around 90-minute cycles it gives a clear indication subconsciously -- it's not a routine you have to follow every day, but you've got something to focus on and it allows you to be flexible and it's so easy to follow."" In his case, he aims to be asleep around 11 p.m. and wake up at 6.30 a.m. --- giving himself time for a 90-minute pre-sleep routine and the same period post waking before starting work. If, say, he goes out for dinner after work and gets home later than usual, rather than scramble to get to bed at the usual time, he'll make sure he still has his 90-minute slowdown period and aim for the next sleep slot of 12.30 a.m. and still get up at the same time. Six hours' sleep might not seem enough, but this is where Littlehales turns to the habit that has died out in many Western countries -- the afternoon nap. ""We've got three natural sleep periods every day, and we need to use them,"" he says. So if you've missed out overnight, try catching up with a controlled 20-minute nap between 1-3 p.m. or 5-7 p.m. The siesta is a traditional break in many countries, especially those in hot climates, and Littlehales noticed it when he went to Spain to advise coaching staff at Real Madrid. ""Come one o'clock the place was deserted. They've got 80-odd rooms of seven-star suites at their training center,"" he says. ""Some players will go there and spend 2-3 hours like they would a siesta -- they'd have some food, have a nap. Some of them will go home and come back. ""Although it may look on the outside that they play more matches than any other club in Europe, if not the world, and they play at ridiculous times at night, but within all of their schedules there is a very strong recovery balance against activity."" Football gave Littlehales his big break in sport, becoming known as Manchester United's ""sleep coach"" in 1998 after a chance email to then manager Alex Ferguson earned him an invite to work with the club physio. By that stage, his ambitions of being the next Seve Ballesteros on the golf circuit were long gone, but he had used many of the sales and networking skills he learned as a club pro to work his way up to the board of British company Slumberland and a role as chairman of the inaugural UK Sleep Council. ""That was trying to change people's perceptions -- but it was solely driven by retailers trying to sell more beds, not from the premise of improving the way people slept. That was really the end of my road,"" he says. United had a problem with veteran England defender Gary Pallister, who was plagued by constant back pain. Littlehales suggested switching his sleeping arrangements -- it didn't cure the problem but helped Pallister's posture and subsequent rehabilitation. It led to the introduction of sleep rooms at United's Carrington training ground to allow players to cope with the demands of morning and afternoon sessions, and Littlehales went on to work with the club's Premier League rival Arsenal and the England national team. His ideas also caught the attention of British Cycling, which in 2009 was developing the nascent Team Sky pro outfit that would feature Tour de France winner and Olympic champion Wiggins. ""They were looking at recovery as a big issue and decided that my approach made a lot of sense to not only them but also the individual riders,"" says Littlehales. ""We created a sleep kit, which is a replication of the ideal layers -- pillow, duvet, linen -- all put together to allow a small group of staff to go into the hotel and unzip Bradley's bag, he sleeps in it, they zip it back up and take it to the next hotel. ""While he's traveling on a three-week grand tour, every night he would know that that stuff that's specifically focused on him for mental and physical recovery, it works, he's tried it. ""They started to build an enormous perceived value around this area, which is one of the largest chunks of their recovery period every day."" Wiggins went on to triumph at cycling's biggest race in 2012 and that same year won the Olympic time trial, while Chris Hoy -- another fan of the sleep kit -- claimed two more Games golds to become the sport's most decorated rider. It's not just athletes who need quality sleep. Rest deprivation has been shown to take its toll on physical and mental health, impacting on work performance and relationships. ""There's a lot of evidence that (sleep problems are) some of the real reasons why type two diabetes is going up quite dramatically ... weight control, depression, bipolar, anxiety, stress -- there's a lot of quite serious health issues,"" Littlehales says. ""They're finding things like breast cancer in shift-working nurses against non-shift working nurses."" So how do you fix broken sleep patterns? ""Although it's a very simple process, once focused on it you realize that you can actually be spending a lot of your valuable time wasting it trying to sleep,"" says Littlehales, who recommends the following steps. First, work out if you are an early person or a late one (""lark or owl"") and how it applies to your work situation. Next, set constant sleep and wake times using 90-minute sleep cycles. Establish 90-minute periods before sleep that reduce outside stimuli (i.e. shut down electronic devices) and bring down your body temperature -- don't exercise too strenuously at night. Make sure your bedroom is dedicated to sleep and rest. Keep the temperature cool. Wake up with the sun, or during winter with the help of machines that simulate daylight. Give yourself 90 minutes to get ready for the day ahead. Use afternoon naps to catch up on any missed sleep. Littlehales says the last of those is often difficult for foreign footballers who join English clubs, where the culture is very different to their homelands. But that is changing as high-flying Premier League teams such as Manchester City and Southampton have also taken his ideas on board. City has followed local rival United in investing in sleeping areas at its training ground, building a complex that will serve as a hotel before home games. Littlehales says attitudes towards sleep in sport have changed a lot since he started working in the area, which is being recognized as one of the remaining aspects where human performance can be improved. ""Nobody would ever put their hand up and say I can't perform in a team or do that event because I had a poor night's sleep,"" he says. ""As the years have gone by, the analysis that's available to sports science professionals has just grown and grown so they know far more about any individual athlete than they ever did before. ""The performance levels of athletes have continued to improve and increase, so the more and more that happens the human form can only go so far. ""You can keep improving equipment, nutrition and things like that, but the human being needs to develop in a much better way."" For many of us, not just sports stars, a better night's sleep is a good start.","Nick Littlehales is a sleep coach who has worked with leading sports institutions .

"For 13-year-old McClain Hermes, the inspiration to impact her world began in 2009, after her father showed her a magazine article about a shoe recycling program. ""We decided (that instead of) recycling them, we would collect them and give them to people that needed them,"" she says. And with that, Shoes for the Souls was born and delivered 365 pairs of shoes that first year. In the five years since, the Georgia teen and her father, Matt Hermes, have collected about 10,000 pairs of shoes for an Atlanta homeless shelter. But what's especially impressive about this middle school student is she does this despite the daily struggles life brings her. About the time she began collecting shoes, she developed vision problems that ended up with one of her retinas detached and her vision extremely limited in the other. She's now legally blind, and doctors say she will be completely without sight in the next two to five years. Outside the comfort of her home, she oftentimes will need to use a cane. Her family has taken several vacations to scenic destinations such as the Grand Canyon, wanting McClain to be able to experience breathtaking views while she still has a little vision left. But her disability hasn't stopped her from becoming a young dynamo. Besides Shoes for the Souls, McClain is a competitive swimmer with dreams of making the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. She wears special goggles and a special cane is used by another person so she knows when she's approaching the wall. Her shoe initiative has made her an inspiration for those much older as well. An employee off McClain's father, Ingle Chadwick-Ard, first came in contact with the Hermes family after one of her daughters was in the same Sunday school class as McClain. She doesn't mince words about her potential, saying this with a hearty laugh: ""She's going to take over the world, that kid."" But she still enjoys having fun and has found ways to work in some hijinks with her father on their project. ""The second year, my dad made an agreement with me that if we collected 1,000 pairs of shoes, which he thought was completely out of the ballpark, that I could shave his head, so 1,598 shoes later, he had a shaved head!"" But deep down, it's a very serious way to help those in crisis. And the residents at the Atlanta Mission, where McClain donates the shoes, are extremely grateful for what she does. Dennis Williams ended up at the shelter after struggling with substance abuse. Everything he wears was donated. ""Her example is an awesome example of being selfless,"" he says. McClain enjoys the appreciation she receives from the shelter residents: ""The men, a lot of them come up and give me hugs and say thank you after we're done."" Her childhood has been different from than most of her peers, but she refuses to let it be an excuse. She challenges others to go out and be of service to others. ""If you have a dream and you think it's unrealistic, just keep on doing it because you'll get there.""","McClain Hermes, 13, is legally blind but still collects thousands of shoes for less fortunate.

"One man died and dozens more were injured Friday as Israeli forces and Palestinian demonstrators clashed in Gaza and the West Bank during protests to mark Land Day, Palestinian medical sources said. Protesters hurled rocks as Israeli forces fired rubber bullets, stun grenades and tear gas at the Qalandia checkpoint, separating the West Bank from Jerusalem. Seventeen Palestinians were injured during the protest, said the head of the Ramallah medical complex, Dr. Ahmad Bitawi. He said they had suffered moderate injuries from tear gas and rubber bullets. In Gaza, one man died of his injuries, and 37 people were hurt, two of them critically, in incidents around Beit Hanoun and Khan Yunis, medical sources said. Palestinians hold Land Day rallies every year to commemorate the deaths of six demonstrators in 1976. The rallies have become an annual expression of what Palestinians consider discriminatory Israeli policies. This year, Land Day organizers have called for protests inside Israel, in the Palestinian territories, and in neighboring Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan. Rallying under the slogan of a global march to Jerusalem, protest organizers have called for ""freedom for Jerusalem and its people."" Israeli forces were placed on high alert as Palestinians and Arabs gathered to observe the day. The Qalandia checkpoint was among the chief flashpoints Friday. Mustafa Barghouti, an independent Palestinian lawmaker, said he was hit in the head and back by tear gas canisters as he and a group of peaceful protesters were making their way to the checkpoint. He is now at a hospital in Ramallah, he said. An Israeli military spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich, disputed that account, saying the Israel Defense Forces' information indicated that he was hit by another Palestinian in the Qalandia refugee camp as he sought to ""convince people to riot."" Israeli military forces sprayed foul-smelling liquid and played ear-piercing sirens as crowd-control measures. Outbreaks of violence were reported elsewhere in the West Bank and Gaza. Medical sources in Gaza said a number of Palestinians were wounded at the Erez crossing near the town of Beit Hanoun as a result of Israeli fire, most in their lower bodies. An Israel Defense Forces spokesman said troops fired at the legs of demonstrators who approached the fence and burned tires. Protesters were also injured by Israeli fire in a demonstration near the town of Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza, when they attempted to cross the security fence, Palestinian medical sources said. An Israeli security official said demonstrators had continued to approach the fence despite being told to move back. Warning shots were fired, followed by live fire when this was ignored, the official said, and one man was shot in the feet. A Palestinian protester was hit in the head by a tear gas projectile in Bethlehem and was evacuated to Hebron hospital in the West Bank in critical condition, popular committee coordinator Mahmoud Zawahreh said. Zawahreh said hundreds of Palestinians and international activists had marched toward the Bethlehem checkpoint, trying to walk to Jerusalem peacefully, when they were hit with tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades from Israeli forces. The violence flared when Palestinian youths broke from the Palestinian Authority barricades, reached the crossing that separates Bethlehem from Jerusalem and threw stones, Zawahreh said. Earlier, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces said 300 demonstrators were hurling stones and Molotov cocktails at Israeli forces in Bethlehem, without an Israeli response. Jerusalem police spokesman Shmulik Ben Rubi said several men were arrested at the Damascus Gate in the Old City for throwing stones at police. The director of the Palestinian Prisoner Association Club in Jerusalem, Naser Quos, said in a statement that 14 Palestinians, including two children, were arrested by Israeli security forces in East Jerusalem. In preparation for the Land Day protests, Israel announced a 24-hour closure of the West Bank and imposed restrictions on Friday prayers at Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque, barring men under age 40 from entering the site. Thousands of police officers are deployed across the country with an emphasis on the north of Israel and Jerusalem, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. While protest organizers said they would be peaceful, Israeli officials expressed concern that anti-Israel extremists could hijack the rallies. Israel's police chief, Yohanan Danino, urged leaders of the Arab community to ensure that extremists did not commit provocations. ""We are coordinating the marches that are to take place throughout the day with the heads of the community and hope that things will be quiet without any sporadic incidents,"" Rosenfeld said. Israeli military chief of staff Lt. Gen Benny Gantz held special security assessments Friday with regional deputies along Israel's borders in preparation for the events. The Israeli army said it would do whatever it took to protect its borders and residents. Demonstrations marking the anniversary of the Jewish state's creation turned deadly last year when clashes between pro-Palestinian activists and Israeli forces left several dead. The clashes occurred on the Israeli-Lebanese border and the frontier line separating the Golan Heights from Syria. In southern Lebanon, about 1,000 protesters, most of them Palestinian, gathered by the Crusader-built Beaufort Castle on Friday to mark Land Day. Lebanese flags flew from flagpoles, with one big Hezbollah flag above them all. ""The Arabs have finally woken, and now things will change even there,"" Muhamed Yusif Abu Shaikh, 67, said outside Sidon as he pointed south, to the border. Sabri Saidam, an adviser to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, said Land Day for the Palestinians ""is a day of mourning and a day of anger representing their eagerness to see the liberation of their land."" Palestinians are demonstrating for their children's right to live in a prosperous, independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, he said. Land Day ""is also a call for the international community to recognize the rights of the Palestinians that have long been confiscated by Israel and the need for the implementation of U.N. resolutions, otherwise the cycle of protest against the occupation will continue."" Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat said Land Day celebrates a right to freedom. ""The freedom defenders who will partake in these peaceful demonstrations and rallies around the world are marching for dignity toward Jerusalem. Together with them, Palestinians will continue their certain path toward national independence,"" he said.","Advocate says 14 Palestinians, including 2 children, arrested in East Jerusalem .

"Four people were killed and nine people were injured in clashes in Saudi Arabia, an Interior Ministry spokesman said Thursday. Two people were killed in protests, then two more died when gunfire broke out during a funeral procession, Interior Ministry spokesman Mansur al-Turki said. The fighting occurred in the Qatif region of Eastern Province, where many Shiites in the predominantly Sunni country live. Al-Turki blamed ""unknown criminal sources"" for the casualties. ""The goal of the rioters is to achieve suspicious objectives dictated to them by their masters abroad,"" al-Turki said. He did not specify to which country he was referring. There have been street disturbances in nearby Bahrain, a predominantly Shiite country ruled by a Sunni monarchy. And there has been tension between Iran, also a predominantly Shiite nation, and the Sunni world. Earlier this year, Shiite protesters in the Qatif region urged the Saudi government to release Shiite prisoners and grant more rights. Those protests, which were peaceful, also urged the withdrawal of regional forces from Bahrain. Al-Turki said Thursday's violence in Qatif ""started gradually Monday and it escalated with what happened today.""","Gunfire breaks out during a funeral procession in Saudi Arabia .

"Gleneagles, Scotland. (CNN) -- Try as it might, Team USA couldn't pull off its own miracle, having suffered the ultimate Ryder Cup indignity two years ago at Medinah in Chicago when leading 10-6 going into Sunday. Led by its talisman Rory McIlroy -- the world number one -- Europe saw off a brave challenge from those in red to retain the trophy by a ultimately comfortable margin of 16½-11½. It was the continent's third straight victory, its sixth in the last seven and one that provoked searching questions for United States captain Tom Watson, not least from his star player Phil Mickelson. But ""Lefty"" is also facing some questions after he was accused of throwing his ""captain right under the bus,"" by former European skipper Nick Faldo. Watson's European counterpart Paul McGinley will be subject to no such inquisition, universally lauded by his players and serenaded by a vibrant Scottish crowd once his triumph was rubber-stamped. Rookie triumphs . Rookie Jamie Donaldson secured the clinching point by beating Keegan Bradley, and was promptly enveloped on the 15th green by cameramen, photographers and his wife, not to mention a jubilant European team. ""I can't really put it into words,"" Donaldson, from Wales, said. ""It's unbelievable. There is nothing like it in golf. The Ryder Cup is just a total one off and it's amazing to be a part of it."" Before him Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell had overturned a three-hole deficit to topple rookie Jordan Spieth 2&1 while McIlroy's 5&4 takedown of Rickie Fowler had a brutal edge to it. ""Early in the match, the trending was exactly where we wanted it to go,"" Watson told reporters. ""We had a lot of red scored up there. The players responded early, we just couldn't keep it going. ""The bottom line is they kicked our butts. They were better players this week."" Mickelson speaks out . Watson was then forced to defend his own methods during a tense press conference after thinly veiled criticism from Mickelson, the five-time major champion, who has won on just two of his ten Ryder Cup appearances. The last of those came in 2008 and 'Lefty' praised the approach of then captain Paul Azinger, who he said had involved the players in his decision making process and formulated a ""real game plan."" Watson responded by saying: ""(Phil) has a difference of opinion. That's okay. My management philosophy is different than his. I had a different philosophy than Paul. I decided not to go that way."" Mickelson's comments drew withering criticism from former PGA Tour player and Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee, who labeled the five-timer major winner as a golfer who had ""corrupted the experience of the Ryder Cup."" Chamblee added: ""That was as close to a one-man mutiny as I ever seen."" There was no such acrimony in the European press conference, Donaldson being spirited into it on the back of Thomas Bjorn, which was punctuated by the regular sound of champagne corks popping. Asked to describe his sense of achievement, McGinley said: ""Proud is the first word. I want to say as captain it has been a real honor to get these 12 players, they have all been Colossus."" Foursomes dominance . In truth, McGinley's men had wrested the Ryder Cup decisively away from the United States on Saturday afternoon, thanks to a dominant European performance in the foursomes. And while both camps paid lip service to the miracle possibility before taking to the fairways on Sunday, there would be no second successive seismic turnaround. The jubilant air around Gleneagles confirmed that few in blue considered an upset feasible, 2010 U.S. Open champion McDowell roared off by a crowd that had been entertaining themselves in song long before the first ball had been addressed. For several hours the first tee box was the epicenter of world golf, 18-time major champion Jack Nicklaus and former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson -- the most successful manager in the history of English soccer -- both present. Unlikely prospect . And though the task was tall, the United States requiring eight-and-a-half points to pull off an unlikely victory, a few hours into the contest it led in five matches. Heeding Watson's call to ""smoke 'em early"", Spieth raced into a three-hole lead over McDowell, the 2010 U.S. Open champion from Northern Ireland. Behind him, the other standout U.S. rookie, Patrick Reed, also advanced into an early lead over Sweden's Henrik Stenson. Hunter Mahan, who succumbed in the crucial match at the climax of the 2010 Ryder Cup, birdied four of the opening six holes to seize the initiative in his clash with Justin Rose, from England. But as he had promised prior to the competition, four-time major winner McIlroy proved he was the fulcrum in Europe's engine-room. Birdie burst . Five birdies in six holes took him five clear of Rickie Fowler, and in effect, sealed the outcome of their tussle before they had even reached the ninth hole. For an hour or so, that lone sliver of blue on the leaderboard was engulfed by red. Slowly, the tide began to turn. Martin Kaymer, the reigning U.S. Open champion from Germany, took advantage of a wayward opening from Bubba Watson, the two-time Masters champion. Sergio Garcia and Ian Poulter forged ahead in the early stages of their matches, while Stenson was chewing away at the lead of Reed. But the top match was symptomatic of U.S. fortunes, as McDowell recovered from his stuttering start and stealthily set about hauling in Spieth. Trailing by three going down the tenth, the man who had been serenaded by European fans with with a chorus of ""You've got Big Mac, we've got G-Mac,"" before teeing off, found his stride. Inspired play . An inspired stretch of four birdies, acquired through a combination of formidable iron play and accurate putting, meant a symbolic switch from red to blue at the top of the leaderboard. It galvanized those behind him. Rose now roared back with four straight birdies of his own and ended with half a point against Mahan. Roars populated the course as the majority of the 40,000-strong crowd grew in energy and belief, fans glued to the big screens when there was no action to be seen in front of them. McDowell ended Spieth's challenge on the 17th, and though Reed won the last to see off Stenson, Kaymer's chip-in in front of huge crowds on 16 sealed another point. Mickelson carved out a win over home favorite Stephen Gallacher, while Matt Kuchar holed out from 160 yards on his way to a comprehensive win over Denmark's Thomas Bjorn. But further down the leaderboard, Donaldson had assumed complete control of his battle with Keegan Bradley, the 2011 U.S. PGA Champion. Crowds gathered . As it became clear the Welshman was most likely to be the one to retain the trophy, crowds scampered up to the 14th green and jostled for position as Donaldson stood over his ball. Though that one didn't drop, but glory wasn't far away. A pitch perfect iron shot on the next hole landed barely two feet from the cup and once Bradley got down to the green he conceded. Following that decisive moment, Spain's Sergio Garcia broke down on the 17th green after beating Jim Furyk, Ian Poulter and Webb Simpson halved their match, while rookie Jimmy Walker got the better of Lee Westwood to win another point for USA. It was left to Zach Johnson to strike the final blow of the 2014 Ryder Cup as he holed out to secure a half from French rookie Victor Dubuisson. With handshakes exchanged, Dubuisson was engulfed by his teammates, as a sea of champagne spray kickstarted a European party that is set to endure for another two years at least.","Europe retains the Ryder Cup .

"(CNN) -- A decade and a day might have passed but the script was still the same. If you listen to the soothsayers, the powers of Liverpool's talisman are waning. And yet, on a night where most of those in red went missing, Steven Gerrard refused to simply fade into the background. Liverpool's Champions League dream is over and perhaps, just perhaps, it is over for Gerrard too. At 34 and without a new contract having been signed, this may just yet be Gerrard's final act in this competition -- the pinnacle of European football. But if this is to be the end, then he at least went out in style, not that you'd imagine anything else of course. Trailing 1-0 to Swiss side Basel and facing elimination, Gerrard roused Liverpool one final time with a quite magnificent free kick. His curling effort flew over the wall and nestled in the top corner, a strike which will no doubt have the children in the local playgrounds attempting to replicate such a strike. That moment rekindled the memories of yesteryear and Olympiakos in 2004 where Gerrard produced one of the most iconic moments of his career. His 86th minute strike, one of the most ferocious ever unleashed by the midfielder, allowed Liverpool to progress to the last 16 after coming from behind to defeat the Greek side 3-1. That goal was the beginning of Liverpool's incredible run to the 2005 final where it defeated AC Milan on penalties after fighting back from 3-0 down at halftime. On this occasion, such heroics were to prove beyond him -- not that he should feel responsible. Far too many of those around him went missing when the club needed it most -- and when Lazar Markovic was sent off after 60 minutes, the task was always going to prove fiendishly difficult. ""I still knew after I scored that it was going to be difficult with 10 men and running out of time,"" Gerrard told ITV. ""It gave us some hope and, as the manager said, the first half was not good enough and we had to go down fighting. ""I have not seen the sending off, but I have heard it was harsh. It made it harder because we could have made it hell for Basel in the final stages with 11 men. ""I don't think we deserved better. We have not gone out because of this performance, we weren't good enough away to Basel and we let in a silly goal away to Ludogorets. ""You qualify over six games and we have not been good enough."" Liverpool's highly anticipated return to the Champions League has been nothing short of an unmitigated disaster. One victory from six games, that a last minute triumph against Bulgarian minnow Ludogorets, is a rather sad indictment of the club's campaign. The reality is that since the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and the injury to Daniel Sturridge, the club's leading forward, Liverpool have struggled. Where last season it could do little wrong, now those in red can do little right. Gone is the pace which brought defenses to its knees, the invention, the effervescence, the enjoyment which was etched across the faces of those in red. Where feet were once nimble and skipped, they are leaden and clumsy. In the Premier League, Liverpool has won six and lost six of its 15 games and is already 15 points behind leader Chelsea. Anfield on European nights is supposed to be one of the most enchanting football arenas in world football. But on this occasion, there was and is nothing magical about this Liverpool side, bar perhaps the cloak of invisibility which seemed to be wrapped up around its tactics and game plan. Basel, which defeated Liverpool in Switzerland earlier in the competition, deserved their place in the last 16 following an impressive first half performance. Fabian Frei's fine effort which flew past Simon Mignolet, the Liverpool keeper, ensured the visiting side took its advantage into the interval. A second goal almost came after the break when Taulant Xhaka's fierce drive flew just inches wide of the far post with Mignolet a mere spectator. Liverpool, having made two changes at the start of the second half, had hoped for maximum impact from its substitutes. Instead, what it got was stupidity and petulance. Markovic had only been on the field of play for 15 minutes but when he flicked his hand out towards Behrang Safari, he was immediately shown the red card. While Safari's reaction was laughable, Markovic had no defense -- it was a pathetic end to what had been an impressive 15 minute cameo. From there on Liverpool was fighting an uphill battle. And yet, as as so often been the case, one man rose to the challenge as he has done on countless occasions throughout the years. Once again, with his side laying on the canvas, he dragged his teammates to their feet with an outstanding strike. Just nine minutes of normal time remained when Liverpool was awarded a free kick some 20-yards from goal. Gerrard stood over the ball and with most of those inside Anfield holding their breath, Gerrard calmly sent the most delectable of efforts sailing over the wall and into the top corner. Then came the roar, the clenching of fists and the injection of belief which had been so sorely lacking. Suddenly there was a confidence about Liverpool as it laid siege to the Basel goal in a frantic finale. Those in the Kop end tried to suck the ball into the net as the red shirts moved forward at every opportunity. Jordan Henderson's header was saved on the line, Martin Skrtel poked wide. Gerrard roared his players forward but to no avail. The game was up. ""We have to fight going forward to be in this competition next season,"" Brendan Rodgers, the Liverpool manager, told ITV. ""We are not too far off the top four and, if we get there, we will be better in it next season. ""The possibility of January signings is something to discuss with the owners, but there was a big investment in the summer. ""We have been unlucky with injuries to key players who are important to the way that we play, but that is to take nothing away from the players tonight who have put everything into the game."" Elsewhere, Real Madrid recorded a club record 19th consecutive victory by defeating Bulgarian minnow Ludogorets 4-0. Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale were both on target for the Spanish club which progresses to the next round as the group winner. Also through to the next stage is Spanish champion Atletico Madrid which drew 0-0 with Juventus, which qualifies second in Group A. Borussia Dortmund topped Group D despite a 1-1 draw with Anderlecht, while Arsenal finished second after thrashing Galatasaray 4-1 in Istanbul. In Group C, Monaco defeated Zenit Saint Petersburg 2-0 to claim top spot, one point ahead of Bayer Leverkusen which finished second after a goalless draw away at Benfica.","Liverpool out of Champions League following draw with Basel .

"(CNN) -- American fashion designer and film director Tom Ford has revealed he received angry letters from his predecessor and rival Yves Saint-Laurent. Ford, 49, took over Yves Saint-Laurent's eponymous fashion house in 1999 when parts of it were sold to the Gucci group, where Ford was creative director. And the designer says that while the pair started as friends, the relationship soon soured -- to the point that Saint-Laurent, one of the pioneering figures in 20th Century fashion, accused Ford of ruining his reputation. Even in public comments, the Frenchman had made no secret of his disdain for Ford's taste. ""He was supportive at the beginning,"" Ford told CNN's Talk Asia. ""He loved the fact that we were buying the company, and he loved the fact that I was designing, and he had been very complimentary of my work at Gucci. ""We were quite friendly, and had dinner a few times, and my first collection, I had him up to show it to him. ""Our business was doubling and doubling and doubling, and when I started to get great press and the business started to become very successful, Yves became really quite hostile. ""I have letters that he wrote to me about it, you know: 'In 13 minutes on the runway you have destroyed 40 years of my career.' ""I am really happy I have them -- they are written in his own hand. When I'm 85, maybe I'll put them in a book -- if anyone cares."" Ford left Gucci in 2004, before setting up his own label -- Tom Ford -- something he told CNN had previously frightened him. ""I guess what I feared was that with many designers, they sell their own labels, they lose control of their labels, perhaps things are then created which then go very much against their taste level. ""Your name is a funny thing. It stands for what you're about and everything I do is really about pride. ""I don't work for money any longer. I'm fortunate enough not to need to work for money, but I work for pride, I work because I love to work, and so the idea that one could lose control of one's own name and that things could be produced with your name on that you were not proud of scared me."" The designer has also broadened his career path in recent years, moving into film with the award-winning Christopher Isherwood adaptation ""A Single Man,"" starring Colin Firth as a gay British university professor unable to cope in 1960s Los Angeles after the sudden death of his partner . Ford told CNN the shift towards Hollywood ""felt totally natural."" ""I know a lot of people in the film industry, and everyone was incredibly supportive. There's a line that people in Hollywood can 'nice you to death', so you have to take it with a grain of salt, but they were incredibly polite, incredibly supportive. ""It wasn't until after I had made my film that almost every interviewer said: 'What was it like, making a film and having it turn out as a success when everyone thought you were crazy?' ""And I thought 'People thought I was crazy? You mean people didn't actually think I could do this?' ""I had a very clear picture of what I wanted the film to be, and I'm not going to say that there weren't things that I learned and that I didn't know, but directing a film is not that dissimilar to being the creative director of a large fashion house. ""First of all, you have to have a vision; that's the most important thing. Why does anybody need to see a Tom Ford film? Why does anyone need a Tom Ford jacket? So you have to have something to say. ""Then you have to hire a great team of people to help you realize that vision, and you have to create an environment where those people can be creative, and give you their very best. ""Then you have to slowly guide carefully that team of people to help you realize your vision. So the dynamics of film directing and fashion design -- in the ways that I've done it -- were not dissimilar.""

"(CNN) -- If Republicans regain control of the Senate on Tuesday night, they will have good reason to gloat. They recruited much stronger, more sensible nominees this year -- no more candidates riding broomsticks or hurling insults at women. They also smartly accepted President Barack Obama's implicit challenge to make his record their centerpiece. But when they wake up from their celebrations, top GOP strategists such as Karl Rove will surely warn them: ""Don't over-read this election. Yes, it opens up great opportunities for the next two years, but it does not open a clear path to seizing the White House and Congress in 2016. Beware the 'blue wall!' "" Nobody has talked much about the blue wall in this year's election cycle. No reason to. Looking ahead, however, it looms increasingly as one of the most important features of America's new political terrain. It is certainly a huge boulder standing in the way of a full Republican resurgence in 2016 and giving protection to Democrats. The blue wall is a powerful phalanx of 18 states and the District of Columbia that have voted for the Democrats in every single presidential election for 20 years -- six straight. Some states have been in the Democratic column even longer. It's not just the number of blue states but how huge an advantage they provide for the Democratic presidential nominee. Altogether, these 18 states plus the District of Columbia account for 242 electoral votes -- just 28 shy of the 270 magic total required to win the White House. If the wall holds firm, the Democratic nominee only has to win a handful of purple states to go over the top. Florida's 29 electoral votes alone would seal the election. The Republicans have their own ""red wall,"" and it actually includes more states: 21 plus a major chunk of Nebraska. They are the GOP bulwark, voting consistently for the Republican presidential nominee in each of the past four presidential elections. But they tend to have much smaller populations than the Democratic states so that they account for only 179 electoral votes -- 91 shy of 270, leaving a huge hill to climb. John McCain -- a valiant candidate in 2008 -- won the red wall but nothing else. The blue wall states dominate New England (every state but New Hampshire), the mid-Atlantic, the upper Midwest, and the far West (California, Oregon and Washington). By contrast, the red wall runs through the South and up into the Plains and mountain areas. In this midterm cycle, the blue wall has proved so durable that no one has paid it much attention. Ten Senate seats are at stake in this blue territory, and Democrats look safe in nine of them; the one Republican who will win is Susan Collins of Maine, popular in part because she works across the aisle. By contrast, all of the 13 Senate races that are in play this year are outside the blue wall -- some in purple, others in red states. Mitt Romney won 10 of them, and Obama's approval ratings are in the low 40s or below in every one of them. In other words, this election has been extremely important for Republicans in the short term -- and for governing over the next two years -- but in significant ways, it is also an anomaly: a year when red and purple state Democrats who rode into office in 2008 on the coattails of a fresh, popular Obama became highly vulnerable for re-election when his coattails frayed. In 2016, the tables will turn: It is the GOP that will have the more vulnerable Senate candidates in blue and purple states. If the Democrats field a strong presidential candidate, they could well retain the White House and win a majority in the Senate, too. Then there are the demographic differences between a midterm and presidential electorate: This year's voters will be older and whiter than in 2016, favoring the GOP in an era when partisan voting trends are more divided by age and race than ever. In 2016, the pendulum swings back to the Democrats when their base -- younger, more racially diverse -- flocks to the polls. (Note: Republicans will continue to have a built-in advantage in House races until at least the next census in 2020 when new district lines will be drawn.) None of this is written in stone, of course; parties can redefine their futures if they come up with good ideas and good candidates. In Massachusetts, the bluest of the blue, the Republicans this year are likely to seize the governor's office from Democrats because they have nominated a smart, winsome candidate, Charlie Baker, seen as better in creating jobs and economic growth. Republicans looking to 2016 can also take heart because voters often sour on parties that have had the same president in the White House for two terms. Indeed, a party keeping the White House after a two-term presidency has occurred only twice in the past century -- with Franklin D. Roosevelt and after Reagan. So, it is possible that these 2014 midterms will be a turning point for Republicans, opening a way back to control of both White House and Congress in 2016. But to use a George W.

"The number of American ""patriot"" extremist groups has reached a record level, according to a new study, and experts are warning of a wave of anti-government violence. A report released Tuesday by the Southern Poverty Law Center counted 1,360 ""patriot"" extremist groups in 2012 -- up by 7% from 2011. The study defines patriot groups as anti-government militias driven by their fear that authorities will strip them of their guns and liberties. ""They believe the Constitution is being raped. With hate groups, things are going to get worse because they feel like they're in battle,"" said David Gletty a former FBI informant who spent time undercover with various militia and extremist groups. ""It's not surprising with their hatred of President (Barack) Obama that there are even more hate groups out there."" The study said California has the most patriot extremist groups, with 81. The SPLC report also offers a bit of good news: The number of ""immigrant-bashing"" extremist groups -- so-called nativism organizations -- is way down from 2011, falling by 88%. Related: Oberlin College cancels classes to address racial incidents . The new statistics come after a string of crimes linked to extremist groups. A year ago, a Michigan militia leader and his son pleaded guilty to federal gun charges. Last August, a 40-year-old ex-soldier-turned singer for a white supremacist rock band shot up a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, killing six people, before taking his own life. A few weeks later, a group of Georgia men was linked to an anti-government militia plot to assassinate Obama. Obama's election as the first African-American president and his pro-gun control stance have fueled the increase in anti-government groups, according to the report. ""We are seeing a huge reaction to the potential for gun control, and that reaction is so angry that it's hard not to be afraid of what's coming down the road,"" said Mark Potok of the SPLC. Domestic terror: Are we doing enough? The rise in such groups echoes a period almost 20 years ago, around the time when Congress passed the 1993 Brady Bill and the 1994 ban on assault weapons, the SPLC said. That legislation came near a period of infamous and deadly anti-government violence in Waco, Texas; Ruby Ridge, Idaho; and Oklahoma City, ""and led to the first wave of the patriot movement,"" the report said. Extremists, Gletty warned, ""are in a battle in their minds. Their backs are against the wall."" Skeptics . But Jesse Walker, of the Reason Foundation and author of an upcoming book, ""The United States of Paranoia: A Conspiracy Theory,""  said counting groups isn't a good way to measure the threat. ""It's dubious to assume growth in numbers is related to violence."" Also, the center's definition of hate groups has changed in the past year, kicking up a controversy. Critics accused the group of unfairly bundling together organizations with vastly different points of view -- and painting them all as potentially violent. For example a North Carolina-based group calling itself ""Granny Warriors"" appears on the SPLC list of active ""patriots."" But founder Linda Hunnicutt says her organization is harmless. ""I am deadly!"" she joked. ""I'm 74 years old. I have COPD. I have congestive heart failure. I'm sewing a quilt."" Hunnicutt acknowledges she's no friend of the federal government, but, she wishes no harm on anyone. ""All these people that want to bomb places and kill children, come on,"" she said. ""Who would be in sympathy with them?"" Hunnicutt said she and her group just want Uncle Sam to leave them alone. When Granny Warriors showed up on the SPLC list, Hunnicutt said she wasn't surprised. But it made her wonder, ""Is this all they have to do?"" Nonetheless, Hunnicutt's thankful to be on the list because she said it increases her group's notoriety. Fringe elements . Gletty said most of the fringe elements characterized in the report hate the government more than they do specific races. They hate everyone, Gletty said. Now a private investigator, Gletty spent years undercover as an FBI informant watching the internal workings of white supremacist groups. The groups named in the SPLC study came from information compiled from ""field reports, Patriot publications, the Internet, law enforcement sources and news reports."" Other highlights of the report include: . -- The state with the most neo-Nazi groups: California, with 9. -- The state with the most Ku Klux Klan groups: Texas, with 26. -- The report breaks out a group it calls ""Christian Identity,"" which the SLPC defines as ""a religion that is fundamentally racist and anti-Semitic."" Texas has the most, with five. -- Another category in the report, called ""General Hate,"" is defined as groups that are anti-gay, Holocaust deniers, racist musicians or radical traditionalist Catholics. California has the most such groups, with 37. ""The country needs to do better,"" Potok wrote in an editorial. The Department of Homeland Security, he said, needs to act to avoid a repeat of the kind of hate-based violence the nation saw in the 1990s.","74-year-old ""patriot"" group founder says her Granny Warriors are harmless .

"Acrobats, dancers and singers -- under normal circumstances, a festival featuring such tried and true attractions might not send you rushing to the Internet to book travel. But when more than 120,000 gymnasts gather in one of the world's most secretive nations to perform a highly synchronized, 90-minute spectacle of song, dance and Cold War-style propaganda, it's something worth looking into. Massive state-sponsored entertainment is a big part of the lure of North Korea's annual Arirang Festival, or ""mass games,"" and it's drawing foreign visitors in increasing numbers. The Arirang Festival began Monday at Pyongyang's May Day Stadium and will run until September 9. The festival features four mass performances each week. Its profile perhaps boosted by recent visits from Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt and professional bizarre human being Dennis Rodman, North Korea is gaining popularity as a travel destination; a record number of foreigners is expected to attend this year's festival. ""More people visiting is creating a snowball effect,"" says Troy Collings of Young Pioneer Tours, one of a handful of travel companies that organize visits to North Korea. ""Most people think they can't go. As more people do go, the more word gets around, so people suddenly start seriously considering a visit to North Korea. ""It's hard even to approximate the increase in tourists until it's all over, but our numbers are up by about 30% at this point."" According to Uri Tours, which specializes in North Korea travel, close to 1,000 Western tourists traveled to the country to attend the Arirang Festival last year. Koryo Tours, another of the few North Korea tour operators, estimates 1,200 to 1,500 international visitors will attend this year's event. ""More travelers are discovering that the people and culture of [North Korea] go beyond what is seen in the everyday media,"" says John Dantzler-Wolfe of Uri Tours. ""Through word of mouth, [travelers] are getting comfortable with the idea of going and experiencing this unique country firsthand."" What is the Arirang Festival? Arirang revolves around three primary events -- gymnastics, music and what the festival itself calls ""backdrop."" Backdrop? Sounds weird, but it's one of the most intriguing and spectacular aspects of the festival. ""Backdrop"" is supplied by tens of thousands of people in May Day Stadium working together in precision fashion. Backdrop participants are given large booklets with pages printed in different blocks of color. Held aloft in various combinations, the pages create gigantic images. When pages are flipped in concert, new images are created, making the entire stadium a sort-of human mosaic. The 90-minute, 120,000-strong extravaganza will be repeated at performances throughout the festival. An annual theme, the history of North Korea is expected to be particularly robust this year, which marks the 60th anniversary of the armistice that ended military hostility in the Korean War and the 65th anniversary of the founding of the country.","Arirang Festival began Monday at Pyongyang's May Day Stadium; runs until September 9 .

"(CNN)It's enough to make the hairs stand up on the back of your neck. A sea of yellow and gold stretches as far as the eye can see. The streets of Rome are lined with adoring football fans as the team bus winds its way towards the the Stadio Olimpico for Roma's biggest match of the season against bitter rivals Juventus with the prize of the Italian championship hanging in the balance. Inside the stadium the famous Curva Sud is alive with passion. As kick-off draws the cacophony of noise grows ever louder . ""I've been to many, many sporting events across the world,"" says Sean Foley, vice president of sport and media at the Raptor Group -- which is headed up by Roma's American owner James Pallotta. ""There's nothing I've experienced that's like Roma."" Except you're not sat in the stands. You're in your living room. You're not under night sky in the ""Eternal City,"" you're glaring into an iPad in Tokyo.  Or Buenos Aires. Or New York City. In partnership with Google, Roma is attempting to transport the match-day experience across the globe, using the latest technology and the power of social media to attract new fans from every corner of the world. ""In terms of exporting this beautiful brand, the passion of the fans and all that, it's not just a world where there's traditional media anymore,"" adds Foley, . Eager to explore new horizons, Pallotta is a man as likely to be spotted in California's tech heartlands as he is dealing with football's power brokers. And, with his blessing, it's as if Foley has been given free reign to explore football's final frontier. ""We know we're not going to win over many more fans in Italy,"" says Foley. WIf you're a Juventus fan or an AC Milan fan, that's who you are, that's what you're born into."" So back on the sofa, those iPad fans will watch a YouTube livestream following the Roma team bus as it journeys to the stadium, with drones flying above the crowd to give an altogether different perspective to viewers watching the big game. The innovations don't end there. Fans will be able to view ""shoeselfies,"" 360-degree photographs of the players' boots which will be posted prior to the 2045 CET kick off time. Roma's Google Plus page will also display a ""photosphere,"" an interactive panoramic image which allows users to further explore game night in the Italian capital. A similar project was recently conducted with French team Paris Saint-Germain. The Raptor Group's involvements in sport, technology and social media, as Foley explains, means Roma is uniquely positioned to exploit new technologies. The private investment company has interests in the Boston Celtics, Air BnB and Twitter, among others. As Foley puts it: ""I don't think there's many European football club owners that go to Silicon Valley on a regular basis. But Mr Pallotta does."" It's not the first time Roma and Google have joined forces. In May 2014, Rudi Garcia donned Google Glass for the team's friendly against Orlando while the club's iconic captain Francesco Totti has taken part in a fan chat in a Google hangout. But what's in for tech giant Google? ""When people tell you there are 3.5 billion football fans in the world, as a way to engage people on our platforms, it's certainly something for us to look at,"" says Max Goldstein, sports partnerships manager for Google. ""It's definitely an area we're taking a close look at."" No wonder Google want to wiggle their way into the hearts and minds of the football fan. A grand total of 672 million tweets were sent relating to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, while the hosts 7-1 thrashing by Germany in the semifinals saw a record 35 million tweets posted. Like Google, Twitter wants to put itself inside the stadium. Sunday's English League Cup final between Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur will see Wembley's iconic arch turn blue or white depending on which team's hashtag proves most popular. ""If you look across all social media platforms, there's a huge amount of interest in football,"" says Goldstein. ""People are going online to check football scores, follow their favorite players, follow their favorite clubs."" By bringing new tools to the table -- ""bringing people closer to the game through technology,"" as Goldstein puts it -- Google is intent on becoming an integral part of the football landscape. ""If you told any of us 10 years ago that any of this technology would exist, I think all of us would take pause,"" he responds when asked what the future could look like for Google and football. ""I'm 29 and we were still writing letters to our favorite players when we were growing up. Now people are sitting in their living rooms and talking to them directly."" It's a far cry from how football looked in the 1970s, the era that Paul Tomkins, growing up in England, was first entranced by a dominant Liverpool team. Although not from the city, Tomkins fell in love with the club in a way similar to how Roma hopes overseas fans will fall for the ""Giallorossi"" (the yellow-reds.) Tomkins has been involved with football and Liverpool as a fan, season ticket holder, journalist and author and has seen social media change how rival supporters interact with each other. And not necessarily for the better. Rather than physically clashing on the streets, he suggests fans now trade 140-character blows. ""It's about being totally neurotic about your team's result and then being totally neurotic about what everybody else is doing,"" he said. ""You see a lot of fans tweeting about their rival's demise and the whole schadenfreude thing. It's more about other people's misfortune."" With football clubs clamoring to maximize their social media presence and thus increase their corporate appeal, it's perhaps no surprise to see the odd own goal. Dunkin' Donuts is one of Liverpool's official sponsors and it recently incurred the wrath of the Twitter masses when it altered the club crest as part of a PR campaign. It replaced the phrase ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" and the two flames which feature on the badge -- both designed to honor the 96 Liverpool fans who died at the infamous Hillsborough Stadium Disaster in 1989 -- with the words ""America Runs on Dunkin'"" and two coffee cups. It has since apologized for the incident, which Tomkins suggests highlights the dangers of involving the glitzy world of PR and advertising with clubs that often have strong links to local communities with deep political convictions. ""When you look at how clubs have organically grown over the years and now they're kind of touting for new fans, you have unfortunate things,"" said Tomkins, referring to the Dunkin' Donuts gaffe. ""Replacing the Hillsborough flames with a couple of plastic cups, they don't know what that means. That's part of the failing of the new social media thing, where not everybody knows what things stand for."" Tomkins also doubts whether increasing a club's social media popularity necessarily translate into creating true football fans. ""I just don't know how much of the true club can come across on social media,"" he says. ""Everything on social media has to be bland and inoffensive."" Tomkins readily accepts that, as a traditional fan brought up in a bygone age, he's not necessarily the target audience for the latest technological innovations. But he doubts whether or not ""shoeselfies"" and drones can inspire true passion in the heart of an overseas follower. ""It's a whole new style of fan that's coming through because of the technology, because of the access. I don't know whether social media is part of gaining true fans or just gaining 'likes' on Facebook. My sense is that it's all pretty dull."" Google and Roma will be hoping that the football fans of tomorrow disagree. After all, 3.5 billion people is a lot of eyeballs.","Google and Roma partner to offer fans worldwide a digital match-day experience .

"(CNN)He spent time in prison, stole a penguin to put in his bathtub and lived in an igloo for a week. Oh and he ""died"" on a football pitch. ""It wasn't like a kaleidoscope -- there was no color, it was all black and white,"" Lutz Pfannenstiel tells CNN, recalling the moment 12 years ago when his life flashed before his eyes, the former goalkeeper suffering an injury which led the club's physio at Bradford Park Avenue to think the German was dead. It's not for nothing the title for Pfannenstiel's book is ""The Unstoppable Keeper."" Even now, the memory of that day in Bradford, Yorkshire, in north England, is still vivid. ""There were black and white diamonds and it was very quiet,"" said Pfannenstiel, whose lungs collapsed after an opposition player's knee smashed into his chest, preventing him from breathing. ""In the background there were figures but I couldn't make out who they were. I didn't feel cold, I felt all warm. I felt I was floating and it wasn't a scary feeling at all."" After waking up from the accident and finding himself in hospital, Pfannenstiel screamed at the nurses, convinced he was paralyzed. Raging at the abandonment of the game, in which his team was leading, he was back training within a week. Looking back, he says he behaved ""irresponsibly"" and the incident proved a turning point in Pfannenstiel's career, in which he played for 25 clubs across the globe over two decades. As a youngster, Pfannenstiel was a highly rated player and represented Germany's youth team at Under-17 level. Despite the nation's biggest club Bayern Munich making him an offer, Pfannenstiel opted to pursue his dream of playing abroad. So in 1993 he left Germany to play in Malaysia with Penang FA before eventually moving to England where he enjoyed time in the Premier League with Wimbledon and Nottingham Forest. In South Africa, Pfannenstiel became a folk hero with Orlando Pirates in Johannesburg, his fame even persuading one would be gun toting assailant to apologize for inconveniencing the German as he visited the corner shop for a bottle of water. But it was in Singapore where the most traumatic episode of Pfannenstiel's career would take place after he was accused of conspiring with bookmakers. At the time the German was enjoying life, modeling for Armani and presenting his football highlights show, but he was then found guilty of match fixing and sentenced to 101 days in prison. Protesting his innocence, Pfannenstiel  says he was not charged for match fixing, but for a verbal corrupt agreement. What followed was ""one of the most difficult times"" of his life  as he adjusted to being surrounded by murderers, drug dealers and rapists. ""The prison had no bed, no toilet, no toilet paper, no toothbrush. I slept on the floor,"" he said. ""People were on death row. People got hung. ""For breakfast, they don't say good morning, they punch you in the face. I had to survive in that circus. If it was for 101 days, it felt like 25 years."" Jail time and his near death experience in England brought about Pfannenstiel's Damascene conversion. Keen to distance himself from what he perceived was a superficial and materialistic way of life, Pfannenstiel came up with  the idea of 'Global United' -- a charity to raise awareness of climate change. It's a project that has prompted Pfannenstiel to invoke the help of several famous footballers such as Zico, Lothar Matthäus and Jari Litmanen. The charity has already run successful events in Africa, particularly Namibia, tackling issues such as HIV/AIDS, famine and education. Now Pfannenstiel hopes to take his football friends, who play in games to raise money, to Antarctica and bring attention to the effects of climate change. He hopes to hold the match at the end of 2015 or early 2016 when the weather is slightly more convivial and use the airport on King George Island as the venue as to ensure the local habitat isn't adversely affected. ""I want to leave the scene as if nothing had ever happened,"" says Pfannenstiel. ""We will clear the airfield using the snowmobiles, use yellow tape for the lines and we will build the nets. ""Within 10 minutes, the nets and lines are gone and nothing will be left. ""I don't want to hear 'this idiot is going there' and he destroyed the natural habitat. There are lots of plants growing around the area and it's very important. ""We will have scientists advising us and if they say we can play elsewhere, fair enough but at the moment, the airfield is the most convenient."" Having grown up in the Bavarian forests of Germany, Pfannenstiel has always been passionate about the environment. Nature fascinates him and the tranquility and cleanliness of country life remains an integral part of his life. ""If you stand there, you can see the real Antarctica but at the same time, when you look out, you can also see what has happened,"" he says. ""It is already getting greener and that really shouldn't happen. ""Playing in Antarctica makes people think you're playing in the snow and in front of mountains and that's how it was 50 years ago. ""Now it's not like that. The highlands are still white, snowy and icy but the airfield where we will play, is green, brownish and dirty."" Pfannenstiel has already helped raise awareness of the effects of the climate change by spending a week living in an igloo -- a feat which was streamed online. He hopes to visit the Amazon later this year and spend time living in the treetops in a bid to bring awareness to the destruction being wrought upon the world's rainforests. ""I was born in a village, which is now a ski resort, but it was always beautiful and clean,"" he recalled. ""Whenever I go back to visit my father, everything is so natural. ""When I started to travel, my brain began to scan things and it would compare places like London or any big city to where I grew up. It's filthy. ""If you go to China, the idea of climate change doesn't even seem to register on the conscience. ""If you go to the Maldives, you know that they will be gone in 10-15 years because they'll sink. ""It's a real issue which we want to tackle."" It's not just the environment which Pfannenstiel is passionate about -- he loves animals too. During his time in Singapore, he owned a pet monkey which caused untold trouble in his apartment. In New Zealand, he had another pet, although one which nearly led to him being deported. Otago, famous for its penguins, became a place of some fascination for Pfannenstiel, who held a long-term admiration for the animal. One night under the cover of darkness, he pulled on a wet suit and temporarily borrowed a penguin to take home with him. ""I saw this penguin and I got so curious and I just adopted him as a pet,"" laughs Pfannenstiel. ""They told me I couldn't do that. So a few days later, I went and got one out. ""I brought him back and put him in a cold bath but he wasn't happy and he really did stink of fish. ""The president of the club came for lunch and he saw that I had the penguin. ""He said it was dangerous and that I could have been deported for having the penguin in the bathtub."" When not kidnapping penguins or looking to save the world, Pfannenstiel spends his time working for German football Bundesliga club 1899 Hoffenheim. As head of scouting and international relations, he scours the planet looking for talented players which he can bring to the Bundesliga club. He is a football analyst on German television while he has also become more of a feature on the television screens in the United Kingdom. He also works with world governing body FIFA and for the German Football Association as a coaching instructor focusing on educating coaches all over the world. ""I've had to fight for everything since leaving prison,"" he said.  ""When I came back it cost me a fortune. I didn't have that much money -- all I had was a pair of flip flops, a pair of shorts, a T-shirt and a bag full of debts. ""But I can't complain -- at least I'm not dead.""","Lutz Pfannenstiel is a former goalkeeper .

"(CNN) -- Humans have driven to extinction four marine mammal species in modern times: StellerÂ´s sea cow in 1768, the Caribbean monk seal in 1952, the Japanese sea lion in 1970 and the baiji or Chinese river dolphin in 2006. As you read this, we are on the brink of losing the fifth. The vaquita (Spanish for ""little cow""), a small porpoise that lives only in the uppermost Gulf of California, Mexico, is the most endangered of the 128 marine mammals alive today. The vaquita, which some say looks endearing with its unique facial markings, is the smallest of all whales, dolphins and porpoises. The only way to prevent its extinction is if the Mexican, U.S. and Chinese governments take immediate and coordinated action. New evidence presented by a team of international scientists, established by the government of Mexico, shows that the vaquita is running out of time even faster than we thought. â€ŽThe population is very small and disappearing rapidly, with more than half lost in just the last three years. There were about 200 vaquitas a few years ago, and now a report presented recently to the Mexican government by an international recovery team estimated that fewer than 100 remain. Each year, about one in five vaquitas is drowned in fishing nets, both legal and illegal. This makes it likely that at least another 20% of the population will be lost during the next fishing season, shrinking the total number even more. In light of this alarming decline, the international team has called for an emergency regulation establishing a gillnet exclusion zone for the entire range of the vaquita starting in September. The vaquita's fate has also long been tied to the totoaba, a large fish that lives in the upper Gulf of California as well. Entanglement in gillnets set for totoaba was the primary cause that brought the vaquita to low levels by the mid-1970s. Totoaba were overfished by the mid-1970s, and the species was listed as endangered by Mexico in 1975, and by the United States in 1979. Massive illegal fishing of the totoaba has resurged in the past three years because its swim bladder is used as a very expensive traditional health food in China, especially in Guangdong and Hong Kong. Dealers along the isolated beaches of San Felipe and El Golfo de Santa Clara, two small fishing towns close to the U.S. border, buy swim bladders from fishermen by paying several thousand dollars per kilogram. Thousands of swim bladders are likely then smuggled across the border to the United States and shipped to China -- where a kilogram can be reportedly worth much more on the black market -- leaving thousands of dead totoabas and tens of drowned vaquitas to rot. Mexican authorities have acted to prevent the extinction of the vaquita. Over the past five years, the Mexican government, together with national and international foundations, has allocated more than $30 million to save this porpoise and support the livelihoods of the local fishing communities. Most of this money has been used to compensate the fishermen affected by the creation of a vaquita refuge in 2009 and to assist those wanting to switch to safer fishing techniques. In February 2013, the Mexican government established a committee to advise President Enrique Pena Nieto on urgent measures to save the vaquita, led by Mexico's secretary of the environment. Four months later, in a bold move, the government mandated the elimination of all shrimp gillnets -- in which vaquitas are caught -- through their gradual replacement with a newly developed safer net within three years. But more needs to be done. Despite these measures, the vaquita will be lost unless the illegal totoaba fishing is stopped immediately. It is now or never, and only high-level action can save this critically endangered porpoise. We urge Pena Nieto to stop the illegal fishing of totoaba by even stronger enforcement of the gillnet ban and to extend the refuge boundaries to cover the entire vaquita habitat. This means eliminating all gillnet fisheries within the expanded refuge and compensating the fishermen, while allowing for a transition toward new gear that catches shrimp but not vaquitas. We also urge U.S. President Barack Obama to take swift and decisive action through the newly created White House Wildlife Trafficking Group. The first immediate step is to scale up the already significant law enforcement efforts on transborder shipments of totoaba products. Finally, we urge China Premier Li Keqiang to immediately stop the illegal entrance of totoaba products. It is still possible to save the vaquita, but this is clearly the last chance. We call upon the governments of the United States, China and Mexico to take swift action to save this unique and beautiful species for present and future generations.","The vaquita, a small porpoise that lives in Gulf of California, Mexico, is near extinction .

"""Here comes the sun"" indeed, and it was just barely all right. Two years ago, modern infrastructure came very close to a serious disruption. The culprit? One of the largest solar storms in recorded history. Plasma exploding from the surface of the sun in a coronal mass ejection barreled through space and crossed through Earth's orbital path on July 23, 2012. If the flare had erupted about one week earlier, Earth would have been squarely in the line of fire, Daniel N. Baker wrote in a study published in the journal Space Weather. (Baker is with the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado). This is not the first time solar activity has threatened Earth. A massive solar storm in 1859, dubbed the Carrington Event after the English astronomer who witnessed it, caused the northern lights to appear as far south as Cuba; and it caused telegraph lines to spark, setting fire to a number of buildings, according to Science@NASA editor Dr. Tony Phillips. ""According to data from the STEREO-A spacecraft (a solar observatory), the solar storm of July 23, 2012, was every bit as potent as the Carrington storms,"" he said. Baker said that had our planet been in the path of the storm, it would not be inconceivable that we would still be ""picking up the pieces."" Phillips agrees. ""As society relies more and more on high technology such as GPS, the Internet, satellite communications and smart power grids, we also expose ourselves more and more to the dangers of stormy space weather."" He added that power outages after the storm could have persisted for many months.  If the solar storm had hit, much of Earth's technology would be rendered inoperable: from radios and GPS systems to toilets. Though human beings would not be physically harmed directly, a study by the National Academy of Sciences estimates that damage from a coronal mass ejection of similar magnitude could exceed $2 trillion in the United States and pose risks to national security. While Earth did get lucky in 2012, humans should not get too comfortable. Despite the relatively mild conditions on the sun, solar storms are unpredictable. According to Baker, ""incredibly powerful"" space weather is possible at any time. Space weather: Fine, with a chance of solar flares . NASA cameras capture huge solar flares .

"(CNN)It's a thriller that reads like a script from one of those Scandinavian dramas that have entranced global television audiences in recent years. A 16-year-old Norwegian soccer sensation -- Martin Odegaard -- is set for superstardom after being headhunted by Spanish giants Real Madrid. Much is expected of Odegaard, with pretty much every European elite football club rumored to have expressed an interest in securing his signature. But will Odegaard's tale have a happy ending? Spanish giants Real Madrid are hoping so after swooping in for the kill. ""It's an honor and a dream come true,"" Odegaard told the Real website as he was unveiled by the Spanish club alongside one of the Real greats Emilio Butragueno, who labeled the Norwegian as ""an extraordinary talent."" ""The reason I chose Real Madrid is because this team has the best conditions, both in sporting terms to develop as a player, and off the field to develop as a person,"" added Odegaard. While his tender age means he will initially enter Real Madrid's B team -- coached by French great Zinedine Zidane -- it might not be too long before he's wowing the crowd at the Spanish club's Bernabeu stadium. ""Plan: Debut this season,"" trumpeted Norway's largest daily newspaper VG's headline. Odegaard's success in Norway has snowballed quickly, with the Nordic nation gripped by his meteoric rise. ""Norway is hit by a serious, serious Odegaard-fever,"" Norwegian News Agency's Espen Hartvig told CNN. ""I would say that in general for the moment it is a kind of pride that little Norway and little Drammen (Odegaard's home city) has produced a football talent like this."" The fresh-faced forward, who has spent his entire career to date with Stromsgodset, debuted for Norway last year, becoming the youngest player to appear in a European Championship qualifier aged just 15 years and 300 days old. ""My goal is to become the best player possible,"" said Odegaard. ""It isn't important if I play in the first or second team. ""It's a major advantage having a second team of a really high level and with a coach who was one of the best players in the world, and it was also important in my decision,"" added the Norwegian teenager, referring to Zidane. Only time will tell -- and Odegaard has a lot of it on his side.","16-year-old Martin Odegaard has been snapped up by Real Madrid .

"The drug called Molly isn't what most of its users think it is. If you Google ""Molly,"" many articles say the drug is ""pure"" MDMA, the active ingredient in Ecstasy. Users often talk about the ""purity"" of taking Molly, as if it's somehow better; after all, MDMA was originally developed as a medication to treat depression. But today's Molly is most often not MDMA -- in the last few years, the drug has become a toxic mixture of lab-created chemicals, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Here are nine things everyone should know about this rapidly changing party drug: . 1. What is Molly? Someone who buys or takes Molly now is probably ingesting dangerous synthetic drugs that have not been tested and are produced in widely varying strengths. The DEA says only 13% of the Molly seized in New York state the last four years actually contained any MDMA, and even then it often was mixed with other drugs. The drugs frequently found in Molly are Methylone, MDPV, 4-MEC, 4-MMC, Pentedrone and MePP. 2. What does Molly do? The lab-created chemicals mimic the effects of MDMA; most of them are central nervous system stimulants that cause euphoric highs. They can also cause a rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure, blood vessel constriction and sweating, and can prevent the body from regulating temperature. Some of the chemicals have been reported to cause intense, prolonged panic attacks, psychosis and seizures. After they wear off, the chemicals can cause devastating depression. Several of these compounds have caused deaths. 3. Who is using Molly? Molly is being marketed to young first-time drug abusers between the ages of 12 and 17, as well as traditional rave, electronic dance music fans who may think they're getting MDMA. ""Our kids are being used as guinea pigs by drug traffickers,"" says Al Santos, associate deputy administrator for the DEA. 4. What does Molly look like? Molly can take many different forms, although it's most often found in a capsule or powder. The DEA has also seen Molly applied to blotting paper, like LSD, and in injectable form. 5. What makes Molly so dangerous? Molly is dangerous because of the toxic mix of unknown chemicals; users have no idea what they're taking or at what dose. Unlike MDMA and other illegal drugs that have known effects on the body, the formulas for these synthetic drugs keep changing, and they're manufactured with no regard to how they affect the user. ""You're playing Russian roulette if you take these compounds because we're seeing significant batch-to-batch variances,"" Santos says. For example, officials have found completely different ingredients in drugs sold in the same packaging.  Santos also says the amount of active ingredients can be dangerously different, because ""the dosing for these sorts of drugs are in the micrograms. The room for error is tremendous, and we've seen a lot of deaths with some of these compounds."" The DEA has developed its own reference materials for state and local law enforcement because they were encountering so many different drug compounds they'd never seen before. At the DEA testing lab, technicians are constantly trying to unravel the chemical makeup of newly discovered drug compounds that have been seized. What you need to know about synthetic drugs . 6. Where do the chemicals come from? Almost all the chemicals in Molly and other synthetic drugs come from laboratories in China. Chinese chemists sell the drugs online, and middlemen in the United States and around the world cut it with other substances, and either place it in capsules or sell it as powder. Other kinds of synthetic drugs can be sprayed onto plant material and smoked, such as synthetic marijuana. But it's difficult for law enforcement to keep track of all the chemicals. The DEA says it's seen about 200 individual chemical compounds since 2009 and 80 new compounds since 2012. As soon as a compound is discovered and banned, another one is created to take its place. Interestingly enough, the formulas for these drugs were discovered by legitimate scientists working on new medications. The formulas couldn't be used as medicine because of the stimulant or hallucinogenic effects they had users, but the ""recipes"" for the drugs still remain. Clandestine chemists have used the scientific literature to create hundreds of new chemical compounds for the sole purpose of getting people high. There is no known legitimate purpose for any of these chemicals. Music festival canceled after 2 deaths blamed on drugs . 7. How widespread is the problem? Huge. The fastest-emerging drug problem in the United States is the synthetic drug market, which now includes Molly. The chemicals in Molly have been found in nearly every state in the U.S. And it's a multibillion-dollar business. In two days, the DEA seized $95 million off drug traffickers during a crackdown. It is a growing problem in Australia, New Zealand and Europe as well. 8.  What's being done about it?  Why can't the government just make it illegal? Congress passed the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act in July 2012, which controlled 26 compounds by name. But there are hundreds of compounds, and every time the government makes one illegal, chemists alter the formula slightly to make it a substance that is no longer controlled. U.S. officials say they are discussing the issue with the Chinese government, but most of these chemicals are legal in China. There's something (potentially dangerous) about molly . 9. How can I tell if someone is using or has used Molly? The effects can vary widely, depending on the chemical, but while users are under the influence, they may exhibit the following symptoms: sweating, jaw clenching, violent or bizarre behavior and psychosis. After the drug has worn off, a user may show signs of depression or may not be able to get out of bed for an extended period of time.","Molly is a drug that used to be the powder or crystal form of MDMA, or Ecstasy .

"It's a staggering statistic: 43 college students from the same school, all hoping to become teachers someday -- all missing and feared dead. Their disappearance became a flashpoint for national protests. Mexico's President met their parents. The Pope sent them prayers. Mexico's attorney general says they were captured by police on the orders of the Iguala mayor, Jose Luis Abarca, handed over to a drug gang and executed. Authorities say they believe the students' burned remains were thrown into a river, but many family members say they're still holding out hope until there's DNA proof. On Friday, prosecutors said they had charged Abarca with six counts of aggravated homicide and one count of attempted homicide in the deaths. Abarca and his wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda, were arrested in Mexico City on November 4. As the controversial case grabs global headlines, the students' families and classmates march in demonstrations -- carrying large photos of their faces, sharing their stories and demanding justice. ""Our children are not criminals. They are people who were just starting to study for their careers. They wanted to help others,"" says Epifanio Álvarez, whose son is among the missing. Here's a closer look at some of the students' stories: . Jorge Aníbal Cruz Mendoza, 19 . Carmelita Cruz cries as she describes her youngest son. ""He has always told me that I am everything to him, and as my youngest son, I also told him, 'Son, you are everything to me,'"" she says. Once, during a family pillow fight, her other children complained that she was fighting too much on his side. Now, Cruz is fighting to demand answers from authorities over her 19-year-old son's fate. Even before the September night of shootouts in Iguala, Mexico -- which left several students dead and the group of 43 missing -- she'd been worried about his safety studying at Escuela Normal Rural de Ayotzinapa. The teachers' college in Guerrero state is known for its political activism in addition to training teachers, and police have been known to spar with student protesters in the past. She'd hoped he'd study at one of Mexico's large public universities. But Jorge made up his mind: He wanted to study at Ayotzinapa. ""He wanted to be here. His dream was to study in this school to help poor people,"" Cruz told CNN en Español's Fernando del Rincon in a recent interview. When investigators first started looking into the students' disappearance, some suggested they could have been mixed up in gangs. Not true, Cruz says. ""I think the government is guilty. But obviously they want to wash their hands and blame those who are not responsible,"" she says. ""In this case, my son is so young. I know him. He does not know how to use a weapon. ... He doesn't even know how to use a knife. And I think that's true of all 43 of the young people. If they had weapons, they would have defended themselves."" José Ángel ""Pepe"" Navarrete, 18 . Pepe went to the well-known teachers' college with a clear goal, his father says: working with marginalized communities. It's a common aim of many at the small, government-funded school, which gives the students it trains the opportunity to work in some of the poorest and most remote communities in Guerrero. His father -- like many parents of the missing students -- says he believes they are still alive. And he says he has a message for his son's captors, whomever they may be. The 43 students, Emiliano Navarrete says, ""are kind, defenseless young people who shouldn't have to pay for the crimes of adults."" Whoever took the students, he says, must be human beings, too. ""They also have children, and they wouldn't like the same thing to happen to them."" Inside a barren dorm room, one of Pepe's roommates told animalpolitico.com that he loved soccer. ""That's why he got along well with everybody,"" his roommate said. ""He knew how to relax."" Israel Jacinto Lugardo, 19 . There's one thing Isrrael Galindo knows for sure about the night his son went missing. The 19-year-old student had contacted his older brother and asked for help. ""He told him, 'Hurry, because the police have taken us. They used tear gas,'"" Galindo told CNN en Español's Jaqueline Hurtado. From his home in San Jose, California, the construction worker said he believes his son is still alive, despite what government officials claim. He describes his son as playful, calm and hard-working. As a child, Galindo showed him how to repair bicycles, cars and farm machinery. ""He learned fast and could do anything,"" Galindo told the San Jose Mercury News. Back in Mexico's Guerrero state, where the students disappeared, the teen's mother has marched in demonstrations, carrying a large photo of her missing son. ""He is a good boy. He came here very excited to study,"" she told Mexico's animalpolitico.com website. ""But we did not expect that something like this would happen. I demand that the government do something."" Julio César López Patolzin, 25 . In a spiral-bound notebook that still sits in his dorm room, Julio César pulled out a pencil and documented his first days at the college. ""I entered this school for the simple reason that my parents are peasants with few resources and my ability is to be responsible also academically,"" he wrote, according to a photograph of the August 27 entry that appeared in Mexico's Proceso magazine. ""I try to pay close attention to the teachers in order to get ahead."" Less than a month later, he disappeared. Now there is just one student left living on that floor of the dorm, Proceso reported. Julio César and five others who lived there are among the 43 missing. Inside the dorm, a plastic cup and toothbrush are still sitting on Julio César's duffle bag. The last student left living there told Proceso that he won't leave, because he's waiting for his classmates to come back. Miguel Ángel Mendoza Zacarias, 23 . Most of Miguel Ángel's classmates are younger than he is. That's because he had another job as a barber before he started at the teachers' college. ""He cut hair and that's how he got ahead,"" his best friend told animalpolitico.com. ""He didn't start studying sooner because he didn't have money. And he decided it was better to help his parents with his business, and to work in the fields."" At the teachers' college, his friend said he was known for being supportive and giving good advice. On September 26, they were sitting side by side on a bus when violence broke out in Iguala. ""He ran one way, and I ran the other. I got on a bus and the police in Iguala arrested him. I managed to escape,"" the friend told animalpolitico.com. ""But since then, I've been searching for him."" Antonio Santana Maestro . Antonio recently started playing guitar and loved spending hours playing video games, his friends told animalpolitico.com. But what he enjoyed more than anything was reading, his friends said. Classmates nicknamed him ""Copy,"" because he was so good at recalling information and parroting it back. Antonio was among the students in the school's so-called Activist House, a political education program students can volunteer to join. ""In our political workshops, he always expressed himself so eloquently,"" one friend told the website. ""He is a very smart person who knows everything about everything you ask him. ... In one workshop, he spent 10 minutes speaking on subjects that no one has a command of. And he just made a remarkable speech out of what he had heard and read."" Jorge Álvarez Nava, 19 . At first, it was hard for Jorge to adjust to his freshman year. But things were looking up, his father says. Jorge turned 19 on a Tuesday in September. He called his parents the next day. ""He told us that he was happy, that the most difficult things were over,"" Epifanio Álvarez recalls. By Saturday, Jorge had vanished without a trace -- one of the 43 students who disappeared. ""In the morning, I went to work in the fields,"" said Álvarez, a peasant farmer. ""When I came home, my wife found me and told me something horrible had happened in Iguala."" Since then, Álvarez says he hasn't stopped searching for his son -- and he won't, until he finds him. But even as he pushes to keep looking, Jorge's father says he finds himself filled with despair when he's at home and sees his son's belongings . ""We saw his guitar. Really, seeing his things there, you start to cry, overcome by the feeling that he isn't there,"" Álvarez says, tearing up as he described his son's love for music. ""We wonder, what is happening to him? And we don't know.""","Former mayor charged with homicide in deaths of college students .

"(CNN) -- Even terrorists have fears. And the prospect of gender equality appears to rank high on their list of worst nightmares. The logic, for them, is simple. Empowered women would never accept the brutal ideology espoused by terrorist leaders as the rule of their land. Educated women and girls would fundamentally challenge the power structure of organizations like ISIS. Therefore, if you carry out the argument, they must be suppressed and enslaved. ""There is no doubt that targeting of women is the core element -- not a byproduct -- of the ideologies espoused by these groups,"" Sanam Naraghi-Anderlini, co-founder of the International Civil Society Action Network, told us. So, any successful strategy against these groups must put women's rights at the front and center of policy planning. This will require more than words or a few million dollars allocated to girls' schools. It will demand a fundamental shake-up of America's foreign policy paradigm, on everything from aid to alliances. It will demand engaging women on the ground -- the women who are currently battling the nefarious organizations that are stripping them of their humanity. Does any group or state that refuses to commit to working toward gender equality merit our money, weapons or political capital? Any entity that refuses to treat at least half of its population as equal to the other cannot be expected to protect minorities and promote tolerance. In other words, the perpetuation of female oppression works against U.S. interests and therefore should be a disqualification for U.S. investment. After all, part of the reason America ostensibly invests and offers aid is to help nations to move closer to more inclusive and tolerant governance. The merits of building a foreign policy around the protection and empowerment of women and girls should be obvious from our own experience: Progress on gender equality has been central to our own accession to true democracy (though we still have a long way to go on the gender parity front). It will similarly be key in any efforts to salvage areas that have become cesspools for extremist ideology. It is not a coincidence, after all, that some of the countries where women's rights fare the worst also produce many jihadists for al Qaeda and the Islamic State. And in many of those countries, women's rights aren't just stagnating, they're backsliding. ""Although the battle over traditional gender roles is not new, the rise of religious extremism is ... halting and sometimes reversing the recent progress made on women's rights and pushing women out of the public sphere,"" according to an ICAN policy brief from spring 2014, which cites Tunisia, Algeria, Libya, Yemen and Egypt as prime examples of the trend. The World Economic Forum's 2014 Global Gender Gap Report backs up that assertion. The index ranks countries by performance in reducing the disparity in treatment and access between women and men. Consistently, some of the worst ranked countries on the economic empowerment index -- and on the overall index -- (Tunisia, Egypt, Turkey, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iran, Jordan, Somalia, Pakistan and Syria) are also countries where extremism is on the rise and has in some cases already taken over the reins of power. ""In parts of Syria, Iraq, and the Sinai, extremist groups have a greater impact on conditions on ground, and freedoms that people do or don't enjoy, than the government does,"" says Vanessa Tucker, vice president for analysis at Freedom House. The question remains: Why do these groups target women? It all comes down to asserting control. Often times, extremist groups are catering to disillusioned young men who, because of their unstable life circumstances, have been unable to marry, secure a job, provide for a family and thus assert their masculinity in traditional ways. Hence, ""the control over and subservience of women is part of the messaging and ideology that seems to resonate well"" when recruiting men, Naraghi-Anderlini says. One of the first steps to domination is the control of information. Just as the Nazis were obsessed with burning books and exterminating any free-thinking group whose mere existence might be incompatible with its one-party fanaticism, Islamist extremists are committed to shutting down any institution that allows for women's education. In Afghanistan, schoolgirls as young as 7 or 8 years of age have been threatened and shot by the Taliban for going to school. In Nigeria, hundreds of women were abducted from their schools earlier this year. Perhaps the most famous example is Nobel Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani girl who was the subject of an elaborate assassination plot as the Taliban chose to make an example of her to instill fear into other activists for girls' education. Despite being shot in the head when her school bus was ambushed in 2012, she survived. More recently, in the Yazidi and Kurdish parts of Iraq that fell to Islamic State fighters, young women have been enslaved, and many now live the most tortured lives imaginable. On a recent BBC World Service segment, we heard about a phone call that a Kurdish fighter received recently from an enslaved Yazidi woman. ""If you know where we are please bomb us,"" said the crying woman, who was living in a brothel. ""There is no life after this. I'm going to kill myself anyway -- others have killed themselves this morning. I've been raped 30 times and it's not even lunchtime. I can't go to the toilet. Please bomb us."" The money that funded the rise of ISIS and other terrorist organizations came from countries that we now claim are allies, but which embrace religious ideologies that are similar in theory, if not always as openly brutal in practice (or at least on YouTube videos) as ISIS. Wahhabi and Salafi ideologies on the Sunni side, and the Iranian Ayatollahs' own brand of systematic suppression of female liberties, all prevail in the states that gave birth to extremist groups. It is hardly encouraging, in this context, to hear President Erdogan of Turkey recently proclaim that women would never be equal to men -- this, right as the United Nations was gearing up for a 16-day campaign to bring awareness to violence against women worldwide (the United Nations estimates that a full third of women across the globe experienced acts of violence directed at their gender). By aiding states that were actively supporting groups that merged with ISIS, the United States seems to have favored the short-term alignment of interests over the long-term alignment of principles. Making progress on women's rights should be a criterion for our aid and protection. The linkage between aid and progress is not new. World Bank loans, for example, are already contingent on commitments to economic reform. And the Millennium Challenge Corporation, an independent U.S. foreign aid agency which is central in its role of setting policy, doles out aid based on various policy indicators, including civil liberties, child health and even girls' primary education completion. But a stronger emphasis on progress towards gender equality would help clarify the importance this issue holds for the United States, and perhaps inspire other global institutions to make gender equality a priority. At this critical time, it is vital that we react with clarity to the rise in brutality towards half of humanity. We must realize that only a policy that puts our money where our mouth is on the question of gender equality will effectively promote tolerance and stability.

"It took Superman until his teenage years to discover his superpowers, but many of us take much longer to find our own, if we ever do at all. Yet identifying a superpower -- that core strength that gives an edge in the workplace, be it creativity, vision or an analytical mind -- can be the key to taking a career to the next level. ""I am a full believer that the first thing you do in a leadership role is to identify your own strengths and play to them,"" says Sheryl G Feinstein, co-author of ""The Brain and Strengths Based School Leadership."" ""I think too often one of the difficulties leaders have is they try to be everything to everyone, which creates kind of a patchwork of leadership which is counterproductive,"" she adds. ""They spend so much of their time overcompensating for their weaknesses that they don't really play to their strengths."" Research suggests that leaders who identify their core strengths, and play to them, are more satisfied in their work and better paid, she says. Read more: Is your boss a psycho?

Identifying it could help you sell yourself within your organization -- and to others. But how do you identify your superpower? While a little self-knowledge can go a long way, it is common for executives to be in the dark as to their own strengths and weaknesses. ""It's very difficult to be objective about your own strengths,"" says Mills. ""Most people have a particular strength, but quite often because it's something they enjoy doing, perhaps more of a natural ability, it feels easy and therefore they think everyone can do it."" A good way to find out is to ask ex-colleagues or ex-managers ""whose opinion you trust and who will be honest,"" she says. ""They will give you objective feedback, and the things you often take for granted, other people will see very clearly.""

It's amazing with these computerized programs how they often just end up validating things that deep down people already know about themselves."" Sean McPheat, managing director of MTD Training, says the old conventional wisdom about strengths and vulnerabilities no longer applies. ""People used to say 'Work on your strengths, develop your weaknesses.' But forget developing your weaknesses. A 2% improvement in your strengths is going to be better than a 2% improvement in your weaknesses."" Longshaw adds: ""That's not to say ignore your weaknesses -- know what they are, but time and effort trying to get better at your weaknesses is far less well spent."" Rather than spending too much time trying to overcome your failings, the best way to shore up up your weaknesses could be to assemble a team of people with the attributes you lack. ""Perhaps you have strengths in organization but are weaker when it comes to vision, to building relationships,"" says Feinstein. ""With the right balance, you can play to your own strengths and let your team play to theirs.""","Knowing your strengths -- and playing to them -- is the key to effective leadership .

"Every gang needs a leader. And what has become undeniably clear in recent days is that the de facto leader of the Gang of Eight is Marco Rubio. The Florida lawmaker, and potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, appeared on seven Sunday talk shows, discussing -- in English and Spanish -- the specifics of a comprehensive immigration reform bill that he hammered out with three other Senate Republicans and four Senate Democrats. The legislation is expected to be formally unveiled on Tuesday. This means that, by Wednesday, just about everyone will be angry. Conservatives will declare the provisions of the bill too lenient, while Hispanics will condemn them as too punitive. Welcome to the immigration debate. That Rubio is at center stage in all this is no surprise. He was always going to figure prominently in efforts to revamp the country's archaic immigration system. This isn't because of what you hear from the Washington press corps, which is constantly showcasing how little it knows about the immigration debate. Rubio casts a long shadow on this issue not because he is a conduit between the Republican Party establishment and the tea party. Rubio's relationship with that band of activists went on the rocks last year when he warned Republicans that their rhetoric on immigration was too harsh, commended the Obama administration for giving undocumented youth ""deferred action"" to prevent deportation and declared his support for giving undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship once the border is secure. The real reason that Rubio matters is because he could well be a bridge between the Republican Party and those Hispanic voters that the GOP has done such a masterful job of angering and alienating. A new poll by Telemundo/NBC News/WSJ finds that while Rubio is not as popular as Democrats like President Barack Obama or former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, he is more popular than a lot of other Republicans -- 23 percent of Hispanics viewed Rubio favorably and only 12 percent unfavorably. More importantly, he has a large reservoir of undecided voters who he might still win over. The stakes are high for the 41-year-old freshman senator. By becoming the public face of immigration reform in the Senate, an initiative that includes not just enhanced border security but also that all-important pathway to citizenship for the undocumented, Rubio could make himself more popular with Hispanic voters. Or, if enough Hispanics decide that they don't like the details of the final product and consider it to be just as harsh as some of that GOP rhetoric that Rubio has complained about, well, then the whole effort could backfire and wind up making the schism between Hispanics and Republicans even wider than it is now. That second scenario seems more likely now that Cesar Conda, Rubio's very capable and well-regarded chief of staff, has taken to Twitter to leak details of what's actually in the bill. What Conda tweeted was a series of conditions and prohibitions that make it clear that -- despite the hysterical rants you hear on right-wing talk radio -- what the Gang of Eight is getting ready to propose is no ""amnesty,"" no cakewalk and no giveaway. Conda wrote: ""If enacted, Senate #immigrationreform (bill) will be the toughest enforcement and border security law in American history."" And this: ""Multiple enforcement and security triggers prior to any legalization and prior to any green card process."" And this: ""No access to welfare, and tough new eligibility standards to prevent legalization for those likely to require welfare in the future."" And this: ""Senate #immigrationreform freezes illegal population. No special pathway. No amnesty."" And this: ""No ability to earn citizenship for at least 13 years after bill is enacted, AND border security and interior enforcement is in place."" You get the idea. Senators aren't opening the floodgates. They're dropping the hammer. It's also been reported that legal status and eventual citizenship will only be made available to those who arrived in the United States before December 31, 2011. More recent arrivals would be subject to deportation. It all sounds reasonable. It's not exactly the kid-glove treatment, but it does stand to make better the lives of millions of people. Yet some Hispanics on the left are upset. They aren't satisfied. One dependably liberal radio talk show host posted on his Facebook page that -- judging just by what Conda had leaked -- what's coming is a ""crappy"" bill. It makes you wonder what people like this expect from immigration reform -- a benevolent stew of forgiveness and freebies, or an instant makeover from ""illegal immigrant"" to ""U.S. citizen"" with no strings attached? That is pie in the sky. Keep dreaming. That will never happen, and not just because it would be opposed by Republicans but many Democrats as well. And if this delicate negotiation falls through because reformers made the perfect the enemy of the good, what's behind Door No. 2? Answer: The status quo. An administration that uses local police officers to round up illegal immigrants through the dreadful program Secure Communities, where local police submit to federal authorities the fingerprints of anyone they arrest. An administration which will, by the end of 2013, have deported 2 million illegal immigrants -- more than any other in history. Homes are raided. Families are divided. Grandmothers are handcuffed. Children are hauled before immigration judges. A little perspective please. Of course, neither side is going to be 100% happy with any workable compromise. Solutions are hard to come by. But we can't set the bar too high. Because what the government is doing now only creates more problems. Marco Rubio seems to have figured that out. A lot of immigration reformers need to catch up.","Ruben Navarrette: Marco Rubio is the leader of ""Gang of Eight"" on immigration .

"A year after Mohamed Morsy became Egypt's first democratically-elected president, millions of Egyptians took to the streets calling for him to step down. Among the protesters' complaints was the alleged ""Brotherhoodization"" of the government -- the imposition of the Islamist views propagated by the Muslim Brotherhood, of which Morsy is a member. So what is the Muslim Brotherhood? The Muslim Brotherhood is a religious and political group founded on the belief that Islam is not simply a religion, but a way of life. It advocates a move away from secularism, and a return to the rules of the Quran as a basis for healthy families, communities, and states. The movement officially rejects the use of violent means to secure its goals. However, offshoots of the group have been linked to attacks in the past, and critics blame the Brotherhood for sparking troubles elsewhere in the Middle East. Many consider it the forerunner of modern militant Islamism. In a 1997 study for Harvard International Review, Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Chairman Mohammad Ma'mun El-Hudaibi said the Brotherhood was based on two ""key pillars."" They are: the introduction of the Islamic Sharia (way of life or principles) as the basis controlling the affairs of state and society and working ""to achieve unification among the Islamic countries and states, mainly among the Arab states, and liberating them from foreign imperialism."" When was the Brotherhood  created? The Muslim Brotherhood has been part of the political scene in Egypt for more than 80 years. It was formed there by Hassan al-Banna in 1928. Teacher al-Banna and his followers were initially united by a desire to oust the British from control in Egypt, and to rid their country of what they saw as ""corrupting"" Western influences. The original Brotherhood slogan was ""Islam is the solution."" What is its history? In its early years, the group concentrated on religion, education and social services, but as its membership grew, it moved into the political sphere, organizing protests against the Egyptian government. In the 1940s, an armed wing of the Brotherhood was blamed for a string of violent acts, including the assassination of Egyptian Prime Minister Mahmud Fahmi al-Nuqrashi in 1948 -- shortly after he had ordered the dissolution of the Muslim Brotherhood. Al-Banna himself was assassinated soon afterwards -- his supporters claimed he had been killed on the wishes of the government. The movement went underground in the 1950s, and decades of oppression by successive Egyptian rulers led many of the Brotherhood's members to flee abroad, while others were jailed. In the 1980s, the group disavowed violence and attempted to join the mainstream political process, but it was banned by the regime of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Nonetheless, the Brotherhood grew throughout the decade, as part of a general growth of interest in Islam, and the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 saw a spike in membership. In 2005, it won 20% of the seats in Egypt's parliamentary elections, running as independents. Mubarak cracked down on the group, jailing hundreds of members. Why is it important in Egypt? The Brotherhood is the oldest and largest opposition group in Egypt. It has had widespread support among Egypt's middle classes, and its members control many of the country's professional organizations. Up until 2011, it was illegal under Egyptian law banning all parties based on religion. But in December that year, its political party -- the Freedom and Justice Party -- dominated parliamentary elections, winning about half of the seats up for grabs. The group initially said it would not put forward a candidate for president, but Mohamed Morsy ran and in June 2012, became Egypt's first democratically-elected president. Read more: Who is Mohamed Morsy? So how successful has the Brotherhood been in power? Morsy came to power on June 30, 2012, but since then his approval ratings have plummeted. His government failed to keep order as the economy tanked and crime soared, including open sexual assaults on women in Egypt's streets.  The chaos drove away many tourists and investors. CNN's Ben Wedeman says the job of running Egypt today ""has to be one of the most difficult jobs on Earth."" He says once the Brotherhood took over, they found that much of the bureaucracy opposed them due to fears the group would impose their own supporters at every level of government. ""If you're president of Egypt and you can't trust your police and you're not sure about the army and you know that the bureaucracy doesn't like you, you're going to have a very difficult job at running this very complicated country,"" Wedeman said. Read more: Morsy has few friends as deadline looms . Is there still support for the Muslim Brotherhood? Columnist Frida Ghitis says one of the most striking things about the 2013 protests against Morsy has been the intensity of anger towards the Muslim Brotherhood. She points out that in June 2013, more people had signed a Tamarod -- or rebel -- petition to withdraw support for Morsy  than voted for him in the election -- a sign, she says that ""discontent has spread beyond the liberals, or former regime supporters."" Read more: Egyptians are fed up with Morsy . Why has the brotherhood fallen out of favor? Ghitis argues that the Brotherhood and Morsy's credibility suffered when they ""repeatedly broke their word."" Ed Husain, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, points out that Morsy promised, then failed to appoint a female vice president and a Coptic Christian deputy, for example. Read more: Give Morsy a chance to fix this . Egyptians accuse Morsy and the Brotherhood of engaging in a process of ""ikhwaninzation"" -- or ""Brotherhoodization"", Ghitis says, describing it as ""a quest to take control of state institutions and impose their Islamist views on the population."" ""In the first wave of elections, many voters thought if they were Muslim -- as most Egyptians are -- they should vote for the Muslim Brotherhood. And they thought secular was synonymous with atheist. Now they're discovering how religion can be exploited for power,"" Ghitis says. Egyptian historian Khaled Fahmy says Morsy adopted a ""hard line, exclusive approach,"" choosing Muslim Brotherhood members or sympathizers for powerful and not so powerful positions in his government and the broader Egyptian administration. Read more: 'We did not risk our lives simply to change the players' So has the Brotherhood lost its power in Egypt? CNN's Reza Sayah says Egypt's Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood have a history of perseverance. For decades they were oppressed, sidelined, sometimes torture and even killed - most recently under the Mubarak regime, he says, but they managed to stay organized. He says losing power after so long could be a bitter pill to swallow. How influential is the Brotherhood elsewhere? There are branches of the Muslim Brotherhood in countries across the Middle East and North and East Africa, including Sudan, Syria and Saudi Arabia. There is also a branch in the U.S. Its offshoots outside Egypt are markedly more conservative in their views: The Kuwaiti branch is said to oppose the right of women to vote. Sayyid Qutb, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1950s and 1960s, developed the doctrine of jihad, and the radical group Hamas is believed to be an offshoot of the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood.","The Muslim Brotherhood was formed in Egypt by Hassan al-Banna in 1928 .

"Almost two years ago, Philadelphia launched its Healthy Chinese Take-out Initiative with the goal of reducing sodium content by 10% to 15%. The city's Public Health Department worked with 206 restaurants, first evaluating their menus for sodium content and then helping them choose ingredients and develop recipes with less sodium. One way found to reduce sodium was for restaurants to cut the use of commercially prepared sauces and instead make their own. After nine months, the initiative analyzed two popular dishes from 20 participating restaurants to see what changed. The result? A 20% reduction in sodium, more than the project's goal. It's one thing to choose how much salt to add to your food when you eat. It's another to live with decisions made by those who prepare your food before it makes it to the table. It's not a question of just putting down the salt shaker. The vast majority of sodium consumed in the United States comes from processed and restaurant foods. Americans eat out, on average, almost five times a week, and restaurant foods make up a surprisingly high percentage of sodium in the American diet. On average, food from fast-food restaurants contains about 1,850 milligrams of sodium per 1,000 calories and food from sit-down restaurants has nearly 2,100 milligrams per 1,000 calories. Many restaurant meals have twice that many calories or more. Toddler meals swimming in salt . U.S. dietary guidelines recommend limiting sodium to less than 2,300 milligrams a day -- and about six in 10 adults should further limit sodium to 1,500 milligrams a day. Excess sodium can lead to high blood pressure, a major contributor to heart disease and stroke. An article published Thursday by scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""From Menu to Mouth: Opportunities for Sodium Reduction in Restaurants,"" offers strategies that reduce sodium in restaurant food. Restaurants can provide nutrition information at the point of purchase to give consumers the option to make healthier choices. They can also create group purchasing organizations to save on bulk purchases of lower-sodium ingredients. Health departments can make dietitians available to assist restaurants with nutrition support. It all boils down to: reduce, replace, reformulate. When restaurants rethink how they prepare food and the ingredients they use, the healthy choice becomes the easy one for the customer. The story in Philadelphia shows it can be done. The CDC collaborates with the food industry to reduce sodium in the food supply and provides technical assistance for this important work. We monitor programs to see what's working in sodium reduction as well as broader blood pressure control initiatives through Million Hearts, the national public-private effort to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes over the next five years. And we share that information through papers such as the one published Thursday. Reducing sodium in restaurant and prepared foods isn't about reducing choice -- just the opposite. By reducing sodium in the foods you buy, companies put control into your hands. After all, it's easy to add salt if you want to, but not to take it out if it's there.","Philadelphia's sodium-reducing initiative is a success story, CDC's Dr. Tom Frieden says .

"(CNN) -- New junior federal prosecutors literally started in the basement of the U.S. courthouse in downtown Brooklyn. I moved into my subterranean office in January 1990. A few weeks later, Loretta Lynch moved into her new digs down the hall. We were assistant U.S. attorneys in the Eastern District of New York, which covers Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island. The work of this U.S. attorney's office is unglamorous, especially for new hires. Our jurisdiction included John F. International Kennedy Airport in Queens, so our introductory cases often involved low-level drug smuggling, especially the ""swallowers"" who ingested condoms full of cocaine or heroin. Lynch thrived in that chaotic environment. And now, two-plus decades later, it looks like she will be the next attorney general of the United States. She has been U.S. attorney twice in the courthouse where she came up -- first under President Bill Clinton and currently under President Barack Obama. She is not a well-known figure, even in New York. She is a workhorse, not a show horse, and she has flourished doing the hard, ordinary work of federal prosecution -- narcotics cases, organized crime (always big in Brooklyn), public corruption (ditto) and civil rights violations. Lynch has showed her strengths more as an administrator than as a courtroom performer. She always had good relations with the U.S. attorney's ""clients"" -- the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and other law enforcement agencies. Still, against heavy pressure from the New York police, she led a full investigation and prosecution of the horrible assault of Abner Louima by NYPD officers in 1997. She is a tough and successful New Yorker, but she has also never forgotten her North Carolina roots. There is a Southern graciousness about her (and her accent), and it will certainly be on display in any confirmation hearings. Two major questions loom over her prospective tenure as attorney general. First, will she continue the emphasis on voting rights that Eric Holder displayed? The answer is almost certainly yes. Like Holder, she comes from the generation after the civil rights movement, but it is part of her DNA, and that will come through in her priorities. The more interesting question involves drugs. Holder moved carefully but steadily to reduce federal prosecutions of low-level narcotics offenses, especially marijuana. In addition, he started plans to lower the sentences of federal inmates who were convicted under those laws. Will Lynch continue these efforts? She has no public track record on these policy issues, though she has aggressively prosecuted narcotics offenders in Brooklyn. This area offers a possible route for cooperation with some Republicans, like Sen. Rand Paul, who were sympathetic to Holder on this issue. In any event, one verdict is clear: Lynch has come a long way from that basement we shared.","Jeffrey Toobin, who worked with Loretta Lynch, says she thrived in chaotic U.S. court in Brooklyn .
She showed strength there more as administrator than courtroom performer, Toobin says .

"A Chicago man confessed to killing his girlfriend's mother, whose body was found last month in a suitcase outside a hotel in Indonesia, police in Bali tell CNN. The girlfriend also confessed to being involved and trying to get rid of her mother's body, police say. Heather Mack, 19, and Tommy Schaefer, 21, have been detained as suspects in the death of Mack's mother, Sheila von Weise Mack, and ""it appears that the motive for the killing was because she was against Schaefer's relationship with Heather,"" Bali police spokesman Hery Wiyanto told CNN. Formal charges are pending, as the investigation continues. What exactly happened in room 317 of the St. Regis Bali Resort and the exact role Heather Mack has is still under investigation, said Denpasar police Chief Djoko Hari Utomo. Evidence includes surveillance video of an argument between the couple and the victim at the hotel and of the two suspects entering and exiting the hotel room, according to Wiyanto. The badly beaten body of Sheila Mack, 61, was wrapped in a blood-stained bed sheet and placed in a large hard-sided suitcase, Indonesian authorities said. The young couple allegedly put the suitcase in the trunk of a taxi outside the hotel on August 12 and went back into the hotel, telling the cab driver that they would be back, authorities said. After a lengthy wait, the cab driver noticed blood and contacted police. Authorities at the South Kuta station in Bali opened the case and found the body, police said. The daughter and her boyfriend were later found at another hotel about 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the St. Regis. The couple's St. Regis room was ""very messy,"" with clothes still inside, authorities said. The couple initially told police they had been taken captive at the resort by an armed gang, whose members killed Sheila Mack, but they escaped, CNN affiliate Trans TV reported.","Heather Mack, 19, and Tommy Schaefer, 21, of Chicago area confess, police say .

"Three days after a fatal case of Marburg hemorrhagic fever was diagnosed in Uganda, 99 people have been quarantined in four different locations across the East African country, as field epidemiologists and surveillance officers continue to closely monitor all people who got into contact with only victim. More than 60 health workers form the bulk of people under quarantine after they were identified as having contact with a 30-year old male health worker who died September 28 of Marburg -- an Ebola-like hemorrhagic fever. ""As of today, a total of 99 contacts are under follow up. All the contacts are still in a healthy condition,"" Dr. Jane Ruth Aceng, director general for health services in Uganda, said in the latest update on the outbreak on Tuesday. ""The National Taskforce through the field epidemiologists and surveillance officers continues to closely monitor all people who got into contact with this confirmed case,"" she noted. The dead health worker was a radiographer in a hospital in the capital of  Kampala and also at Mpigi District Health Center IV,  places where authorities say he made contact with colleagues. Aceng revealed that at least 11 people have tested negative after results from Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) indicate that although the suspects had developed signs and symptoms similar to that of the disease, they did not contract the virus. ""However, for those who continue to have signs, tests will be run again after three days,"" Dr. Aceng said. Among those who tested negative include are the brother of the deceased; two health workers from a children HIV/AIDS hospital; seven persons from Mpigi Health Center IV; and two relatives of the deceased who participated in the burial. ""When he felt ill on September 17, he traveled back to Mpigi for treatment since he felt more comfortable with a facility that he had worked with for a long time, a duration the disease was spread,"" said a statement by health authorities last Sunday. Marburg virus was first identified in 1967, when 31 people became sick in Germany and Yugoslavia in an outbreak that was eventually traced back to laboratory monkeys imported from Uganda. Since then the virus has appeared sporadically, with just a dozen outbreaks on record, many -- including the current situation -- involving just a single patient. Marburg virus causes symptoms similar to Ebola, beginning with fever and weakness and often leading to internal or external bleeding, organ failure and death. The death rate runs as high as 80 percent, although it was significantly lower in the initial outbreak when patients were cared for in relatively modern, European hospitals. The most recent outbreak, also in Uganda, in 2012, killed four out of 15 patients, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Tuesday, CDC Director Thomas Frieden pointed to the most recent Marburg case as an example of how a deadly virus could be contained. ""We've done important work in Uganda to help the Ugandans better have a laboratory network so they can find cases, have a response network with disease detectives who can follow up and have an emergency operations center to trace individual cases,"" Frieden said. The extensive contact tracing included tracking an embalmer back to Kenya, where he was tested and found not to be infected with Marburg. ""I mention this, because oftentimes in public health, what gets noticed is what happens and it's hard to see what doesn't happen,"" Frieden continued, noting that there have so far been no additional cases. ""That may not make headlines, but it does give us confidence that we can control Ebola in West Africa.""","30-year-old male health worker in Uganda dies of Marburg .

"Are the media reveling in the David Petraeus scandal just a bit too much? The question sort of answers itself. Journalists are secretly grateful to the former four-star general for rescuing us from six weeks of sober coverage about the fiscal cliff. Not that anyone wants to plunge over the cliff, but daily reports on White House negotiations with John Boehner are no one's idea of a wild time. So let's face it: We are wallowing in the tawdriness of this tale. But are the media losing perspective -- and rushing to judgment? Let's concede up front that the story is inherently fascinating. A general with a walk-on-water reputation abruptly quits the CIA and admits an extramarital affair. His mistress turns out to be his admiring biographer, who hawked her book all over television. Watch: An orgy of media advice on getting away with an affair . Then we learn that she triggered an FBI probe by sending what were perceived as harassing e-mails to a military volunteer in Tampa -- and that a friendly FBI agent allegedly sent that woman shirtless photos. All of which was a prelude to the reports that Gen. John Allen, who in his spare time is running the war in Afghanistan, exchanged up to 30,000 e-mails with said Tampa woman. See? It's hard to keep up. The military sex saga has all the earmarks of a sizzling soap opera. But let's take a step back. A couple of steps, in fact. Those 30,000 e-mails initially described by sources as ""flirtatious""? Unnamed defense officials put out the word the next day that there were far fewer -- maybe a few hundred, one told The Washington Post -- and that there was ""no affair"" between Allen and Jill Kelley, the Tampa activist. Or perhaps they were ""overly flirtatious,"" anonymous Pentagon officials told The New York Times, and there were 30,000 pages but some  just contained a single sentence. And Allen may have called Kelley ""sweetheart"" in the e-mails, reports The Wall Street Journal. Watch: Media mistakes murky in Petraeus sex scandal . As for the e-mails from Paula Broadwell, Petraeus' biographer, to Kelley, I've seen them described as everything from threatening to harassing to chastising Kelley for acting like a ""seductress"" toward Petraeus. Again, we don't really know. What about the notion that Broadwell was terribly indiscreet in her relationship with Petraeus? Her ghostwriter, the Post's Vernon Loeb, says he was ""clueless"" about any affair. There is, to be sure, a practical problem here. The principals aren't talking much. New information and insinuations tend to trickle out through friends, associates and officials-speaking-on-background, which leaves a sizable void that has sometimes been filled by speculation. Nor have journalists covered themselves with glory by staking out the women's homes. Kelley has called local police asking for ""diplomatic protection"" against the media mob that has camped out near her residence, according to the Fox station in Tampa Bay. What, exactly, did she do to warrant this treatment? Watch: Businessweek retreats from piece on B-schools with hottest women . Now we come to the heart of the matter. Petraeus, who has risked his life and been wounded as a soldier, showed bad judgment and fooled around. That's not exactly an aberration in the highest levels of politics. Perhaps you recall the name Bill Clinton, now a global statesman. So what is driving the story? Why has the press devoted far more attention to Petraeus' personal life than, say, his agency's role in the fatal attack in Benghazi? Our culture tends to put generals on a pedestal, and none more so than Petraeus, who courted journalists assiduously and received favorable coverage in return. The mighty media machine turned David Petraeus into a household name, and now his image is crumbling beneath the weight of that machine. The fame he sought is being used against him. If the secretary of commerce gets caught carrying on with a smitten young woman, it's a two-day story. There are other factors. Some commentators who opposed Petraeus' role in George W. Bush's surge in Iraq are using his fall from grace to settle scores. And don't ignore the pop-culture element, swirling around this question: If the nation's top spy can't keep an affair secret, who can? But we have reached the point where the enormity of the media spectacle far exceeds the news value of the revelation that one of America's top military leaders was also a flawed human being.

"The second suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings was taken into custody Friday night, bringing to an end a massive manhunt in the tense Massachusetts capital worried by warnings the man was possibly armed with explosives. After announcing the arrest on Twitter, Boston police tweeted: ""CAPTURED!!! The hunt is over. The search is done. The terror is over. And justice has won. Suspect in custody."" Authorities confirmed the man in custody is 19-year-old Dzhokar Tsarnaev, who escaped an overnight shootout with police that left his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- the other man wanted in the bombings -- dead. The younger Tsarnaev was in serious condition, Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said at a news conference. He was being treated at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, hospital spokeswoman Kelly Lawman said. Tsarnaev was cornered late Friday as he was hiding on a boat in a backyard of Watertown, a suburb of Boston. Police were alerted to his whereabouts by a man who went outside after authorities lifted an order for residents to stay inside during the manhunt. The resident saw blood on a boat in the backyard, Davis said. He then lifted up the tarp covering the boat and ""saw a man covered with blood,"" he said. It was that call that resulted in an arrest less than a week after two bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, shocking the nation and leaving a city on edge. ""There was an exchange of gunfire, and I don't know if he was struck,"" Davis said of the suspect. Authorities, using a bullhorn, had called on the suspect to surrender: ""Come out with your hands up."" Tsarnaev, according to authorities, refused to surrender. ""We used a robot to pull the tarp off the boat,"" David Procopio of the Massachusetts State Police said. ""We were also watching him with a thermal imaging camera in our helicopter. He was weakened by blood loss -- injured last night most likely,"" Tsarnaev was taken into custody after authorities rushed the boat, Davis said. Closing a chapter . The standoff and subsequent arrest came just minutes after authorities indicated during a news conference that a manhunt for the suspect appeared to come up empty. Authorities had cast a wide net for the suspect, virtually shutting down Boston and its surroundings after a violent night in which authorities say the brothers allegedly hurled explosives at pursuers, after killing Massachusetts Institute of Technology police Officer Sean Collier and hijacking a car. ""We've closed an important chapter in this tragedy,"" President Barack Obama said in a televised address. Even so, he vowed to seek answers to the motive in the attack and find out whether the suspects received any help to carry out their plot. The government is invoking the public safety exception to question Tsarnaev, meaning in cases of national security a person can be questioned without being read their Miranda rights, a Justice Department official told CNN on condition of anonymity. The official is not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz told reporters the ""government has that opportunity right now"" to invoke the public safety exemption but stopped short of declaring it would take that step, saying only the suspect was in the hospital. Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham called for Tsarnaev to be held as an enemy combatant. 'Glad it's over' Word of the arrest spread quickly in suburban Watertown, where residents took to the streets to cheer the news that suspect had been arrested. ""Thank you. Thank you. It was our pleasure,"" members of the Boston SWAT team said over a loudspeaker. Mary Sullivan was walking her black Labrador earlier Friday night when gunshots rang out in her neighborhood. ""I'm glad it's over,"" she said. ""The city and the people have gone through so much pain over these irrational decisions of these young men."" Bombing connection . The manhunt began late Thursday just hours after the FBI released photos of the two suspects in the marathon bombings. ""Investigators are recovering a significant amount of homemade explosives"" from the scene of the shootout, Procopio told CNN. It was not immediately clear what explosives were recovered, but the discovery followed a tense night in which authorities say the brothers allegedly hurled a homemade grenade and five pipe bombs at pursuers after killing an officer and hijacking a car. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was wearing explosives and a triggering device when he died, a source briefed on the investigation told CNN on condition of anonymity. The manhunt brought Boston to a near standstill. The Boston Red Sox announced they were postponing Friday night's game against the Kansas City Royals ""to support efforts of law enforcement officers."" NHL's Boston Bruins also postponed its game against the Pittsburgh Penguins. The city's subway, bus, Amtrak train and Greyhound and regional Bolt Bus services were shut down. Taxi service across the city also was suspended for a time during the manhunt. Every Boston area school was closed. Boston's public transit authority sent city buses to Watertown to evacuate residents while bomb experts combed the surroundings for possible explosives. Initially, authorities said the brothers started their rampage by robbing a convenience store. By late Friday, the Middlesex District Attorney's office backtracked on the allegation, saying an investigation determined that the robbery at a 7-Eleven was unrelated. Officer killed . The violent hours leading up to the capture began in Cambridge, across the Charles River from Boston, MIT officer Collier was shot and killed while he sat in his car on Thursday night, the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office said in a statement. The two suspects, according to authorities, then hijacked a vehicle at gunpoint in Cambridge, telling the driver that they were the marathon bombers, a law enforcement source told CNN. At some point, apparently at a gas station, that source said, the driver escaped. Police, who were tracking the vehicle using its built-in GPS system, picked up the chase in Watertown. The pursuit went into a residential neighborhood, with the suspects throwing explosives at police. A shootout erupted and ultimately one bomber -- later identified as Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- got out of the car. Police shot him, and his brother ran over him as he drove away, according to the law enforcement source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Richard H. Donohue Jr., 33, a three-year veteran of the transit system police force, was shot and wounded in the incident and taken to a hospital, a transit police spokesman said Friday. The officer's condition was not immediately known. Another 15 police officers were treated for minor injuries sustained during the explosions and shootout, Jennifer Kovalich, a spokeswoman for St. Elizabeth's Medical Center, said. Suspects background . Police believe the brothers are the same men pictured in images released Thursday by the FBI as suspects in the marathon bombing that killed three people and wounded dozens on Monday. At least 58 people remained hospitalized, including three in critical condition, according to a CNN count. The men are shown in the images walking together near the marathon finish line. The first suspect -- apparently Tamerlan Tsarnaev, according to authorities -- appears in the images wearing a dark hat, sunglasses and a backpack. The second suspect, wearing a white cap, police said, is the one who remained at large throughout Friday until he was taken into custody Friday night. But the mother of the Tsarnaev brothers refused to believe they were involved in the marathon bombings and subsequent shootout. ""It's impossible for them to do such things. I am really telling you that this is a setup,"" Zubeidat Tsarnaeva told state-run Russia Today from Dagestan. ""My son would never keep it in secret. ...If there is anyone who would know it would be me. He wouldn't hide it. But there was never a word."" The brothers came from the Russian Caucasus region and moved to Kazakhstan at a young age before coming to the United States several years ago. ""My youngest was raised from 8 years in America. My oldest was really properly raised in our house. Nobody talked about terrorism,"" their mother said. The suspects' parents recently returned to Dagestan in the Caucasus region after living in the United States for about 10 years because they were ""nostalgic,"" the father, Anzor Tsarnaev, told Russian state-run Zvezda TV. He accused someone of framing his sons. ""I don't know who exactly did it. But someone did."" A federal official told CNN that Dzhokar Tsarnaev came to the U.S. as a tourist with his family in the early 2000s and later asked for asylum. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2012. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was not a naturalized citizen, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He came ""a few years later"" and was lawfully in the United States as a green-card holder. Tamerlan Tsarnaev had studied at Bunker Hill Community College and wanted to become an engineer, according to those who knew him. He then took a year off to train as a boxer. 'I don't understand them' The official said that a posting on a social media site in the elder brother's name included the comments: ""I don't have a single American friend. I don't understand them."" Dzhokar Tsarnaev attended Cambridge Rindge & Latin, a public high school, said Eric Mercado, who graduated a year behind the suspect. Mercado said Tsarnaev had worked at Harvard University as a lifeguard. ""We hung out; we partied; we were good high school friends,"" Mercado told CNN. ""We're all, like, in shock.

Mercado said he lived a block away from the suspect and did not know his older brother. Dzhokar Tsarnaev is currently registered as a student at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, which ordered its campus evacuated on Friday. The school is located 65 miles south of Cambridge, just west of New Bedford. Larry Aaronson, Dzhokar Tsarnaev's neighbor and a former teacher at the high school Tsarnaev attended, called him a ""wonderful kid."" ""He was so grateful to be here, he was compassionate, he was caring, he was jovial,"" Aaronson told CNN.","58 people remain hospitalized from Monday's bombings, according to a CNN tally .

"It's miserable outside. The whole world is a depressing gray color that just makes you want to lie on the couch and watch reruns of ""Sex and the City."" You don't have time to pack your gym bag, drop off the kids, drive to the fitness studio, shower and change, pick up the kids and get back home before dinner. Plus, you're really tired of floor mats that reek and that woman in the back row who always steps left instead of right, effectively knocking you down on your out-of-shape gluteus maximus. Whatever your reason is for not wanting to hit the gym, Kristin Knee of Flirty Girl Fitness understands. ""I don't even want to go to my own studio when it's raining,"" she said with a laugh. That's why late last year, she and her sister, Kerry, launched Flirty Girl Fitness LIVE, a Web service that streams three or four of their franchise's group classes every day. Subscribers can log in at home and participate in classes like ""Bikini Bootcamp"" or ""Hottie Body Boxing"" from their living room. The classes stay online for 24 hours and then are replaced with the next day's workouts. Unlimited subscription passes are $15 a month. Online video streaming is just starting to blossom in the fitness industry, IDEA Health and Fitness Association editor Sandy Todd Webster says. Several sites offer similar programs, including Yogis Anonymous, Connect Online Fitness, EMG Live Fitness and DailyBurn. ""It seems like the next natural progression to home fitness DVDs,"" Webster said. ""It's another way of making fitness more convenient for yourself."" Knee was shocked by how quickly the LIVE service caught on with her regular members. People were doing classes on their lunch break at work or logging in while on vacation. ""You know you have a [workout] DVD, and it's an awesome DVD, but the girl tells the same joke every day,"" Knee said. ""This is always live, always fresh, and you feel like you're there."" Variety is one of the reasons Joyce Wells loves group fitness classes. But when Wells moved to the suburbs from New York, she was disappointed with the caliber of local studios. The businesswoman remembered how much her colleagues at Microsoft had loved video conferencing during meetings. Her subsequent research on online paid content revealed astonishing numbers: In 2010, the National Football League raked in $500 million in revenue from its streaming services; Major League Baseball earned $450 million. Netflix's digital revenue totaled more than $1.5 billion. So Wells launched EMG Live Fitness, an Internet-based fitness studio that streams classes from instructors across the country. There's no subscription for Wells' site; classes are bought for $5 apiece. In Wells' opinion, the fitness industry is dragging its feet in making the transition online. The brick-and-mortar gyms are afraid of catalyzing their current market, she says. ""It's going to be like Netflix was to Blockbuster. Blockbuster refused to let go of that model, and look at what happened to them."" (Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in September 2010). Wells' target market is stay-at-home mothers and people who are obese. But online classes appeal to anyone who's uncomfortable in a gym setting, Webster says. ""You hear, 'I can't go to the gym until I get in shape,' "" Webster said. ""This gives them privacy ... to experience it on their own without feeling self-conscious. This could go a long way to promoting compliance because it's convenient and portable."" Webster says personal trainers also use online video libraries to encourage clients to keep up with their workouts. While on-demand fitness video libraries are nothing new, they're becoming more elaborate. Fitness company Daily Burn recently introduced HD-quality, customized video workouts on DailyBurn.com. The workouts are led by the ""DB6,"" a team of six instructors who have a variety of areas of expertise. DailyBurn asks new users questions about their ability levels and goals. It then uses the site's ""IntelliBurn"" technology to analyze and stream a personalized workout. By adding the video service, CEO Andy Smith and his producers have turned the site into one giant personal trainer. ""It doesn't put you in a certain bucket,"" Smith said. ""It learns about you as you go, constantly monitoring what workout you did yesterday, are you hitting a plateau. ... People really want to stay motivated and be told what to do."" Nearly 20% of all TVs worldwide will be connected to the Internet by 2016, according to Digital TV Research, which will make it even easier for online fitness videos to infiltrate America's living rooms. Put bluntly, there are no more excuses. ""People are realizing more and more that there's not a magic pill for [weight loss],"" Smith said. ""You just need to get started.""","Fitness studios are streaming live classes online or compiling video workout libraries .

"(CNN)The divers initially thought the gleaming object they noticed on the seafloor off the Israeli coast was a toy coin from a game. But they quickly realized they had stumbled across something a whole lot more valuable in the ancient Mediterranean harbor of Caesarea. Their chance discovery a few weeks ago led to a trove of nearly 2,000 gold coins that had languished at the bottom of the sea for about 1,000 years, the Israel Antiquities Authority said Tuesday. It's the biggest hoard of gold coins ever discovered in Israel -- and it could lead to further archaeological finds. ""There is probably a shipwreck there of an official treasury boat which was on its way to the central government in Egypt with taxes that had been collected,"" said Kobi Sharvit, director of the Marine Archaeology Unit of the antiquities authority. He offered other theories about the origin of the treasure. Perhaps the coins were meant to pay the salaries of a military garrison in Caesarea, Sharvit speculated, or came from a merchant ship that sank while traveling from port to port along the Mediterranean coast. Marine archaeologists are planning to carry out salvage work at the site to find out more. The coins themselves come in several different denominations and are very well preserved, the antiquities authority said. The oldest of them is a quarter dinar minted in Palermo, Sicily, in the second half of the ninth century. Most of the pieces, though, are from the Fatimid Caliphate, the Shiite Muslim empire that ruled large parts of North Africa and the Middle East around the turn of the first millennium. Sharvit said he believed the coins, of various dimensions and weights, had been uncovered by winter storms. He thanked the people who found the treasure -- members of a local diving club -- for quickly reporting their discovery rather than trying to keep the coins for themselves. ""These divers are model citizens,"" he said. ""They discovered the gold and have a heart of gold that loves the country and its history.""","Nearly 2,000 gold coins had sat at the bottom of the sea for around 1,000 years .

"An hour or so drive from the chaotic and congested streets of downtown Cairo is a very different world. Thousands of pristine new buildings -- many only half-built -- often within gated compounds are surrounded by miles of barren desert. New Cairo is one of a handful of ""satellite cities"" that are being developed in the desert about 40 kilometers from the city center. The landscape is far from conventionally beautiful, but attracted the attention of a British photographer Jason Larkin who spent two years chronicling the developments. Cairo's satellite cities have been developed on-and-off for 30 years, but a recent building boom has slowed since the fall of president Hosni Mubarak in February. Larkin became interested after the American University of Cairo moved to a new campus in New Cairo in 2008. ""I started to hear from students who were alarmed to find themselves in the middle of the desert,"" he said. ""I wanted to look for myself and was struck by the environment. ""They were pristine buildings but with completely barren surroundings. You can't get there by public transport. I realized it had so little of what a city needs."" Larkin spent two years photographing Cairo's satellite cities and their construction sites. He said: ""There were many projects I never saw any work on: Half-finished construction sites where people with big ideas had run out of money. ""Others have been halted because of disputes and allegations of corruption over the sale of the land."" Larkin added: ""Of all the areas I photographed, I would say 80% were not occupied."" For centuries, the population of Cairo -- now 10.9 million, according to the CIA World Factbook  -- was confined to a narrow strip of fertile land along the River Nile. In 1969 a development plan was launched to expand Greater Cairo into the surrounding deserts, according to a 2009 report by U.N. Habitat, the United Nations agency for human settlements . Mohamed Elshahed, a doctoral student who started a blog, Cairobserver, on the city's architecture and urban planning, has also taken an interest in satellite cities. He said the gated compounds of villas for the wealthy currently being built were opposite to the initial intention of satellite cities. Elshahed said: ""The development of satellite cities has gone through several false starts. The initial idea in the 1970s was to respond to the housing crisis and create budget or social housing projects. The problem was that the poorest can't afford to live so far away without transport to bring them to work. ""This initial phase was a complete failure and mostly remained vacant. There were further attempts in the 1990s. Now we are seeing a reverse of the initial idea and they are exclusively high-end developments."" Ehshahed said the gated compounds were being developed at the expense of preserving the historic city center. ""There's no recognition of Cairo's architectural heritage and history,"" he said. ""It's as if we're living in Dubai, but this isn't Dubai, it's a city that's been around for 1,000 years."" Elshahed added: ""The center of the city is deteriorating and the rich don't want to be there anymore. They can afford to live outside the city and cut themselves off."" However, Elshahed said that despite having a combined population estimated at 1.5 million, the satellite cities had failed to ease the overcrowding of Cairo. He said: ""The satellite cities are not working for many reasons. The main reason is that a housing bubble was created in the last five-to-eight years without the demand to fill them, leaving a lot of empty homes in the desert. ""Plus a lot of people who can afford these types of houses, already have second or third homes, so they are empty most of the time and it does nothing to help the housing crisis. ""There has been a government policy that this type of development is a positive sign of progress and is to be encouraged, but that is very superficial because they are not really helping anyone."" Elshahed said the main cities with names such as 6 October and 15 May, as well as New Cairo, were each made up of many individual developments, some a further 15 or 20 minutes drive into the desert. Working with the Cairo-based journalist Jack Shenker, Larkin produced a 6,000-word photo essay on satellite cities, called Cairo Divided, in English and Arabic, available for only the cost of postage and packing. ""We had 5,000 copies printed and have had phenomenal interest from people interested in urban development, Cairo itself, or global cities generally.""","Cairo's satellite cities were first conceived more than 30 years ago to ease overcrowding .
Recently they have become home to exclusive gated compounds, often standing empty .

"Maybe Justin Timberlake and friends weren't so crazy after all. Myspace, the once dominant social-networking site that faded into obscurity during Facebook's rise to dominance, added 1 million new users over the past month, according to the company. ""The numbers tell an amazing story of strong momentum and dramatic change for Myspace,"" said Tim Vanderhook, CEO of Myspace. ""And the 1 million-plus new user accounts we've seen in the last 30 days validates our approach."" A team of investors bought out Myspace in June for the fire-sale price of $35 million. Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. paid (many would say overpaid) $580 million for it in 2005. The new owners, most notably pop star/actor Timberlake, have effectively stopped trying to compete with Facebook and other social sites, instead focusing on Myspace's superior platform for posting and listening to music. Monday's release from Specific Media credited the site's new music player, with access to more than 42 million songs, as offering the Web's biggest collection of free music. By comparison, Internet darling Spotify, which launched in the United States in July, was claiming 15 million songs at that time. ""Myspace is building meaningful social entertainment experience around content, where consumers can share and discover the music they love,"" Vanderhook said. ""Consumers are getting excited about Myspace again -- a testament to a great music product."" The new Myspace player offers unlimited, on-demand listening to both established and unsigned artists, personalized radio modes, a recommendation engine and easy integration with Facebook. Obviously, it remains to be seen whether the resurgence (which has amounted to roughly 40,000 new sign-ups a day) will continue. But with Spotify beginning to limit the number of songs users with free accounts can play, it seems possible there could be space for a new online music player serving up similar content for free.","Myspace announces 1 million new users in a month .

Billing itself as ""Tinder, minus the riff-raff,"" the app, launched this month for Android and in May for Apple devices, is designed to play matchmaker for the rich and beautiful -- all others be damned. ""With the rise of high-speed digital dating, it's about time somebody introduced a filter to weed out low-income prospects by neighborhood,"" said the CEO of Luxy in a media release. Who is that CEO? Good question. A Luxy spokesman on Tuesday would only identify him as ""Tim T."" (It is worth noting, perhaps, that the only written review of the app in the Google Play store on Tuesday was a 5-star entry by a user with the screen name ""Tim T."") Spokesman Darren Shuster said the decision to keep ""Tim's"" identity private is likely due to negative feedback the app has received. Luxy claims that the average income of male users is $200,000. Shuster said, via email, that the team behind the app is working on an income-verification system but, in the meantime, is looking to the community to police itself. ""If you show up in a 20-year-old VW Bug, and request to meet at McDonald's, you won't last very long on LUXY,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The energy needs of the world could all, in principle, be fulfilled by one single source -- the sun. There are challenges in making this a reality, however: affordability first, and finding a way to capture this energy efficiently to turn it into electricity. Recently, a new material known as perovskite has seen the light of day and within just a few years it has started rivaling the efficiency of traditional photovoltaic solar cells, which currently maxes out at roughly 20 percent. This is the amount of solar energy that gets converted into electricity and the higher this is, the more we meet our energy needs. Over 80 percent of today's photovoltaics are made from crystalline silicon, but the high expense of both their production and installation means we are in need of alternatives. Perovskite is a mineral found in the Earth's mantle, named after Russian mineralogist Lev Perovski. Since 2009, it has caught the attention of researchers across the globe, including those at Oxford University and the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL). ""In a very short time, perovskite has begun to produce extremely high efficiencies and there's 'perovskite fever' going on,"" says Michael Graetzel, Director of the Laboratory of Photonics and Interfaces at EPFL. ""Today, efficiency has peaked at 18 percent, but it's expected to get even higher in the future."" Graetzel discovered how perovskite works and he's helping develop new solar cells as well as potential ways to add on to existing ones: ""You can put perovskite on top of traditional silicon cells to make them more efficient,"" he says. ""This is not an expensive process and can become an attractive application for mainstream solar panels."" Stability tests are still needed as this magical material is sensitive to water and high temperatures: ""This is all being examined now. I'm optimistic and sure this can be tackled. It's an exciting time"". Perovskite solar cells may be the ones to watch, but the search for the most efficient, affordable and usable form of solar energy is a diverse battlefield.

"Eight Los Angeles police officers violated department policy for use of deadly force when they shot two women during last year's manhunt for renegade ex-officer Christopher Dorner, police chief Charlie Beck said Tuesday. ""I sympathize with the officers, but I have a very high standard for the application of deadly force and the shooting did not meet that standard,"" Beck told reporters. Margie Carranza, 47, and her mother, Emma Hernandez, 71, were shot as police searched for Dorner, a former police officer who was wanted for killing several people in early February 2013. The two women were in a pickup truck similar to the one authorities said Dorner was driving and the officers had received reports that the suspect was in the area. 'A tragic cascade of circumstance' The police chief said Tuesday that state law prohibits him from discussing punishment for individual officers. ""Discipline could be anywhere from extensive retraining up to termination,"" according to Beck.  ""All officers involved have been assigned to non-field duty since this event occurred."" The two women were out delivering morning newspapers when they were shot. Beck said one of the officers mistook the sound of a paper hitting the ground as a gunshot and opened fire, followed by other officers also firing their weapons. ""This was a tragic cascade of circumstance that led to an inaccurate conclusion by the officers,"" Beck said. Hernandez was shot twice in the back and Carranza suffered injuries from broken glass. City settles . They agreed to split a $4.2 million settlement, attorneys for the city and the women told reporters in April.  The Los Angeles City Council approved the payout in June.  Earlier, the women received $40,000 to replace their bullet-riddled pickup truck in a separate settlement. Dorner died February 12 while holed up in a cabin in Bear Lake, California, that caught fire when police fired tear gas canisters into it. Days before, he had killed four people and wounded three others as part of a vendetta against his former comrades before apparently taking his own life in the cabin. Dorner declared war on police in a manifesto after being fired by the LAPD in 2009 and losing appeals to be reinstated, claiming that racism in the police department was behind him losing his job.","""I have a very high standard for the application of deadly force,"" police chief Charlie Beck says .

"Muslims throughout the world have been marking Eid al-Adha, but in war-torn Syria there is little to celebrate as most people struggle to meet their basic needs: food, water, and shelter. Their plight has been highlighted by Arabic media reports that cite a fatwa, or religious ruling, by a local imam that allows people who are desperately hungry to eat dogs and cats. Eating dog, cat or donkey is forbidden under Islamic dietary laws. The imam in the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp in the capital, Damascus, reportedly said at a mosque Friday that dog, cat and donkey meat could be eaten ""after reaching a desperate need and the stores of food were inadequate to feed the population under the siege."" Yarmouk has been besieged for months by Syrian government forces seeking to flush out rebel fighters. During the Eid al-Adha holiday, one of Islam's most revered observances, Muslims around the world sacrifice sheep and share the meat with the poor. It corresponds with the height of the Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia that annually draws 2 million Muslims. A YouTube video purports to show a group of religious leaders outside Damascus issuing a fatwa permitting the eating of cats, kittens, donkeys, and animals killed in shelling. The man reading the statement appeals to the world, and particularly to Muslims who are completing the Hajj pilgrimage, to think of the Syrian children ""dying of hunger"" while the viewers' stomachs are full. ""How can't they just stand for us, for our children?"" the sheikh asks. ""Do they want us to get to the point when we are forced to eat the flesh of our dead martyrs and our beloved just to survive?"" CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the video. Syria's war: CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reflects on front line reports . 'We are living in despair' At the Atmeh refugee camp in Idlib province in northern Syria, some refugees set up improvised vendor stands for the celebration -- but drew few customers who could afford their goods. ""Before the crisis, during Eid, we used to go to the shops and buy items, we were happy,"" said Suad Zein. ""Eid was a wonderful holiday here. Now these days I can't even buy my boy a pair of trousers, or shoes, or even a loaf of bread. ""I have eight children. I can't support them all. We are living in despair."" Said another: ""We have nothing to celebrate. We used to celebrate with food, drink, desserts. We used to make pastries. ... Now there's nothing."" Some refugees in Aleppo, Syria, were more fortunate. A benefactor donated sheep for the traditional animal sacrifice, which were to be slaughtered and distributed among families in need, a man in charge of the slaughter said. The U.N. food agency, the World Food Programme, warned last month that the violence in Syria was making it hard to get aid to those in need. It estimated that 4 million people in the country were unable to produce or buy enough food. Eid al-Adha commemorates when God appeared in a dream to Abraham -- known as Ibrahim to Muslims --  and asked him to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience. As Abraham was about to perform the sacrifice, God stopped him and gave him a sheep to kill in place of his son. Versions of the story also appear in the Torah and in the Bible's Old Testament. The four-day celebration is also known as the Feast of Sacrifice, or Greater Eid. It is the longer of two Eid holidays observed by Muslims. Eid al-Fitr, or Little Eid, follows the holy month of Ramadan. Asma al-Assad makes rare appearance . A rare interview with Asma al-Assad, wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, aired Tuesday on Syrian state TV, showing her as she visited the Daughters of Martyrs' school in Damascus. The first lady, wearing a gray sweater with the Syrian flag in the center, is shown being greeted with  applause from dozens of Syrian girls and planting olive trees with them. The olive tree is a symbol of giving and peace, she says, as well as ""a symbol of life and endurance, those who sacrificed and are sacrificing for this homeland are doing that for us so we can live and prosper in this land."" The interviewer asks Asma al-Assad, who lived in Britain before her marriage to Syria's president, about past rumors that she had left the war-torn country for Russia, Lebanon or Britain. Smiling, she replies, ""I am here, I exist here. My husband and my children are present here in Syria. It is quite rational for me to be here with them. And just like the majority of the Syrians, I was raised to love the homeland and I grew up with that notion that wherever I'd travel or lived before, and no matter how long people stay away, there is nothing more precious than the homeland."" The first lady has also been a star of the recently established Instagram account of the Syrian presidency, where she is seen smiling, showing off her volunteer work and attending social events with her husband. Activists: Truck carrying civilians hit . Syria's descent into civil war began in March 2011, when Bashar al-Assad's regime cracked down on peaceful anti-government protesters. That conflict spiraled into an armed uprising and a crisis that the United Nations says has claimed more than 100,000 lives. On Wednesday, at least 53 people -- including 13 children and four women -- were killed nationwide, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported. Four children and six women were among the fatalities in a blast in Daraa, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. At least 21 people died when their truck was hit by an explosive device in southern Syria, opposition activists said. The truck carrying civilians was hit as it passed through an area controlled by troops loyal to the Syrian government, the group said. Government officials did not immediately respond to the allegation. Two suicide bombers from the al Qaeda-linked Jabhat al-Nusra rebel group detonated themselves Wednesday afternoon inside the gates of Aleppo Central Prison, killing seven regime forces, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Meanwhile, the Turkish army has reinforced its positions near a strategic border gate between Turkey and opposition-controlled northern Syria, where ISIS fighters have been active. Last month, ISIS fighters pushed more moderate Syrian rebels out of the nearby Syrian town of Azaz. Weapons inspectors . As the war rages, international inspectors continue their mission to inventory and eliminate Syria's chemical weapons arsenal. Experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, supported by the United Nations, have conducted verification activities at 11 sites identified by Syrian authorities, the OPCW said Wednesday. They have overseen the destruction of ""critical equipment"" at six sites, as well as the destruction of some unloaded chemical weapons munitions, it said. On Monday, Syria became bound by the international treaty banning chemical arms, the Chemical Weapons Convention, which is implemented by the OPCW. A team of OPCW inspectors entered the country on October 1. The joint mission is tasked by a U.N. Security Council resolution with ridding the country of chemical weapons by mid-2014.","A fatwa has reportedly been issued allowing those starving in Syria to eat cats and dogs .

"Health officials have added 45 infants to the list of more than 700 who were exposed to tuberculosis at a hospital in El Paso, Texas. Earlier this week, the city's Department of Public Health announced that 706 infants and 43 health care workers had been exposed to tuberculosis, commonly called TB, at Providence Memorial Hospital. An employee at the hospital came to work with an active case of TB some time between September 2013 and August 2014. He or she worked with infants in the nursery and in the post-partum unit at the hospital, the health department said. These 45 additional cases were exposed during the same time period, and are being notified along with the rest of the group. The family of each patient was sent a certified letter and is being contacted via telephone with instructions on how to get tested for TB. Any necessary follow-up care will be provided free of charge by the health department and the hospital. As of Monday, more than 350 appointments had been made for screenings, according to the health department. Parents and other family members of the infants are not being told to get tested because they ""are not considered exposed,"" health officials said in a statement. There is no word yet on whether any of the people exposed have tested positive for the disease. The infected health care worker is no longer working and is receiving treatment, the owner of the hospital, Sierra Providence Health Network, said in a statement. Tuberculosis is an infectious disease that generally causes coughing, chest pain and difficulty breathing, according to the Mayo Clinic. An estimated 2 billion people worldwide have what's called latent TB, where the bacteria remain dormant and don't cause symptoms. ""Once in the body, the bacteria usually lay dormant for months or years before they begin to grow and cause a case of active TB,"" the El Paso Department of Public Health said in a statement. ""That is why it is so important to identify people who may have been exposed, screen them, and provide treatment."" The bacteria that cause TB spread through the air when an infected patient coughs or sneezes, but it's not a highly contagious disease; close contact over a longer period of time is required before another person becomes infected, according to the Mayo Clinic. Only active TB can be spread. The Texas Department of State Health Services conducted an on-site investigation at Providence Memorial Hospital last week and cited the hospital ""for deficiencies that represent immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety,"" said Carrie Williams, the department's director of media relations. Investigators ""found serious deficiencies in the areas of infection control, patient rights and governing body."" The Center for Medicare Services has placed the hospital on a termination track, said David Wright, deputy regional administrator for CMS in Dallas. He said CMS is giving the hospital until October 11 to identify policy changes that need to happen to ensure something like this won't happen again. If the hospital fails to do so, its Medicaid and Medicare funding will be cut off. ""This is one of the largest TB exposure investigations we've ever been involved in, and it involves infants, so it is particularly sensitive,"" Williams said. ""Babies are more likely than older children and adults to develop life-threatening forms of TB."" Patients with TB must take antibiotics for six to nine months. Some strains of TB are resistant to antibiotics, which makes them more dangerous. Without treatment, TB can be fatal, the Mayo Clinic says. There is one vaccine for TB -- Bacille Calmette-Guerin, known as BCG -- that is not widely used in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; it is given more often to children in countries where TB is common. There were 9,582 recorded cases of TB in the United States last year. In October, health officials identified 140 infants who may have been exposed to tuberculosis in a similar incident at a hospital in Nevada.","751 infants and 43 health care workers have been exposed to TB .

"By nearly all accounts, 12-year-old Kali Hardig should not be alive. During a swim at a water park in July, she contracted parasitic meningitis, a rare infection caused by brain-eating amoebas that has a survival rate less than 1%. Only two patients had been known to survive in the last half-century. But Kali is a fighter and, against all odds, she made it. Wednesday, after nearly seven weeks, she finally left the hospital. ""It's awesome to be home,"" Kali told CNN's Kate Bolduan on ""New Day"" Thursday morning. Kali can take a few steps on her own, and she's been undergoing rehab. On Monday morning, she'll reach another milestone: she'll head back to school part-time. She'll be in class in the morning, and in physical and speech therapy in the afternoons. ""I was determined that I wasn't going to lose her,"" Kali's mom, Traci Hardig, told Bolduan. ""I'm so thankful and blessed... it's just a miracle."" Uncharted territory . Soon after entering the  Arkansas Children's Hospital earlier this summer, Kali was in critical condition; she was unresponsive and unable to breathe without the assistance of a breathing tube. Kali's doctors have been in virtually uncharted territory as they treat her for the rare amoeba, called Naegleria fowleri. Of 128 known cases in the past half-century, just two patients have survived, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""We decided that we were just going to tell (Kali) she was very sick, and she had to fight like Mom does because Mom has been battling cancer,"" Traci said. ""And then we were going to ask everybody to pray for her."" Dr. Sanjiv Pasala, one of Kali's attending physicians, said doctors immediately started treating her with an anti-fungal medicine, antibiotics and a new experimental anti-amoeba drug doctors got directly from the CDC. They also reduced the girl's body temperature to 93 degrees. Doctors have used that technique in some brain injury cases to preserve undamaged brain tissue. Two weeks ago, doctors checked the girl's cerebral spinal fluid and could not find any presence of the amoeba. Pasala said that while other cases have not met with such favorable results, what may have made a real difference is that Kali's mother got her to the hospital so quickly. ""It was a long haul. We were in ICU for 22 days,"" Traci said. ""It was like riding a rollercoaster -- I mean, one moment things would be going good, and then the next moment something else could happen."" 'Death within one to 12 days' Kali is one of two 12-year-olds who recently contracted the amoeba. Zachary Reyna of Florida died last month of the parasite, even after receiving the same experimental drug that was given to Kali. He contracted the amoeba after kneeboarding in a water-filled ditch by his house August 3, his family told CNN affiliate WBBH. Naegleria fowleri is found in hot springs and warm fresh water, most often in the southeastern United States. Between 2001 and 2010, there were 32 reported cases in the United States, the CDC says. Most of the cases were in the Southeast. The amoeba enters the body through the nose and travels to the brain. You cannot be infected with the organism by drinking contaminated water, the CDC says. The first symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis appear one to seven days after infection, including headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and a stiff neck, according to the CDC. ""Later symptoms include confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations,"" the government agency's website states. ""After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within one to 12 days."" Why 'nightmare bacteria' on the rise . 'One of the most severe infections' Willow Springs Water Park in Little Rock is the most likely source of Kali's infection, according to a news release from the Arkansas Department of Health. Another case of the same infection, also called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, was reported in 2010 and was possibly linked to Willow Springs. ""Based on the occurrence of two cases of this rare infection in association with the same body of water and the unique features of the park, the ADH has asked the owner of Willow Springs to voluntarily close the water park to ensure the health and safety of the public,"" the news release said. What's in your pool water? Dr. Dirk Haselow of the Arkansas Department of Health told CNN affiliate WMC that Kali's case was ""one of the most severe infections that we know of."" ""Ninety-nine percent of people who get it die,"" Haselow said. But not Kali. She wasn't about to give up that easily. ""Thank you for praying for me, everybody,"" she said on ""New Day."" Traci has a message for parents out there who might be wondering how they can keep their children safe against this microscopic amoeba. ""If you believe that there's something more wrong with your daughter or your son than a simple virus or stomach flu, stay in there, hang in there. Talk to the doctor... and reassure them that this is not a normal illness.""","Only two patients had been known to survive in the last half-century.
""I've been in the hospital a long time,"" she says .
Amoeba causes brain infection, nearly always fatal, according to the CDC .
Parasite generally found in people who swim in warm fresh water ."
"An Indian author whose memoir about her dramatic escape from the Taliban became a Bollywood movie was shot dead by militants in Afghanistan, police said Thursday. Sushmita Banerjee, also known as Sushmita Bandhopadhya, was killed outside her home in Paktika province, according to Dawlat Khan Zadran, the police chief of eastern Paktika province. He said suspected Taliban insurgents broke into her house Wednesday night, blindfolded and tied up her husband, and fled with Banerjee. Her body was found Thursday, dumped outside a madrasa, or religious school, in the outskirts of Sharana city, the provincial capital. ""She had around 20 bullet holes in her body,"" Zadran said. Banerjee gained attention with her 1995 book, ""A Kabuliwala's Bengali Wife."" It recounts her story of marrying for love and moving to Afghanistan in 1989 to be with her husband. It traces her life in Afghanistan, her harassment by the Taliban and her eventual journey back to India. She wrote an article for India's Outlook magazine in 1998, about her life in Afghanistan, which she describes as tolerable until the Taliban crackdown in 1993. ""I remember it was early that year that members of the Taliban came to our house,"" she wrote in Outlook. ""They had heard of the dispensary I was running from my house. I am not a qualified doctor. But I knew a little about common ailments, and since there was no medical help in the vicinity, I thought I could support myself and keep myself busy by dispensing medicines. The members of the Taliban who called on us were aghast that I, a woman, could be running a business establishment. They ordered me to close down the dispensary and branded me a woman of poor morals. ""They also listed out do's and don'ts. The burkha was a necessity. Listening to the radio or playing a tape recorder was banned. Women were not allowed to go to shops. They were even prohibited from stepping out from their houses unless accompanied by their husbands. All women had to have the names of their husbands tattooed on their left hand. Virtually all interaction between men and women outside the confines of their own homes was banned."" In 2003, her book was made into a Bollywood film, ""Escape from Taliban."" Bollywood movies are extremely popular in Afghanistan. Banerjee, 49, had recently moved to Paktika province to live with her husband, Afghan businessman Jaanbaz Khan, police said. She was a health worker who helped women in an area that had very few female health professionals, police said. Banerjee could have been targeted for many reasons, including for her book, the movie, her health work, or even the fact that she was an Indian woman, Zadran said. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. In a 2003 interview with rediff.com, a Mumbai-based website, she said she hoped her life story would make people ""aware of the conditions women in Afghanistan live under."" ""One day,"" she added, ""I am going to go back and free them.""","Sushmita Banerjee was kidnapped and killed in Afghanistan, police say .

"Gunmen opened fire at buses carrying students and soccer players in southern Mexico. It's been more than a week since that violent night of shootouts in Iguala, Mexico. Authorities say three students were among six people killed in the September 26 violence, and 43 students remain missing. Where are they? Authorities and witnesses fear they may be close to unraveling the mystery. Along a dirt road in a remote part of Mexico's Guerrero state, authorities turned up unmarked graves full of human remains on Saturday. Investigators found the remains of at least 28 people inside the graves, Guerrero State Attorney General Iñaky Blanco Cabrera told reporters Sunday. The bodies were covered in gasoline and burned before they were buried, he said, and it could take between two weeks and two months to identify them. A tip from suspects detained after the shootouts led them to the grave sites, authorities said. The missing students, who were studying to become school teachers at Escuela Normal Rural de Ayotzinapa, were mostly young men in their 20s, according to a website state government officials have set up to help in the search. ""Help us find them!"" the website says, offering a reward of 1 million pesos ($74,000) for information leading to the missing students. State officials, who've faced sharp criticism over the students' disappearance, released a statement Sunday detailing their investigative efforts. So far more than 30 people have been detained, including 22 local police officers. The police have denied attacking anyone, according to a government statement on their detention. But protesters from the school have said officials aren't doing enough. ""NOW IT IS MORE DANGEROUS TO BE A STUDENT THAN A CRIMINAL,"" one post on a Facebook page dedicated to the school said. Witnesses have accused police of orchestrating and participating in the shootings. ""The goal of the police was to kill any person that was inside the perimeter they had,"" one student from the school told CNN en Español. Guerrero state Gov. Angel Aguirre has defended his government's response and called for calm in the face of protests. ""To the family and friends of those who were savagely massacred, I offer all my solidarity and support,"" he said in a series of Twitter post Saturday. ""It would be highly condemnable, those who want to take advantage or politically profit from a situation like the one that today overwhelms and saddens us."" A bus carrying members of the third division Chilpancingo Hornets soccer club was also among those ambushed in what authorities described as three attacks on September 26. A 15-year-old player on the team was killed. Omar Sanchez, one of his teammates, described the ambush to CNN en Español. ""We were just watching a movie and we saw the bullets come in and then it was like we were going off a cliff and the bus tipped over. And it was then that they started firing at us with machine guns,"" he said. ""It sounded so ugly, the gunshots and my teammates screaming, 'Help, leave us alone, we are injured.' A teacher said, 'you have already blinded me, please, we are the team from Chilpancingo."" The armed men said they weren't going anywhere, ordering the team to open the door. ""Now you are going to be taken, we are going to kill all of you,"" the gunmen said, according to Sanchez. When the teacher refused to open the door, Sanchez said, the men opened fire again. The case has left many troubling questions unanswered. Key among them: Who gave the orders to open fire, and what was their motive? State prosecutors first said last week that the violence started after the college students commandeered three buses, and city police opened fire. Since then, evidence has tied the Guerreros Unidos criminal group, and police connected with them, to the shooting and the students' disappearance, Blanco told reporters Saturday. In 2013: 54 bodies found in mass graves in Mexico . For years Guerrero state, which includes Iguala and the well-known resort city of Acapulco, has ranked among the Mexican states with the highest homicide rates, a crime statistic regularly used by officials and analysts when discussing the overall security situation. Figures released by Mexico's National Statistics and Geography Institute last year painted a grim picture of kidnapping throughout the country. A survey revealed that there were more than 105,000 kidnappings nationwide in 2012, the institute said, but only about 1,300 of them were reported to authorities.","The remains of at least 28 people were inside mass graves, an official says .

"Downtown Kiev was aglow in fire early Wednesday, as demonstrators undeterred by a bloody day on the streets staked their claim to the heart of the Ukrainian capital and, they hope, the heart of the country itself. Such flames have been a constant for three months, acting as fiery barricades all around Kiev's Maidan, or Independence Square, for protesters. Yet the flames grew more ominous on Tuesday as at least 21 people died in fresh clashes between government forces and activists. What began with protests over President Viktor Yanukovych's backpedaling from a trade pact with the European Union -- a move that the opposition maligned, accusing Yanukovych of trying to cozy up to Russia rather than the West -- has spawned into something much larger. In addition to new elections, the opposition is calling for constitutional reforms to transfer more power from the presidency to the parliament. Yanukovych and his allies have responded with some concessions, even offering places in government to opposition leaders. But on-again, off-again talks have gone nowhere, with the opposition refusing to budge politically and from its positions in the center of Kiev. None of that changed after a face-to-face meeting overnight between Yanukovych and opposition leader Vitali Klitschko. Speaking to reporters afterward, Klitschko said there effectively was ""no discussion."" According to his Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms party, the president demanded protesters ""stop the standoff"" and put down their weapons -- an accusation that Klitschko claimed is unfounded. ""I think the authorities should immediately pull back the police and stop the blood, because people are dying,"" Klitschko said. ""I told Yanukovich this. How can we negotiate when there is blood being spilled? Unfortunately, he does not understand it."" What's behind Ukraine's political crisis? Deadliest day of political unrest . Tuesday's violence followed what seemed like a rare breakthrough. Protesters pulled back Sunday from Kiev's City Hall and unlocked streets in the city center after the government said it'd drop charges against those arrested in the political unrest. Then everything fell apart Tuesday. The speaker of parliament's refusal to allow amendments that would limit the president's powers and restore the constitution to what it was in 2004 angered many in the opposition. The government's prosecutor general, meanwhile, accused the opposition of breaking ""the truce"" and, therefore, setting the stage for the crackdown. ""For the sake of pursuing their own political interests, they neglected all previously reached agreements and put lives and the peace of millions of Kiev residents under threat,"" said Viktor Pshonka, Ukraine's prosecutor general. Whoever was to blame, there was no dispute Tuesday was the deadliest day -- by far -- in the political unrest. Riot police used water cannons, stun grenades and other means to force their way through protesters, with video showing some of them toting shields and swinging sticks as they barreled through. Some demonstrators fought back, swinging what looked like baseball bats or using other means. Protesters also set fire to the headquarters of the ruling Party of Regions. Authorities accused them of firing guns at security forces. A CNN employee at the scene saw demonstrators carrying pellet guns, though not with live ammunition. One video showed an armored personnel carrier charging toward demonstrators barricades, only to be inundated by a flurry of what appeared to be Molotov cocktails. The vehicle then burst into flames. All the moving parts, different tactics and raw emotions contributed to a violent, chaotic melee in the center of Ukraine's capital. Officials warned people to stay indoors and shuttered metro stations to help control the situation. The situation hardly calmed as night descended. Black smoke and bright flames from burning tires continued to rage around Independence Square, just a few blocks from parliament. Small explosions regularly erupted all night -- the product of protesters' fireworks and, perhaps, the stun grenades that police have been using to clear the crowds. Demonstrators also worked through the night to build up their barricades, by forming human chains to pass bricks, rocks and wood up their front lines in anticipation of another police offensive. Ukrainian security forces did indeed move forward, despite a barrage of rocks, before halting their advance -- for now, at least. Kiev was the center of the action, just like it has been all winter, with nine police officers, 11 protesters and an employee from the ruling party's headquarters among those killed, according to officials. But it wasn't just the capital. Police confirmed the unrest has spread to western Ukraine, with protesters attacking police and local government offices in a number of regions. Blame game, calls for restraint . Pshonka, Ukraine's prosecutor general, blamed protesters for the violence that he said that -- in addition to those killed -- injured at least 100 others. The organizers of a rally Tuesday that descended into violence will be held accountable ""for every single person injured, every car burned and every window broken,"" he said. ""Today, we were able to see that only the government is interested in peaceful resolution of the situation,"" Pshonka said. ""Opposition leaders should take the responsibility for everything happening in the street of Kiev today."" Opposition leaders painted their supporters as the victims, not the aggressors. Klitschko, a former world class boxer turned politician, accused police of ""cruelly shooting at people in central Kiev."" And Arseniy Yatsenyuk -- an opposition leader from a party other than Klitschko's -- made a public appeal to Yanukovych: ""Do not let Ukraine become a country covered with blood. Pull back the police and announce a cease-fire. Then we will negotiate."" U.S. Vice President Joe Biden himself pressed Yanukovych in a phone call, with the White House saying ""the government bears special responsibility to de-escalate the situation."" Secretary of State John Kerry later backed up the Vice President's words. He called for the Ukrainian government to halt violence immediately, and reopen dialogue with the opposition. Kerry: United States, EU stand with Ukraine's people . On the flip side, Russia's state-run RIA Novosti's story on the latest Kiev unrest noted Moscow's persistent support for Yanukovych and its accusation -- made earlier this week from foreign ministry spokesman  Alexander Lukashevich -- that Washington is trying to tell ""the authorities of a sovereign state what they should do next and how they should do it."" Such international back-and-forth is especially significant in the Ukraine, given not only its geographic and political position betwixt Europe and Russia and the origins of the latest unrest. It began in November with Yanukovych's decision to scuttle an European Union trade pact that the opposition hoped would bring the Ukraine closer to the West, and improve its economy in the process. The next month, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would buy $15 billion in Ukrainian debt and slash the price Kiev pays for its gas. As the months rolled on, the conflict expanded beyond the long-simmering discord over whether Ukraine should align more with the West or with Russia. The opposition has pressed to change how the Eastern European nation's government operates, namely through constitutional and other reforms that would -- among other things -- shift powers away from its president and toward parliament.

"Stretching across the heart of Europe, Germany's spider-web of highways ferries tons of goods on their journey across the continent and beyond. The country is a strategic transport gateway between east and west, with four million trucks racing down its roads day and night, helping to keep its industrial economy ticking. But with road transport accounting for about one-fifth of the EU's total emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, there is a pressing need to find cleaner ways of hauling cargo. Enter eHighway -- a bold new idea to adapt existing technology behind tram lines to electrify trucks on the highway. The project is currently taking shape in the workshops of German electrical giant Siemens, and scientists hope it will eventually enable trucks to drive almost emission free. ""Right now we only have electro mobility for cars, and with this project we want to develop the technology to drive trucks electrically,"" says Michael Lehmann, the technical project manager of the initiative. Adapting systems . The technology is being tested at a former Soviet airbase near Berlin, and centers on hybrid trucks. These are fed electricity from powerlines, which are dotted along the road, through a so-called pantograph. The device, which is more commonly used for trams, is mounted on the truck's roof, and plays a crucial part in the operation. ""It needs to work even if you have to brake quickly or if you suddenly have to leave the lane. Those are all the small steps, but they are necessary to make it work,"" says Lehmann. Trucks are not limited to one lane only -- they can overtake one another by detaching from the power lines when the driver blinks, and then can return to position by lifting the pantograph back up to the cables when the process is complete. Lehman says that this automation could be applied beyond the highways. ""Whenever you have trucks driving the same route shuttling goods back and forth all day, that is where we want to use this technology."" he explains. ""So, also in logistic centers in ports and mining applications as well,"" adds Lehman. Going green . The European Commission estimates that by 2050 freight transport in the EU will increase by 80%, and experts stress that moving cargo has to become more environmentally-friendly. ""If we want to achieve our climate emission targets we have to think about alternative drive trains, hybridization, but also of course substitutes, so we would try to shift a lot more towards trains,"" says Jens Weinmann, of the European School of Management and Technology. With that in mind, the eHighway project seeks to combine the efficiency of rail transport with the flexibility of trucks. Trials are set to move from the test area near Berlin to a public road in the U.S. next year, and in time, engineers hope this technology could amp the green credentials of logistics around the world.

"A mob of people have surrounded a group of animal rights activists protesting in the busiest open market in town. It's the eve of Yulin's annual dog meat festival, a tradition that dates back generations to celebrate the summer solstice. Arguments ensue among those living in the city and the people who condemn the tradition. ""Don't you eat beef? If you stop eating beef, then we'll stop eating dog meat,"" yells one man frustrated with the intense media scrutiny in the Dong Kou open market, where an array of birds, snakes, cats and livestock are sold as daily fresh fare. Dozens of journalists, filmmakers and photographers have come to the city in China's southeast Guangxi province to document an event that lies at the center of a battle between deeply-ingrained tradition and the encroachment of the modern world. Activists say dogs are part of the daily diet here, with an estimated 10,000 dogs killed for the festival alone. Ask a local when the tradition of eating dog meat began and you'll likely be met with a dumbfounded expression -- it is akin to asking someone when people started eating beef. For many in the city, eating dog meat is a hard habit to break, despite changing attitudes about the treatment of animals in China. Rising prices . Another man at the market criticizes the media attention for increasing the price of dog meat, which has doubled since 2011 and now goes for $6 a kilogram. In one stall, a butcher places a gutted and skinned dog on a wired sheath and uses a blow torch to cook a delicacy known to locals as ""crispy skin dog meat."" As the shop owner butchers a another piece of dog, flecks of flesh flick onto her face. She tells CNN she's been in the trade for over 10 years. ""This is our tradition and we are used to eating dog. It's our culture and we won't change ... It's tasty! But we won't kill our pet,"" she says, referring to her own dog who is cowering in the other side of the shop. Her dog tucks his head under a freezer, shielding his eyes from the carcasses of the dogs and cats hanging from hooks. Signs around the market adorned with pictures of labradors and golden retrievers advertise raw dog meat for sale, despite new government regulations that restrict this practice. Du Yufeng, a 58-year-old animal rights activists from Sichuan in southwest China, has made it her mission to stop dog meat consumption across China. Her protest in 2011 successfully ended the dog meat festival in Jinhua, in Zhejiang province -- and she has now turned her attention to Yulin. It's her fourth year protesting at the festival, and while dog meat continues to be a tourist attraction for the city, Du feels that there is growing awareness of animal rights in this city of six million people. ""I feel like we've had a lot of improvement in public awareness. The first time we came here in 2011 all you could hear were dogs wailing as soon as you entered into the city,"" Du says, as she picks off ticks from the scruff of a black dog she rescued that morning. ""The biggest change is that the word dog on street signs have to be covered. This means the government has become aware that this needs to be canceled. Many people also realize that eating dog is not an honorable thing,"" adds Du. Boycott . Du is one of over 20 volunteers who have descended upon the city from the far reaches of China, to boycott the festival. Many run dog and cat shelters in their hometowns and have spent their life savings to rescue abandoned and diseased animals. But canceling the annual Yulin festival is now their main objective. Another activist, Zhao Yangsu, said this is her first year protesting against the Yulin dog meat festival. The soft spoken 59-year old, who came to the city from Chongqing, says she's spent her retirement money, roughly $1,000, to save dogs -- a fact she's reluctant to share with her children. She and another volunteer operate from makeshift shelter on the corner of a street in Yulin, only a block from where live dogs are traded on a daily basis. Though she has come here to fight for the rights of these animals, she's pessimistic about any meaningful change here. ""I have no hope that these people will change and our ability to make change is not significant enough,"" Zhao says. ""We have to go through the government to create some laws to protect these animals, but there are no laws and our ability to do anything is insignificant."" Yang Yuhua, a 64-year-old retired steel worker, has also spent her life savings protecting street dogs and cats in Chongqing, and now she says she doesn't even have money to charge her phone. Yang was cradling a dead puppy when CNN arrived at the makeshift shelter. She says the puppy was born after they had rescued a pregnant dog and this one did not make it. Almost all the dogs appeared injured, disfigured and diseased. ""What we need the most now is medicine, but it's the most expensive thing,"" Yang says as as she tears up. Many of the dogs in her care are in desperate need of antibiotics to fight off infection, but the volunteers don't know where to find them in the city. Together, the activists say they've saved more than 400 dogs this year alone in Yulin -- yet this number will be dwarfed by the number of animals likely to be slaughtered for food at the festival. Asked what makes this different from eating beef or pork, Du Yunfeng's answer is unequivocal. ""You cannot categorically say that all animals should either be eaten or not eaten,"" she says. ""Every animal has their its own value and worth. For example, grass-eating animals are meant to be supplied to humans. But these companion animals, such as dogs and cats, they are meant to contribute to human production -- such as drug-sniffing dogs or watch dogs, . ""So eating these animals compared to eating pork and lamb are two different things. Their value is not the same."" Smugglers drive Thailand's grim trade in dog meat .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A judge in Fulton County, Georgia, sentenced a woman to 36 years in prison Thursday for her role in an Easter Sunday car wreck last year that left five people dead, and for her subsequent role in trying to cover it up. Aimee Michael sat expressionless as her sentence was read -- guilty of homicide by vehicle in the first degree, serious injury by vehicle, hit and run, reckless driving, failure to maintain lane and tampering with evidence. She also received 14 years' probation and was ordered not to operate a motor vehicle and to surrender her driver's license. Michael's mother, Sheila Michael, was sentenced to eight years for tampering with evidence and hindering her daughter's apprehension. ""I know, at 22, there are things that many of us have done in this  courtroom that we may not be proud of, decisions we may have made,""  Superior Court Judge Kimberly M. Esmond Adams, her voice quavering, told  defendant Aimee Michael. ""But this is, for me, from all my days as a  prosecutor, from the time that I have spent on the bench, the hardest  case I have ever dealt with."" Addressing the elder defendant, Adams said, ""As a result of your failure to act as a mother should, your life and the life of your daughter, unfortunately, will be changed forever."" The incident occurred April 12, 2009, when Aimee Michael lost control of her BMW as she was driving in southwest Atlanta to buy ice cream at a grocery store, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Her car hit a Mercedes, which slammed into a Volkswagen Beetle. All four occupants of the Mercedes -- Robert Carter, his wife, Delisia Carter, their infant son Ethan Carter, and Kayla Lemons, Delisia Carter's 9-year-old daughter -- were killed, the newspaper reported. Morgan Johnson, who was 6 years old, died in the Volkswagen. Ten days passed before police, acting on a tip, found Michael's newly repaired BMW in her family's driveway in south Fulton County. In court, both women -- dressed in blue prison jumpsuits -- offered tearful apologies. ""I have wronged three families, and for that I am sorry,"" Aimee Michael said, her voice cracking. ""I apologize to the Carter family and I apologize to the Johnson family ... Not a day goes by that I don't pray for your comfort and your peace and your healing. ... I want to apologize to my family and to my mother and my father and everybody that I've let down, and I pray that God forgives me."" Said Sheila Michael: ""To all the families, I'm very sorry ... my prayer for you each day is that your sorrow be comforted in His loving arms."" Robert Carter's mother and sister, Sherry Fain and Tomeika Fain, told HLN's ""Prime News"" they were unmoved by the Michaels' apologies. ""There's nothing that they can say to ease the pain and the hurt that I feel of losing my child, my firstborn and his only child, that was Robert's only child he had -- little Ethan,"" said Sherry Fain. ""Even if she had come back or turned herself in to the police -- but to repair the car? No, they have no remorse. They don't."" Tomeika Fain said Aimee Michael should have received a longer sentence. ""My brother, he died a horrific death -- he and his family,"" she said. ""She had no remorse, to me. She was just worried about herself."" She said Thursday's comments in court by the Michaels were the first she had heard from either woman, adding that she would like to hear more details. ""I want to know what happened,"" Tomeika Fain said. ""Were you on the phone, were you texting, were you smoking?"" At the courthouse, Morgan Johnson's mother, Tracie Johnson, who was badly injured herself, told a reporter she has no hate for the Michaels. ""Each and every day, I am reminded by that accident on Easter Sunday, whether it is physical pain or emotional pain,"" she said. ""I just want the defendants to know that I pray for them.""

"(CNN) -- Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a bill late Monday that would have required President Barack Obama and other presidential candidates to prove they were American citizens, born in the United States, before their names could have been placed on the state ballot. The so-called ""birther bill"" got final approval in the state House last week. Now that Brewer, a Republican, has vetoed it, the bill will not become law unless legislators vote to override her veto. ""As a former Secretary of State, I do not support designating one person as a gatekeeper to the ballot for a candidate, which could lead to arbitrary or politically-motivated decisions,"" the governor wrote in a letter addressed to the Arizona House speaker. Under the measure, if there were any dispute about whether a candidate had proved he or she had been born in the United States, Arizona's secretary of state would have the final say. ""This measure creates significant new problems while failing to do anything constructive for Arizona,"" she added. Obama has been hounded by allegations since he began running for president in 2008 that he was not born in America. Critics contend, among other things, that he was born in his father's home country of Kenya. The U.S. Constitution stipulates that only ""natural born"" citizens are eligible to be president. Obama has insisted that he was born in Hawaii, and the allegations against him have been repeatedly discredited in investigations by CNN and other organizations. Nevertheless, the issue remains politically potent among segments of the electorate and has served as a rallying cry for many of the president's opponents, most recently potential GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. William Bennett's take on Donald Trump . The author of the so-called ""birther bill,"" Arizona State Rep. Carl Seel, has said the bill was not targeted at Obama, but at ""maintaining the integrity of the Constitution."" Among other things, a candidate would have to show a copy of his or her birth certificate. If a birth certificate couldn't be produced, a candidate would have to show a combination of baptismal or circumcision records, hospital birth files, postpartum medical records or other documents. Candidates also would have to submit affidavits declaring their citizenship as well as sworn statements regarding their residency for the previous 14 years. ""I never imagined being presented with a bill that could require candidates for President of the greatest and most powerful nation on earth to submit their 'early baptismal or circumcision certificates' among other records to the Arizona Secretary of State.

Both the current Hawaii governor, Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat, and the previous governor, Linda Lingle, a Republican, have insisted that Obama was born in their home state. Nearly 75% of Americans believe Obama was definitely or probably born in the United States, according to a March 11-13 CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll. More than four in 10 Republicans, however, believe the president probably or definitely was not born in America.","Gov. Jan Brewer says the bill is ""a bridge too far""

"Years before Karolyne Smith sold Golden Palace Casino ad space on her forehead for $10,000, and long before an image of the Virgin Mary was toasted into the buttery crust of a grilled cheese sandwich and hocked for $28,000, there was a little family in a little town in Michigan that imprinted their names onto the awkward pages of eBay infamy with another strange sale. That family is mine. Just about everyone in my hometown of Rochester Hills knew Madonna had grown up there, but I would guess there weren't too many who could point out which house had been hers. That is, until we bought it and put it on national TV. It all started when I returned home from college after my freshman year to find my newfound freedom again weighed down by daily parental oversight. It was that awkward juncture between childhood and adulthood, and one muttered phrase to my dad -- ""Did you know Madonna's house is for sale? You should buy it and put it on eBay"" -- sent us down a path that would become the story of something much bigger than us, even bigger than one of the world's most famous celebrities. My older brother Matt almost never tells the story. It was my dad's money of course, but in his mid-20s, Matt became the face of it all because my dad doesn't love attention and youth sells. He and my father have decidedly different takes on the whole ordeal. My brother says he's embarrassed at the outcome and disappointed that in some circles he may always be known for this one stupid thing. My dad chalks it up to a ""great learning experience and a lot of fun."" It was a 30-day auction that just happened to bookend one of the biggest events in U.S. history. At the time, eBay was a relatively new phenomenon, and celebrity worship was at an all-time high. When you watch this video, you may judge us harshly, but I want to share this story because I believe it says a striking amount about one of the starkest cultural shifts our country has ever experienced. It's perhaps the least important story you'll ever see on the subject, but I hope you'll find it interesting, because I had to beg to get my family to tell it again.

"(CNN) -- As a teenager, Roger Pontz's eyesight began to fail. Doctors told him there was nothing they could do to save his vision and over the years his sight deteriorated until, by the age of 40, he was completely blind. Pontz had been diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a hereditary eye disease that damages the retina -- a layer of tissue at the back of the eye that converts light to nerve signals and sends them to the brain. But he always believed that one day he would see again. A few years ago he heard about a device called the Argus II. Known as the ""bionic eye,"" it gave a glimmer of hope that some of his sight might be restored. ""At that time it was all experimental,"" recalls Pontz, ""so I just kept waiting and kept waiting and thought someday it would happen, because you have to believe in yourself."" The Argus II system consists of a pair of glasses with a small video camera mounted on it, which captures images. A prosthesis no larger than a pencil eraser is surgically implanted on the surface of the retina and information from the camera is transmitted wirelessly to electrodes on the artificial retina, where it is converted to electrical pulses. Any remaining cells that haven't been damaged by the eye disease are stimulated by the pulses, leading to a perception of light patterns in the brain. It's a long way from perfect vision -- the users perceives simple flashes of light, no color or details -- but it can be enough to get around. The Argus II has been used in Europe since 2011 in countries including Italy and Germany, but Pontz lives in Michigan, and the device wasn't approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration until last year. On January 22, 2014 Pontz became the second person in the United States to get the implant. The surgery itself lasted around four hours but the recovery took a few weeks. When doctors at the Kellogg Eye Center, at the University of Michigan, finally activated the chip, they warned Pontz that he might not see anything right away, but in fact the effects were immediate. He remembers: ""They turned it back on and I'm sitting there and I'm thinking: there was a light flashing on the screen wasn't there? And they said, 'yeah.' ""I looked up and I said 'there's a light up there,' and I turned around and the three lights in the room, I pointed right at them."" The surgery was a success. It appeared Pontz would regain some vision with the help of the glasses and the implant, but it wouldn't be easy. After years of not processing visual information, it wasn't just Pontz's eyes that had to learn how to see again. ""You have to go through the process, kind of like learning a new language,"" says Kari Branham, genetic counselor at Kellog Eye Center. ""You have to retrain your brain to see and understand those images that it's seeing."" So every week, Pontz and his wife drive to Ann Arbor for rehab, three hours there, and three hours back. ""They start out in the beginning really just teaching them what they're seeing,"" says Branham. ""So, how do they understand what they're seeing? What's the difference when they see the lights and when they don't see the lights? How to interpret what a shadow is, what's a light? Then learn about interpreting lines and things like that."" Although seeing pulses of light may not sound like much, for Pontz it's so much more than he had before the procedure. ""It's been pretty awesome,"" he says. ""I can tell when my grandson runs around the house, I can tell when people step in front of me, I can tell when my wife had on a white top versus dark bottoms, vice versa. I could follow my mom around on Easter; she had a light top on. Every day it's something small but something different."" There have been four such surgeries performed at Kellogg this year -- one of only two clinics in the United States currently doing the procedure, although 10 more are working to add the operation. The American Academy of Ophthalmology notes that surgery like this does come with ""potential complications"" and this procedure still isn't available to the ""mass public."" But it also notes that for ""someone who has no vision this is an outstanding breakthrough,"" even if the vision is still only ""rudimentary."" With the progress of patients like Pontz, there is growing hope for the ""bionic eye,"" and for a second chance at sight. ""I told my wife for years, 'I don't know when, what, or how, but I will see again,"" says Pontz. ""You got to believe in yourself -- I always have. Someday, yes, I will see again. I didn't know how, where, when -- but it's happening now.""","An artificial retina is restoring partial vision in blind people .

"North Korea is dangerously close to crossing a line. Not the line that leads to a missile attack on the United States, but the one that separates being a rogue state from being a parody of a rogue state. Pyongyang's bluster is as comical as its nuclear threats are implausible. This does not mean the United States should take the threats lightly. As Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has explained, when a country with a big army and nuclear weapons starts getting reckless, it is irresponsible to dismiss the possibility that it would actually do something insanely self-destructive. But the bigger concern has to do with why North Korea is rattling its saber. The reason may reflect more on the United States than we care to acknowledge. It is possible that North Korea is threatening America because it thinks that there is little cost in doing so, that the United States is less likely to strike back than ever before. It  may well be acting out a scene from one of those old Hollywood movies  that Kim Jong Un's father, the batty Kim Jong Il, used to love. In those Westerns, there was often a moment when some wannabe gunslinger, a crazy kid, challenges an old cowboy with a much bigger reputation. He does so to lift himself up. But he also doesn't think the old guy has it in him to pull the trigger anymore. Opinion: North Korea is not suicidal . If America's enemies think that we are shrinking away from crises, that rhetoric and nonintervention are now our standard operating procedure, that would indeed be worrisome. And the idea is not unknown in international circles.  A senior Middle Eastern diplomat suggested to me several months ago that because the United States has pulled out of Iraq and is pulling out of Afghanistan, and has been so reluctant to be drawn into Syria even as horrors and the regional threat mount there, America's enemies are starting to conclude we have ""gone soft."" A former top U.S. government official, a career guy who has served both Republicans and Democrats, told me he's worried that President Barack Obama is sending the message that he doesn't believe in Madeleine Albright's famous view of the U.S. as ""the indispensable nation."" What the United States appears to be willing or unwilling to do is often more important to world affairs than what we actually do. More often than not, our posture is our policy. Opinion: An accident, then war with North Korea? This doesn't mean the United States will make the world safer by adopting the recklessness of the first term of George W. Bush's administration. That, too, produces unintended consequences. But we do have to be careful about how our sensible restraint translates into other languages. If situations such as Syria make us look too timid about needed intervention, it can be as dangerous and provocative internationally as when tin-pot troublemakers such as Kim Jong Un bang the table and cry for attention. That said, when the kid in those old Westerns tries to take out the fastest gun in the West, it usually ends badly for him. Were North Korea to misread America's restraint as a lack of resolve, it won't survive the response it triggers. Obama has shown that when the threat is most urgent he does not hesitate to act, whether it means deciding to double down in Afghanistan, increasing the number of drone and special operations missions against terrorists, getting Osama bin Laden or bringing down Moammar Gadhafi. America may not be as aggressive as it has been in the recent past, but Obama's record -- the surfeit of caution regarding Syria aside -- suggests it would be a fatal error to test this cool hand in the White House. Opinion: Kim Jong Un is not crazy . America's troop and weapons movements in recent days are a welcome clarification to those who doubt the country will protect its national interests wherever they are actively challenged.","David Rothkopf: Pyongyang's bluster comical and implausible, but it must be taken seriously .

"In the summer of 2007, mobile health (mHealth) was a field in its infancy. Monsoon season in Bangladesh, however, was in full swing, and with it came an enormous spike in cholera cases. I was working at a diarrheal disease hospital in the capital, Dhaka, at the time. More than 1,000 patients were rushed to the hospital on stretchers every day, most admitted to the makeshift wards of canvas tents that sprawled over parking lots and spilled into the streets. It was there that I saw my first patient die. He was a 53-year-old male, a husband and a father, emaciated and severely dehydrated. I remember struggling to place an IV into his cephalic vein, shuddering at the words repeating in my mind. He looks like a corpse. In 10 minutes he passed away, and we learned that his family had brought him on a three-day journey to the capital for treatment. They were wholly unaware that a satellite clinic had been deployed no more than 20 minutes away from their home. This was an enormous tragedy, and for years I would think about how it could have been prevented. It turned out that a solution was in place and waiting to be discovered.  The key is to leverage the unprecedented communication boom that's happening today. Health: Tracking your body with technology . It is easy to forget that the mobile revolution has been a global phenomenon. Of the more than 6 billion cell phone subscriptions worldwide, 76% are in developing countries. From rural Malawi to bustling Hyderabad, cell phone coverage and penetrance have become surprisingly advanced. When I saw the potential of how we can radically transform the way we deliver health care to underserved populations, I co-founded Medic Mobile in the hopes of building new models of health care support networks from simple, SMS-based platforms. This direction opened the gateway to establishing emergency triage systems, sending medication adherence reminders, enabling home-based antenatal care, tracking community immunization and dispatching mass announcements detailing satellite clinic schedules and locations. Handheld device that saves lives . For example, in Kurnool, India, where first-year childhood vaccination rates have lingered in the 60th percentile, we worked with a local immunization center to design a mobile-based reminder system for parents. Local health workers enrolled newly pregnant women in our records and took down their cell phone number. Once the system was updated with an infant's birth date, it would automatically schedule SMS reminders to be sent to the family when it was time for a vaccination. The system also sent periodic educational messages about the importance of complete immunization and the diseases they protected against. After six months of piloting this intervention, we were already seeing dramatic improvements in vaccination rates. Mothers walked into the clinic grinning, baby in one hand, cell phone in the other. While I am focused on helping people in the developing countries, I am keenly aware that mobile health care innovations also impact people close to home. Working at Stanford hospitals, I can attest to the luxury of checking my patients' vital signs while lying in bed, or test driving in-house communication systems for consultations, which utilize smartphones rather than 1980's-era pagers. Health: Your smartphone is a pain in the neck . Mobile health development in the United States means innovating with the newest technologies, from diabetes management apps to miniature diagnostic devices, all aiming to capitalize on the potential of the latest tablets and smartphones. The possibilities are truly mind-blowing. Interestingly, U.S.-based mobile health care innovations can serve as testing beds for tools that will likely be deployed in Africa, Central and South America, or Southeast Asia in the coming years. And many SMS-based innovations gaining prominence abroad might return to the developed world as cost-effective methods of addressing fundamental problems in our overburdened health care system. I like to think that the paths of innovation are convergent. Imagine a world where, whether you're sporting an iPhone 5 or a Nokia 3100, you can remotely access your medical information, reschedule doctors' appointments, monitor loved ones' vital signs, receive secure lab results, compete for ""best blood sugar control,"" manage tailored medication reminders, etc. That day may not be that far off.","Many of the 6 billion wireless subscriptions worldwide are in developing countries .

"As ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"" star Teresa Giudice faces a 15-month prison term that's set to start in January, it's no surprise she's also been dealing with ""sleepless nights."" The reality star and her husband, Joe Giudice, were sentenced Thursday to serve time after pleading guilty in March to numerous federal fraud charges. Teresa Giudice will serve a 15-month sentence. Joe received a 41-month sentence and also faces the possibility of deportation since he's not a U.S. citizen. 'Real Housewives of New Jersey' stars Teresa and Joe Giudice sentenced . On Monday night, both Giudices sat down with Bravo's Andy Cohen for the first part of an interview featured on Cohen's ""Watch What Happens Live."" When Teresa Giudice was asked about her reaction to the October 2 sentencing, she could hardly find the words to express how it has affected her, and how she fears it will affect her family. ""I was so nervous. ... At one point, I couldn't even move my fingers,"" Giudice recalled. ""My nerves were shot. I've had sleepless nights. I was shocked. It was very unexpected. I don't even know what to say."" In March, the reality housewife and her husband pleaded guilty to hiding assets from bankruptcy court and conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud, among other charges. In hindsight, Teresa Giudice says, she's learned a lesson. ""I do need to read things before I sign them. I do need to understand things before I sign them,"" she told Cohen. ""I'm a trustworthy person, and sometimes I take what other people say and I just believe them and I trust them. I can't do that anymore; I've got to make sure I fully understand something."" Giudice is expected to begin her sentence on January 5; once she's served her time, her husband is expected to begin his own stretch. The sentences were staggered to ensure the couple's four daughters have a caretaker. Being away from her kids, Giudice told Cohen, is what scares her most about prison -- more than the lockup itself. ""I just think about my daughters,"" the 42-year-old said. ""That's all I think about. I just want to make sure that my daughters are OK."" According to Giudice, their eldest, Gia, 13, has become her support system. ""She was being strong for me, I could tell,"" Giudice said. ""She was like 'Mommy, don't worry, I'll be there. I'll help Daddy with the girls; that'll prepare me for when I'm a mom.' That broke my heart when she said that."" She said she has only one request of Joe: ""All I said to my husband was, 'All you have to do is take care of our daughters,'"" she said. ""'That's all I ask. You've got to do what I do.'""","Teresa and Joe Giudice spoke about their recent sentencing with Bravo's Andy Cohen .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to buildings, they don't come much different than a mosque and a nightclub. In Istanbul, these two structures have more in common than you might think. Zeynep Fadillioglu is the designer behind both, her elegant creations blending sleek modernism with traditional ornamentation. Crafting the inside of a building is hard enough, without also having to meet religious requirements, and Fadillioglu consulted Islamic authorities throughout the construction of the spectacular Sakirin Mosque -- co-created by architect HÃ¼srev Tayla -- and opened in 2009. It is believed to be the first time a woman has designed a mosque. The 59-year-old has also designed two other mosques, both opened in Doha, Qatar, in 2010. But regardless of religion, every place of worship has one thing in common, says the mother-of-one from Istanbul. ""Serenity."" ""I think when you step inside a mosque, like any other religious building, you leave everything to do with the outside world, outside the door,"" says the head of an interior design and architecture firm which has delivered over 350 projects across the globe. When not creating grand places of worship, Fadillioglu -- who has degrees in both computer science and art history -- turns her hand to everything from London restaurants, to New York retail stores, and most recently her own line of furniture. Divine design . But when it comes to religious architecture, how do you design the inside of a building worthy of the divine? ""Beneath the big dome you feel humility,"" said Fadillioglu of the Sakirin Mosque, commissioned by a wealthy Turkish family and built in one of Istanbul's oldest cemeteries. ""At the same time, the beautiful chandeliers are much lower than normal, allowing people to feel more secure having this low light above their heads."" Rather than walls, huge windows covered in intricate metalwork allow light to stream in, ""caressing you much like the pages of the Koran,"" explained Fadillioglu. ""It might be a color, it might be a texture, it might be a form. But each and every piece I have designed in the mosque has some kind of connection with tradition."" Women worshipers . When the time came for Fadillioglu to craft the inside of Sakirin Mosque, she purposely placed the women's section in one of the most beautiful parts of the light-flooded dome. ""I positioned them on the upper balcony, because during prayer the women must be behind the men,"" she explained. ""But I also decided to make the balcony level one of the most beautiful areas, with the chandelier crystal droplets just in front, and where you can see the mihrab [an alcove pointing towards Mecca] from the best angle."" East meets West . Growing up in Istanbul, a city which straddles both the continents of Europe and Asia, Fadillioglu was influenced by a rich mixture of modern and traditional buildings. And while she always admired the craftsmanship of the metropolis's Ottoman era mosques, Fadillioglu had also become fed up with cramped and dark ""bad copies."" ""I wanted to be very contemporary with my design,"" she said. ""Up until recently, modern architects didn't design mosques -- it was always religious architects. ""A mosque isn't for a certain type of person, or certain type of area. It's supposed to be used by anyone and everyone. That could be foreign Muslims, or even Christian visitors coming to look at the building."" Fadillioglu might have made a name for herself designing mosques. But you needn't be religious to admire their beauty. Art and culture: The enduring allure of Frida Kahlo . Entertainment: Start Trek actress turned NASA recruiter .

"Police warned the 8-year-old they were going to tase her. ""Within seconds,"" an officer fired darts from the electroshock weapon into the chest of the 70-pound girl, according to a lawsuit filed by the girl's mother. ""The force of the electricity shot through her body, lifted her, and threw her against a wall. After the officers had stunned (the girl) into high voltage submission, they pulled the fish-hook like Taser darts from her chest, gave her emergency medical attention, bandaged the holes left by the razor-sharp hooks, and called the ambulance."" The reason the police were at the home was to keep the girl from hurting herself; the babysitter had called them because the child had a knife in her hand. All parties agree on this point -- the girl's mother, Dawn Stenstrom, as well as the defendants: the city of Pierre, South Dakota, its former police chief, Robert Grandpre, and the four officers at the scene on October 4, 2013. But their opinions about the responding officers' actions diverge from there. The girl's mother says the police used ""excessive force"" when they used a Taser on her girl. But Grandpre disagreed, telling CNN affiliate KSFY after the incident that the police ""might possibly have saved this girl's life."" Because of the pending litigation, Pierre Mayor Laurie Gill refused comment on Saturday. And attorney Robert Anderson, who is representing the defendants, said he was ""not going to comment on the merits of pending litigation."" After an independent two-month investigation, the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation ruled in December that the officer had acted appropriately. ""Given the circumstances facing the officer at the time, it appears from the report that deploying a Taser was the best viable way to defuse the situation,"" Wendy Kloeppner, the Hughes County state's attorney, said in a statement. ""That's bull****,"" Stenstrom's attorney Dana Hanna told CNN on Saturday. ""Four trained police officers surrounding a 70-pound, 8-year-old Indian girl,"" should have used less risky tactics, Hanna said. ""One distracts her, another grabs the girl's arm. That's what they should have done,"" Hanna said. ""She had a kitchen paring knife, but hadn't cut. She was a kid throwing a tantrum. They should have made an attempt to grab the kid, not use a weapon to throw her into a wall. A Taser's not meant to kill, but it does kill. Many people have died after being hit by a Taser by cops. It never should be used on a little child. She certainly wasn't presenting a danger to officers."" ""I don't fault for the police being there because they were called. They were there. But what happened while they were there is why I'm upset,"" the girl's father, Bobby Jones, told KSFY soon after the incident. One of the officers was a Taser instructor, while another was a hostage negotiator, KSFY reported. Grandpre told KSFY last October that Pierre police had used Tasers nine times in the past two years, with the girl, who is identified in the lawsuit only as ""L.M.J.,"" the youngest recipient of the electric shock. ""I don't think 8-year-olds should be Tased anywhere in the world,"" Jones said. Jones and Stenstrom are not married, and the father is not a party to the lawsuit, Hanna said. The plaintiffs are seeking at least $100,000 in damages, plus punitive damages and ""other relief as the court shall consider to be fair and equitable."" ""Her pain and suffering is going to be of that type that a jury will have to tell us what it's worth,"" said Hanna's co-counsel Patrick Duffy. ""Part of that is going to be a reflection of the fact that you're not supposed to use a Taser on a kid. I don't know of too many cops that don't know that."" Anderson, the defendants' attorney, said he didn't know if the case would go to trial, but Duffy said he hopes it does. ""L.M.J."" is getting mental and emotional counseling from a child counselor, Hanna said. ""What is it really going to honestly do for the rest of her life as she has to interact with authority figures and law enforcement?"" Duffy said. ""What's it going to be like first time she looks in the rear view mirror and  law enforcement gives her a speeding ticket? She won't shake that."" Since the incident, Stenstrom and her daughter, who are members of the Rosebud Sioux tribe, have moved from Pierre back to the tribal reservation, Hanna said.

"(CNN) -- Boy with stutter stops talking for ten years before going on to become one of the most revered voices in cinema history. It is a script Hollywood would have been proud to pen. But there was no need as this is the story of James Earl Jones, arguably the most well-known voice in modern cinema. The voice behind Darth Vader's mask in the ""Star Wars"" trilogy told CNN's Becky Anderson that from the ages of five to 14 he barely spoke a word. ""I stuttered so badly I gave up talking,"" Earl Jones said. He remembers the misery his condition caused him and says he is indebted to an English teacher who helped give him the confidence to start speaking again. ""We were reading great literature, and the idea of being able to say those words really inspired me. I never expected to be able to write things like that, but I did want to enjoy saying them."" Although his father was an actor the idea of acting had not occurred to the teenage Earl Jones he says. ""But the English teacher encouraged me saying: 'if you like the words you've got to be able to say them'. That's what started it."" Despite voicing one of the most famous villains in film history, Earl Jones kept quiet about his contribution until Darth Vader was killed in ""Return of the Jedi"" -- the final installment of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy. He says it was fun to keep everyone guessing. ""It became a big mystery -- 'who was that inside the mask?'"" he said. ""They used to say it sounds like Geoffrey Holder [the Trinidadian actor who famously starred in the 1973 James Bond film ""Live and Let Die""]. And I would say yes it does. Geoffrey has a slight Trinidadian accent. It was more fun denying it than it was admitting it until the episode where Darth dies. Then I accepted credit for it."" Earl Jones has starred or voiced in more than 100 films as well as being the voice of the CNN network but he is currently enjoying a highly successful return to the stage. The Toni award-winning actor has been playing the role of Big Daddy in Tennessee Williams classic drama ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" since 2008.

"Former Israeli foreign minister and opposition leader Tzipi Livni submitted her resignation from the Knesset Tuesday. Speaking to reporters outside the parliament, Livni said, ""My principles and values obligate (me) to leave the party of Kadima in the Knesset. I always said the seat was not everything. I am leaving at this stage but I am not retiring from public life"" Livni, who served as the head of the centrists Kadima Party, was defeated in a party leadership preliminary last month, losing to her party deputy and former Israel Defense Forces chief Shaul Mofaz, who took 62% of the votes to Livni's 38%. The resignation adds another variable in Israel's quickly evolving political landscape. Earlier this week Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated that he was likely to seek early elections. Some of his Likud Party officials predicted that the vote might be scheduled as early as September. Livni was a vocal and high-profile but largely ineffective opposition figure to Netanyahu's rightist coalition. In her remarks, Livni took Netanyahu's government to task for not putting enough effort into making peace with the Palestinians.

""I am lucky to have played and worked under some fantastic captains in my seven Ryder Cups to date, and I look forward to the challenge of trying to follow in their footsteps and help Europe to a fourth consecutive Ryder Cup victory at Hazeltine next year."" Should Clarke deliver victory at Minnesota next year it'll be the first time either team has won four successive Ryder Cups since the rules were changed to allow European golfers to take part in 1979. The United States last enjoyed success under Paul Azinger in 2008 at Valhalla but since then, Europe has dominated. After regaining the trophy at Celtic Manor in Wales in 2010, Europe pulled off an incredible comeback two years later in Chicago, winning 14½ to 13½ having trailed 10-6 going into Sunday's singles. Last time out, Paul McGinley led Europe to a commanding 16½ - 11½ victory at Gleneagles in Scotland, leading to yet more soul searching in the U.S. ranks. It is expected to ask Davis Love III to reprise his role as captain next week. The 50-year-old was in charge during that 2012 comeback, now known as the ""Miracle of Medinah."" Clarke enjoyed the support of many high profile European players, with world No. 1 Rory McIlroy part of a group that included Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and Grame McDowell. The 2011 British Open champion was selected by a five-man panel that included former captains Paul McGinley, Jose Maria Olazabal and Colin Montgomerie. European Tour chief executive George O'Grady, who was part of the selection panel, said: ""We are delighted to announce that Darren has accepted the invitation from the panel to captain Europe at The 2016 Ryder Cup at Hazeltine National. ""Darren has an impressive Ryder Cup pedigree having featured five times as a player and twice as a vice captain, so he has a strong understanding of the attributes required to be a successful captain. ""He is also a popular figure among the players and has both the passion and knowledge to lead Europe in the quest for a record fourth consecutive Ryder Cup victory."" Clarke's first Ryder Cup appearance as a player was in 1997 when Europe defeated the United States by a score of 14½ to 13½ at Valderrama in Spain under the captaincy of the late, great Seve Ballesteros. The 1999 installment was the only time Clarke has ever been on the losing side in the competition, the United States overturning a 10-6 deficit to win an ill tempered Ryder Cup known as the ""Battle of Brookline."" Victories in 2002 and 2004 followed but Clarke is probably best remembered for the 2006 Ryder Cup when he played just six weeks after his first wife Heather lost her battle with cancer. He won three points out of three in an emotional occasion at the K Club in Dublin as Europe routed the United States by a nine-point margin. Since then Clarke has twice been vice captain, in 2010 and 2012, winning on both occasions. He is a long standing player on the European Tour with 14 victories and has one major title to his name -- the British Open in 2011.","Darren Clarke named European Ryder Cup captain for the 2016 installment .

"(CNN) -- An abstinence-only education program is more effective than other initiatives at keeping sixth- and seventh-graders from having sex within a two-year period, according to a study described by some as a landmark. The study, published in the current issue of the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, indicated that about one-third of the preteens and their young teen classmates who received an eight-hour abstinence lesson had sexual intercourse within two years of the class. By comparison, more than half of the students who were taught about safe sex and condom use reported having intercourse by the two-year mark, and more than 40 percent of students who received either an eight- or 12-hour lesson incorporating both abstinence education and safe sex reported having sex at two years. Among students who received instruction on overall good health, but not having to do with sex directly, nearly 47 percent had sexual activity in the two years after the class. ""This new study is game-changing,"" the nonpartisan National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy said in a statement. ""For the first time, there is strong evidence that an abstinence-only intervention can help very young teens delay sex and reduce their recent sexual activity as well."" The study is ""quality research"" and ""good science,"" said James Wagoner, president of Advocates for Youth. According to its Web site, the Washington-based organization promotes ""a more positive and realistic approach to adolescent sexual health"" in helping youths make informed and responsible decisions about sex and reproduction. The federal government has invested heavily in abstinence-only education in recent years. Abstinence education funding, established in the 1996 overhaul of welfare, did not allow talk of any forms of birth control other than to explain their limitations. Critics of such abstinence-only programs said their shortcomings led to a lack of knowledge of contraception among youths who choose to be sexually active. President Obama cut funding for abstinence-only education in his 2010 budget. The study did not impart any moral aspects to delaying the onset of intercourse, such as portraying sex in a negative light, Wagoner said. Nor did the abstinence lesson ask students to delay intercourse until marriage -- only until they are ready. Instead, the scientists said, they were interested in finding the effectiveness of various programs because adolescents who initiate intercourse at younger ages have a greater risk of sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy and report more sexually risky behavior, including multiple partners. The study looked at 662 African-American sixth- and seventh-graders recruited from four public middle schools that serve low-income communities in an unidentified city in the northeastern United States. The adolescents were recruited between September 2001 and March 2002. The participants' average age was 12.2 years, and 53.5 percent were girls. Although all young people are at risk of contracting the human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted infections and having unintended pregnancies, the study says the danger is greatest among African-Americans. ""In 2005,"" the authors said, ""17 percent of adolescents in the United States were African-American but 69 percent of adolescents with HIV/AIDS were African-American. Rates of STI are the highest among African-American individuals and adolescents, particularly adolescent girls. Pregnancy rates have been higher among African-American adolescents than among their Hispanic and white counterparts."" The study's authors -- John B. Jemmott III, Loretta S. Jemmott and Geoffrey T. Fong -- cautioned that abstinence programs are not an effective long-term solution. ""A common shortcoming of behavior-change interventions is that efficacy is demonstrated in the short term but disappears at longer-term follow-up,"" the report said. ""This may particularly be a problem for abstinence interventions. Unlike many risk behaviors (e.g., cigarette smoking, drug use), sexual intercourse is an age-graded behavior; the expectation is that people will eventually have sexual intercourse."" The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy echoed that sentiment. ""It is unreasonable to expect any single intervention, curriculum or program to solve the teen pregnancy problem,"" the nonprofit organization said. ""True and lasting progress requires not only good programs in schools and communities, but also supportive norms and values, informed and active parents, good health services, a positive media culture and more."" Wagoner, president of Advocates for Youth, said that in his opinion, the abstinence program does not go far enough toward helping youths who are sexually active make informed choices about contraception. He would like to see federal funding for programs aimed at abstinence and safe sex. ""If you've got 24 percent of your class that's sexually active, what about them?"" Wagoner asked. In addition, he said, ""OK, you're 12. You've abstained until 14. What about the next five years?""","Third of youths who had 8-hour abstinence lesson had sexual intercourse within 2 years .

"(CNN)Rory McIlroy is unquestionably the world's best golfer after a 2014 in which he soared to the top of the world rankings and charged to two major triumphs. The Northern Irishman's success has earned him legions of fans around the globe, so we asked our followers on social media to send us their questions for one of the world's most famous athletes. And they didn't disappoint, quizzing McIlroy on everything from deadly animals to his beloved Manchester United... Rory McIlroy: ""No you're consciously thinking of your swing all the time. There's a certain way I like to see myself swing the club, and I do a lot of technical work on the video with my coach Michael Bannon on off weeks and make sure that we've got into the right positions for me. So constantly thinking of my swing and I'm making sure it's in the right place."" McIlroy: ""I think I'm most looking forward to playing Royal Country Down in the Irish Open. There's a lot of great events that are coming up, actually. I've got the Irish Open at Country Down, the Open Championship at St. Andrews. 2015 is shaping up to be a pretty special year for golf."" Have you played much in Africa? When will he play in Africa? Rich Isaac, Facebook . McIlroy: ""I've played a few times in South Africa. I've played the South African Open a couple of times. I played the Alfred Dunhill Championship once. I played Sun City for two days. I got sick and pulled out after two days. I'd like to make it down again. It's a beautiful part of the world and I really enjoyed my time down there, apart from getting sick at Sun City. But hopefully it won't be too long before I'm back down there."" Can you do better than Tiger Woods? Rory, can you do better than Tiger Woods? He was a hero in this game. Rugiatu Turay, Facebook . McIlroy: ""It's going to be a very difficult thing to do. Fourteen majors, obviously, which is his benchmark. And 80 odd PGA tour wins and everything else that he's accomplished. He's had a phenomenal career. I'll keep chipping away at it tournament by tournament and see how I go, but I think if you asked anyone if anyone had half of the career that Tiger Woods has -- has had so far -- they'd be very, very happy."" Did you ever encounter a dangerous animal on the course? Jordan Du Toit, Facebook . McIlroy: ""Yes, there's been a few. Where we play at the Bear's Club, there's a few alligators and snakes floating around. I've come across a couple of black mambas down there (in South Africa.) And there's always a couple of snakes. And I think there was maybe a -- is it an adder? A black otter, they're pretty dangerous as well. There are alligators in Florida and stuff too. But that's really been it."" McIlroy: ""George Best.

"About 10.3 million Americans gained health coverage this year, primarily as a result of the Affordable Care Act, according to a study by the federal government and Harvard University, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The estimate of newly insured adults — the largest to date — is the first published in a major medical journal and authored by some federal health researchers. The federal government had previously reported that about 8 million people bought private health plans on the state and federal exchanges and 6.6 million additional people enrolled in Medicaid since last October. But it has not estimated how many of those had been previously uninsured. The Obama administration took pains yesterday to say that the views of the study's authors are not those of the administration -- even as it hailed their findings. FAQ: What the Obamacare court decisions mean for you . ""We are committed to providing every American with access to quality, affordable health services and this study reaffirms that the Affordable Care Act has set us on a path toward achieving that goal,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement. ""This study also reaffirms that expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act is important for coverage, as well as a good deal for states."" The study found that the number of uninsured adults fell by a little over 5% nationally, from 21% in September 2013 to 16.3% in April 2014, with the most significant declines in the 26 states that expanded Medicaid under the health law. While all groups saw reduced uninsurance, the largest changes occurred among Latinos, blacks and adults between the ages of 18 and 34 -- groups that had been targeted for outreach, the study found. The analysis was based on data from a Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a daily telephone survey of more than 400,000 adults conducted from January 2012 through June 2014, which the researchers purchased from Gallup. It also took into account other surveys and changes in the economy and trends in insurance coverage. Researchers stressed the data's limitations, saying the estimate might range from 7.3 to 17.2 million adults depending on the assumptions. They noted that the Gallup-Healthways data does not include information on children's insurance coverage. It also doesn't take account of the young adults who were able to stay on their parent's policies because it does not go back before 2012. CNN Poll: Is Obamacare working? ""The Gallup data, which draws on an enormous sample, paint a compelling picture, finding a substantial drop in uninsurance since the beginning of the first open enrollment period, precisely where we would expect to see it -- in states that expanded Medicaid coverage and in income groups targeted by Medicaid or the new subsidies for coverage,"" said Genevieve Kenney, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute. The analysis found that more adults (approximately 4.4 million) also reported having a personal doctor and fewer (5.3 million) reported experiencing difficulties paying for medical care. ""The pattern of coverage gains was consistent with the effects of the ACA, with major gains for persons likely to be eligible for expanded Medicaid on the basis of their income and state of residence, but smaller and nonsignificant changes for low-income adults in states without Medicaid expansion,"" the study said. About 48 million Americans, or 15.4% of the population, lacked health insurance in 2012, according to the latest Census Bureau report from last year.

"On the campaign trail, Otto Perez Molina vowed to rule his country with an iron fist. The retired general said he would send troops into the streets to fight drug violence. Analysts summed up his political platform with three words: law and order. Now -- just two months after taking office -- the 61-year-old Guatemalan president is pushing a controversial proposal that has come under fire from U.S. officials and earned praise from people who were once his critics. During a routine speech last month, Perez Molina slipped in a surprise announcement. Last year's law-and-order candidate said he wanted to legalize drugs. ""What I have done is put the issue back on the table,"" Perez Molina told CNN en Español. ""I think it is important for us to have other alternatives. ... We have to talk about decriminalization of the production, the transit and, of course, the consumption."" The proposal caught many Guatemalans off guard. ""Everyone was expecting him to copy the strategy of (Mexican President) Felipe Calderon and involve the military in fighting cartels,"" said Martin Rodriguez Pellecer, director of Plaza Publica, an investigative journalism and analysis website in Guatemala. ""Then he made this surprise announcement ... without even his foreign minister knowing about it."" The president's unexpected pitch grabbed global headlines -- and the attention of international leaders. Central American presidents are scheduled to debate the idea in Guatemala on Saturday. The meeting could pave the way for a significant policy shift in a region where brutal drug violence is a daily reality. 'Too high a human cost' The attackers left a warning written in blood on a white wall at a northern Guatemala farm: ""I will find you and I will leave you like this."" Nearby, investigators found the bodies of 27 dismembered and decapitated workers. Authorities said members of the Zetas drug gang were behind the massacre last May in the province of Peten. Officials and analysts pointed to the slayings as more evidence of a devastating spike in drug-related violence across the region. At a conference on regional security last year, Guatemala's then-president, Alvaro Colom, said his country was reaching the limit of its ability to fight cartels. ""Eight killed per ton (of cocaine) passing through Guatemala is a lot of blood. If you pass through Honduras, there are 20 murders, and if we add it up, a ton of cocaine has too high a human cost,"" he said. Guatemala's murder rate is 42 per 100,000 people -- one of the highest in the world, according to a United Nations report. ""The immense economic power of drug trafficking has corrupted all the spheres of the state. The violence is incredibly high,"" said Mario David Garcia, a well-known Guatemalan lawyer and radio show host. Perez Molina isn't the first leader to propose that legalizing drugs may help stem the bloodshed. In a 2009 report, three former Latin American presidents -- Brazil's Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Colombia's Cesar Gaviria, and Mexico's Ernesto Zedillo -- called for decriminalizing cannabis for personal use. Former Mexican President Vicente Fox also has said he supports legalizing marijuana use. But analysts say sitting presidents rarely make such proposals, fearing political consequences. ""This has been an academic debate and it has also been a scientific debate, an issue that has been studied. And bringing it back into political debate, I think, is important,"" Perez Molina told CNN en Español last month. A political strategy? U.S. officials responded swiftly to Perez Molina's proposal. ""The United States continues to oppose such measures because evidence shows that our shared drug problem is a major public health and safety threat,"" the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala said in a statement a day after Perez Molina first floated his proposal. The embassy urged Guatemala and other countries in the region to continue fighting drug traffickers. ""With increased cultivation and consumption of decriminalized drugs, crime in Central America could well increase as the drug cartels shift their focus to other forms of illicit activities,"" the statement warned. Weeks later, on a trip to Mexico and Honduras, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said he was open to debating the issue. But he stressed that the United States would not waver from its policy against drug legalization. ""If (Perez Molina's) strategy is a political strategy designed to get Washington's attention, then it worked,"" said Samuel Logan, managing director of Southern Pulse, an online information network focused on Latin America. Some skeptics have suggested Perez Molina may be bluffing -- using the legalization debate to pressure U.S. officials into bringing back military aid to Guatemala. Such aid has been cut off for decades due to human rights abuses committed during the Central American nation's civil war. Guatemalan Defense Minister Ulises Noe Anzueto told CNN en Español Thursday that he was meeting with officials in Washington to discuss lifting the military aid embargo. ""It's a question of a political decision,"" he said. ""At any moment this restriction could be lifted and help us become more efficient partners in meeting our responsibility to help with security for the region and therefore the continent."" John Walters, who directed the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy from 2001 to 2009, said decriminalization is ""utterly self-defeating"" and would cause more crime. He described Perez Molina's proposal as ""a call for help and a call for U.S. leadership."" ""They're telling us, 'We think we have to give up, because we don't think we can win,"" Walters said. Details unclear as debate nears . Supporters of Perez Molina say Latin American nations should create new drug policies that don't follow in U.S. footsteps. The United States has not done enough to stop the demand for drugs, they argue, and many in Latin America are suffering the consequences. ""All we're doing is, in effect, fighting a U.S. battle outside of U.S. borders,"" said Ambassador Andres Rozental, a former deputy foreign minister of Mexico who advocates drug legalization. Creating a regulated market and opting for a less militaristic approach should decrease violence, he said. ""The fundamental problem of the violence ... is directly related to this so-called war on the cartels and this war on drug trafficking and the effort by the criminals to show that they have more money, more weapons, more people,"" Rozental said. But could drug legalization efforts in the region work without U.S. backing? ""Even if the United States is not willing at this point to go along, there is space for Latin American countries to take certain steps,"" said Martin Jelsma, a political scientist who specializes in Latin America and international drugs policy at the Transnational Institute. ""Of course, politically, that will be one of the questions. How much pressure will the United States put on Latin America to prevent this?"" Details about the ideas Central American leaders will debate Saturday have not been released to the public. Perez Molina plans to present a range of proposals at the meeting, Guatemala's foreign minster said. Drug legalization is also expected to come up before a wider audience of regional leaders at next month's Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia. Rodriguez, the director of Plaza Publica, said Saturday's meeting will be a promising start to the debate, even if it takes years to hash out the details. ""It wouldn't surprise me if in the next decade there would be a Latin American agreement to legalize drugs,"" he said. But some analysts were more doubtful that other countries in the region would follow Perez Molina's lead. ""Publicly, I would be very surprised if they stand behind this,"" said Logan, of Southern Pulse. Jelsma said he hoped the leaders would weigh other drug policy changes, in addition to legalization. ""I fear that this debate could lead into deadlock,"" he said. ""From the current situation, to jump to legalization as an answer to all these problems that are getting worse, I think it's a recipe for a debate that will get stuck pretty soon.""","Former military general Perez Molina surprised many when he proposed decriminalizing drugs .

"(CNN)Would you dare to freeze yourself fit by stepping into a chilling chamber colder than Antarctica? Golfers are used to frosty fairways, stormy tees and soggy greens but Padraig Harrington is taking the plunge with a real deep freeze. Ireland's three-time major winner is following in the chilling footsteps of actor Daniel Craig and super-fit soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo by exposing himself to cryotherapy in preparation for the 2015 season. ""I've used whole body cryotherapy for several years,"" Harrington commented to CNN. ""Guided by research from Setanta College, it's played a key part in my recovery, especially between competitive periods."" Cryotherapy translates as cold cure -- but for some the intense chill goes beyond words. ""The cold floods your brain and you can't process much more than putting one foot in front of another,"" Mike Moynihan, a columnist for the Irish Examiner, recalls of his experience in the chiller. ""Your body is in revolt and won't allow you to relax. It's so different, to be that cold, that I had a real notion of what people mean when they refer to a hostile environment -- but that only came afterwards, when I was outside."" Chill with a thrill . For others, cryotherapy is an ecstatic chill with a thrill. ""I call it 'legal doping,' says Eduardo Bohorquez, who runs New York's only cryotherapy center. ""When you come out you feel so euphoric."" Those brave enough to enter the cryotherapy chamber expose themselves to tingling temperatures of -130 degrees Celsius or -200 Fahrenheit. That makes Antarctica -- where NASA recorded the coldest spot on earth as -92 degrees Celsius at the end of December 2013 -- officially warmer. There are two types of cryotherapy treatments -- whole body and partial exposure -- but both involve serious sub-zero temperatures. ""It's not like sticking your hand in an ice bucket or taking an ice bath -- this is extreme cold,"" Liam Hennessy, Harrington's fitness coach and a world leading expert in cryotherapy, tells CNN. ""Whole body exposure is like stepping into a butcher's fridge. Partial exposure is more like entering a suntan cabin where the top of the head stays out of the cold. ""Padraig loves the challenge of taking whole body cryotherapy. He's a heavy worker. ""He has a huge practice and training regime. Part and parcel of the recovery process for him is cryotherapy."" The drafty drill sees Ireland's double British Open champion enter a TARDIS like chamber, which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to temperatures between -120 and -140 degrees Celsius. He will then experience what's known as a ""short exposure"" which lasts for two to three minutes. Cryotherapy was developed in 1978 by Toshima Yamauchi in Japan but is a relatively new treatment in professional sports medicine. The Olympic Sports Center in the Polish village of Spala helped the treatment spread west. Hennessy, in his role as director of fitness for the Irish Rugby Football Union, immersed his squad of international players in Spala's cryotherapy chamber in 2001. The respected Irish coach claims they were the first sports team in the world to formally use the facilities. Hennessy imported cryotherapy to Ireland and watched the freeze become a fashion. ""It's now taken off big time in Wales, England and France and Germany,"" he adds. ""The U.S. had no treatment centers in 2006 but now there are a couple of hundred."" But what are the effects of the big chill? Cryotherapy has two main benefits for maxed out sporting stars -- helping speed up the body's recovery after intense training and promoting a deeper sleep. ""Part of our investigations included taking serum and blood tests to monitor enzymes related to muscle damage,"" explains Hennessy, who ran a research program into cryotherapy. ""What we saw is that they returned to normal when players took part in cryotherapy compared to when they didn't. It improved the inflammatory response, which led to a better recovery. ""We've also seen heart rate variability -- which is a marker of stress -- returned to the baseline quicker if the athlete is exposed to cryotherapy. ""We noticed that sleep quality is also improved straight away by an exposure to cryotherapy. ""Individual athletes would report, 'I just had a good, deep sleep and I feel very good.' It's also possible to get a quality of sleep number by attaching a monitor to the wrist."" In a four-year study of 156 rugby players, 95% said cryotherapy had a positive effect on their recovery after training. ""Many of those that take it will tell you afterwards that they feel elated, they feel a rush of energy and a high as happy hormones are released,"" adds Hennessey. Mobile freezer . Traditional cryotherapy chambers, with three rooms of gradually dropping temperatures, are an expensive and unwieldy piece kit -- not the sort of thing you can pack on the team bus. But cryotherapy has now gone mobile which means sports stars can order a deep freeze almost as easily as a hot takeaway. ""Having the unit on the road and available on a rental basis is opening cryotherapy up to an awful lot more people,"" Ian Bridge, managing director of cryotherapy consultants Sappari, tells CNN. In 2013, Bridge conceived the first mobile full body cryotherapy unit in the UK, which is owned and operated by medical and industrial gases specialist BOC. His clients include Premier League teams Bolton Wanderers and West Ham United as well as rugby union clubs such as Bath and Northampton. ""You can get a whole squad through the mobile unit in a day,"" Bridge explains ""The British Lions rugby players used it before their tour of Australia last year and did three treatments a day. ""They were dragging the guys out of bed before breakfast sticking them through cryo, they'd do some gym work in the morning, then go in for another session before lunch, do some work on the pitch and then another treatment at the end of the day. ""The mobile unit is predominantly used to stimulate a quicker recovery after training or games."" It costs up to $1,500 to hire the six-meter long unit for a day in the deep freeze. ""We find our bookings come in around the Champions League fixtures,"" says Bridge. ""It was in heavy use over the Christmas period because there was such a heavy football program."" Cryotherapy is not only the domain of fatigued footballers, its frosty fingers are also spreading to the high street. Legal doping . The KryoLife center offers New Yorkers either a blast in its so-called ""cryosauna"" or a local treatment --increasingly used as part of a beauty regime to firm up skin -- where vaporized liquid nitrogen is blown over a specific part of the body. ""It is a growing industry,"" chairman Bohorquez, who brought cryotherapy to New York after receiving revelatory treatment in Poland on his injured right knee, tells CNN. ""There are a lot of famous people in the entertainment industry -- like actors Kevin Bacon and Ben Stiller -- and from the athletic world who use our center, so that has increased cryotherapy's popularity. ""Professional sports teams like the New York Knicks have a couple of machines which has also helped awareness."" You don't necessarily need a Hollywood salary to try cryotherapy -- it's probably cheaper than courtside Knicks tickets too -- because an icy blast in KryoLife's cryosauna costs $90. If the price continues to drop, along with the temperatures, is there a chance that cryotherapy will become as normal as having a sports massage or a protein shake? ""Yes, I truly believe so,"" says Bohorquez. ""Particularly the local treatment which is cheaper and less intimidating. ""I call cryotherapy legal doping because it boosts your energy levels and it makes your more alert. It increases your neuro-muscular response, so you react a little faster, and your immune system is activated. ""It boosts metabolism, which is also useful for weight loss, but it also stimulates your endocrine system so it relaxes you. ""I pretty much do it every day now,"" says Bohorquez cheerily. ""You should try it.""","Golfer Padraig Harrington uses cryotherapy as part of his fitness regime .

"For Camille Kim, music is life. On a typical day, the Emory University student spends hours on her laptop, scouring the Internet for the latest music. She uses a site that aggregates music recommendations from blogs to discover new artists and songs, streams them online and then shares her finds with her friends through a Facebook group. But she rarely buys songs or albums. ""If I really love an artist and I want to support them, I will buy their music,"" said Kim, 21. ""You can find [music] on the radio and TV, but those songs are chosen for you. The Internet allows you to find your own music. It's more personal."" Young listeners like Kim represent a looming sea change for the music industry, which has been in upheaval since the Napster era of the late 1990s. Five years ago, music consumers had to choose between buying a CD or downloading the album. Nowadays, thanks to the rise of music-streaming services like Pandora and Spotify, that choice is becoming whether to download music or just stream it online. Interviews with college-age music fans suggest that more and more are choosing to stream music instead of downloading it. After all, why pay for music when you can summon almost any song you want, at any time, for free? And the growth of music apps, online radio channels, and music-streaming platforms raise an even larger question: Do we really need to 'own' music anymore? ""The last time I bought a CD was probably in middle school, and I can't even remember what it was,"" said Sean Wilson, 21, of Atlanta, Georgia. ""Ninety percent of my friends stream music. To be honest, I haven't seen someone use iTunes in a really long time."" In five years, Wilson believes ""streaming will be the norm. It's more practical and more convenient than buying music and uploading it onto something. And the best part is, it's free."" Pandora, Spotify and 8tracks . The popularity of listening to music online can be directly linked to the emergence of music-streaming sites like Spotify, Pandora and The Hype Machine, which have grown substantially in the past year. These and numerous other sites now offer people the ability to listen to music without paying. And they're changing the way people consume music, says Paul Resnikoff, publisher and editor-in-chief of Digital Music News. ""We are already seeing a trend on the aggregate with the lack of music ownership,"" said Resnikoff, who believes the difference between a download and a stream is starting to blur. ""If I can get that Katy Perry song anywhere and anytime, what is the difference?"" Streaming sites are a big step away from the familiar Apple iTunes business model, which allows users to download a song or album and then upload it to an iPod, iPhone or other portable device. Apple to kill social network Ping, report says . Spotify offers users a database of more than 16 million songs for free, although the service limits how many hours of music a user can stream in a month without a paid subscription. Users can pull up any song in Spotify's database, or create custom playlists. The site launched in 2008 in Europe but didn't become available in the United States until last year. It now claims to have more than 20 million active users. Pandora acts like an online radio station, streaming free music 24 hours a day in a mix that users can customize, using Pandora's algorithms based on their tastes. Unlike Spotify, members cannot request specific songs, however. Pandora now claims more than 150 million users in the United States alone. Pandora's application has been among the most-downloaded free apps for iPhones and iPads, demonstrating that streaming is becoming a mainstream way to listen to music on portable devices. Pandora is now available on more than 400 connected devices, the company says. Then there is 8tracks, an online radio station that offers a more social music experience for its users. Named one of the top 50 best websites by Time magazine last year,  8tracks provides its listeners with free music hand-selected by other site users known as ""DJs."" ""The programming is crafted by people rather than an algorithm,"" said David Porter, CEO and founder of the site, which has seen a drastic increase in users. 8tracks users can upload tracks from their personal collection or use music from Sound Cloud, a site that emphasizes artists from independent labels. Although relatively new, 8tracks already has 5 million active users, Porter said. ""If you want a song on demand, YouTube is the place to go, but if you want to discover music you would go to Pandora or 8tracks,"" he said. Like Spotify and other services, 8tracks also offers a mobile app that allows users to stream music free to their phones. A brief guide to online music . Owning music ""a lot of work' Apple's iTunes is still the world's most popular music vendor, with more than 225 million accounts. One reason streaming music is catching on is the rise of online or mobile apps built on large music providers, such as Apple, that have already secured copyrights on songs, says Eliot Van Buskirk, editor and chief of Evolver.fm, an independent music publication . ""You can now build apps on top of apps, and everything is legal and no one is getting sued. In terms of music fans, it is a bit confusing because there are so many options,"" he said. ""I think downloading came from a time when our mp3 players didn't have Wi-Fi connections and our computers did not connect that fast."" But Van Buskirk also suggests another reason for streaming, not acquiring music. It's liberating. ""There is a certain relief with not having to own music. It is a lot of work,"" he said. ""So the challenge is how to still feel like you are building a [music] collection."" Portability of music is another big issue for many consumers. Recent Georgia Institute of Technology graduate McCall King, 23, says she needs her music accessible all the time. ""If I could reliably stream music for free to all of my portable devices I would use streaming sites exclusively,"" she told CNN. King says she prefers streaming because it allows her to access a large variety of music. ""I discovered She and Him, Zoey Deschanel's band before she was ridiculously famous, and I never would have sought it out on my own,"" she said. Porter says the way people own music is transforming. He believes the cloud model is where the state of music is heading, and for many people ownership is not essential. ""I think ownership is access, you don't have to have music on your local hard drive to own it,"" he said. Electronic Dance Music: How bedroom beat boys remixed the industry . Old media sticks around . If you listen to some young people, you might think that few people in the future will ever want to own music. But Peter DiCola, professor of economics and law at Northwestern University, disagrees. DiCola believes that music consumers' transition to a full streaming model will be a lot slower than people think. ""Old media sticks around,"" he said. ""FM radio is still around, and just because tech is new doesn't mean it is better in all dimensions."" He cited vehicles as one area where streaming music will be slow to gain a foothold. ""Think of Napster,"" he said. ""When it came out people were saying the record labels would disappear, but they didn't."" There is more to owning music than simply the convenience that digital media provides. Some consumers still want to own a physical memento by an artist they love, whether it's a CD with artwork and liner notes or just a few lines of digital ones and zeroes on their smart phone. Maybe that's why sales of vinyl records have been on the upswing in recent years. Resnikoff says this is because the need to own music is also influenced by human psychology. ""The music fan never ceases to surprise me,"" he said. ""If you told me five years ago there would be a boom in the sale of vinyl records I would have laughed. But people are buying them, and I think there are some people that will continue to buy music [and not just stream it]."" Overheard on CNN.com: Streaming debate strikes chord with music fans .

"The United States offered extensive assistance beyond drone strikes during a massive anti-terror operation in Yemen, including flying Yemeni commandos to a site where they killed scores of suspected al Qaeda members, a U.S. official said. U.S. Special Operations troops wore night-vision gear and flew Yemeni forces to a remote, mountainous spot insouthern Yemen, according to a senior U.S. official. The Yemeni helicopters that the U.S. personnel flew were Russian-made, which helped to minimize the U.S. footprint during the operation. Once there, Yemeni commandos engaged suspected members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the U.S. official said, who added that no Americans took part in actual combat on the ground. This same official identified the American personnel involved as special operations members, who are among the most elite and clandestine in the U.S. military. The official said the United States aided Yemen's government in other ways as well during the multiday operation, which resulted in the deaths of at least 65 suspected terrorists. CIA drones are suspected to have targeted al Qaeda fighters, weapons locations and a training camp. The latter is near where about 100 suspected members of the terrorist group met recently, according to video that's appeared on jihadist websites and produced worries that the group could be plotting new attacks. In the middle of that video, the man known as al Qaeda's crown prince, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, appears brazenly out in the open, greeting followers in Yemen. Al-Wuhayshi is the No. 2 leader of al Qaeda globally and the head of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, which is considered the most dangerous al Qaeda affiliate. In a speech to the group, al-Wuhayshi makes it clear that he's going after the United States, saying: ""We must eliminate the cross. ... The bearer of the cross is America!"" On Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman Adm. John Kirby declined to detail the U.S. government's involvement in this and other aspects of the latest anti-terror operation, though he did highlight its partnership with Yemen. ""We continue to work with the Yemeni government and the Yemeni armed forces to help them improve their counterterrorism capabilities inside the country,"" said Kirby. ""That work continues, and it will continue."" DNA tests are being conducted to determine if one of the most well-known members of that group -- bomb-maker Ibrahim al-Asiri -- is among the dead, according to Yemeni officials. A high-level Yemeni government official told CNN that al-Asiri is among those suspected to have been killed in a firefight Sunday between militants and Yemeni forces. DNA test results are not due for several days, the official said. These comments are the first public acknowledgment that al-Asiri could be among the dead. Even as that possibility is being examined, U.S. officials said they have no confirmation that al-Asiri is among those killed in an operation that didn't directly target him.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- For many families, a night at the ballpark is a treat. But it can be a nightmare for those with autistic children. Autism causes a greater sensitivity to environmental stimulation. So the lights, music and roar of the crowd can trigger a severe meltdown that is difficult to anticipate and control. ""They're frustrated and they're scared and they're just overwhelmed,"" said Debra Forman, whose 8-year-old son, Adam, has autism. ""You have to ask yourself if it's worth it."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported that 1 in 68 children in the United States are on the autism spectrum. For many of these families, fear of how their child will react to new situations -- and how others will react to them -- keeps them from gaining everyday experiences others get to have. ""It is tough to go out into public,"" said Shannan Maxwell, mother of Steven, 6. ""When he's having a meltdown on the floor and the whole entire store's looking at you like you're a bad mom, you just want to go and crawl under a rock."" Dr. Wendy Ross was heartbroken to hear stories like this from families. The developmental pediatrician also knew that isolation didn't serve her patients well in the long run. ""If kids are not in the community, building their skills from very young ages, then there's no reason to expect them to be independent one day,"" Ross said. ""It's a social disability. It needs to be addressed in a social setting."" So in 2007, Ross set out to do just that. Today, her nonprofit, Autism Inclusion Resources, helps families affected by autism navigate challenging social situations, such as airport travel, sporting events and museum visits. ""If you start taking steps outside of your door, your world gets bigger and bigger,"" said Ross, 43. ""We just want people to have opportunities."" Take me out to the ball game . Many Major League Baseball teams hold annual ""autism awareness nights,"" when they take temporary measures such as lowering the volume on the public address system. But Ross wanted to do more. ""You can't turn down the volume of the world,"" Ross said. ""It's nice to do it for one night, but our goal is for families to be able to go to a game on any night."" To that end, Ross partnered with the Philadelphia Phillies in 2012 to develop an innovative program. She armed all the Phillies game-day employees -- approximately 3,000 people -- with knowledge about autism and how to interact with individuals who have the disorder. Now, everyone from the ticket takers to the hot dog vendors at Citizens Bank Ballpark help create an atmosphere where families feel supported. ""I don't expect the staff to be experts, just to be aware of it and (be) understanding,"" Ross said. ""If families need a break, the staff know where to take (them) for a little sensory rest."" Ross also helps prepare the families for the event. They are given a booklet with pictures illustrating each step of the game, from arrival and getting a hot dog to the seventh inning stretch. Then she escorts families to their first game, with tickets donated by the Phillies. Each family is also provided a clinician at the game who gives additional support if problems arise. For Forman, having the professional assistance was a huge relief. ""When Adam was anxious or ready to leave, I had somebody to turn to, and she had some ideas,"" Forman said. ""Without her there, it would've been a very tough game for me."" Ross hopes that this supported experience will give families the confidence to return on their own. She also believes that this dual approach -- working with the Phillies and the families -- just makes sense. ""It's not enough to work with a child with autism, because we need the community to accept them,"" she said. ""You would never show someone how to use a wheelchair and then not have a ramp."" Beyond the ballpark . Ross has also found her airport travel program to be successful for families. Using the same principles, she trains airline and security staff at major airports and then guides families through a simulated travel experience, including checking in, going through security and boarding a plane. Since 2010, more than 200 families have benefited from Ross' initiatives. Building on her success with the Phillies, she is now working with Philadelphia's football and hockey teams. Soon she wants to partner with the city's public transportation agency. ""The hope for Philadelphia is to make it the most autism-friendly city in the country,"" she said. ""It will serve as a model of independence for other cities everywhere."" Ross also hopes that the tools she gives families can help them explore other settings on their own. ""We really see it as a stepping stone to a brighter future,"" she said. ""I feel like it changes the trajectory of lives."" After their successful outing at the ballpark, Forman took Adam to a football game. She believes this is just the beginning of their family's adventures. ""Hopefully, there will be zoos in our future, and aquariums,"" Forman said. ""The world is our oyster."" Want to get involved?

"North Korea surprised and angered the international community Wednesday by launching a long-range rocket that may have put an object in orbit. The secretive North Korean regime said the rocket had successfully blasted off from a space center on its west coast and claimed the satellite it was carrying had entered its intended orbit. The launch followed a botched attempt in April and came just days after Pyongyang suggested it could be delayed. Initial indications suggest the rocket ""deployed an object that appeared to achieve orbit,"" the North American Aerospace Defense Command, the joint U.S.-Canadian aerospace agency, said in a statement. North Korea has previously claimed that two other rockets fired in the past 15 years had successfully launched satellites, but other countries say they fell into the ocean before completing the task. Many nations, such as the United States and South Korea, consider the launch to be a cover for testing ballistic missile technology. The nuclear-armed North has insisted its aim was to place a scientific satellite in space. Countries around the world quickly condemned Pyongyang's move on Wednesday, saying it breached U.N. Security Council resolutions. The South Korean government said the launch was confrontational and a ""threat to the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula and the world."" The United States called it ""a highly provocative act"" that is ""yet another example of North Korea's pattern of irresponsible behavior."" Washington will work with other countries -- including China, Russia and other Security Council members -- ""to pursue appropriate action,"" said Tommy Vietor, a U.S. National Security Council spokesman. The launch came as a surprise to the United States, which did not expect it to take place Wednesday, a senior U.S. official said. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said he deplored the fact that North Korea ""has chosen to prioritize this launch over improving the livelihood of its people."" Neighboring countries said the rocket had taken off Wednesday morning and flown south over the Japanese island of Okinawa. The Japanese government said it believed one part of the rocket came down in the sea off the Korean Peninsula, a second part dropped into the East China Sea and a third fell into waters near the Philippines. Read more: What does North Korea's planned rocket launch mean? ""It is extremely regrettable that North Korea forced the launch despite our protest,"" Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said at a news conference in Tokyo. ""It is not acceptable, and we strongly protest against it."" South Korea's semi-official news agency Yonhap reported that President Lee Myung-bak has convened an emergency security meeting in Seoul. A launch had seemed unlikely to take place so soon after North Korea announced Monday that it was extending the launch window into late December, citing technical issues in an engine. Previous launch attempts by the North in 1998, 2006, 2009 and April this year failed to achieve their stated goal of putting a satellite into orbit and provoked international condemnation. Pyongyang had said this rocket launch would be ""true to the behests"" of Kim Jong Il, the late North Korean leader and father of Kim Jong Un, head of the ruling regime. Kim Jong Il died on December 17 last year, so the first anniversary of his death falls within the launch window that North Korea has announced. Experts had also speculated that Pyongyang wanted this launch to happen before the end of 2012, the year that marks the centenary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea and grandfather of Kim Jong Un.","NORAD says the rocket appears to have put an object into orbit .

"(CNN) -- It starts with a squiggle on an abandoned building, then another, and another, until the once-blank wall is transformed into a mural. A tag from the author marks the final touch. Eventually, this makeshift canvas will be wiped clean, restored to a mundane white wall, so the process can begin again. It's the nature of street art: spontaneous, public, fleeting. Inspired by graffiti's transient nature, Peter Ferrari said he went through a Banksy phase at age 15, referring to the British street artist known for his subversive and polarizing street exhibits. Banksy spurred the young Ferrari to begin spray painting garages with colorful aerosols. ""Back then it was more, 'Screw you mom and dad, I am going to draw on walls.' Back then it wasn't about the artistic side,"" he said of his youthful rebellion. The 31-year-old, known across Atlanta as the artist PLF, is hesitant to call himself a graffiti or even a street artist. The former Montessori schoolteacher, whose sprawling murals are found across Atlanta walls and commissioned by both private companies and individuals, instead sees himself as a public artist. Because of his use of spray paint, people around the city still call him a street artist. But what's the difference, anyway? ""Well, graffiti is illegal for one thing ... but it's a true art form,"" Ferrari said. What started as a subculture on the streets of New York in the 1970s has gained popularity in the decades since. Graffiti, often used synonymously with street art, has become aesthetically trendy in many places across America. Dave Betts said graffiti is celebrated in his Brooklyn, New York, neighborhood of Williamsburg. ""There are even art appreciation tours that include some of the street art,"" he said. Opinion: Olympics street art should be embraced . Street art is a culture in Brooklyn. ""I appreciate the capability and expression of the street artists in the area who have transformed streets that were considered common industrial sites,"" he said. ""What impresses me most is that graffiti can't be bought,"" Betts said. Although graffiti was introduced to American street culture in the 1970s, Ferrari said the technique was around before then. ""Graffiti in its current state has been around for decades. It is probably one of the largest art trends to last,"" he said. ""Think about pop art, it only lasted for 20 years, and it was one of the biggest trends. I mean, even cave paintings can be considered 'graffiti,' "" he said. What is graffiti? ""Graffiti is an affirmation of the individual,"" said Sara Cochran, curator of modern and contemporary at the Phoenix Art Museum. ""The idea of graffiti has a lot to do with raw energy and authenticity."" In the realm of public space, street and public art are often indistinguishable. Sometimes, what was once viewed as graffiti becomes pricey art. Cochran points to Banksy as an example. ""Banksy came from the streets and now has gallery shows and auctions,"" she said. Despite Banksy's rise into the high-end art world, he still hides his identity, she pointed out. There is more to street art than who creates it, Cochran said. ""Like Banksy, who is socially and politically driven, graffiti is driven by almost a communal pride,"" she said. Street art is considered rebellious in nature and illegal in practice, while public art is commissioned by cities or property owners and is considered culturally enriching and socially acceptable. Artists have used public spaces to showcase themes and bring awareness to issues. Marilynn Shcolnik was captivated when she saw blue trees in Seattle's downtown area. What Shcolnik saw was ""The Blue Trees,"" part of a public art installation by Australian artist Konstantin Dimopoulos. Dimopoulos covered the trees in a natural water-base pigment. The purpose of the piece is to bring awareness to global deforestation, according to his website. Like Dimopoulos, Ferrari sees public space as a canvas and public art as an avenue to bring his aerosol-inspired artwork to a larger audience, further blurring the lines between street and public art. 'Weird divide between highbrow and lowbrow' But does blurring the lines mean selling out? Ferrari said he doesn't think so. In fact, he said he has been hoping to enter the realm of public art for a long time. He sees being a public artist as an opportunity. ""Every time you do mural work, it is like another advertisement of yourself,"" he said. ""And this is the year for me to get into bigger galleries and publications."" But he said people try to differentiate the two. ""There is this weird divide between highbrow and lowbrow in the art world,"" he said. Even Banksy has been accused of becoming too commercialized. On the artist's website, one commenter wrote, ""Why are you such a sell out?"" Banksy responded, ""I wish I had a pound for every time someone asked me that."" What some call selling out, Ferrari said he sees as appreciation by a wider audience. Graffiti's aerosol imagery is gaining popularity and is becoming increasing socially acceptable, he said. Movements such as GreenGraffiti, which uses pressurized water to leave behind clean messages and images on the streets of New York, or the increasing use of commercial graffiti, where street artists are hired to create graffiti-based advertisements in cities such as London, Paris, New York and Atlanta, also shine light on the increasing commercialism of graffiti. But graffiti for hire isn't something for which Ferrari is necessarily enthusiastic. He recounted a recent art project that Coca-Cola in Atlanta commissioned. ""They commissioned a bunch of local graffiti artists. It was this huge bubble art ,and it was defaced the next day. It is almost an insult to the work of graffiti artists, when companies come into a place and just create advertisements in a form of graffiti art,"" he said. Nicholas Swann of Rochester, New York, lives in an area filled with graffiti, and he agrees with the sentiment. ""Street art to me is a person showing his talent; many artists go undiscovered,"" Swann said. ""They take chances when and where they do it."" What do we do with graffiti? Ferrari said Atlanta has a love-hate relationship with street art. ""In Atlanta there was a big push to stomp out graffiti, yet there is a huge desire by people who want street art, too,"" he said. In 2011, the city of Atlanta's Graffiti Task Force was funded $10,000 to crack down on graffiti. The task force, whose aim is to keep the city clean and prevent further vandalism, made several arrests of local street artists. But graffiti can be found is many cities across the United States. Gino Tucillo of Asheville, North Carolina, said street art is a familiar site in his city. ""Sometimes it's beautiful and interesting graffiti and other times it's beautiful elaborate murals that just show up randomly on local business walls,"" Tucillo said in a CNN iReport. ""Much of it finds a home with a lot of appreciation for quite a while until someone replaces it with something new."" Whether graffiti should be criminalized, however, can be subjective. ""If it's just random tagging to scar property and identify someone's ego -- it's a crime,"" Tucillo said. ""However, when you happen to walk through some dilapidated back alley and you find a giant, beautiful, sweet face of Yoda staring at you on some old forgotten brick wall and it simply says 'Jedi' next to it, that to me expresses something powerful."" Ferrari said he finds the paradox in the public's attitude toward street art interesting. ""People hate the tags, but they want the murals,"" he said. ""I think there is a misunderstanding, and people don't realize that it is all connected and all related. You can't have the mural without the tag.""","Peter Ferrari is an Atlanta artist whose work blurs the lines between street and public art .

"Curitiba, Brazil (CNN) -- More than any single soccer player, the fans took center stage during the World Cup. During the summer, each team's devotees donned their country's colors, painted their faces, shouted their songs, rejoiced in their victories and cried bitter tears of defeat. ""Whether you're in a host city or back at home watching it on TV ... it captures you,"" said Jon Burns, a lifelong fan of English football. ""I just love the passion."" Burns has made it his mission to turn that fan fervor into something more. His UK-based nonprofit, Lionsraw, mobilizes soccer fans to volunteer in cities hosting the World Cup and other major tournaments. ""We do football tours with a difference,"" said Burns, 48. ""They get to watch games, drink beer in a bar ... but for a huge chunk of our time, we go out to people in need."" It's an idea that struck Burns nearly 10 years ago, while sitting in a packed stadium during a game. ""I suddenly saw all the fans around me and ... it was like an untapped army,"" he said. ""And I started asking myself, 'What could I do if we could mobilize some of these people to do some good?' "" Since 2006, Burns' group has enlisted more than 500 volunteers to work on construction projects, educational programs and soccer clinics that have helped nearly 6,000 children. ""Football's always had the ability to break down barriers,"" he said. ""We're taking it a step further."" Giving back in Brazil . In June, Burns and his team brought almost 300 volunteers to Curitiba, one of the 12 host cities for this year's World Cup. The group's main project was constructing an education complex for Futebol de Rua, an after-school program that serves children from poor areas just outside the city center. Oscar Muxfeldt Neto, one of the program's founders, could not believe it when Burns offered in 2012 to help his organization. ""To come and to do this for us, for the children ... it is still a dream, you know?"" he said. ""This is the World Cup spirit."" The facility -- where academic tutoring, soccer instruction, art and music classes will be provided to more than 500 at-risk youth -- should be up and running by the end of the year. Burns and his volunteers will return there to teach English and coach soccer for years to come. ""When we invest in a place, it's not for a project. It's for the long-term,"" Burns said. ""The World Cup is just the first step into a country. It's a launchpad for us."" Like many countries that have hosted major sporting events, Brazil has seen protests during the past year about the estimated $11 billion spent on projects that have not necessarily improved the country's public services. While Burns makes a point to avoid politics, he believes his work helps communities that have not benefited economically from the games. ""We try to create opportunities for the local people,"" Burns said. ""We're not here to save anybody or solve anything. We're here to do our bit."" Igniting a passion . While Burns wants to assist those in need, he's also hoping that giving back sparks something deeper within his volunteers, many of whom have never done anything like this before. Volunteers from 12 countries came to Brazil to work with Lionsraw; most are from the UK, France, Australia and the United States. Burns finds that a shared love of soccer gives them an instant bond that gets stronger as they work toward a common goal. ""Within a couple days, they're just part of a team. And it's a tight team. There's a lot of fun, a lot of joking, and guys become friends for life,"" he said. Dominic Casciata, 27, had never volunteered before participating with Lionsraw in Brazil. The London-born soccer coach, who now lives in New York, spent eight days working with the group. ""It's just a brilliant feeling,"" Casciata said. ""Me and some friends who are volunteering here actually plan on coming back once the project is finished to see it in all its glory."" Chris Hearn, 48, helped build an orphanage with the group in South Africa during the 2010 World Cup. This time, he brought his 20-year-old son along. ""When I came back from South Africa, he saw the difference that it made to me,"" Hearn said. ""That's why he wanted to come, too."" Hearn and his son had such a good experience that Hearn now plans to bring his wife and daughter on the next Lionsraw trip in France in 2016. For Burns, that's the whole idea. ""Lots of guys come and kind of get it in their blood,"" Burns said. ""That's what we're about. ... And that is a movement.""

"The world's response to Ebola is its own sort of tragedy. Two facts make the point clear: . -- The United Nations has asked for $1 billion to fight the spread of the virus. As of Friday, it had collected only $100,000 -- or 0.01%. An additional $20 million has been pledged but not received, according to CNN Money. ""We need to turn pledges into action,"" the U.N.'s Ban Ki-moon told reporters. ""We need more doctors, nurses, equipment, treatment centers."" -- Liberia, meanwhile, which is hardest hit by the virus, says it requires 2.4 million boxes of protective gloves -- and 85,000 body bags, to be able to fight the virus in the next six months. Currently, it only has 18,000 boxes of gloves and less than 5,000 body bags. Let that second number sink in. Eight-five thousand body bags needed. But what is actually-really-truly behind the lack of helpfulness on the part of the international community? If you listen to right-wing pundits in the United States, we should blame Obama -- who they say is having his ""Katrina moment."" Those jabs are fueled more by upcoming midterm elections than reality. And they won't likely be quieted by Obama's announcement on Friday that he has appointed an ""Ebola czar"" to manage the U.S. response. The true devastation, however, has been unfolding in West Africa for months. And it's the subject of far less outrage in the United States. A more rational and deep-seated critique of the international community's relative inaction emerged in a recent BBC interview with Kofi Annan, the former U.N. secretary general, who is from Ghana. ""If the crisis had hit some other region,"" he's quoted as telling that news organization, ""it probably would have been handled very differently. ""In fact when you look at the evolution of the crisis, the international community really woke up when the disease got to America and Europe."" It's hard not to agree that race and geography do play a role in the world's callousness. They help explain why ""some other region"" -- any other region, really -- would get more help. Science tells part of the story. There's evidence lighter skinned people have trouble ""feeling"" the pain of those with darker skin. Researchers at the University of Milano-Bicocca, in Italy, tested this in by showing a group of Caucasian people video clips of people of various races being pricked with a needle. They monitored the viewers to see how their bodies responded to the sight of another person being hurt. The white viewers reacted more strongly -- or showed more physical empathy -- when white people were hurt than Africans. In another study, ""researchers found that white participants, black participants, and nurses and nursing students assumed that blacks felt less pain than whites,"" Slate writes. Except for a handful of health workers, nearly all of Ebola's 4,400 casualties have been black Africans -- and these simmering biases are deeply troubling. ""Ebola is now a stand-in for any combination of 'African-ness', 'blackness', 'foreign-ness' and 'infestation' -- poised to ruin the perceived purity of Western borders and bodies,"" Hannah Giorgis wrote for The Guardian. There's a long, ugly history of this sort of thing. Consider the 1994 Rwanda genocide, or the HIV/AIDS epidemic. ""In the case of AIDS, it took years for proper research funding to be put in place and it was only when so-called 'innocent' groups were involved (women and children, haemophiliac patients and straight men) that the media, the politicians and the scientific community and funding bodies took notice,"" John Ashton, president of the UK Faculty of Public Health, wrote for The Independent. The headline of his piece: ""They'd find a cure if Ebola came to London."" Maybe some blame should fall on geography, as well. Americans, in particular, know very little about Africa (just try this quiz on African geography from the Washington Post). The physical distance between Africa and North America or Europe -- two global centers of financial and political power -- also could lead people to feel emotionally distant from the crisis. ""I don't know about racism, but I do know when (Ebola) was only in Africa, hardly anyone in the U.S. cared that it was killing thousands,"" a friend wrote in response to a question I posed on Facebook. ""But now that like four people have it in the U.S., it is all-out panic."" Whatever the reason, a lack of empathy is clearly at play. Too many people panic when Ebola hits Dallas but shrug at the gruesome reality in Monrovia. Too many worry that someone who might have been in contact with an Ebola patient has boarded a cruise ship bound for Belize -- but we don't feel for Ebola's child orphans. I hope shining light on these realities can help change them. I'll leave you with a passage from an essay by Leslie Jamison, a woman who worked as a ""medical actor,"" meaning she faked illnesses for emotionally tone-deaf medical students. As she listened to the sometimes hard-headed students interrogate her about her made-up illnesses, she learned a thing or two about what it means to actually empathize with a person. ""Empathy isn't just something that happens to us -- a meteor shower of synapses firing across the brain -- it's also a choice we make: to pay attention, to extend ourselves,"" she wrote. Take that as a challenge. Pay attention. Extend yourself. And demand world leaders do the same.","The world's response to Ebola is its own tragedy, writes CNN's John Sutter .

"An Ohio sheriff defended the killings of more than four dozen lions, tigers and other wild animals Wednesday after they were turned loose from a farm outside Zanesville by its suicidal owner. Of the 56 animals released Tuesday night, only a grizzly bear, two monkeys and three leopards were taken alive, Muskingum County Sheriff Matt Lutz said. One monkey remained unaccounted for Wednesday night, but Lutz and conservationist Jack Hanna, who assisted in the effort, said the animal may have been eaten by one of the big cats. Lutz told reporters earlier that the farm's owner, Terry Thompson, pried open cages and left the farm's fences open before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound Tuesday afternoon. Lutz told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" that none of his deputies are equipped with tranquilizer guns. And with night falling Tuesday, he gave the order to kill the escaped animals. ""If this had been a 9 o'clock or 10 o'clock incident, in the middle of the day, odds are high that we may have been able to surround the area and keep everything contained,"" he said. ""But our biggest problem that we had was nightfall. We had about an hour, hour and a half of light, and we just couldn't take the chance."" Humane Society doesn't fault authorities for shooting animals . As of Wednesday afternoon, authorities had killed 49 animals -- 18 tigers, 17 lions, six black bears, two grizzly bears, three mountain lions, two wolves and a baboon. Those captured alive were taken to the Columbus Zoo. Hanna, the zoo's director emeritus, said he was upset by loss of ""precious"" animals, but defended the decision to use deadly force. ""To have no one hurt or killed here with 40-something animals getting loose is unbelievable,"" he told CNN's ""The Situation Room."" Hanna led a team of experts who arrived with four tranquilizer guns late Tuesday in an effort to corral the animals. He said the drugs take several minutes to subdue an animal even with a good shot, and one tiger had to be killed Wednesday afternoon when it turned on a veterinarian after being hit with a tranquilizer dart. Overnight, sheriff's deputies searched the eastern Ohio woods around Zanesville with night-vision gear and patrolled in pickups, armed with shotguns. Flashing signs on the highways in eastern Ohio warned motorists Wednesday: ""Caution. Exotic animals."" Schools were closed, and some frightened residents said they were keeping to their homes as sheriff's deputies hunted lions, tigers, leopards and grizzly bears. ""Yeah, there's a lion on Mount Perry Road. ... I just drove by and it walked out in front of me and was standing there under the street light,"" one caller to 911 told deputies. Zanesville Mayor Howard Zwelling said he received calls from people who were concerned that the animals had been killed. He said authorities were trying to use tranquilizers whenever possible. But Lutz told reporters, ""We are not talking about your normal everyday house cat or dog. ""These are 300-pound Bengal tigers that we have had to put down,"" he said. CNN.com readers express outrage at situation . Thompson's property is about 2 miles outside Zanesville. The 62-year-old had been released from a federal prison September 30 after pleading guilty earlier this year to possessing illegal firearms, including five fully automatic firearms. A civil case seeking forfeiture of firearms was pending, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Ohio's Southern District. He also had been convicted of animal cruelty and animals at large in 2005 and was arrested several times for traffic violations. Authorities were waiting on the results of an autopsy to determine the exact cause of his death, but Lutz said Thompson shot himself just after releasing the animals. Sam Kopchak, Thompson's neighbor, said he saw lions and bears running free Tuesday evening, with one tiger chasing horses. Kopchak managed to get himself and his horse into his barn and telephoned his mother. ""We have a major problem,:"" he told her. That's when she called the police. Thompson had threatened to release animals . ""It was like a war zone,"" Kopchak said when authorities descended on Thompson's property, set off the road named after Kopchak's family. Kopchak described Thompson as aloof. He loved animals. Kopchak saw him driving one time with a baby black bear on his chest. Lutz said authorities found primates inside the house. The community was in a state of ""shock and surprise,"" said Tom Warne, owner of Donald's Donuts and a lifelong resident of Zanesville. ""It's the craziest sort of thing,"" he said. Warne said he had met Thompson a few times. He used to come into the doughnut shop at one time. Opinion: Wild animals belong in the wild . The Humane Society of the United States and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals urged Ohio officials Wednesday to issue an emergency rule to crack down on exotic animal ownership in the wake of the slaughter. A previous emergency order issued by then-Gov. Ted Strickland that prohibited people convicted of animal cruelty from owning exotic animals expired in April. The Humane Society said Thompson ""would almost certainly have had his animals removed by May 1, 2011, if the emergency order had not expired."" ""Every month brings a new, bizarre, almost surreal incident involving privately held, dangerous wild animals,"" said Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the Humane Society. ""In recent years, Ohioans have died and suffered injuries because the state hasn't stopped private citizens from keeping dangerous wild animals as pets or as roadside attractions. Owners of large, exotic animals are a menace to society, and it's time for the delaying on the rule-making to end."" Fritz Douthitt, a volunteer at the Zanesville Animal Shelter Society, recalled Thompson's 2005 trial for cruelty and torture of cattle and bison. She said he had not been able to get up the hill to feed his livestock, and they died. Douthitt said it is inappropriate for people like Thompson to keep dangerous animals as pets, just as it was to shoot so many of them. Local governments, she said, ought to train law enforcement officers so they are prepared for bizarre cases such as the one that unfolded in Zanesville. For lions, tigers and bears to die, she said, was ""unforgivable.""","""We just couldn't take the chance,"" sheriff says .

"Debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 lay splayed for miles across silent rural fields in eastern Ukraine on Saturday. Two days after the jet crashed,  some bodies remained strapped in seat belts -- wearing inflight headphones. Conspicuously missing at the crash site near Torez were international forensic workers needed to secure and sort the wreckage, and a recovery crew to identify and remove with dignity the bodies of the 298 people who were on board MH17. A few things have been moved. Luggage was stacked in piles; mementos, children's toys were handled. Most everything is unguarded, there for the curious -- or for the taking. But the debris field  hasn't changed much overall since it slammed into place from about 30,000 feet in the air. Not like it would change, if investigators had a chance to cordon it off and catalog it. Plane parts, books, bodies . A round piece of wreckage the size of a small garage -- part of the cabin perhaps -- stood tilted over personal effects of people heading for vacation. Fields were bestrewn with novels, beach sandals, guide books and colorful carry-on bags. And all around them were the bodies of their owners, some dressed in shorts and other vacation wear. With leaders around the world calling for a swift, thorough and professional investigation, in eastern Ukraine, a small group of local government workers camping near the wreckage emerge from their tents in the mornings. They split up the crash site territory in an orderly manner to look for bodies, said journalist Noah Sneider, who visited the site. The emergency workers mark spots where they find human remains with stakes and tie white rags around them. There are so many of them. Bodies lie by the roadside, some in fields, some intertwined with parts of the aircraft. And they are spread out so far. ""Half of them are so mangled, you couldn't identify them,"" Sneider said. Collecting bodies not their job . A witness who saw the people falling to Earth on Tuesday said they had appeared from out of the cloud cover -- like horrifying rainfall, after the plane tore apart in the sky. Emergency workers tell CNN it's not their job to collect the bodies. And a local pro-Russian rebel leader has said that officials from the Netherlands and Malaysia asked that the bodies not be moved. But rescue crews and inspectors from those countries are not on site. And to get there, they would have to drive about 90 minutes from the city of Donetsk down pot-hole pocked roads. But these lead through a war zone, past checkpoints set up by varying local militias. There is no central command, virtually no rule of law. Three separate pro-Russian rebel groups guard the perimeter of the crash site alone, Sneider said. A small international delegation . A delegation of 21 monitors from the Organization of Cooperation and Safety in Europe made it in after assurances from rebel leaders, but local militiamen at the site allowed them only a brief view of a small outtake of the crash site. ""It basically looks like the biggest crime scene in the world right now, guarded by a bunch of guys in uniform with heavy firepower who are quite inhospitable,"" said OSCE spokesman Michael Bociurkiw. They asked militiamen for their commander, their leader, he said. ""No one showed up."" An armed man who appeared to have been drinking was there, Bociurkiw said, but he wasn't helpful. ""He kind of rushed all of them away, including the journalists."" Militiamen would have to trust international and Ukrainian crews enough to let them in, and trust is scarce in the conflict zone, Sneider said. Many militiamen hold conspiracy theories about the crash. ""They claim that it's a provocation conjured up by the Ukrainian authorities in Kiev."" They don't trust anything coming out of Kiev, he said. The OSCE crew is at the site to get an overview and report back what they see. They usually act as observers in conflict zones and are not equipped or trained to recover bodies and evidence. But for now, they, the local workers and a few journalists are the only ones there to care. Body bags at scene of Malaysia Airlines crash; Ukraine accuses rebels of looting .

"In the past week, we've seen an 80-year-old basketball franchise owner fall under the weight of racist comments about banning blacks and Latinos from his arena, and a 73-year-old Nevada rancher implode after saying blacks would be better off picking cotton. So, does that mean we are finally coming to the end of all of this? Once these octogenarian white men from another time die off, will we finally be free of empirical racism in America? Doubt it. I'm a young guy -- 24. I went to Howard University in Washington. I hang out with the basketball team (in fact, I am Howard's first play-by-play announcer for our home games. Go Bisons!). My friends are of mixed background. We all get along. But I also see others around me who, on the surface, may roll with a similar crowd, listen to the same music, say the right things, but who are also slowly being infected with the American disease of racial bias. I hear the subtle signs of racism on talk radio or on the Internet, where coded language of ""quotas"" and ""boot-straps"" is used in substitution of the old phrases of ""ghettos"" and ""laziness."" I read the Twitter feeds and troll the comment boards, listening to how those of like mind cluster together, reinforcing their own points of view. But we've got a black President, right? It's all good, right? Yes, racism, in less than a half-century, has largely gone from commonplace to taboo. If you are a 67-year-old beloved cooking show star who admits to having used the N-word, there are going to be consequences. If you own a nearly all-black NBA team yet verbalize a disgust for African-Americans, you're going to get checked. Today, any controversial statement, once exposed to the disinfectant of sunlight and mass media, gets met with immediate backlash. As it should. Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling learned this firsthand when NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned him for life. Cue applause, drop the mic, walk off the stage. We're done. Sure, we have come a long way. From the days when my father, a leading real estate inspector in Chicago, couldn't live in certain areas or shop in certain stores, to today, when I can graduate from a leading university, enter the field of media, and truly believe I have a chance to exceed my dreams, a lot has changed. But, for my generation, there are still real problems. We don't truly understand our history. And too often do we go from captivated to uninterested overnight, distracted by the next shiny object or hot Internet meme. We Millennials are the ""here today, gone tomorrow"" type of activists. This is most disappointing because access of information is easier than ever before. You no longer have to be rich or famous to have a voice. Just get a Twitter handle, post to your Instagram page or fire up a WordPress blog. So the question becomes, what happens next? We cannot simply stand idly by celebrating surface victories while the problems persist. Racism, as with all other prejudices, has to be attacked at the source. It will not become extinct with the passing of the older generations. A new racist is born every minute. I went to a largely white high school in the western suburbs of Chicago. When I was younger, maybe 10 or 11, I got into a fight with a neighbor kid who had just called me that magic word -- the ""N"" word. That was in 2000. Parents intervened, the skirmish ceased, and each of us was swiftly scolded. Now it's quite obvious where he learned the word. He wasn't born saying it; someone had to teach it to him. That kid is much older now, also in his mid-20s. I haven't seen him since, but I wonder what's in his head now? Is he growing up to become the next Donald Sterling or Cliven Bundy or Paula Deen? Or has time and society shifted his adolescent feelings about me and others like me? It must be remembered that racism is not an innate trait. It is a learned characteristic. We see it on TV. We hear it on the radio. We watch it coming from our parents. I just hope my generation has made that kind of an education a little less desirable. Within our generation are the remnants of a time long past. Today, we live in an age of tolerance. Yet everything is moving 100 miles per hour. That's one of the big differences between generations past and Millennials. For us, technology is a given. But it's also an opportunity. It provides an unprecedented level of exposure and opportunity to interact with others not like ourselves. In our generation a six-second Vine clip has the potential to become the lead story on the news, and what we do at a party or a game or in school can be celebrated or scorned with the click of a ""Like"" button. But we've got next. There is a changing of the guard coming in our society, and our number is coming up. So now, it falls upon a generation of young people to see the fight through. We are trapped in between two worlds, the new and the old. Our choices will shape the future. It is our duty as a generation to teach ourselves discipline. To know right from wrong, unacceptable from appropriate. This won't be on Sterling's generation. It will be on us. It is our duty to wash out the ignorant tendencies of our forebears across the board, regardless of race. Dedication will be required, along with an attention span that lasts longer than 140 characters.

"News articles, social media posts and images about Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests are being heavily censored behind China notorious firewall. Chinese state-run news outlets have largely ignored the pro-democracy protests except for the same Xinhua story in which the Hong Kong chief executive CY Leung denounced the demonstrations as ""unlawful."" Leung: Raw emotion 'will get us nowhere' In Hong Kong, residents have poured into the streets to defy Beijing's vision for its political future in the midst of its longest series of political protests since the 1997 handover. Their goal is to pressure China into giving the former British colony full universal suffrage. Dozens have been reported injured by authorities. On the social media front, Instagram has been blocked in China since Sunday. Users cannot view images and a message reads on the site: ""Can't refresh feed."" China observers noted that while the app can't be accessed in China for most, the country's First Lady Peng Liyuan's official Instagram account posted a picture of her and her husband, China's President Xi Jinping, on Monday. The photo app has been viewed as a relatively non-political social media platform, said King-wa Fu, an assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong. ""In the past two days, we can see a lot of people holding phones and taking pictures of different (Hong Kong protest) scenes on Instagram, Facebook and sharing it around,"" he said. ""It's a huge amount of pictures posted in a short period of time."" That may have led to the blocking of the photo-sharing app, Fu said. The Chinese government maintains strict controls over what can be seen on the Internet and social media. This firewall extends to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, and Google is rarely accessible. Hong Kong does not fall under the same restrictions. China's massively popular microblogging site, Sina Weibo is being censored at the highest rate this year with ""Hong Kong"" as the most commonly deleted term, according to Weiboscope, a Hong Kong University effort that monitors deleted posts. About 152 out of 10,000 Weibo posts were blocked, said Fu, who also works on Weiboscope. Why China censors Hong Kong demonstrations . Photos of police confronting young pro-democracy protesters are sensitive in China, because it's a reminder of Tiananamen Square, in which Chinese authorities cracked down on student protesters on June 4, 1989, Fu said. ""If you look at the political agenda of protests in Hong Kong, they have the same objectives. They're calling for democracy in Hong Kong and political reform. These are two main sensitive topics in China. This is the topic they don't want the Chinese citizens to widely discuss,"" he said. But China cannot completely black out any knowledge of the Hong Kong protests, especially with 40 million mainland arrivals to the special administrative region every year. Chinese authorities cannot control whether its citizens know about pro-democracy Hong Kong protests, but they can shut down ""autonomous communication space"" where public discussions can take place in China, said Xiao Qiang, an adjunct professor for the School of Information at the University of California at Berkeley. ""That's what they're trying to repress,"" he said. ""The Chinese government fears that the kinds of protest and exercise of rights demanding greater political freedom will be contagious and trigger something in China,"" he said. ""That's what they fear the most."" What you can see in China . The protest intensified Sunday when Hong Kong police unleashed tear gas on demonstrators. But there was no mention of it on the evening Chinese state-run CCTV news. On Monday morning, the homepage of China's major portals such as Sina, Sohu, 163 and China's state-run news agency Xinhua did not mention the events either. Searches on China's top search engine sites such as Baidu and Sogou for the terms ""Hong Kong protest"" or even ""Hong Kong students"" yielded irrelevant results such as stories showing a a blissful image of Hong Kong residents picnicking on the grass or how Hong Kong is welcoming tourists from the mainland during the national holiday week. When relevant results appeared on the Chinese search engines, the articles contained a distinctively pro-China slant and even surfaced a month-old article about a small pro-Beijing counter-protest in Hong Kong. Content that was more sympathetic to Hong Kong protesters had been removed with messages reading: ""In accordance with relevant laws, regulations and policies, search results could not be displayed.""","China's news and social media are stripped of discussions on Hong Kong protests .

"Rand Paul wears his political ambition for all to see. Look no further than the tie he sported during a three-day trip to Iowa. It had yellow images of corn, the crop that epitomizes politics in the first-in-the-nation caucus state. ""And by coincidence, I have one in the shape of South Carolina,"" the Kentucky Republican said Wednesday, drawing laughs. He was speaking at a Republican breakfast outside Des Moines at Machine Shed, a Midwest restaurant chain where the waiters wear overalls and drinks are served in Mason jars. As Paul blitzed across the Hawkeye State this week, holding events at Iowa GOP offices and campaigning for local candidates, he hardly played coy to the question of whether he was running for President. After all, his nine-city trip marked his fourth visit to the state since the 2012 election. ""I don't know why Iowa keeps popping up on my calendar, but it seems to be pretty frequent,"" he said Monday, clearly with sarcasm. His itinerary this time included a campaign-style schedule where he continued testing his 2016 message on the road. From reducing the federal deficit to defending civil liberties and reforming the criminal justice system, Paul mostly stayed on his talking points. But the trip was not without controversy. His combative answer to a reporter's question -- combined with video of Paul appearing to avoid an immigration activist — absorbed most of the attention surrounding his visit. Experts say it's unlikely those story lines will derail any progress Paul has made in the state with voters, but his comments could underscore questions some Republicans have about his foreign policy, especially as he seeks to broaden his appeal. Off-message . At his first stop on Monday, which actually took place in Omaha, Nebraska, near the Iowa state line, Paul held a news conference after touring a tech startup venue with Nebraska GOP Senate hopeful Ben Sasse. Asked if he still supported phasing out foreign aid to Israel, Paul fired back at a reporter for ""mischaracterizing"" his position and staunchly denied that he had ever proposed such legislation. But it's well-documented that he called for ending all foreign aid, including assistance to Israel, and sought support in Congress for his proposal in 2011. In Iowa, Paul stressed that he never introduced legislation that solely ""targeted"" Israel and argued that he strongly favors sending money to the country. Still, he added, Israel will be better positioned in the long run without foreign assistance. ""Every country ultimately would be better off to be independent,"" he said on Tuesday. Paul is also taking heat for quickly exiting a tense moment when an immigration activist confronted Rep. Steve King at a fundraiser while the two lawmakers ate dinner Monday night. Video of the incident shows Paul, at the behest of his press aide, quickly getting up from the table and getting away from the confrontation. Paul said he was stepping away to do interviews with local media. Whether or not those interviews were hastened because of the activist is unclear. Still, the video quickly spread and it was enough for critics to frame a narrative that Paul bolted from an uncomfortable exchange. The dust-ups in his trip made headlines and ate up much of the coverage of his Iowa visit. David Kochel, Mitt Romney's Iowa strategist in 2008 and 2012, said he doubts caucus voters will judge Paul negatively for leaving after ""someone tried to sandbag him."" ""I think he's fine on that,"" he said. ""As for Israel, that's a little more difficult. You have social conservatives in Iowa who very much feel the need to be in solidarity with Israel -- not just Christian conservatives, but it's also national security conservatives."" While Paul has voted in favor of sending more aid to Israel this year and has proposed cutting off aid to the Palestinians, his past statements and views on foreign policy are rooted in his libertarian leanings — a perspective still largely outside of mainstream Republican thought. ""He'll probably have work to do on that issue,"" Kochel continued. ""It could be one of those things that might limit his potential."" Still, Kochel thinks Paul is the current frontunner in Iowa among prospective candidates. He points to Paul's frequent travel to the state, his efforts to build a wider GOP, and the network of supporters built by his father's presidential campaigns the past two cycles. 'Son of Ron' In the 2012 Iowa caucuses, former Rep. Ron Paul of Texas finished with 21% of the vote, just slightly behind Romney and former Sen. Rick Santorum — who tied for first at 25%. Many of Ron Paul's supporters were previously inactive in politics, citing a lack of candidates who represented their views. ""Your father cured my apathy,"" one man told Rand Paul at an event in Council Bluffs. Building off Ron Paul's 2012 momentum, the so-called liberty faction of Iowa's Republican Party eventually took control of party leadership. Mainstream Republicans, with the support of Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, wrestled back control earlier this year. But Paul knows he needs more than just the libertarian wing of the party. As seen in his trip this week, he's going after the state's social conservatives and business Republicans, too. ""Paul is attempting to pivot from being 'Son of Ron,' so to speak,"" said Dennis Goldford, professor of politics at Drake University in Des Moines. ""He's never going to deny that or reject it. But he has the view that Republicans need a broader base or broader range than some other candidates have maintained."" Paul spoke at five GOP offices this week and five other events in a tour that took him around the state in a 730-mile loop. At each stop, Paul's main message sought to counter post-2012 perceptions that the Republican Party should change its message. ""I say 'hell no.' We have to be more boldly for what we're for,"" he said at the GOP office in Davenport. It's a mantra he has repeated in his travels across the country this year. But he proposes doing so with some traditional and unorthodox ideas for mainstream Republicans. Part of that includes a push to speak out against domestic surveillance programs and mount a strong defense of the Fourth Amendment. He has also been aggressive in courting voters and even Democrats to help expand the party. To do that, he's urging for reform to the criminal justice system with reduced sentences for nonviolent drug offenders and the restoration of voting rights to nonviolent felons after they get out of jail. In Northwest Iowa, home to many of the state's social conservatives, Paul placed an evangelical spin on his message. ""Many of us are Christians, we believe in a second chance in our religion. Anybody here who's not a sinner, raise their hand,"" he said Monday night at a fundraiser in Okoboji. ""We believe in redemption, should the law allow people a second chance."" But that's about as deep as Paul waded into social issues during the trip. He didn't talk about abortion, contraception or same-sex marriage until audience members asked him about the issues at one of his final events. Asked whether he supported a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, Paul said he ""favors the concept"" of traditional marriage but argued the federal government should stay out marriage entirely. ""I don't want to register my guns in Washington or my marriage,"" he said. The previous past two winners of Iowa caucuses, Santorum and Mike Huckabee, both ran on a vocal platform with regard to social issues. Goldford said if Paul doesn't devote more attention to those topics, someone else will step in to fill in the void. ""To function in Iowa he's going to have to address the concerns of conservative evangelicals because Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are going to do that,"" he said. Paul left Iowa before this weekend's annual summit hosted by the Family Leader, a group that's influential with social conservatives in the state. Guest speakers include Cruz, Huckabee, Santorum, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. Paul said he couldn't make it due to a scheduling conflict. But he indicated he'd be back. ""You have to meet people four, five, six times in Iowa because they expect a real personal touch, and I think it's actually one of the good things about the process,"" he told reporters, before needlessly adding: ""if I decide to do this.""","Rand Paul made a high-profile trip to Iowa this week .

"The mystery behind four days of unexplained shaking and odd sounds rattling Clintonville, Wisconsin, has been solved. The cause?  A ""swarm"" of minor earthquakes amplified by the unique bedrock beneath the state of Wisconsin. The strange sounds -- variously described as rattling pipes, clanging metal, thunder or firecrackers -- have continued on and off since early Sunday night in just one part of the small town of 4,600, located about 180 miles northeast of Madison. They were loud enough Monday morning that a CNN journalist could hear them during a cell phone conversation with city administrator Lisa Kuss. Speaking to Clintonville residents Thursday night, Kuss said the U.S. Geological Survey has determined that ""our community did in fact experience an earthquake that registered 1.5 on the earthquake magnitude scale."" That minor quake was measured on Tuesday night by several mobile earthquake monitoring stations that were dispatched to the region, she said. Based on all the data, the USGS believes the shaking and strange sounds are the result of  ""a swarm of several small earthquakes in a very short amount of time,"" Kuss said. While these small earthquakes normally don't cause such commotion, Kuss said the location of the shallow temblors helped amplify the shaking. ""In other places in the United States, a 1.5 earthquake would not be felt,"" she said.  ""But the type of rock that Wisconsin has transmits seismic energy very well."" When the shaking began last Sunday, hundreds of residents began calling 911.  Kerry Danley said she hear noises around midnight that sounded like a paintball gun. ""It was just pop-pop-pop,"" she said.  ""So I woke up -- just jumped out of bed actually -- ran downstairs, looked outside, nothing. Since Sunday, the shaking has happened nearly every night, quieting down during the day.  Absent of any explanations, residents were left to their own devices to come up with explanations. ""My bet is on gremlins,"" one Facebook user jokingly posted to WLUK's Facebook page.  Alien machinery buried for millennia, countered another. No, said one one tongue-in-cheek Twitter user. It's clearly mole men launching their attack on the surface dwellers. Others suggested huge earthworms or sewer cats.  Some Clintonville residents were even holding ""shake"" parties at night, waiting for the rumbling. As city officials ruled out electrical explosions, gas leaks and sewer collapses, they started consulting geological experts around the country.   Based on the data from eight seismic monitoring stations, Kuss said the USGS finally determined on Thursday that earthquakes were to blame. While the cause of the shaking has been solved, it's still not clear if the rattling in Clintonville is over, Kuss said. ""There is no way to say for certain whether our area will ever again experience an earthquake,"" she said.  ""But it still very likely, although not guaranteed, that any future earthquakes that we experience would again be on the low end of the earthquake magnitude scale."" Tuesday's 1.5 tremor is only the second recorded earthquake in Wisconsin since 1947, according to USGS geophysicist Paul Caruso.  The last quake happened south of Milwaukee, and was too minor to record a definitive magnitude. Caruso explained that the rock underneath Wisconsin and in much of the country east of the Rocky Mountains is ""very consolidated"" and without fault lines.  And that means small quakes are actually felt by residents, unlike in California where the energy is absorbed. For example, the August earthquake in Virginia that rattled Washington, was felt as far away as New York and Florida. ""All throughout the eastern United States, even small earthquakes are felt great distances,"" Caruso explained.  ""It's because the rocks are just really old. They transmit the energy really well."" He said earthquake swarms are actually quite common in the region east of the Rockies. Caruso said there was no hydraulic fracturing or ""fracking"" going on in Wisconsin, a drilling process that some believe may have caused a series of quakes in Ohio earlier this year. When asked why Clintonville residents heard such strange noises during the apparent quakes, Caruso said all seismic shifts generate noise but these sounds cannot be heard during major quakes. ""When seismic waves travel through the ground, they're moving ... faster than the speed of sound and when they hit the surface,"" Caruso explained. ""(It) rattles the ground like a speaker ...  so it's common for people to hear what they describe as sonic boom sounds accompanying earthquakes.  But usually when there's a big earthquake, people either don't hear the sounds because the frequency is lower than the threshold of what humans can hear. Or other sounds going on (like) things falling down.""","Residents of Wisconsin town began reporting unexplained sounds Sunday night .

"A struggling English youth club could have its fortunes turned around, thanks to a rather unusual gift. When an image appeared last month on the website of famous street artist Banksy, the race was on to find the original. The work, showing a couple embracing while checking their cell phones, was tracked down to a wall of the Broad Plain Boys youth center in the southwestern city of Bristol. Hours later, the Banksy -- believed to be spray-painted on a black piece of wood screwed onto the wall -- had been removed for safekeeping. It is currently on display in a city art gallery. Now, the notoriously elusive graffiti artist has written a letter confirming that the artwork is his and given his blessing for the cash-strapped club to make money from it. The painting could fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars, based on sales of past works. In a letter addressed to Dennis Stinchcombe of the Broad Plain Boys Club, the artist says that he intended the work to be ""a small visual gift for the area -- but apparently a financial one would've been more useful."" ""I don't normally admit to causing criminal damage but seeing as it looks like charges won't be brought any time soon you have my blessing to do what is right with the piece."" Stinchcombe said it was hard to believe the club's stroke of good fortune. ""It was very surreal,"" he said. ""You dream that it's going to happen. You don't think it will happen, and when it does, it's like 'boom' -- it's like winning (on) a lottery ticket, really. ... I was ecstatic. It was such a buzz to think, 'hang on a minute, all our troubles are over.' "" The club has been serving young people in the city since 1894, he said, but its finances have suffered during the recent economic downturn. ""Money is tight. We were getting to a stage where we could've run out of money if we didn't do something drastic about it,"" he said. ""Lo and behold, a Banksy comes along, which we never planned. It was just one of those things."" The artwork will stay in the museum for the moment, he said, but the club plans to auction it so it can help as many young people in Bristol as possible. It will probably set up a trust, Stinchcombe said, which will be ""a legacy to Banksy, forever and a day"" and help keep young people ""off the streets and out of trouble."" More than 20,000 people have been to see the piece in the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, he said. George Ferguson, mayor of Bristol, said in a statement that the letter was confirmed as authentic and that he believed the city had ""done the right thing"" in looking after the artwork while displaying it in aid of the boys club. He and Stinchcombe had agreed that if Banksy was to ""send a signal"" that the artwork was to benefit the club, he would be more than happy to oblige, the mayor said. ""Dennis said he would like it to benefit both the club and other youth projects in Bristol which would be a brilliant resolution,"" he added. ""Thank you Banksy!"" A company that held an auction of ""salvaged"" Banksy street works (PDF) last month, Sincura Group, estimated their values as ranging from $170,000 to nearly $850,000. The artist's last high-profile project was a month-long street art ""residency"" in New York in October. Is it a Banksy? UK street art image appears to show spies at work .

"When I was in my 20s, a girlfriend surprised me by saying that we didn't have to worry about overpopulation because technology would make sure we always had what everyone needed. Of course, economists have been saying this for decades. And of course, billions of people today don't have what they need. Because such people as my old girlfriend and economists presuppose that unlimited economic growth is necessary and also believe adding billions more humans to the world is desirable, I would like to share some thoughts about such thinkers, whom I'll call ""Growthers."" Why do Growthers think we should add billions more humans to the world? Do they want more consumers? Or is it something deeper, more biblical, more fruitfully multiplied? All of the above? Whatever their impulse, compulsive craving for ""no limits"" to economic growth and human numbers is irrational. A finite planet comes with limits. The United Nations expects the population to grow to about 9.6 billion people by mid-century; that's two more Chinas. That worries me. Yet in The Wall Street Journal on Saturday, April 26, Matt Ridley expressed these views when he reassured us, ""There are no limits because we can invent new ways of doing more with less."" He doesn't see that this very acknowledgment undermines his premise. If limits don't exist, why would we need to do more with less? He continued: ""Oil and gas ... will run out one day, but only in the sense that you will run out of Atlantic Ocean one day if you take a rowboat west out of a harbor in Ireland. Just as you are likely to stop rowing long before you bump into Newfoundland, so we may well find cheap substitutes for fossil fuels long before they run out."" Is it possible to think more incoherently about matters of such importance? And as a mariner I must point out -- if only for safety -- that a rowboat far in the open ocean is a frail and vulnerable craft. Another big blind spot in the unlimited growth view is the fact that other species also need to live here with us. But other creatures pay for our growth. Meanwhile, populations of fishes, amphibians, mammals, reptiles and birds are all declining worldwide. Species are going extinct about 1,000 times faster than the natural rate -- in other words, the rate it would be if humans weren't around. North America's pursuit of growth obliterated the tall prairies, exterminated the continent's most abundant birds and marginalized many mammals. An Africa of unlimited human growth will lose free-living elephants, apes and cats, natural landscapes and free-flowing rivers. It happens when farms and towns replace plains and forests. Would farming Africa like we've farmed the Plains solve Africa's problems? Food isn't Africa's only problem. Already, Ethiopia's planned dams threaten the nation's own people and Kenyans who rely on Lake Turkana for water and food. Competition and conflict always shadow the broad edges of humanity's tent, and a bigger tent tends to inflame tensions. Like all continents, Africa focused on growth would still have poverty, hunger and conflict. Better to focus on reducing poverty, hunger and conflict. Growthers and I agree that it's great that farmers can grow more food on fewer acres than in the past. We disagree utterly on why it's great. Growing food with increasing efficiency could solve human hunger and the need to give space back to other animals who need it -- if humanity doesn't continue to grow. But no-limits people want more food to feed more mouths. That keeps civilization on an endless Red Queen treadmill of running faster to stay in place. It means that more efficient food-growing accomplishes nothing. It means that more food will not end hunger. The Green Revolution solved the food production problem of its time. It did not solve hunger because we did not achieve the family planning revolution needed with it. Had we stayed for the main event -- stabilizing population -- the whole world might have reached a wonderful sweet spot in nutrition, health and security. What we got was billions more people and, consequently, more people living with hunger and poverty. More efficient technology and fewer people could help. But more people erase the benefits of technological efficiencies. We are forced toward more efficiency precisely because we're scraping deeper into an emptying barrel. Petroleum once ran out onto the ground in Pennsylvania. People collected it; they didn't even have to drill. Hydraulic fracturing for shale gas wasn't considered viable a decade ago because it's difficult and expensive. Economists and Growthers say, ""Look, we haven't run out because technology saves us."" Well, look, fracking is a symptom of hitting limits. Technology is forced to keep up with the pace at which we are running out. That you still have some checks left doesn't mean you're not going bankrupt. Fracking is postponing the switch to clean energy while the planet warms and oceans acidify. Shouldn't we work now on what's needed next? Digital tech saves us time. It doesn't save elephants and apes, lions and tigers, bears and eagles, salmon and rivers, orchids and forests, giraffes and pandas, coral reefs and turtles. Human growth dooms the animals we paint on nursery-room walls. Different kinds of growth -- more poor people versus more affluent people -- doom them differently. Economists can feel enthused about boosting unlimited growth only if they're not worrying that our accomplishments continue to come at the expense of forests, grasslands, coral reefs, the ocean, other creatures, and native peoples. And what are the accomplishments of growth? Has the doubling of world population in my lifetime caused the world to become  more peaceful and secure, kinder and more humane? Do we have computers and digital cameras and smartphones and Ibuprofen because there are billions more people than half a century ago? No. We have them because engineers improve technology over time, not because the population has doubled. Quantity isn't the same as better. Life improves with qualities such as health, safety, love, family, community, and compassion. More stuff, more crowding, more competition, more profiteering -- and let's be plain, profiteering is what economists' growth-mania is always about -- isn't what makes life worthwhile. It's only fair to poor people to let them in on the main secret of wealthy, educated and successful people: smaller families mean larger lives. In the happiest of coincidences, the thing that brings fertility down fastest happens to be the same thing that brings down poverty: educating girls. Illiterate women bear three times as many children as do literate women, and their children tend to stay poor. Meanwhile, each year of schooling raises women's earning power by 10% to 20%. And when people are a little better off, they desire fewer children. Gender and justice is always a good combination. For any pie, the biggest slices get cut at the least-crowded tables. The easiest, least expensive and most efficient way to have a bigger slice of the pie is to limit the number of guests you invite. Most of us know that the secret to a big life is a small family. It works on a global scale, too. If you love your children, humanity and the world, you want to take the best possible care of them, not crowd them out of the house. Growth for the sake of growth? I don't see the point.","Carl Safina: Some say innovations will solve problems of unlimited population growth .

"Will and Jada Pinkett Smith's 11-year-old daughter, Willow, was recently given a tongue-lashing on social media after posting a picture of herself sporting a tongue piercing on Instagram. asapniceee: ""She is too young for such a provocative piercing. Why would her parents let her pierce her tongue?"" tiffaneybabeyy : ""At your age, Willow, I don't think a piercing should be on you, especially there."" mariajx91: ""Maybe you should stop rushing to grow up Willow. It looks trashy. You're 11, and that doesn't look good at any age to be honest. Hope it's fake."" Though she later revealed that it was in fact a fake, magnetic tongue ring, people were already whipping their opinions back and forth about whether young people are too vulnerable to make permanent (or potentially scarring) decisions about their bodies. The issue:  What is classified as ""too young""? While the battle over body modification typically occurs between parents and their children, state legislatures have entered the conversation as well. A tattoo artist's take on summertime body art . In June, Jerry Garrison, a Florida grandfather, lost custody of his 10-year-old grandson after allowing him to get a tattoo of his initials on his right leg. A ""family tradition,"" according to Garrison. Under Florida law, a person younger than 16 years old cannot be tattooed except ""for medical or dental reasons,"" and anyone age 16 to 18 can be tattooed only with the consent of a parent or guardian. That law was changed in January 2012; it had previously allowed tattooing under the age of 16 so long as the minor had parental consent. Most states allow tattoos and body piercings for children under the age of majority, which is 18 years old in most of the United States, with parental consent. Though, some have tightened restrictions. In Idaho, ""No person shall knowingly tattoo, brand or perform body piercing on any minor under the age of fourteen (14) years."" In South Carolina, anyone under the age of 21 is prohibited from being tattooed. If a person is 18, a parent can give consent, but anyone under 18 is prohibited from ink of any type. And in Minnesota, it is unlawful for anyone under age 18 to receive a tattoo without written parental consent. Child development experts contacted by CNN agree with this age of majority for permanent body modification in young adults, but also assert age is but a number; maturity level is a much better parameter to go by. Psychiatrist Daniel Bober, an assistant clinical professor in the Child Study Center at Yale University, says it helps to look at a child's functioning in other areas of their life, such as school and peer relationships. ""The brain of a young person is still developing and they are less risk averse, more impulsive, and more likely to engage in risky behaviors,"" says Bober. Inking for Jesus: Dozens of church members take Lenten tattoo challenge . ""This is because the last part of the brain to develop is the part that tells them to 'put the brakes on' before they do something potentially harmful and dangerous."" It's also permanent, adds Victoria Pitts-Taylor, a professor of sociology at the City University of New York and author of ""In the Flesh: the Cultural Politics of Body Modification."" ""Tattoos, for example, have some style credibility because they reflect a willingness to 'trade in skin.' They are thus a Catch-22 for young people,"" says Pitts-Taylor. ""The aesthetic commitment they require probably extends too far into a young person's future -- how will they know they will be the sort of person to like it when they are 30, 40 or 50? But that risk is exactly what makes them appealing."" Hillary Kevilus recognizes that aesthetic commitment now, but it was a different story when she got her first tattoo at the age of 15. ""I had just broken up with my boyfriend, 'the love of my life,' and it's a heart with a dagger through it on my right calf. It's huge and it's a horrible reminder of a painful childhood and bad teenage decisions,"" Kevilus shares on CNN's Facebook page. John A. Haynes, however, says those reminders are exactly why he doesn't regret his decision to get his first tattoo at age 17. ""I don't regret my tattoos. Each one reminds me of where I was at certain stages off my life, and my mindset. It's like keeping a scrapbook, only on my body and not collecting dust on a shelf somewhere taking up space,"" he says via Facebook. Piercing ears is socially acceptable in America, especially for girls, in contrast to earlobe stretching or tongue rings, like Smith's, that are far less common. In some Spanish and Latino cultures, it's customary to pierce a baby girl's ears shortly after they're born. ""Children's bodies are especially susceptible to this kind of social policing. We allow them to modify their bodies to some degree so long as they do not step outside the norm; we see it as our jobs to bring them up as social ideals,"" she says. Pitts-Taylor says the double standard ultimately adds to the appeal for minors. ""Children are very good at detecting this kind of hypocrisy."" Tattoos: A journey of HIV acceptance . Dr. Timothy M. Jochen, of Contour Dermatology & Cosmetic Surgery Center in Southern California, says he sees tattoo removal patients as early as their twenties now. The three main motivators are relationships, work and motherhood. Cassandra Martins got her first -- and only -- tattoo when she was 15 with her mother's consent, and already began to regret it a few years later when she entered college. She has since undergone laser tattoo removal. ""Nobody under 18 knows what he or she wants forever. I cringe when I hear young people talk about inking themselves. I don't (think) the concept of 'permanent' or 'forever' resonates well with the young,"" she says. ""I don't see laser tattoo removal as a body-changing procedure; I see it as restoring a person,"" says Jochen. Unless it is a quality-of-life procedure like gastric bypass, he, like Bober and Pitts-Taylor, also thinks it's best for young adults to wait to have any body-changing procedures until they're of legal age. It's ultimately not what the young people are doing, but why. ""It is important for young people to develop what is on the inside and then what other people see will not matter as much,"" says Bober. ""At the end of the day, you have to feel good about who you are and often a cosmetic change will not fix what is underneath.""

"A weekend midair collision over northern Wisconsin sent one small plane careening into the ground while another limped safely back to the runway. Fortunately, both planes were carrying skydivers -- meaning that for the 11 people aboard the two aircraft, the collision resulted in nothing more than minor injuries to two of them, firefighters reported. ""It's definitely a reminder of the danger of the sport that we all love,"" Skydive Superior instructor Mike Robinson told CNN affiliate KQDS. The crash happened Saturday evening over Superior, Wisconsin, near the Minnesota state line. It happened as the two planes were flying close by as the skydivers prepared to jump in formation, Superior Fire Department Battalion Chief Vern Johnson told CNN. Robinson said the lead plane, which crashed, had four skydivers aboard along with its pilot; the trailing plane had five parachutists. Johnson said the pilot of the lead plane told firefighters that before the jump, he heard a loud bang and his windshield shattered. The plane caught fire and broke up in midair, but the skydivers and the pilot all parachuted to safety. Plane carrying skydivers crashes in Belgium . ""Everybody got out safely.

"A few years ago, PBS science correspondent Miles O'Brien reported about patients who were receiving modern artificial body parts to help them recover from the loss of the limb. Now, facing his own recovery after losing an arm while on a reporting trip to Asia, O'Brien is reviewing that story, reminding himself of which experts he should consult. He talked with CNN affiliate WUSA on Thursday in his first interview after a surgeon removed his left arm just above the elbow. He said he was going to see some doctors over the next few days. And he tried to look on the bright side of needing technological help with his life. ""If nothing else, this is a great opportunity for me to buy some really cool new gadgets, right?"" he told the station. ""I look forward to see what technology can do for me."" It seemed minor at the time . O'Brien was stacking cases onto a cart on February 12 after a reporting trip to Japan and the Philippines, and one of the cases fell on his left forearm. He thought it was a minor injury and didn't experience a lot of pain until the next night. He went to a doctor the next morning and was told he was experiencing acute compartment syndrome, which involves increased pressure in a muscle compartment. During surgery, O'Brien's blood pressure fell to the point where his life was in danger. The doctor made the choice to take much of the arm. O'Brien, 54, said his personal doctor studied the charts and agreed that amputation was the best option. ""He said it probably would have been the same consequence, wherever I would have been,"" he said. O'Brien said he is dealing with phantom pain, as if his forearm and hand were still there. And he admitted that he's had his mental ups and downs. O'Brien, an award-winning science journalist and former CNN correspondent and anchor, said work is a welcome tonic. Thursday, he was moderating a panel on climate change at the National Academy of Sciences in the Washington area. O'Brien revealed his story in a blog post entitled ""Just a Flesh Wound"" on Wednesday. ""I wish I had a better story to tell you about why I am typing this with one hand (and some help from Dragon Dictate),"" he wrote. He said that fans, friends and co-workers shouldn't worry about him. Pressure builds up . The National Institutes of Health says muscles in the arms and legs are separated from each other by thick layers of tissue called fascia, and each fascia has space in it, called a compartment, with muscle tissue, nerves and blood vessels. When there is swelling in a compartment, pressure in that area will increase and press on the muscles, blood vessels and nerves. ""If this pressure is high enough, blood flow to the compartment will be blocked,"" according to the NIH's MedlinePlus resource. ""This can lead to permanent injury to the muscle and nerves. If the pressure lasts long enough, the muscles may die and the arm or leg will not work anymore. It may need to be amputated."" Symptoms of severe cases of compartment syndrome include skin paleness, numbness, tingling, decreased sensation, weakness and severe worsening pain. Early diagnosis and treatment are key for a good recovery. Amputee pilot: O'Brien could return to flying 'in no time' Patients need immediate surgery, which involves making long cuts through the muscle tissue to relieve pressure.

"Alcohol. Bond's alcohol. The British spy James Bond may routinely get himself out of dangerous situations with skill and charm, but his body may be suffering all the while because of his drinking habits. British researchers predict he could die from alcohol-related causes, such as liver damage, by age 56. Scientists wanted to examine just how much alcohol the famous fictional secret agent consumes, and what effect that could have on his health. They published a study, led by Graham Johnson of the emergency department of Royal Derby Hospital, in the British Medical Journal's Christmas edition, which features a variety of offbeat research papers. Researchers found Bond's weekly alcohol consumption totaled 92 units a week, which is more than four times what doctors recommend. A real person would not be able to carry out such complicated tasks and function as well as Bond does while maintaining such habits, they conclude. A unit of alcohol is defined as 10 milliliters or 8 grams of pure ethanol in the United Kingdom. For some perspective on that, a bottle of wine is nine units, and a pint of beer is three, according to this study. The finding of 92 units a week could actually be the low end of the truth, as studies have shown that ""people generally underestimate their alcohol consumption by about 30%,"" the study said, noting other research has demonstrated that health surveys don't account for about half of all alcohol sold. In other words, Bond may be drinking much more than the large quantities portrayed in the books. ""We advise an immediate referral for further assessment and treatment,"" the study authors wrote, as well as ""a reduction in alcohol to safe levels."" 10 hotels featured in James Bond movies . Two study authors analyzed all 14 original James Bond books by Ian Fleming, focusing on the number of days on which alcohol-related events were described. But each of them only read half the books, representing a shortcoming of the study, which was conducted in ""the study authors' homes, in a comfy chair."" They found that in ""From Russia with Love,"" on the third day of the story, Bond drank about 50 units of alcohol -- the highest daily consumption in the collection of stories. It also appears that the spy's alcohol intake dropped around the middle of his career, but then picked back up gradually toward the end. ""This consistent but variable lifetime drinking pattern has been reported in patients with alcoholic liver disease,"" study authors wrote. Note that researchers did not analyze the Bond films, only the books, so the precise level of alcoholism that Bond portrays on the big screen is an open question. James Bond 50th anniversary coverage . About 2.5 million deaths worldwide are attributable to alcohol use, the study said. The cause of alcohol-related death is most often injury, liver cirrhosis, poisoning and malignancy. A real person who drank as much as Bond, more than 60 grams of alcohol per day, would be in the highest risk group for malignancies, depression, hypertension and cirrhosis and could also suffer sexual dysfunction. Early death would be likely for the spy as a result of such rampant alcohol consumption, researchers said. Fleming, the author who created the Bond character, and frequently drank and smoked tobacco, died at age 56 of heart disease. ""We suspect that Bond's life expectancy would be similar,"" the researchers wrote. Alcoholism may even be responsible for Bond's famous catchphrase ""vodka martini -- shaken, not stirred."" This may have health-related implications, too. Study authors posit that if Bond's alcohol consumption in the books is so chronic and excessive, he may be suffering from an alcohol-induced tremor. Chronic exposure to alcohol can damage a part of the brain called the cerebellum, which can lead to a tremor. This suggests -- and of course, this is only speculation -- that perhaps Bond can't actually stir his drinks. James Bond submarine car sells for $920,000 . Is Bond the man with the golden liver? ""In Casino Royale he drinks over 39 units before engaging in a high-speed car chase, losing control, and spending 14 days in hospital,"" study authors wrote. ""We hope that this was a salutatory lesson."" And yet, Bond kept drinking in subsequent novels. There's plenty of opportunity for another installment: ""From Rehab With Love.""","Study looked at 14 James Bond novels .

"As the story of the Obamacare website fiasco unfolds, senior administration aides tell me that the President is ""mad, frustrated and angry."" Mad that his signature legislative achievement is stuck at the gate, frustrated that he's running out of time to fix it and angry that he's got a second-term agenda now going nowhere. He's so furious, in fact, that he stepped out of character to vent to an assembled group of top aides, saying he would have delayed the website if he had known it was a mess. By Thursday, the president was venting publicly. ""Had I been informed, I wouldn't be going out saying, boy, this is going to be great. You know, I'm accused of a lot of things, but I don't think I'm stupid enough to go around saying, this is going to be like shopping on Amazon or Travelocity, a week before the website opens, if I thought that it wasn't going to work."" All of which begs the real question: How could he not have known? It's a real head-scratcher. Most powerful man in the world. Most important issue. Most politically explosive, particularly coming on the heels of the government shutdown. Consider the context: Republicans had just tried to defund Obamacare, and they lost in a heap of public humiliation. So the rollout of Obamacare had to be really impressive, because the Republicans had to be proven wrong. And yet, as the dry runs continued to produce red flags -- over and over -- the President remained in his steely cocoon. If this were the presidency of George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan, the obvious theories would abound: The chief executive is disengaged. Or incurious. Or worse. But since Obama is none of the above, what gives? This much is clear, after speaking with both past and present senior administration officials: No one was really in charge, so no one knew for sure how bad the overall picture was. What's more, and -- perhaps most telling -- no one wanted even to hint to the President that this techno-savvy administration possibly had a website stuck in, say, 1995. ""People don't like to tell him bad news,"" says an ex-White House staffer. ""Part of it is the no-drama culture."" Oh, that. The infamous no-drama Obama credo: no panic, no drama. ""No drama is attractive to people, except there are times when people actually should light their hair on fire,"" says one former senior administration official. ""That would have been a very good thing."" Indeed. People who have served in top jobs at the White House seem to agree on one thing: a President who wants to get at the truth has to understand the extent of his own isolation. And then establish a zone of immunity for truth-tellers. That, of course, presumes that the top staff inside the White House knew the full truth. And that probably wasn't the case. Again, you ask, how can that be? Answer: The operation resembled the proverbial blind men and the elephant parable: Everyone seemed to touch a part of it, but no one could really see the whole picture, or disaster coming right at them. ""It's not that someone had an envelope with a note in it saying here comes the second-term crisis,"" an ex-top White House staffer says. ""They were thinking there were some bugs, they would be fixed; these are smart people."" They may be smart, but it appears they had no singular leader. No rollout czar. They had health care wonks and tech wonks and political wonks and even a presidential wonk, but no put-it-all-together-and-make-sure-it-all-works wonks. And maybe, no truth-telling wonks, who would have warned the president that it was a no-no to promise that people could keep their health care policies. Everyone, it seems, lived in his own silo. And that's where they stayed. This is a President, says one admirer, ""who likes everyone to stay in his lane."" Which begs the question: Whose lane was it to say the website wasn't working? The probability is that the information filtered to a bunch of different people in a bunch of different lanes. Sure, the stay-in-your-lane theory of operation is important to a well-run White House, but here's the flip side if it's implemented too literally: If you hear something outside your purview that is bad, you may not want to report it higher. Why? ""Everyone thinks if it isn't in my lane, and I talk about it, I'm being a tattletale,"" says one ex-administration official.

""And it's hard to go in there and say, 'Well, I don't think this is going to work.' "" So, the irony. All the effort to spare the drama created a huge theatrical mess all of its own.

"(CNN)An elephant leg as a trash can. A crocodile skin for a bathroom carpet. A bear skin to help a man project power in the bedroom. These are just some of the objects confiscated by Polish customs officers and documented by Adam Lach, a photographer and filmmaker at Napo Images. For Lach, the illegal wildlife trade symbolizes the devastation that can result from human thoughtlessness, ""which, like locusts, can destroy all we have around us."" Lach first learned about the illicit trade when he was a teenager in the 1990s. He was shocked by the stories he heard. But it was seeing an exhibit of trafficked animal goods -- items seized by customs officials at an airport in Warsaw, Poland  -- that prompted him to embark on his photographic project ""Human Tsunami."" ""I am not an idealist, but in our world we have the belief that we are the only valuable existence on planet Earth -- and this is not acceptable,"" Lach said. ""The relation of men towards animals and nature is a reflection of the characteristics of the whole human population, as we still allow crimes against animals and nature. We do not understand that respecting the planet translates into respect of the people for themselves. ""Let us keep balance and let us use only what we need to live by. Cutting off the leg of an elephant and using it as a trash can is a testament to our hypocrisy."" Lach's pictures were mostly taken over a two-week period, although he anticipates taking more in the future. Some of the specimens shown were confiscated years ago at the Warsaw airport, which placed its exhibit in the middle of the departures terminal to raise awareness of the problem. Lach's images are not a story about a particular airport, he said, but they reflect a wider issue. ""Through these photographs, I will try to sensitize people and make them aware that they are often part of the problem,"" he said. ""This project aims to show human arrogance and folly and to build in us humility. ""In my work I often use the sense of peace and tranquility in the photographs. I avoid screaming images. Hence the idea of a black background -- I wanted to isolate these exhibits to give them the rank of authenticity and pain. ""I wanted to pass on, as well, how uncomfortable I felt when I had to touch and set up these exhibits to be photographed or listen to horror stories of the customs officers."" One story that stood out in particular for Lach was that of a rapid decline in a seahorse species surrounding Indonesia. ""This decline came suddenly, out of nowhere,"" he recounted. ""A short time afterwards, the Polish customs officers intercepted a cargo of dried seahorses. It turned out that some Indonesian company exported them to Poland as dietary supplements, a total of 27 tons of seahorses. ""How many seahorses had to die to produce 27 tons of powder? Millions. That almost threatened the extinction of the entire population, perhaps even more than one species. ""It shows how easy it is to cause irreparable damage to nature and how stupid we are."" Polish customs officers have done well in combating the trade, Lach said. They no longer find cardboard boxes filled with hundreds of turtles, or parrot cages containing tied-up birds, or containers of snakes and lizards that are stuffed so full that only half survived the trip, he said. Now, smuggling efforts are more likely to involve someone trying to transport a baby monkey or pass off a serval -- an African wild cat -- as a domestic cat, he said. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. ""At first glance, it seems therefore that it is better. But it is not,"" Lach said. ""This illegal trade is running as before, even faster, only ever more discreetly. ""Before, this trade flourished in markets and pet stores, while today traders often use the Internet. It is not only convenient, but also safer. The merchant offers for sale one or two pieces, sends them by courier, and if there is a setback, the loss is small. ""The criminal responsibility is smaller too, because it deals with smuggling a single specimen. Illegal transactions favor the Internet. A global network does not recognize borders."" Today, Lach said, anyone with an Internet connection can visit the traffickers' websites. ""The only limitation is language,"" he said. ""One who knows languages can buy everything.""

"Kimberly McCarthy on Wednesday evening became the 500th prisoner executed in Texas since 1976, when the death penalty was reinstated in the state, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. McCarthy was pronounced dead at 7:37 p.m. ET at the Texas State Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas, said department spokesman John Hurt. The 52-year-old former occupational therapist was convicted in 1997 of murdering her 71-year-old neighbor, Dorothy Booth, a retired college professor. Booth was found beaten and stabbed to death, and one of her fingers was severed, indicating a ring was forcibly removed, the Department of Criminal Justice said. Evidence later showed McCarthy had pawned the stolen diamond ring the day of the crime. When she was arrested, McCarthy was found with Booth's credit cards and a large knife stained with her neighbor's blood, the department said. In her last statement, McCarthy thanked her supporters, including her ex-husband, attorney and spiritual adviser. ""Thank you everybody. This is not a loss, this is a win. You know where I am going. I am going home to be with Jesus. Keep the faith. I love y'all,"" McCarthy said, according to Jason Clark, another department spokesman. Outside the prison, nicknamed the ""Walls Unit,"" a small crowd of demonstrators gathered Wednesday afternoon to protest the execution. They held signs that read, ""Don't kill for me"" and ""End executions in Texas."" The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on Monday denied McCarthy's appeal of her sentence and declined on Tuesday to reconsider it, saying her claims should have been raised previously, CNN affiliate KPRC reported. Texas has led the nation in the number of executions since 1976, but the number of states carrying out capital punishment continues to drop. Last year, Texas executed more people than it sentenced to death for the eighth straight year. Four states -- Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi and Arizona -- accounted for three quarters of all U.S. executions in 2012.

"American couple Matthew and Grace Huang fought the Qatari legal system for nearly two years over allegations that they starved their adopted daughter to death. Now cleared, they have begun their journey home to the United States. The Huangs left Qatar on a plane Wednesday afternoon, three days after an appellate court cleared them in the January 2013 death of their 8-year-old daughter, family spokesman Eric Volz said on Twitter. ""Thank you to all the silent heroes on this one. Wheels are up,"" tweeted Volz, who works with the international crisis resource group David House Agency, which helped with the Huangs' court case in Qatar. Volz, tweeting from the plane, also posted a picture of the couple aboard the aircraft. An appeals judge in Qatar on Sunday cleared the Huangs of starving their adopted daughter to death in 2013 in a case that drew global attention to that country's justice system. Despite the ruling, the Huangs were blocked from leaving Qatar at Hamad International Airport by immigration officials who confiscated their passports, according to the Doha News agency, which cited Volz. Diplomatic sources said Monday the departure was delayed due only to legal procedures that take place once people have been cleared of a crime. On Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador to Qatar Dana Smith said a travel ban against the couple was lifted following a motion that was filed Monday, and after talks between Smith and top Qatari officials. The Huangs, who were living in Qatar while Matthew Huang worked for an international company that was constructing sites for the 2022 World Cup, were arrested in January 2013 when their 8-year-old daughter Gloria died. They were charged with starving her to death, convicted in March and sentenced to three years in prison. The Qatari prosecutor sought to paint the Huangs as inhumane -- alleging they bought their adopted daughter cheaply from her poverty-stricken parents in Africa -- and had threatened to seek human trafficking charges. The couple spent nearly a year in prison before being freed in November 2013 to await proceedings surrounding an appeal that they filed. Appellate Judge Abdulrahman al-Sharafi overturned the conviction on Sunday, citing weaknesses in forensic reports and saying the trial judge failed to properly consider testimony from witnesses who said Gloria wasn't deprived. A report by pathologists hired by the defense, obtained by CNN, stated they found no evidence that tissue samples were taken from Gloria's body after her death, despite that Qatari investigators submitted an autopsy report. Advocates for the Huangs suggested the lab report was fabricated and said their request with the Qatari judiciary for a formal investigation went unanswered. After the couple's arrest, their two sons, also adopted from Africa, were temporarily placed in a Qatari orphanage. They have since been sent back to the United States to live with Grace Huang's mother.","Family spokesman tweets photo of Matthew and Grace Huang on plane headed home .

"Despite a highly-publicized anti-corruption drive spearheaded by President Xi Jinping, China's position on an international corruption perceptions index has deteriorated in the past 12 months. Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index 2014 ranks countries based on a 100-point ""corruption perception"" scale, where zero equals a ""highly corrupt"" perception and 100 means the country is perceived to be very clean. In the report, released Wednesday, China scored 36, falling to 100th place from 80th last year, putting it on a par with Algeria and Suriname. North Korea and Somalia rank equal-worst of 174 countries with a score of just eight. Denmark and New Zealand ranked least corrupt, with scores of 92 and 91, respectively. The Corruption Perceptions Index highlights the problems that emerging economies have with public sector corruption, misappropriation of funds and bribery, said Jose Ugaz, the chair of Transparency International, in a press release. It's based on perceptions of public sector corruption, from the perspective of business people and country experts. ""The Transparency International report is inconsistent with China's well-known achievements in the anticorruption campaign,"" Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Hua Chunying told CNN. ""The public will judge the achievement that the government has obtained and it will not be affected by the index. ""Corruption is the disease of human society which harms the justice and development of the entire society. It has to be eliminated."" Anti-corruption drive . Xi's much-vaunted drive against the ""tigers"" -- high-ranking public officials -- and ""flies"" -- lowly apparatchiks -- has been touted as a ""life or death"" priority for the leader, who announced the initiative shortly after taking office in 2012. Since then, Chinese state media says 75,000 cadres have been found in breach of austerity measures, as of the end of August. Recently, the anti-corruption drive was extended to China's military, with particular emphasis on projects and medical and weapons procurement, China Daily reported. In the past, Xi has said that corruption could lead to ""the collapse of the Party and the downfall of the state."" Despite his warnings, and attempts to address the issue, the report finds that perceptions of public sector corruption in China are worsening. Rukshana Nanayakkara, Regional Outreach Manager for the Asia-Pacific Region, Transparency International, says that Beijing's approach is misguided. ""China's fight against corruption focuses on prosecution, a very top-down way of fighting corruption,"" he told CNN. ""The whole campaign of catching 'tigers' and 'flies,' and from this summer the 'foxhunt' (the worldwide operation to track down fugitive officials) they all talk about prosecution, punishing people. ""In many other parts of the world it is a more holistic approach, you need to talk about prevention as well. So, irrespective of the fact that China is trying to punish corrupt officials, it is still thrives. So this is a very strong message to China."" China's drop from 40 points to 36 from in the index was one of the ""biggest falls"" of 2014, Transparency said. Other countries whose rankings dropped were Turkey, which dropped five points, and Angola, Malawi and Rwanda, which all dropped four. Economic growth suffers . Transparency International says the extent of corruption within countries has an impact on their own economic growth, and there's a risk of problems being exported with trade and investment. ""The 2014 Corruption Perceptions Index shows that economic growth is undermined and efforts to stop corruption fade when leaders and high level officials abuse power to appropriate public funds for personal gain,"" Ugaz said in a statement. ""Corrupt officials smuggle ill-gotten assets into safe havens through offshore companies with absolute impunity. ""Countries at the bottom need to adopt radical anti-corruption measures in favor of their people. Countries at the top of the index should make sure they don't export corrupt practices to underdeveloped countries,"" Ugaz added. Top countries and mark out of 100 . 1. Denmark (92) 2.

"Bourbon buddies they are not. But there are all the makings of a spirited conversation for President Barack Obama and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, when this Washington odd couple meets at the White House on Wednesday afternoon. A new Republican proposal to fund the government thought what has been dubbed the ""cromnibus,"" which would pay for nearly all federal programs with an ""omnibus"" spending bill but only offer a short-term ""continuing resolution"" or ""CR"" for immigration related spending is expected to be on the agenda. A presidential green-light to the ""cromnibus,"" a term that can only exist inside the Beltway, could help ease tensions with GOP lawmakers who are still furious over Obama's executive action on immigration.  White House officials have so far not threatened to veto Boehner's plan. The President's request for $6 billion in emergency funding to battle Ebola in West Africa and a new authorization for the use of military force in the war against ISIS are likely topics at the meeting as well. McConnell laid out a nuts and bolts legislative wish-list for December's lame duck session in Congress to reporters Tuesday. ""I think everyone agrees on a bipartisan basis those are the three things we must do here at the end of the session -- fund the government, make sure we don't have any retroactive tax increases and follow the tradition of many years which is to pass a National Defense Authorization Act,"" McConnell said.  ""I'm confident the Senate will do that before we depart for the holidays,"" he added. But in a sign of the frostiness of the Kentucky Republican's relationship with the president, McConnell referred to Obama's immigration plan as ""lawless"" and a ""poison pill."" Obama himself brought up the immigration action at a meeting with the Business Roundtable hours before he will sit down with McConnell. ""I'm still hopeful that we can get legislation done,"" he said, saying that would ""supplant"" his executive actions. While Obama and McConnell rarely ever sit down together privately, the two leaders have held such meetings a few more times than what has been previously acknowledged by aides to both men. Same goes for the President and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. The reason, top White House officials have said, is that knowledge of their conversations could jeopardize relations between the Republican leaders and their more conservative members. Yet it is also well-known the two men sometimes fail to connect. The President called but could not reach McConnell on election night last month, just hours after he beat Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes to win reelection in Kentucky and all but secure his place as the next Senate Majority Leader. RELATED: Obama reaches out, leaves message for McConnell . The scheduled 2:40 p.m. start time for Wednesday's meeting is a bit early to share that ""Kentucky bourbon"" with McConnell, as Obama offered at his post midterms news conference last month. But given that McConnell once vowed to make Obama a one-term president, perhaps the best both men can expect is a healthy pour of Washington reality.","The President and incoming senate leader Mitch McConnell will meet Wednesday .

"(CNN)Before you fly this holiday season, don't forget to remove your gun from your carry-on bag. Not remembering could get you in trouble. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration has seized a record 2,000 firearms from carry-on luggage this year, as of December 1. That's more than the TSA has ever seized in any other full year of its existence. And we still have another month to go. ""The vast majority of passengers have no nefarious intent but forgot their firearm in their carry-on bag,"" TSA spokesman Ross Feinstein wrote in an email. Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport security has seized the most guns this year, with 109 guns as of December 1. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is in second place with 93 gun seizures, and Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport is in third place with 73 gun seizures. Forgetting can be costly. Passengers whose guns are spotted by TSA security during the screening process can be arrested by airport or local police and face criminal charges, and the TSA can impose civil penalties. And TSA Pre-check members can be temporarily or permanently banned from the expedited screening program. ""It is a reminder that passengers should check their personal belongings before arriving at the TSA checkpoint, to ensure they do not have any prohibited items in their possession,"" Feinstein said. In 2013, the TSA seized 1,813 guns, up from 1,556 in 2012 and 1,320 seized in 2011. The agency seized 1,123 guns in 2010, 976 guns in 2009, 926 guns in 2008, 803 guns in 2007 and 821 guns in 2006. If you need your gun at your final destination, don't just drop it into your suitcase and check that bag to your mom's house. Go to www.tsa.gov to find the TSA rules to follow for checking firearms and other weapons. There are also state and local weapons laws that vary by jurisdiction. And it's not just about real guns. The TSA doesn't want you to attempt bring your firearm replicas, special gravy, cranberry sauce or super-special snow globes through passenger screening this December. Check them, ship them ahead of time or consider making your special sauce once you arrive. Pies and cakes can go through passenger screening but may be subject to secondary screening.

"Tatyana Fazlalizadeh had never heard of the term ""street harassment"" until two years ago. Before then, she simply considered the hisses and catcalls from strangers in the street an ""annoying part of everyday life"" that came with being a female. Now, street harassment is the focus of an ongoing art project led by Fazlalizadeh that's drawing global attention. This weekend, as part of International Anti-Street Harassment Week, people from the United States to Australia plastered communities with portraits from Fazlalizadeh's ""Stop Telling Women to Smile"" series. Named for a self-portrait of Fazlalizadeh with the message ""Stop Telling Women to Smile,"" the formidable portraits include sentiments meant to deter street harassment. One piece tells viewers, ""You can keep your thoughts on my body to yourself""; another reads ""Women don't owe you anything."" Fazlalizadeh has spent the past year and a half traveling the country speaking to women and creating new posters based on their experiences of gender-based street harassment. Her initial goal was to find out how women experience street harassment differently depending on where they live. Women in car-dependent cities described getting calls from men in cars. In cities like New York, Washington and Chicago, women reported men groping or leering at them on public transportation. What seems to be universal is the impact, Fazlalizadeh said. It leaves women feeling vulnerable and unsafe in their communities, as if their sole purpose in leaving the house each day is to entertain men. It makes women think twice about what they wear, the routes they take, even their body language. ""The way that it affects women and things they go through have pretty much the same theme: Women are out for consumption and for your enjoyment,"" Fazlalizadeh told CNN. ""It creates a sexually hostile climate in our streets and communities."" Since she started out papering the streets of Brooklyn in 2012, Fazlalizadeh has forged partnerships with community-based nonprofits and advocacy groups to create and share her work. She works with them to arrange talks with women and get permission from property owners to post her work on walls or in public spaces. She encouraged people who participated in Friday's global poster-pasting night to act within the bounds of the law. For Anti-Street Harassment Week, Fazlalizadeh put up posters in Atlanta with members of the community. In a talk at Georgia State University earlier in the week, she told a standing room only audience of men and women about the range of responses to the portraits. She receives mostly positive feedback from people in person; the posters in public, however, bear the brunt of criticism. Sometimes, people scribble derogatory words and phrases on her posters. Other times, she has seen handwritten exchanges on the posters debating its message, like a real-world message board. That's great, she says, because that's what the project aims to do: inspire discussion and hopefully collaboration among the sexes. Occasionally, a well-meaning man asks her in person about the idea of intention: What if he doesn't intend to harass or make a women feel uncomfortable? What if he just wants to compliment a woman in the hopes of getting her attention? Surely, that's not harassment. Fazlalizadeh understands where he's coming from, and she respects him for engaging her in discussion, she said. But what matters is how it makes the woman feel, she said. ""That's where all I can say is, 'I'm sorry, I don't agree with you,'"" she said, prompting laughter from the audience. ""That's where social norms and taking cues are important,"" she said. ""But the main goal is to make us rethink what's considered normal and acceptable treatment of women.""","Street art campaign ""Stop Telling Women to Smile"" aims to deter street harassment .

"Vice President Joe Biden called on Native American leaders to continue fighting what he called an ""epidemic"" of domestic violence on tribal lands and throughout the United States. Biden tailored the message of the White House's ""It's On Us"" campaign against sexual assault to address the disproportionately high rate of domestic violence in Native American communities, emphasizing the need for bystander intervention and community action during the White House Tribal Nations Conference. Native American women face the highest rate of domestic violence and abuse in the U.S. ""It's not about vigilantism, it's about intervening,"" Biden said. ""To me it's the definition of manhood. It's not standing by and saying, 'Well, it's a family affair.'"" Biden's remarks come as tribal authorities prepare to take on new authority in March 2015 to prosecute non-Native Americans who perpetrate domestic violence on tribal lands, which was included in the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act last year. The Vice President emphasized that it's now up to tribal governments to use their new authority to ""enforce the law, prosecute and stand for the women who have for too long endured not just injustice, but indifference."" Attorney General Eric Holder, who spoke after Biden at the conference, said already three tribes are part of a pilot program this year that has charged more than 20 non-Indians in domestic violence cases and touted increased collaboration between federal officials and tribal authorities. Biden spoke passionately about domestic violence and even reenacted calls he said he heard while visiting the National Domestic Violence Hotline. ""The most horrific prison on earth is the four walls of an abused woman's home. And far too many Native American women, for far too many, that's a daily reality,"" Biden said.

"U.N. experts got to inspect the site of a reported chemical attack on civilians near Syria's capital Monday as the United States accused the Syrian government of trying to cover up the attack. The U.N. inspectors entered the town of Moadamiyet al-Sham and appeared to be examining the area accompanied by doctors, according to videos posted on social media by Syrian activists. The team had a ""very productive"" day and will continue its work Tuesday after examining its findings Monday evening, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said in New York. Government and opposition forces have accused each other of unleashing poison gas last week in the suburban Damascus area of Ghouta. Syria's opposition said that as many as 1,300 people were killed, prompting new calls for Western powers to intervene in the country's 2-year-old civil war. In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called the use of chemical weapons a ""moral obscenity"" that could not go unanswered, and he said Syrian actions are ""not the behavior of a government that has nothing to hide."" Read Kerry's full remarks . Kerry stopped short of directly accusing President Bashar al-Assad's government of a massacre. But he said, ""We know that the Syrian regime maintains custody of these chemical weapons. We know that the Syrian regime has the capacity to do this with rockets. We know that the regime has been determined to clear the opposition from those very places where the attacks took place."" Meanwhile, he said that Syria was ""systemically destroying evidence"" of last week's attack by continuing to shell the area and that the danger the team faced Monday ""only further weakens the regime's credibility."" The Obama administration is now weighing how to respond in talks with U.S. allies and members of Congress, he said. ""Nothing today is more serious, and nothing is receiving more serious scrutiny,"" Kerry said. Monday's examination took place after unidentified snipers shot multiple times at a vehicle used by the U.N. team and after an explosion near the site inspectors planned to visit, the United Nations said. There were no reports of injuries. U.N. officials did not say who was behind the shooting or the explosion, which witnesses said may have been caused by a mortar shell. The Syrian government accused ""terrorists"" of firing on the inspectors, Syrian state TV reported. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said inspectors visited hospitals, interviewed witnesses, survivors and doctors and collected some samples. Speaking from Seoul, South Korea, Ban said he has directed the group to register a ""strong complaint"" to government and opposition forces to make sure the team's safety is guaranteed. The Syrian government agreed to grant the inspectors full access on Sunday, pledging to cease all hostilities as long as the team was on the ground, the United Nations said. And an umbrella group for the Syrian opposition, the Syrian National Coalition, said rebel forces would ensure the safety of any U.N. personnel in the area. But the government would not let U.N. inspectors approach the site for days, and the team feared that the chemical evidence may have dissipated. Attacks could reinforce poison gas 'taboo' Middle East analyst Richard Haass told CNN's The Lead that Kerry's comments ""went far out on a limb"" and indicate that a U.S. strike on Syria was in the works, with or without U.N. Security Council backing. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said military action was needed ""to underscore the principle, the norm, the taboo that these weapons ought to have."" ""No one, Syria or anybody else, now and forevermore, should be able to use such weapons, much less biological or nuclear weapons, with impunity,"" he said. But he said Washington should limit its intervention in the conflict, ""so we don't get enmeshed in what I think could become a quagmire."" ""If we want to help the opposition, the best way to do it is through considerable arming of those elements of the opposition with agendas we can support,"" he said. But with Syria already seen as a proxy war that has been spilling across its neighbors' borders for months, the prospects for improvement aren't likely to be aided by American airstrikes, said Andrew Tabler, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ""This is just going to be one chapter in a very long struggle we have in Syria,"" Tabler told CNN's The Situation Room. Russia, Syria's leading ally, has raised sharp objections to the possibility of any outside intervention. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Monday that reports of the use of chemical weapons must be ""thoroughly and professionally investigated"" and submitted to the U.N. Security Council. At a news conference Monday, Lavrov said there's no proof yet that the Syrian government was involved in last week's reported attack. And Sunday, a Foreign Ministry statement compared the Western allegations against Syria to the claims that Iraq was hoarding weapons of mass destruction before the U.S. invasion in 2003 -- claims that fell apart once American troops began searching for them. Charles Duelfer, the former head of U.S. weapons inspection teams in Iraq, said the U.N. experts will be looking to collect evidence from witnesses and survivors of last week's attack, including samples that can be analyzed later. ""They'll be looking for remnants of the munitions, which could be sophisticated munitions that a military would have -- or if it turns out, unexpectedly, to be the case that the insurgents had cobbled together some sort of CW capability, maybe they'll find that,"" Duelfer said. Duelfer said he expects the U.S. government has its own sources: ""Presumably, the National Security Agency can listen to people besides the United States, so they may have data which the weapons inspectors may not have,"" he told The Situation Room. But while Washington's evidence may be solid, U.N. inspectors ""provide credibility across the board."" ""When they say something, presumably all countries will say. 'OK, we can accept that, they don't have a dog in that fight,' "" Duelfer said. U.S. officials have said they have no credible evidence pointing to opposition groups using chemical weapons. And the Obama administration is expected to declassify the intelligence assessment backing up its assertion that the Syrian regime was responsible for last week's attack before any U.S. military action would take place, a senior administration official said Monday. That evidence ""includes but is not limited to"" satellite images of activity at Syrian military installations identified as including chemical weapons depots, a senior administration official familiar with the intelligence told CNN. And Kerry said he had argued to Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem last week that if the government had nothing to hide, ""then their response should be immediate: immediate transparency, immediate access, not shelling."" ""Failure to permit that, I told him, would tell its own story,"" he said. Opinion: How Al-Assad used chemical weapons to poison debate on Syria . Al-Assad: It wasn't us . The Pentagon has sent four warships armed with cruise missiles to the region, and Obama will be presented with final options regarding actions against Syria in the next few days, a senior administration official said Monday. But as U.S. muscle plows the waters of the eastern Mediterranean Sea, al-Assad on Monday repeated his government's denial that his army had anything to do with the use of poison gas. ""The area of the claimed attack is in contiguity with the Syrian army positions, so how is it possible that any country would use chemical weapons in an area where its own forces are located?"" he asked in an interview with Russian newspaper Izvestia. Al-Assad accused the United States, Britain and France of exploiting the incident by trying to verify rebel allegations instead of verifying facts. The use of a large amount of chemical weapons would cross a ""red line"" and threaten U.S. interests in the region, Obama announced last year. Tabler, who has had extensive contacts with al-Assad, said the Syrian leader may have watched as Washington reacted cautiously to previous reports of chemical warfare and gambled incorrectly that last week's attack would draw a similar response. ""I think he thought that he could push the envelope again and that he could actually show his own people that no one is going to come to their rescue,"" Tabler said. Missile strikes on Syria likely response to chemical attack . Opposition accusations . Opposition members say rockets with chemical payloads were among the ordnance government troops unleashed at the rebel stronghold of Ghouta early Wednesday. More than 1,300 people died, most of them by gas, according to opposition spokesman Khaled al-Saleh. The opposition backed up the allegations with gruesome video of rows of dead bodies, including women and children. They had no visible wounds, and some appeared to be bloated. The aid agency Medecins sans Frontieres said three hospitals it supports in Syria's Damascus governorate reported having received about 3,600 patients displaying neurotoxic symptoms on Wednesday morning. But according to Syrian state-run television's depiction of events, government forces came into contact with a gas attack on Saturday in Jobar, on the edge of Damascus. Several of the soldiers were ""suffocating"" from exposure to gases as they entered the city, according to state TV. ""It is believed that the terrorists have used chemical weapons in the area,"" Syrian TV reported, citing an anonymous source. The government uses the term ""terrorists"" to describe rebel forces. Broadcast video showed a room containing gas masks, gas canisters and other paraphernalia that could be used in a gas attack. The army said it uncovered the cache in a storage facility in the area. CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of video shown by the government or rebels.

"(CNN) -- More than a week after the grand jury's decision in Ferguson, protests continue nationwide. On campuses, in malls, on streets and in stadiums, Americans young and old are voicing their anger about the non-indictments in the deaths of Michael Brown and now Eric Garner in New York -- and about the rigged system that makes such results all too common. This proliferation of protests is good. But it's not good enough. First, let's reflect a bit on why it's good. Anytime Americans start seeing themselves as more than mere consumers or spectators -- rather, as citizens and participants -- something healthy is happening. That's especially true when people are willing to flex their citizen muscles during the start of peak shopping season. So seeing protesters from Seattle to New York engage in civil disobedience on Black Friday was heartening. Did all the walk-outs and ""die-ins"" inconvenience some shoppers and deal-seekers? Sure. The post-Ferguson moment demands, at a bare minimum, that we all raise our sights beyond one-day sale tags. But while the protests are promising and necessary, they are also insufficient. A deeper phase of work is needed. And here all of America can learn from what's already been happening in Missouri. The media has tended to focus on the most eye-catching conflict -- either daytime marches with famous activists, or nighttime rioting after the grand jury decision. But off-camera, people on the ground in and around this community have been doing something simple and difficult. They've been moving from protest to power. Faith groups and grassroots organizers like Communities Creating Opportunity and the Organization for Black Struggle have, since this summer, been engaging people in Ferguson to organize and advocate for reforms, to register, to vote, to understand the makeup and the methods of the city council and the state legislature. In short, to do politics. This may seem unsatisfying to some, even irrelevant. The members of the millennial generation who are driving so many of the protests today are idealistic and networked -- but also exceedingly cynical about traditional politics and government. And young African-Americans who are most often subjected to arbitrary abuses by the criminal justice system have the most reason to be mistrustful of the larger political machinery that begat that system. But what the grassroots organizers in Ferguson teach us is that there is no avoiding politics. Indeed, there is no way to achieve any scaled and durable reform without stepping into the arena of government, policy, politics, and elections. A change in city council representation can lead to a change in how truly representative one's police force is. A well-coordinated campaign to let elected officials know you are part of a collective with voice, clout, savvy, and votes can lead to a change in attitude among those elected -- and then to changes in policy. What this requires is an understanding of the institutions that govern how we govern ourselves. What it requires is literacy in civic power. This is why the organization I run, Citizen University, is working with partners around the country to teach people about the skills and systems of power. And it's why everyone, left or right -- and especially those living on the front lines of racial disparity and violent inequity -- must learn how to read and to write power. Wherever you live, ask yourself: Could I teach someone what the activists in Ferguson are teaching people now? Could I teach them how my city makes policy, how politicians respond to public pressure, how to navigate the rules of voting, how to make votes cancel out money? All around the world, from Tahrir Square a few years ago to Hong Kong today, we see young people caught up in what one journalist called ""the euphoria of defiance."" Alas, in most of those situations, we also see what happens when protesters are unable to convert civil disobedience into civil self-rule. That requires strategy. It requires organization. It requires patient instruction in citizenship. Fifty-nine years ago this week, Rosa Parks made a heroic choice not to sit at the back of the bus. But what her story teaches us is this: Heroes are what happens when a moment calls forth people well prepared by institutions. Parks did not arrive randomly at that occasion on that bus. She had been groomed by an ecosystem of civil rights groups like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, trained at places like the Highlander Folk School. She had understood her choice -- her immovable defiance -- to be part of a larger story and a methodical strategy for the attainment of power. This is what unsung but undaunted citizen organizers and educators are doing in Ferguson today. They've moved past ""Hands Up, Don't Shoot"" gestures. They are getting hands-on about changing their community. And so should we all. That's how we can make this a season of powerful citizenship.","Eric Liu: Protests over Ferguson are promising, but also insufficient.
Everyone, left or right, must learn how to read and to write power: Liu .
Liu: Rosa Parks understood her choice to be part of a larger story ."
"Syrian President Bashar al-Assad told a French magazine that ""there haven't been any tangible"" signs that U.S.-led airstrikes in his country have weakened ISIS, despite assertions Wednesday by America's top diplomat that ""significant progress"" has been made in derailing the Islamist extremist group. In an interview with Paris Match, a portion of which was published online Wednesday, al-Assad said his government has ""noticed no change"" in ISIS since the air campaign began more than two months ago. ""It isn't true that the strikes are helpful,"" the Syrian President said. ""They would, of course, have helped had they been serious and efficient."" After first striking ISIS targets in Iraq, the U.S.-led coalition went after the group inside Syria in September. These efforts haven't been coordinated with al-Assad's government, which U.S. and other Western leaders have said they want replaced -- even going as far, in some cases, as supporting and working with moderate opposition forces fighting to unseat him. Airstrikes mark shift in coalition focus to ISIS 'capital' Yet al-Assad said in his Paris Match interview, which took place on November 28 in Damascus and will be published in full Thursday, that the U.S.-led military campaign has limited use because ""you can't end terrorism with aerial strikes. Troops on the ground that know the land and can react are essential."" Whether or not the strikes have hurt ISIS, there's been little indication that they or anything else has gotten Syria closer to an end to a civil war that erupted after mostly peaceful protests in Daraa province in March 2011. Kerry says anti-ISIS coalition has made progress . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, however, offered a very different view of the anti-ISIS fight Wednesday. Addressing reporters in Brussels, Belgium, after a meeting of representatives from the 60 members of the coalition, Kerry said various efforts -- from more than 1,000 airstrikes to sanctions -- have significantly hampered ISIS in the Middle East. ""There was a consensus that the momentum which it had exhibited 2½ months ago has been halted,"" he said. ISIS ""has been forced to modify its tactics, and some of those modifications are severely hampering their ability to operate in the way that they were."" He added that the coalition has taken important steps in ""defeating (ISIS) on the battlefield, restricting its finances, enacting laws to restrict the flow of foreign fighters and countering its toxic ideology."" The airstrikes are part of that overall strategy, and they show no signs of letting up. U.S. Central Command said that between Monday and Wednesday of this week, there were 14 coalition airstrikes in Syria -- all of them near Kobani, the city near the Turkish border that in recent weeks has become a key battleground in the ongoing fight -- in addition to 11 such strikes inside Iraq. Conflicting figures . The United Nations has estimated more than 100,000 people have died in the Syrian civil war. Yet the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the toll is much higher, claiming Tuesday that it's more than 200,000 people -- among them about 63,000 civilians, 45,000 Syrian troops and more than 50,000 rebel fighters. Millions more have been displaced inside Syria by the violence, with the United Nations estimating up to 1.8 million refugees in neighboring Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt. And the situation may only get worse, after the U.N.'s World Food Program earlier this week announced the suspension of food vouchers for Syrian refugees because of a lack of funds. Scenes of devastation inside Kobani . Asked by Paris Match if he'd survive this war -- or if he would have the same fate as once entrenched but later deposed leaders Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Moammar Gadhafi in Libya -- al-Assad said, ""The captain doesn't think about death or life, he thinks about saving his ship. If he thinks about sinking, everyone will die."" Al-Assad insisted that his goal has never been to remain President indefinitely, adding, ""I am doing my best to save the country."" ""Regardless (of) what happens, we as Syrians will never allow our country to become a toy in Western hands,"" he said. ""It is a fundamental principle for us.""","U.S.-led coalition carries out 14 more airstrikes near Kobani, Syria .

"Crammed into a prison cell with 36 other people, the man debated his fate as he listened to the shelling. Outside, fighters with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria fired mortars at the anti-terrorism detention facility in Tal Afar, where fierce battles raged between the al Qaeda splinter group and Iraqi security forces. With the facility close to being overrun by ISIS fighters, the prison guards did the unthinkable. ""At about 2 a.m., three of the guards came into our cell ... and they opened fire with a machine gun,"" the man said in a video obtained by CNN. The account mirrors allegations put forward by Amnesty International, which released a report Friday saying it has evidence pointing to a pattern of ""extrajudicial executions"" of Sunni detainees by government forces and Shiite militias in Tal Afar, Mosul and Baquba, cities where Iraqi forces were either routed or have been locked in fierce battles with ISIS fighters and allied Sunni militants. ""The killings suggest a worrying pattern of reprisal attacks against Sunnis in retaliation for ISIS gains,"" said Donatella Rovera, Amnesty International's senior crisis response adviser, who is currently in northern Iraq. The government is aware of the Amnesty International allegations but has yet to see any evidence, said Abdul-Sittar al-Birqdar, spokesman for the Supreme Judicial Council, which oversees the country's judicial system. ""At this stage, this is all just media reporting,"" he told CNN on Friday. ""No witnesses have come forward, and no families have come forward with such claims. No one has officially asked for an investigation."" He called for the rights group to provide evidence, saying that ""we are still monitoring and checking, and we will keep checking,"" adding that ""under Iraqi law, we cannot move on it without claims and evidence."" 'He was in the prison. He was killed' Survivors and witnesses tell Amnesty International that Iraqi prison guards carried out the slaughter before Iraqi forces withdrew. A video obtained by CNN, confirmed by Amnesty International as one of the rooms where the killings took place in Tal Afar, shows a prison cell, the floor slick with blood, where bodies of men are piled on top of one another. They appear to have fallen where they were shot. In that same video, a woman in a black abaya with a printed head scarf stands over her brother, brushing flies from his body. She said she found his body among others in a room in the Tal Afar detention facility. ""He was in the prison,"" said the woman, clearly in shock. ""He was killed."" Asked how many bodies were among those with her brother, she said: ""They killed a lot. I don't know."" Bodies found in Mosul . A similar scene appeared to play out at the anti-terrorism detention facility in Mosul, 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Tal Afar, Amnesty International said, where some of the dozens of bloated, twisted bodies found in a ditch were believed to have been executed by Iraqi guards before they withdrew. A man, whom CNN is not identifying at his request, said he was being held at the same facility with about 80 others. He said he was held without charges after security forces picked him up eight months earlier. ""The guards were screaming out names. They took 15 of them and handcuffed them together,"" said the man, who is a university student. Then they were taken away, he said. Later, as ISIS fighters shelled the Mosul facility, detainees in one of the cells began chanting ""Allahu akbar."" That's when, the man said, one of the guards opened a cell and threw a grenade into it. ""Thank God, they were busy with the clashes, and they didn't have time to go through all the cells,"" he said. The man said militants, presumably ISIS fighters, eventually released him and the other prisoners. ""They said, 'You are free. Whoever wants to go, swear allegiance to us and you can go home,' "" he said. The man said that when he heard that bodies had been found in a ditch near an abandoned potato factory, he went to see them. And there, he said, were the bodies of some of the men taken from the detention facility. Human Rights Watch details alleged ISIS killings . Stories of executions and killings by both sides have swirled since ISIS fighters seized portions of northern Iraq in a lightning advance that stunned Iraqi security forces. The Amnesty International report comes the same day that Human Rights Watch said two mass graves thought to contain the bodies of Iraqi soldiers, police and civilians, killed by ISIS fighters and their militant allies, were found in Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit. Using satellite imagery and publicly available photographs purportedly released by ISIS, Human Rights Watch said it appeared that ISIS fighters in Tikrit executed three groups of men a short distance from the former Iraqi leader's Water Palace on the banks of the Tigris River. ""The analysis suggests that ISIS killed between 160 and 190 men in at least two locations between June 11 and 14,"" the rights group said in its report. ""The number of victims may well be much higher, but the difficulty of locating bodies and accessing the area has prevented a full investigation."" Who is the ISIS?

"It was a routine call for the Norwegian fighter pilot participating in NATO's Quick Reaction Alert mission, high in the sky off Norway's coast. He was tasked with investigating and identifying an aircraft that had entered the mission's patrol area in international airspace northwest of Norway. Fluffy clouds dotted the piercing blue atmosphere, and it looked like it would be a non-eventful mission, until something gray darted in front of the Norwegian pilot's F-16 -- a Russian MiG fighter, according to the Norwegian Defence Ministry. ""What the hell!"" is a loose, relatively polite translation of what he's heard saying on video released by Norwegian military. ""He was surprised and he expressed it,"" Norwegian Navy Cmdr. Gens Hoilund told CNN Wednesday in a telephone interview. The video appears to be recorded from the Norwegian jet's own camera, and shows the Russian fighter in the lower right quadrant of the shot.  The Norwegian aircraft then banks sharply to the left to maneuver away from the MiG. The encounter took place sometime in the past two years, Hoilund said. The video was released to show just ""an example of the kind of situations that our pilots flying the NATO QRA missions can encounter,"" said Capt. Brynjar Stordal, information officer for the National Joint Headquarters Norway, in a statement Wednesday. ""We do not know if this incident was caused by the Russian pilot miscalculating the distance to the Norwegian fighter, or if it was an intentional maneuver. There have been a few incidents like this over the years, but I would like to press that the majority of the (identifications) made by Norwegian fighters take place without incident,"" Stordal's statement added. Jet's behavior unusual . The Russian jet didn't appear to be acting in an aggressive manner, Hoilund said, but it's not clear what it was doing. ""He came too close (to the Norwegian fighter), but he was not aggressive,"" he said. Hoilund explained that a pilot he spoke to -- not the pilot in the video -- said it was an unusual situation, and that pilot couldn't recall any similar behavior in the recent past. ""When we observe unknown planes we identify them, so it was a normal mission for us to go and identify this plane,"" Hoilund said. There was no attempt to make radio contact with the Russian jet, he said. Stordal said it's important to note that Norway has not experienced the same increase in Russian air activity in its area of responsibility as has been seen by partners in the Baltic region. ""Last year we had 41 scrambles and identified 58 Russian aircraft. As of now, the numbers are 43/69 for 2014,"" the ministry statement said. NATO partners identify aircraft . The NATO Quick Reaction Alert mission tasks partners with patrolling the skies to identify suspicious aircraft. ""This enables the Alliance to detect, track and identify to the greatest extent possible all aerial objects approaching or operating within NATO airspace so that violations and infringements can be recognized, and the appropriate action taken,"" said a statement on NATO's website. U.S. official: 'Dangerous' Russian jet fly-by was 'straight out of a movie'","The Russian MiG was not aggressive, but its behavior was unusual .

"The 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals has stayed the execution of Texas death row inmate Scott Panetti, who was scheduled to be put to death at 6 p.m. Wednesday, according to the court clerk's office. Panetti's case has sparked debate for years over whether the state can execute someone who is severely mentally ill. During his trial for the 1992 slayings of his mother- and father-in-law, Panetti represented himself -- dressed in a purple cowboy outfit -- and called Jesus, John F. Kennedy and the Pope to the stand.  The now-56-year-old was convicted of shooting them to death at close range, in front of his wife and daughter. Panetti has suffered from schizophrenia for 30 years, his lawyers say, and he was hospitalized for mental illness numerous times before the murders. Attorney asked governor for stay . Though Panetti received initial evaluations of his mental health, his state of mind has deteriorated, his lawyer Kathryn Kase said. She noted in a letter to Gov. Rick Perry that Panetti hasn't received a mental evaluation in seven years. Kase asked that Perry grant a 30-day stay to the scheduled execution so that that an evaluation can be done to determine if he understands his punishment. It's not just Panetti's legal team that believes his execution would be a violation of the Constitution's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. Mental health professionals and advocates, members of the American Bar Association and representatives from the European Union have urged that he be spared. More than a dozen conservative leaders -- including a Washington Times opinion editor and a Ronald Reagan biographer -- have also written to Perry, asking that Panetti's execution be halted and his sentence be commuted to life in prison. ""Rather than serving as a measured response to murder, the execution of Mr. Panetti would only serve to undermine the public's faith in a fair and moral justice system,"" their letter reads. Ex-wife: He should never have stood trial . As a recent CNN opinion piece noted, Sonja Alvarado, Panetti's ex-wife and the daughter of his victims, filed a petition stating that because of Panetti's paranoid delusions when he committed the killings, he never should have faced trial. Opinion: The atrocity of killing a mentally ill man . ""If he's executed there should be a sense of outrage,"" said Ron Honberg, legal director for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. ""There's no question he's mentally ill. If this happens, the message would be -- 'we just don't care.' ""To execute him flies in the face of even supporters of the death penalty who say that it should be carried out with inmates who are the worst of the worst,"" Honberg continued. ""It would be much more compassionate and practical to spend money treating inmates with mental illness rather than execute this man."" Clemency denied . The Texas Board of Pardons and Parole voted 7-0 to deny clemency in Panetti's case. There is still an appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court, in addition to the appeal the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals granted Wednesday. Panetti would be the 11th person Texas officials have executed in 2014. Columbia University psychiatry professor and American Psychiatric Association member Dr. Paul Appelbaum said that he's followed the case since 2007, when the U.S. Supreme Court stopped Panetti's execution and ruled that another competency review be performed. The 5th Circuit found in 2013 that Panetti was competent enough to be executed. Lately, American society has been engaged in a conversation about mental illness and the role of the death penalty for inmates who are not of sound mind, Appelbaum told CNN. ""We've come to understand that there is no legitimate penal reason to put such a person to death,"" he said. ""It's not likely to deter people from committing crimes and given Panetti's impairment, it's not a fitting punishment."" Death penalty fast facts .","Scott Panetti shot to death his mother- and father-in law .
He represented himself at trial, dressed like a cowboy, called Jesus to the stand .

"President Barack Obama met Wednesday with Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state and potential Democratic successor, for about an hour in the Oval Office, a White House official said. The event was not on Obama's schedule, and details on what the two discussed were scant. ""As is well known, President Obama and Secretary Clinton enjoy getting together in person on a regular basis. This afternoon they met privately in the Oval Office for about an hour to catch-up and enjoy an informal discussion on a wide range of issues,"" the White House official said. Nick Merrill, Clinton's spokesman, told CNN in an email that her camp will ""defer to the White House on any details."" It's the first time the two have met in person since August, when they both attended a party at the Martha's Vinyard home of Vernon Jordan, an aide to former President Bill Clinton. Obama was vacationing there with his family, and Clinton was there for a book signing event. More recently, Clinton has backed Obama's decision to overhaul immigration rules and forestall deportations for the undocumented parents of U.S. citizens through executive action.

"President Barack Obama is going to a top group of American business leaders Wednesday, where he's hoping to make his pitch for his agenda to the business community ahead of an incoming Republican majority in Congress. Obama will tout economic gains in the private sector at a meeting of the Business Roundtable in Washington, where he's also looking for support to advance issues like tax reform, trade and infrastructure, a White House official said. The group, an association of top U.S. CEOs whose companies employ more than 16 million people, is a powerful force on Capitol Hill, spending more than $12 million in lobbying in 2013 according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The organization could be an important ally for Obama on key issues as he looks to bridge the gap with Republicans on issues with some common ground, like tax reform. While traditionally backing Republican candidates and policies, the business community hasn't pushed back as strongly against Obamacare as the GOP and have pushed leaders on Capitol Hill to rally around comprehensive immigration reform. And Obama will need to keep business leaders on his side over the public fight over Obamacare that is sure to flame up as the employer mandate kicks in at the beginning of next year. Obama could generate some good will as he spotlights the economic gains of his presidency: 10.6 million jobs added to the economy in 56 months, a booming stock market and near-record corporate profits, the White House official said. ""As the President has said, he is eager to work with the new Congress wherever possible to make the next two years as productive as possible, and will look to the business community as a partner in these efforts to continue to grow our economy and create opportunity,"" the official said. The official did not mention immigration reform, but the topic could come up as he takes questions from a group of business leaders during the event that comes just weeks after Obama announced his executive actions to reform the immigration system and give legal status to more than 4 million undocumented immigrants. Like other business groups, Business Roundtable didn't fully embrace Obama's executive action, though the group didn't rebuke it as Republican leaders did and the group's policy director on immigration has said he's hopeful Obama and Congressional Republicans can work together to pass immigration legislation. Obama's meeting with the business group comes just hours before he meets with incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon.","President Barack Obama is scheduled to meet with the Business Roundtable group .

"One day after executing dozens of non-Muslims at a quarry in Kenya, the Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab waged an attack in its home base of Somalia -- killing at least four people, according to police, in an attack on a United Nations convoy. Three of those killed in Wednesday morning's attack near Mogadishu's airport were civilians and another was a security force member, Police Col. Mohamed Hassan said. ""I saw at least two dead bodies lying in a pool of blood on the ground, and police arrived soon at the area and began shooting in the air to disperse the crowds,"" a witness named Sharma'arke said by phone from the scene. A plume of black smoke could be seen rising from the airport, which also acts as a staging ground for United Nations operations and for the African Union troops on a peacekeeping mission in Somalia. Two United Nations vehicles were damaged, a U.N. official said, but no U.N. staff members were killed or injured. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for what spokesman Sheikh Abdiaziz Abu Musab called ""a sacred bomb attack"" targeting ""foreign mercenaries and U.N. staff."" Abu Musab said this action had claimed the lives of ""several Somali soldiers and foreigners working with U.N.,"" but he did not specify a number of dead or their nationalities. Such violence -- in Somalia and carried out by Al-Shabaab -- is hardly unprecedented. The group has been active in East Africa for years, waging an armed campaign that initially aimed to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Yet Al-Shabaab, which the United States designated as a foreign terrorist organization in March 2008, hasn't confined its targets to Somali authorities. Its militants have also killed international aid workers, journalists, civilian leaders and African Union peacekeepers. Somali and allied AU forces have pushed back, even forcing Al-Shabaab from its last major stronghold in Barawe in early October, according to residents and military commanders. Yet they haven't stopped the group entirely, as evidenced by a deadly car bombing outside a popular Mogadishu restaurant one week after that milestone. And it's not as though Al-Shabaab is confining itself to Somalia. The terrorist group -- whose then-leader, Ahmed Godane, pledged allegiance to al Qaeda in 2012 -- has been active elsewhere in Africa as well. Its bombers attacked bars and restaurants in the Ugandan capital of Kampala on the night of the 2010 World Cup final, killing more than 60 people. And last fall, Al-Shabaab militants casually walked into the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, and began gunning down shoppers -- allegedly torturing some hostages before killing them. The four-day-long siege ended with as many as 67 dead and parts of the mall destroyed. Last month, authorities said at least 28 died after Al-Shabaab ambushed a bus in Kenya and sprayed bullets on those who failed to recite Quran verses. And on Tuesday, the group's militants raided a quarry in the Kenyan village of Kormey, near the Somali border, separating non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and executing them, group spokesman Sheikh Ali Dheere said in a statement read on a pro-Al-Shabaab radio station in Somalia. At least 36 bodies were found dumped in the quarry, according to the Kenyan Red Cross.","Police: 3 of those killed were civilians; 1 was a security force member .

The young staffer, now 33, is credited for making Obama ""hip"" by showing him how to fist bump, introducing him to Jay-Z and buying him an iPod. He even surprised the President on his 49th birthday for a game of basketball alongside LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Dwyane Wade. According to the President, new trends and technology can't replace Reggie's work ethic. In a 2010 interview with The New York Times, Obama admitted that he didn't have an iPad, rather opting for his ""iReggie, who has my books, my newspapers, my music all in one place."" Unlike the dreadful boss-personal assistant relationship many can attest to, Love became Obama's personal confidant and friend. During the raid that ended with the killing of Osama bin Laden, a tension-filled Obama found Love, Marvin Nicholson, another aide, and White House photographer Pete Souza, in the private dining room. To help the President pass the time, they played about ""15 games of spades,"" Love has said. Love first started working for Obama in the Senate back in 2006. He quickly climbed the ranks from staff assistant to ""body man,"" a nickname given to him by the administration. Spending countless hours alongside the President, Love quickly became more than an aide, fostering a relationship that has led the Obama to call him his ""little brother."" ""Over the years, Reggie has been a friend, a teammate and an indispensable member of my staff,"" Obama said in a statement announcing Love's departure in 2011. ""From my Senate office to the White House, his ability to juggle so many responsibilities with so little sleep has been an inspiration to watch. He is the master of what he does."" Love's book is set to hit stores on Feb. 3.","President Barack Obama's most notable aide, Reggie Love, is releasing a book .

"There was no bourbon, but Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the incoming majority leader, still sounded upbeat about his White House meeting with President Barack Obama Wednesday. ""We had a good conversation about a variety of different issues where we might possibly find common ground,"" McConnell told CNN about the meeting, which was only the third private meeting he's had with the President since Obama has been in office. McConnell, speaking when he returned to the Capitol, said he didn't want to say anymore about the specific issues they discussed or characterize the meeting any further. The session lasted about an hour, relatively short considering the heavy load of thorny issues the two men must work on together over the next two years. When he returned to the Capitol, a smiling McConnell was asked by CNN if he was given any bourbon, a drink the President recently joked he'd enjoy having with the senator who represents a state famous for its bourbon whiskey. ""No, this was not the bourbon summit,"" he chuckled. ""But I'm still hoping we'll have it.""","President Barack Obama and Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell met for their third private meeting on Wednesday .

"(CNN)""Go, go, go!"" There's no need for the driving instructor to repeat his brief command when the go pedal in question is attached to a ravishing red Ferrari F430 with a majestic exhaust note. Swinging onto a four-lane highway just outside Ferrari's Maranello headquarters in Italy, there's the heady sensation of accelerating through the gears as the big V8 engine barks and crackles in response. But up ahead of us, a police car in the slow lane brings our rapid progress back down to a more leisurely speed. No matter -- there's a chance to repeat the experience a couple more times during the drive. It's all part of the experience in Italy's ""Motor Valley,"" an area that runs broadly between the towns of Modena, Maranello and Bologna, and encompasses the museums, showrooms and factories of such supercar names as Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini and Pagani, plus Ducati for motorbike enthusiasts. This is the place for anyone whose engine is fired by new high-performance sports cars with bodies by Zagato, Bertone and Pininfarina. In Maranello, it's a case of pay your money and take a drive in your pick of red Ferraris: F430, California T, F458, F599 and F12 Berlinetta. That's 100 euros ($125) for 20 minutes in the F430, 350 euros for 60 minutes in the California or 1,500 euros for two hours in the F12. And there are Lamborghini and Maserati options for those looking beyond a Ferrari. 'California Dreaming' Most people come to Maranello to visit the Museo Ferrari (Via Dino Ferrari, 43, Maranello; +39 0536 949713) a red-on-red extravaganza of F1 grand prix cars, sports racers from the 1950s through to the 1970s, unique concept cars and up-to-the-minute Ferrari models such as the FF and LaFerrari. The current exhibition on the theme ""California Dreaming"" has rooms devoted to Ferrari's involvement in Hollywood, Los Angeles, the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance and Silicon Valley technology. Apart from viewing the fabulous car collection, there's the opportunity to try an F1 simulator or become part of a tire-change pit crew racing against the clock. Buying a combined ticket at Maranello also gives entry to Modena's Museo Enzo Ferrari (Modena, Via Paolo Ferrari, 85, Modena;+ 39 059 4397979 ), a yellow turtle-shaped building that tells the life story of the Ferrari founder through a marvelous collection of the cars he drove and created. This museum is, until January 2015, given over to an exhibition of 100 years of Maserati (the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles group now owns both Ferrari and Maserati), featuring 21 classic vehicles that include the 1932 V4 Sport Zagato, a 1955 300 S sports racer and a 2006 MC12 GT1. Next door to the museum is the house where Enzo Ferrari was born. While the Maserati exhibition is on, the ground floor of the house is hosting such notable vehicles as the first car to bear the Ferrari name -- the 1947 125 S -- plus a 1952 500 F2 single-seat racer and a 1954 750 Monza. For Maserati devotees, there are an equally impressive range of cars at the privately-owned Umberto Panini Collection (Hombre dairy farm, Via Corletto Sud 320, 41100 Modena; +39 059 510660), housed on the Hombre organic dairy farm on the outskirts of Modena. This was part of the original Maserati Museum collection that was to be sold at auction in London at the end of 1996, before the Panini family stepped in to ensure the cars stayed in Italy. It includes such rarities as a 1936 6 CM, a 1934 6 C, a 1953 A6 GCS Berlinetta, Type 61 and Type 63 Birdcage sports racers and the 1990 Chubasco prototype, along with the 1958 402M El Dorado that Stirling Moss raced at Monza. Cars and cheese . There's an extra incentive to visit this free museum: the chance to buy some of its distinctive Parmigiano Reggiano cheese . Two museums cater to Lamborghini lovers: Museo Lamborghini (Via Modena, 12, Sant'Agata Bolognese; +39 051 6817.611) at the company's Sant'Agata Bolognese factory midway between Modena and Bologna, and the family-owned Ferruccio Lamborghini Museo at Funo, a little to the north of Bologna. With Lamborghini now part of the Volkswagen group, its factory museum has an outstanding range of vehicles on display. These include the first production 350 GT, and such recent creations as the 2010 Sesto Elemento (Sixth Element) lightweight track car and the 2013 Egoista single seater that's based on a Gallardo but takes its design cues -- canopy style door and a body made of anti-radar material -- from either a jet fighter or an Apache attack helicopter, depending on your perspective. Right behind the Sesto Elemento sits a police highway patrol Gallardo. Classic early Lamborghini models on display include the 1996 Miura (and its 2006 reinterpretation), the Countach, Jalpa and Diablo. The Ferruccio Lamborghini museum (Ferrucio Lamborghini Museo: Via Galliera n. 319/F, Funo di Argelato, Bologna;+39 051 86 26 28) displays more of the industrialist family's beginnings in tractors, but includes a replica of the 1963 Lamborghini GTV prototype, examples of the Miura, Countach, Espada, Diablo and military SUVs, plus Lamborghini-powered offshore racing boats and the TownLife microcar created by Ferruccio's son Tonino. At San Cesario sul Panaro, near the town of Castelfranco Emilia on the Modena-Bologna rail line, supercar newcomer Pagani has a showroom (Via dell'Artigianato, 5, Vill. La Graziosa, San Cesario sul Panaro; +39 059 4739201) with examples of its Huayra and Zonda models on display. Power, passion, performance . By arrangement, it's possible to join a tour of the Pagani factory. For those with the time, there are two more destinations in Italy for car lovers. There's Brescia, home of the Museo Mille Miglia (Museo Mille Miglia, Brescia: Viale della Bornata, 123 Eufemia, Brescia; + 39 030 336 5631) that celebrates the history of the 1,000-mile road race that ran from Brescia to Rome and back between 1927 and 1957, and Turin, where the National Automobile Museum (Corso Unità d'Italia 40,Turin;+39 11 677666/7/8) )has reopened after a lengthy renovation. As befits Italy's premier car museum, Turin is a tour de force of automotive history and creativity: 160 models from 80 different makers, thematically arranged to cover design, production, sporting achievements and technological change. From the first car to appear on Italian roads (the 1892 Peugeot Type 3) to the 1907 Itala 35/45 HP that won the 1907 Peking-Paris race, through to the 1948 Cisitalia 202 ""rolling sculpture,"" the 1952 Alfa Romeo Disco Volante (Flying Saucer) and the latest Vittoria concept car, this is a masterful collection. There's a bonus on Sundays, the one day of the week when Fiat opens its free Centro Storico (Historical Center) on Via Gabriele Chiabrera (Via Gabriele Chiabrera, 20, Turin; +39 011 006 6240). The center is home to a fascinating collection of cars, trains, planes, tractors, model ships and advertising memorabilia. Cars on display include the first 3.5 HP Fiat, the monstrous 1924 land speed record holder Mefistofele, classics such as the 1929 Fiat 525 SS -- rated one of the most beautiful vehicles of its era -- and the post-war Fiat 8V and Fiat 1100 S Mille Miglia. For enthusiasts enamored of the power, passion, performance and panache of Italian motoring, these eight museums well and truly deliver on their promise. Buon viaggio! Getting behind the wheel .

"With six years and dozens of Cabinet nominations under his belt, President Barack Obama has learned that first picks don't always work out. That lesson, introduced before he even took office, is only made clearer by the process of replacing outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. The top names on the White House ""shortlist"" -- which included former high-ranking Pentagon official Michele Flournoy, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Jack Reed -- all withdrew themselves from consideration. Obama's expected pick, former Pentagon number two Ashton Carter, was on the shortlist too. But reports he'd been selected for the job only emerged after the others dropped out. The letdown of going with second (or third) choices for Cabinet positions isn't new for Obama. Here are other first picks who didn't make it: . Susan Rice -- Secretary of State . When Secretary of State Hillary Clinton left her post following Obama's re-election in 2012, Susan Rice quickly emerged as the frontrunner to replace her. Then the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Rice was seen as a close Obama confidante who had earned the his trust beginning with her work as a policy adviser during the 2008 campaign. But her prospects of becoming the nation's top diplomat faded amid uproar over her statements about the September 2012 attacks on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, which Republicans claimed were misleading. Obama consistently defended Rice from the attacks, even saying that if Republicans wanted to go after someone in the administration on Benghazi, ""they should go after me."" But anticipating a drawn-out and rancorous confirmation process on Capitol Hill, Rice withdrew her name from consideration. In a letter to Obama, she wrote ""the confirmation process would be lengthy, disruptive, and costly -- to you and to our most pressing national and international priorities. That trade-off is simply not worth it to our country."" Obama eventually picked then-Sen. John Kerry for the post, and Rice moved into the White House as the president's National Security Adviser. Tom Daschle -- Health and Human Services secretary . Before he was even sworn into office, Obama had felt the sting of a first-choice nominee being stymied by controversy. Tom Daschle, the former Senate Majority Leader from South Dakota, had been a staunch and important supporter of Obama's, endorsing him almost a year before early primaries and caucuses in 2008. His name (along with many others) was even floated as a potential vice presidential pick. When it came time to name a nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, Daschle was a natural choice. Obama announced his pick in December 2008, after he had won the election but before he took office. Two months later, the nomination was in shambles: Daschle admitted failing to report $15,000 in charitable donations and conceded he hadn't reported using a car service. That was after he was forced to pay $140,000 in back taxes. Recognizing the political firestorm ahead, Daschle withdrew his nomination. Later, Obama admitted he made a mistake in how he handled the process. ""I think I screwed up,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""And I take responsibility for it and we're going to make sure we fix it so it doesn't happen again."" Later that month, Obama nominated Kathleen Sebelius, then the governor of Kansas, to run his health agency. Bill Richardson and Judd Gregg -- Commerce Secretary . Commerce Secretary isn't typically the highest profile post in a president's administration. But in the early days of Obama's tenure the task of filling the job turned into multiple disappointments, as one candidate became embroiled in disclosure problems and another withdrew for ideological reasons. Bill Richardson, the former Clinton administration official who in 2008 was serving as governor of New Mexico, was Obama's first pick for Commerce. Former rivals during the Democratic primaries, Richardson endorsed Obama during the extended battle with Clinton. But the nomination process soured as federal investigators looked into Richardson's ties to a company that did business with his state. Richardson denied any wrongdoing, but said the extended probe would force an ""untenable delay"" in his confirmation process. Sen. Judd Gregg, a Republican from New Hampshire, was Obama's next pick. He was one of three Republicans Obama had asked to join his Cabinet in an attempt to convene a ""team of rivals"" in Washington. And while Obama likely anticipated some disagreements, Gregg eventually realized their differences would be impossible to overcome. He withdrew his nomination citing ""irresolvable conflicts"" with Obama's economic plans, and said it had ""obviously"" been a mistake to accept the nomination in the first place. Gary Locke, who had served as governor of Washington State, was the third -- and final -- pick for the job. Sanjay Gupta -- Surgeon General . Shortly after taking office, Obama considered tapping neurosurgeon and CNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta as his surgeon general. Aides said Gupta was Obama's top choice for the post, which is the nation's highest-ranking official for public health issues but isn't a Cabinet-level position. But after speaking with senior members of Obama's administration, Gupta withdrew his name, saying he would have been forced to give up practicing medicine to take the job. He told Larry King he felt flattered to have been considered for the job, but that the timing was inconvenient. It wasn't for another four months that Obama named his eventual pick, Alabama physician Regina Benjamin.","Obama is expected to nominate Ashton Carter as defense secretary .

"Darren Wilson has lived in the shadows for nearly four months, changing residence from house to house, spending spare time in dark movie theaters, in hopes he won't be spotted. But he has not sneaked around alone. He has had protectors. Fellow officers have been by his side day and night, as deadly threats have driven the former Ferguson police officer into hiding, after he shot unarmed teen Michael Brown in August. ""Fraternal Order of Police members from the surrounding area volunteered and have provided him with security from that time, right up until the present,"" FOP spokesman Jim Pasco told CNN. They had to, because Ferguson police were either ""unwilling or unable"" to protect Wilson, Pasco alleged. It was the department's duty, he said. ""That's what the police department's supposed to do."" CNN has reached out for comment on Pasco's claim to the Ferguson police department but has not heard back. The volunteer officers are guarding Wilson in their off-duty time -- without pay, Pasco said. Sitting duck . Early talk of cyberstalking drove Wilson underground. He was pushing a lawn mower days after the shooting, when he was told his home address was circulating online. He realized he was a sitting duck. ""He had to leave the grass, literally, half mowed,"" his lawyer, Neil Bruntrager told CNN. Wilson stuffed belongings into bags, and three hours later, he began a life out of sight. ""He's had to learn to live in a way that makes him completely unnoticeable,"" Bruntrager said. He joked that his client ""cross-dressed a lot."" Despite the circumstances, he did manage to get married last month, and his wife, a Ferguson police officer, is pregnant and now on leave. Cyberstalking . The stalking has snowballed. Deadly threats have poured in via phone, e-mail and social media. ""There were bounties that had been placed upon his life,"" Bruntrager said. And threats were aimed not just against him. On Monday, the FBI arrested Seattle area man, Jaleel Tariq Abdul-Jabbaar, after he allegedly posted multiple death threats to Facebook against a Ferguson police officer with the initials D.W. -- and his family, according to the arrest complaint. ""Are there any REAL BLACK MEN that would love to go down to Ferguson Missouri to give back those bullets that Police Officer [D.W.] fired into the body of Mike Brown. If we're unable to locate Officer [D.W.] then We'll return them to his wife and if not her then his children,"" one post read. The threats crossed state lines, making them an interstate threat, the federal offense listed on the complaint. Abdul-Jabbaar also sent messages that he was trying to get his hands on a gun and that he would be traveling to Ferguson, the document said. Stalkers will likely make it hard for Wilson to be safe for a while, said law enforcement legal expert Ron Hosko. ""There are cyber-activists in our world who are going to be actively trying to find out, where is Darren Wilson? They're going to be trying to find out: Where did Darren Wilson spend his last dollar? -- so that they can track and put out in public where he is and really create an enhanced threat to him,"" he said. Perpetual guardians . Concern for safety drove Wilson to quit Ferguson's police force -- the safety of his colleagues, he said. ""I have been told that my continued employment may put the residents and police officers of the City of Ferguson at risk, which is a circumstance that I cannot allow,"" he wrote in his letter of resignation. But another attorney for Wilson told The Washington Post that Wilson's own safety also had a lot to do with his decision to leave. ""I think I expressed to him, 'Do you realize your first call (back on the job) will be to a blind alley where you're executed?' He took a pause for a minute, thought about it and said, 'Oh.' That is the reality,"" attorney James Towey told the paper. Wilson will have to keep up his low profile. So will his guardians, Hosko said. No marked cars in front of the house, no large groups of off-duty officers. ""Maybe one person, maybe two people, so that Officer Wilson - former officer Wilson - can sleep at night,"" he said. Pasco is keeping the details of Wilson's protection under his hat. He said the officers would keep it up ""as long as we have to."" What's next for Wilson?","Deadly drove the former Ferguson police officer into hiding after he shot Michael Brown .

It will include other imagery like the iconic four-color PlayStation logo that harks back to the system's history. ""The mid-'90s were an exciting time for game developers, driven by the explosion of powerful but affordable 3-D graphics rendering hardware and the birth of many young and adventurous development studios,"" Shuhei Yoshida, president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios, wrote in the post on the PlayStation blog. ""The original PlayStation was meant to embody that sense of adventure and discovery, that sense that anything was possible.""

"The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has launched a space probe on a mission to collect a sample from a distant asteroid. The launch of the Hayabusa-2 probe took place early Wednesday local time from Japan's Tanegashima Space Center, JAXA said on its website. The agency said its target was an asteroid called ""1999 JU3."" The mission was to land on the asteroid and use instruments to draw samples from it that could shed light on ""the origin and evolution of the solar system,"" the agency said. The mission is a successor to the Hayabusa probe, which was launched in 2003 and returned to Earth in 2010, but failed to successfully drop a lander on its target asteroid. ""1999 JU3"" was a ""C-type"" asteroid,  a ""more primordial body"" than the asteroid targeted by the Hayabusa 2's predecessor, said JAXA, and as such it was expected to contain more organic or hydrated material for study. ""We expect to clarify the origin of life by analyzing samples acquired from a primordial celestial body such as a C-type asteroid to study organic matter and water in the solar system,"" JAXA said in a statement.","Japan's space agency has launched a probe to a distant asteroid .

"(CNN)If you're considering going to Olive Garden for the third time this week, stop right now and consider some creative alternatives. Instead, visit one of these wacky restaurants for unique dining experiences that put good fun, fantasy and more on the menu. Trailer Park Lounge, New York . If a bathtub full of beer bottles and the Elvis and Dolly Parton memorabilia don't make you feel like you're in a trailer park at the Trailer Park Lounge, the literal side of a trailer mounted on the wall will. Chow down on a thick sloppy joe, Frito and tater tot chili or a classic Double-Wide burger before enjoying a Moon Pie for dessert. Make sure you bring your camera to truly capture the kitschy dive bar atmosphere. Really get into the mood with a giant margarita, the signature ""Jim Bob's I.Q."" (a surreptitious stab at TLC's ""19 Kids and Counting"" patriarch) or some good old PBR. Safe House, Milwaukee, Wisconsin . Whether you're an actual escaped convict or just someone who wants to play spy for the day, the secrecy surrounding Milwaukee's Safe House is enough to get anyone's blood pumping. After 8 p.m., guests need a password to confirm that they are friends, not foes. As the website says, ""Hint ... Control never turned away agents on the run because they didn't know the password."" Not only is the uber-spy atmosphere an experience in and of itself, but customers can also play blackjack and enjoy an intriguing magic show while they eat. The upscale cuisine includes dishes like the Sean Connery (herb-buttered flame-broiled steak) and the Soviet Defector (beer-braised baby back ribs). If you become obsessed with Safe House, you can jump up a clearance level by joining the Very Important Operatives membership group, which offers discounts and your own code name. Dick's Last Resort, multiple U.S. locations . Many restaurant-goers would complain if their servers insulted them. Not at Dick's Last Resort, where the restaurant's theme is just that: Staff members who intentionally act like, uh, jerks. Customers take delight in the sarcasm and rudeness as they are forced to wear paper hats saying things like ""will give lap dances for $1"" and ""I eat the little chocolates out of the litter box."" Few jokes are off-limits as waiters direct customers to fake bathrooms and shout rude comments at guests and each other. Dick's has locations across the United States, from San Francisco to Orlando. As the website says, ""Dick's Last Resort is known for its outrageous, surly, and energetic servers who dish out good grub, cold booze and heaping helpings of sarcasm."" Just don't take your 4-year-old here unless you'd like to add some words to her vocabulary. Ninja New York, New York . Sushi with a twist is a definite understatement when it comes to this 1800s-inspired Japanese dining experience. The dark New York restaurant is a mazelike ""ninja village,"" with iron bars and cold stone lining the walls. Guests travel down narrow corridors to be seated, and then, after ordering fresh sushi dishes, the fun begins. At any moment, a sleek ninja could jump out at you from a shadowy corner and scare you with a series of tricks or slight-of-hand illusions. Make sure to order a dish marked with a special presentation symbol to receive your meal with lights, fire or intricate karate chops. The Stinking Rose, San Francisco . Date night tip No. 1: Do not order anything garlicky ... unless you're at the Stinking Rose. This garlic-centered restaurant serves its eager customers more than 3,000 pounds of garlic every month. And the garlic fun is not limited to the food. The Stinking Rose's walls are adorned with animated garlic characters, and the restaurant is filled with garlic-themed collectibles. The world's largest garlic braid winds its way through the restaurant, keeping the pungent smell in the air as customers dine on garlic-filled dishes like Forty Clove Roasted Garlic Chicken and salmon in a lemon butter garlic caper sauce. Just think, if your date turns out to be a vampire, you'll be all set. Ellen's Stardust Diner, New York . Musical theater fans, 1950s throwback fans and general food fans alike flock to this one-of-a-kind Broadway dining experience that blurs the line between dinner and entertainment. With the slogan ""home of the singing waitstaff,"" the restaurant entertains guests with professional-level renditions of Broadway tunes and popular songs. Dishes like the Dean Martin (spaghetti and meatballs) and the Jerry Lee Lewis (a buffalo fried chicken and blue cheese wrap) highlight the diner's throwback vibe. There are 1950s-era films playing on authentic 1956 Predicta televisions to complete the transition to another world. Donny Dirk's Zombie Den, Minneapolis . The creepy undead reign at this Minneapolis bar, where a glass case reading ""in case of zombie attack, break glass"" encloses a chainsaw. The dark mad scientist lab interior features mixologists who concoct masterpieces like strawberry jalapeno tequila, bubblegum vodka or Earl Grey tea-infused gin with orange bitters and egg yolk. Gory zombie movies play on the TVs, guests sit in dark booths, and employees dressed like zombies hang around, adding to the creepy vibe. As owner Donny has told customers, ""Sorry, we're fresh out of brains. Can I get you a Bloody Mary? I'll put extra blood in it."" Conflict Kitchen, Pittsburgh . For a more high-minded, educational experience, try Pittsburgh's Conflict Kitchen. The restaurant's cuisine rotates every couple of months to serve foods from a hot spot with which the United States is in conflict. As the cuisine changes, so do the distinctive food wrappers. Each time a new location is featured, the food wrappers are printed with interviews with people from that place on topics like health care, the arts and the economy. Former versions of the restaurant have served Iranian, Cuban and North Korean foods. Currently, the Palestinian territories are being featured, and the menu boasts treats like maftoul (a garlicky chicken and couscous dish) and tamar Hindi (chilled tamarind juice with rose water). The Duce, Phoenix . This Prohibition-style 1928 warehouse has been converted into a boxing ring and yoga studio by day and part-restaurant, part-old-fashioned jazz club by night. Take a boxing class and then enjoy the all-day brunch menu before sidling up to the 1915 Chicago drug store soda fountain for a creamy dessert. Everything is made from scratch in ""Duchess,"" the 1965 Airstream trailer. Choose from menu items including gooey macaroni and cheese muffins, baked cinnamon pecan French toast or Pabst marinated chicken sausage sliders. Or just order them all. We won't judge. An hour of kickboxing surely warrants eating all of the cheese and ice cream you could ever want. The Exchange Bar and Grill, New York . This is one of the few restaurants where the price of your drink changes from day to day ... and you control it! At the Exchange Bar and Grill, the prices of alcoholic beverages fluctuate in 25-cent increments with supply and demand. There's a real-time stock market style ticker above the bar so you can keep track of price changes. The fewer customers who order a specific drink, the lower the price drops. While the fully stocked bar is the main attraction, popular foods like fried Oreos and waffle fry nachos leave customers raving.","Watch out for sneaky ninjas at a New York restaurant .

"South African wines have long been appreciated by even the snobbiest of sommeliers, and now harder drinks from the country are also making a name for themselves. Spirits from South Africa are winning awards around the world, and a little more than an hour from Cape Town, lies a region -- rich in herbs and grain -- that could explain the secret to that success. ""The Western Cape I think is the ideal place to make spirits,"" says Jeff Green, the process manager at the James Sedgewick Distillery, known for its Bain's Cape Mountain Whisky -- the country's first single grain whisky. ""We make whisky the same way as Scotland,"" explains Green, ""but that is not necessarily the same throughout the world. You can get so many different flavors and styles."" Supplementary spirits . And whisky isn't the only alcoholic fruit from this region. Even within the Western Cape there's a variety of tastes from the grapes and the way they are distilled. Paarl is one area that has grown grapes for centuries, and is the home of prolific brandy makers KWV. ""We've got the 12-year old, it's one of my favorites,"" explains Peadar Hegarty, marketing manager at KWV. ""You look at the color, it's nice and amber, it's got that nice glow to it."" Bitter brandy . Though brandy-making has been a main endeavor, the company is branching out. ""Brandy in South Africa actually carries a bit of stigma,"" Hegarty explains.  He says that at its peak South Africa produced 55 million liters, but that has now declined to less than 30 million liters. ""That volume has practically gone almost completely into whisky,"" says Hegarty. This shift is partly due to aspects of the drink that can't be tasted. Hegarty says South African consumers are looking for the image associated with high quality -- and they are willing to pay for that. When brandy failed to take off with these drinkers, the company turned to cognac -- a bold move considering the drink can only come from France. ""Really, the only difference between cognac and brandy is the region it comes from,"" says Hegarty. ""To be called a cognac, your grapes have to be picked in Cognac, in the western region of France, and you've got to bottle and mature in Cognac. So what we did is we formed a unique partnership with a cognac house and now we're the first South African company to brand and then sell Cognac."" But in bringing the South African touch to Cognac, KWV isn't just trying to offer new bottles and tastes. The company's CEO, Andre van der Veen, is focused on broadening their consumer base. ""You can start with a three-year old KWV brandy, but you can drink all the way up to a 30-year-old and then we got a cognac,"" Van der Veen explains. ""We want to give people an experience for any drinking occasion,"" he continues. ""[It is] not for every pocket, but for every occasion there should be a product which you could enjoy."" Wide whisky world . Bringing the celebrated French drink to South Africa may be one way for a South African brand to grow its market share, but some South African whisky makers are looking to other markets for growth. ""We are slowly exporting,"" explains Green from James Sedgewick Distillery. ""In Africa, it's quite exciting for us, we see Bain's [whisky] having a huge potential there, and we also are releasing small volumes in Canada and the UK."" And there is some evidence forays into foreign territories could prove successful. The South African ""Three Ships"" bourbon was awarded a gold medal at this year's China Wine and Spirits competition, the first South African whisky to do so. But if brands like these want to make a dent in the wider African market, they are going up against big competition. According to the Scotch Whisky Association, exports of Scotch to Nigeria increased by 34% to £6.6 million ($10.3 million) in the first half of this year. But this isn't the only African country enjoying a sip of the golden nectar. Exports to Kenya in the same period jumped by 89% to £253,386 and the Senegalese market grew 68% to £326,386. In fact, Daniel Mettyear, market analyst at International Wine & Spirit Research, describes the South African whisky market as ""miniscule"" in the global picture, making up just 0.21% of global exports in 2013. ""While South African whisky has been growing in recent years it has almost exclusively been taking place in South Africa,"" he explains. ""Producers like Distell are beginning to export to the rest of sub-Saharan Africa and this may be the one region where South African whisky can enjoy some success. However ... this will be limited by competition from Scotch, U.S. and Irish Whiskey at the top and cheap but hugely successful Indian Whiskies at the bottom."" Small scale production . Yet, such questions of worldwide expansion are less of a worry for some of South Africa's enthusiastic independent producers chasing that perfect blend rather than bumper profits. Part botanist, part foodie, Rodger Jorgensen makes gin, absinthe, vodka and more on the fringes of the Haweqwa Nature Reserve. ""We are blessed with a wonderful climate ample water here in the Western Cape so it's like a growth paradise,"" Jorgensen explains. ""What we try to do is to allow our products that come through our hand on process, to actually express that and we want to represent where we live...people are drawn to that and we try and keep our offering as fresh and as varied as we possibly can. And that in itself is a joy.""

"A damning new video shown Wednesday at the trial of Francesco Schettino, captain of the wrecked Costa Concordia cruise liner, appears to show him boarding a lifeboat with passengers still clearly on board the doomed ship. It was presented to the court as Schettino took the stand for a second day. Schettino's lawyer, Domenico Pepe, asked the court not to admit the fuzzy videotape that appeared to show the captain getting onto a lifeboat from the ship's bow wearing the same jacket and tie he had on at dinner before the ship crashed. But the judge ruled that Schettino could be questioned about it. The captain has previously said he was thrown off the cruise liner into a lifeboat as the ship listed sharply. Morning testimony focused on the chain of command aboard the doomed cruise liner, with Schettino admitting to the court that his aim in sailing close to Giglio -- leading the ship to hit rocks -- was to ""impress the passengers."" Earlier, he had denied that the ill-fated maneuver was to impress Moldovan dancer Domnica Cemortan. 'I didn't want to cause a panic' On Tuesday, he blamed others for failures that led to the crash and 32 deaths, but on Wednesday, he said the ship was his responsibility alone. ""As commander, I was second only to God,"" he told the court. Schettino was pressed about why he waited more than an hour to give the order to abandon the ship, even though it was clearly an emergency situation with the engine rooms flooded and the ship listing. He told the court, ""I wanted to calm the passengers, I didn't want to cause a panic and have people start jumping into the water."" When pressed further, he said, ""I waited to give the general emergency because I knew exactly how the ship would drift. I  know the Concordia well. I wanted to make sure that the ship was closer to the island and then give the general emergency. The damage was already done."" Referring to his crew, he said, ""I had 600 people who had never done a similar exercise with a ship in this position since the rules do not require it. ""And the words 'abandon ship' can be open to interpretation: Maybe people would jump into the sea. Instead, seeing that the ship was approaching the island anyway, I waited."" Captain confident about trial . Schettino -- who is charged with manslaughter, causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board -- denies wrongdoing. He faces up to 23 years in prison if convicted. On Tuesday, he was defiant and combative as he answered the prosecutor's questions in a makeshift courtroom in the Teatro Moderno in the Tuscan town of Grosseto. Speaking to CNN during a court break, he said he was ""confident"" about the way the trial was going. ""It is exhausting, but I think it is going well,"" Schettino said. ""It is important because this is the only chance I have to tell my version of events."" The cruise liner capsized after it struck rocks off Italy's Giglio Island in the Tyrrhenian Sea on January 12, 2012. No one died on impact, but 32 lives were lost during the subsequent chaotic evacuation of about 4,200 people aboard the ship.","Video appears to show Francesco Schettino climbing into a lifeboat from the ship .

"Michael Brown's stepfather says he's sorry for his emotional outburst to demonstrators after learning Officer Darren Wilson wouldn't be indicted in the teen's death. But he says he's unfairly taking heat for the rioting that followed. Despite Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson's assertion that police are investigating whether Louis Head intended to incite a riot with his words, law enforcement sources told CNN that Head is unlikely to be prosecuted. Head said Wednesday that ""emotions got the best of me"" on the night of November 24 in Ferguson, Missouri, when he yelled ""Burn this motherf---er down!"" and ""Burn this bitch down!"" ""I was so angry and full of raw emotions, as so many others were, and granted, I screamed out words that I shouldn't have screamed in the heat of the moment,"" he said in a statement obtained exclusively by CNN's Don Lemon. ""It was wrong, and I humbly apologize to all of those who read my pain and anger as a true desire for what I want for our community. ""But to place blame solely on me for the conditions of our community, and country, after the grand jury decision, goes way too far and is as wrong as the decision itself. To declare a state of emergency and send a message of war, and not peace, before a grand jury decision was announced is also wrong. ""In the end, I've lived in this community for a long time. The last thing I truly wanted was to see it go up in flames. In spite of my frustration, it really hurt to see that."" No charges likely . Don't expect any charges to come from the Ferguson and St. Louis County Police investigation into Head's comments, local law enforcement officials tell CNN. The officials say the investigation isn't likely to go anywhere, in part because it would face a high bar to prove that Head's words actually caused any rioters to act. One law enforcement official was frustrated by Jackson's comments, which officials view as inflammatory at a time when they're trying to calm the situation. ""We just wish he would just shut up,"" the law enforcement official said. Even if the investigation into Head's comments doesn't result in charges, the police investigation could still cause problems for him. Federal court records indicate he is on probation for a previous drug charge. CNN reached out to his probation officer, but there was no response to a request for comment. Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson . 'He just spoke out of anger' Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, was standing next to Head, her husband, when he made the comments.  She herself told the crowd that night that she'd never experienced anything like this, and offered some context in a CNN interview last week. After hearing the grand jury's decision, McSpadden said she felt like she'd been shot herself and her ""emotions were raging."" Head was angry, too, she said. ""He just spoke out of anger. It's one thing to speak, and it's a different thing to act. He did not act. He just spoke out of anger,"" she said. ""When you're that hurt and the system has did you this wrong, you may say some things as well. We've all spoke out of anger before."" Asked if her husband could be responsible for the fires and rioting, she replied, ""That's impossible. ...These things have been going on since August 9, when it first happened."" Charles Barkley: We never talk about race until something bad happens . 'Cause and effect ... hard to prove' CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes told CNN on Tuesday that he thought a prosecution was unlikely. ""I think they'll have a hard time proving that somebody that heard him in the midst of all that noise actually went over and did an arson or committed an act of starting a fire. I think most of the people you see in the crowd are not watching CNN. They're not watching media reporting of him saying that,"" he said. Also, Fuentes said, it's likely many people who had gathered in Ferguson as the grand jury's decision was announced were already determined to act. ""I think the cause and effect of his words will be hard to prove,"" Fuentes said. Protests nationwide . Brown's August shooting death -- and last week's grand jury decision not to indict the officer who killed him -- have sparked numerous protests in Ferguson and across the country. Demonstrations heated up again on Wednesday after a grand jury in New York decided not to indict a police officer in the choking death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man suspected of selling cigarettes illegally. Four members of the Denver Police Department's bicycle unit were injured after they were struck by a car while doing crowd control as a large group of high school students protested the Ferguson grand jury's decision, CNN affiliate KUSA reported. One of the officers is in critical condition undergoing surgery, police said. This week Attorney General Eric Holder visited Atlanta in what he said would be a series of nationwide conversations after the upheaval in Ferguson. ""This presents this nation with, I think, a unique opportunity,"" Holder said. ""And I think it's incumbent on all of us to seize this opportunity to deal with issues that for too long have been ignored.""

"St. Louis Rams players who showed support for Michael Brown's family should be praised, an organization representing black police officers in St. Louis says. ""We think that their actions were commendable and that they should not be ridiculed, disciplined or punished for taking a stand on this very important issue which is of great concern around the world and especially in the community where these players work,"" the Ethical Society of Police of St. Louis said in a statement this week. The group has about 220 members from the city's police force in its ranks, the society's general counsel, Gloria McCollum, told CNN Wednesday. It describes itself as ""the primary voice of African-American police officers in St. Louis city."" Earlier this week the St. Louis Police Officers Association said it was ""tasteless, offensive and inflammatory"" when five Rams players who walked onto the field Sunday displaying the ""hands up, don't shoot"" gesture adopted by protesters. The association's business manager, Jeff Roorda, demanded that the players be punished and that the team issue a ""very public apology."" ""I'd remind the NFL and their players that it is not the violent thugs burning down buildings that buy their advertiser's products,"" Roorda's statement said. ""It's cops and the good people of St. Louis and other NFL towns that do. Somebody needs to throw a flag on this play. If it's not the NFL and the Rams, then it'll be cops and their supporters."" But that doesn't represent the views of most black officers in the city, the Ethical Society of Police said. The St. Louis Police Officers Association has no black officers on its governing board and ""a minimal amount of African-American members,"" the Ethical Society of Police said. The St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department has nearly 2,000 employees, according to its website. About 30% of the department's commissioned officers are African-American, the society says. The Ethical Society of Police's statement said it ""completely supports the actions of the St. Louis Rams football players in which they showed support for the family of Michael Brown by entering the stadium with their hands up."" A representative from the St. Louis Police Officers Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Rams declined to discipline the players or issue an apology, but the team sent a representative to speak with police. On Monday, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar claimed he had received an apology. The team denied it ever said sorry. The players said they weren't trying to stir up trouble so much as show their support for the suburb just north of the city where they play. That doesn't sit well with the St. Louis Police Officers Association, which still wants its apology. Cedric Alexander, president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, said his organization isn't taking a side on the matter. ""The bigger issue is healing as a community and nation and moving forward,"" he said. Alexander, who's also police chief in DeKalb County, Georgia, said he hopes the Rams and the St. Louis police associations ""can all get together to promote a sense of community that will be a role model for what we need to do together going forward in St. Louis, across the country and around the world.""

"(CNN) -- When Typhoon Haiyan made landfall in the Philippines on November 8, 2013, it struck the city of Tacloban hard. The capital city of Leyte province, nearly 400 miles south-east of Manila, was one of the first places hit by the storm and was devastated by a huge ""storm surge"" fueled by winds that reached an average of 195 mph (310 kmph). Around 200,000 people were made homeless in a matter of hours as a wall of ocean water flattened their homes. Tacloban City Stadium was one of just a handful of structures in the area to withstand the storm, despite its coastal location.

"When Lady Gaga speaks of young women being abused in the music industry, she speaks from experience. During an interview with Howard Stern on his radio show Tuesday, the singer recalled being sexually harassed and assaulted when she was coming up in the music industry. Gaga said that most of the men she's worked with in the studio had been inappropriate at one time or another, barring exceptions like producer RedOne, who worked with Gaga on her debut album ""The Fame,"" and singer Tony Bennett, with whom she's collaborated. ""That's why that album was successful, because I was able to write some music that wasn't made while I had the fear of God in me, pulling my skirt down in a studio because men were shoving their hands up my dress,"" Gaga told Stern. It's ""still bad now. Not just for me. Think about all those young girls that are 16 in New York, (or) 19, going, 'I met this record producer and he's going to make me a star, he said he worked with Beyonce.' ... It's all a big lie."" When Stern pointedly asked Gaga if she was raped by a record producer, the singer replied that she's gone through ""some horrific things."" ""I'm able to laugh now, because I've gone through a lot of mental and physical therapy to heal over the years,"" Gaga said. ""My music's been wonderful for me. But I was a shell of my former self at one point. I was not myself. To be fair, I was about 19, so ... I went to Catholic school and all this crazy stuff happened, and I was going, 'Oh, is this just the way adults are?' I was very naive."" Lady Gaga spews forth: This is no act . Afterward, it took the singer years to acknowledge what happened. ""It didn't affect me as much right after as it did about four or five years later. It hit me so hard. I was so traumatized by it, I was like: 'Just keep going,' "" she said. ""I wasn't even willing to admit that anything had even happened. ... I didn't tell anybody. I didn't even tell myself for the longest time. And then I was like, you know what, all this drinking, and all this nonsense, you have to go to the source, otherwise it just won't go away."" Gaga's admission came about after Stern brought up her performance of her song ""Swine"" at the South by Southwest festival earlier this year. That performance, which included Gaga being vomited on by artist Millie Brown, was raked over the coals. Some just didn't like it, but others accused Gaga of promoting eating disorders. In actuality, that performance was an attempt to air out some long-held anger and pain, Gaga said. The song ""Swine"" ""is about rape,"" she said. ""The song is about demoralization. The song is about rage and fury and passion, and I had a lot of pain that I wanted to release. And I said to myself, 'I want to sing this song while I'm ripping hard on a drumkit, and then I want to get on a mechanical bull -- which is probably one of the most demoralizing things you can put a female on in her underwear -- and I want this chick to throw up on me in front of the world, so that I can tell them, you know what?

"Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said a power outage put city schools, firehouses, police stations, City Hall and Wayne State University in the dark Tuesday morning. Speaking at a press conference, Duggan said power had been restored to about one third of the customers by 2 p.m. ET and that power probably will be restored to all by the end of the day. The outage affected about 900 locations, including 36 fire stations and 81 city schools, according to the Detroit website. Public schools dismissed students after the power went out. Duggan said the dismissal went smoothly. The mayor said there had been no spike in police or fire calls while power was out. About 18 state troopers helped 78 officers direct traffic at intersections while traffic signals were out of service, he said. Schools and other public buildings should be back in service Wednesday, officials said. The city website said 740 traffic signals were knocked out, but power was not lost for the 911 system. The outage occurred about 10:40 a.m. ET when a Public Lighting Department (PLD) power cable and then a circuit breaker failed, he said. The City of Detroit is going through bankruptcy. As part of the process, the city is getting out of the business of running PLD and the utility corporation DTE Energy is taking over, Duggan said. DTE Energy assisted the city in bringing the system back online. ""All we know at this point is that the cable went to ground, which means it grounded itself out,"" said Jerry Norcia, president and chief operating officer for DTE Electric and Gas Storage & Pipelines. ""So it could be a breach in the insulation or it could be many other circumstances that caused that cable to fail."" Detroit has experienced notable power outages in the past. Just last Sunday, power went out during a professional hockey game at Joe Louis Arena. Detroit's Comerica Park lost power last year during the American League Championship Series. The outage trapped some people in elevators in several government buildings, and firefighters were trying to free them, fire Chief Dale Bradley said. This outage isn't believed to have affected residences, officials said. Duggan said he'd earlier asked DTE to focus on those circuits that fail the most and review them. The cable that failed Tuesday was not one that had done so previously, authorities said. The power outage won't affect Tuesday night's professional hockey game, said Todd Beam, Red Wings director of public relations. ""We are back at full power at Joe Louis Arena,"" he said. ""The game will be played as scheduled at 7:30 p.m. tonight.""","Detroit mayor says he hopes power will be restored by end of day .

"(CNN) -- The controversy over having TV host Bill Maher speak at the University of California Berkeley has taken another turn. Well, make that two. If you remember, the outspoken comedian was selected as the school's 2014 fall commencement speaker, until students incensed by his anti-religious comments -- particularly his views on Islam -- started a petition to have him removed. On Tuesday night, the student group that's tasked with selecting commencement speakers met and voted to withdraw Maher's invitation. That would have been the end of the matter except the very next day, the college said it won't honor the vote. ""This university has not in the past and will not in the future shy away from hosting speakers who some deem provocative,"" the school said. The disinvitation . The student group is called The Californians. It's a committee of undergrads whose role is to come up with graduation speakers. In August, the Californians selected Maher. On Tuesday, it decided to unselect him. But the college says the Tuesday night meeting was held without administration participation. ""The UC Berkeley administration cannot and will not accept this decision, which appears to have been based solely on Mr. Maher's opinions and beliefs, which he conveyed through constitutionally protected speech,"" the school said in a statement. It added that the school's decision shouldn't be taken as an endorsement of Maher's views. ""Indeed, the administration's position on Mr. Maher's opinions and perspectives is irrelevant in this context."" As so, it said, the invitation stands; Maher will speak at the December event. The reaction . The Council on American-Islamic Relations expressed disappointment at the college's ruling, saying it disrespected students ""by casting aside the long-standing process for selecting commencement speakers and instead imposing its own will. ""While Mr. Maher has the right to speak whenever and wherever he likes, he does not have the right to have his hate-filled views honored and tacitly endorsed by a prestigious university,"" said Zahra Billoo, of the group's San Francisco chapter. For his part, Maher's keeping mum. ""Every news outlet asking me 4 comment on this Berkeley thing but then i remembered: I'VE got a show!And thats where I'll address it,Fri nite,"" he tweeted. The controversy . Meanwhile, the petition on Change.org that started the back-and-forth continues to draws signatures. By early Wednesday morning, 4,100 had signed on. ""Bill Maher is a blatant bigot and racist who has no respect for the values UC Berkeley students and administration stand for,"" the petition says. ""In a time where climate is a priority for all on campus, we cannot invite an individual who himself perpetuates a dangerous learning environment."" The petition points to recent episodes of Maher's HBO show ""Real Time"" as an example. (HBO, like CNN, is a division of Time Warner.) ""Islam is the only religion that acts like the mafia that will f***ing kill you if you say the wrong thing,"" Maher said during one episode, which is cited on the students' petition as an example of Maher's ""hate speech."" This isn't the only petition on the site about Maher. Several have called for his firing from ""Real Time,"" though they don't seem to have garnered much traction. Maher has been on the show for 12 years and has become known for his controversial statements on a wide range of topics. One of Maher's favorite targets is organized religion. His 2008 documentary ""Religulous"" grossed more than $13 million, according to Box Office Mojo.","A student group selected Maher as speaker in August .

"A new study of over a million women reports smokers more than triple their risk of dying early compared with nonsmokers, and that kicking the habit can virtually eliminate this increased risk of premature death. Smoking remains the leading causes of preventable death in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Lead study author Richard Peto, a professor at the University of Oxford in the U.K., and his colleagues conducted one of the largest studies looking at the hazards of smoking and the benefits of quitting among women born around the 1940s. These women were among the first generation of females to smoke regularly throughout their lifetimes, and tracking these women into the 21st century provided the most comprehensive look at the prolonged effects of smoking, as well as the benefits of quitting. TIME.com: Largest ever survey on global tobacco use issues dire warnings . ""Only in the 21st century could we observe directly the full effects of prolonged smoking, and of prolonged cessation, on premature mortality among women,"" said Peto in a statement. Between 1996 and 2001, the researchers recruited 1.3 million female participants ages 50 to 65. The women filled out questionnaires detailing their lifestyles, medical status and sociodemographic factors. The researchers followed up and resurveyed the women three and eight years later. At the start of the study, published in the journal Lancet, 20% of the women were smokers, 28% were former smokers and 52% never smoked. Each of the women was registered in the U.K.'s national health system, so their deaths and cause of death were recorded. By 2011, 66,000 had passed away. The researchers found that women who smoked cigarettes throughout their adult years had three times a greater risk of dying compared with nonsmokers and women who quit well before middle age. They were much more likely to die of smoking-related causes like lung cancer, heart disease and stroke. Even light smokers who smoked one to nine cigarettes per day had two times the mortality rate of nonsmokers. TIME.com: 5 smartphone apps that promote smoking . More encouraging, however, was the positive effect that quitting seemed to have on the women's life span. Those who quit smoking before they reached 40 avoided more than 90% of the increased risk of premature death from cigarettes, while women who stopped even earlier -- before age 30 -- avoided 97% of the added risk. And it's never too late, the authors write, to stub out those cigarettes. ""Even cessation at about 50 years of age avoids at least two-thirds of the continuing smoker's excess mortality in later middle age,"" they write. The hazards of smoking on health and mortality for women who continued to smoke past 40, for example, were 10 times greater than among women who quit before age 40. Rachel Huxley, a professor at the University of Minnesota who wrote an accompanying editorial to the study, says that the latest data on women are a welcome addition to existing knowledge, which have underestimated the full impact of smoking on women. ""Unlike in men, we have had to wait until now to fully understand the hazards of smoking and the associated benefits of quitting in women,"" she says. ""This is because smoking only first became popular among women born in the 1960s -- decades later than men -- and because of the long time lag between smoking and disease onset, we've had to wait until these women were in their 50s to really see the damage to health that smoking has."" TIME.com: The major toll of secondhand smoke . Huxley and the study authors note that compared with those who don't smoke, women who smoke are at greater risk of heart disease than male smokers. Although the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown, researchers speculate that smoking's effect on dampening the potentially protective effects of estrogen on the heart might put women smokers at a higher risk for heart disease than men who light up. Behavioral factors, like the fact that women tend to inhale more deeply than men, may also play a role. ""We just don't know, but it's intriguing and warrants further study,"" says Huxley. Although smoking rates have largely declined in the West since the 1940s, new evidence suggests the practice may be on the rise in developing countries. In August, the World Health Organization released a report showing global smoking rates remain strong, with 1 in 10 women picking up the habit. More people from middle-income countries are smoking, and women are starting at younger ages. Given these trends, data on the long-term health effects of smoking are desperately needed, says Huxley.

"(CNN) -- Shameless. There's no other word to describe Monica Lewinsky. Sixteen years after her affair with President Bill Clinton became public knowledge, she's returned to the limelight with a campaign against cyberbullying -- of which she claims to have been ""patient zero."" Ignore the fact that she was patently not the primary victim in the Zippergate affair (poor Hillary Clinton was) or that any comparison with someone suffering a disease, especially at a time when people are dropping dead from Ebola, is tasteless in the extreme. What's most depressing is that when she rejoined the public stage, she said she was inspired to speak out by the story of Tyler Clementi, a student who committed suicide after a video of him kissing another boy went up online. Young Clementi was the victim of societal homophobia as well as an invasion of his privacy, and his death makes any comparison with Lewinsky's self-imposed troubles ridiculous. Moreover, Clementi died in 2010. Lewinsky has decided to revisit his cause in 2014, suggesting that the timing may have less to do with him than it does with Hillary Clinton. And, of course, this will be embarrassing for Hillary Clinton. Lewinsky has joined Twitter, which will allow her to make uncensored remarks in the course of the 2016 campaign. And Lewinsky has also lashed out at the way the White House machine trashed her in its desire to protect Bill Clinton's reputation (as it was paid to do -- she had an affair with the President of the United States, not an anonymous bank manager no one gave a damn about). Another view: Stop judging Monica Lewinsky . All of which will give ammunition to Hillary Clinton's critics on both the right and left. The right won't have to waste its own resources reminding people of the seedier side of the Clinton years -- Lewinsky can do that now. And Democratic opponents to the left of Hillary Clinton will rejoice that someone is perpetuating the narrative that the Clintons are gangsters who toy with the lives of others. Lewinsky's new cyberbullying angle is inspired: A significant number of Hollywood liberals must live in terror of unflattering/undressed photos of them getting out online. But while Lewinsky grabs some TV time talking about her own liberties, she forgets those of her fellow sisters -- the mistreated wives. Imagine that your husband was caught cheating and the contents of your marriage were discussed every night on television. Would you feel happy about his mistress reappearing 16 years later to drag the whole thing up again, and even to play the victim? Does Hillary Clinton not have a right to put this scandal behind her and have a political identity separate from her husband's? Lewinsky says that she wants to take on the ""shame game."" But what she did all those years ago and what she's doing now makes her a perfect candidate for a good, old-fashioned shaming.","Timothy Stanley: Monica Lewinsky's return to public stage is shameless in several ways .
She's not the victim, and it's tasteless to call herself ""patient zero"" of online bullying, he says .
He says she downplays own guilt in affair, humiliates Hillary Clinton once again .

"Situated at the heart of Southeast Asia, Singapore is one of the most densely populated countries on the planet. More than 5 million people are crammed into this bustling city-state with an area of just 276 square miles. The squeeze is so tight there's little room left to take advantage of the surrounding natural beauty. But one developer wants to tap into the tourism market by singling out the nearby Riau Archipelago to host ""Funtasy Island,"" the world's largest eco-resort. The $240 million development, currently in construction, will stretch out over a cluster of six islands covering almost 3.3 million square meters (35 million square feet). While the archipelago lies just 16 kilometers (9 miles) off the coast of Singapore, the area is actually part of and administered by neighboring Indonesia. Crystal clear water, coral reefs and thousands of mangrove trees provide the stunning backdrop to marinas, villas, luxury bungalows and hotel accommodation. It's already an impressive site but the ""property is just a start,"" said Funtasy Island Pte Director, Michael Yong. Eco-tourism . Roughly 70% of the islands will be preserved in their natural state -- part of the developer's commitment to creating a viable eco-park. ""Without that 70% of the natural attractions, our island development will be just like any other or another real estate development,"" Yong continued. Nature trails and aquaculture tours will allow visitors to enjoy Riau's natural beauty while the short boat ride to Singapore keeps popular attractions like Universal Studios and Marina Bay Sands close. But being green also means development plans have had to be stringently checked and monitored. Caps have been set on future visitors, buildings have been relocated from where they were originally slated for and the overall number of units has been paired back. According to Syarief Santoso, director of WOW Design Studio, such amendments were necessary to maintain authenticity. ""It has to feel like we are blend with the nature,"" Santoso said. ""We don't want to change that, we want to blend into this environment and make everything balanced, everything synchronized."" Foreign ownership . The average cost per square meter of property comes in at about $5,000. If that sounds like a deal for an over-the-water villa a short stroll from a powdery white beach, there's a reason. In line with Indonesian property law, foreign investors can't buy their piece of paradise here, only lease it for set terms. ""We are actually selling the lease of the building,"" Yong explained. ""Every 25 years we do an extension for 20 years, every 20 years we do another renewal."" The developers say many investors are undeterred. More than 500 homes have sold to date, mostly to buyers from Singapore, Malaysia and China . In total over 1,200 holiday villas and apartments will be needed to house the one million tourists expected each year. With Funtasy Island set to welcome its first guests in late 2015, there's not long left to ensure everything is in place to meet that target.","Funtasy Island is set to be the world's largest eco-resort .

"A remote island with stunning underground architecture. A massive crypt lined with copper bars, a colossal sphere at its center. Mazes made of stone that lead from one underground chamber to another, each differing in shape and size. I didn't expect my visit to the Japanese ""art island"" of Naoshima to remind me of the world of Myst, the computer game I played as a child. It's been more than a decade since I played the game, but that strange, beautifully desolate island and the eerie feeling of wandering around it alone have stayed with me. Exploring Naoshima's underground galleries, I was reminded again and again of Myst's mysterious mechanical structures, right down to the discovery of ""puzzles"" that visitors are meant to figure out on their own. Magnificent architecture . Some 3,000 islands dot the Seto Inland Sea of Japan, which separates Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu, three of the four main islands of Japan. While many of those islands remain quiet and uninhabited, Naoshima has been turned into one of the most remarkable art and architecture destinations in the world. Visitors often refer to it as ""Ando Island,"" since most of the structures on the island were designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Tadao Ando. A museum designed by and dedicated to the renowned architect is also located on the island. Naoshima's transformation into a unique art project began in 1987, when Soichiro Fukutake, the chairman of Fukutake Publishing, now known as the Benesse Holdings, Inc., purchased the south side of the island. Enlisted by Fukutake to supervise development on the southern portion of the island, Ando went to work over the next two decades designing a hotel complex and museums. Adhering to his guiding principle of designing buildings that follow the natural forms of landscapes, Ando's buildings on the island blend into or are built into the earth, some of them opening up to the sky. 'Perfect balance of light, sound, space, color' Some of Ando's buildings became part of the Benesse Art Site Naoshima (BASN), which showcases major artworks acquired by the company over the past decades. Since 1995, many of those pieces have been created specifically for the island. That same year, the company established the Benesse Prize at the Venice Biennale, commissioning winners to create works specifically for BASN, which includes Naoshima and the nearby islands of Teshima and Inujima. Just as the art has been designed for the island, the buildings that house the works have been designed to maximize the impact of the art. Opened in 2004, the island's Chichu Art Museum showcases its collection in spectacular and unexpected ways. In the museum's Claude Monet Space, a vast, pure white underground chamber is made up of hundreds of thousands of tiny stone tiles. The dazzling while tiles perfectly show off the enormous blue and violet paintings on each wall. Visitors remove their shoes at the entrance and are given soft slippers. When I visited, I was the only person in the room (not counting an attendant who stood in a corner as still as a sculpture). The space gleams white from the natural light peering through a white stone ceiling. It was the same everywhere I went on the island -- quiet, stupefying displays of beauty and art with breathtaking sea or landscapes in the background. Visitor numbers are restricted throughout the exhibitions. ""They've managed to create a perfect balance of light, sound, space, color and proportion, which makes the experience transcendent and unforgettable,"" says Rhea Karam, a New York-based fine arts photographer at work on a project inspired by Naoshima. The same as I did, Karam found the Claude Monet Space a shock. ""Growing up in Paris, I was very familiar with Monet's work and accustomed to seeing it everywhere to the point that I wasn't particularly interested when I heard he was displayed in the Chichu Art Museum,"" says Karam. ""The unbelievable, almost holistic presentation of Monet's Water Lily paintings made me see them in a light I had never before experienced."" Where to stay, what to see . Limited accommodation on the island mean the number of visitors is limited. While small inns have been cropping up on the island, a stay at the hotel Benesse House remains by far the best way to get the full Naoshima experience. Comprised of four different lodgings (Museum, Oval, Park, Beach), the hotel's rooms all provide incredible views of the Seto Inland Sea and have beautiful art of their own. It's a bit like staying at a modern art gallery. The standout is the breathtaking Oval (see gallery above), with its six rooms built around an oval pond. Oval is connected to the Benesse House Museum by a monorail accessible only to Oval guests. Benesse operates a free shuttle bus from Benesse House Museum to nearby Lee Ufan Museum and Chichu Art Museum. The shuttle also runs to the more removed Honmura District, once a castle town, on the island's east side, where the Ando Museum and the Art House Project are located. The former is a small museum designed by Tadao Ando featuring his architecture; the latter is a project that turns empty houses into works of art. Visitors to the Honmura side can pick up a map from the Honmura Lounge, a visitor's center and gift shop, and take part in a treasure hunt around the old castle town to find the art projects hidden in century-old houses. The nearby islands of Inujima and Teshima house continuations of the remarkable Benesse Art Site Naoshima project. Naoshima is reached by ferry from the ports of Uno (near Okayama) and Takamatsu.

"It's the biggest countdown for NASA since the shuttle era ended in 2011. The space agency's new Orion spacecraft is scheduled to lift off on an uncrewed test flight at 7:05 a.m. ET Thursday from Space Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. ""We haven't had this feeling in awhile, since the end of the shuttle program,"" Mike Sarafin, Orion flight director at Johnson Space Center, said in a preflight briefing on Wednesday. He said it's the beginning of something new: exploring deep space. Orion looks like a throwback to the Apollo era, but it is roomier and designed to go far beyond the moon: to an asteroid and eventually to Mars. ""It is, I think, consistent with those -- the beginning of shuttle and beginning of Apollo,"" said Mark Geyer, NASA Orion program manager. ""I think it's in the same category."" When it becomes fully operational, Orion's crew module will be able to carry four people on a 21-day mission into deep space or six astronauts for shorter missions. By comparison, the Apollo crew modules held three astronauts and were in space for six to 12 days. Orion's crew module is 16.5 feet in diameter and Apollo was 12.8 feet in diameter, NASA said. Orion is expected to take up its first crew in 2021. During this test flight, Orion will climb to an altitude of 3,600 miles (15 times higher than the International Space Station) and will orbit Earth twice. Four and half hours later, it will splash down in the Pacific Ocean about 600 miles off the coast of Baja California. Two U.S. Navy ships, the amphibious transport dock ship USS Anchorage and the Military Sealift Command rescue and salvage ship USNS Salvor, will help NASA recover the capsule. NASA said there haven't been any major issues with the countdown. The vehicle is ""extremely clean"" and ""we're ready to go,"" said Geyer. The weather forecast for liftoff also is good, with a 70% chance of acceptable launch conditions, according to  Kathy Winters, a U.S. Air Force weather officer. ""It looks pretty promising weather-wise for launch,"" she said. Charles Bolden Op Ed: NASA's Mars milestone . Winters said there may be some scattered clouds, but because the launch window will be open for two hours and 39 minutes, mission managers have some wiggle room if rain moves in. The temperature at launch time should be around 72 degrees Fahrenheit. With mostly clear skies in the forecast, residents along Florida's east coast should be able to see the contrail from the huge Delta IV Heavy rocket that will carry Orion into orbit. The rocket is provided by United Launch Alliance, one of the private partners helping NASA with this launch.  Eventually, NASA will use its own Space Launch System, which is under construction. Once in orbit, Orion should send back some amazing pictures of Earth, NASA said. If the weather cooperates, NASA said a drone will provide a live video feed of the splashdown. Though Orion's first flight won't have people on it, it won't go up empty. It will carry the names of more than a million people packed on a dime-sized microchip. ""Sesame Street"" is sending up some mementos to inspire students about spaceflight, including Cookie Monster's cookie and Ernie's rubber ducky. Also going up: an oxygen hose from an Apollo 11 lunar spacesuit and a small sample of lunar soil. A Tyrannosaurus rex fossil from the Denver Science Museum will be on board and lockers will be filled with flags, coins, patches, poetry and music. In one more throwback to the Apollo-era, NASA veteran Gene Kranz will be a VIP in Mission Control at Johnson Space Center in Houston when Orion is launched. Kranz was flight director for Apollo 11 during the first landing on the moon and he was flight director for the return of the Apollo 13 crew. ""I look forward very much to having him watch the team in action,"" Serafin said.","New spaceship Orion is ""go"" for test flight .

"Egypt's high administrative court on Saturday upheld a controversial decision to dissolve parliament -- a move the nation's president emphatically opposes -- state news reported. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which ruled Egypt after the 2011 ouster of longtime President Hosni Mubarak, dissolved parliament in June 2012 in line with a ruling from the High Constitutional Court that declared the constitutional articles that regulated parliamentary elections were invalid. That soon set up a showdown with Mohamed Morsy, who was elected president later that month and whose former group, the Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party, had won more legislative seats than any other entity. Morsy opted to override the military by calling back parliament when he took office June 30, though weeks later he vowed to respect the court's ruling that parliament was still dissolved. Saturday's decision, by the high administrative court, once again upholds the decision on the so-called People's Assembly because the elections that spawned it, beginning in November 2011, were unconstitutional, the state-run Al-Ahram news website reported. Judges didn't entirely close the book on the case, though. Judges set aside a ruling on a similar case involving parliament, promising to rule on October 15. Even as things may change, the decision for now continues to leave Egypt without a democratically elected legislative body at a time it faces a host of issues, including major economic problems and social unrest. However, there's no longer a political crisis pitting against Morsy against the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which assumed legislative powers after it dissolved parliament. In August, Morsy shook up Egypt's powerful military leadership by replacing top generals and reasserting powers that the military claimed for itself before he took office. He also reversed the June constitutional decree by the Supreme Council that claimed to retain legislative authority until a new parliament could be sworn in near the end of the year, Ali said.","High Administrative Court says Egypt's parliament remains dissolved, as it ruled earlier .
But the court will rule October 15 on a similar case, leaving the door open for change .
Egypt's then-military rulers dissolved parliament after the court found vote unconstitutional .
President Morsy was critical and called parliament back, then said he'd respect court decision ."
"(CNN)  -- For video game junkies, blockbuster titles like Cold War-era shooter ""Call of Duty: Black Ops"" and post-apocalyptic role-player ""Fallout: New Vegas"" make 2010 a hard act to follow. But 2011 is shaping up to be a pretty good year for games, too. From jaw-dropping shooter ""Rage"" to animated fighting game ""Marvel vs. Capcom 3,"" there are many promising releases coming in the months ahead. Here's a look at some games to look forward to this year. The impending deluge begins this month -- traditionally a slow period for new releases -- with the combination platform-hopping, game-building ""LittleBigPlanet 2,"" which lets you create and share new levels or challenges. Also arriving in January is sci-fi horror epic ""Dead Space 2,"" which forces space cadets to survive a maze of high-tech corridors crawling with misshapen monsters. Hybrid puzzle and arcade game ""Lost in Shadow,"" wherein players manipulate illuminated objects to make shadows take on new angles and forms, will also make its debut. February will bring ""Portal 2,"" a puzzle game that demands you solve challenges by teleporting items and individuals between locations. Like ""Angry Birds,"" the game allows fans to casually experiment with physics. Over-the-top, first-person shooter ""Bulletstorm,"" a tongue-in-cheek, hyper-macho run-n-gun outing that offers numerous ways to creatively off opponents, will hit stores shortly thereafter. Also coming next month is ""Blade Runner"" homage ""Deus Ex: Human Revolution,"" which lets you solve a futuristic global conspiracy through stealth, combat, hacking or the use of mechanical limbs. Ditto for ""Killzone 3,"" a stunning sci-fi shooter game that promises to demonstrate how powerful the PlayStation 3 can be with its 3-D TV-ready effects and support for motion controls. Fast forward to March, and we get the long-awaited ""Mortal Kombat"" fighting game series reboot, as well as sci-fi run-n-gun extravaganza ""Crysis 2,"" which hopes to raise the bar for graphic fidelity. ""Dragon Age II,"" a sequel to the grim and gritty fantasy epic, will make a violent appearance as well. Massively multiplayer online sword and sorcery tale ""Final Fantasy XIV"" is expected to be released on PlayStation 3, joining its already-released PC cousin. Actual launch dates become murkier further out, but upcoming titles for the rest of the year appear no less intriguing. Fans of stealth action can look forward to ""Metal Gear Solid Rising"" and ""Batman: Arkham City,"" a sequel to the best-selling superhero action-adventure ""Batman: Arkham Asylum."" Those who prefer a good mystery have ""L.A. Noire."" Epic firefights abound in ""SOCOM 4: U.S. Navy SEALs,"" ""Duke Nukem Forever,"" and ""Gears of War 3."" Sports enthusiasts will enjoy completely new spins on familiar pastimes in ""Mario Sports Mix"" and ""NASCAR: The Game 2011."" There are even a few hidden treasures for the role-playing crowd in ""Hunted: Demon's Forge"" and ""Dungeon Siege III."" It all adds up to a potential banner year for console and PC game releases. You might consider putting some holiday money aside for later in 2011, when the real gifts arrive.","With such titles as ""Dead Space 2"" and a ""Mortal Kombat"" reboot, 2011 will be a good year .

"(CNN) -- Nichelle Nichols has spent her whole life going where no one has gone before, and at 81 she's still as sassy and straight-talking as you'd expect from an interstellar explorer. ""I don't have enough sense to keep my mouth shut,"" says the legendary Star Trek actor with a hearty laugh. ""Whatever comes up, comes out."" ""I can't help myself."" As the startlingly beautiful and fiercely intelligent Lt. Uhura on the hit 1960s TV series, Nichols was a revolutionary figure at a time when the only African-American women you saw on U.S. TV were usually playing servants. Indeed, Star Trek was reportedly the only program Martin Luther King Jr would let his children stay up late to watch. When Nichols was considering leaving the show to pursue a career on Broadway, King Jr personally implored her to stay, saying she was a powerful role model for black people across the country -- and the world. ""That was the greatest thing,"" says Nichols. ""That was greater than anything else, to be told that by Dr. Martin Lurther King, because he was my leader. ""So I stayed and I never regretted it."" NASA ambassador . As the original series drew to a close at the end of the decade, a real-life space race was gathering pace -- and this time it was Nichols calling for auditions. The United States landed a man on the moon in 1969 -- but our astronauts needn't be limited to white males, said Nichols. ""There were no women, and there were no minorities in the space program -- and that's supposed to represent the whole country?"" she says, her voice rising incredulously down the phone from her home in Woodland Hills, California. ""Not in this day and age. We just absolutely cannot have that. I can't be a part of that,"" she said at the time. The glamorous sci-fi celebrity was soon enlisted by NASA to recruit the country's first female and ethnic minority astronauts. She traveled the length and breadth of the United States calling for promising astronauts to come forward -- among them was Sally Ride, the first American woman in space, and Charles Bolden, the current NASA administrator. ""As a matter of fact, Sally called me to tell me that I was the way she had heard about the space program,"" says Nichols. ""I was somewhat of a celebrity in their eyes. I had gone on television and in several interviews spoke of why they should get involved, and they took it up and said 'she's absolutely right.'"" The kiss . Nichols wasn't just a TV celebrity -- she was a TV revolutionary, locking lips with William Shatner in one of the small screen's first interracial kisses, in 1968. Though at the time, she didn't quite see what all the fuss was about. ""I come from an interracial family, and so it was kind of boring for me to be talking about something I experienced every day,"" she says. ""It was not new to me, because I lived it. ""But I realized it was new on TV, and I had the opportunity to bring it to the world."" The scene -- in which Lt. Uhura and Captain Kirk are controlled by humanoids who force them to embrace -- received a huge response from the public, largely positive. Society today has much to learn from the crew living on board the ""Enterprise"" in the 23rd century, says Nichols. ""Star Trek is about the freedom to be who you are, and be respected for who you are,"" she says, her warm native Illinois accent raspy round the edges. ""It demands that you respect everyone else equally. It's as simple as that."" Stars in her eyes . Born in the small town of Robbins, outside Chicago, in 1932, Nichols came from a family that defied convention. Her grandfather was a white Southerner who married a black woman, and in doing so was ostracized by his wealthy parents. Nichols' father was a factory worker who also served as town mayor. A talented dancer and singer, Nichols started performing Chicago clubs at 14, meeting one jazz legend who would change her life forever -- Duke Ellington. ""He was the greatest name in music, black or white or any other thing,"" says Nichols. ""Everyone at every level had the greatest respect for him."" She later toured with the successful composer, despite other people's reservations about what was expected of schoolgirls at the time. ""You went to school and it was like 'girls didn't do that.' But I was like 'c'mon.' So I just jumped on this opportunity with both feet,"" she says. Enduring wonder of space . As a child, Nichols was also told that ""girls weren't supposed to like science"" -- not that she took much notice. ""Science is not a boy's game, it's not a girl's game. It's everyone's game. It's about where we are and where we're going,"" she says, and you can almost picture the serene figure of Lt. Uhura in red uniform, speaking at the controls. ""Space travel benefits us here on Earth. And we ain't stopped yet. There's more exploration to come."" It seems Star Trek's legendary communications officer has a real-life message for us all.

"A lot has changed since Skype made its debut 11 years ago. Younger users aren't satisfied with lengthy video calls on computers anymore. They want to communicate in small bites throughout the day, sending texts, selfies, gifs, emojis and ""Yo""s from mobile devices. To keep up with the times, Skype launched the ephemeral messaging app Qik on Tuesday. The free app sticks to Skype's video roots while borrowing heavily from the Snapchat playbook. The standalone app lets you send videos up to 42 seconds long to a single person or a group. They can then respond by recording another video clip or with a prerecorded five-second video. The clips in the resulting back-and-forth ""conversations"" can be replayed for up to two weeks, at which point they disappear.  Video clips can't be shared outside the app, and if someone deletes a video they sent, it will disappear from the recipient's app as well. To make it simple, the app, available for iOS, Android and Windows Phone, doesn't require users to sign in with any account. It just uses their phone number and then looks for contacts in their address book. Skype's video calls are still hugely popular, but mobile devices have upended how people communicate. More than half of Skype's new users every month sign up from smartphones and tablets, and during the day, there are times when more people are using Skype on a mobile device than on a desktop or laptop. The company, which was purchased by Microsoft in 2011, is competing against social networks and an assortment of messaging apps. They include Viber, WhatsApp, WeChat, Snapchat and Facebook Messenger, as well as traditional texts and instant message apps. ""There's a different social contract to how we communicate these days,"" said Dan Chastney, Qik's principal program manager. ""It's really changing behavior, where you're not worried if the person on the other end is available to talk to you."" Most recently, there's been a rise in ephemeral messaging, in which photos and words automatically delete after they're viewed. Snapchat may have popularized the trend, but the desire to have communications that aren't archived forever echoes the real world. ""I wouldn't want somebody recording every conversation I have in a bar,"" Chastney said. The company thinks that not saving everything will help some people loosen up and become more comfortable with asynchronous video conversations. ""We didn't want people worrying about having to look perfect on camera or that a message recorded might be taken out of context later,"" Chastney said. Apps that automatically delete messages can give a false sense of privacy. Skype is careful to avoid selling its new product as a security tool, like more security-minded competitors Wickr and Cryptocat. That might be a smart move after recent news that more than 100,000 Snapchat photos were intercepted and leaked. Qik's creators say it isn't meant as a high-security method for holding important conversations. ""The goal of the app wasn't to have this super-private, super-secure communication,"" Chastney said. ""It's for having casual conversations.""","Qik is a new messaging app from Skype that lets people communicate with video clips .
Like Snapchat, the clips eventually delete, so there's no archive of conversations .
This is Skype's first standalone spinoff app ."
"Twitter is suing the U.S. government in an effort to loosen restrictions on what the social media giant can say publicly about the national security-related requests it receives for user data. The company filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department on Monday in a federal court in northern California, arguing that its First Amendment rights are being violated by restrictions that forbid the disclosure of how many national security letters and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court orders it receives -- even if that number is zero. Twitter vice president Ben Lee wrote in a blog post that it's suing in an effort to publish the full version of a ""transparency report"" prepared this year that includes those details. The San Francisco-based firm was unsatisfied with the Justice Department's move in January to allow technological firms to disclose the number of national security-related requests they receive in broad ranges. ""It's our belief that we are entitled under the First Amendment to respond to our users' concerns and to the statements of U.S. government officials by providing information about the scope of U.S. government surveillance -- including what types of legal process have not been received,"" Lee wrote. ""We should be free to do this in a meaningful way, rather than in broad, inexact ranges."" But a Justice Department spokeswoman pointed to the January move -- which was aimed at mollifying complaints from tech giants like Google and Microsoft -- as evidence that the government is allowing the release of at least some information on its surveillance activities. ""Earlier this year, the government addressed similar concerns raised in a lawsuit brought by several major tech companies,"" department spokeswoman Emily Pierce said. ""There, the parties worked collaboratively to allow tech companies to provide broad information on government requests while also protecting national security."" Critics of the U.S. government's secrecy surrounding its national security surveillance activities lauded Twitter's move. Jameel Jaffer, the ACLU's deputy legal director, said ""challenging this tangled web of secrecy rules and gag orders"" was the right move, and he urged other tech firms to follow Twitter's lead. ""If these laws prohibit Twitter from disclosing basic information about government surveillance, then these laws violate the First Amendment,"" Jaffer said. ""The Constitution doesn't permit the government to impose so broad a prohibition on the publication of truthful speech about government conduct.""","Twitter sues Justice Department for restrictions on what it can say about data requests .

"Depending who you ask, Yahoo's decision to hire Marissa Mayer several months into her pregnancy is either a boon to all working mothers or a misstep for the ailing tech company. ""Talk about lousy timing. She'll be taking maternity leave when she needs to be at work. Yahoo has enough problems without a part-time CEO,"" one commenter said in response to the Fortune article announcing news of her pregnancy. ""It is quite possible that she can do both effectively, but it is not un-'evolved' to express concern,"" another said, referring to Mayer's comment that Yahoo's directors demonstrated ""evolved thinking"" in choosing to hire a pregnant chief executive. ""As a Yahoo shareholder, I am very concerned and have every reason to be."" It's possible that Mayer anticipated these reactions when she revealed her plan to work during her maternity leave so she could ""stay in the rhythm of things."" Her announcement reignited an already hot debate over whether women can ""have it all"" and how family leave policies make it hard to juggle a successful career and family. Opinion: What signal is Marissa Mayer giving to Yahoo employees? But Mayer isn't your typical working mother, and some believe her experience reflects the extreme demands that corporate America places on men and women alike and how that translates to national policy. Besides, the demands of motherhood only grow with time, author and activist Gloria Feldt said. That's when benefits such as flexible scheduling, reduced work weeks and the option to work from home really make a difference in helping women get as close as possible to having it all. iReport: How do you balance career and family? ""Life only gets busier as your children grow, and that's where flexible benefits comes in,"" she said. ""We have a long way to go as a country when it comes to making those benefits accessible to everyone."" iReporter Jennifer Compton was away from work for 12 weeks after the birth of her son, Jack. But that hasn't made returning any easier, she said. Having flexible hours and remote cameras in day cares would help ease the transition, she said. ""Before, I got to spend all day with my son, and now it's only two or three hours in the evening,"" the human resources manager said in an iReport submitted to CNN.com. ""I want more time with my little guy, but I have to take what I can get. ... It's hard to balance everything."" 'Superhuman, rich or self-employed' That Mayer's pregnancy is a matter of concern to some even though it wasn't for Yahoo's board (as Mayer tells it) reflects a double-standard, Feldt said. ""It's very common for companies to negotiate time off upfront with a new hire. If she were a man, no one would judge her for taking time off, regardless of the reason,"" said Feldt, author of ""No Excuses: 9 Ways Women Can Change How We Think About Power."" Nearly 61% of women with children younger than 3 and 56% of women with children younger than 1 were in the labor force in 2011, according to Catalyst, an organization that tracks women's advancement in the workplace, citing Bureau of Labor Statistics. But ambivalence over their participation in the work force seems to persist. A 2009 Pew Research Center report found that 21% of adults said the trend toward more mothers working outside the home had been good for society; 37% said it had been bad and 38% said it hasn't made much difference. Women reported feeling stressed about balancing work and family, the report said, with 40% of working moms saying they always feel rushed compared with 24% of the general public and 26% of stay-at-home moms. As for working dads, 25% said they always feel rushed. This month's Atlantic magazine cover story, ""Why Women Still Can't Have It All,"" has stoked intense debate on the topic. Former State Department official Anne-Marie Slaughter proposes that the only women who manage to reach the pinnacle of their careers while raising a family are ""superhuman, rich or self-employed."" Slaughter chronicles her decision to leave Washington and return to academia so she can play a larger role in raising her sons, using her personal journey as a jumping off point to examine the decisions and barriers women face in balancing a career with family. In Twitter exchanges this week punctuated with the hashtag #havingitall, the Princeton University professor applauded Mayer's appointment at Yahoo but noted that it seemed to prove her thesis. ""Women who are having it all are superhuman, rich, and in charge. I'm all for Marissa Mayer! but the norm?"" she tweeted. Her exchange with Mia Farrow, who tweeted ""let's hope she inspires [corporations] to create better options for all working moms,"" underscored what feminists and policy experts have been saying for years: that corporate culture in the United States, one of few industrialized nations without paid family leave for new parents, does not foster ideal conditions for work-life balance -- for women or men. ""We live in a society where there's very little space for men or women in corporate spheres to easily juggle family lives with professional lives,"" said Caroline Heldman, chair of the Politics Department at Occidental College in California. ""When we talk about maternity leave, we assume it's only women who should be taking time off when a child is born. I think that comes from a culture where the assumption is that women are the primary caretakers and the father's bond with his children is not as important,"" Heldman said. ""I think we would have better familial bonds if we viewed parenting as something that every parent could participate in, not just women."" Someone in Mayer's position likely has the resources to enable her to work through maternity leave, but that's certainly not the norm for most working mothers. If anything, her experience is representative of the rules and expectations of CEOs of major corporations, 97% of whom are male, Heldman said. ""Her choices don't necessarily work for women in lower ranks and should not be held up as a standard for what all men or women should or could do,"" Heldman said. ""She's playing by the good old boys' rules, which uphold a system that doesn't allow space and time for male or female CEOs to really take time off if they need it."" Facing tough choices . Some parents can take time off under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which guarantees eligible employees at companies with more than 50 employees 12 weeks of unpaid, job-guaranteed leave for the birth or adoption of a child, according to Catalyst. Similar statutes exist in Washington D.C., California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state and Wisconsin. In 2002, California became the first state to enact a paid family leave act, allowing employees to take six weeks' leave and up to 55% of their weekly wages, with a benefit cap, to care for a newborn or newly adopted child. Every employee who contributes to the State Disability Insurance is covered, not just those who work for companies with 50 employees or more. Although some individual companies offer a paid maternity leave benefit, many parents end up using a combination of short-term disability, sick leave, vacation, personal days and unpaid family leave. Most working mothers return to work within a year of having a child, according to the 2009 report, ""Opting-Out: An Exploration of Labor Force Participation of New Mothers,"" based on the American Community Survey three-year data file for 2005-2007. The researchers hypothesized that two groups of women may opt out: women whose earnings are so low they may not be able to afford child care and women whose family earnings allow them to forgo personal earnings. A 2004 Catalyst study found that while senior-level women and men showed interest in informal and formal flexible work arrangements, few actually took advantage of them: 44% of women used flexible arrival and departure times, compared with 36% of men; and 13% of women telecommuted or worked from home, compared with 12% of men. Perhaps the most telling is that 91% of women and 94% of men agreed that they could be flexible with their schedules when they had a family emergency or personal matter, but only 15% of women and 20% of men said that they could use a flexible work arrangement without jeopardizing career advancement. In the absence of policies that help working mothers, some end up leaving the work force or creating their own solutions. iReporter Shadra Smith of Fort Wayne, Indiana, took a pay cut when she changed jobs after finding out she was pregnant. ""[I] took a position that unfortunately pays less, but it allows me to have the mental and physical strength for my son,"" Smith said in an iReport. ""I've already accomplished some career goals, and being a mother is the career I would love to concentrate on now."" she said.

"Feng Xiaofeng moves down an alleyway toward her home in Wuli, an ordinary village in eastern China's Zhejiang province, with an extraordinary problem. Feng slides open the doors with a quick thrust. But before she says a word, she begins to cry and points at two identically framed photos side by side on her wall. They show an older and younger man. They look like blown up passport pictures or perhaps faded formal portraits. These photographs haunt Feng. ""I don't want to stay in this house. I don't want to sleep here at night,"" she says. ""My husband was the pillar of the family and when he died it was like the pillar of our house collapsing. Then my son was taken too."" Taken 10 years apart by cancer. The sound of crying draws villagers to Feng's small courtyard. They have stories of their own. Promised riches . They say Wuli was once famed for wooded hills and fertile soil. Government officials came in the 1990s and promised riches. ""All the local officials did was fill their pockets with money,"" says an older woman angrily. During this period, a number of textile companies moved into Wuli, building their plants across town. ""All these factories should be moved, because they have caused the cancer,"" says one man, as others nod. ""All of these factories should be removed from here."" They tell us that Wuli is now a ""cancer village."" Can china breathe life into 'ghost towns'? Rural exposure . The term surfaced a few years ago, when trailblazing Chinese journalists and activists like Deng Fei unearthed evidence of unnaturally high rates of cancer across China, mostly in rural areas dominated by industry. Deng, who was working for a Hong Kong based magazine at the time, focused on the impact of water pollution in rural China. ""Since water is so important to people, the pollution has a more significant impact on people's health,"" he says. ""China is suffering from the negative impact of improper economic growth patterns. And the country will continue to pay the price for heavy pollutants in the future."" This year, facing public pressure, the government admitted that cancer villages exist. ""China has been producing and utilizing toxic chemical products. Many places experienced a drinking water crisis and pollution caused serious social issues like the emergence of cancer villages,"" stated a document published in the wake of the cancer villages revelation. Deng calls it a 'very significant step."" ""Only by acknowledging the problem can we put real efforts in dealing with this issue"" he says. But for activists like Wei Donying in Wuli Village, the acknowledgment isn't enough. She rolls out a fraying map on her living room floor. On her hands and knees, she places photos on different parts of map. ""Look at all these dead fish on the shore,"" she says, ""and here, the canal turned red."" Wei has charted the build up of toxic pollution for decades. In 2002 she had her own cancer scare, she says, when a tumor was removed. It was benign, she says. She has complained, petitioned, and become a thorn in the local government's side. She says she has been harassed and threatened for her activism. Even on the day of our interview, what we believe is a state security officer took surreptitious photographs of us talking. She said they came to ask questions when we left. She takes us on a walking tour past dyeing factories, textile mills, and weaving plants. ""This factory just took 'chemical' off their name when we complained,"" she says. ""We picketed outside this one recently."" Security guards look nervously through the gate. ""They know me well,"" she says. ""All I wish for is to breathe clean air, drink safe water and use uncontaminated soil. That's all I ask for, but I guess that is just too much to ask."" Accountability . Wei is convinced that that individual plants caused the cancer, but all of the factories dump their water, treated or not, into the same rivers, so it's nearly impossible to sort the polluters from the non-polluters. Greenpeace calls the lack of accountability ""the perfect smokescreen."" In a recent study called ""Toxic Threads,"" they contracted scientists to test water in the region and say they found at least a dozen toxic chemicals. An official with the local government in charge of Wuli, who did not wish to be named, told us, ""we are aware of the situation and we have been trying our best to combat the problems. It is our responsibility."" They did not give any details of those plans. Zhejiang province is the center of China's textile industry, the largest in the world. One way or another, this region services the majority of the world's famous clothing brands. Greenpeace has called for full transparency between suppliers and brands. They want factories to clean up their act or close. But the relationship with industry here is more complex. In the past 50 years this region has gone from subsistence farming to heavy industry. ""We complain and petition, but it is pointless, ordinary people can never fight officials and win,"" a farmer tells us near Binhai Industrial park. So, like many others here, he works in a dyeing mill at night. He says it's a dilemma that they have to learn to live with. High price . It may be the contradiction of Chinese growth, but for Feng Xaiofeng it is far simpler. She says that that industrial expansion in Wuli village has come at too high a price. She says there is no way she can be sure, but she is convinced that the factories caused the cancer of her husband and son. She hopes that the government moves her from her empty house. ""No one from the government ever bothered to come and see me or check on me."" ""I am so sad. I have no more tears to shed,"" she says.","Residents of Wuli village in eastern China refer to home as 'cancer village'

"(CNN) -- Annette Fredskov's recipe to alleviate the often crippling effects of multiple sclerosis is a curious concoction. It consists of one year, 366 marathons, 15,442 kilometers and 20 pairs of running shoes. ""It's amazing because now I know I have a diagnosis, but I know I feel healthy and I am healthy, I have no disease,"" she told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I know my body now and I also listened to my body every day during the project, so I have no fear at all. It's amazing. ""My muscles got stronger during the project and also my bones got stronger and my body found a balance, so I'm in good shape."" It wasn't always this way, though. The Dane was diagnosed with MS three years ago. The disease -- which attacks the body's central nervous system -- has several forms, ranging in seriousness. Like 85 per cent of sufferers, Fredskov has relapsing remitting MS, which means symptoms can appear then fade away, either partially or completely. Initially, it enveloped the 41-year-old, prompting a six-month spell of introspection and fear. As well as numbness down her left side, she was also blighted with dizziness and extreme tiredness. ""At one point I was really sad about that and I was feeling sorry for myself,"" Fredskov explained. ""Some days were very hard and I thought, 'What am I going to do? I can't work, I'm so tired and I'm going to sit in a wheelchair.' ""Other days I thought, 'Well, this is going to be OK, I'll handle it.' So I had six months on a rollercoaster ride, you could say. ""Then I got my act together and I thought, 'I'm feeling sorry for myself and I'm sick and it's not the way I wanted things to be, but I can decide for myself what I am going to do from now.'"" The outlet for this enduring commitment to vitality was running -- a whole lot of running. Having flirted with the sport at various stages of her life, Fredskov was a committed runner by the time her multiple sclerosis was confirmed. And it proved to be a valuable vehicle in her fight to remain physically and mentally fit. ""The curiosity about our mind and our body is really a big motivation for me that started with my diagnosis,"" said Fredskov, who has written a book about her feats. ""It's hard to explain what happened. Before I would run once in a while and I couldn't really get the hang of it, I didn't really enjoy it. But six years ago I was ready to fall in love with running."" Even the most committed of athletes would surely tremble at the prospect of completing 26 miles every day for a whole year. But Fredskov says her decision was empowering, helping to reinforce her viewpoint that she could retain an important element of control over her disease. ""A year after my first marathon, I was sitting in the car with my husband and thinking out loud, 'Wouldn't it be amazing if I could run a marathon every day for a year?!' ""Instead of just letting it go or not answering he said, 'If anybody can do it, it would be you.' ""So the dream was alive. We talked about it, it just felt right in both our stomachs. I wanted to run and he wanted to support me. I've learned that if there's anything I want to do, I can do it. ""It's not every day I just jump out of bed and say, 'Wow, this is a happy day,' but I know if I wake up and feel my head is heavy, that I'm not feeling so good, I know I can make it a good day anyway -- that's my choice. ""I can choose to be, 'Oh, tell everybody I'm not feeling so well,' or I can tell myself, 'No, I want to feel good and tell everybody I'm feeling good.' It's my choice. That's kind of a freedom."" Even scrolling through the complete list of Fredskov's marathons on her website is exhausting. All of them were completed in Denmark, most around the town of NÃ¦stved. Unsurprisingly, Fredskov's very first marathon was her quickest, clocking in at four hours, 25 minutes and 30 seconds. She drank two liters of soda a day to keep her body infused with sugar, got through a pair of running shoes every 18 days, and maintained an average time of around five hours. ""There were lonely moments, because I was the only one doing this,"" she explained. ""Sometimes I just felt so tired and thought, 'Nobody knows what I'm feeling right now,' and that sometimes felt lonely. ""Also when people told me, 'You can do this, try that,' and I thought you don't know what you're talking about because I'm the only one who has tried to run a marathon and it's hard -- I'm tired!"" A glutton for punishment, Fredskov decided to run not one but two marathons on her 365th day, spending a total of 10 hours and 45 minutes pounding the roads. ""When I got to the finish line, I had no words,"" she said. ""It was overwhelming, my head was empty. The only thing going through my mind was thank you for everything. ""I ran over the finish line and my kids and my husband were there ready to hug me, and Emilia and Victor they made a big sign saying, 'You are awesome mum!' ""I just started crying -- it was the best day of my life. I have a lot of those but it's going into history."" As you might have guessed, her marathon year isn't the limit of Fredskov's ambitions, and another assignment is already in the pipeline. ""My next challenge in the running shoes is completing five marathons in 48 hours,"" she reports.","Multiple sclerosis sufferer Annette Fredskov ran 366 marathons in 365 days .

"The container ship Maersk Alabama has seen a lot of drama. It was attacked in 2009 by four armed Somali pirates, who took the ship's captain, Richard Phillips, hostage on a lifeboat. That gripping tale came to Hollywood in the form of the 2013 film ""Captain Phillips."" The ship survived another pirate attack in 2009 and yet another attempt to board the vessel in 2011. And now: Two former Navy SEALs, hired as security officers on the 500-foot vessel, were found dead aboard. Seychelles police say the autopsy found the cause of death to be ""respiratory failure, with suspicion of myocardial infarction (heart attack)."" The presence of a syringe and traces of heroin in the cabin have led to a suspicion of drug use, police said. More than a week after their bodies were discovered, many questions surround the deaths of Jeffrey Reynolds and Mark Kennedy, both 44 years old. Why did they die together? How did the drugs and syringe get into their cabin? What series of events contributed to their deaths? Such questions are made more mysterious by friends, family and others who knew the men and told the New York Times that after their years in the military, they had readjusted well to civilian life. The night before their bodies were discovered, the men went to two bars, followed by two casinos, the New York Times reported, in Port of Victoria, Seychelles. New York Times reporter Ian Urbina told CNN's Brooke Baldwin that according to staff where the men are said to have been on that night out, Reynolds and Kennedy were ""outgoing"" and ""having a great time"" and drank tequila shots and vodka with sailors from New Zealand. ""The two (former) Navy SEALs ended up closing that (second) casino and were politely asked to go at the end of the evening,""  Urbina said. Surveillance images indicate that they met two women in the hall in front of the second casino and ""walked down a dark corridor"" with them, Urbina said. A colleague who had gone to check in with one of the men in a cabin found them at 4:30 p.m. February 18, Seychelles police said. ""It's bizarre. Of course, it's a shock. They're all great guys,"" said Tom Rothrauff, president of Trident Group, a Virginia-based maritime security services firm that employed them. ""I'm absolutely clueless as to what happened."" Although substance abuse is a known problem among veterans, acquaintances of Reynolds' and Kennedy's told the New York Times they were shocked at the idea that either man had used heroin. ""The description of the two men from friends and family was in stark contrast to what sounded like a pretty hard partying night,"" Urbina said. A neighbor of Reynolds', Monika Connelly, told the Times that the Reynoldses did not drink alcohol. Another neighbor, Paul Bell, called them ""church people."" Both Reynolds and Kennedy had children and ""seemed to be family men,"" Urbina said. Bodily fluid samples from the two men are being sent to Mauritius for further analysis ""to establish if they had consumed a substance which may have induced these events,"" Seychelles police said in a statement. Lt. Cmdr. Jamie Frederick, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman, said the service was investigating the deaths, as required by American law. But he said the deaths ""do not appear to be criminal in nature, related to vessel operations, the material condition of the ship or their duties as security personnel."" The ship arrived in the Seychelles on February 16 with a 24-man crew. It was expected to leave two days later. The Seychelles, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, has one of the highest rates of injection drug use in the world, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (PDF), with 2.3% of the population engaging in this behavior. Kevin N. Speers, a senior director for Maersk Line, said in a statement that the security contractors boarded the vessel January 29 and that their deaths were ""not related to vessel operations or their duties as security personnel."" The Maersk Alabama is ""persistently in high-risk areas since she provides feeder service to the east coast of Africa,"" Speers said in a statement. ""Contracted security is part of anti-piracy protection plans to safeguard crews and vessels,"" Speers said. But according to The New York Times, Reynolds and Kennedy told friends that on the open sea, the real enemy is boredom.

"As Beijing touts a high-profile crackdown on corruption, experts say it should look south to Hong Kong as an example of a Chinese territory that has succeeded in cutting out the rot. Four decades ago, Hong Kong was one of the most corrupt cities in the world, according to anti-corruption organization Transparency International. ""I would compare Hong Kong [in the 1970s] to Argentina today,"" said Ran Liao, the group's senior program coordinator. Transparency International has only been publishing its Corruption Perceptions Index since 1995 but, had data on Hong Kong been available at the time, Liao said it would have rated at a similar levels not only to Argentina, but Gabon and Tanzania. According to its latest Corruption Perceptions Index, all three countries score a lowly 35 out of 100, on a sliding scale from 0 (""highly corrupt"") to 100 (""very clean."") Hong Kong, meanwhile, earns 77 out of 100, placing it at number 14 of 176 countries; meaning it's perceived as slightly more corrupt than Germany (13) but less corrupt than the United Kingdom (17) and the United States (19). How did Hong Kong clean up its act? Change came to the former British colony following mass street protests after Peter Godber, the then police superintendent, fled the territory while being investigated for alleged corruption. The outcry led to the formation of the Independent Commission Against Corruption, a government body with wide investigative powers. But the changes weren't only aimed at officials. ""They adopted a three-pronged approach, that means punishment, education and prevention,"" Liao said. The education starts at local kindergartens, where characters created by ICAC present children with ethical dilemmas and stories where the honest one always wins. ""We don't teach them about the laws but we teach them about the values,"" said Monica Yu, executive director of the Hong Kong Ethics Development Centre, an ICAC division. Hong Kongers 'will never tolerate corruption' Two generations after adopting this approach against skirting the rules, Yu says there's evidence of a major cultural shift in the attitude of the local Chinese population. ""We measure the tolerance level of the people to corruption, from a scale of zero to 10. Zero means total intolerance and 10 means total tolerance. For the last decade or so, the average was 0.8, 0.7 or so,"" Yu said. And this drew Yu to the following conclusion: ""Nowadays in Hong Kong, people will never tolerate corruption."" She says the lack of tolerance for rule-breaking reinforces ethical behavior, both in private and public spheres, as violators are named and shamed by their peers. ""Very often people would come forward to ICAC to report corruption, whenever they suspected there was a case. That's a big difference compared with before the ICAC was set up,"" Yu said. Liao agreed. ""Before the ICAC there was nobody to think about such a comprehensive way to fight against corruption,"" he said. When jail is the only remedy for corruption it shows there's another problem: there's no real fight against it. ""Punishment means you have committed the misconduct,"" Liao said. ""Prevention is very important, [the ICAC] talks to different sectors, for example, the banking and the construction sectors."" The ICAC publishes guidelines for business and tries to identify operations with high potential risks. The institution also organizes events to talk about these issues and push the prevention agenda in the business and government sectors. In that process, employees are told how and to whom to report suspected wrongdoing. How corrupt is China? The distaste for corruption in Hong Kong contrasts with the situation in China, which ranks just below Sri Lanka in the Corruption Perception Index -- sharing 80th place with Serbia and Trinidad and Tobago in the ranking of 176 countries. Its low placing is unlikely to change anytime soon, Liao said. ""In China now, most of the corrupt officials would compete to see whoever received more bribes."" The traditional giving of cash-filled red envelopes during festivals and special occasions has expanded to encompass paying officials for favors, a practice denounced recently by mainland Chinese state media. Nor will China's recent well publicized conviction of former high-flying politician Bo Xilai on corruption charges change day-to-day realities, said Liao, because stamping out corruption is not simply a legal issue. ""Even today, many of the country's top leaders think fighting corruption means putting people in jail,"" Liao said. ""People in Hong Kong would take it as shameful to receive bribes,"" said Liao. China needs ""a society-wide change in values,"" he added.","40 years ago, corruption was rife in Hong Kong, experts say .
Now it's considered one of the least corrupt territories in the world .
China, however, rates poorly on the index by Transparency International .
It's in 80th place on the Corruption Perceptions Index, near Serbia and Trinidad and Tobago ."
"Washington (CNN) -- Senate Democrats failed Thursday to win a procedural vote to open debate on a bill that would provide medical benefits and compensation for emergency workers who were first on the scene of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The motion for cloture, or to begin debate, needed 60 votes to pass due to a Republican filibuster, but fell short at 57-42 in favor. While supporters said they would try to bring the bill up again, either on its own or as part of other legislation to be considered, the vote Thursday jeopardized the measure's chances for approval in the final weeks of the current congressional session. The House previously passed the bill on a mostly partisan 268-160 vote. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reacted to Thursday's result by calling it ""a tragic example of partisan politics trumping patriotism."" ""I urge Senate Republicans to reconsider their wrong-headed political strategy and allow the bill to come to the floor for a vote,"" Bloomberg said in a statement. Republicans complained that the $7.4 billion price tag was too high, while Democrats said the government had an obligation to help the first responders to the deadliest terrorism attack in U.S. history. The James Zadroga 9/11 Health Bill -- named after a deceased New York Police Department detective who had worked in the toxic plume at ground zero -- seeks to provide free medical coverage for responders and survivors who were exposed to toxins after the attacks.","Motion for cloture falls three votes short of ending GOP filibuster .

"A nurse under mandatory quarantine in New Jersey after caring for Ebola patients in Sierra Leone has blasted stringent new state policies for dealing with health care workers returning from West Africa, saying the change could lead to medical professionals being treated like ""criminals and prisoners."" In a first-person account in The Dallas Morning News, Kaci Hickox wrote that she was ordered placed in quarantine at a hospital, where she has now tested negative in two tests for Ebola. Still, hospital officials told her she must remain under quarantine for 21 days. ""This is not a situation I would wish on anyone, and I am scared for those who will follow me,"" she wrote. Dr. Seema Yasmin, a friend of Hickox who has been in contact with her during her quarantine, told CNN's Elizabeth Cohen that Hickox is feeling physically fine and showing no symptoms. That contradicts what New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said in a press conference Saturday, when he said Hickox was ""obviously ill."" Yasmin has been texting with Hickox and told CNN the nurse is ""very sad"" and ""exhuasted."" Yasmin also told CNN she is worried about the conditions Hickox is being held in -- the nurse told Yasmin she is in an unheated room and was given only paper scrubs to wear. Doctors Without Borders said in a written statement that it is ""very concerned about the conditions,"" saying Hickox is in an unheated tent adjacent to the hospital. The group's statement also said it is working to get information from hospital officials. In Saturday's press conference, Christie said he was ""sorry if in any way she (Hickox) was inconvenienced,"" but stated that the public health and safety of the people of New Jersey are his ""first and foremost obligation."" A mandatory quarantine imposed by New York, New Jersey and Illinois on health care workers who just returned to the United States from treating Ebola patients in West Africa has prompted a debate on how to prevent the spread of the disease without discouraging medical aid workers from fighting it. The isolation policy was abruptly implemented Friday by the governors of New York and New Jersey, Andrew Cuomo and Christie. The announcement came one day after a New York doctor who treated patients in Guinea became the first Ebola case diagnosed in New York City. Should health care workers be quarantined? The change to mandatory isolation for 21 days, which is thought to be Ebola's incubation period, was implemented the same day that Hickox landed at Newark Liberty International Airport after working with Doctors Without Borders in Sierra Leone. She said that she was held at the airport and questioned by various health workers after her flight landed at about 1 p.m. At first, her temperature -- taken with a forehead scanner -- was 98 degrees. Hours later, with her cheeks flushed with anger over being held without explanation, another scanner check recorded her temperature as 101 degrees, she wrote. ""The female officer looked smug. 'You have a fever now,'"" she wrote. ""I explained that an oral thermometer would be more accurate and that the forehead scanner was recording an elevated temperature because I was flushed and upset."" She eventually got a police escort to a hospital, where her temperature was measured again at 98.6 degrees -- normal. And she tested negative for Ebola, she wrote in the Dallas newspaper. How the Ebola virus spreads . ""I had spent a month watching children die, alone,"" she wrote. ""I had witnessed human tragedy unfold before my eyes. I had tried to help when much of the world has looked on and done nothing. ...  I sat alone in the isolation tent (in New Jersey) and thought of many colleagues who will return home to America and face the same ordeal. Will they be made to feel like criminals and prisoners?"" Hickox fears it will discourage some colleagues from taking up the necessary fight. New Jersey health officials said that a preliminary test showed that Hickox does not have Ebola. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed a second Ebola test came back negative. The primary goal of University Hospital in Newark, where Hickox is under quarantine, is to ""make sure the patient is as comfortable as possible,"" hospital spokeswoman Stacie Newton said. The New Jersey Department of Health did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment regarding the nurse's allegations. CDC: Outbreak won't end without volunteers . New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett shares Hickox's concerns that the mandatory quarantine will discourage doctors and nurses from volunteering to take care of Ebola patients in West Africa, according to her spokeswoman. ""We just want to make sure we don't inadvertently discourage volunteers who are going to West Africa to help control this epidemic,"" said health department spokeswoman Jean Weinberg.

"London (CNN) -- The embattled British tabloid News of the World, one of the oldest and best-selling newspapers in Britain, will shut down after Sunday's issue, its owner, News International, told CNN Thursday. The dramatic announcement follows accusations that the paper illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terror victims, politicians and celebrities. The scandal could have far-reaching consequences and may be politically damaging to Prime Minister David Cameron. British media reported Thursday that Andy Coulson, Cameron's former director of communications, has been told by police that he should go to a police station to be arrested Friday morning over his alleged knowledge or involvement in the mobile phone-hacking practices that took place while he was editor of the News of the World. He resigned as editor of the newspaper in January 2007 after the News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman and a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, were jailed for intercepting voicemail messages on royal aides' phones. After Coulson moved to his communications role with the Conservative party, the scandal resurfaced. He was questioned by police in November and resigned from his Downing Street position in January, despite the Crown Prosecution Service ruling that there was ""no admissible evidence"" to bring criminal charges. British media have reported that Coulson will be formally questioned on Friday under suspicion of involvement in hacking and have speculated that he is likely to be released on bail and appear in court at a later date, alongside other arrested former News of the World journalists. Coulson has previously insisted that he did not know about widespread phone hacking at the newspaper and offered, last year, to meet with police voluntarily to discuss the case. News International Chairman James Murdoch said Thursday, in announcing the shutdown, that the scandal ""sullied"" the newspaper and ""has no place in our company."" And paying out-of-court settlements to some victims was ""wrong and a matter of serious regret,"" Murdoch said. He is a son of media magnate Rupert Murdoch, the head of News Corp., which owns News International. The paper's roughly 200 employees are now out of jobs, but are free to apply for other positions within News International, the company said. ""The rug's being pulled out from underneath our feet,"" said David Wooding, political editor at the News of the World. ""I can only assume he (Murdoch) feels the brand has been so badly damaged that the best thing to do is a scorched earth policy and get rid of it. But it's one hell of a decision."" The National Union of Journalists condemned the move to shut down the paper. ""James Murdoch was absolutely right when he said in his statement today that 'Wrongdoers turned a good newsroom bad.' Yet those wrongdoers are still there today, at the top of the News International empire and ordinary staff at the paper are paying with their livelihoods,"" NUJ General Secretary Michelle Stanistreet said in a statement. The 168-year-old newspaper, which sells more than 2.5 million copies every Sunday, was brought down by an avalanche of public and political fury in the wake of revelations that the hacking victims included a missing 13-year-old girl who was later found to have been murdered. In an interview for UK media, James Murdoch said he, his father and the company felt ""regret"" over what had happened. He insisted he was satisfied that Rebekah Brooks -- the current chief executive of News International and former editor of the News of the World who has been the target of calls to step down -- ""neither had knowledge of nor directed the activities."" He said the company was committed to doing the right thing, by cooperating with police and putting in place a process to make sure such practices did not happen again. All revenue from the paper's final edition will go to ""good causes,"" he said earlier. On Wednesday, Rupert Murdoch himself called allegations against his flagship Sunday paper ""deplorable and unacceptable."" Prime Minister Cameron Wednesday called the possibility that the hacking had taken place ""absolutely disgusting"" and backed calls for an independent inquiry into the affair after a police investigation concludes. The scandal is potentially damaging to Cameron himself because he is close to current and former top officials at the News of the World's parent company, former Tony Blair spokesman Alastair Campbell told CNN Thursday. Police launched a special investigation into the allegations of phone hacking on behalf of the newspaper in January of this year. It was the second police probe into the issue. On Thursday, shortly before James Murdoch's announcement, police said they have identified the names of nearly 4,000 potential victims. Police launched the new investigation this year in response to widespread complaints from high-profile figures who feared they may have been targets. But the revelation this week that victims may have included the murdered girl, the families of terror victims and of British troops killed in Afghanistan and Iraq, raised the scandal to a new level. The Royal British Legion, a top military veterans' organization, said Thursday it was suspending ties with the newspaper after the accusations. A flood of advertisers announced Wednesday and Thursday that they were dropping campaigns with the tabloid. Prof. Steven Fielding, at the Centre for British Politics at the University of Nottingham, told CNN it seemed News International had decided the brand was so badly damaged that it made more sense to close the paper. But he believes the company will soon launch another paper in its place. ""I'm deeply skeptical that this actually means they will not be producing a Sunday paper in the near future, relaunched and repackaged -- a Sunday newspaper that will do very similar things to the News of the World, because it's the biggest selling Sunday (paper). It's a cash cow that will be subsidizing other papers, certainly The Times."" Chris Goodall, an analyst at the media research firm Enders Analysis, said the News of the World was the ""sacrificial lamb being taken out into the desert and killed"" in order to try to save the Murdoch empire's bid to take over UK broadcaster BSkyB. ""It's a recognition that for whatever reason, the News of the World was affecting the public perception of the bid for BSkyB and was likely to make it more difficult, so it was easier and cheaper to close it down,"" he told CNN. He suggested News International might publish the News of the World's sister paper, The Sun, seven days a week instead. Meanwhile, News International says it is co-operating with the police investigation into the accusations against it, which also include bribing police officers, and has welcomed ""calls for a broad public inquiry into standards and practices in the industry."" The company is ""close to identifying"" how the hacking of murdered teenager Milly Dowler's phone happened, a News International source told CNN, declining to be named discussing internal corporate business. The revelation that the girl's phone had been hacked after she was reported missing in 2002, and that messages were deleted, giving her parents hope she was alive when she had already been murdered, outraged Britain this week. News International said Thursday that if the accusation of hacking into the messages of fallen troops' families was true, ""we are absolutely appalled and horrified."" It made similar statements about the Milly Dowler accusation and the allegation it had targeted the families of people killed in the July 7, 2005, suicide bombings in London. Graham Foulkes, whose son was killed in the terrorist attack, said Wednesday his phone number and home address were found in the files of a private investigator working for the News of the World. ""We are no longer talking about politicians and celebrities but murder victims, potentially terrorist victims. It's absolutely disgusting what has taken place,"" Cameron said Wednesday. ""I think everyone in this house and country will be revolted by what they've heard and seen on their TV screens."" But Cameron said the inquiry could not begin until after the police investigation was done, for fear of interfering with it. On Thursday, London's Metropolitan Police said they were asking the Independent Police Complaints Commission to investigate the possible bribery of police officers by people working for the media group. The announcement came a day after the police said they would investigate the case themselves. ""However, in view of the significant public and political concern expressed following the publication of this information,"" police Thursday ""made a formal referral to the IPCC,"" they said in a statement. News International Wednesday confirmed it had given police paperwork related to the possible bribery, calling the handover evidence of its ""determination as a company to deal responsibly and correctly with the issues."" Phone hacking involves calling a phone from two other phones at the same time, sending one caller to voice mail. That caller then enters the code number to retrieve voice mail remotely. Hackers depend on the fact that many people never change the default PIN for voice mail retrieval. The paper has apologized for hacking into the voice mails of celebrities and politicians, paying compensation to actress Sienna Miller and offering money to others. At least five people have been arrested in connection with phone hacking investigations this year since a new investigation, Operation Weeting, was launched in January. Private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and a journalist working for the News of the World were sent to prison in 2007 for hacking into the voice mails of royal staff in an earlier investigation. News of the World was the first British Fleet Street newspaper Rupert Murdoch bought, in 1969, as he began to propel himself from Australian newspaper proprietor to international media magnate. In addition to owning News of the World, News International owns the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times in Britain. Murdoch's News Corp. also encompasses Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Harper Collins publishers.

"(CNN) -- The recent drought has ruined millions of acres of farmland in Texas, turning lakes into mud puddles, but in the East Texas city of Nacogdoches, authorities say, the drought may have done something good: Unearthed a piece of the space shuttle Columbia. The object, which is about 4 feet in diameter, was found in a  local lake.  NASA says it is a tank that provides power and water for shuttle missions. ""It's one of ours,"" said Lisa Malone, a spokeswoman for the agency. Malone added that NASA is trying to develop a plan to recover the item, but it could take weeks to get it. ""We're looking into whether we'll send a team out or local authorities can,"" Malone said. Authorities say the object was found after the drought caused the waters to recede in Lake Nacogdoches, and they notified representatives from NASA on Friday. ""The lower water level has exposed a larger than normal area on the northern side of the lake,"" said Sgt. Greg Sowell of the Nacogdoches Police Department. The item is full of mud and is in a remote area near a private shoreline, Sowell said. Nacogdoches made headlines in 2003 when debris from the shuttle Columbia disaster was found there. The spacecraft broke up while re-entering Earth's atmosphere near the end of its mission on February 1, 2003. ""We want to remind everyone that the rules are the same as they were back in 2003. If this object is indeed a part of the shuttle, it is government property, and it is a criminal offense to tamper with it,"" Sowell said. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","The object is a tank that provides power and water for shuttle missions .

"Hours before the top diplomats from his nation and the United States begin a high-stakes meeting, Russian President Vladimir Putin took to The New York Times to argue against military intervention in Syria and jab his U.S. counterpart. Using an op-ed ""to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders ... at a time of insufficient communication between our societies,"" Putin made a case much like U.S. President Barack Obama did Tuesday night -- although their arguments could hardly have been more different. Striking Syria would have many negative ramifications, Putin argued in a piece that went online Wednesday night, including the killing of innocent people, spreading violence around the Middle East, clouding diplomatic efforts to address Iran's nuclear crisis and resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and ""unleash(ing) a new wave of terrorism."" Moreover, the Russian leader said such action without the U.N. Security Council's approval ""would constitute an act of aggression."" ""It could throw the entire system of international law and order out of balance,"" Putin said. Contrast this to Obama's assertion that failing to act in Syria opens the door to more chemical weapons attacks in Syria and in other nations -- as well as among terrorist groups -- by giving the impression that the international community won't act in the face of blatant violations on bans of their use. And whereas the U.S. president blamed the August 21 sarin gas attack that U.S. officials estimate killed 1,400 people squarely on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Putin wrote ""there is every reason to believe it was used not by the Syrian army, but by opposition forces to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons, who would be siding with the fundamentalists."" Calling Syria's ongoing civil war an ""internal conflict, fueled by foreign weapons supplied to the opposition,"" Putin cautioned against siding with an opposition in Syria he says includes ""more than enough (al) Qaeda fighters and extremists of all stripes."" (He did not mention the fact Russia has long supplied arms to Syria's government, or that U.S. officials have said they are funneling aid only to members of what they call the ""moderate opposition."") The Russian president ended his op-ed -- just after mentioning a ""growing trust"" between him and his U.S. counterpart -- with a swipe at a remark Obama made Tuesday contending that ""with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death and thereby make our own children safer over the long run."" ""I believe we should act,"" Obama said then. ""That's what makes America different. That's what makes us exceptional. With humility, but with resolve, let us never lose sight of that essential truth."" Putin challenged the statement, saying, ""It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation."" ""We are all different,"" the Russian leader concluded, ""but when we ask for the Lord's blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal."" Reacting to that remark and Putin's op-ed generally, a senior White House official said Wednesday night ""that's all irrelevant."" ""He's fully invested in Syria's (chemical weapons) disarmament and that's potentially better than a military strike, which would deter and degrade but wouldn't get rid of all the chemical weapons,"" the official said. ""(Putin) now owns this,"" the official added of the Russian plan to have Syria's leadership give up its chemical weapons. ""He has fully asserted ownership of it, and he needs to deliver."" All eyes turn to U.S.-Russia talks in Geneva . Putin's piece went online around the time U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry headed to Geneva, Switzerland, to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Their two days of talks will revolve around a Moscow proposal to avert a U.S.-led strike in Syria by having the Syrian government put its chemical weapons stockpile under international control. In his speech Tuesday, Obama said he was willing to test the seriousness and feasibility of the initiative before resuming his push for congressional authorization for military action, which at the moment appears unlikely to succeed. Kerry is taking the lead in dealing with the Russians. That includes regular conversations with Lavrov, including Wednesday when the two talked by phone about ""their shared objective of  having a substantive discussion about the mechanics of identifying, verifying and ultimately destroying Assad's chemical weapons,"" said a senior State Department official. ""It's too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments,"" Obama said in his prime-time address to a war-weary public skeptical of another military venture in the Middle East. ""But this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force, particularly because Russia is one of Assad's strongest allies."" Russian officials have submitted a plan to the United States, Russia's Itar-Tass news agency reported Wednesday, citing a Russian diplomatic source. Yet White House spokesman Jay Carney said that while conversations have taken place, he was unaware of a full, formal proposal. ""I think we're not at the stage of putting down public pieces of paper,"" he said. Vladimir Chizhov, Russia's emissary to the European Union, said the plan calls for Syria's chemical weapons to be placed under international supervision -- inside that country initially, at least. ""The ultimate aim is to have these weapons destroyed,"" Chizhov told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. He acknowledged the task of gaining control of the weapons and destroying them with a civil war raging in Syria won't be easy, voicing worries about what rebel fighters might do. Separately, the United States, France, and Britain discussed a U.N. Security Council draft resolution, according to a spokesman for British Prime Minister David Cameron. How long will window be open? Ambassadors from the U.N. Security Council's five permanent members -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France -- met the same day for less than an hour, a diplomat with knowledge of the meeting said. While the focus now is on Switzerland, U.N. headquarters in New York is expected to become the focal point early next week when U.N. chemical weapons inspectors deliver their report to the Security Council -- as early as Monday or Tuesday, sources say -- on the August 21 attack in Syria. In Washington, the debate about what the United States should do in Syria is not over.  While Obama has said he wants to give the diplomatic process a chance, he hasn't said how long he'll wait before possibly pushing again for military action. After his meeting earlier this week with Senate Democrats, Sen. Dick Durbin said the president asked lawmakers ""for some time to work things out -- a matter of days into next week."" Another Senate Democrat, though, said it could take weeks to determine if diplomatic efforts will pan out. Members of Congress will watch Kerry's trip closely for a sense of Obama's next move after weeks of beating the drum for military action against Syria. ""If diplomacy fails, he's painted himself into a corner,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham said after Obama's speech. ""The leader of the free world can't say all these things at the end of the day and do nothing."" Senior State Department officials have cautioned that negotiations over the proposed deal may not conclude after the scheduled round of talks in Geneva. The plan would be to take any final deal to the U.N. Security Council to be formalized in a resolution. Outcome far from certain . While that process unfolds -- if it does successfully -- Obama continued to keep the door open for military action, despite exhortations from Putin that he drop any hint of a threat. The U.S. president has said any military operation in Syria would be targeted, limited and not involve U.S. ground forces. Its goal would be to degrade al-Assad's ability to use chemical weapons. Obama has also said any strike would be effective -- saying Tuesday that ""the United States military doesn't do pinpricks"" -- and he has ordered armed forces to be poised in the region ""to keep the pressure on Assad."" U.S.-funded (if not U.S.-made) weapons began flowing to Syrian rebels about two weeks ago, a U.S. official said. Coordinated by the CIA, the supplies include light weapons, ammunition and anti-tank weapons in addition to nonlethal aid the United States has long been providing. A big question looming over the diplomatic talks is whether any U.N. resolution includes a potential for military action should al-Assad not cooperate. That's something the United States and its allies have favored, while Putin has said his country could veto any measure there that contains such a threat. CNN Poll: Part of Syria strike opposition is the messenger's fault . Analysts say Kerry, as leader of the U.S. diplomatic efforts, has his work cut out for him. ""I think it's unlikely the Russian government is going to relent on this issue of whether or not it would support the use of force in a security council resolution,"" said Nicholas Burns, a former senior State Department official now at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. ""They've been consistent since day one of the Syrian crisis that they did not want to see the United States or anyone else use force. I think that's one of the ambitions the Russians have going into this negotiation in Geneva,"" he added. Obama makes case: opinion . Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in an exclusive interview on CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" that Kerry must not take the threat of force off the table in his talks with the Russians even if they insist he drop it. ""This is the way that diplomacy works. You use the threat of the use of force to get some action in diplomacy, and then diplomacy just to figure out what you do about the threat of the use of force,"" said Albright, who served as America's top diplomat under President Bill Clinton. ""One of the things I know from trying to get Security Council resolutions is that they take a while,"" said Albright. ""But my personal feeling here is that it is that threat of the use of force, and the president made very clear that our ships would stay in the area, and that the use of force would stay on the table.""","Putin's op-ed is ""irrelevant"" and he ""needs to deliver"" on Syria, U.S. official says .

"The Seattle City Council just voted to put low-wage workers on a path over the next several years to earning a $15-per-hour minimum wage. You may think, ""There goes the crazy upper left corner of the country again"" -- but there's method to our madness. This historic measure came after a five-month process that brought together business and civic leaders, unions and nonprofits in tough negotiations. But the real fuel for Seattle's action came from a growing unease across the United States with income inequality. You could argue that some level of income inequality is required for our system. That inequality is tolerable, though, because it's coupled with a promise: ""Work hard and you'll get ahead."" But more of us every day worry that the promise is fading. After the job losses of the Great Recession, the rise of the 1 percent, the headlines showing CEO pay at 257 times average worker pay, the evidence that race and gender exacerbate income inequality, doubts that this generation of kids will be better off than their parents, crushing student debt burdens, and relentless foreclosures, many are left wondering if the middle class was a fleeting 20th-century phenomenon heading toward extinction. Over the course of the last five months, as we've debated whether and how to raise the minimum wage in Seattle, I've talked with business owners and workers alike concerned with the widening distance between low-wage workers and the rest of the economy. They all had different thoughts, but they were almost unanimous that we can't keep going the way we're going. We just can't expect the people who prepare our food, care for our elders and children, and clean our homes and offices to earn wages that keep them trapped in poverty. These conversations are playing out in cities and towns all over America as people look at their wages, their household expenses, their hopes for their kids and their dreams of retirement. Am I worried about what we're doing in Seattle? You bet I am. No other large city has committed to this kind of minimum wage increase. Restaurants are concerned about already thin profits in the industry and wage imbalance between front of house and back of house; small manufacturers are worried they'll be even less competitive with manufacturers in other parts of the country and world; and nonprofit human service agencies don't know whether funders will step up to cover increased staff costs. In truth, it would be preferable to see minimum wage increases happening at the state or national level as a more equitable way to raise the wages of working people and help businesses thrive on a level playing field. However, gridlock at those levels pushes the fight into cities all over the country. As promised, here's the method to the madness: The $15 per hour figure is a bit art and a bit science, but it's close to what experts say it costs in our area for a full-time worker to meet basic needs (housing, food, utilities, transportation, etc.). At Washington state's current minimum wage of $9.32 per hour, the highest state wage in the country, a worker still takes home far less than needed to make rent and pay the bills. A higher minimum wage means more stable individuals, families, neighborhoods and towns. A higher minimum wage means being able to buy your child a pair of shoes. A higher minimum wage means more consumer spending and, I hope, a little more consumer saving. And, no, minimum wage earners aren't going to suddenly become complacent and sit for years in minimum wage jobs. Minimum wage workers have dreams of advancement and accomplishment just like anyone else. A higher minimum wage might mean presenting a truer cost to consumers. If you think it's odd that a burger, fries and a shake can cost just $4, that's because that price is subsidized in part by the low wages paid to the people who cook, serve, and clean up after your meal. Seattle -- already in a state with the nation's highest minimum wage -- was recently announced as one of America's fastest growing cities. If a high wage is a ""job killer"" as some critics say, the experience of cities that have raised wages undermines this too-convenient excuse for inaction. I love my city because of our neighborhoods alive with locally owned shops and restaurants. My city is thriving because of our music and theater scene. My city is productive because of jobs generated by Amazon, Starbucks, the Gates Foundation and the University of Washington. (Puget Sound and Mount Rainier don't hurt either.) We need the plan we've adopted for getting to $15 per hour to work so that we pass a great Seattle on to the next generation, a Seattle that struggles just a little less to make ends meet. Here in the upper left corner of the country, we are taking bold steps to save the dream of an American middle class. We may be just one city, but we are providing a pathway for action in the national conversation to reduce income inequality. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Sally J.

"Secretary of State John Kerry raised eyebrows Sunday following comments, caught on an open mic, that left some wondering whether he was criticizing Israeli assurances that its ground offensive in Gaza would be limited. Kerry's comments occurred between multiple television interviews. He was heard in a phone conversation with a State Department deputy, Jonathan Finer, discussing the deaths of Israeli soldiers killed overnight. ""I hope they don't think that's an invitation to go do more,"" Kerry said in the unguarded moment.  ""That better be the warning to them."" At that point, Finer is heard mentioning the number of Palestinians wounded and killed in the past 24 hours. ""It's a hell of a pinpoint operation. It's a hell of a pinpoint operation,"" Kerry said, a seemingly frustrated comment aimed at Israel. ""Right,"" Finer responded. Noting that the situation is ""escalating,"" Finer added: ""it just underscores the need for a cease fire."" ""We've got to get over there,"" Kerry said, adding, ""I think, Jon, we ought to go tonight.  I think it's crazy to be sitting around.  Let's go."" In a later interview with ""Fox News Sunday,"" host Chris Wallace played the recording for Kerry. ""When you said 'It's a hell of a pinpoint operation,' are you upset that the Israelis are going too far?"" Wallace asked.  ""And, in fact, do you intend to go back to the Middle East tonight, sir?"" ""I think it's very, very difficult in these situations, obviously very difficult, Chris,"" Kerry replied. ""You have people who've come out of tunnels.  You have a right to go in and take out those tunnels.  We completely support that.  And we support Israel's right to defend itself against rockets that are continuing to come in.   Hamas has started this process of rocketing, after Israel was trying to find the people who killed three young -- you know, one American kid, three young Israeli citizens.  It's disgraceful."" Kerry continued: ""And so, yes, it's tough.  It's tough to have this kind of operation.  And I reacted obviously in a way that, you know, anybody does with respect to young children and civilians.  But war is tough, and I said that publicly and I'll say it again.  We defend Israel's right to do what it is doing in order to get at those tunnels.""

"(CNN) -- Members of a well-known hacking group -- according to a statement and Twitter messages -- took credit Sunday for an online attack targeting San Francisco's embattled transit system. Anonymous -- in a news release attributed to the group, and backed up by related Twitter pages -- said it would take down the website of the Bay Area Rapid Transit System, known as BART, between noon and 6 p.m. PT Sunday. This is in response to the system's decision to cut off cellphone signals at ""select"" subway stations in response to a planned protest last week. ""By (cutting cell service), you have not only threatened your citizens' safety, you have also performed an act of censorship,"" a seemingly computer-generated voice -- speaking over dramatic music and images -- said in a video posted online Sunday afternoon. ""By doing this, you have angered Anonymous."" On Sunday afternoon, a link off BART's website to myBART.org apparently had been hacked. It showed a page featuring, among other items, the Anonymous logo -- a smirking mask above two crossed swords, all on a black background. In addition, Twitter traffic related to Anonymous boasted that hackers had been able to get into BART's internal network. Several related items and documents were posted, including one claiming to be ""the User Info Database of MyBart.gov."" This had e-mails and, in some cases, phone numbers of hundreds of people. ""We apologize to any citizen that has his information published, but you should go to BART and ask them why your information wasn't secure with them,"" the posted item said. ""Also do not worry, probably the only information that will be abused from this database is that of BART employees."" A call to a BART communication officer was not immediately returned. In a statement on its website released earlier in the day, BART acknowledged that it was aware of the threatened online attack -- and was taking steps in response. ""We're doing what we can to defend against any attack on the BART website,"" the system said. ""BART's website infrastructure is wholly separate from any computer network involved in the operation of BART service."" In recent years, the hacking collective calling itself Anonymous has targeted several organizations to make political statements. Last week, for instance, Anonymous promised an ""operation"" targeting Facebook. And it took credit for hacking the site of the Syrian Defense Ministry, replacing its content with an anti-government message and the Anonymous logo. Anonymous also has boasted about taking down numerous other prominent websites, including those of PayPal, MasterCard, Visa and the Church of Scientology. The action in San Francisco is the latest challenge for the transit system, which has faced criticism after several shootings involving its police officers -- the latest coming last month and resulting in the death of 45-year-old Charles Hill. Demonstrators had planned a rally last Thursday to bring attention to the issue. But BART contended that such a protest during rush hour endangered the safety of commuters and employees. In response, the system said in a statement that ""it temporarily interrupted service at select BART stations as one of many tactics to ensure the safety of everyone on the platform."" The move was made on the same day that British Prime Minister David Cameron proposed a crackdown on social media to quell riots. The statement from Anonymous also touted a new peaceful demonstration that it said would occur at 5 p.m. Monday at the transit system's Civic Center station. ""We sincerely hope that this series of actions will serve as a warning to BART and every public organization in the USA to NOT engage in this sort of dangerous and human rights violating behavior,"" the statement said. In the video statement linked to Anonymous and posted Sunday, a voice urges demonstrators to wear red shirts ""in remembrance of those who have been battered by the BART police"" and bring a camera to record the events. ""We will show the world and BART that we will not stand for these types of actions,"" the voice said. BART issued another alert Sunday advising riders about the possible Monday protest. ""As always, BART's primary mission is to ensure your safety and keep trains on-time,"" said a statement on the system's website. ""BART may need to close some stations temporarily or make other service adjustments on short notice.""

"Simply sitting on his couch is painful.  The walker next to Roy Middleton is the constant reminder that he is a long way from being healed. ""How do I feel about what happened?"" he said. ""How would anybody feel getting shot?"" Still visibly angry, Roy Middleton, 60, sat down with CNN for his first television interview since sheriff's deputies mistook him for a car thief and shot at him 15 times in his driveway, outside his own car. He may be the luckiest man you've read about in a long time.  Why?  Because, somehow, 13 of those bullets managed to miss him. The Florida man's leg was shattered and is now being held together by metal rods. ""I ask myself why they shot me first. And why they shoot me so many times afterwards. Yeah, I ask why -- that's all I can ask is why,"" he told CNN. Escambia County sheriff's deputies were responding to a neighbor's 911 call when they arrived in Middleton's Pensacola neighborhood early in the morning on July 27. Middleton said he had had a couple of beers earlier and had just come home from a friend's house. He said he was sober. He was in his car in his driveway but was mistaken for a car thief by his neighbor. Escambia County sheriff's Deputy Jeremiah Meeks and Sgt. Matthew White walked up his driveway.  According to Sheriff David Morgan, Middleton did not respond to their commands and kept going into and out of the car.  With his car keys, which had a small gold flashlight on them, in his hand, Middleton allegedly lunged at the deputies.  He was unarmed. ""The point to making the comments about the lunging was his herky-jerky movements that he was making.  And again, a failure to follow the deputies' instructions,"" Morgan said. That's when Meeks and White opened fire. They have been placed on paid administrative leave while the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigates the case. They will send their findings to the Escambia County state's attorney's office, which will determine whether any charges will be filed against them. ""There was nothing glaringly apparent to us that the officers did that was out of the ordinary in the given set of circumstances as have been given to us,"" Morgan said in an interview with CNN. But Middleton says the deputies were not doing their job. ""They should have asked me, did I live here? Ran my address or license plate or something,"" he said. When asked to respond to Middleton's comment, Morgan said, ""How long has Mr. Middleton been a law enforcement officer? It's a car burglary in progress.  You don't roll up behind the car, expose yourself or your partner and wait for the tag to come back. The officers get out of the car ... respond to the suspect.  At this time Mr. Middleton was a suspect at that time."" Middleton is beginning the legal process to pursue a civil suit against the sheriff's office for excessive force.  He's represented by Lorenzo Williams. ""Roy has been permanently injured. No question about it,"" Williams said. ""If we cannot resolve it through peaceful negotiation, then we have no other choice but to let the court of law evaluate their conduct."" But even Middleton is unsure what restitution would be sufficient or if an apology would suffice. ""I don't know what you call enough,"" he said.  ""If it would make me walk again, yeah.""","""I ask myself why they shot me first,"" Roy Middleton tells CNN in an exclusive interview .

"A storied former U.S. Navy aircraft carrier is on its final voyage Friday, a slow journey from Rhode Island to a scrapyard in Texas. The former USS Saratoga (CV-60), a part of the Navy's carrier fleet from 1956 to 1994, is being towed down the Atlantic Seaboard by tugboat at about 7 mph, according to a report from the Maritime Executive. The voyage is expected to take about 16 days, the Navy says. The Navy in May announced it was paying ESCO Marine of Brownsville, Texas, one cent to take the carrier off its hands for dismantling and recycling. The company makes money by selling the metal it salvages from the ship. Saratoga veterans were among the crowds of people who gathered on Narragansett Bay on Thursday as the ship left Naval Station Newport on its final journey. ""A ship like this shouldn't be taken apart piece by piece,"" Mitchell Abood, who served aboard the Saratoga from 1985 to 1987, said in an article from the U.S. Naval War College. ""It's sad that she could not be turned into a museum,"" former crewman Darryl Fern was quoted as saying. He served aboard the ship from 1982 to 1984. During its more than 38 years in the Navy, the Saratoga went on 22 deployments, including serving off North Vietnam in 1972 and 1973. In 1985, fighters from the Saratoga helped capture terrorists who hijacked the cruise ship Achille Lauro in the Mediterranean, forcing a jetliner carrying them to land at an air base in Sicily. The carrier was also part of Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and air operations over the Balkans in 1992, 1993 and 1994, according to Navy records. The ship carried all kinds of aircraft during its 38 years, but its final voyage had to wait for the departure of some other ""fliers,"" according to the War College report: While it was docked in Rhode Island, a pair of peregrine falcons had chicks in a nest aboard the carrier. ""After consultation with the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife, any movement plans were put on hold until after Aug. 15 to be certain that any fledglings would have ample time to learn to fly and move elsewhere,"" according to the report. The Saratoga follows the former USS Forrestal to dismantling in Texas. That ship was towed to All Star Metals of Brownsville earlier this year, with the Navy paying a penny to the ship recycler under a contract awarded last October.","Former USS Saratoga heads to scrapyard .

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- U.S. presidential contender Barack Obama used a speech Thursday in Berlin --  the German city that once symbolized Cold War division --- to warn about the dangers of allowing new walls to come between the United States and its allies. Barack Obama presses the flesh in Germany after his speech in Berlin's Tiergarten Park. Obama highlighted what he sees as common transatlantic goals while also accepting the differences of the Bush years. He is on the latest leg of an international trip intended to bolster his foreign policy credentials at home and set out his vision for a new era of transatlantic cooperation. In an echo of former President Ronald Reagan's speech when he demanded the Berlin Wall be pulled down, Obama said: ""The walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand. The walls between races and tribes; natives and immigrants; Christian and Muslim and Jew cannot stand. These now are the walls we must tear down."" Obama introduced himself to the Berlin crowd as a proud U.S. citizen and a ""fellow citizen of the world."" He said: ""This city, of all cities, knows the dream of freedom. And you know that the only reason we stand here tonight is because men and women from both of our nations came together to work, and struggle, and sacrifice for that better life.""  Watch Obama in Germany » . He touched on issues that have generally divided Europe and the U.S. such as climate change as well as comparing Berlin's Cold War struggle with today's international challenges like fighting terrorism. ""People of the world - look at Berlin, where a wall came down, a continent came together, and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one,"" he said. Obama said: ""While the 20th century taught us that we share a common destiny, the 21st has revealed a world more intertwined than at any time in human history."" He said the fall of the Berlin Wall offered hope as the world faces up to international challenges such as terrorism, climate change and loose nukes . ""In this new world, such dangerous currents have swept along faster than our efforts to contain them. That is why we cannot afford to be divided,"" Obama said. He also addressed differences between the U.S. and Europe but added: ""In Europe, the view that America is part of what has gone wrong in our world, rather than a force to help make it right, has become all too common. ""In America, there are voices that deride and deny the importance of Europe's role in our security and our future. Both views miss the truth... ""In this new century, Americans and Europeans alike will be required to do more - not less. Partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice; it is the one way, the only way, to protect our common security and advance our common humanity."" Turning to global warming, Obama said: ""This is the moment when we must come together to save this planet. ""Let us resolve that we will not leave our children a world where the oceans rise and famine spreads and terrible storms devastate our lands. Let us resolve that all nations - including my own - will act with the same seriousness of purpose as has your nation, and reduce the carbon we send into our atmosphere."" CNN's Christiane Amanpour said despite the pro-Obama crowd who gathered at the Victory Column in Berlin's Tiergarten Park hours before the speech, many had serious questions about his policies. Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for Obama's Republican rival John McCain, said: ""John McCain has dedicated his life to serving, improving and protecting America. Barack Obama spent an afternoon talking about it."" Obama earlier played down suggestions he was delivering a campaign speech but conceded that his performance was intended as much for an American audience as for the gathering German crowds. He had originally hoped to speak in front of the iconic Brandenburg Gate, where U.S. President John F. Kennedy was photographed during a visit in 1963 shortly after the Berlin Wall had been built. Expressing solidarity with the people of the divided city during the same trip, Kennedy declared ""Ich bin ein Berliner."" The gate was also the site of a speech by U.S. President Ronald Reagan in 1987 in which he memorably urged Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to ""tear down"" the wall. But use of the landmark was apparently vetoed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who a spokesman Wednesday said disapproved of plans to co-opt it as a ""campaign backdrop."" CNN European Political Editor Robin Oakley said Obama enjoyed widespread popularity in Europe, partly because of his optimism and partly because he is not President George W. Bush.  Watch how Europe compares the two candidates » . But Oakley said Obama needed to prove to Americans that he could defend U.S. interests abroad. Republican rival John McCain's campaign team has frequently criticized Obama as being inexperienced on foreign policy and a recent poll suggested just 48 percent of Americans thought he would make a good commander in chief, compared to 72 percent for McCain. Germany's ties with the Bush administration have warmed since a fallout over the Iraq war, which Germany opposed. Germany and the U.S. have also disagreed over NATO member Germany's refusal to send troops into combat zones in southern Afghanistan. Oakley said European leaders would be seeking confirmation that Obama, if elected, would be a ""listening president."" In addition to Merkel, Obama is slated to meet with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and opposition leader David Cameron as well as French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Obama's arrival in Europe follows earlier stopovers in Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Israel and the Palestinian territories. He says he is making the trip as a U.S. senator rather than a presidential contender.","U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama gives speech in Germany .

"A fisherman convicted of throwing evidence of an illegal catch overboard received strong support from the Supreme Court Wednesday, with a number of justices dramatically calling the criminal prosecution a case of government overreach. Federal prosecutors used a law typically applied to corporate records to convict commercial angler John Yates of getting rid of three illegally caught grouper. The question is whether the congressional law against obstructing an investigation into business practices is too vague. It was passed in the aftermath of Enron and other big accounting scandals of that kind. An especially spirited hour of oral arguments had the high court wondering whether the Obama administration went too far in going after a ""little fish"" like Yates. ""He could have gotten 20 years,"" thundered Justice Antonin Scalia, visibly concerned. ""What kind of a sensible prosecution is that?"" But Justice Elena Kagan suggested, ""The fact that this is about any matter within the jurisdiction of any agency in the United States shows that it's really not just about corporate fraud, that Congress had a broader set of things in mind,"" which she said ""suggests breadth."" Retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was among those attending the public session in the courtroom, where all parties smartly avoided using any bad fish-related puns. The actual legal language in dispute involves efforts to conceal, cover up, falsify, or make a false entry in any record, document, or ""tangible object."" It is known as the ""shredding provision,"" referring to the destruction of paper and electronic evidence. It applies to ""the investigation or proper administration or any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency"" of the United States. Yates, 62, owns the Miss Katie, a commercial fishing vessel moored near Bradenton, Florida. It was operating in the Gulf of Mexico in 2007 when state officers working with the National Marine Fisheries Service boarded the vessel. Inspectors discovered 72 undersized red grouper and told the skipper to leave his catch there and head back to shore so agents could seize it. When the Miss Katie arrived at port days later, Yates says a government inspector counted only 69 fish that were below the 20-inch minimum harvesting size. The captain still claims the deputy originally miscounted the fish. Prosecutors alleged Yates had ordered his crew to throw the smaller fish overboard, and charged him with destruction of evidence to impede a federal investigation. A jury eventually convicted the Holmes Beach man and he spent 30 days in federal prison, avoiding a possible two-decade sentence. The Justice Department said Yates does not dispute now that he ""directed the destruction or concealment of the fish"" and officials will argue that the law used to prosecute him does apply, since it ""encompasses all physical evidence"" that might be deliberately tampered or destroyed. In the broader sense, the Obama administration says the so-called 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley law has widely been used to go after obstruction of justice, including ""human bodies, bloodstains, guns, drugs, cars, and automobiles -- in order to cover up offenses ranging from terrorism and the unreasonable use of lethal police force, to violations of environmental and workplace-safety laws."" Yates says the conviction has hurt him economically and wonders why the government was so insistent they ""have a pound flesh"" by prosecuting him for what he called a simple civil infraction. His lawyer, a federal public defender named John Badalamenti, warned the bench that ""the breadth of the statute regarding any federal matter is an extraordinary thing that the American people will be walking on eggshells for if this court were to not limit."" That met some mild resistance from some on the bench, who offered various hypotheticals about which ""tangible objects"" could be used to prosecute for obstruction. Would a typewriter, portable electronic device, or a knife with the owner's name inscribed be included? ""I understand the argument that you make has considerable force about over criminalizing, but it seems to me that the test you suggest has almost more problems with vagueness, more problems with determining what its boundaries are, than the government's test,"" said Justice Anthony Kennedy. ""What sense does it make to say you can be indicted under (this provision) if you destroy a letter that the victim that you have murdered has sent you, but you can't be indicted under (the provision) if you destroy the murder weapon?"" asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. As another example, ""A letter is shredded. It's a letter from the victim to the later-turned-out-to-be murderer. That letter is shredded. Does that come under (the provision)?"" On the other side of the debate, many on the court saved their rhetorical firepower for the Justice Department's lawyer Roman Martinez, who at times struggled to assure the court that the federal government would not prosecute every fish destruction case. ""But the point is that you could, and the point is that once you can, every time you get somebody who is throwing fish overboard, you can go to him and say: Look, if we prosecute you, you're facing 20 years, so why don't you plead to a year, or something like that,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts. ""It's an extraordinary leverage that the broadest interpretation of this statute would give federal prosecutors."" Justice Stephen Breyer cautioned that if a line couldn't be drawn, ""it seems to me that the risk of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is a real one."" Justice Samuel Alito said the government was ""asking the court to swallow something that is pretty hard to swallow. ""Do you deny that this statute, as you read it, is capable of being applied to really trivial matters, and yet each of those would carry a potential penalty of 20 years, and then you go further and say that it is the policy of the Justice Department that this has to be applied in every one of those crazy little cases?"" he asked. ""Perhaps Congress should have called this the Sarbanes-Oxley-Grouper Act,"" Kennedy said, prompting laughter in the courtroom. The justices will not retry the facts -- some of which remain in dispute -- but only will consider whether the law was properly applied. In the coming days, the court will privately vote on the outcome, and a written ruling is expected within the next few months. Several on the bench made reference to a case last term in which the high court unanimously vacated the criminal conviction of a Pennsylvania woman for violating an international treaty on the use of chemical weapons. Carol Ann Bond sought revenge on a romantic rival by sprinkling non-lethal amounts of chemical powders on her onetime friend's mailbox and doorknob. All nine justices said the federal government was overzealous in pursuing what normally would be a simple assault charge handled in state court. In the current dispute, a number of legal and political advocacy groups have rallied to Yates' cause, saying ""misuse"" of government discretion to use criminal law rather than civil law to handle a range of regulatory enforcement is hurting the justice system. The case is Yates v. U.S. (13-7451).","John Yates was convicted of destroying evidence in a federal investigation .

"MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- Alicia Babatz was on her way to pick up her 2-year-old daughter Wednesday when she felt the bridge give way beneath her. Alicia Babatz, 22, was in her car as it plunged into the Mississippi River. Her seatbelt left her bruised. She said she thought she was going to die as her car crashed into the concrete and plunged into the water. Buckled in behind the wheel, she watched the water rise above her. ""I thought that for sure I was going to drown. I thought I was going to sink with my car,"" she said from her hospital bed Friday, her left shoulder bearing the bruised imprint of a seatbelt. Fighting what she called ""excruciating pain,"" Babatz, 22, escaped through a window and swam to the rubble of the collapsed bridge. ""I was crying for help, but there were cries for help all around me,"" she said. It took Babatz about 30 minutes to get out of the water. She said she looked back, and her car was gone. ""It's still hard for me to believe that I took that fall, I went through all that ... but I'm here, and that, to me, is just amazing,"" she said.  Watch Babatz describe her harrowing experience » . Survivor Lori Patterson also witnessed the Interstate 35W bridge collapse -- she was jogging under it moments before it crumbled. Patterson said she heard a loud explosion and turned around, thinking it was construction or dynamite testing. ""It was eerily still and quiet. Like a movie set,"" she wrote in an e-mail she sent to friends and family letting them know she was not in danger. Patterson said that as she watched the dust settle, she began to realize what had happened. More than 100 people were injured Wednesday when the Interstate 35W bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River. Five people are confirmed to have died, but the toll is expected to rise as the underwater recovery effort goes on. As divers searched the murky waters Friday, there was relief when one woman feared missing was found alive and well, the Hennepin County sheriff said. The woman's car was found at the disaster site, but she was not. Investigators tracked her down Friday morning at her workplace, Sheriff Rich Stanek said. However, Stanek would not say how many people are still missing. Stanek had said Friday morning eight people were unaccounted for, but said later: ""We're not convinced only eight are missing."" Minneapolis Police Department spokeswoman Ameilia Huffman had previously told CNN the sheriff's count was ""speculative,"" and Police Chief Tim Dolan had estimated 20 to 30 people remained missing. Four bodies were recovered Wednesday and one was recovered Thursday, Hennepin County Sheriff's Capt. Bill Chandler said at a Friday morning news briefing. The Minneapolis Fire Department recovered the fifth body from the bridge decking, he said.  See photos of the disaster » . At least 100 people have come to hospitals with injuries, said Dr. John Hick of the Hennepin County Medical Center. Authorities reported Thursday that at least 79 people were injured. The number went up because some people waited before going to hospitals complaining of ailments from the collapse -- which is expected, once the adrenaline and initial shock from the experience wear off, Hick said. Friday morning's recovery effort went more smoothly than anticipated, Stanek said. Four submerged vehicles were checked and found to contain no victims, he said. A fifth was not checked because another car is on top of it; heavy equipment would eventually be brought in, he said. Chandler said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had adjusted a nearby dam to drop the river's water level by 2 feet and was regulating the current to make it easier on the divers, whom Chandler directs. Stanek said National Transportation Safety Board investigators had told him that 60 vehicles were visible at the collapse site. The five people confirmed dead were all identified by Friday evening. They were Sherry Lou Engebretsen, 60, of Shoreview, Minnesota; Julia Blackhawk, 32, of Savage, Minnesota; Patrick Holmes, 36, of Mounds View, Minnesota; Artemio Trinidad-Mena, 29, of Minneapolis; and Paul Eickstadt, 51, of Moundsview, Minnesota. Stanek said he has visited three times with missing people's family members at a nearby Holiday Inn. ""When you go over there, it's quite heart-wrenching,"" he said Friday morning. ""These people just want some information. They have hope that something will come."" First lady Laura Bush visited the site Friday. ""I'm so sorry,"" she said upon meeting Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak and other officials. ""If there's anything good about it, maybe we can look at other bridges."" She greeted and thanked police officers, firefighters and Red Cross volunteers. ""God bless you all,"" she said. President Bush, who on Thursday pledged federal aid to rebuild the bridge, will visit the disaster site Saturday. The disaster prompted U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters on Thursday to urge all states to immediately inspect all bridges of the same design. There are about 750 of them across the United States, according to Brian Turmail, a spokesman for the Transportation Department. (See the bridges in need of immediate inspection) Peters on Friday ordered the Federal Highway Administration to offer federal help -- mostly likely in form of engineers -- to all 50 states to complete the inspections.

"The United States and Iran may be bombing a common enemy in Iraq, one whom they both despise -- ISIS. Recent media reports from the region claim Iran's military conducted air raids in eastern Iraq, and on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Pentagon said the reports might be true. ""We have indications that they (Iranians) have flown these missions in recent days, these airstrikes in eastern Iraq,"" Rear Admiral John Kirby told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. No coordination, U.S. says . Is Iran coordinating with the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Sunni Islamist extremists? Adamantly, no, came the answer from both sides. The U.S. is not working with Iran's military, and it is not even directly communicating with it over operations in the country, Kirby said. ""We are not coordinating with nor are we deconflicting with Iranian military,"" he said. Both sides are leaving it to Iraq to manage their movements in Iraqi airspace and keep them both out of each other's hair. Speaking from Brussels, Belgium, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry didn't confirm or deny Iran's military action, saying that's up to the Iraqi or Iranian government. But he did say that while the United States is coordinating its military action with Iraqi authorities, ""nothing has changed"" as far as its lack of coordination with Iran. ""I think it's self-evident that if Iran is taking (action against ISIS) in some particular place, and it's confined to taking on (ISIS) and it has an impact, it's going to be a net effect that is positive,"" Kerry said. ""But it's not something we're coordinating."" Iran blames U.S. for regional unrest . A high-ranking Iranian military official also vehemently rejected the notion that there may have been any coordinated bombing, and he attacked the United States in his comments. ""The Islamic Republic of Iran blames the United States as the root cause of unrests and problems as well as the terrorist actions of ISIL in Iraq,"" Gen. Massoud Jazayeri told the government-approved FARS News Agency, adding that Iran wants U.S. influence to completely evaporate. In another FARS report, the head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard characterized the United States as an enemy, not an ally. ""Today, the Americans are in a strategic dead-end and have experienced all possible options and strategies against the Islamic Revolution, but couldn't attain their desired goals,"" Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari said. ""The U.S. capabilities can no more be expanded and their capacities for initiating a change have reached the level of saturation, meaning that the U.S. is left with no more option but admitting the Islamic Republic of Iran's real power."" A common enemy . Yet ISIS is one of few issues that Iran and the United States agree on; both countries want to quash the terror group that has been taking over large swaths of Iraq and Syria. But with no diplomatic relations with Iran and lingering concerns about its nuclear program, the United States has had to walk a tightrope over Iran's involvement. This was reflected in comments that U.S. President Barack Obama made to CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""There is some deconflicting, in the sense that since they have some troops or militias they control in and around Baghdad ... we let them know, 'Don't mess with us. We're not here to mess with you.' We're focused on our common enemy,"" Obama said. Iranians defend Baghdad? Word of Iranian participation in the fight against ISIS is nothing new. A military official in Iran has said the world can thank his country that ISIS has not been able to assault Baghdad. ""The (ISIS) terrorists sought to surround Baghdad, but they failed in reaching their ominous goals thanks to Iran's supports,"" Brig. Gen. Esmayeel Qa'ani told FARS. Qa'ani is lieutenant commander of the Quds Force, an elite unit of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. According to FARS, senior military officials in Baghdad said the Quds Force helped free the Iraqi town of Jurf al-Sakher from ISIS control. Conflicting interests . But the common interest is complicated by diverging interests. The United States wants to put an end to all Islamist extremism, and in the past, it has accused Tehran of sponsoring terrorism. Iran itself is an Islamic republic, governed by stringent Islamic law. But the state religion is Shia Islam, which Sunni Muslim extremists, such as ISIS, consider heresy. Fear of religious tensions . In neighboring Iraq, there is a tense and at times violent schism between Shia and Sunni factions, with the former dominating in government. Iran has close ties to the Shia faction. That has stirred fears in Washington that Iran's involvement could not only weaken ISIS, but could also drive the wedge between Iraqis deeper. ""We want nothing to be done that further inflames sectarian tensions in the country,"" Kirby said of Iranian military actions. Iran is also a close ally of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who is battling ISIS as well. Beating back ISIS would take some pressure off of his troops. The United States is calling for al-Assad's removal.","U.S. secretary of state says Iranian actions against ISIS could have a positive effect .

"Paris (CNN) -- A former fashion model who posed in a provocative ad campaigning against anorexia has died in France, her acting teacher said. Isabelle Caro, who was widely reported to be 28 years old, gained attention when she posed nude for the 2007 ad, which was featured on a billboard.  The huge photo shows her gaunt body, with her back to the camera and her ribs visible, above the words ""No Anorexia."" News of her death was reported in European news outlets on Wednesday and Thursday, but Caro died last month, her acting teacher, Daniele Gouzard-Dubreuil Prevot, said. She said she did not know how Caro died and said Caro's father told her that Caro died on November 17 and was buried on November 24. Vincent Bigler, a Swiss singer, said he received an e-mail from Caro in September. ""Isabelle told me she had been hospitalized for 15 days with acute respiratory disease,"" he said. He has not spoken with Caro's family and said he learned of her death through Facebook and from mutual friends. Caro's agent, Sylvie Fabregon, said she learned of Caro's death through the news media. In 2008, Caro released an autobiography called ""The Little Girl Who Did Not Want to Get Fat.""  In it, she described the debut of her disease when she was 12, and talked about her battle against death, according to a summary of the book on the publisher's website.  She also denounced the ""Pro-Ana"" movement, whose supporters claim that anorexia is not a disease but a choice and a lifestyle. On what appears to be Caro's Facebook page, listed under ""Philosophy"" are the words ""the best is yet to come."" In the introduction of her blog, which she called ""Anorexia or the hunger to live, take a step toward healing,"" Caro appeared to describe herself as ""a little invisible snowflake in a strong blizzard who is fighting, fighting to finally live, despite years of suffering, and who is crying out to the entire world to say that anorexia is a hell from which you must escape while you still have time.""","Isabelle Caro's emaciated image called attention to anorexia in 2007 .

They have supported my agenda in Congress,"" Obama said on Al Sharpton's radio show Monday, ticking off measures like a minimum wage increase, equal pay, investments in infrastructure and early childhood education. ""So, this isn't about my feelings being hurt,"" he said. ""These are folks who are strong allies and supporters of me. And I tell them, I said, 'You know what, you do what you need to win. I will be responsible for making sure that our voters turn up.'"" His comments were similar to ones he made at Northwestern University earlier this month -- which Republicans immediately plugged into campaign ads. Those comments, former White House adviser David Axelrod said, were a political mistake. Obama's remarks could harm endangered red-state Democrats and offer a boost to Republicans who need to capture six seats to gain control of the Senate for the President's final two years in office.","Obama says ""these are all folks who vote with me""

"Turns out you can do a lot of really smart things, as long as you're clueless. At Not Impossible Labs, we've already created a device to let a paralyzed painter create his art, using just the movement of his eyes. We made it to the Sudan and printed a new arm on a 3D printer for a teenaged boy whose arms were blown off in the war -- and he fed himself for the first time in two years. And pretty soon, we'll have a device that will allow patients suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease to type on a computer -- just by thinking. We didn't have any fancy labs for any of this, or gigantic budgets. We didn't go through insurance companies or medical labs. We made all of these devices for maybe a couple hundred bucks apiece -- some for much less. (the Brainwriter, as we're calling it, includes a homemade EEG device based on a prototype that a couple of our team members fashioned out of some electrodes, two nine-volt batteries, and an old sock, in their kitchen, at 2 in the morning. I wasn't there, but I'm told there was some whiskey involved as well). In each case, the experts told us that what we were doing just couldn't be done. Fortunately, we didn't listen, or didn't hear them, or ignored them, or were oblivious, or all of the above. We went ahead and tried anyway. And what do you know. It worked. This all started when I met a graffiti artist named Tempt, who was paralyzed with ALS. I was a film producer, with no experience whatsoever in the field of technological medical devices. But when I learned how he was communicating with his family -- they'd run their fingers over a piece of paper with the alphabet printed on it, he'd blink when they'd get to the letter he wanted, and, painstakingly, he'd spell out a sentence -- I was moved, and angry, and a whole lot of other things. And I blurted out to his father, ""We will find a way to get Tempt to paint again."" See, I was just clueless enough not to know that that was impossible. Funny how that works. So we got a bunch of crazy hackers together, and Tempt's plight gave way to the Eyewriter: a device that tracked his eye movements, translated that to a cursor, and allowed him to create drawings. It was a beautiful thing to see. And a beautiful beginning. At one point, a group of programmers and coders told us, ""If you had any clue how hard it is to do what you did, you never would have tried it in the first place."" I'm so glad we were clueless. What happened with Tempt gave way to the Not Impossible Labs, a foundation and company with a simple idea. We'll create these devices with whatever we can -- coat hangers, duct tape, chewing gum. Essential to the process is what's called ""open source""  -- we give everything away, for free. We post the design on the Web and hope other people will pick it up and improve it. That's just what happened with the Eyewriter: A Samsung engineering team in South Korea saw the device and made a better one. Now Samsung, working with a  government agency, is providing hundreds of those to ALS patients. And they've ""open-sourced"" their design as well -- so now anyone can make one, for around 50 bucks. We starting thinking about what we were doing as the Revolution Against the Absurd. Anyone who has tried to get a medical device for a loved one, and had to negotiate the maze that's created by the provider, the hospital, the lawyers, the insurance companies, knows just how absurd it can be. It's absurd that in this day and age, an ALS patient would have to communicate with his parents by watching them run their fingers over a piece of paper. It's like seeing someone rubbing two sticks together, and thinking, hey, someone should invent a match for these people. So that's what we're doing. We're down in the basement, inventing matches. Everyone told me I was crazy to go to the Sudan -- one of the most dangerous, war-torn areas of the globe -- in search of Daniel, a boy I'd read about whose arms had been blown off by a bomb. Three months later, we'd not only tracked Daniel down and fashioned a new hand for him, but we left the 3D printer and materials behind, and trained a group of locals to make the hands -- which they're cranking out now, for others maimed in the war. Not Impossible just kept growing -- because of passionate, brilliant people who were always willing and able to do good, but just needed a place to point their energy. A guy up in Canada named Javed Gangjee saw a TED talk I gave about the Eyewriter, decided he wanted in, and started devoting all his spare time to taking it one step further. The Eyewriter relies on the patient's ability to blink, as a way to ""click"" the cursor the way you'd click a mouse. But what about patients who can't control their ocular muscles anymore? he asked. Don't they deserve to communicate, too? So he started devoting all his spare time to hooking our Eyewriter device up to an EEG -- a homemade device to register brain activity as a way of clicking a mouse. ""Working in the scientific field, you kind of run into 'yes' people and 'no' people,"" said David Putrino, another member of the Brainwriter team (and the one who came up with the electrodes-and-sock model.) ""There are the scientific people who are the skeptics, who just say there's just no way this can be done. And there are people like me and Javed who say, 'this is totally impossible, but we're just gonna try and do it.'"" David possesses a quality -- as do the other members of the team, Dan Goodwin and Sam Bergen -- that, I think, is essential to success. We call it beautiful naïvete. Because if you're just naïve enough to believe you can do what everybody tells you that you can't, amazing things can happen. It's just possible, in fact, that you'll discover what each of us has discovered: . That nothing, in fact, is impossible.","Ebeling started Not Impossible because ""I hate the word 'no'.""

"The loudspeaker at a nearby mosque warned Ifat Najeeb what was coming. Najeeb, 60, woke to warnings that a flood was imminent in the Gogjibagh region of Srinagar, Kashmir, where she and her husband live. Residents were advised to leave and move to safer areas. ""I woke up suddenly and felt something was wrong,"" Najeeb told CNN. ""Soon there was a thud and our main gate had been flung open by gushing waters which were rising alarmingly."" Moments later, water was pouring into Najeeb's home. ""Within no time our first floor was inundated. We rushed upstairs to the third floor as we watched dreadfully the waters covered the second floor in no time as well,"" Najeeb said. Najeeb and her husband were rescued by authorities, eventually relocating to an unaffected area in uptown Srinagar. They consider themselves lucky. ""Mercifully, the waters did not rise beyond the second floor, otherwise I and my husband would not be alive to tell the story,"" she said. Recent flooding brought by heavy monsoon rains has wrought death and destruction in India and Pakistan since the rains began on September 2. Floods aren't uncommon in Kashmir, but these have been particularly severe in terms of damage and loss of life. Nearly 500 have lost their lives in both countries, officials tell CNN. At least 280 people have been killed in Pakistan and more than 500 others injured, the government there said. And at least 200 people have died in flooding in Indian-administered Kashmir, Indian Home Ministry spokesman Kuldeep Dhatwalia told CNN. Some volunteers in that country fear the toll could be much higher. ""Our teams on the ground in Srinagar have seen a number of bodies floating. The casualty is believed to be much more than what his being officially reported,"" said Syed Zafar Mahmood, president of the nonprofit Zakat Foundation of India group. ""A number of villages have been washed away."" By Saturday, military and other emergency crews were able to rescue more than 276,000 people from parts of the flood-ravaged region under Indian control, according to officials. Home to 12 million people, the state of Jammu and Kashmir is India's 19th most populous province. South Asian monsoon's trail of destruction . Public anger . Indian officials said rescue efforts continued on a massive scale, but refused to confirm reports that hundreds of thousands of people still remained stranded a week after floods wreaked havoc in the Himalayan valley. Public anger has grown over the government response to the disaster in the restive mountain state, beset with decades-old militancy and a center of conflict between archrivals India and Pakistan. TV footage showed frustrated residents shouting slogans and heckling at least one senior Kashmiri politician, who visited a relief camp in Srinagar in the aftermath of the catastrophe. There have also been reports of sporadic attacks against rescuers. Many people are accusing the local government of a failure to deal with the disaster. ""There was a complete breakdown of communication,"" said Sheikh Manzoor Ahmed, a New Delhi-based Kashmiri man whose ancestral house collapsed in Srinagar. ""Hospitals got flooded. There was no one to coordinate locally with rescue teams arriving from other parts of the country. How can they be expected to know the topography of the valley?"" Pakistani military delivers aid . In Pakistan, the flooding has affected more than 2 million people, the government said. The military has blown up dykes in the central part of the country to prevent overflowing rivers from swamping cities, according to the government. Meanwhile, the military is evacuating residents and dropping food by air in the districts of Multan, Muzaffargarh and Jhang, the Pakistani military said. Civilian and military officials have been using helicopters and boats to evacuate marooned people since September 3, the military said. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif visited flood-affected residents in Athara Hazari in Jhang district Saturday, according to his office. Sharif said the federal and provincial governments were working together to help the flood victims, adding that ""this is not a favor, but the responsibility of the government to extend a helping hand to the calamity-hit people.""","Pakistan's government says at least 280 citizens are dead and more than 500 injured .

"Dramatic video of a stunt pilot buzzing a Texas runway -- narrowly missing two people -- has prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to investigate the incident, authorities confirmed Thursday. The video, shot January 16 at Lancaster Municipal Airport south of Dallas, depicts a plane coming in close proximity to two people in an apparently staged stunt. The pilot, identified as Jason Newburg, previously had an FAA waiver to do aerobatics at the airport, but the waiver expired in November, an FAA source -- who requested anonymity because of the ongoing investigation -- told CNN. FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford said Thursday the agency is investigating the incident. ""Even with a valid waiver, there is a requirement that people on the ground not be endangered,"" he said. The 19-second clip, titled ""200mph Plane fly-by within 2 feet of person,"" was uploaded to YouTube, according to The Smoking Gun, which also posted the video. In a Twitter post, a member of Team Stunters -- a motorcycle stunt team -- reported the footage was shot during a ""practice session for upcoming shows,"" The Smoking Gun reported. The Smoking Gun is owned by Turner Broadcasting, which also owns CNN. A CNN phone call to Newburg was not immediately returned, nor were e-mails to the motorcycle stunt team.","Video shot January 16 near Dallas shows stunt plane narrowly missing two people .

"One South African artist is using the street as his canvas and changing lives in the process. Ricky-Lee Gordon, who goes by his artist name Freddy Sam, describes himself as a creative activist who hopes to bring about social change through his projects. His latest ambition is to transform the Cape Town suburb, Woodstock, with murals full of color and positive messages. He says that business owners are happy for murals to be painted on their buildings because the color is rejuvenating the area. ""The area, the landscape and the architecture is really rundown and neglected so a mural can do a lot for an environment,"" Gordon said. ""Woodstock is I guess the up and coming art precinct. It was a thriving textile and clothing industry and community. A lot of families would move here to get work in these factories, but these factories unfortunately are closing down,"" he continued. Gordon explains that the cheap rent in Woodstock is now attracting artists and galleries to re-locate to the area but it's not the only draw. ""Artists like to be surrounded by real culture, and there's a real culture here. There's a mix of people and it makes for an interesting life on the street,"" he added. 'Traffic light' artists paint a brighter future . Gordon is also getting the community involved. One of the organizations he works with is the Percy Bartley orphanage, a home to boys aged eight to 18 years. ""When I found out about this home, I proposed to the sponsor to give us funding to rejuvenate the home with colors and murals,"" Gordon said. But what began as murals has now turned into a weekly art workshop at the home. Gordon says the boys will soon be opening their own art exhibition. ""It's about using art for upliftment and inspiration, to really remind these boys that they are special,"" he said. Gordon is also hoping to attract more artists to the area. He runs a residency and project space called, Word of Art, where he invites creatives from around the world to come and live in Woodstock and get involved in the community. ""It's a very special situation that we have here for artists to live and work in Woodstock so they just feel free to explore the streets and have a discovery of South Africa, a real personal South African story,"" he said. While it's unclear what the future holds for Woodstock, Gordon says he knows that gentrification is coming and he wants to be part of it. ""I'm not instigating it, I'm not the reason there is gentrification, but I can influence the gentrification for the better, with art, with sensitivity, with communication between communities,"" he said. Until then Gordon plans to continue bringing color and beauty to the run-down suburb. ""The nice thing about public art is, it actually translates into a language and people can be affected by it and respond to it and give their opinion, and usually their opinion is very positive,"" he said. ""We make sure to make work that is sensitive and not offensive in any way, just colorful and vibrant. ""","Street artist, Freddy Sam, hopes to bring about social change through his projects .

"A very public squabble between two top Republican politicians who might be leading contenders for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination has grabbed clicks online and airtime on cable news. The war of words between New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky over national security, civil liberties and federal spending is also a proxy for the bigger battle for the future of the Republican Party. Here are five things we're learning from their spat. 1. The fight for the 2016 GOP nomination is under way . It's only the summer of 2013, but the intensity of the exchanges between Christie and Paul makes it feel like late 2015 in some ways, with the start of the caucus and primary season just weeks away. The back and forth started last week when Christie, at a forum in Colorado with other GOP governors, slammed Paul for his criticism of government surveillance to battle terrorists. ""This strain of libertarianism that's going through parties right now and making big headlines, I think, is a very dangerous thought,"" Christie said. Asked if Paul was one of the people he was pointing toward, Christie added: ""You can name any number of people and he's one of them."" Paul pushed back. ""I'm the one trying to grow the party by talking about libertarian ideas of privacy and the Internet and attacking me isn't helping the party. He's hurting the party,"" Paul said in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room."" Rep. Peter King of New York, who's also considering a run for the White House, also jumped into the fray with comments critical of the libertarian-leaning senator. ""He wants to retreat from the world. He wants to isolate ourselves, go back to a fortress America,"" King told Blitzer on Wednesday. Senate rejects Rand Paul-backed plan to end aid to Egypt . 2. This is far from over . While this round may be finished, others are sure to follow. On Wednesday, Paul made a pitch for the two men to sit down and talk it out, hoping to ease tensions. ""I'm inviting him to a beer -- anytime he would like to come down and sit down at the pub right around the corner from the Senate,"" Paul said in an interview on Fox News, adding that proposed get-together didn't have to be in the nation's capital. ""We could always negotiate a middle ground like Philadelphia maybe,"" said Paul. That didn't seem to fly with the tough-talking governor. ""I'm running for re-election in New Jersey, I don't really have time for that at the moment. If I find myself in Washington, I'll certainly look him up,"" Christie said in a radio interview on New Jersey 101.5. ""But I've got work to do here."" Expect the action to pick up again in the future. ""This is just the beginning. This is not going to stop,"" CNN Chief National Correspondent John King said. GOP strategist and CNN contributor Ana Navarro agreed. ""I think we are going to end up with a Republican primary that looks a lot like a cage match,"" she said. 3. War of words illustrates bigger battle . Sure, this is about 2016, but it's also about a much bigger fight for the future of the GOP. Most Republicans agree: Major changes are needed if the party wants to be competitive in future presidential elections. But a new poll of Republicans nationwide also indicates that there's little agreement on the direction the GOP should take. That's playing out in the fireballs between Christie and Paul: The New Jersey governor represents the more traditional establishment wing of the party, with Paul the standard-bearer for the libertarian and grassroots conservative/tea party wing. With losses in the last two presidential elections still stinging, two-thirds of Republicans questioned in the Pew Research Center poll say that the GOP needs to address major problems to do better in future presidential contests. Three in 10 disagree, saying the party just needs to address minor problems. Along those lines, nearly six in 10 say the party needs to reconsider some positions, with 36% saying the GOP needs to make a stronger case for its current policies. Rep. King: Rand Paul shouldn't be face of GOP . But there's less agreement on what the path the party should take. By 54%-40% margin, Republican and Republican-leaning voters say party leaders should move in a more conservative direction, with four in 10 urging a more moderate direction. ""Not surprisingly, conservatives and those who agree with the tea party overwhelmingly favor moving in a more conservative direction, while moderates and liberals would like to see the party take more centrist positions. Yet the more moderate wing of the party is a minority generally, and makes up an even smaller share of the likely primary electorate,"" Pew said in releasing the poll. King said that ensures a ""spirited debate"" in the months ahead. ""They have to deal with the immigration issue again. They have that ditch with Latino voters. Taxes and spending."" McCain: Tough choice between Clinton and Rand Paul . 4. Chris Christie doesn't pull punches . Yes, we knew this. But this episode reminds us of how blunt Christie can be. While Paul seemed on Wednesday to be trying to bring the scuffle to an end, Christie held his ground. ""At the end of the day, I didn't call him any names, yet he called me names,"" Christie said in his radio interview Wednesday. ""I just have to assume from that that he's just trying to get attention."" Christie was talking about his initial comments that sparked the feud, adding: ""It really had nothing to do with Senator Paul, but Senator Paul wanted to make it about Senator Paul,"" Christie added. Christie speaks his mind, which appeals to voters, and not just Republicans. While Paul has a higher favorable rating among Republicans than Christie, according to the Pew poll, Christie has crossover appeal with Independents and Democrats that Paul can't match. 5. Did Paul go there? Paul accused Christie of harming national security by hoarding federal relief money for Superstorm Sandy victims. Christie responded by calling on Paul to cut federal pork spending in Kentucky. ""But I doubt he would because most Washington politicians only care about bringing home the bacon so that they can get re-elected,"" Christie charged on Tuesday. Paul responded later in the day on ""The Situation Room,"" saying, ""This is the king of bacon talking about bacon."" Was there more to Paul's ""bacon"" comment than just pork spending? Paul advisers say it had nothing to do with Christie's weight, which was an issue when he first ran for governor in 2009. While it's not a problem for Christie as he appears to cruise towards re-election, it will most definitely come up again and again if he opts to run for the White House.","War of words between Rand Paul and Chris Christie reflects division among Republicans .

"When astronaut Neil Armstrong uttered what became one of the best-known -- and most debated -- quotes in all of history, he actually might have said it exactly the way he meant to, not the way people heard it. After Armstrong lowered his left foot from the landing craft to the surface of the moon, people watching around the world heard him call it ""one small step for man."" Both he and NASA initially insisted that he said ""one small step for a man,"" and now a new and novel study on the much-analyzed quote backs him up. Researchers from Michigan State University and Ohio State University have ""bolstered Neil Armstrong's side of the story,"" said Laura Dilley, an MSU assistant professor of communicative sciences and disorders. After becoming the first person to step on the moon in 1969, Armstrong said what was heard as: ""That's one small step for man; one giant leap for mankind."" You can hear the audio here. Later, as NASA explains, Armstrong said he had intended to say ""a man,"" and thought he had.  But he agreed that ""a"" did not seem audible in the recording. Numerous intense studies have been carried out over the years, using high-tech equipment, all in the effort to discover whether he had indeed uttered that one little sound. In 2006, Peter Shann Ford said he had found the ""a"" in a study of the audio waveform, NASA explains.  Then, ""more rigorous analyses of the transmission were undertaken by people with professional experience with audio waveforms and, most importantly, audio spectrograms.  None of these analyses support Ford's conclusion."" First man on the moon gave rare interview . Until now, perhaps. The MSU and OSU researchers took what they call a novel approach: studying how people from Armstrong's native central Ohio pronounce ""for"" and ""for a."" The team studied recordings of 40 people in Columbus, near Armstrong's native town of Wapakoneta.  They found numerous examples of ""for"" and ""for a"" sounding similar. Their results suggest that it is entirely possible that Armstrong said what he claimed, though evidence indicates that people are statistically more likely to hear 'for man' instead of 'for a man' on the recording,"" Michigan State University said in a news release. ""We feel we've partially vindicated him,"" Dilley said.  ""But we'll most likely never know for sure exactly what he said.""

"For the 160-plus inmates at the U.S. prison camp here, each sunrise brings a new day that most would rather starve than endure. For the American troops who guard them, each day brings a daily rain of obscenities and filth -- sometimes physical as well as verbal. More than a decade after the first inmates arrived at the U.S. base where prisoners from the U.S. war on terror are being held, Guantanamo Bay is a facility in crisis. From the 700-plus detainees it once held, only 166 remain. Of those, more than half have been approved for transfers out, but languish as the Obama administration and Congress battle over whether to shut down the facility. A handful are facing trial before military commissions, a process that has been criticized as both inefficient and unfair. ""The commissions are a joke,"" inmate Muhammad Rahim al-Afghani wrote to his lawyer in March. ""If you lose you go to prison for life. If you win, you're held indefinately (sic) for life."" Al-Afghani has been held in Guantanamo since 2008, transferred there after being held by the CIA. The Pentagon said he was one of al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden's ""most trusted facilitators and procurement specialists."" More than half are on hunger strikes. Some will take liquid nutritional supplements, but about 30 are being force-fed -- a practice condemned by human rights groups and the American Medical Association. The military has brought in additional medical staff to manage the protest. Opinion: Stop force feeding inmates . Most of the inmates have been moved to two blocks, dubbed Camp V and Camp VI. For the most part, they look like a typical civilian prison, with two tiers of cells that face out onto a room full of metal tables. The air conditioning delivers a chilly blast when walking in from the muggy tropical air outside. The detainees used to be allowed to live communally, but that ended after a raid turned up homemade weapons. Now they're held in individual cells with heavy steel doors. They're allowed to watch movies and even some news programs in recliners in media rooms -- with their feet shackled to the floor. They're guarded by Americans, some of them not yet old enough to drink, who face a daily torrent of abuse. ""They use extremely vulgar language towards females, and I've had a lot of experience with that, unfortunately,"" said one young woman who serves as a guard there. ""Especially Caucasian females -- they do not like us at all."" The military would not allow her to be identified, and even her nametag displayed only a number. But she says she's 21 and has already served a tour as a guard at the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In Guantanamo, the prisoners call her a bitch. A whore. A slut. But worse than the name-calling is what the guards call ""splashing"" -- flinging urine or feces on the guards. It happens to someone ""every single day"" for the last month and a half, she said. ""They'll say things like, 'I'll piss all over your face,' "" she said. ""They'll say, Oh, you've had shit thrown on you, been disrespected,' or 'Nobody wants you, you're trash now.' "" The cell doors have what are called ""splash boxes"" through which food is passed. They're designed to minimize contact with inmates and reduce splashing, but they don't eliminate it. The walls and floors are quickly scrubbed down, but bits of feces are still visible stuck to the foam ceiling tiles in the units. The young guard said those ""splashed"" -- and she's been among them -- are sent to the camp hospital, notified of any diseases their assailant may carry, have their blood tested -- ""and then you go right back to work."" The prison camp opened in 2002. President Barack Obama came into office vowing to close the prison camp, and told reporters in April that he still wants to shut it down. Opinion: Terror threat from Gitmo prisoners is exaggerated . ""I think it is critical for us to understand that Guantanamo is not necessary to keep America safe,"" he told reporters in a White House news conference. ""It is expensive. It is inefficient. It hurts us, in terms of our international standing. It lessens cooperation with our allies on counterterrorism efforts. It is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed."" But Congress has forbidden the administration from moving the detainees to prisons stateside. The administration halted transfers of 56 inmates from Yemen in 2010 because of what Obama called the ""unsettled situation"" in that country, an al Qaeda hotbed. A handful of the detainees have faced trial before military commissions. Cases are pending against a number of others, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-professed organizer of the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. But they're progressing at a glacial pace, while some low-ranking inmates who pleaded guilty have been returned to their home countries. ""It's a bizarre, perverted system of justice where being convicted of a war crime is your ticket home,"" former Air Force Col. Morris Davis, once the chief prosecutor at Guantanamo Bay, told CNN's ""Amanpour"" program Tuesday. ""And if you're never charged, much less convicted, you spend the rest of your life sitting at Guantanamo."" Davis quit his post in 2007, declaring that the prosecutions of several suspected terrorists had become ""deeply politicized."" The frozen status of the detainees has fueled the hunger strikes, which grew from about a half-dozen inmates at first to more than 100 now. ""This is kind of the only option they have left, to say, 'Hey, we're still here. We are still your problem. Are you just gonna let us rot in here until the end of time?' "" said Cori Crider, a lawyer who represents several detainees. About 30 of them refuse to take even liquid nutritional drinks and have to be fed through tubes shoved down their noses. The American Medical Association has criticized the practice, calling it a violation of the profession's core ethics. ""Every competent patient has the right to refuse medical intervention, including life-sustaining interventions,"" AMA President Jeremy Lazarus wrote in an April letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. The Pentagon says the feeding program is lawful and humane. But Capt. Robert Durand, a spokesman for the detention facility, acknowledges that the options for the administrators are dwindling. ""If anybody's had a can of Ensure or Muscle Milk, it says right on it it's not designed to be a long-term, sole source of nutrition,"" Durand said. ""So there are long-term consequences of getting all your meals through a liquid supplement.""","More than half the 166 detainees are on hunger strikes .

"The Obama administration says it will seek $500 million from Congress to help ""train and equip appropriately vetted elements of the moderate Syrian armed opposition,"" funding that, if approved, would deepen U.S. involvement in that country's civil war. National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden announced on Thursday that the administration would seek the money that she said would build on ""longstanding efforts"" by the United States ""to empower the moderate Syrian opposition."" ""These funds would help defend the Syrian people, stabilize areas under opposition control, facilitate the provision of essential services, counter terrorist threats, and promote conditions for a negotiated settlement,"" she said. The $500 million request would be part of a $1.5 billion so-called regional stabilization initiative, which would involve partnering with Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq -- Syria's neighbors. Funding elements of the Syrian opposition would be significant, though it wouldn't necessarily be surprising. In fact, the U.S. government has been in close contact with some leading the fight to topple President Bashar al-Assad. Last summer, Congress approved some military support for Syrian rebels, and there's been more back-and-forth since then. Still, any such support is complicated by the fact that the United States doesn't see eye to eye with -- and doesn't want to arm or help in any way -- some elements of the Syrian opposition. That includes the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIS or ISIL, a group whose tactics have been so brutal that they've even been disowned by al Qaeda. ISIS, which hopes to establish an Islamic caliphate in the region, is currently making news for taking over a wide swath of Iraq and threatening Baghdad. Nonetheless, the Obama administration hasn't backed away from other rebels -- seeing them as the best bet, compared to Syria's current government and certain militant fighters. ""While we continue to believe that there is no military solution to this crisis and that the United States should not put American troops into combat in Syria, this request marks another step toward helping the Syrian people defend themselves against regime attacks, push back against the growing number of extremists like ISIL who find safe-haven in the chaos, and take their future into their own hands by enhancing security and stability at local levels,"" spokeswoman Hayden said. In May, the President told graduating cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point that he would ""work with Congress to ramp up support for those in the Syrian opposition who offer the best alternative to terrorists and a brutal dictator.""","The $500 million request is part of a $1.5 billion regional stabilization initiative .

"The symptoms of gastroenteritis aren't pretty, but at least doctors know what's behind the wave of cases in recent years. According to a new study released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, norovirus sent nearly 1 million children under age five in the U.S. to the doctor or hospital in 2009 and 2010. And treating those youngsters cost an estimated $273 million a year. Norovirus is often called the ""stomach flu"" or ""food poisoning"" since its symptoms include severe vomiting and diarrhea. According to the CDC, the virus, which inflames the lining of the stomach and intestines, causes 21 million cases of illness, 70,000 hospitalizations and 800 deaths in the U.S. annually. A little more than half of the cases are passed from person to person, and 20% are caused by contaminated food. Based on their latest findings, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers said an estimated 1 in 278 kids will be hospitalized for norovirus infection by the time they turn five, about 1 in 14 will visit an emergency room and 1 in 6 will receive out patient treatment. TIME.com: New strain of norovirus is circulating . The estimates came from data involving more than 141,000 kids under age five who required medical attention for acute gastroenteritis between October 2008 and September 2010. Lab tests confirmed the presence of the norovirus. The virus was identified in 278 of the 1,295 cases of acute gastroenteritis and rotavirus, which is another cause of gastroenteritis, was identified in only 152. Infants infected with norovirus were more likely to be hospitalized and about 50% of the medical care visits from norovirus infections occurred in kids between six to 18 months. The surge in norovirus cases may be due in part to better control of rotavirus infection, for which children can be vaccinated. ""Our study confirmed that medical visits for rotavirus illness have decreased,"" said Dr. Daniel Payne, an epidemiologist in the division of viral diseases at the CDC in a statement. ""Also, our study reinforces the success of the U.S. rotavirus vaccination program and also emphasizes the value of specific interventions to protect against norovirus illness."" TIME.com: Don't keep your grocery bag in the bathroom . There is no treatment for norovirus, other than bed rest and drinking plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Most people recover between 24 hours to 48 hours. Work on a vaccine to protect against the virus is underway, and in March, when a new strain of norovirus was identified in the U.S., TIME spoke to Dr. John Treanor, chief of the Infectious Diseases Division at the University of Rochester Medical Center who is testing a vaccine developed by LigoCyte Pharmaceuticals: . ""The shot contains a part of the norovirus' outer layer, which they hope will generate a strong immune response in those who get immunized. A vaccine would be critical for preventing the disease from escalating in populations; because it spreads so quickly, norovirus infections are difficult to contain. ""'You really only have to be exposed to a couple of viral particles to get sick,' says Treanor. 'This makes it very contagious because when you have norovirus, you are dispersing literally millions of particles. When it only takes one or two to make the next person sick, it translates into very high contagiousness.'"" TIME.com: Illnesses from imported food on the rise . If successful the vaccine could significantly reduce the number of illnesses associated with the virus, and same millions in health care costs to treat dehydrated children. Until then, the CDC recommends washing your hands regularly, cleaning any infected or contaminated surfaces and laundry and if you or anyone around you is sick, and to wait two to three days after you recover before preparing food for anyone.

"Simferopol, Ukraine (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama and Ukrainian interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk had strong words for Russia on Wednesday as Washington again warned Moscow there will be consequences if it doesn't remove its troops from Crimea and Kiev said that it will ""never surrender."" But Yatsenyuk also said after his meeting with Obama at the White House that Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic, wants to be good friends with Russia. ""We will continue to say to the Russian government that if it continues on the path that is on, then not only us but the international community ... will be forced to apply a cost to Russia's violations of international law,"" Obama told reporters. ""There is another path available, and we hope that (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin is willing seize that path."" Yatsenyuk -- who took over after the ouster of Viktor Yanukovych, the pro-Russian former president of Ukraine -- said that Ukraine is fighting for its freedom. ""We fight for our sovereignty, and we will never surrender,"" he said. Later he added that he wanted to be clear that Ukraine ""is and will be a part of the Western world"" but still a ""good friend and partner of Russia."" At a meeting of an international affairs think tank called the Atlantic Council in Washington, Yatsenyuk further explained. ""We still want to have a free (and) equal partnership with Russia. And you can't do it having a military incursion. We do not consider a military option as the best option on how to fix this crisis,"" he said. Even as the leaders met earlier pro-Russian forces were tightening their grip in Crimea ahead of a secession referendum denounced by the West. Well-armed men have effectively isolated the Crimean peninsula, which has an ethnic Russian majority, from the rest of Ukraine. Tensions flared Wednesday at a Ukrainian military base in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. A CNN team saw Ukrainian forces load and cock their weapons as what appeared to be Russian soldiers moved in on the base and placed a heavy machine gun at the gates. The Russian troops pulled back. Yatsenyuk first met U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry before heading to the White House and later met with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He will go to New York on Thursday to address the United Nations Security Council. The Ukrainian delegation will also meet with Congress, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund while in Washington, in an indication of international support for Ukraine's fledgling government. Yatsenyuk's visit comes as breakneck preparations are under way for a Sunday referendum in Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula -- to be held largely in secret -- and tensions persist around Simferopol, Crimea's capital. Flights to Crimea from Kiev, Istanbul and several other cities have been suspended for the rest of the week, with only those originating from Moscow landing. Crimeans will be able to choose between two alternatives when they vote: Do you support reuniting Crimea with Russia, as a subject of the Russian Federation? Or, do you support the restoration of the 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Crimea and Crimea's status as a part of Ukraine? The Crimean Electoral Commission was delivering referendum ballots to regional administrative buildings, according to the body's head, Michail Malishev. The new pro-Russian government on the peninsula in Ukraine's southeast said Tuesday that if the voters opt to join Russia, the first step will be to declare Crimea an independent and sovereign state. Then it will apply to join the Russian Federation. Crimea's representatives have already approached Moscow with their idea. Russian leaders have greeted them with open arms. Diplomatic pressure . Russian-speaking troops wearing no identifying insignia have Crimea firmly under their control. Many believe that they belong at least in part to Russia's military, an assertion Moscow has repeatedly denied. Russia says they are local ""self-defense"" forces. There has been an international outcry over Crimea's push for separation and warnings that the referendum won't be recognized in Kiev or elsewhere. Efforts to exert diplomatic pressure on Moscow continued Wednesday despite little sign that Russia is listening. Kerry said he would meet Friday in London with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, to continue discussions on the situation in Ukraine. Meanwhile, French President Francois Hollande told Putin, in a phone call that the referendum planned in Crimea ""has no legal basis."" Hollande urged Putin to ""do everything to prevent the annexation of Crimea to Russia,"" saying that such a move would be unacceptable to the international community. In a different tone, a statement from the Kremlin said Putin and Hollande had agreed to continue discussions, and France's foreign and defense ministers would travel to Moscow next week. U.S. military presence . CNN has learned the Obama administration is expected to announce Thursday a Pentagon plan to keep the aircraft carrier USS George H. W. Bush in the Mediterranean Sea longer than planned to help reassure NATO allies in the wake of the Russian invasion of Crimea. One official said U.S. military assets in the region are being reviewed for ""what stays, what goes, what gets moved around."" Although the U.S. effort with Russia focuses on diplomatic initiatives, the military part of the equation was discussed in depth at a White House meeting Tuesday, the military official confirmed. Asked about the decision to keep the aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean, a senior administration official said not to expect much more muscle-flexing, or additional military steps, between now and Sunday's referendum in Crimea. G7 tells Russia to back off . The G7 -- the world's leading industrial powers without Russia -- and leaders of the European Council and Commission issued a strongly worded statement calling on Russia to ""cease all efforts to change the status of Crimea contrary to Ukrainian law and in violation of international law."" The statement urged Russia to immediately halt actions supporting the referendum. ""Any such referendum would have no legal effect. Given the lack of adequate preparation and the intimidating presence of Russian troops, it would also be a deeply flawed process which would have no moral force. For all these reasons, we would not recognize the outcome,"" it said. It warned that the annexation of Crimea could have ""grave implications"" for the legal order protecting the sovereignty of all states. ""Should the Russian Federation take such a step, we will take further action, individually and collectively,"" it said. The G7 nations -- the United States, Canada, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy and Japan -- had already suspended preparations for a planned G8 summit in the Russian city of Sochi in June in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. World stage . The peninsula in the Black Sea, with a population of just over 2 million people, has stepped into the spotlight of the world stage. The West has been preparing sanctions and at the same time telling Moscow that there is a way out of an economic and diplomatic showdown: Talk to Ukraine's new government and don't intervene militarily. Moscow has denounced the events that led to Yanukovych's ouster as an illegitimate coup and has refused to recognize the new Ukrainian authorities. Yanukovych, currently in Russia, insists he is still the legitimate leader of Ukraine and has vowed to return to Kiev ""as soon as the circumstances allow."" He fled Kiev on February 22 after three months of protests against his decision to scrap a trade deal with the European Union and embrace closer ties with Russia. Putin has said his government has the right to protect ethnic Russians living there. Unarmed military and civilian observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe are now on the ground in the city of Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine, the regional security bloc said via Twitter. The team was repeatedly turned back from entering Crimea by armed men. A report by the OSCE observer team said that although it was prevented from entering Crimea, its ""observations produced significant evidence of equipment consistent with the presence of Russian Federation military personnel (in the vicinity of) the various roadblocks encountered."" The evidence included Russian pattern uniforms and equipment without identifying patches, as well as trucks bearing license plate numbers associated with Russia's Black Sea Fleet, the observers said. ""This report adds to our deep concerns and clearly suggests direct involvement by the Russian Federation and its agents in preventing impartial, unarmed observers from doing the work they are supposed to do,"" U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE Daniel Baer said. ""Russian encouragement of and support for illegal checkpoints is unhelpful."" Meanwhile, the United Nations said assistant secretary-general for human rights, Ivan Simonovic, had canceled a visit to Crimea -- primarily because of the logistical challenges at Simferopol airport and because he had been informed by authorities that he could not be received. Aid package clears early hurdle . Eight U.S. senators, led by Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, are scheduled to travel to Ukraine in coming days. Meanwhile, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved a package of loans and aid for Ukraine on Wednesday, along with sanctions against Russia for its military intervention. The measure, which now heads to the full Senate, also includes the approval of long-delayed reforms at the International Monetary Fund. The aid package includes $1 billion in loan guarantees from the United States as well as $50 million to boost democracy-building in Ukraine and $100 million for enhanced security cooperation for Ukraine and some of its neighbors. The full Senate will vote on the package after the chamber returns from a recess. ""It always takes time to make good things,"" Yatsenyuk said Wednesday night, adding that his country praised the United States for its support. Russia: 'Absolutely legitimate' Russian officials have compared Crimea's potential departure from Ukraine to Kosovo's secession from Serbia after many years of bloody civil war with its former neighbor. Western governments recognized the separation over bitter opposition from Serbia and its historical allies in Moscow. In a written statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry cited it as a precedent for the ""absolutely legitimate"" Crimean vote. ""The Russian Federation will respect the results of the free vote of Crimea's people during the referendum,"" it said. INTERACTIVE: Comparing military forces . CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported from Simferopol, as did journalist Nadjie Femi. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London and Steve Almasy and Ben Brumfield wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Five more states reported widespread flu activity during the second week of January, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, bringing the total to 40 states. Only 10 states are not yet reporting widespread activity: Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Vermont. ""Widespread"" means that more than 50% of geographic regions in a state -- counties, for example -- are reporting flu activity. The designation addresses the spread of the flu, not its severity. However, the number of states experiencing a high proportion of outpatient visits to health care providers for flulike illnesses is 14 -- Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia -- down from 20 in the previous week. Ten children died from complications of the flu last week, bringing the pediatric death total for the season to 20. The CDC does not have data on the number of adult flu deaths. Experts estimate the number of flu-related deaths range from as low as 3,000 to as high as 49,000 people each year. Typically, the flu season begins in the winter months and peaks in January or February, according to the CDC. But it's way too early to know if flu has peaked yet this year. ""As typical of a flu season, some areas are being harder hit than other areas,"" said CDC spokesman Tom Skinner. H5N1 kills first person in North America . One of those areas is California. Dr. Gil Chavez, deputy director for California's Center for Infectious Diseases, said 45 people under the age of 65 have died during the 2013-2014 flu season, which began in September. This includes two deaths in children. ""An additional 50 deaths are currently being investigated and are likely to be confirmed next week,"" Chavez said. He said that a year ago, only five deaths had been reported at this time; there were only 106 flu deaths during the entire 2012-2013 flu season. ""H1N1 is the predominant virus circulating, and we do know when H1N1 predominates, there appears to be more fatalities,"" Chavez said. ""We seem to have a predominance of a more deadly strain."" H1N1 is the same virus that caused a pandemic in 2009, Dr. Michael Jhung, a medical officer in the CDC's flu division, has said. It was dubbed swine flu because it was being seen for the first time in humans. Since then, ""it's established itself very nicely in the human population,"" Jhung said. H1N1 has been seen every season since 2009 in people and is no longer referred to as swine flu. The strain is so common that it was included in this year's vaccination, he said. Adult flu deaths are not required to be reported to the CDC, but the government agency must be notified of any flu deaths in children. However, after H1N1 first surfaced, California health officials determined this was not enough. Chavez said the lesson learned then was that ""we needed a better way to determine the impact [of flu] on the community. So we in California made the decision to make deaths due to influenza in individuals under 65 mandatory to report."" What consumers need to know is that it's not too late to take steps to protect yourself from getting the flu, said Dr. Susan Rehm, medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. ""People who are young and healthy should be aware that they may get the flu and it could be serious,"" Rehm said. One of the reasons people often say they don't get the flu vaccine is because they don't get sick. That excuse doesn't hold up, she said. In addition to getting the vaccine, which can prevent flu -- or at least lessen symptoms, washing your hands frequently and staying home when you're sick can help you get through the flu season. Doctors recommend using antivirals within the first two days of experiencing any flulike symptoms. Does cold weather cause colds? CNN's Ashley Hayes contributed to this story.","40 states reported widespread flu activity during the second week of January .
