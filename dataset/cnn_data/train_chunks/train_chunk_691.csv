As the cardinals gathered in Rome to choose their leader in a secret ballot, it was said the National Security Agency intercepted phone calls made to and from the priests’ residence occupied by the then-Archbishop of Buenos Aires Jorge Maria Bergoglio.

Other leading bishops and cardinals were also being monitored by US spies, weekly current affairs magazine Panorama claimed. ‘It is feared that the great ear of the United States may have continued to intercept the conversations of prelates until the end of the conclave, March 12, 2013,' the magazine said. Archbishop Bergoglio had been a person of interest to the CIA since 2005, it claimed. The latest revelations follow allegations by American website Crytome that the US monitored 46million Italian telephone calls last year. Calls by former Pope Benedict, who resigned in February this year, may have been among them – as voice traffic to and from the Vatican was also intercepted, Panorama said. Intercepted?

Conversations relating to the selection of new President of the Vatican Bank were also said to have monitored. US spies divided information from Vatican targets into categories including Leadership intentions, Threats to financial system, Foreign Policy Objectives and Human Rights, the magazine claimed. A secret-service cell made up of NSA and CIA operatives continues to work out of the US embassy in Rome, the news weekly said, citing 2010 documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. As well as analysing voice and data traffic from tapped mobile phones, the operatives follow money trails through contacts who are database administrators, bankers and engineers with access to high-security sites, it was reported. The NSA has denied the allegations. 'The National Security Agency does not target the Vatican. Assertions that NSA has targeted the Vatican, published in Italy's Panorama magazine, are not true,' agency spokeswoman Vanee Vines said in a statement. The Holy See said it had no knowledge of any such activity.

Two married councillors have refused calls to stand down - despite moving to a village 150 miles away. Conservatives Alan and Jean Willicombe, from Sittingbourne, Kent, retired to the Lincolnshire village of Gedney Drove End earlier this month. But the pair have sparked outrage by saying they will keep their seats on Swale Borough Council - and commute to meetings at the taxpayer's expense. The former mayor and mayoress, who have each served for more than 10 years, will continue to claim allowances of at least £4,737 each. They will also pocket travel expenses of between £130 and £175 every time they drive to a meeting. This is despite their new phone number not appearing on Swale Borough Council's website. Instead residents are given phone numbers for two colleagues who still live in Sittingbourne. 'Murky, dirty and puerile': How one resident described the decision by councillors Alan and Jean Willicombe, pictured, to keep their seats on Swale Borough Council, Kent, despite starting a new life 150 miles away . 'Disgraceful': The 300-mile round trip the pair must take for every meeting, costing taxpayers up to £175 . Mr Willicombe said it was pointless to force the council to pay for a by-election because the Woodstock ward, which the couple represent, will disappear in 2015 under boundary changes. He added: 'I wasn’t going to stand again in 2015 because my ward was being dismantled and it’s the same for Jean. 'I don’t think there is a point to standing down - I can still work and be in contact with the other councillors. 'Why have the cost of another election? It seems a bit stupid.' But furious resident John Greenhill, 64, said the councillors’ relocation was 'murky, dirty and puerile'. He said: 'They didn’t have the decency to inform their constituents they were going. 'I think it’s a disgraceful situation - how can they honestly say they represent the people of this ward? 'It’s a despicable political tactic so they don’t have to resign for fear of the Tories losing their stranglehold of this borough and can’t be replaced by Labour or UKIP councillors. 'They were hardly seen about the ward when they were here. If they were honourable, they would resign.' The pair are a former mayor and mayoress of Swale and Mr Willicombe previously served as a Kent county councillor. Mr Willicombe said: 'We . put our property up for sale just to see what the market was like and . we sold it in two days, which was far quicker than we ever expected. 'We thought it would take six months to a year - so it pushed us into looking for somewhere far quicker than we wanted to. 'It’s . just the way things panned out. I have got a sister up here and . properties are cheaper - it’s as simple as that, and it will be nice to . retire to.' The home in Gedney Drove End, Lincolnshire, where the pair moved earlier this month. A round trip to council meetings in Sittingbourne, Kent, will cost taxpayers between £130 and £175 depending on what car they drive . Mrs Willicombe was Mayoress of Swale in 2008-09. Her husband said: 'Why have the cost of another election? It seems a bit stupid' The couple can claim 42.9p a mile for travel if they drive a car whose engine is smaller than 1,000cc. But they can claim 58.7p a mile - 13.7p more than the government recommends for private firms - if it is larger than 1,200cc, which accounts for most family cars. Kent county councillor for UKIP Mike Baldock said: 'I know they haven’t been to Tunstall Parish Council since May - there was a big meeting about the school and they were not there. 'If it was my party, I would expect them to stand down. If they were still able to regularly attend meetings and give a good service, that’s OK.' The Conservative group leader on Swale Borough Council, Cllr Andrew . Bowles, said: 'It’s unfortunate, but without knowing the full facts, . it’s difficult to comment. 'It’s difficult to ask people to stand for election somewhere that’s going to disappear. 'The people who are technically represented by Alan and Jean won’t be in future - it’s an unusual situation.' Robert Oxley, campaign director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Councillors living on the other side of the country cannot claim to be credible representatives of the local community. 'Claiming travel expenses for a 300-mile round trip is clearly an unreasonable use of taxpayers' money. The pair should stand down rather than attempting to be absentee politicians at greater expense.' If the couple fail to attend meetings for six months they can be automatically disqualified from being a councillor.","Alan and Jean Willicombe left Sittingbourne, Kent, for Lincolnshire village .

When his 11-month-old Jack Russell vanished down a rabbit hole, the Earl of Cranbrook tried everything he could to find her – to no avail. By the time the storm of St Jude arrived on Monday, little Domino had been missing for three weeks and the Earl had given up all hope of ever seeing her again. But half an hour after the storm tore through his 900-acre estate near Saxmundham in Suffolk, a familiar, if bedraggled, figure staggered on to the lawn covered with dirt and sand. Jason Gathorne-Hardy (pictured) and his parents spent a day and a half digging to find Domino . Lord and Lady Cranbrook live on an arable farm at Great Glemham House, Saxmundham, Suffolk . The ferocious storm which caused so . much destruction had saved Domino by uprooting a tree, allowing her to . crawl free of the hole she had been stuck in for three weeks. Last night the Earl’s wife, . 77-year-old Lady Caroline, described the dog’s survival as ‘truly . remarkable’. She said: ‘The storm hit us at around 8.30am on Monday and . we were watching the trees bend in the wind. ‘Then about half an hour later, my . daughter looked out of the window upstairs and saw this yellowish animal . crawling and staggering across the lawn. ‘She screamed when she realised it was Domino and rushed outside to pick her up. ‘Our reaction was one of absolute disbelief. We were all thrilled and flabbergasted that she had returned. ‘It seemed so improbable that she could have survived underground for so long, but we have no other explanation.’ The family believe Domino was rescued by the storm after a tree where she was buried fell down . The fox terrier originated in the 19th century and is related to the modern white terrier breeds. The dogs were originally bred to dive into and flush foxes out of their holes during foxhunts. They general grow to no more than 40cm in height and weigh between seven and eight kilograms. The average lifespan of the dog is around 15 years. Lady Caroline said Domino was covered . in sand and her claws were worn down. ‘The sand had got into her eyes . and she was incredibly skinny,’ she said. ‘The strong winds must have . shifted the tree roots or something else underground to free her. ‘I have veterinary friends who have never heard of a dog surviving so long underground. ‘They think that the sandy soil might have helped her because she would have been able to drink water dripping through.’ Domino vanished on the afternoon of . October 7. The puppy was spotted by her daughter, Flora, 42, from her bedroom window . The fifth Earl, Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, 80, had taken her . out for a walk in the grounds of Great Glemham house when she bolted . after a rabbit.’ Later Lady Caroline returned to the . spot with her eldest son Jason Gathorne-Hardy, who has the title Lord . Medway, and they could hear a faint bark. Two workers dug with spades . until nightfall but they could not reach Domino. Domino is now making a healthy recovery but has not lost her fascination with rabbit holes despite the ordeal . ‘The next day we carried on digging . and brought in the excavator to shift all the sandy soil from the area, . but we heard absolutely nothing,’ said Lady Caroline. Lord Medway, 44, . said he is in no doubt that Domino’s escape was ‘thanks to St Jude’. ‘It is quite fitting that St Jude . saved her because he is the patron saint of lost causes. She was a lost . cause if ever there was one – lost and buried underground . The Earl of Cranbrook title was created in 1892 by Conservative politician Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, who held office as Home Secretary at one stage. The current Lord Cranbrook, who succeeded his father in 1978 to become the fifth earl, has a PhD in the biology of cave swiftlets – the Southeast Asian birds that build edible nests. The 80-year-old has also held a number of positions in the voluntary, public and private sector. He has served as an elected parish and district councillor, a member of the Natural Environment Research Council, a trustee of the Natural History Museum and as chairman of the Institute for European Environmental Policy. Lady Caroline Cranbrook, meanwhile, has made her name as a local food campaigner in Suffolk. She has served as president of the Aldeburgh Food and Drink Festival, with a mission to encourage people to see where food comes from, and has also worked with the Suffolk Development Agency. Their son, Jason Gathorne-Hardy, is a nature artist and zoologist.","Puppy went missing after diving down a rabbit hole .

'When you have different layers of . air travelling at different speeds, along with changes in temperature . and density, then it can lead to this wave-like formation.

Hours of wait: Migrants queue to receive their daily supply of a hot meal provided by volunteers working for the charity 'SALAM' in Calais, France . Towards new horizons: The number of refugees arriving has not lessened with recent destruction of refugee camps in Calais, and Syrian migrants are increasing by the day, according to volunteers . Tricked: Many of the campers, mainly men hoping to be able to provide for their families from their new country, have been given false hope by human trafficker of the ease with which they would cross the border into Britain . Unlike France, the UK pays benefits to . asylum seekers while their claim is being processed, a glimmer of hope . for the 1,000 or so who are camping in squalid conditions near the Calais ferry port. The lucky ones sleep in tents on the grassy slopes near the terminal or on disused rail tracks close by.

Long journey: A Syrian migrant displays a picture on his mobile phone of a packed fishing boat, on which he traveled illegally from Greece to Italy . Time of need: Mohammed, a Syrian migrant, rests in his tent underneath blankets donated by a local charity . Squalor: Some do not even have a tent, but sleep under tarpaulin held up by sticks, such as this Afghan man, attempting to keep warm with donated blankets . Close to the action: The little camps tend to be split by nationality and are dotted around the ferry terminal by the English Channel . Longing for Britain: The migrants in the camp have no desire to stay in France, but see Calais as a short stop on their way to their final destination - the UK . The . migrants are mostly young men from countries including Afghanistan, . Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, and Somalia, with a noticeable increase in Syrian . refugees in the past year. The . latter group, in particular, has caused upset in the area, as France . has offered to take in Syrian asylum seekers, yet many of these men wish . for a future in the UK due to their treatment. In . an open letter to MEP's earlier this month, the Syrian refugees in .

'For . example, in Calais, France, we are sleeping outside and have no food or . shelter to protect us from the winter cold just because we have chosen . to go and live in England. In other hand, in Italy the police take our . prints by force to prevent us to go anywhere else.

In his map, A History of Residential Contruction in the USA, scientist Seth Kadish has tracked the building of houses around the country from pre-1930s to now. The maps uses shades of purple and yellow to show when the most houses were built in a given county. The map shows that vast swathes of the country's homes in the West and Southeast were built in the 1900s, and even more in the Northeast and Midwest were built in the 1930s or before. Visual statistics: In the pale yellow counties, more homes were built pre-1930s than in any other period, and the darker counties have mostly modern structures . There are only two counties in the whole country in which houses from the 1940 predominate, Anderson County, Tennessee, and Cottle County, Texas. Three counties have predominantly homes built from 2005 to 2013: Cameron Parish, Louisiana, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana and Hancock COunty, Mississippi. Plaquemines Parish was one of three Louisiana towns most heavily hit by Hurricane Katrina, which explains its plurality of new homes. Hancock County was also severely struck. Cameron Parish was similarly decimated by Hurricane Rita in 2005 and Hurricane Ika in 2008. Home school: This graph shows the distribution of construction in another way . Seth Kadish says that according to his map, the typical county would have mostly houses built in the 1970s, then an even distribution of pre-1940, 1980s, and 1990s houses, then an even distribution of 1950s, 1960s, and post-2000 houses, and the smallest number of houses from the 1940s. Kadish said he became interested in the distribution of construction eras after he and his wife moved to Portland Oregan into a house built in 2006. Previously, the couple had lived in a 1930s condo in Providence, Rhode Island.

One of the key figures within the Muslim Brotherhood has been arrested on charges of inciting supporters to murder his opponents, Egypt's Interior Ministry have confirmed. Essam el-Erian, deputy leader of the Freedom and Justice Party, the Muslim Brotherhood's political phalanx, was taken during an early morning raid on an apartment in New Cairo . The arrest of El-Eiran, who has been on the run since President Mohammed Morsi was ousted in July, saw several violent protests break out at universities across the country, including in Cairo and Alexandria. Raid: This photo of Essam el-Erian, deputy leader of the political arm of the Muslum Brotherhood, was posted on Egypt's Interior Ministry's Facebook page, and is said to show him after his arrest today . El-Erian is also one of the defendants in the Morsi trial. He is accused of inciting Brotherhood followers to break up anti-Morsi protesters gathered outside the presidential palace late last year. In photographs broadcast on state television following his arrest, the smiling 59-year-old el-Erian is wearing a white galabiya, the traditional male robe, and a skullcap. The official state news agency MENA said el-Erian was arrested after a raid on an apartment in the eastern suburb of New Cairo, where he had been hiding. He was later transferred to the Torah prison complex in southern Cairo, where most of the group's arrested leaders are held. The agency said he will be interrogated at Torah on accusations of inciting violence in a number of anti-government protests. The prosecutors later ordered el-Erian detained for 30 days on new accusations of inciting murder and attempted murder, organizing an armed mob and inciting the possession of arms during two protests in Giza against the current government that left more than nine dead. Brotherhood leader: Essam El-Erian, pictured in May this year, has been arrested on charges of inciting supporters to murder his opponents, . Proof: Essam el-Erian, allegedly pictured at the raid of an apartment in eastern Cairo early Wednesday . While Morsi was in power, el-Erian frequently spoke publicly, often causing a stir as he turned from a moderate to a hard-line member of the group. Hours after el-Erian's arrest, pro-Muslim Brotherhood student protesters stormed the administrative building of Al-Azhar Islamic university in Cairo. They smashed windows and equipment while besieging the office of university's chief and other administrators. The assault prompted university officials to call the police to break up the rowdy protests. Riot police forces entered the campus and freed the officials, security officials said. The university, where the Brotherhood has a strong base, has been scene to near-daily protests. Wednesday's protest, however, was the first time students threatened the university president; although they had besieged the administrative building before. Mahmoud Salah, one of the protesters, denied the violence was the work of the students. He accused authorities of planting troublemakers among them to stir the violence. ‘Our protests are peaceful,’ he told reporters. ‘We are against the coup.’ Salah said police forces stormed the campus with armored vehicles and arrested students. Clashes: The arrest led to several violent student protests across Egypt, including in Cairo and Alexandria (file photo of Cairo protests) Television footage of the university showed damage inside the offices. Graffiti covered building walls, including one message inside that read: ‘CC Killer,’ referring to Egypt's military chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. Clashes between Brotherhood supporters and army supporters erupted on the campuses of universities in Egypt's second largest city, Alexandria, and in the Delta city of Zagazig, leaving at least 22 students injured. In Alexandria, the clashes damaged a university cafeteria, security officials said. Following Morsi's ouster, the country's new, military-backed authorities cracked down on the group, arresting hundreds of Brotherhood figures and putting top leaders on trial. The authorities are seeking to show through the prosecutions that the Brotherhood fueled violence during Morsi's one-year presidency and after the coup. Calls for reconciliation that would return the Brotherhood - which dominated elections after the 2011 fall of Hosni Mubarak - to the political system have gone nowhere, with neither side giving ground. El-Erian's arrest came just hours after three judges presiding over a trial of nearly three dozen Brotherhood members, including its top spiritual leader and its chief financier, stepped down on Tuesday after security agencies refused to let the defendants attend the courtroom sessions. The move was a sharp pushback from within the judiciary over the conduct of the trial amid criticism by the Brotherhood that wide-ranging prosecutions of its leaders, including Morsi and the group's spiritual guide, Mohammed Badie, are only vengeful show trials. Morsi's trial is due to begin on Monday, . yet it has not been confirmed whether the 62-year-old, who has been held . at an undisclosed location since the July coup, will appear.","Deputy leader of Muslim Brotherhood party arrested on Wednesday .

The White House claims it can't fulfill a request to deem the controversial Westboro Baptist Church a hate group. But it said President Barack Obama considered the group's actions - which include picketing at solders' funerals - reprehensible. The Obama administration was responding to petitions through the White House website that called for the Church group to be deemed a hate group and the federal government to revoke its tax-exempt status. Almost 700,000 people signed five related petitions demanding action. But the White House said it was unable to change the status of the church because the government doesn't maintain a list of hate groups. The group claims when American troops die, it's God's punishment for America tolerating homosexuality and abortion. No luck: The White House claims it can't fulfill a request to deem the controversial Westboro Baptist Church, pictured, a hate group . But the White House is releasing a map showing where the petition-signers come from. The map shows high density in Kansas, where the Westboro group is based, and Connecticut, where church members threatened to picket Newtown victims' funerals. The news comes just two weeks after a gay wedding was held a few feet from the  infamous Westboro Baptist Church's headquarters. Followers of the religion are known for their 'God Hates Fags' placards and anti-gay preaching. Kimberly Kidwell and Katie Short exchanged vows on June 22 outside the rainbow-painted Equality House across the street in Topeka, Kansas.

Aaron Jackson, one of the founders of the Equality House's Planting Peace charity, described the  event as 'absolutely perfect.' 'The community came out in droves and just showed their support, holding up signs expressing their support for the event. It was a really incredible thing to see,' he told the New York Daily News.

Although same-sex marriage is not legal in Kansas, the couple wanted to raise awareness of the issue. The property they married in front of was bought last year by Planting Peace charity founder  Jackson, 31, and in March it was painted with the colors of the pride flag. The little bungalow acts as the perfect counter protest to the Westboro Baptist Church who believe that the United States government is immoral due to its tolerance of homosexuality. The two-bedroom house, which cost $81,000, now sits proudly directly opposite the founding base of the non-affiliated group which describes itself as a 'church'. The guerrilla protest against the Westboro Baptists is particularly fitting given their sporadic demonstrations interrupting the funerals of dead servicemen with their odd anti-gay rhetoric and chants. The small sect believe homosexuality is the root of all the world's evil and the refusal to denounce it is the cause of all tragedy, including deaths in war. The Westboro Baptist Church, which is believed to have just a few dozen members, was founded in Topeka, Kansas in 1955 by Fred Phelps.

After the man finished up his pizza and left, a waitress came over to the family and told her the young man had paid the family's bill and left them with a Pizza Hut gift card.

The . budget supermarket is making reindeer steaks central to a Christmas . advertising push designed to attract middle-class shoppers. The . steaks are part of its ‘Deluxe’ range that will feature in the . company’s first multi- million pound TV advertising campaign in Britain. Packs of frozen . reindeer steaks, which are a seasonal treat in Scandinavian countries, . will sell for £7.99 each, while other products include a whole cooked . lobster for £5.99, a large serrano ham for £39.99, a three fish roast . for £5.69 and caviar for £1.49 a pot.

Samsung has officially launched its first super-thin curved TV screen with a price tag of £8,500 ($13,000) - five times more than its flat-screen equivalents. The 55-inch model has a high-resolution OLED display and its design means the screen is an equal distance from the viewer at all times. It is now on sale in South Korea but Samsung told Reuters the set will be made available in other countries from July - the first time a curved TV of its kind has been sold outside of Asia. Samsung has launched its first high-resolution curved TV in South Korea before releasing it worldwide from July. The 55-inch model costs £8,500, has an OLED screen and is the first set to be made available outside Asia . Kim Hyunsuk, Samsung's executive vice president, stands with a model next to the company's new OLED curved TV screen. The curved display helps eliminate the distortion of images. It is only the second 55-inch curved TV screen to go on sale after rival LG started selling its own version in May . OLED's (organic light-emitting diodes) are used to create digital displays in TVs, computer monitors, phones, tablets and games consoles. An OLED display works without a backlight, which means it can display deep . black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal . display (LCD). In low lighting, an . OLED screen can produce a higher contrast ratio than an LCD, too. The Korean company announced the television during the Consumer Electronics Show in January this year. At the time, Samsung's curved screen was . the world's first yet delays in the manufacturing process meant that . rival LG beat the company to selling the device. Speaking at the launch event Kim Hyunsuk, Samsung . executive vice president, said: 'We have just introduced our first OLED TV and have to see consumer . response to gauge overall market demand.' Samsung said it will begin selling its curved OLED television outside South Korea from July but did not specify which countries. It also said it has no plans to offer a non-curved one this year. The concave display gives viewers a sense of being immersed in the images. Samsung claims its 'Timeless Arena' design reduces the chance of images appearing pixelated, too. The 55-inch OLED screen also supports Samsung TV features such as multi-view that lets two people watch different things at the same time.

A Victoria train carriage that spent more than half a century as a cricket pavilion has returned to the tracks after nearly 80 years. The first-class carriage was built in 1886 and used at a Somerset coal mine before being adopted by a cricket club. After moving to a recreation ground in Templecombe, Somerset, the coach spent more than 50 years standing on the side of the pitch. It was one of two train carriages used by the club as changing rooms for players. This Victorian train, once used as a cricket pavilion, has been returned to the tracks after more than 80 years . The carriage was one of two used by the recreation ground in Templecombe in Somerset . The Somerset and Dorset Railway Trust recognised the historical significance of the carriage, which was built in 1886 and used by a coal mine . But, in 1986, 100 years after it was built, the cricket club announced plans to get rid of the carriage to make way for new facilities. George Judd, who was living in the area, offered to take it to Washford, Somerset, where a team of volunteers for the Somerset and Dorset Railway Trust (SDRT) got to work restoring it. The Victorian train was built in 1886 . This is what the interior of the rail carriage would have looked like when it was created in the late 1800s . One of two carriages used at the cricket club, Mr Judd, now 75, recognised the historical importance of the carriage, and felt it should be rescued. Mr Judd, one of the founding members of the SDRT, said if the trust hadn’t stepped in the carriage may have been burned. Just less than 30 years on, with three help of between 30 and 40 volunteers, the work is done and the train made its debut at the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway gala.

Breaking it up: The police arrived at the house to try to calm the group of placard holders . Issues: Kerri Kasem says she has no idea why she might be banned from seeing her father however her father told he in the past that her step-mother Jean (pictured) was insecure. She says that she hasn¿t even been allowed in the house for 10 years . In fact, she and her siblings - from Casey's first marriage to Linda Myers - just want to see their father. 'Your children are here for you,' Kerri told the website. 'We have not abandoned you."" The group held signs up with various messages imploring Jean to relent. One of his daughters held up a neon placard with the words: 'Jean, why won't you let me see my Dad.' Apparently, the protest has nothing to do with money. None of the children are beneficiaries in Casey’s will. Peacemaker: A police officer was seen ringing the buzzer in an attempt to speak to Jean Kasem . Loud and clear: Casey's kids haven't seen their father in so long and are anxious to know how he's faring . Kerri . Kasem told Fox News, 'She can have it all.' We've always said this to . our Dad, 'Give it to her. Come and live with people who love you.' We don't want any of it. We don't care about the money. We make good livings. We're all self-sufficient. We all have great jobs, great careers, self-esteem and we're proud of who we are. I am who I am today because of my Dad. I'm not after his money because of the morals and integrity I have because of how my father raised us. I just want to see my Dad before he dies, that's it! It's awful because . we are such a close family. I talked to my Dad every single day before . he got sick and couldn't talk on the phone.’ Kerri . Kasem believes that if her father is allowed contact with his kids, . receives the  medical care he needs and the physical therapy and the . love, his condition could improve somewhat. Taking a rest: The protesters took a break and sat down on a wall . Don Pitts, Kasem's agent of more than 35 years, told CNN he did not want to take sides in the argument, but he did say Casey is still of sound mind at age 81. 'He has Parkinson's, has it very bad. It took his speech, and for somebody who made millions of dollars using his voice -- for him to lose that gift, that beautiful instrument -- it must be frustrating. But he's handling it very well,' Mr Pitts said. 'His mind is very sharp, his brain works well. You can tell in his eyes he understands everything you're saying. He just has trouble translating it from the brain to his vocal cords.' Kasem was married to Linda Myers from 1972 to 1979 and had three children together: Mike, Julie, and Kerri Kasem. Kasem has been married to American actress Jean Kasem since 1980 and had one child together, Liberty Jean Kasem. Along with his successful DJ-ing career, .

Kingpin: Charmaine Roman was arrested September 30 for her role in a violent Jamaican drug trafficking ring and now authorities say she was, in fact, the group's kingpin . A Florida woman was arrested in September on suspicions she aided a Jamaican drug trafficking ring and now  authorities say the Orange County grandmother was actually the group’s kingpin. Charmaine Roman drove a Land Rover and lived in flashy condo, gambled avidly, and helped to raise her young grandson. She was a typical wealthy Florida grandmother except for one difference: her lifestyle was paid for by a violent, multimillion dollar organized crime ring. Roman, who authorities have been watching since 2006, did the books according to police. The . Orlando Sentinel reports that the 42-year-old was in charge of the . group’s finances and helped launder money at the Wynn Casino in Las . Vegas to the tune of $3 million. While . she deposited $3.3 million at the Wynn between 2010 and 2012, Roman . paid far less in federal taxes according to case records. Police say she used the cover of a concert promotion company called Sure Thing Investments. Meanwhile, . a surprising amount of the grandmother’s income reportedly came not . just racketeering but also from her gambling habits. Since October 2009, Roman had redeemed 44 winning lottery tickets totaling $187,000. One . of the wins may have also led to a violent home invasion in 2009, the . Sentinel reports. After winning $15,000 on a scratch off ticket, robbers . broke into the Roman home and tied her and her daughters up, demanding . they be given the money. And just last August, Roman won an astonishing $100,000 on a ticket. But the gambling was a hobby. The drug trade is allegedly what really paid the bills. Varied interests: Roman's arrest came as part of a sting that seized over 3,000 pounds of marijuana. Her hobby appears to be scratch off lottery tickets. Between 2009 and 2012, the grandmother won $187,000 . After years of surveillance and intelligence gathering, authorities finally pinched Roman September 30 as she pulled into an Orlando parking lot to during the delivery of a 400-pound shipment of marijuana. She was arrested along with 50 as part of a sting police dubbed Operation Warehouse 13 that saw the seizure of 3,200 pounds of marijuana, $200,000 cash, 15 guns, and several cars. Police dismantled the group and charged Roman and her cohorts with racketeering, trafficking in pot, and other charges. Prosecutors allege the group has brought thousands of pounds of marijuana into Central Florida, and with it a tendency to do business violently. Weapons: 15 guns, cars, and $200,000 in cash was found during Roman's drug ring bust September 30 . In her possession were multiple cell phones, several passports in different names, four Florida ID cards, Social Security cards, credit cards and birth certificates. Some showed Roman’s name as Antoinette Lewis and police saw she had multiple aliases. Prosecutors allege Roman, who is Jamaican, is in the country illegally and has been for 20 years. They also remain unable to ascertain her genuine identity. ‘People generally don't have more than one identity,’ the judge said. Roman was deemed too great a flight risk and denied bond. Roman has no record of previous arrests in Florida.","Charmaine Roman is charged for her role as bookkeeper in a violent Jamaican marijuana smuggling ring in Central Florida .

Americans under 40 years old are worse off than their parents for the first time since the Great Depression. Twenty and 30-somethings, also known as Generation Y and X, are the only age group in the country currently worse off than their parents three decades ago, according to a recent study by the Urban Institute titled 'Lost Generations? Wealth Building among Young Americans'. Americans in their 30s have been hit particularly hard—their average net worth has decreased 21 per cent from what previous 30-somethings had in 1983, CBS reported. Stagnation: A recent study by the Urban Institute found that younger generations are no longer better off than their parents. The average net worth of 30-somthings today has decreased 21 per cent since those in 1983 . The grim study, published by a Washington, D.C., think tank, noted that Americans' wealth has 'grown significantly' despite the poor state of the economy. In fact, the average household wealth doubled from 1983 to 2010 and incomes have increased—but this is not the case for younger generations. 'For many, the American dream of working hard, saving more, and becoming wealthier than one'sparents holds true,' the study's authors write. 'Unless you're under 40.' Typically, as society gets wealthier, children get richer than their parents, the study notes. For instance, the average net worth of Baby Boomers aged 56 to 64 increased 120 per cent from their counterparts in 1983. Americans over 74 have an average net worth 149 per cent more than the oldest citizens three decades ago. Line: Younger generations, shown at the bottom with turquoise and red lines, are not accumulating wealth over time like previous generations . This trend is no longer the case, . partially because the Great Recession hit young homeowners in their 20s . and 30s the hardest. But the study's authors say younger generations . were in trouble even before the recession hit. Stagnant wages, diminishing job . opportunities and shrinking home values play an important role in . younger American's harsh new reality. Lack of educational attainment . higher than previous generations also factored in. College debt stifles potential savings as well. Most jobs—even some with low hourly wages—require . at least a four-year degree. Some 20 million Americans attend college . each year and nearly 60 per cent borrow to pay for school, according to . the nonprofit American Student Assistance. All . those loans amount to roughly $870 billion in outstanding student debt, . according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A quarter of . 30-somethings have outstanding loan debt, but only 7.4 per cent of . borrowers older than 40 have outstanding debt. Stressed: Unlike their parents, 20 and 30-somethings aren't able to save money, using much of their earnings to pay bills, student loans and rent . Because of these burdens, younger Americans can't imagine saving and building up a nest egg like their parents. Myya Beck, a 33-year-old from Wellfleet, Mass., laughed when CBS asked her if she had any savings. 'My glass is always half full. I'm still day by day trying to something more. What else is there?' Beck said. Beck runs her own fitness studio and works nonstop, but continues to struggle. Her earnings go directly to bills, college loans, rent and a car payment. Changes: In the past, kids earned more than their parents as society became wealthier, but this is no longer the case . With a baby on the way, Beck is worried about her future. She owes over $15,000 in college loans. 'I mean, this is everything that I've ever wanted. I've always wanted to own my own business,' she said. 'I've wanted to be a mom and have a family most importantly, of my own, so I've gotten those things, but financially how do I do it?' The study's authors suggest the government should pay more attention to the hardships of younger generations—or else. 'If current trends for younger generations are not reversed, within a few decades they may become more dependent than older Americans today, especially in retirement, upon safety net programs less capable of providing basic support,' the study concludes.","Urban Institute study says younger generations don't build as much wealth .

Shoppers are raiding their savings and using billions of pounds paid in PPI compensation by the banks to go on a spending spree. Retail sales are growing at their fastest rate since the peak of the consumer boom in early 2008.The increase is at odds with evidence that pay rises continue to lag behind increases in the cost of food, energy and transport. The money appears to be coming from savings, credit cards and the £12billion paid out by the banks to consumers who were mis-sold payment protection insurance alongside loans and credit cards. Spending power: Shoppers have spent £12bn from savings, credit cards and PPI payments . The volume of retail sales in the three months from July to the end of September was up by 1.5 per cent on the previous quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics. The ONS said: ‘This is the largest quarter-on-quarter rise since March 2008 when the economy as a whole was at its peak, before the economic downturn.’ Car manufacturers and retailers say the PPI compensation has been a key factor. The quantity of retail sales in September was up by 2.2 per cent on a year ago, while their value was 3.2 per cent higher. Online shopping is growing particularly strongly, with the figure up by 19.1 per cent in September compared to a year ago. James McGregor, director of consultants Retail Remedy, said the rise in spending was driven by confidence that the economy was on the mend. He said: ‘The retail market continues to go from strength to strength, although its return will have many economists scratching their heads given where wage inflation is at. ‘We’ve had a spate of upbeat economic data and people can hear and see this. More importantly, they can sense that things are improving.’ Spree: Retail sales are growing at their fastest rate since early 2008 .","Shoppers raiding savings, credit cards and using PPI payments .

Police forces across the country have wasted hundreds of thousands of pounds by topping up patrol cars with the wrong type of fuel. Thirty seven constabularies have admitted that their police officers have made countless careless mistakes by filling up diesel engines with petrol and vice versa, costing the taxpayer at least £600,000 since 2009. In reality, the figure is likely to be even higher given 15 forces in England and Wales provided incomplete information to a Freedom of Information request filed by The Independent. Careless: Police forces have cost the taxpayer £600,000 by putting the wrong type of fuel in squad cars . To tackle the problem, Essex Police even installed 'talking fuel caps' at a cost of £4,000, which play a recorded message reminding officers what fuel was required. But it had little affect on the oblivious officers, who pumped petrol into diesel cars no fewer than 150 times between 2008 and 2013 at a cost of £32,726 - eight times the cost of the caps themselves. But a spokesperson said it had 'ceased to be a matter of great concern' as there had been a year-on-year decline in the number of incidents recorded. The spokesperson added: 'Over the years the force has made concerted efforts to reduce these instances of human error.' Oblivious: Despite warning signs and even 'talking fuel caps' officers have continued to make costly mistakes . In North Wales, bright yellow cap covers were installed in diesel cars seven years ago, but that did not stop officers causing damage costing £11,161 over four years. Leicestershire Police was handed a bill of £2,859 for just one mistake in 2010. And the Metropolitan Police force, which has a fleet of 6,500 vehicles, has spent £288,151 making repairs to 991 of them following errors at the pumps since 2009. A spokesperson said: 'If a vehicle is unavailable then clearly that's not ideal, but we can work around it.' They added there is no set punishment that is handed out to the officers who make such mistakes. Figures from the AA suggest at least 150,000 drivers fill up their cars with the wrong type of fuel each year. A spokesman said: 'Misfuelling seems to be associated particularly with the growth in diesel car sales. 'Modern diesels are so quiet it's easy to forget you're driving one, particularly if it's a second family car or hire car.'","A Freedom of Information request reveals true cost of refueling squad cars .

Motoring groups accused the Office of Fair Trading of ‘a whitewash’ yesterday after the watchdog ruled out a full inquiry into petrol prices. The OFT, which launched a probe last year, claimed there was no evidence drivers were being ripped off. For years motorists have complained that pump prices soar when the price of crude oil rises, but fail to drop if it then falls. Motorway service stations could be forced to advertise their prices on the hard shoulder so drivers know how much they will be charged before turning off . Drivers pay up to 8p a litre more at motorway services than at other forecourts, the OFT found . But in a surprise decision, the OFT ruled . out a full inquiry – saying there was ‘very limited evidence’ that . prices were being kept artificially high. Despite acknowledging ‘widespread mistrust’ by motorists, the OFT ruled ‘competition is working well’ in the petrol industry. It said price rises were mostly caused by rising crude oil costs and tax rises. The ruling was slammed as ‘a . whitewash’ by critics. They said the decision was ‘bitterly . disappointing’ and ‘a missed opportunity’ to give a fair deal to drivers . by making the issue of fuel pricing more transparent. FairFuelUK spokesman Quentin Willson . said: ‘Every motorist and business in Britain instinctively knows that . something’s not right. ‘UK consumers will be bitterly disappointed. The nation will feel let down. Quite frankly, I’m shocked.’ Road Haulage Association chief . executive Geoff Dunning said: ‘We asked for transparency but all we got . was a whitewash. The OFT acknowledges that high pump prices are a result . of high crude prices, not competition. The Office of Fair Trading said sharp rises in fuel prices was cause by increases in tax and not price-fixing by oil companies . ‘So why when the barrel price drops, is that not reflected at the pump?’ And the AA noted that since the start . of the year, the cost of filling a tank has risen with petrol now . costing 134.08p per litre and diesel 141.42p. AA president Edmund King said drivers . will be ‘bitterly disappointed and frustrated’ by the OFT. He said: . ‘Wholesale price surges that shot up 10p a litre and collapsed just as . quickly appeared at the pump in days – but took weeks to fall away.’ Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said many would find the OFT report ‘hard to believe’. Pre-tax petrol prices in the UK are amongst the lowest in Europe, the OFT said . But he noted the OFT was right to identify that British motorists pay the highest fuel tax in Europe, at 60p in every pound. ‘The OFT does identify the true cause . of drivers’ misery – the Chancellor and crude oil prices,’ Professor . Glaister said. ‘About 60 per cent of the pump price is accounted for by . fuel duty and VAT.’ The Petrol Retailers’ Association . ‘condemned’ the OFT ruling, which left garages having to ‘explain the . unexplainable’ to angry motorists on their forecourts. Tory MP Robert Halfon, who spearheaded . the Commons campaign against rip-off fuel prices, said the scandal . still needed to be addressed. He insisted: ‘Whatever the OFT says, . high prices at the pump are crushing families across Britain.

Jailed: Jack Smith has been sentenced to 21 years in prison for attacking a stranger with a meat cleaver . A violent thug who attacked a stranger with a meat cleaver in the street on New Year's Eve has been jailed for 21 years. Jack Smith managed to escape justice for more than five years after leaving Matthew Jeeves for dead following the unprovoked assault. But when DNA tests were carried out on a hat left at the scene of the attack in Cheam, Surrey, they proved that Smith was responsible. The 23-year-old from Morden in South London was sentenced to prison at Croydon Crown Court last Friday. Smith and an accomplice, Barry Hughes, set upon Mr Jeeves as he was walking home from a New Year's Eve party in the early hours of January 1, 2008. They demanded his mobile phone and money, before Hughes punched him in the face and knocked him to the ground. Smith and Hughes then hacked at their victim's head with a meat cleaver, leaving him with serious injuries. Mr Jeeves was eventually found by an off-duty police officer, and underwent multiple operations to reconstruct his face. He needed more than 100 stitches, and now has a scar running from above his right eye to his chin. Smith, aged just 17 at the time, was soon arrested but released due to a lack of evidence. However, the discovery of a hat at the crime scene allowed police to match his DNA. Earlier this year, he stabbed another man in a bar because he was looking at him, and also stabbed a woman in the ensuing melée. Brutal: A reconstruction of Matthew Jeeves's injuries after he was attacked by Smith and Barry Hughes . Last month he pleaded guilty to three counts of wounding with intent, one count of robbery and three firearms offences. During sentencing on Friday, judge Jeremy Gold QC told Smith: 'You no doubt thought you had got away with it, but you hadn't. This was a quite appalling attack in which the gratuitous violence far exceeded that needed to carry out a robbery. 'One of the blows pierced the victim's skull and you left him for dead. You have shown a casual approach to excessive violence and a complete disregard to the harm you cause.' Speaking outside court, Detective Inspector John McQuade, who was leading the investigation, branded the two men 'scum'. He said: 'Jack Smith is dangerous and the streets are safer without him. He was a menace to society. It's been a long time, but I'm glad we got a result for Matthew.' Mr Jeeves said: 'It's been a difficult five years, but I've got on with my life. I wasn't going to let them win. I'm just glad they cannot hurt anyone else.' Hughes is currently serving a 13-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to the attack last year.","Jack Smith and Barry Hughes set upon Matthew Jeeves with meat cleaver .

Youth is wasted on the young – so the saying goes – and doing their best to prove it are the over-50s. They are more sexually active than six years ago, according to a survey which also found that a third of the age group enjoy sex more than in their youth. Four in five of those in their early 50s make love  regularly, with a quarter enjoying a romantic episode under the sheets at least once a week. More than a quarter of men and a third of women enjoy sex more than when they were in their 20s . Passion remains important even among . those 20 years older, with almost half of the over-75s still having sex. One in ten of this age group say they have sex once a week. The findings chime with other . research that has revealed today’s over-50s are more likely to be over . the moon than over the hill. Most report being happy about their . health, relationships and finances – with contentment continuing to rise . well into their 70s. Nearly 9,000 people aged 50 or more were questioned about their sex lives by Populus on behalf of Saga Magazine for the survey. Almost three-quarters, or 71 per cent, reported having a healthy sex life, compared to 65 per cent in a similar study from 2007. While many admitted having less sex . than they used to, a quarter of men and a third of women said it was . more enjoyable than in their 20s and 30s. The fulfilment could be explained by . the fact that two-thirds felt there was less pressure on them to . perform. The average over-50 reported having seven sexual partners . during a lifetime. Men typically had eight partners, while women had . six. A fifth of over 50s have sex at least once a week and on average have had just seven lovers in their lifetime . Baby boomers – aged between 60 and 64 . – had the most sexual partners, with eight on average among men and . women. One in eight claimed to have slept with 20 people in total.

Giving more benefits to poor families will not address child poverty because too many irresponsible parents will spend it on alcohol or drugs, Iain Duncan Smith has warned. The Work and Pensions Secretary said parental addiction – not family income – had emerged as the main factor in determining a child’s life chances. He insisted that the last government’s strategy of spending more than £170billion in additional welfare payments had failed comprehensively. Mr Duncan Smith said giving the family ‘an extra pound in benefits’ can even push them further into difficulty if the cash is used to fuel a parent’s dependency on alcohol or drugs. In a speech today, he will suggest broader ways of calculating child poverty – including whether or not parents are in work, educational failure, family breakdown, problem debt, gambling and poor health. The Government is also planning new back-to-work programmes tailored specifically for benefit claimants with alcohol and drug problems. In remarks ahead of the speech, the Work and Pensions Secretary said Labour had ‘spent an unprecedented amount of money in their pursuit of child poverty targets, with some £170billion paid out in tax credits alone’ – but still missed their aim of halving child poverty. ‘Good intentions failed to translate into effective policies because the root causes of poverty cannot be solved by simply giving people a few more pounds in their pocket each week,’ he said. ‘Money matters, of course, and must remain central to our understanding of what it means to be in poverty. But there is now a broad agreement that simply calculating whether people sit above or below the relative income line does not do enough to reflect the reality of their lives. ‘How we measure poverty needs to expose the real challenges we face – however ugly and uncomfortable.’ Labour enshrined its measure of poverty – 60 per cent of median earnings – in law, and used tax credits to try to push families just over the line. It set a target to reduce the number of children living in relative income poverty to 1.7million by 2010/11, but only got the figure down to 2.3million. Labour fail: Mr Duncan Smith, pictured on Sunday, said that the previous government's welfare benefits strategy has done more harm than good to claimants . In the Coalition’s first year there was a reduction of 300,000. Ministers admit this was not because incomes rose for the poorest, but was largely due to a significant drop in the median income, demonstrating the absurdity of the current measure. Claimants of means-tested state benefits should be paid through cards that stop them spending on gambling or alcohol, a Left-leaning think-tank said yesterday. Pre-paid cards would increase equality by giving claimants a similar ability to use shops as people with chip-and-pin bank cards, the Demos report said. They would encourage responsible money management, and reward saving. Families on benefits could put a weekly cap on their spending or hold back a set figure from their money to pay rent. They could also have cards that would not work in betting shops or on gambling websites, or let them buy drink. Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke has tabled a ten minute rule bill that would stop benefit cash being used to buy cigarettes, alcohol, subscription TV or for gambling. ‘It is trying to help the poorest in society be able to manage their money better,’ he told Radio 4’s Today programme. The Coalition has agreed to tear up Labour’s definition, insisting that basing it purely on a crude measure of family income is perverse, when other factors can be just as critical in determining children’s life chances. Mr Duncan Smith said government polling showed people think having a parent addicted to drugs or alcohol is the most important factor for a child growing up in poverty. He added: ‘I’m by no means saying that every child in poverty will have drug or alcohol addicted parents. But we know the havoc that living with addiction can cause.’ Mr Duncan Smith said Labour’s approach was a ‘vicious trap’ and had left ‘disturbing number’ of people trapped in poverty. ‘There are around 100,000 people claiming sickness benefits whose illness is primarily down to their drug or alcohol addiction,’ he said. ‘Of these, 23,000 have been claiming incapacity benefits for a decade or more. Instead of propping people up on benefits, we need to tackle the root cause of their hardship – the drug addiction itself.’ One pilot scheme for addicted claimants will offer a financial incentive to support addicts who are in rehab, using work as a ‘stepping stone to recovery’. The second will bring in specialists to help others back to work. Labour MPs accuse the Government of changing the goalposts to mask the impact of its austerity policies. And Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: ‘Children are much more likely to be in poverty today because they have a parent who is a security guard, care worker or cleaner than a drug addict or “feckless”. ‘It’s right that the Government focuses on the damage that parental addiction can do to children, but a mistake to mix that up with poverty.’","Parental addiction, not income, is main reason for child poverty .

"By . James Nye . PUBLISHED: . 23:14 EST, 7 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:16 EST, 8 November 2013 . On December 29th of last year in the small mining town of Evanston, Wyoming, a 13-year-old boy and his 10-year-old sister walking under a railway bridge came upon the half-frozen body of man carrying only his ID, a piece of paper with a Californian phone number and a check for $54,000. The mystery only deepened when it was discovered that the hypothermia victim was 60-year-old Timothy Henry Gray, a long-lost relative of the reclusive and eccentric New York heiress Huguette Clark who stood to inherit a share of $34.5 million from her $300 million fortune. Disappearing from his basic rented accommodation nine months before, Gray managed to avoid the many private investigators who came looking for him as relatives of Clark scrambled in courts to get their share of her money. Evanston, Wyoming, U.S. - Kaiden, 13 and his sister Amber, 10, look towards the overpass where they found Timothy Gray the morning of December 29th. When the man didn't respond, they ran home to tell their mom they'd found a dead man . But why did a man who stood to inherit so much go out of his way to avoid it? And what do those who briefly knew him say that says about his opinions on the battle for Huguette Clark's millions? The search for these answers began with New York photographer, Elijah Solomon. Intrigued as to how such an apparent man of means and fortune could fall through the cracks of society and die cold and alone, Solomon set off to rural Evanston to discover as much of the truth as he could. All he had to start was the knowledge that the telephone number in his pocket belonged to his brother who had not heard from him since their mother's funeral 20 years before. Discovering Evanston, population 12,359, to be a stop for transients and truckers, Solomon's search for the elusive life of Gray led him to the small apartment complex known as 'The Classic Lodge'. It was here that Solomon found Gray had no friends, only neighbors, some of whom lived next door to him for a decade, but frustratingly knew almost nothing about his life, let alone the fact he was heir to a multi-million fortune. Paranoid: Rick Sathers had sporadic interactions with Gray and described him as paranoid, often whispering in conversations, 'He was kinda spooky, and he'd come in at odd hours, but he'd never do anything to hurt anyone. Speaking to George Riker, the owner of 'The Classic Lodge', Solomon discovered that the mining and copper heir had in fact left his apartment nine months before his death to live his life as a homeless hermit. 'Tim lived here since 2002, before he went off on his Howard Hughes phase,' said Riker. 'He only ever talked to me and my son. Never did I see him talk to anyone else. He was a complete loner. But sometimes we'd shoot the breeze or talk mechanics.' Gaining access into Gray's still relatively well-preserved apartment, Solomon found that Gray had been hoarding scrap metal and had seemingly become obsessed with building or designing experimental aircraft - just like Howard Hughes. Hoarder:  Inside Gray's old apartment in the Classic Lodge, where . he had been hoarding copper and aluminum scrap metal.  'Ryan and I . spent days cleaning it out'', said George. 'It was piled up to the . ceiling. We hauled off two truckloads.  Lucky it didn't collapse the . damn floor.' As he looked at the addresses on unopened letters, the photographer found that Gray had been renting an office in town for the past ten years too. The 40-page settlement that was accepted in Manhattan's Surrogate's Court  in September combines elements from Huguette Clark's two wills from 2005 and includes:$34.5 million for Clark's relatives - many of whom had never met the heiress . $11.5 million for the relatives' legal fees . $85 million home in Santa Barbara, California and Clark's art collection to be controlled by an arts foundation, the Bellosguardo Foundation, which was set up by the will . $4.5 million cash for the art foundation . $1.7 million doll collection for the art foundation . $3.5 million for Clark's goddaughter, Wanda Styka, who wrote to her throughout her life . $10 million for the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. $1 million for the Beth Israel Medical Center, where Clark lived for 20 years . $0 for Hadassah Peri, the private nurse who had originally been in line for $30 million. She must also pay back $5 million in gifts . $0 for Clark's attorney, Wallace Bock, and her accountant, Irving Kamsler, who had been in line for $500,000 . Rick Sathers the owner, also told a similar tale of a loner, with no friends, who while not threatening was certainly eccentric, to say the least. 'He was fastidious. Never missed a payment. I think he mostly used it as a place to have mail sent, but for a time he was doing work,' said Sathers. 'Something with computers and voice recognition, and I remember when he found out someone else had already done it, he was upset, because his plan was to be first in that.' Rick described him to Solomon as . paranoid, often whispering in conversations, 'He was kinda spooky, and . he'd come in at odd hours, but he'd never do anything to hurt . anyone...There used to be AA meetings in the basement here. 'I think that's why he wanted this office. I also know he sponsored some kids in Africa, maybe Sudan.' It is still unknown where and how Gray accessed or indeed got his money from. No . bank accounts have been found and the source of the $54,000 check to . cash found in his pocket has never been properly accounted for. George . Riker believed that his obsession with collecting scrap metal holds the . deepest fascination for him now he knows who his reclusive tenant . really was. Gray was . the great-grandson of former U.S. Senator William Andrews Clark, who . made his reputation as one of the copper kings of Montana, who also . diversified into banking, building, railroads and reserves special fame . as the founder of Las Vegas. Since . the death of Hugette Clark in 2011 and left all her money to doctors . and nurses, the remnants of her family have been fighting in the courts . to claim what they believe to be their fair share. In . her will, Huguette Clak bequeathed no money at all to her family, . leaving it all instead to her nurse, goddaughter, attorney, accountant, . hospital, doctor, favourite museum and various employees and an art . foundation she wanted established at her oceanfront estate in Santa . Barbara, California. It . is thought that not one of her relatives had seen her in 40 years, . although some had tried to keep contact with her through holiday cards . and the occasional phone calls. Because they did not receive a penny . in her will, 19 of Clark's relatives stepped forward to challenge her . will in a New York court. A . public administrator joined in on behalf of Gray who lawyers had tried . to contact about the battle, but all they could find were belongings . abandoned in a storage locker - private investigators were not able to . find him. Indeed, even . if investigators could not contact Gray and he had been granted a share . of the massive inheritance, his spouse or children would have been . entitled to it - however he had no wife or kids. A homeless Vietnam vet in Evanston who encountered Timothy several times but asked not to be named. In between quotes from Hunter S. Thompson, he described meeting Timothy in the fall under the same bridge where he was later found dead. 'Tim was already there, and he wasn't very welcoming, so I went elsewhere.' In September of this year, members of the family eventually won $34.5 million after the lengthy legal battle concluded. 'I got the impression Tim resented the family…thought they'd squandered the money. I think he was ashamed.', says Riker. What is known is Gray left 'The Classic Lodge' to live under the railway overpass where he eventually was found dead by Kaiden, 13 and his sister Amber, 10. A Vietnam veteran who also calls the bridge home told Solomon that he ran into Gray a couple of times over the last few months of his life. 'I never saw him rise from his bedroll; I wasn't sure he could even stand up. 'I tried once to bring him some clothes, and it was like 'he wanted them but didn't want them'…On Thanksgiving I tried to get him to come get a hot meal in town, but he wouldn't budge. 'I eventually asked if he intended to stay under that bridge all winter, and he said to me, 'that wouldn't be practical.' Wealthy: Huguette Clark left an estate valued at $306.5million when she died last year and (right) pictured with her father, industrialist and senator William Clark and her sister (far right) Last year, Gray's older brother, Jerry, said that Tim had worked as a cowboy and lived in the Rocky Mountain states most of his life. 'He was homeless essentially,' said Jerry to NBC News. 'If we had proper mental health services in this country, we could have notified and known to do something.' That rang true with Riker who said that 'Tim had equestrian knowledge, which was funny because my wife at the time worked on horses. He knew Shania Twain had Tennessee Walkers.  He knew Patrick Swayze had Arabian Horses.' Intriguingly, Solomon found a strong independent streak ran through everything he discovered Gray had done in Evanston. People who spoke to him around town described a man who admired the book 'Into the Wild' about  Christopher McCandless and his adventure's in Alaska. Ultimately, Solomon found Gray to be just as enigmatic as his relative Huguette Clark.","Timothy Henry Gray, 60, was the long-lost relative of New York heiress Huguette Clark who died in 2011 leaving a $300 million will .

Her body is so perfectly  preserved that it is hard to believe this girl died more than 500 years ago. But what is even more remarkable is that scientists today have been able to learn the secrets of her death – by analysing her hair. The 13-year-old Incan girl was heavily dosed with alcohol and  coca leaves, which form the basis of cocaine, before being left to die of exposure high in the Andes as a sacrifice. Scroll down for video . The children included a 13-year-old known as the 'Llullaillaco Maiden' whose remains were struck by lightning and charred. She was well fed and chosen for her beauty and possibly nobility . Axial radiograph of the interior of the mouth, showing the coca (green) held between the teeth. Coca and alcohol were substances that induced altered states interpreted as sacred and which could suggest to victims and those associated with them the proximity of the divine beings . 3D visualisations of the Maiden's cranium (yellow), teeth (orange), tongue (red) and the coca (green). The Maiden had pieces of coca leaves on her mouth . Capacocha was a ritual that took place upon the death of an Inca king. The local lords were required to select unblemished children representing the ideal of human perfection. Children were married and presented with sets of miniature human and llama figurines in gold, silver, copper and shell. The male figures have elongated earlobes and a braided headband and the female figurines wore their hair in plaited. The children were then returned to their original communities, where they were honoured before being sacrificed to the mountain gods on the Llullaillaco Volcano (pictured). Known as the Ice Maiden, she is one of three children found in stone tombs on a mountain in Argentina. The girl, the eldest of the three, was found cross-legged, with her head slumped forward and her hands resting in her lap. She wore a feather headdress over her tightly braided hair and there . were coca leaves between her teeth and balled up behind her cheek. The children were discovered in 1999. They are believed to have been . sacrificed in a ceremony called capacocha, a ritual thought to have been . used to instil fear and help control members of the rapidly expanding . Inca empire. Analysis  of the children’s hair, which still contains a . chemical fingerprint of their diet, shows that all three were plied with . drugs and alcohol to subdue them in the months before they died. Amounts were particularly high in the 13-year-old girl, perhaps because . she showed more resistance. The chemical analysis was carried out by . researchers at the University of Bradford, and published in the journal . Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The researchers said the coca leaves, which release a mild stimulant . when chewed and sucked, would have helped her cope with the demands of . altitude. The three Children of Llullaillaco, who were deep frozen rather than embalmed, were also found with an extraordinary collection of elaborate gold, silver and shell statues, textiles and pots containing food . The trio - whose selection was a great honour - were brought to the summit of Mount Llullaillco in the Andes which lies near the Chilean border where they were put to death in a ritual called capacocha . The older girl's face - which showed red ochre markings - was creased from the place it rested on her shawl . The chicha, an alcoholic drink made from fermented maize, would have . helped her deal with the cold. But it could also have hastened her . death by stopping her from shivering. There is no evidence that the girl, known as the Llullaillaco Maiden . after the mountain in northwest Argentina, was brutally killed. Instead, it is thought she died of exposure. Priests would have waited . for her to fall unconscious before placing her in a burial chamber. Dr Andrew Wilson, from the University of Bradford, said: ‘We think it . likely that the Maiden was selected for sacrifice 12 months before her . death, after which her treatment changed, corresponding to the sharp . rise in coca consumption. ‘She was then probably involved in a series of rituals, involving . consumption of coca and alcohol in the build up to her sacrifice. ‘Both substances were controlled, were considered elite products. ‘The fact that in her final weeks the maiden shows consistently higher . levels of coca and alcohol use compared to the younger children suggests . there was a greater need to sedate her in the final weeks of life.’","Archaeologists discover traces of coca leaves and beer in Incan mummies .

Combining a dozen each of red, green and blue filter images the computer science graduate created the stunning mosaic. Scroll down for video . Stunning new view of Saturn created by amateur image processor Gordan Ugarkovic . The aspiring astrophotographer from Croatia used red, green and blue filters to create the series of images . Emily Lakdawalla from the Planetary Society said: 'This mosaic showing the flattened globe of Saturn floating amongst the complete disk of its rings must surely be counted among the great images of the Cassini mission' The amateur astrophotographer, who lists Zagreb as his location on his Flickr site, said on his profile: 'I'm a guy who does programming for a living, have a degree in computer science, but in free time I like to fool around with image processing. 'Currently my top choice of images to play with is the Cassini/Huygens missions to Saturn and Titan.' Introducing the images on his page, he added: 'The images you see here are (more or . less) calibrated images that were released to the Planetary Data System (PDS), . they are not raw jpeg processed images that immediately appear on the . mission website as they're down linked from the spacecraft. 'I hope you find at least some of them interesting.' NASA's Cassini spacecraft was launched in 1997. Following the completion of a successful four-year mission in June 2008, an extension means it will orbit Saturn, captured above by the craft in 2005, until 2017 . Emily Lakdawalla from the Planetary Society - the largest nonprofit organisation promoting the exploration of space - who spotted the images on Mr Ugarkovic's Flickr stream, told NBC: 'I try to be measured in my praise for spacecraft images. 'But this enormous mosaic showing the flattened globe of Saturn floating amongst the complete disk of its rings must surely be counted among the great images of the Cassini mission.'

It's first four-year mission was successfully completed in June 2008 prompting a series of extensions, which will keep the craft orbiting Saturn and its moons until 2017. Among the missions' most important focus is a study of the ringed planet's moons Titan and Enceladus, as well as some of Saturn's other icy moons. Towards the end of the mission the study is expected to shift focus diving between the planet and its nine continuous rings and three discontinuous arcs, to gather information about the gas giant. Another image of the ringed planet captured by NASA's Cassini spacecraft . Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and second largest in the Solar System after Jupiter. The planet was named after the Roman god who also lends his name to Saturday. The gas giant has an average radius about nine times that of Earth. While just one-eighth the average density of Earth, its larger volume means Saturn is more than 95 times bigger than Earth. The . planet's interior is thought to be composed of a core of iron, nickel . and rock surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an . intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium and an outer . gaseous layer. The planet exhibits a pale yellow hue as a result of the ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,100mph - faster than those on Jupiter but slower than on Neptune. The prominent ring system feature nine continuous main rings and three discontinuous arcs. They are composed mainly of ice particles with a small amount of rocky debris and dust.

'While lying unconscious, an unknown number of suspects stole his iPhone, wallet and cigarettes. 'Anyone who witnessed the robbery is asked to contact officers in Southwark via 101.'

Malaysian student Ashraf Rossli was targeted by two groups of thieves during the London riots last summer . Twenty-year-old Ashraf Rossli was seriously injured when he was attacked in Barking, east London, by a thief who stole his bicycle. The student from Kuala Lumpar was then approached by a gang of yobs who, while pretending to help him, stole the contents of his rucksack. The incident sparked public outrage, with video footage of the robbery circulating for months afterwards. A 17-year-old boy was found guilty of grievous bodily harm and theft in March.","He was robbed after being knocked off his bicycle by a car .

"By . Emma Thomas . PUBLISHED: . 06:25 EST, 31 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:13 EST, 31 October 2013 . Children could be given the right to end their own lives in Belgium as the government considers new euthanasia laws. Euthanasia is already legal for people over the age of 18 in the country and now it may be extended to cover children which is something no other country has done. The same bill would offer the right to die to adults with early dementia. New law: Euthanasia is already legal for people over the age of 18 in the country and now it may be extended to cover children (picture posed by models) Advocates argue that euthanasia for children, with the consent of their parents, is necessary to give families an option in a desperately painful situation. But opponents have questioned whether children can reasonably decide to end their own lives. Belgium is already a euthanasia pioneer and it legalized the practice for adults in 2002. In the last decade, the number of reported cases per year has risen from 235 deaths in 2003 to 1,432 in 2012, the last year for which statistics are available. Doctors typically give patients a powerful sedative before injecting another drug to stop their heart. Only a few countries across the globe have legalised euthanasia. In the Netherlands, euthanasia is legal under specific circumstances and for children over the age of 12 with parental consent. There is an understanding that infants, too, can be euthanized, and that doctors will not be prosecuted if they act appropriately. Elsewhere in Europe, euthanasia is only legal in Luxembourg. Assisted suicide, where doctors help a patient to die but do not actively kill them, is allowed in Switzerland. In the US, the state of Oregon also grants assisted suicide requests for residents aged 18 or over with a terminal illness. Controversial: The Dignitas Clinic in Switzerland. Elsewhere in Europe, euthanasia is only legal in Luxembourg. Assisted suicide, where doctors help a patient to die but do not actively kill them, is allowed in Switzerland . Belgium's ruling Socialist party has proposed the bill expanding the right of euthanasia. The Christian Democratic Flemish party vowed to oppose the legislation and if it passes they say they will challenge it in the European Court of Human Rights. A final decision must be approved by Parliament and could take months. In the meantime, the Senate has heard testimony on both sides of the issue. 'It is strange that minors are considered legally incompetent in key areas, such as getting married, but might (be able) to decide to die,' Catholic Archbishop Andre-Joseph Leonard testified. Mr Leonard said alternatives like palliative sedation make euthanasia unnecessary - and relieves doctors of the burden of having to kill patients. In palliative sedation, patients are sedated and life-sustaining support is withdrawn so they starve to death; the process can take days. The debate has extended to medical ethicists and professionals far from Belgium. Charles Foster, who teaches medical law and ethics at Oxford University, believes children couldn't possibly have the capacity to make an informed decision about euthanasia since even adults struggle with the concept. 'It often happens that when people get into the circumstances they had so feared earlier, they manage to cling on all the more,' he said.'Children, like everyone else, may not be able to anticipate how much they will value their lives if they were not killed.' There are others, though, who argue that because Belgium has already approved euthanasia for adults, it is unjust to deny it to children. 'The principle of euthanasia for children sounds shocking at first, but it's motivated by compassion and protection,' said John Harris, a professor of bioethics at the University of Manchester. 'It's unfair to provide euthanasia differentially to some citizens and not to others if the need is equal.' Opposition: The Christian Democratic Flemish party vowed to oppose the legislation and if it passes they say they will challenge it in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg (pictured) Dr. Gerlant van Berlaer, a pediatric oncologist at the Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussels hospital, says the changes would legalize what is already happening informally. He said cases of euthanasia in children are rare and estimates about 10 to 100 cases in Belgium every year might qualify. 'Children have different ways of asking for things but they face the same questions as adults when they're terminally sick,' van Berlaer said. 'Sometimes it's a sister who tells us her brother doesn't want to go back to the hospital and is asking for a solution,' he said. 'Today if these families find themselves (in that situation), we're not able to help them, except in dark and questionable ways.' The change in the law regarding people with dementia is also controversial. People now can make a written declaration they wish to be euthanized if their health deteriorates, but the request is only valid for five years and they must be in an irreversible coma. The new proposal would abolish the time limit and the requirement the patient be in a coma, making it possible for someone who is diagnosed with Alzheimer's to be put to death years later in the future. ""They may turn into different people and may not have the same feelings about wanting to die as when they were fully competent"" In the Netherlands, guidelines allow doctors to euthanize dementia patients on this basis if they believe the person is experiencing 'unbearable suffering,' but few are done in practice. Dr Patrick Cras, a neurologist at the University of Antwerp, said people with dementia often change their minds about wanting to die. 'They may turn into different people and may not have the same feelings about wanting to die as when they were fully competent' he said. 'I don't see myself killing another person if he or she isn't really aware of exactly what's happening simply on the basis of a previous written request (to have euthanasia). I haven't fully made up my mind but I think this is going too far.' Penney Lewis, a professor and medical law expert at King's College London, agreed that carrying out euthanasia requests on people with dementia once they start to worsen could be legally questionable. 'But if you don't let people make decisions that will be respected in the future, including euthanasia, what you do is encourage people to take their own life while they have the capacity or to seek euthanasia much earlier,' she said. In the past year, several cases of Belgians who weren't terminally ill but were euthanized - including a pair of 43-year-old deaf twins who were going blind and a patient in a botched sex change operation - have raised concerns the country is becoming too willing to euthanize its citizens. 'People elsewhere in Europe are focused on assisted dying for the terminally ill and they are running away from what's happening in Belgium,' Ms Lewis said. 'If the Belgian statutes go ahead, this will be a key boundary that is crossed.'","Belgium made adult euthanasia legal in 2002 .

The only Muslim member of the English Defence League has been fined by magistrates after becoming embroiled in an argument with Asian men. Abdul Rafiq admitted using threatening language to cause harassment, alarm or distress at the demonstration in Bradford, West Yorkshire, on October 12. The 43-year-old from Glasgow described himself as an 'outcast' after recieving the fine at Leeds Magistrates' Court today, claiming 'the Muslim community does not like me for my EDL membership'. Abdul Rafiq was arrested by police at the demonstration in Bradford on October 12 after becoming involved in an argument with Asian men . The court heard how Rafiq claimed to have been threatened by 10 Asian men at the rally before launching into a tirade of swearing. Prosecuting Mike Vittis said the man tried pulling a union flag from his bag before being ushered away from the scene by police. Speaking after the case, Rafiq, whose parents moved from Pakistan to Scotland in the 1960s said: 'I got off the train and a group of Muslims started calling me a traitor. 'I told them I love my country and I pulled out the Union Flag. 'A police officer said my actions were inflammatory but I'm a very passionate person and I was just defending my country.' The 43-year-old from Glasgow claimed the men called him a traitor for being a member of the controversial group . Though Rafiq has never experienced racism at the hands of EDL members, he recognises there may be some prejudice within the organisation. 'I think we should have Muslims and people of all types in our group, maybe we should change the name,' he said. 'I am an active pro-unionist. Ever since I was a kid I loved the Union Jack. I love living in the UK but a lot of people take it for granted. 'All I want to do is make the world a better place and where better to start than your own country.' He was fined £110 after admitting the . public order offence, and must also pay a victim surcharge of £20 in . addition to a contribution to prosecution costs of £85. Speaking of the court's decision he . said: 'I am really pleased that I can carry on with my work for the EDL. I am going to try and recruit more Muslims to the cause.' 'I suppose this shows that the justice system does at least have some common sense.' Rafiq, who has eight brothers and sisters, claimed he has been shunned by his family for his involvement with the controversial group. 'I cannot go to Muslim areas any more and I get death threats online,' said the man who attended his first EDL event in 2009. Rafiq described how members at the demonstration in Manchester Piccadilly patted him on the back as though he were a 'hero'. 'The EDL members were chanting things like ""Muslim bombers off our streets"" but nobody gave me any trouble. 'Then there was this guy who was . selling union flags. I went up to him and asked for one and he didn’t . stop me so I bought one from him. The 43-year-old was happy with the court's decision and is eager to recruit more Muslims 'to the cause' of the English Defence League . The English Defence League (pictured here at a demonstration in 2009) have been described as Islamophobic by critics . 'Within a few moments I had people all . around me patting me on the back. They saw me as a breakthrough, I was . like a hero and it was all over the Internet within a few hours.' 'The EDL always tell me to bring more Muslims along. I have never found them to be racist.

'I tell them that it is not an English flag - it is a British flag.' Rafiq decided to join the league, which has been described by critics as Islamophobic, in the wake of terrorist attacks in the UK. 'After the 7/7 bombings, Glasgow airport and the death of soldier Lee Rigby - it all made me feel sick.

The man behind IBM's first ever personal computer, which sold out in stores in 1981 for $1,565, has died at the age of 72. William C. Lowe died of a heart attack on October 19 in Illinois, his daughter Michelle Marshall confirmed. Marshall said she didn't realize the magnitude of what her father helped accomplish until she was an adult. William C. Lowe (pictured in 1987 with an IBM computer) died of a heart attack in Illinois at age 72 . Lowe had a bold idea in 1980 - that IBM should develop a personal computer that could be mass marketed, expanding the company's reach beyond businesses and into people's homes. One year later, the IBM 5150 personal computer was selling out at stores for $1,565, not including a monitor. Lowe, who grew up in Pennsylvania and joined IMB in 1962, was credited with fostering collaboration within the computer industry. His daughter said of her father yesterday: 'I'm so incredibly proud of him ... he's touched everything,' 'If he hadn't taken a risk and had the chutzpah he did to make it happen, it could have taken so many more years before everyone had a computer on their desktop.' Other companies were making PCs as early as the 1970s, but IBM was behind the curve. Lowe was a lab director when he convinced his bosses that he could assemble a team to build a personal computer in a year. The IBM personal computer introduced in 1984 was a massive hit and changed society . Lowe and his team were able to develop the IBM PC so quickly by adopting open architecture — using parts and software from outside vendors, including Microsoft, according to IBM's website. Despite his accomplishments, Marshall said, her father didn't really learn how to use a PC until he left IBM and was working at Xerox. 'He was a slow adapter, but he understood the implication,' she said. A sports nut, her dad approached everything as a game. 'He would tackle it; he was relentless,' she said. She said her father grew up poor in Pennsylvania and was the first person in his family to go to college. Lowe joined IBM in 1962, when he finished college with a physics degree. He went on to serve as an IBM vice president and president of its entry systems division, which oversaw the development and manufacturing of IBM's personal computers and other businesses. He left the company in 1988 to work for Xerox, and later became president of Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. Messages left for IBM spokespeople weren't returned. Lowe also is survived by wife, Cristina Lowe, four other children — Julie Kremer, James Lowe, Gabriela Lowe and William Daniel Lowe — and 10 grandchildren.","Lowe joined IBM in 1962, when he finished college with a physics degree .

"By . Jason Groves, Chief Political Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 20:36 EST, 27 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:36 EST, 28 October 2013 . Sir David Nicholson: His successor Simon Stevens, incoming head of the NHS has a agreed to a 10 per cent pay cut to set an example to other managers . Health chiefs have been ordered to crack down on ‘unacceptable’ fat-cat pay in the NHS. In a stinging letter, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told them last night it was time for a ‘collective reality check’ on the highest salaries. He urged them to ‘show leadership by controlling pay among our most senior managers’. And he warned that the sight of managers being handed lavish salaries while ordinary NHS workers are subjected to years of pay restraint risked ‘damaging public confidence’. Mr Hunt said the pay of senior managers ‘should be subject to significantly greater restraint than that experienced by frontline NHS staff’. In future, health bodies wanting to pay someone more than £100,000 will first have to get the Health Secretary’s permission. Mr Hunt also plans to cap the number of managers on six-figure salaries. Health bosses have been told to conduct a pay audit to establish how many NHS managers are being paid more than £100,000. And, in a move that could prompt legal action from some managers, Mr Hunt plans to rewrite contracts to cap the level of pay-offs and end the ‘revolving door’, where senior managers can be paid off by one part of the NHS, only to take up a new post elsewhere shortly afterwards. The pay controls will directly affect the eight quangos that oversee the running of the NHS. Between them they employ thousands of staff. A source said Mr Hunt had been moved to act after it was revealed that 48 NHS quango staff are paid more than the Prime Minister. The new edict will also be rolled out to hospitals, although it will not apply to clinical staff such as senior consultants. The health service regulator Monitor and the NHS Trust Development Authority will write to all foundation hospitals and health trusts asking them to ‘follow the lead... in applying restraint’. In his letter to health chiefs, Mr Hunt said it was ‘vital that we stay in tune with the public mood’ on top pay in the public sector. ‘I am concerned that the number of people on salaries higher than the Prime Minister has become too high across the NHS,’ he said . ‘This is unacceptable and unjustified at a time when significantly lower-paid frontline staff are faced with below inflation pay increases. ‘I believe that it is time for a collective reality check – we must not develop a culture where very high pay is normalised. I do not want the NHS to make the same mistakes as the BBC, where a culture of excessive pay and pay-offs was tolerated for too long and damaged public confidence.’ A Government source pointed to the example set last week by Simon Stevens, incoming head of NHS England. Mr Stevens, who will replace Sir David Nicholson in April, has agreed to take a 10 per cent salary cut in his first year. It means he will be paid £189,900, compared with the £211,000 of his controversial predecessor. Time for a reality check: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has ordered a crack down on what he has branded 'unacceptable' pay-offs and salaries handed out to senior managers . The NHS has spent £1.4billion on redundancies since 2010 and in the past year more than 950 staff were given six-figure redundancy packages . The reforms will also create tough rules on pay-offs to senior NHS managers. The NHS has spent £1.4billion on redundancies since 2010 and in the past year more than 950 staff were given six-figure redundancy packages, up from 620 the previous year. A National Audit Office report into the shake-up of NHS England found that 44 ‘very senior managers’ who were laid off received up to £578,470 in redundancy payments. The average was £277,273. Lax rules have also allowed hundreds of managers to walk into new NHS jobs weeks after pocketing huge pay-offs. Since May 2010, at least 2,200 staff – mostly bureaucrats – have been re-employed by a trust after taking redundancy. NHS managers who are made redundant receive one month’s pay for every year served, with the average payout since 2010 standing at £48,000. Under existing rules, NHS staff have to wait only four weeks after being paid off before they can take up a job with another part of the organisation. The new proposals mean managers will have to refund part of any pay-off if they take up another NHS job within 12 months. Pay-offs for senior staff will be limited, with the maximum salary used to calculate payments capped at £80,000. Employer top-ups to pensions, which are often used as a sweetener in redundancy deals, will also be limited. Controversially, Mr Hunt wants the new terms written into the contracts of existing staff.Decentralisation in the NHS means it is not possible for Mr Hunt to dictate salaries at individual hospitals. But the Government source said they would be expected to fall into line. ‘We want to change the culture across the NHS,’ the source said. ‘The letter has gone to the arms-length bodies we are directly responsible for. But I think hospitals will find it difficult not to act.’","Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told them last night it was time for a ‘collective reality check’ on the highest salaries .

Toronto Mayor Rob Ford is still rejecting calls for his resignation saying on Monday in his first public appearance since he admitted to smoking crack cocaine that he is ‘not going anywhere’. The embattled politician, who made the appearance at the city’s Remembrance Day ceremony in front of Old City Hall, was greeted with a mixture of light applause and booing when he made his speech to a crowd huddled under umbrellas. Ford admitted smoking crack cocaine last week in a ‘drunken stupor’, despite at first denying he had taken the drug. First appearance: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford makes his address during Remembrance Day ceremonies at Old City Hall in Toronto on Monday - his first appearance since he admitted to using crack cocaine . From left to right: NDP Leader Tom Mulclair, Minster of Transport Lisa Raitt and Toronto Mayor Rob Ford at the Remembrance Day ceremony. Ford has been asked to take a break while he deals with his drug issue . 'Yes I have smoked crack cocaine': Ford has admitted he took the substance but that he does not remember it as he was too drunk . Ford first faced allegations in May that he had been caught on video puffing from a glass crack pipe. On November 5 he finally admitted he had taken the drug . about a year ago, but was not an addict. He defied calls to quit, vowing to . run for re-election next year. ‘Yes, I have smoked crack cocaine,’ Ford said outside his office on November 5, according to BBC News. ‘There have been times when I've been in a drunken stupor. That's why I want to see the tape. ‘I . want everyone in the city to see this tape. I don't even recall there . being a tape or video. I want to see the state that I was in.’ Police confirmed a week prior to his confession that they had obtained a long-reported video that appears to show Ford using crack cocaine. During the Remembrance Day ceremony on Monday, Ford laid a wreath at the base of the cenotaph and shook hands with veterans in the crowd. The mayor was greeted with shouts of support and heckling as he walked through Nathan Phillips Square surrounded by a phalanx of City Hall security guards. ‘I'm not going anywhere, guaranteed,’ he told one supporter, according to the Toronto Sun. Ford's allies have been urging him to take a leave of absence to deal with his substance abuse issues, but he has so far resisted those calls. Ford ignored reporters' questions as he walked back into City Hall, including a question relating to his drug habit: ‘Rob, do you smoke your own pipe or do you use somebody's pipe?’ When he got back to City Hall, Ford greeted veterans in the rotunda and then disappeared into his office. Greeting the vets: Ford shakes hands with veterans at the ceremony, which attracted a large crowd, some of who booed him while he spoke . Swarmed: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford is surrounded by reporters as he heads back to City Hall after his speech. One asked him if he smokes from his own pipe or shares with others . On Wednesday, the Toronto city council will debate various motions relating to the crack cocaine scandal, including asking Ford to formally apologizing for lying about his drug use as well whether the mayor should take a leave of absence to get healthy. Councillors may ask the province to intervene and remove Ford if he won't step down, although that is unlikely, according to the Toronto Star. Councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong, who is putting forward one of those motions, believes Ford needs to take a break from city hall. 'He can't speak with any type of moral authority on the issue of crime and safety or about the issue of drug use. He talks about creating jobs.' Pressure: Councillors may ask the province to intervene and remove Ford if he won't step down . Not stepping down: Ford guarantees his supporters that he's 'not going anywhere' These issues will be debated at the . meeting and Ford will take questions from councillors — settling the . stage for one of the most heated council debates in Canada's recent . history. The explosive allegation had been . made public following the release of documents that form the basis of a . major drug investigation. Police . say they rummaged through the garbage of the major of Canada's largest . city and conducted an extensive surveillance operation to monitor him . and close friend Alexander Lisi. Lisis was Ford's sometime driver, who has been . charged with marijana trafficking and possession. While he denies the video exists, two reporters from the Toronto Star said they have seen it. Both . the Star and US website Gawker.com claimed they had been offered to buy . the video, which was taken on a cell phone and has not been released . publicly.

Toronto Mayor Rob Ford yells at reporters and photographers to get off of his property in front of his house in Toronto October 31, a week before he admitted to taking crack cocaine . Forensics have since the located a 'digital file' of the video from a hard drive after it had been deleted. Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair said the video is 'consistent with what had been previously described in various media reports'. 'I . think it’s fair to say the mayor does appear in that video but I’m not . going to get into the detail of what activities is depicted in that . video,' Chief Blair said in a news conference at a police headquarters. Chief Blair said he was 'disappointed' after viewing the video. In another twist, Lisi, already facing drug charges, has been taken into custody today and charged with extortion. Police said 'the accused made extortive efforts to retrieve a recording'. The . documents also show Ford receiving suspicious packages from Lisi on . several occasions, some which were caught on camera and released to the . media. Evidence: This widespread image of Rob Ford is allegedly connected to the crack video . Ford yells at reporters and photographers to get off of his property in front of his house in Toronto. Ford first denied the allegations, then finally admitted to it . 'Lisi approached the . driver's side of the Mayor's vehicle with a small white gift bag in . hand; he then walked around to the passenger side and got on board,' reads one document dated July 30, 2013. 'After a few minutes Lisi exited the Escalade empty handed and walked back to his Range Range Rover.' Another dated July 28 says Lisi 'constantly used counter surveillance techniques' when he met with Ford that day. On . August 13 documents say Lisi and Ford met and 'made their way into a . secluded area of the adjacent woods where they were obscured from . surveillance efforts and stayed for approximately one hour'. Police documented Lisi exchanging several phone calls with Ford, using . four different numbers to reach him. Starting August 7, . when police began tracking the phone numbers of calls to and from Lisi's . cellphone, until September 19, Ford and Lisi exchanged 349 phone calls. Ford recently vouched for Lisi in a separate criminal case, praising his leadership skills in a letter filed with the court. The letter was part of a report prepared by a probation officer after Lisi was convicted of threatening to kill a woman. Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair speaking at a news conference in Toronto, confirming police are in possession of the alleged video that reportedly depicts Toronto Mayor Rob Ford smoking crack cocaine . Ford angrily yelled at . reporters two weeks ago to get off his property during a heated exchange before . he left his house in the morning. He didn't respond to numerous questions about the allegations. Ford . said previously that he was shocked when Lisi was arrested earlier this . month, calling him a 'good guy' and saying he doesn't abandon his . friends.

A Chinese man suffered from extreme body odour for four years because his armpit hair had become infected. The 40-year-old went to his doctor complaining of the stench and having 'dirty' armpit hair, which stained his clothes during summer. This is because there were 'creamy, yellow' secretions on the hairs, according to the case report published in the New England Journal of Medicine. A Chinese man suffered from extreme body odour because his armpit hair had become infected. He went to his doctor complaining of 'dirty', smelly armpits, which had 'creamy, yellow' secretions on the hairs . When doctors looked at the hairs under a microscope, they could see the secretions were only on the hair shaft, rather than penetrating it. The man was diagnosed with trichomycosis axillaris - a bacterial infection caused by the overgrowth of corynebacterium. The yellow, creamy secretions consist of tightly . packed bacteria which prefer moist areas - hence why they gather in areas such as the armpit and groin. On closer inspection, 1-2 mm yellow, red or black nodules can also be found around the hair shaft, making the hair appear beaded or thicker. The rancid, acidic odour was caused by the bacteria metabolising testosterone - a hormone found in sweat - in sweat into pungent compounds, the researchers said.

Obesity, excessive sweating and poor hygiene also increase the risk of developing the condition. Treatment involved shaving the armpit hair off and an antibiotic cream and aluminum chloride being applied to the area, say the doctors at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing. Within a few weeks, the infection had cleared up and the condition does not have any long-lasting consequences.","The Chinese man went to his doctor .

'Sordid': Rachel Speed, 41, arrives at Cwmbran Magistrates Court for a hearing earlier in the year. She has now been found guilty at Cardiff Crown Court and faces jail . A teacher was in a 'sordid' lesbian relationship with one of her pupils for five years, which started when she kissed the girl in a stationery cupboard when she was only 14. Rachel Speed, 41, would pick the girl up in her car and drive her to her house, where they would have regular 'sleepovers'. The couple showered together and would perform sex acts, while the victim was dressed in a corset and PVC hotpants, a court heard. Speed, who had taught science at Fairview High School in Cwmbran, south Wales, for 15 years, carried on the relationship until the girl went to university. She was then dumped by text after her victim met somebody new. After they split up, she reported Speed to the police, who charged her with indecent assault and sexual activity while in a position of trust. She was found guilty by a jury at Cardiff Crown Court yesterday, and was told by the judge to expect a prison sentence. The girl's parents had found out about the relationship while it was happening, and made Speed promise to end it until their daughter was 21 years old. Despite promising to do so, Speed continued to see the girl for as long as possible, and gave her expensive gifts including a car and an engagement ring. Prosecutor Christopher Rees told her: 'You abused her trust while she was 14. 'You did not want her parents to know because then they would know your sordid little secret. 'You were clearly obsessed with her - even when she went to university.' Speed agreed she would end the relationship until she was 21 or after she finished full time education - but she broke her promise. The girl’s mother said: 'I felt sick and angry. My daughter was a child. How could she have her sleep over at her house?' Deceitful: Speed promised the victim's parents to stop their relationship, but continued it anyway until she was dumped . The court heard how the relationship was uncovered when the girl's mother found an 'inappropriate' letter from Speed. When they found out about the sleepovers, they went to Speed's house to collect items belonging to the victim. The court heard Speed, of Hengoed in the Rhymney Valley, South Wales told them: 'You're not going to like it but I love your daughter.' After the couple broke up, the victim . reported Speed, who was accused of indecent assault and sexual activity . while in a position of trust. 'Failure to protect': Speed began her relationship with the child while . she was a pupil at Fairview High School (pictured). Speed had worked . there for 15 years . Guilty: Speed, who is technically still employed by the school, will be sentenced in November . Speed denied the charges but was found guilty and warned she will be jailed next month. Judge David Wynn Morgan told Speed: 'Be under no illusions, the only issue is the length of the sentence rather than its nature.' Speed is still employed at Fairview High School in Cwmbran, near Newport, until the council chiefs can conclude a process to terminate her contract. A spokesman for Torfaen Council said: 'We apologise for the failure to protect this pupil during her time at the school.'","Rachel Speed taught science at Fairview High School in south Wales .

The FBI is investigating 14 Barclays traders at the heart of the Libor-fixing scandal, it emerged yesterday. Although much of the immediate political fallout over Barclays has occurred in the UK, the US could become the main legal arena for the scandal, with financial and custodial punishments dwarfing those imposed elsewhere. The City of Baltimore has already launched a class action suit and the brokerage firm Charles Schwab has brought a lawsuit in California. Probe: Fourteen Barclays traders at the heart of the Libor-fixing scandal are being investigated by the FBI (File photograph) The Schwab lawsuit, filed against several banks, including Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and RBS, indicates the scale of the scandal could be far bigger than first thought. The FBI investigation was announced by Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer. The 14 traders under scrutiny are believed to have been based mostly in London and New York. As part of a non-prosecution agreement last week, Barclays paid a record £59.5million to Britain’s Financial Services Authority, while American regulators and prosecutors took about £230million. The deal covers Barclays but not its current and former employees. Barclays has agreed to assist US investigators, essentially becoming a co-operating witness against some of its own people and rival banks. Mr Breuer noted last week that Barclays had ‘substantially assisted the Criminal Division in our ongoing investigation of individuals and other financial institutions in this matter’. Scrutiny: The FBI investigation was announced by Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer . President Barack Obama formed a Financial Fraud Enforcement taskforce in 2009 which, the US Department of Justice highlighted last week, was designed ‘to wage an aggressive, co-ordinated and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes’. The result could be extraditions of bankers to face US courts – even if the alleged criminal acts did not take place on American soil. A 23-page statement of facts regarding Barclays was drawn up by the Justice Department and posted on its website and that of the FBI. The document paints a picture of a network of traders conspiring on both sides of the Atlantic to manipulate both the Libor and Euribor rates. The document, in a statement of facts agreed to by Barclays, said ‘interbank communications’ included ‘ones in which certain Barclays swaps traders communicated with former Barclays swaps traders who had left Barclays and joined other financial institutions’. High stakes: A lawsuit has been filed in the US against several banks, including Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and RBS . According to the Schwab lawsuit, each bank ‘dramatically increased its collusive suppression of Libor’. It claims that ‘under-reporting of Libor had a $45billion (£28billion) effect on the market’ – a shortfall that the banks avoided paying to investors buying their financial products. Manipulating Libor would have had a significant effect on pension and investment funds that buy complex financial products, known as derivatives, linked to interest rates. At least 16 of the world’s biggest banks, including UBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, HSBC, RBS and Lloyds, are likely to be looked at by the FBI or other US federal agencies. As well as Britain and the US, investigations are taking place in other European countries, Japan, Canada and Singapore. Inquiries are centred around which banks participated in the alleged collusion and whether any criminal actions were authorised or condoned by senior figures. Canada’s Competition Bureau filed an affidavit against banks including HSBC and RBS, demanding emails and other documents. According to the affidavit, one bank became a whistleblower and agreed to assist the authorities. A trader at the whistleblower bank is alleged to have communicated with traders at HSBC, Deutsche Bank, RBS, JP Morgan and Citibank. Last week, Harvey Pitt, former chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, said Barclays’ actions over Libor were likely to be only ‘the proverbial tip of the iceberg’.

Police have confirmed they have obtained a long-reported video that appears to show Toronto Mayor Rob Ford using crack cocaine. The explosive allegation has been made public following the release of documents that form the basis of a major drug investigation. Police say they rummaged through the garbage of the major of Canada's largest city and conducted an extensive surveillance operation to monitor him and close friend Alexander Lisi, Ford's sometime driver, who has been charged with marijana trafficking and possession. Ford first faced allegations in May that he had been caught on video puffing from a glass crack pipe. While he denies the video exists, two reporters from the Toronto Star said they have seen it. Both the Star and US website Gawker.com claimed they had been offered to buy the video, which was taken on a cell phone and has not been released publicly. Police said Ford was put under surveillance after the allegations were made. Forensics have since the located a 'digital file' of the video from a hard drive after it had been deleted.

Ford denied allegations earlier this year that he was caught smoking crack cocaine on camera. Police have now confirmed the video exists . Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair said the video is 'consistent with what had been previously described in various media reports'. 'I think it’s fair to say the mayor does appear in that video but I’m not going to get into the detail of what activities is depicted in that video,' Chief Blair said in a news conference at a police headquarters. Chief Blair said he was 'disappointed' after viewing the video. In another twist, Lisi, already facing drug charges, has been taken into custody today and charged with extortion. Police said 'the accused made extortive efforts to retrieve a recording'. The documents also show Ford receiving suspicious packages from Lisi on several occasions, some which were caught on camera and released to the media. 'Lisi approached the driver's side of the Mayor's vehicle with a small white gift bag in hand; he then walked around to the passenger side and got on board,' reads one document dated July 30, 2013. 'After a few minutes Lisi exited the Escalade empty handed and walked back to his Range Range Rover.' Another dated July 28 says Lisi 'constantly used counter surveillance techniques' when he met with Ford that day. On August 13 documents say Lisi and Ford met and 'made their way into a secluded area of the adjacent woods where they were obscured from surveillance efforts and stayed for approximately one hour'. Police documented Lisi exchanging several phone calls with Ford, using . four different numbers to reach him. Starting Aug. 7, . when police began tracking the phone numbers of calls to and from Lisi's . cellphone, until Sept. 19, Ford and Lisi exchanged 349 phone calls. Ford recently vouched for Lisi in a separate criminal case, praising his leadership skills in a letter filed with the court. The letter was part of a report prepared by a probation officer after Lisi was convicted of threatening to kill a woman.

Swathes of the UK have been warned to expect flooding this weekend as mother nature unleashes a second barrage of stormy weather. The Met Office has issued a warning for southern England, alerting people to the risk of localised flooding today and on Sunday as heavy rain hits the coast. The areas caught in the eye of the powerful St Jude storm last Sunday and Monday are expected to once again bear the brunt of the bad weather - with close to one inch of rain predicted in the south east. The news comes as forecasters say that last month was one of the mildest Octobers on record and the seventh warmest in 100 years. Brewing: The iconic Brighton coastline including the West Pier, pictured, is battered by strong waves today . Braving the weather: Two people walk along Brighton's seafront and one struggles with her umbrella . Wet weekend: Heavy rain is expected in the south and eastern areas of the country, while 60mph winds are predicted in some areas of Wales . Many areas will see torrential downpours and high winds, which will continue tomorrow, with gusts of up to 60mph predicted in Wales. The stormy weather will strengthen on Sunday when the worst of the weather arrives and the risk of flooding will be at its highest following days of rain. There are fears the latest spell of disruptive weather will hamper recovery efforts following the impact of the worst storm in Britain for 26 years, which killed five people. Tim Fields of the Energy Networks Association said: 'A lot of the places that are still without power are quite remote, with small numbers of people where there are downed power lines. Predictions: The Met Office have warned of localised flooding today and on Sunday in southern England . Powerless: Monday's storm pulled down electricity lines, including the one pictured in Brentwood, Essex, leaving thousands of homes without power . 'All the network operators will be in close contact with the Met Office during the weekend and we hope to have everyone back on supply by the end of next week. 'Flooding does not normally present a huge threat to the energy infrastructure but extensive flooding would definitely pose a risk.' Billy Payne, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, said the latest spell of unwelcome weather will not be a repeat of last week’s powerful storm. 'It will not be welcomed but it is not expected to be anywhere near as bad as last week,' he said. Destruction: St Jude's storm, the worst to hit the UK in 26 years, pulled down this two-storey scaffolding in Leyton, east London, crushing cars and blocking 100m of road . 'It will still be windy but the main risk this weekend is of lots of heavy rain. 'On top of the rain we have already had it could lead to flash flooding, particularly on Sunday.' Gemma Plumb, also of the MeteoGroup, said November will bring 'drier and chillier weather as would be expected in November' while October was the mildest the UK has seen since 2006. The South West, south Wales and Midlands saw the highest above average temperatures, at 1.5C warmer than is usual for the month. But although it was milder than usual, it was also the least sunny October since 2005 and the wettest in England and Wales since 2000, Ms Plumb said.","Met Office issues warnings for London and southern and eastern counties .

Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal 'bad bank' to swallow £38billion of toxic loans and avoid being broken-up permanently, it was announced today. The ailing bank, which is 81 per cent owned by the taxpayer, says the decision would allow its 'good' parts to improve quicker as it was also forced to announce a sharp fall in profits this morning. Operating profits fell to £438million for the third quarter of 2013, down from £909million 12 months earlier, causing its share price to drop by 13p to £3.53 when the stock market opened this morning. The results are the first presented by RBS’s new boss, Ross McEwan, after he replaced Stephen Hester at the start of September. Changes: The Royal Bank of Scotland has today announced that it will not be split in two, instead creating an internal £38bn 'bad bank' The decision not not to fully split it into ‘good’ and ‘bad’ banks has been led by the Chancellor. George Osborne had been under pressure to do so to ensure the 'good' section to be privatised quickly. RBS's new focus will see it being a 'boost to the British economy instead of a burden', he said today. The bank has now been ordered to run-down its . problem loans via an internal company – mostly related to commercial property and the troubled . Irish business Ulster Bank. Bosses believes this will be simpler and help the bank recover quicker from is financial problems. Chief executive Ross McEwan has also started a full review of the lender which will report back in February, and is to speed up the sale of its Citizens US banking subsidiary, with a partial flotation next year. Mr McEwan said the plan will 'create a bank that can reward the faith of UK taxpayers and all our investors'. Bad news: New RBS chief executive Ross McEwan, who took over from Stephen Hester in September, announced a £500m drop in profits today - and said there would be further losses this year as they cope with toxic debt . RBS will make a substantial loss overall this year as the faster run-down of assets in the internal bad bank will cause an accounting write-down of up to £4.5billion. Loss: With the share price still £1.50 each below what the Government paid, RBS will be publicly owned for some time, George Osborne said today . And when including one-off items and an additional charge of £250 million to cover redress for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI), RBS made a bottom-line loss of £634 million in today's third quarter results. City experts also believe a full-blown . break up would have been a bad idea. Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec, . said: ‘I don’t know a single shareholder who thinks a break up is a . good idea.’ He also warned that RBS faces a mounting compensation bill . for mis-selling insurance alongside loans to small businesses. When the bank was bailed-out in 2008 the taxpayer paid £5 per share. The current price is around £3.53. Mr Osborne said he thought it was 'unlikely' that RBS could be sold off and returned to the private sector before the next general election in 2015. 'I think, sadly, it is still some way off,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'I think, quite frankly, it is unlikely before the general election. 'If there was a transformation in RBS and all these problems that it has to confront were dealt with much more quickly, maybe we would reconsider. But I say 'unlikely' in the real sense of the word, which is I don't think it's very likely.'","81 per cent state-owned bank decided against permanently splitting in two .

Plea deal: In exchange for a lighter sentence, Marcy Cruz testified in the case of two girls who were brutally beaten with a baseball bat in April 2010 in Chicago's Bucktown neighborhood . A key witness gave revealing testimony Monday in the shocking case of a foreign exchange student from Northern Ireland beaten within inches of her life during a Chicago robbery in 2010. Marcy Cruz detailed to the court what she saw the night Heriberto Viramontes is accused of brutally beating Natasha McShane and Stacy Jurich, both 27, leaving McShane paralyzed and unable to speak. 'He told me, ""Look at all these white ho's,"" that he wanted to rob one of them,' Cruz testified. According to the Chicago Tribune, . the former stripper and mother of two young children also testified . that Viramontes, 34, took a baseball bat from Cruz's van before . disappearing into the early morning darkness. She waited just long enough to listen to one song on the radio while she smoked some marijuana. When Viramonte returned, Cruz told the court that he carried with him two purses and told her to drive off. They divvied up the contents of the purse and Cruz took some Dior perfume and makeup. 'He stated that the girls were really pretty and that he did some bogus (stuff),' Cruz said. Prosecutors . say that 'bogus stuff' was what left McShane disabled for life and her . friend Jurich unable to ever forget what she saw. Cruz . said she'd met Viramontes through her boyfriend, though she admitted to . having had sex with him in the van that tragic April night before the . girls were beaten. Cruz testified that Heriberto Verimontes, left, said he wanted to beat some 'white ho's' and then left the car with a baseball bat. Prosecutors say that's when he brutally beat exchange student Natasha McShane and her friend . Family: Natasha McShane's father Liam, left, sister and brother arrive with other friends and family at the Leighton Criminal Court Building last Thursday . Emotional: The McShane's are in Chicago from Northern Ireland, where Natasha remains because she is unable to walk or talk or care for herself because of the attack . Cruz also . admitted to having falsified parts of the story to the police, but now . says she only did so to try and stay out of trouble. Earlier this year, she pleaded guilty to attempted murder and agreed to testify against Viramontes as part of a plea deal. Cruz was sentenced to 22 years. Last week Jurich sobbed on the . witness stand as she recounted the horrific beating she and Natasha . McShane, a Northern Irish exchange student, suffered in Bucktown in . Chicago three years ago. McShane, . who had been in Chicago for just three months at the time of the . attack, suffered the worst injuries and is now unable to walk or talk . and requires around-the-clock care. Victim: Natasha McShane, 27, is unable to walk or talk after she was brutally beaten with a baseball bat in Chicago in 2010. Her family have decided to keep her in the dark about her alleged attacker's trial . Painful memories: Stacy Jurich, center, leaves the Leighton Criminal Courts Building in Chicago on Wednesday after an emotional testimony. McShane's mother Sheila is seen at right . Jurich recalled in court how, after a night of dancing on April 23, 2010, they were walking through a lit viaduct when she was smacked across the back of her head, the Chicago Tribune reported. 'I heard my head being hit and felt . excruciating pain and sort of lost my equilibrium and just had this . taste in my mouth almost like a battery or metallic flavor,' Jurich . testified. Her skull was cracked open and she stumbled to see McShane being hit across the head with a bat. 'She went down immediately,' Jurich said. 'She just . lifelessly fell into the sidewalk.' The attacker then struck her again, she said, and called her a 'stupid b****' as he tore the women's purses from them and fled. Jurich cried as she looked at a photograph of the red jacket she used to try to stop the blood pouring from her friend's head. Scene: The women were walking beneath this viaduct after a night of dancing when they were attacked . 'The blood started coming out of her . head,' she explained. 'I took off my jacket and tried to support her . head as well as I could. Then I got up and ran for help.' McShane's family flew from Silverbridge in County Armagh, Northern Ireland for the trial. They . had previously said they were not going to tell their daughter about . the trial as they did not want to bring back painful memories. Her . mother Sheila testified about her daughter's devastating injuries - and . how she has changed from the vibrant, outgoing student to a woman . combined to a wheelchair and unable to speak. Sheila sometimes referred to her daughter in the past tense as she testified. Support: An image shows a get well soon card for Natasha at a fundraiser after the 2010 beating in Chicago . The jury was shown three videos of . McShane's daily struggles. One showed her struggling to drink from a cup . - using both of her hands and lowering her head to drink. Her parents must cut her food and she . is unable to tell them when she needs the bathroom. She has gained . weight because of her lack of mobility and can only say 'Sinn' - the . Gaelic word for 'we' or 'us'. Jurich . needed 15 staples in her head after the attack but has been able to . return to work. She testified that she is too frightened to drive after . losing her peripheral vision in the beating. Assistant State's Attorney Margaret . Ogarek said there was evidence tying Viramontes to the attack, such as . his fingerprints on McShane's bag which was later found at a gas . station. An alleged accomplice, Marcy . Cruz, 28, claimed that he had spoken about robbing someone that night . and after she parked the car, he jumped out before returning with the . two purses. But Viramontes' lawyer, Assistant Public Defender David Dunne, told jurors the attack was a tragedy but that his client had nothing to do with it. He said that Jurich had first called her attacker a black man but Viramontes is Hispanic. The trial, which continues on Thursday, had been delayed for three years due to legal wrangling over DNA evidence.","Natasha McShane and Stacy Jurich were brutally beaten with a baseball bat in April 2010 as they headed home after a night of dancing .

NASA is preparing to launch a 3-D printer into space next year, a toaster-sized game changer that greatly reduces the need for astronauts to load up with every tool, spare part or supply they might ever need. The printers would serve as a flying factory of infinite designs, creating objects by extruding layer upon layer of plastic from long strands coiled around large spools. Doctors use them to make replacement joints and artists use them to build exquisite jewelry. In NASA labs, engineers are 3-D printing small satellites that could shoot out of the Space Station and transmit data to earth, as well as replacement parts and rocket pieces that can survive extreme temperatures. Made in space: Project manager Matthew Napoli, left, and director of research and development Michael Snyder test a 3D printer which will eventually be used in space . ‘Any time we realize we can 3-D print something in space, it's like Christmas,’ said inventor Andrew Filo, who is consulting with NASA on the project. ‘You can get rid of concepts like rationing, scarce or irreplaceable.’ The spools of plastic could eventually replace racks of extra instruments and hardware, although the upcoming mission is just a demonstration printing job. ‘If you want to be adaptable, you have to be able to design and manufacture on the fly, and that's where 3-D printing in space comes in,’ said Dave Korsmeyer, director of engineering at NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, about 35 miles south of San Francisco. For the first 3-D printer in space test slated for fall 2014, NASA had more than a dozen machines to choose from, ranging from $300 desktop models to $500,000 warehouse builders. Test run: Tools and parts made by a 3D printer are displayed. One of the biggest obstacles to space exploration is that you need to bring everything with you including tools, equipment, spare parts and satellites . All of them, however, were built for use on Earth, and space travel presented challenges, from the loads and vibrations of launch to the stresses of working in orbit, including microgravity, differing air pressures, limited power and variable temperatures. As a result, NASA hired Silicon Valley startup Made In Space to build something entirely new. ‘Imagine an astronaut needing to make a life-or-death repair on the International Space Station,’ said Aaron Kemmer, CEO of Made in Space. ‘Rather than hoping that the necessary parts and tools are on the station already, what if the parts could be 3-D printed when they needed them?’ When staffing his start up in 2010, Kemmer and his partners warned engineers there would be ups and downs - nauseating ones. In more than a dozen flights in NASA's ‘vomit comet’ reduced-gravity aircraft, Made In Space scientists tested printer after printer. Ready for launch: Aaron Kemmer, CEO and co-founder of Made in Space, looks through some items. Specialized 3D printers would allow astronauts to produce the things they need on-demand when they're in space, allowing them to travel farther from the Earth . Last week at their headquarters on NASA's campus, Made In Space engineers in lab coats and hair nets tinkered with a sealed 3-D printer in a dust free cleanroom, preparing the models for further pre-launch tests. As proof of its utility, the team revisited the notorious 1970 moon-bound Apollo 13 breakdown, when astronauts were forced to jerry-rig a lifesaving carbon dioxide filter holder with a plastic bag, a manual cover and duct tape. A 3-D printer could have solved the problem in minutes. ‘Safety has been one of our biggest concerns,’ said strategic officer Michael Chen. Sparks, breakages and electric surges can have grave consequences in the space station. ‘But when we get it right, we believe these are the only way to manifest living in space,’ he said. Space-bound printers will also, eventually, need to capture gasses emitted from the extruded plastics, be able to print their own parts for self-repairs and have some abilities to recycle printed products into new ones. Scott Crump, who helped develop 3-D printing technology in 1988 by making a toy frog for his daughter with a glue gun in his kitchen, said he never conceived how pivotal it could be for space travel. But he said that until metal becomes commonly used in 3-D printers, the applications will be limited. ‘The good news is that you don't have to have this huge amount of inventory in space, but the bad news is now you need materials, in this case filament, and a lot of power,’ he said. NASA and other international space agencies are pressing forward with 3-D printing. Mastering space manufacturing, along with finding and producing water and food on the moon or other planets, could lead to living on space. Last month, the space agency awarded Bothell, Wash.-based Tethers Unlimited $500,000 toward a project to use 3-D printing and robots to build massive antennas and solar power generators in space by 2020. It replaces the expensive and cumbersome process of building foldable parts on Earth and assembling them in orbit. For Made In Space's debut, when it's shuttled up to the space station aboard a spaceflight cargo resupply mission, the initial prints will be tests - different small shapes to be studied for strength and accuracy. They're also discussing with NASA about what the first real piece that they should print will be. Whatever it is, it will be a historic and symbolic item sure to end up in a museum someday. ‘It's not something we're discussing publicly right now,’ said CEO Kemmer. Then, Jason Dunn, the chief technology officer, beckoned, dropping his voice as he grinned. ‘We're going to build a Death Star,’ he joked softly, referring to the giant space station in the ‘Star Wars’ movies that could blow up planets. ‘Then it's all going to be over.’","NASA plans to launch a 3-D printer to the International Space Station .

"By . Ryan Kisiel and Stephen Wright . PUBLISHED: . 06:03 EST, 26 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:04 EST, 26 July 2013 . Disgraced BBC presenter Stuart Hall had his prison sentence for a series of sex assaults on girls doubled yesterday. Three Appeal Court judges ruled that his original 15-month term was ‘inadequate’ and should be increased to 30 months. The former It’s A Knockout host, 83, was told that he will not be eligible for release until September next year. Guilty: Hall had 'got away' with his crimes for years because of his celebrity status, judges said today . Jailed: Although Stuart Hall is currently serving time in prison, appeal judges ruled today that his sentence was 'unduly lenient' 'Unduly lenient': Attorney General Dominic . Grieve (left) said the original 15-month sentence handed to Hall by Judge Anthony Russell . QC (right) did not reflect the seriousness of his crimes . Hall, a married father-of-two, had admitted sexually assaulting 13 girls aged nine to 17 over nearly 20 years. His . initial sentence handed down last month was heavily criticised by his . victims, child protection campaigners and senior politicians. After . receiving numerous complaints, Attorney General Dominic Grieve . concluded that the punishment was ‘unduly lenient’ and referred the case . to the Court of Appeal. Yesterday, three judges led by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge, agreed that Hall should have been jailed for longer. In . a withering judgment, they  condemned the paedophile’s original public . denials of the sex allegations that had been made against him. Increase: Hall was given a 15-month prison sentence at Preston Crown Court but this was doubled by Court of Appeal judges . Court appearances: The television presenter initially strongly denied the charges, before pleading guilty . As . Hall watched glum-faced via a video link from Preston Prison, Lord Judge . said the court regarded his verbal attack on his victims as a . ‘seriously aggravating’ feature in the case. Hall had initially dismissed their claims as ‘cruel,  pernicious and spurious’ in a  statement made on the steps of a court. In . a lengthy ruling, Lord Judge said that Hall knew the truth and was . fully alert to the possible advantages of manipulating the media. At . that point, hoping to escape justice and trying to use the media to . possibly influence potential jurors, he  ‘traduced’ 13 women who had . been assaulted by him. Lord Judge said: ‘He did plead guilty but not before he had publicly and deliberately attacked the victims.’ Hall, from Wilmslow, Cheshire, who admitted 14 counts of indecent assault, showed no reaction to the doubling of his sentence. Celebrity: The court heard Hall abused his position as the star of It's A Knockout (pictured with two assistants who were not related to the case) Funnyman: Hall was also a much-loved sports commentator and presenter . Mugshot: Hall has been serving his time in HMP Preston where he shares a cell with another prisoner . He . had faced a maximum of five years in prison when first sentenced at . Preston Crown Court by the Recorder of  Preston, Judge Anthony  Russell . QC. But he was given a reduced term because of his guilty pleas. Lord . Judge said Hall ‘got away with it’ for decades and had ‘lived a lie for . more than half of his life’. At the end of yesterday’s hearing, he . concluded: ‘Making every allowance that can reasonably be made, this . sentence was inadequate. ‘We have to record that the successful . career hardly provides mitigation. On the contrary, it was the career . that put him in a position of trust that he was then able to exploit.’ It . contributed to his image as a cheerful, fun-loving, ‘fundamentally . decent man’. It also reinforced the view ‘that effectively he was . untouchable’. The judge said that, to his victims, Hall must have . seemed a ‘figure of power and authority and influence’. After the ruling . in London, Mr Grieve said: ‘I hope this case has highlighted that . historical sexual offences are always taken very seriously and shows . that the law still applies, whoever the offender may be.’ Hall’s . counsel, Crispin Aylett QC, said the original sentence was ‘entirely . appropriate’. If it was merciful, that was because Hall pleaded guilty . at an early stage, was 83 and his last offence was 27 years ago, he . added. The court’s ruling was welcomed by Alan Collins, from law firm . Pannone, which is  representing 17 women bringing compensation claims . against Hall and the BBC. He said: ‘It took into account Hall’s . attitude to those women. It’s good the Court of Appeal saw that [the . speech on the court steps] was an aggravating factor. It was terrible, . he shouldn’t have done it.’ The Mail revealed this month that Hall . has also tried to buy off his victims with as little as £2,000 to stop . them seeking further compensation. Married: Stuart Hall is pictured with his wife Hazel, with whom he had three children . Family man: The broadcaster poses for a photo with wife Hazel and children Francesca and Daniel . He preyed on 13 victims over 20 years, the youngest of whom was just nine. Stuart Hall used his fame and influence at the BBC to win the trust of parents and their children.He attacked some at his home and others while on the broadcaster’s premises. Fondled: Kim Wright is overjoyed at the stronger sentence . Hall’s youngest victim was assaulted under the sheets at her home while he read her a bedtime story.Another victim, aged just 13, was attacked in the bath when she attended a party at the home of one of Hall’s friends. Others were attacked in his car, his dressing room or while filming the gameshow It’s a Knockout. Last month two of the women who helped bring him to justice waived their right to anonymity to tell the Daily Mail of Hall’s abuse. Kim Wright, who had her breasts fondled by Hall in Blackpool when she was 17, said she was ‘overjoyed’ by the decision to double his jail term. Miss Wright, now 55, said: ‘I’m delighted. The original sentence was an absolute insult to his victims.I’m not a vindictive person, but justice has to be seen to be done. He was a paedophile and I wish people would call him that. ‘These little girls were unable to understand what was happening or protect themselves.’ Miss Wright was the first of Hall’s victims to make a formal complaint to police. She said: ‘When he picked on me, he picked on the wrong person. ‘I was convinced I can’t have been the only one and I felt it my duty to report it, in case there was someone out there who daren’t. Someone who’d suffered more than me. I know I did the right thing, but I didn’t do it for me, it was for the other women.’ Susan Harrison said she was 16 when the presenter lured her to BBC studios in 1967 on the false pretext of helping her record a song. Hall attacked her in his car while driving her home. She said ‘I was so shocked and terrified. I couldn’t do anything as I had frozen. It went on for a couple of minutes. ‘I was scared and I just wanted it all to go away.’ Miss Harrison suffered with depression for years as a result of the abuse. ‘Every time I saw him on TV, I would turn it off,’ she said. ‘I absolutely couldn’t stand to see him smiling and joking. ‘He was standing there presenting this persona but he had ruined my life.’ One of the women allegedly assaulted by Stuart Hall today said she wants to meet him in person to challenge him about his 'despicable' behaviour. The woman, known only as 'Jane', described Hall as 'a disgrace' and hit out at a BBC crew who she says looked the other way when she says she was attacked in the early 1980s aged 24. She told BBC 5 Live: 'Stuart Hall has not shown any remorse whatsoever and I feel that he should be made to be accountable and he should be to be accountable face to face with any of the victims who would be willing to put him through that process. 'His modus operandi was to isolate the women who he chose to abuse. He chose to make them as vulnerable as they possibly could be and what I would like to see is that he is vulnerable in the face of his victims and made to answer questions such as what made him think he could behave in such a way.' Jane was cornered by Hall, who was then in his 50s, outside a hotel while filming It's A Knockout abroad. When she rejected his advances he first apologised, saying it was a 'one-off', before chasing her into a hotel and 'forceably' trying to get . into her room, she said. 'I was mostly repulsed, I thought he was absolutely despicable and a . disgrace - I did feel he was using his position - somebody who was . famous - to be predatory,' Jane said. She is currently suing the BBC for what she says is a 'degree of culpability' in what happened. But because the alleged assault took place overseas and the law at the time did not allow cases from another jurisdiction to be brought to British courts, the Crown Prosecution Service was unable to take the case any further.","Veteran broadcaster Stuart Hall has his sentenced doubled to 30 months .

The most closely guarded, high-stakes secret in British retail — what on earth Marks & Spencer has come up with for its Christmas TV ad campaign — can today be revealed. But can it top last year’s offering, which starred a dancing Seb White, the little boy with Down’s Syndrome, without being naff or cheesy? Will it shift those all-important Christmas party dresses, cashmere sweaters and mince pies? Has it any chance of beating the annual offering from its nemesis, John Lewis? In the M&S Christmas advert, model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, in a check Collection sweater under a Collection coat, gives chase to her runaway dog . Oops! Falling down a rabbit hole, she loses her clothes. Luckily, Rosie is in her own label for Autograph silk and lace undies . And can it redeem the brand after the humourless ‘leading ladies’ autumn campaign, which saw the likes of artist Tracey Emin and pop starlet Ellie Goulding in the brand’s finest? Well, I have had a sneak preview of the advert, leaked to the Daily Mail from an insider on the set, and the answer to all of these questions appears to be: Yes. The ad will be unveiled to the Press in a gala screening tomorrow night (yes, Christmas ads are now that important), and will be screened on prime-time ITV on November 6. It has an all-British cast, including M&S golden girl Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and male model of the moment David Gandy, alongside Oscar-winning actress Helena Bonham Carter, in her first ever appearance for the brand. Welcome to the Mad Hatter's tea party, hosted by model David Gandy in Autograph menswear . Helena Bonham Carter's Wizard of Oz is in a black Per Una coat with faux fur collar . This time, I think M&S has done its homework, and pulled off quite a coup: while Bonham Carter is known for her rather eccentric style of bird’s-nest hair and socks worn with flip-flops, of late she has become something of a fashion icon. Post The King’s Speech, her wonderful portrayal on TV of Liz Taylor, and an appearance on the July cover of British Vogue, she has matured into not only a red carpet ambassador for British fashion, favouring Vivienne Westwood above all others, but a curvy, creamy, increasingly classic beauty. Bonham Carter is certainly a vast improvement on the iconic British women chosen for the autumn campaign — a motley crew of athletes, artists, actors and authors in a shoot by legendary U.S. photographer Annie Leibovitz that was too glossy and too unattainable, with no fun or mischief at all. Here, Helena makes a hilarious appearance in a fairytale that, although only two minutes long, cost many millions to produce. At the end of the ad, back in the real world, Helena reunites Rosie with her dog . The story — directed by Swedish music video maestro Johan Renck, who has made shorts for Madonna, Kylie Minogue and Robbie Williams — has a cinematic soundtrack. The narrative is as follows: Rosie, gorgeous pillow-lipped creature that she is, clad in checked sweater, cream coat and black skinny jeans, emerges from her house in a very Victorian, deserted London with her West Highland terrier (Oh my God, he’s gorgeous! So much so that the store will be selling stuffed toys which look like the actor dog, Ralph). The dog then runs away, and disappears down a rabbit hole. Rosie sets off in hot pursuit (who knew she could squeeze down a tiny hole with those extravagant breasts?). And, losing her clothes on the way to reveal her underwear (boys: there are two shots of Rosie wearing very little indeed — she has never looked more beautiful), she enters a magical world of Alice In Wonderland, where the tea party is hosted by male model Gandy, clad in immaculate British-manufactured menswear. Rosie magically transforms into Red Riding Hood (sporting a gorgeous Autograph red coat), then is transported on a magic carpet straight out of the Arabian Knights, and becomes Dorothy, all pigtails and cream cocktail dress, to enter the land of The Wizard Of Oz. Off duty: Helena Bonham Carter, pictured left with her CBE medal, and out and about in north London is known for a more eccentric style . Which is where a giant Bonham Carter . comes in, as the wizard, which suits her down to the ground. ‘Love those . red shoes!’ she booms, in that famous, cut-glass voice. Finally, Rosie (who knew she could act!) re-emerges into the real world to find that Helena, immaculate in a faux fur-trimmed black coat, has not only rescued her dog (Phew! Remember, an abused dog, shivering outside in a snow-covered kennel, didn’t work terribly well for John Lewis), but admires Rosie’s outfit as well. The product placement — dresses, dresses and more dresses — is perfect, and there is nothing cheesy about the production, apart from the Cheddar truckles at the tea party. It’s fun, and, given the chemistry between Rosie and Gandy, super sexy. Rosie is a reliable cash cow (excuse the term) for Marks, with her own-label lingerie selling more than any other brand in the store’s history. And the chiselled features of David Gandy will keep mums, who will be the ones lugging those Magic and Sparkle carrier bags home, very happy indeed. Wonderful: After her portrayal on TV of Liz Taylor, and an appearance on the July cover of British Vogue, Helena has matured into a red carpet ambassador for British fashion . Regal: Helena Bonham Carter, who won an Oscar for her performance in The King's Speech, is a classy, unexpected ingredient in the advert, writes Liz Jones . And Helena Bonham Carter? Teamed cleverly with Rosie, she’s a classy, unexpected ingredient in a perfect mix that will appeal to Everywoman, being neither too frumpy, nor too unattainable. She’s a busy, likeable North London mum in her late 40s who hasn’t decamped to Beverly Hills or opted for cosmetic surgery, and proves that, with M&S’s help, she scrubs up extremely well, giving us ordinary mortals big buckets of hope. The bigwigs at Marks’ HQ in Paddington — CEO Marc Bolland, head of fashion Belinda Earl et al — are trembling in their shoes, anxious not only about how the ad will play to the Press on Tuesday night, but also what on earth John Lewis has up its merino wool sleeve. From my sneak preview, the ad is a triumph. But will other viewers agree? For M&S’s vocal shareholders, this cannot just be a vanity project, an escape for a few moments into fantasy. It has to make those cash registers burst into song.","Cast includes Helena Bonham Carter and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley .

A dog lost on a 2,300ft hill for three weeks after chasing a rabbit and breaking its leg was saved by eight rescuers who carried him a mile to safety on a stretcher. The lurcher-Saluki cross was found half-starved near a World War Two memorial at the top of Buckden Pike fell in the Yorkshire Dales. It is thought the four-year-old dog had chased a rabbit up the hill, got lost and then been stuck on the fell for nearly a month with his injured limb. Pet rescue: The dog lost on a fell top in the Yorkshire Dales with a broken leg was saved by a team of wight mountain rescuers who carried the lurcher-Saluku cross, nicknamed Wulfra, to safety on their stretcher . Found: A walker spotted the dog lying injured on a 2,300ft-tall fell, close to a memorial cross that commemorates the crash of a Wellington bomber during the Second World War . Saved: Volunteers from the Upper Wharfedale Fell Rescue Association were called out to go to the animal's aid . The animal, nicknamed Wufra, was finally saved by members of the Upper Wharfedale Fell Rescue Association (UWFRA) who were called out to go to the animal’s aid. Team Leader Andy Jackson, 44, said eight members went up and carefully carried Wufra a mile down hill to safety. 'He was so camouflaged he was probably hard to see,' said Mr Jackson. 'Fortunately, he was on the side that was protected from the worst of the weather. On a mission: The volunteers put Wufra into a casualty bag and onto the stretcher to carry him the mile down the side of the fell . Relief: Rescue worker Andy Jackson said that Wufra had been happy to see the team, and seemed to enjoy his trip on the stretcher . 'When we eventually moved him, we put him into a casualty bag and on to the stretcher, the actual grass had started to die where he had been sitting. 'He was happy to see us. He just had nothing in him. There was a lot of bone. 'He was obviously a thin dog anyway, but it looked like he hadn’t eaten. 'I don’t think he would have been able to stand up. He was quite happy to be picked up, kept warm and seemed to quite enjoy his trip down in the stretcher. Safe at last: The team then carried Wufra to their vehicles parked on a track near the village of Starbotton in Wharfedale, North Yorkshire .

The French government is calling for a schoolgirl to be prosecuted after she waved a banana at France's black Justice Minister. The child was heard shouting insults at Christiane Taubira during a demonstration in Angers, western France against the government's decision to support same-sex marriages. The 12-year-old was then seen waving a banana at the minister and shouting: 'Who's the banana for? It's for the monkey', according to witness Jean-Yves Lignel, a reporter with LeCourrier de l'Ouest. Leaders of the ruling Socialist Party now want to press charges against the girl of incitement to racial hatred. Journalist Mr Lignel wrote on his blog: 'Nine of the adults around her did anything to stop her. Some even sniggered.' According to The Times, Harlem Desir, the First Secretary of the Socialist Party, said in a statement: 'It is very serious that children are being used and encouraged to shout chants of hated during protests against same sex-marriages. 'This behaviour is intolerable and constitutes a criminal offence which must now be the subject of a prosecution.' Mr Desir believes the child's parents should be prosecuted. Lawyers have said that because of her age, the child cannot be jailed, fined or given a restraining order. The 12-year-old was then seen waving a banana at the minister and shouting: 'Who's the banana for? Ms Taubia said she didn't want to turn the situation into a soap drama but that it was worrying for society. An investigation has begun after a National Front candidate compared Ms Taubira to a monkey last week.

A University of Michigan fraternity has sparked outrage after its brothers planned a 'racially and sexually offensive' party dubbed 'World Star Hip Hop Presents: Hood Ratchet Thursday.' The event, planned by Theta Xi, was advertised in a Facebook invite with a picture of a black man holding a wad of cash and said things like 'we goin back to da hood again!!' and 'hood IDs will be checked.' After fielding numerous complaints from offended students, the university has cancelled the November 7 bash, which requested 'bad bitches, white girls, basketball players, thugs and gangsters' to attend. Outrage: The event, planned by Theta Xi fraternity, pictured, was advertised in a Facebook invite with a picture of a black man holding a wad of cash and said things like 'we goin back to da hood again!!' and 'hood IDs will be checked' The students said the invitation parodied black culture and offended women, referring to twerking contests, calling females 'bad bitches' and repeatedly using the word 'ratchet.' U-M officials sent out an email Thursday morning reprimanding the fraternity for the planned event and stating that the school plans to sanction the fraternity and offer educational forums, according to Mlive.com. 'The language of the invitation and theme of the party denigrated all women and African American/black identified people through racial stereotypes and cultural appropriation,' the school's Vice President for Student Affairs E. Royster Harper said in an email. 'This behavior is offensive, disrespectful and unacceptable at the University of Michigan. It is unhealthy and harms everyone in the community. It is in direct contradiction to the values, policies and expectations of the University and will not be tolerated.' As well as cancelling the party, the national fraternity headquarters has imposed social restrictions on Theta Xi pending a full investigation. The university said the fraternity would be offering an apology but as yet it hasn't commented. 'Disturbingly, negative stereotypes and misogynistic behavior are woven into popular culture today. We believe this reinforces the ongoing need to continually pay attention to diversity and engage in thoughtful, challenging conversations about social identities,' Harper added in the email. 'It is our expectation that significant learning for the campus community will emerge from these offensive actions. We are in the process of planning educational forums.' Secretary for the Black Student Union LSA junior Geralyn Gaines told MichiganDaily.com she felt 'complete and utter disgust' when she saw the invite. Gaines said she was particularly offended by the use of the term 'ratchet,' which she says is used to describe something terrible or someone who can't handle themselves. She added it was the first time she's personally experienced racism on campus or felt specifically targeted.","The event, planned by Theta Xi fraternity, was advertised in a Facebook invite with a picture of a black man holding a wad of cash .

'[Don't talk] about annoying hipster topics, or who you f***** last night. You shouldn't do that anyhow, but our neighbors actually can hear you.'

Forthright opinion: Lord Lawson told MPs pay consultants who advise banks on their salary packages make prostitutes look 'respectable' Pay consultants who advise banks on their salary packages make prostitutes look ‘respectable’, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer said today. Tory peer Lord Lawson gave his forthright opinion as MPs took evidence on standards in the banking industry. He said: ‘In my experience, they [pay consultants] are a profession which makes prostitution seem thoroughly respectable.’ And Lord Lawson, who ran Britain’s finances under Margaret Thatcher, refused to back down even when a female witness giving evidence to him took exception to the characterisation. Carol Arrowsmith, a senior pay consultant with accountancy firm Deloitte, said it was ‘difficult’ to accept the suggestion that her profession was worse than prostitution. ‘It may be difficult but it may be true,’ retorted the famously outspoken Westminster grandee. Lord Lawson, who as Nigel Lawson served as Chancellor under Margaret Thatcher, said pay consultants feared missing out on future advisory fees if they angered bank bosses by suggesting modest pay deals. ‘They know that if they recommend low pay, they won’t get a repeat performance...so they pitch it as high as they can,’ he said. Another witness, management author David Bolchover, said there was an ‘extremely powerful nexus’ in the business community with a ‘vested interest in high pay’. He accused bankers of profiting from a myth that very few people could do their job, despite the fact that it is ‘extremely questionable whether they have a rare talent’. And he said bosses were too scared to cut the pay of junior staff, in case their own salaries were slashed as well. ‘These decisions are hard-wired into the system,’ he said. Hearing: Lord Lawson, pictured with daughter Nigella Lawson, made the comments as MPs took evidence on standards in the banking industry . The banking standards committee also . heard from former Barclays pay chief Alison Carnwath, who said she had . been a lone voice in calling for former boss Bob Diamond to be stripped . of his bonus in 2011. Mr Diamond was awarded a £2.7million bonus in 2011, the same year that the bank had to put aside £1billion to cover the cost of compensation for mis-selling PPI loan insurance. Former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond received a £2.7m bonus in 2011 . Ms Carnwath said she had been ‘amazed’ when Barclays chairman Marcus Agius recommended that the bonus be paid anyway. ‘I thought it was the wrong recommendation and...it would have been best if his bonus for the year had been zero,’ she said, adding that this would have set a ‘leadership example’. But she said fellow directors were worried at how Mr Diamond would react to losing the payout. ‘There were conversations in corridors,’ she said. ‘A lot of people felt Mr Diamond needed to have his bonus and that it was important to him.’ She added that investment bankers had become used to an ‘obscene level of reward’ and indulged in a ‘culture of entitlement’. Mr Diamond later stepped down after the bank was fined £290million for its role in the Libor interest rate-rigging scandal. Her successor Sir John Sunderland raised eyebrows among MPs when he said that even with hindsight he would still pay Mr Diamond a bonus, because he ‘deserved some recognition’. But he insisted reports that Barclays’ new boss Antony Jenkins was in line for a £1million bonus this year were just ‘speculation’. Asked if he was aware that a payout on that scale could spark fury among the public, he said: ‘I understand the implications of your question very well.’","Lord Lawson made comment as MPs took evidence on standards in banking .

Andrew Rosenfeld founded a company that gives free mobile calls and text messages to Unite members . A firm set up by one of Labour’s biggest donors has been helping union thugs who are running a campaign of intimidation. The People’s Operator, a mobile phone company founded by multi-millionaire Andrew Rosenfeld – a close friend of Ed Miliband – gives free mobile calls and text messages to Unite members. It signed a deal last year to supply phones to activists and funnel cash to the union. A document drawn up by Unite reveals that strike committees get free calls and text messages to coordinate mob action. The Mail revealed yesterday how Unite was carrying out a campaign of bullying and intimidation against senior managers during the bitter dispute over Grangemouth oil refinery. The union’s so-called ‘leverage’ teams sent dozens of thugs to invade the driveway of a boss at the refinery in Scotland during a dispute this month – leaving his wife and children fearing for their safety. David Cameron said the Mail’s revelations were ‘shocking’ and called on Mr Miliband to reopen a Labour investigation of Unite activities. The Prime Minister said: ‘People have a right to protest. But no one has a right to intimidate, nobody has a right to bully. Unite leaders deployed a dirty tricks squad to target and humiliate executives of the Ineos chemical company and their families . ‘Nobody has a right to threaten people’s families, no one has a right to threaten people in their homes. It is very serious. ‘The Labour Party does need to investigate what has been happening with the Unite union. Action needs to be taken.’ Andrew Rosenfeld, 51, is one of Labour’s biggest individual donors, having recently returned from tax exile in Switzerland. He made around £100million from his property company Minerva, before he sold up and moved for ‘lifestyle reasons’ in 2006. Mr Rosenfeld also sold his £5.5million London house to a trust in Liechtenstein. He then bought a £9million mansion in the Vandoeuvres area of Geneva. While Ed Miliband claims to speak for cash-strapped voters, Mr Rosenfeld has been conspicuous by his consumption. He once bought an £8.5million house in cash. It was also reported he made £30million selling his Geneva mansion to the daughter of Uzbekistan dictator Islam Karimov, a man accused of boiling his enemies to death. When he returned to Britain in 2011 Mr Rosenfeld was brought into Mr Miliband’s inner circle at the top of the Labour Party.Shortly after a series of large donations he was given a formal role involving external relations, fundraising, supporter and trade union engagement. Mr Rosenfeld has given or pledged Labour around £2million in donations and loans since 2005. He first loaned £1million to the party to fund their 2005 election campaign, money that was reportedly repaid in 2009. But that loan led to him becoming linked to the Cash for Honours scandal when it emerged his name was on a list of businessmen earmarked for a peerage. Since Mr Miliband became leader, Mr Rosenfeld has donated £663,494.30 to Labour. He has also promised to donate a total of £1million before the next election. Despite his close friendship with Ed Miliband, Mr Rosenfeld hasn’t always backed Labour. In 2001 he donated £10,000 to Ken Clarke’s bid to become Tory leader. And he once lavished praise on David Cameron’s campaign to become Prime Minister, saying he was the ‘man for the job’.Mr Rosenfeld said: ‘We are tired of the whole Labour message. Only Mr Cameron has the real capability of governing.’ In April this year the Mail reported the property developer had separated from his wife Nicola and was living with Juliet Soskice, a former girlfriend of Mr Miliband. He set up home with the brunette psychotherapist on the fringes of Regent’s Park. The revelation that one of Labour’s . biggest solo donors has been helping Unite came in a 50-page guide . published by the union for its activists. It details how they should . identify ‘the potential vulnerabilities of the employer’ so they can hit . them with leverage action. The document states: ‘Leverage treats the employer as an opponent’ and advises ‘escalation is critical’. It also reveals how Unite has used its . relationship with The People’s Operator to facilitate industrial action, . stating: ‘TPO (The People’s Operator) is a Unite-backed mobile phone . operator providing cheap phone services to members and free TPO to TPO . calls and text messaging. 'TPO sim cards should be provided to all . contacts to enable free text messaging and calls between strike . committee members and activists.’ Unite officials say the sim cards are paid for by strike committees themselves – but when they go on strike they can get funds to pay for them from the union. The People’s Operator was set up last year and boasts that it helps its partners send money to ‘charities’ and other good causes. Under the deal with Unite, the union is paid 10 per cent of the call, text or data spend of any members they sign up to the service. Mr Rosenfeld, a former tax exile, has given Labour more than £663,000 since Mr Miliband became leader. He has promised to give another £1million more in the run up to the next general election. The Mail revealed yesterday how Unite leaders deployed a dirty tricks squad to target and humiliate executives of the Ineos chemical company and their families. The leverage team sent mobs of protesters to the homes of senior figures in the firm, which owns the Grangemouth refinery. The daughter of one company boss had ‘Wanted’ posters denouncing her father posted through her front door hundreds of miles away. In a letter to Mr Miliband yesterday, Tory Chairman Grant Shapps called on the Labour leader to condemn Unite’s activities, asking: ‘Will you now refuse to accept any more money from Unite until those responsible for threatening innocent families are disciplined?’ Mr Miliband’s aides at first condemned the Tories for being ‘irresponsible by inflaming a difficult situation’. But on viewing TV news coverage of the Mail story, Mr Miliband said: ‘I condemn intimidatory tactics. It is not how industrial disputes should be conducted. This is true for unions just as it is true for employers.’ Unite general secretary Len McCluskey refused to back down last night, making clear he would continue to advocate bully-boy tactics. He told Channel 4 News: ‘It’s a small part of our leverage. We reserve the right to do anything within the law.’ A Unite spokesman said: ‘We work with TPO to provide our members the best mobile service at the lowest cost. ‘Trying to find something sinister in this is simply desperate.’ The Mail contacted the head office of The People’s Operator and asked for a response from Andrew Rosenfeld or the company but was told no one was available for comment.","The People's Operator, a mobile phone company founded by millionaire Andrew Rosenfeld gives free calls and text messages to Unite members .

The already remarkable life of Holocaust survivor George Horner is about to take another exceptional turn. The 90-year-old pianist will make his orchestral debut with renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma tonight at Boston's Symphony Hall. They'll be playing music composed 70 years ago at the Nazi prison camp where Horner was imprisoned. Remarkable: Dr George Horner will perform songs composed in the Nazis concentration camps . 'It's an extraordinary link to the past,' said concert organizer Mark Ludwig. The performance will benefit the Terezin Music Foundation, an organisation dedicated to preserving the work of artists and musicians killed in the Holocaust. Led by Ludwig, the foundation is named for the town of Terezin, site of an unusual Jewish ghetto in what was then German-occupied Czechoslovakia. There, even amid death and hard labor, Nazi soldiers allowed prisoners to stage artistic performances. Horner played piano and accordion in the Terezin cabarets, including tunes written by fellow inmate Karel Svenk. On Tuesday, Horner will play two of Svenk's works solo — a march and a lullaby — and then team up with Ma for a third piece called 'How Come the Black Man Sits in the Back of the Bus?' Memories: Dr George Horner performs a song on the piano at his home in Newtown Square, Philadelphia . Legacy: Horner agreed to do the performance which he described as a 'noble' mission . Svenk did not survive the genocide. But his musical legacy has, due in part to a chance meeting of Ludwig, a scholar of Terezin composers, and Horner, who never forgot the songs that were written and played in captivity. George Horner will join Yo-Yo Ma tonight at Boston's Symphony Hall . Ludwig said he found it hard to ask Horner to perform pieces laden with such difficult memories. 'To ask somebody who played this in the camps, that's asking a lot,' said Ludwig. Yet Horner, now a retired doctor living near Philadelphia, readily agreed to what he described as a 'noble' mission. It didn't hurt that he would be sharing the stage with Ma — even if he thought Ludwig was joking at first. 'I couldn't believe it, because it's a fantastic thing for me.' The program features additional performances by Ma and the Hawthorne String Quartet.

New York Sen. Chuck Schumer said Sunday that he plans to introduce legislation that will ban these weapons, which would be  undetectable from metal detectors. 'We’re facing a situation where anyone -- a felon, a terrorist -- can open a gun factory in their garage and the weapons they make will be undetectable. It’s stomach-churning,' he said.

Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, is a way of creating a 3D solid object from a digital model. It is achieved by laying down layer upon layer of a chosen material. The layers are then joined together to create the final shape. It takes blueprints from computer aided design and 'slices' them into digital cross-sections that the machine uses as a guideline for printing. The technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace. It can be used to create almost any shape. 'Guns are made out of plastic, so they would not be detectable by a metal detector at any airport or sporting event,' Schumer said, according WCBS 880. 'Only metal part of the gun is the little firing pin and that is too small to be detected by metal detectors, for instance, when you go through an airport. 'A terrorist, someone who’s mentally ill, a spousal abuser, a felon can essentially open a gun factory in their garage.' Schumer wants to renew a previous ban on undetectable weapons while the new bill would add a ban on plastic high-capacity magazines. 'People have made silencers, stocks, triggers and lots of other gun parts. They can then upload these digital blueprints to the web and then anyone with one of these printers – and the printers cost about $1,000 – can make one,' Schumer said. 'It's stomach churning': New York Senator Chuck Schumer plans to introduce legislation that would ban plastic guns made from 3-D printers . Easy to make: Schumer says a plastic, 3-D gun can be made for as little as $1,000 and can be accessed by any terrorist, convict or mentally ill person . The plastic handgun is made when the user inputs a digital blueprint of the weapon and it is then printed with molded plastic. The technology is not new, it has been around for more than a decade, but only recently have people thought to use for weapons manufacturing, Schumer said. While there is current law banning all-plastic weaponry, the weapons have just one metal piece, which is too small to be reliably detected by metal detectors and can easily be swapped out for a plastic piece. Defense Distributed, the firm behind the gun, has put plans for it online so anyone can download them. Founder Cody Wilson has worked for over a year on the project, and the gun is made from 15 parts, which the only non-plastic part a common nail, which acts as the firing pin. Wilson says the design is based on the one-shot pistols that were designed to be air-dropped over France during World War II as inspiration - and also called the Liberator. The future of weapons?

Under attack: Pilot Officer Paul Baillon was forced to bail out of his Spitfire Mark 1 after a tense clash with the Luftwaffe in the skies above Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, during World War II . Rosemary Baillon never knew her father. A war hero who flew Spitfires in the Battle of Britain, he was tragically killed aged 26 in a dogfight over the English Channel in November 1940 - four months before she was born. It wasn't Pilot Officer Paul Baillon's first brush with the Luftwaffe. A month earlier he had been at the controls of one of the iconic fighters when it was shot from the skies of south-west England by a German bomber's machineguns. On that occasion, the RAF ace bailed out safely but his stricken aircraft crashed on Salisbury Plain. In an upbeat letter to his wife and . Miss Baillon's mother, Peggy, he recalled the episode as 'all very . exciting... especially coming down by parachute which really was not at . all unpleasant!' His words from beyond the grave were among the little Miss Baillon knew of the incident... until yesterday. For . the 72-year-old, a research fellow in geopolitics, was present when . wreckage from the Spitfire Mark 1 from which her father ejected unharmed . was dug up by soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan. The . physically and mentally-injured troops and veterans excavated the . remnants of the plane, buried for 73 years, as part of Operation . Nightingale, an award-winning Ministry of Defence project which uses . archaeology to aid their recovery. During . a highly emotional day, Miss Baillon was handed buried artefacts from . the stricken, mangled plane, number P9503, including part of a . propeller, a crumpled fuel gauge, a piece of windscreen and buckles from . the parachute release mechanism. The trinkets were small but meant the world to the pilot's daughter. She said: 'Seeing the Spitfire being excavated meant a great deal to me. It is remarkable to touch something that my father would have touched so many years ago. Brave: Pilot Baillon's Spitfire Mark 1 (stock image pictured) crashed on the Salisbury Plain on October 27, 1940. The officer incredibly survived after bailing out of the aircraft but was killed a month later in a clash with the Luftwaffe over the channel . Momentous occasion: Pilot Baillon's daughter Rosemary, 72, pictured, yesterday witnessed her father's plane being excavated on the Salisbury Plain nearly 73 years after it crash landed . Award-winning programme: The remains of the Spitfire Mark 1, number P9503, are being excavated by soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan as part of the Ministry of Defence project Operation Nightingale . 'It makes me feel closer to my father. Coming here and seeing the landscape has made what happened to him more realistic. 'Like anyone who lost their father in the war, you are always emotional all your life, you always have a sense of mourning for never knowing them. Nothing will ever take that away but being here has been a great comfort.' Pilot Officer Baillon, from Northamptonshire, was a solicitor before the Second World War but at the first prospect of conflict he joined the RAF volunteer reserve and learned to fly. He was posted to fly Spitfires with 609 Squadron - the first unit to record 100 'kills' - and was stationed at Middle Wallop. On October 27, 1940, he and two comrades took off in pursuit of a German bomber - a Junkers 88 or Heinkel 111, according to combat logs - which was heading to bombard the docks and armaments factories in the west of England. The remains of Pilot Baillon's Spitfire plane that has been uncovered. Soldiers have already pulled part of the landing gear and some bullets from the ground . Good cause: The Ministry of Defence archaeology project is to help aid wounded soldiers' rehabilitation . Guess work: Wounded soldiers read a manual on the Spitfire to try and identify parts of the plane they uncovered during the dig . Crash site: The Spitfire Mark 1 crashed on the Salisbury Plain more than 70 years ago on October 27, 1940, after coming under attack by a German plane . As they attacked, a round from the . German plane punctured his oil tank, spewing fuel all over the . windscreen and 'reducing visibility to nil'. Unsure he could land the . Spitfire safely, Pilot Officer Baillon bailed out and the aircraft . crashed close to Upavon, Wiltshire. In his letter home from his base, the astonishingly matter-of-fact RAF officer said: 'I came down quite unharmed close to an aerodrome where I washed off all the oil which simply covered my face and head, had some lunch, chatted with some fellows I knew there and was flown back here this afternoon.' A month later, during a dogfight with the Luftwaffe over the Channel, the pilot was shot down and killed. He is buried at Bayeux in France. More than 70 years later, Richard Osgood, a senior historic advisor at the Defence Infrastructure Organisation, which runs the MoD's land and properties, received a request from amateur archaeologists to excavate the site. Lethal: Bullets were among the Spitfire plane parts to be found during the dig yesterday . Discoveries: The soldiers uncovered part of a propeller, a crumpled fuel gauge, a piece of windscreen and buckles from the parachute release mechanism as well as several bullets . Delicate operation: Rosemary Baillon, seen second left, watches as a soldier unearths parts of her father's Spitfire Mark 1 . Mr Osgood, who founded Operation . Nightingale for injured Riflemen, refused because the wreckage was . buried on MoD land. But he thought it would be an excellent site for the . wounded troops to investigate. He . assembled a team of around 25 current and ex-members of The Rifles to . take part in the dig, which began this week. In a remarkable twist, they . managed to trace Pilot Officer Baillon's daughter, who lives near . Stowmarket, Suffolk, to inform her of the project. Mr Osgood said: 'The project has made a poignant and moving discovery. Archaeology is all about people – whether they be prehistoric, Roman, Saxon or those who flew in the Second World War. ‘This site has yielded traces relating to the sacrifices of airmen from the 1940s and it has been a real privilege to re-tell the story of Paul Baillon. 'We knew from the combat logs kept at the time what happened during this flight but we don't know the final few moments before the plane crashed. 'This excavation is the final piece in that story.' Special moment: Rosemary Baillon said getting to see parts of the plane piloted by her father, who died before she was born, has been a great comfort . Rare opportunity: Around 25 former members of The Rifles took part in the dig on Ministry of Defence land . Going all out: Those running Operation Nightingale managed to track down Rosemary Baillon to inform her of the project and invite her to visit the excavation site . In action: A Spitfire Mark 1 similar to that flown by Pilot Officer Paul Baillion pictured in the sky . The team will now analyse the remnants dug up to try and find out more about exactly how the Spitfire crashed. Lance Corporal Dave Hart, 37, who suffered serious arm injuries in a suicide attack in Afghanistan in 2004, signed up to Operation Nightingale after leaving the 6th Battalion The Rifles on medical grounds. The primary school teacher from Tiverton, Devon, has now completed eight digs. He said: 'It was fascinating to excavate Iron Age and Bronze Age sites but to dig a Spitfire is magical. Everyone knows about their importance in the war. To be able to do it for Rosemary is extra special.' Operation Nightingale was inspired by the novel 'A Month In The Country', which portrays an injured First World War veteran who convalesces by restoring a Medieval church mural. The programme helps with troops' recovery by boosting their confidence and self-esteem, ensuring they do not fall victim to depression and family breakdown, and giving them new skills for when they return to duty or start a new life outside the military. Under the guidance of experienced archaeologists, wounded soldiers from The Rifles have been taking painstaking care to excavate historic sites. Happy couple: Pilot Officer Paul Baillon and his wife Peggy in 1939, just one year before he died . Family ties: Rosemary Baillon never got to meet her father but said getting to see his plane being excavated has given her a new link to him . Lucky escape: Pilot Officer Paul Baillon didn't die in the Salisbury plane crash after he managed to bail out in his parachute in time. Tragically he was killed a month later . They have learned to photograph and map landscapes using state-of-the-art surveying equipment, careful uncover, clean and bag artefacts, and catalogue their invaluable finds. Last year the injured troops uncovered 26 Saxon burials, an earlier prehistoric cremation, three shields, five spears and drinking vessel and other artefacts dating back to the 6th Century during a dig at Barrow Clump on Salisbury Plain. They have also discovered bone combs, prehistoric pottery, beads and stone tools at a remarkable Bronze Age midden, or artificial hill, at East Chisenbury, Wiltshire. Because the sites lie within the restricted Army training area on Salisbury Plain they have been protected from destruction by farms, settlements and roads as well as the attention of other archaeologists. The ground-breaking project is supported by Cranfield University, Wessex Archaeology, English Heritage, 135 Geographical Squadron Royal Engineers and 609 Squadron Royal Auxillary Air Force. Operation Nightingale has won a British Archaeological Award to recognise its work and has appeared on the Channel 4 programme Time Team.

But the slim, 16.5ft-wide, five-storey house, located on Lexington Ave in New York's Upper East Side, is not quite the impoverished artists's studio. It's on the market at a cool at $5.8million. The living room: Andy Warhol bought this townhouse on Lexington Avenue in in 1959 for $60,000 and lived there for 15 years, sharing the Carnegie Hill-area home with his mother, Júlia. It is now on sale for nearly $5.8million . However, for the Warhol admirer, the place may be the ultimate collector's item. The artist bought the home in 1959 for $60,000 and lived there for 15 years, sharing the Carnegie Hill-area home with his mother, Júlia. It was during that time period that Warhol created some of his most iconic work, including colourful renditions of Campbell's soup cans, dollar bills and comic strips. He used the house itself as his studio in the early Sixties, reportedly leaning canvases against a fireplace in one wood-panelled room. Later he took his work to various other locations around the city, known as his 'factories', where assistants would controversially help him to create many of the masterpieces which bear his name. Inspirational: It was while living in this New York home that Warhol created some of his most iconic work, including colourful renditions of Campbell's soup cans, dollar bills and comic strips . The living room: He used the house itself as his studio in the early-Sixties, reportedly leaning canvases against a fireplace in one wood-panelled room, but later moved his work on to a series of 'factories' around the city . All mod cons: After Warhol's death, Edward J. Hughes, his business manager, bought the home for $593,000. Since then the house has passed through two owners and undergone small-scale renovations . Comfortable: Warhol's nephew, James Warhola recalled how, after arriving at his eccentric uncle's home late at night, he woke up in an upstairs bedroom stacked high with towers of Campbell's tins and Brillo cartons . The 3,072 sq/ft Manhattan townhouse, which opens straight onto busy Lexington Avenue, was originally built in 1889 to a design by Henry J. Hardenbergh, the same architect behind the plaza hotel and the Dakota. At just 48ft deep and 16.5ft wide, it is smaller than many Upper East Side townhouses, most of which are about 100ft deep, according to city tax records cited by the Times. It has four bedrooms, one en-suite, each with wood-burning fireplaces, four separate bathrooms, and a wood-panelled dining room. Iconic: Warhol's famous Campbell's soup tins screenprint. The unifying element in Warhol's work is his deadpan Keatonesque style - artistically and personally affectless - which he also assumed in life . The ultimate collector's item: Left, Andy Warhol. Right, the exterior of the home seen from Lexington Avenue. At just 48ft deep and 16.5ft wide, it is smaller than many Upper East Side townhouses, but has unique appeal . Warhol's nephew, James Warhola, wrote and illustrated a 2003 children's book called Uncle Andy's about a family visit to the Lexington Avenue home in the early-Sixties. He told the New York Times when the house was last on the market in 2008 how, after arriving at his eccentric uncle's home late at night, he woke up in an upstairs bedroom stacked high with towers of Campbell's tins and Brillo cartons. 'I always thought the house should have been a museum,' he told the Times. 'All those important early Pop paintings are in museums scattered across the world.' Warhol leased the home to Frederick W. Hughes, his business manager, in 1974. Fifteen years later, after the artist's death, Mr Hughes bought the home for $593,000 from the Warhol estate. Since then the house has passed through two owners and undergone small-scale renovations.

If you ever wanted a definition of what ‘aghast’ looks like, here’s a handy lesson courtesy of Prince Charles. The prince pulled the rather vivid facial expression as he mingled with guests at a Clarence House reception to honour members of the nursing profession. Yet by rights, they should have been the ones looking shocked. Because he had just told a group of respiratory nurses about his childhood vice – smoking behind a chicken coop when he was at school. Quip: Charles talked about his youthful indiscretion while meeting award-winning respiratory nurses . Confession: Prince Charles, pictured left today and right aged 11, has admitted smoking as a schoolboy . Nurse and secondary school teacher Paul Watson, 39, from Peterborough said afterwards: ‘There was a few of us that are respiratory nurses and he asked whether we deal with a lot of smokers. ‘He said, ""I gave up at 11 when I had a few cigarettes behind a chicken coop."" ‘I believe it was tongue in cheek.’ It’s not the first time the prince had admitted to trying a crafty ciggie. In November 1998 he made the same confession to schoolchildren on an official visit to Slovenia. Prince Charles asked pupils at the Martin Krpan School in Ljubljana whether they had ever tried smoking - and about half of the 28 pupils taking part in the seminar with him said they had. Event: Charles talks to cancer nurse Victoria Harmer at the Nursing Times Awards held at Clarence House . ‘I gave up smoking at the age of 11,’ said Prince Charles. ‘I had one or two strong ones behind the chicken run at school. The good thing is to give them up when you are young.’ The Slovenian pupils, told what the prince had said by a translator, burst into laughter. Blaz Bhaklar, 11, said he had read that U.S. President Bill Clinton had tried smoking marijuana. The prince replied: ‘Don't believe everything you read in the newspapers.’ Charles would have been at Cheam preparatory school in Berkshire at the time he was talking about. He hinted that in trying cigarettes he had bowed to peer pressure from his classmates. A spokesman at Clarence House declined to comment further today. But in previous years they have suggested that the prince’s wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, who was once rather a heavy smoker, has given up. Tribute: The Prince wrote an article in Nursing Times praising the contribution nurses make to public health . In a Q&A session on its website . it says, 'Q. Are the reports that The Duchess is still a smoker true? A: . No. The Duchess of Cornwall gave up smoking many years ago.' However Charles's son, Prince Harry, has long been an unapologetic smoker. The prince’s remarks were made at a reception he hosted to pay tribute to the nominees of the Nursing Times annual awards. Charles . hailed the dedication and hard work of the nation's nurses, saying they . give 'exceptional care' to patients across the country. Writing . in the Nursing Times ahead of the magazine's awards ceremony, he said . he believed nurses' care and kindness was 'vital' and stressed the . importance of a holistic approach to those who are sick. Charles, . who is patron of more than 30 healthcare organisations, said his visits . to hospitals over the past 40 years had shown him just how pivotal a . role nurses play. Recognition: The Prince talking to Patricia McDermott, nominated for outstanding continence care . He wrote: 'In all these instances, . together with many others, it was abundantly clear to me just how . important the emotional connection between patients and skilled, . hard-working nurses actually was. 'In . general, quite apart from the medical expertise that nursing staff . provide on a daily and nightly basis, the reassurance and simple human . kindness that they can also dispense is, I believe, vital and must . surely impact positively on the recovery of individuals. 'Human kindness, reassurance and sympathy are age-old qualities, yet they are as important today as they have ever been. 'The . Nursing Times Awards recognise this, as well as the importance of a . holistic approach - treating the whole person, rather than just the . symptoms of disease. 'When . this approach is combined with the best of conventional medicine, and . adopted by the whole healthcare team, with scrupulous attention to every . aspect of the patient's personal, medical and nursing needs, great . progress can be made.' Youngster: Charles is pictured in 1959 driving away from Cheam school with his grandmother, mother and sister . Health campaigners said today that while they could not comment on the prince’s remarks directly, the issue of children taking up smoking was one of deep concern. Indeed, laws to allow the Secretary of State powers to introduce standard packaging for tobacco products sold in places to which children have access are expected to be debated in the House of Lords next month. Dr Penny Woods, Chief Executive of the British Lung Foundation, told the Mail that 80 per cent of smokers admitted starting in their teens. ‘It may be a number of years since Prince Charles tried smoking as a child, but sadly children smoking is not just a concern of the past. Indeed, more than 200,000 children in the UK start smoking every year,’ she said . ‘And while His Royal Highness may not have continued to smoke into adulthood, we know that many children do – in fact over 80 per cent of smokers started in their teens, with almost 40 per cent starting before the age of 16. ‘With parliament due to discuss the issue in the coming weeks, Prince Charles’ admission is a timely reminder that we still need to explore new initiatives for protecting children from the dangers of smoking. ‘Measures such as introducing compulsory standardised packaging for all tobacco products will help prevent tobacco companies from marketing cigarettes to children, and cut the number of children taking up this deadly habit.’","Prince of Wales makes confession while meeting respiratory nurses .

She's become known for her controversial comments during her participation in debates on This Morning. But on Tuesday, Katie Hopkins finally met her match - after facing off against Peaches Geldof in a discussion about attachment parenting. Despite aiming several low blows at Peaches, including referencing a picture of Peaches' son Astala falling out of his pram while the star was on the phone, Katie's argument couldn't stand up to Peaches' comments about the principles of AP. 'The panto witch has finally met her match!' Peaches Geldof shared her joy after winning a debate on attachment parenting against Katie Hopkins on This Morning on Tuesday . Following the incredibly heated debate, Peaches shared a picture of herself and a very sullen-looking Katie on Twitter, writing: 'I think we all know who won. She was quaking in her Sloanie old . boots. The panto witch finally met her match!' She later added: 'Just saw the Hopkins exiting the This Morning studios with her tail between her legs and a traumatised expression on her face. Finally!!' Katie had earlier let rip at mother-of-two Peaches, insisting that her decision to stick to the often controversial movement to raise sons Astala and Phaedra meant that she is a bad mother. Her argument reached a new low when she referenced the now infamous picture of Astala falling out of his pram, saying: 'She likes attachment parenting until her baby is on the pavement.' Heated: Katie and Peaches had a very lively debate about attachment parenting . Defending her corner: Peaches did her utmost to explain the reasons as to why she follows the principles of attachment parenting, while Katie contended otherwise . But Katie's comment didn't go down too well with This Morning hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby stepped in to defend Peaches. Phillip said: 'We've all done that. My daughter fell out of her carry chair when I was looking after her once.' And Peaches replied: 'At least I'm there for my children and not slagging them off in the press, Katie.' The lively debate began with Peaches explaining the principles of attachment parenting to Holly, Phillip and Katie. Almost coming to blows: Peaches refused to let Katie speak during the debate . Stepping in: The pair made no secret of their out-and-out dislike of each other on the show . 'Whatever she says is meaningless': Peaches labelled Katie a 'rent-a-gob' during the show . She said: 'It's sad to me that . this has a name because all it is is a return to instinctive parenting. I . follow the 7 Bs of attachment parenting - birth bonding, breastfeeding, . babywearing, bedding close to baby, belief in the language value of . your baby’s cry, beware of baby trainers and balance.' But Peaches added that while the principles of AP can be as loose or as strict as you like, she does have a routine with her two boys. She said: 'I have a . routine with my child, we have a loose feeding schedule, and they have a . really strict bed time because there are boundaries. 'It's . really not about strict rules - you can pick and choose what you like . about it, it's all inclusive. you can really mix and match.' The post that started it all: Peaches' rage stemmed from Katie sharing this picture and comment about the incident which saw her son Astala fall out of his pram . Peaches was then asked about the fact that her husband Tom Cohen sleeps in a separate bed while she sleeps with the children. She . said: 'With my family it's because I have two babies under 2. One is 17 . months and one is 7 months. We have a bed that is 9ft wide because when . you sleep with your baby you have to be safe.' When . pressed about how the sleeping arrangements affect her sex life, . Peaches replied: 'I have two babies under two so obviously I am doing . something in the bedroom. Hold on a minute: Katie was unimpressed when Peaches jumped in with her own comments as she was speaking . 'Whatever she says is meaningless': Peaches dismissed Katie's remarks without a second thought . 'Just . because I sleep in bed with my babies doesn't mean I'm in bed with them . 24/7. They go to bed at 7, but I don't go to bed at 7. We go to another . bedroom in the house and watch television or do other things couples . do. 'I'm 24 and my husband is 23, we obviously like being intimate with each other!' Phillip . and Holly then gave Katie chance to chime in, with the former . Apprentice star saying: 'It's all a bit ""knit your own Birkenstocks"" for . me. AP is just one step away from CR-AP parenting.' The many faces of Katie Hopkins: The presenter let her frustration show on her face . Head in hands: Peaches also appeared to be finding it frustrating when Katie wouldn't listen to her points . At least she's making herself laugh: Katie aimed several low blows at Peaches during the debate . But Peaches was unwilling to let Katie speak, insisting: 'Whatever you say is meaningless', before adding to Phillip and Holly: 'She's just a rent-a-gob.' Given another chance to step in on the debate, Katie said: 'I . think it's really important that mums are mums and that they are in . control. AP parents thinks it's important that you're there straight . away if the baby cries, . 'But . I think it's important to see that as a mother you put you baby down to . sleep and if they want to cry, then they should go for it.' On . the issue of baby wearing, which sees mothers hold their children close . to them via a sling, Katie said: 'I wear a handbag, I don't wear a . baby. 'You see these women . with 15 metres worth of Indian print fabric, it's always Indian print, . wrapped around their body and somewhere in there there's a mewling baby.' Victory! Peaches looked delighted as she posed up outside the ITV studios before heading home . Just about smiling: Katie's exit appearance was less cheery than Peaches' But Peaches contended: 'It's been going on for generations since mothers were in caves. For . years and years, especially in less economically developed countries, mothers sleep with . their babies and have a wildly less instance of mental health problems and . health problems in general. The reason is because they are doing this thing that says to your baby, ""I love you, I'm there for you"".' [caption .

Wealthy tourists and business travellers visiting the UK could be allowed to skip passport queues by paying a fee to the Home Office, according to new proposals. The plan for 'premium fast-track processing' is one of several proposals outlined yesterday to cover more of the costs of the UK Border Agency by raising cash from foreign visitors. Fast-track processing is already available to some first-class and business-class passengers arriving in the country through Heathrow as well as those arriving via private jets. Premium service: Wealthy tourists and business . travellers visiting the UK could be allowed to skip passport queues by . paying a fee to the Home Office, according to new proposals . The proposed scheme would extend the premium service to other airports. How much passengers would pay was not clear, but a consultation paper published yesterday said the Home Office wanted to 'increase the charges above cost-recovery levels'. It goes on: 'We intend to expand the provision of dedicated VIP suites and premium fast-track processing through the border at certain ports, both of which are currently charged at a cost-recovery level. [...] . 'We will set fees at a level that reflects the value of the product. The income will be used to help fund the immigration system, secure the border and invest in improving processes. 'Fees for some premium services will be charged to the airline or port rather than directly to the travellers, although the airline or port may decide to pass on some, or all, of the cost of those services to travellers.' The Home Office said the scheme was an 'opportunity to expand and enhance the range of premium services to better meet the needs of certain visitors', adding that the premium service would provide 'exclusivity'. Although the scheme would be mainly targeted at wealthy visitors, a spokesman for the department would not rule out it being extended to ordinary holidaymakers later, the Daily Telegraph reported. UK Border Agency officers help a man into a van: The plan for 'premium fast-track processing' is one of several proposals outlined yesterday to cover more of the costs of the agency by raising cash from foreign visitors . The consultation paper gives members of the public three weeks to respond to the proposals, which also include plans to introduce 'premium' services for those seeking long term visas and find new commercial partnerships. The Home Office is to spend £1.75billion on managing the immigration system this financial year, with around half the cost clawed back by fees on applications and services . In the past three years it has processed around 7.5million visa applications and more than two million applications to remain in Britain. Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: 'We believe it is right that those who use and benefit most from the immigration system (migrants and the organisations that sponsor them for work or study) should make an appropriate contribution towards its operation. 'Similarly, those who receive an enhanced service at the border should help meet the cost of providing that service.'","Money raised would help cover the costs of the UK Border Agency .

With hours of intense training each week, there’s no doubt that taking part in Strictly Come Dancing can turn your life upside down... but this is just ridiculous. Hairy Biker Dave Myers, 56, is so determined not to be this year’s ‘comedy act’ that he has taken up anti-gravity yoga to combat his poor posture, on the advice of dance partner Karen Hauer. The 56-year-old television chef, one half of cookery duo The Hairy Bikers, has turned to anti-gravity yoga classes to help improve his chances on the BBC contest. Rush of blood to the head: David Myers, right, hangs out with Strictly partner Karen Hauer . Determined: Dave Myers is determined not to be this year's 'comedy act' on the show . The rather unorthodox exercise classes are said to help improve posture, flexibility and blood flow. The television chef has explained his dance partner Karen Hauer suggested undergoing the workouts earlier this week after Strictly judge Darcey Bussell told him that his poor posture was letting him down during his performances. He revealed that his crooked posture was down to his constant motorbike riding, which has led to backache and sore knees. This Saturday the pair will perform a Salsa routine, with Dave admitting that he does not want to be considered the comedy act of the series. The star, who narrowly avoided elimination in the first week, said: ‘I’m not trying to be a comedy act. It’s a fun dance, it’s not a comedy dance.’ Last weekend, notoriously critical judge Craig Revel Horwood praised the presenter’s Waltz as his personal best. Determination: Dave is trying to counter poor posture born of his motorbike riding . Training: The unorthodox classes are said to help improve posture, flexibility and blood flow . He said recently: ‘It was the best dance I’ve ever done. It felt really good, a grown up, serious dance and there were lots of people with tears in their eyes. It felt good being groomed too. Hopefully I can take that into this week.’ Last year Dave and his Hairy Biker co-star Si King embarked on a campaign to lose two-and-a-half stones in three months for their television show Hairy Dieters: How to Love Food and Lose Weight. They both achieved their targets with Dave adding: ‘Strictly is helping me keep the weight off. I also started off with a bad back and dodgy knees, but Karen has been teaching me posture, how to walk properly and stand straight. Swings and roundabouts: Karen Hauer has been teaching Dave how to walk properly and stand straight . ‘I’ve spent 35 years huddled over a motorbike, and now my back is getting straight, my backache has gone and my knees are great. ‘My Latin trousers which were measured on day one have been taken in twice, much to my joy. It’s the most exercise I’ve done in my life!’ Asked about his chances of winning the competition, he added: ‘If it came to a dance-off the judges have got to judge on technique and I am not going to be as technically wonderful as some of the other fantastic young dancers. ‘You don’t want to let your partner down. ‘Karen is investing 30 hours a week of her teaching time in me – I don’t want to mess it up.’","Dave Myers, 56, took up the bizarre exercise to improve his posture .

"By . Ted Thornhill . PUBLISHED: . 07:08 EST, 25 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:49 EST, 25 October 2013 . The Aussie government has staunchly rejected arguments that climate change is causing the wildfires ravaging eastern parts of the country following a record hot start to the spring season. Prime Minister Tony Abbott described the link as 'complete hogwash' in an interview with News Corp's Australian newspapers. Environment Minister Greg Hunt backed his prime minister, saying no individual event can be linked to climate change. Hot air? Prime Minister Tony Abbott has dismissed claims that global warming was partly responsible for the bushfires . But a climate science organization abolished by Abbott's government released a report on Friday declaring a clear link between climate change and the wildfires. The severity and scale of the fires was unprecedented for this time of year, it said. Last month had been the hottest September on record in New South Wales state. The 12 months preceding it had been the hottest year on record across Australia. The government abolished the state-funded Climate Commission after being elected last month. But the organization survives through public donations as the Climate Council to continue its independent work of communicating reliable information about global warming. A firefighter tries to control flames near houses at Bilpin, 75 kilometers (47 miles) west of Sydney . To deny the influence of climate change on extreme fire weather placed people and property in unnecessarily risky situations, the report warned. The findings are interim, and the final report will be released next month. Will Steffen, a Climate Council member and director of the Australian National University's Climate Change Institute, said he was frustrated that the established science on global warming was not yet accepted in Australia. ‘We'd like to see a discussion in this country that gets beyond these futile debates about the science that have been settled for decades in the scientific literature and get on with the real debate about what is really the best way of dealing with the problem,’ Steffen told reporters. ‘That's where the political debate really needs to be.’ Some scientists are frustrated that the established science on global warming was not yet accepted in Australia . Abbott argues that Australia has experienced wildfires for more than 200 years of European settlement and had suffered worse fires in the past. This week, he accused Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, of ‘talking through her hat’ when she referred to the Australian wildfires as the world ‘paying the price of carbon’ in the atmosphere. ‘They are desperate to find anything that they think might pass as ammunition for their cause,’ Abbott said, referring to people who link the fires to global warming and who criticize his government's climate change policies. Abbott's conservative government plans to repeal laws that force Australia's worst greenhouse gas polluters to pay a tax for every ton of carbon dioxide that they emit. The tax was introduced last year to reduce Australia's abundant greenhouse gas emissions. In this photo provided by the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, smoke rises from a fire near Springwood, west of Sydney . Australia is one of the world's worst greenhouse gas emitters on a per capita basis because of its heavy reliance on cheap coal for power generation. As the world's driest continent after Antarctica, scientists warn that Australia is also particularly vulnerable to climate extremes that come with climate change. A U.N.-created climate change panel issued a major report in Stockholm last month that said it was ‘extremely likely,’ or 95 per cent likely, that global warming was man-made. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the British meteorological office also released research in September that used computer simulations to conclude that climate change influenced some recent weather occurrences in Europe and the United States. The wildfires that have burned around Sydney razed more than 200 homes and resulted in two deaths. One resident died of a heart attack while throwing buckets of water on his home last week, and a pilot died Thursday when his plane crashed while attempting to drop water on flames. Adam Bandt, a lawmaker for the Australian Greens party that champions the carbon tax, was widely accused of politicizing the disaster when be tweeted at the height of the fire emergency last week: ‘Tony Abbott's plan means more bushfires for Australia & more pics like this of Sydney.’ His comment came as television networks were airing images of destroyed homes.","PM Tony Abbott argued that Australia has experienced worse fires before .

An Iranian woman who swam 20km wearing a hijab has been denied the official record because her outfit showed her 'feminine features'. Elham Asghari designed a special 'Islamic' bathing suit adding 6kg to her weight so that she would be allowed to attempt the long-distance swim on the Caspian Sea in June. But the outfit was apparently not modest enough for the country's conservative religious authorities, and her record was not officially recognised. Plea: Elham Asghari was denied a 20km swimming record because of her 'immodest' outfit . The 32-year-old took nine hours to swim the 20km (12.4 miles), setting out from the town of Nowshahr into the freezing waters of the Caspian. She did so in defiance of officials who are opposed to women swimming in open waters because of the risk of displaying their body shapes to men. Even though Ms Asghari wore a loose-fitting swimsuit which included a headscarf, the authorities were opposed to her efforts - and refused to acknowledge that she had made it the full 20km. 'They said no matter how Islamic my swimming gear, it was unacceptable,' she told the Guardian earlier this year. 'They said the feminine features of my body were showing as I came out of water.' Outfit: The 32-year-old was wearing a hijab swimsuit which mostly hid the shape of her body . 'Feminine features': Iranian authorities are keen to discourage women from swimming in open waters . In a bid to gain public support for her battle against the authorities, she made a haunting video of herself swimming around while wearing the swimsuit - which she claims most swimmers would be unable to handle. 'I swam 20km in Nowshahr, they lowered it to 15km,' she says in the video, posted on YouTube. 'I protested and they accepted 18km. Yet now, they do not register the record. 'My 20km record has been held hostage in the hands of people who cannot even swim a distance of 20 metres.' The video then cuts to Ms Asghari sitting in a car wearing a headscarf, when she delivers an inspirational message aimed not just at fellow swimmers but at all women living in the theocratic state. 'I'm not going to submit to bullying, and I ask you not to submit either,' she says. 'I ask you to give your utmost effort to achieve your goals.' Video: Ms Asghari made a haunting YouTube clip in a bid to win public support . Anger: The swimmer has had a number of run-ins with the conservative religious authorities . The Nowshahr incident is not the first time the swimmer has met with official resistance to her athletic activities. During a previous open-water swim, Ms Asghari was blocked by police boats which ended up cutting her legs with their propellers. Women in Iran are allowed to swim in segregated swimming pools, and to compete in the Women's Islamic Games which are held periodically in Tehran. However, they are banned from travelling to competitions abroad, and the authorities frown on swimming in open waters. 'They fear that if they recognise my record then they would unwittingly approve my swimming gear and that would eventually give women swimmers access to open waters,' Ms Asghari told the Guardian. She has expressed hope that the new regime led by Hassan Rouhani might prove more accommodating than that of Mahmoud Ahmedinejad.","Elham Asghari swam 20km on the Caspian Sea wearing special hijab .

Teenage girls see sexualisation as ‘part and parcel’ of their lives because of the raunchy behaviour of pop stars such as Rihanna and Miley Cyrus, an academic claimed yesterday. Their skimpy outfits and sexual dance moves are ruining the self-esteem of girls, according to Professor Dionne Taylor, an expert in criminal law. She found the explicit dance moves and foul-mouthed lyrics fuel negative attitudes towards women and affect women’s confidence, education and even their employment prospects. Scroll down for video . Miley Cyrus sparked criticism after her provocative gyrations with Robin Thicke at the MTV music awards . Professor Taylor’s comments come as Miss Cyrus, 20, promotes her new single Wrecking Ball. The song’s racy video, which features the pop star swinging naked on a demolition ball, was unveiled online just days ago and received more than 19million views within 24 hours. Its release follows Miss Cyrus’s controversial performance at the MTV Music Video Awards last month. The singer paraded on stage in a bra and knickers and gyrated wildly during a duet with Robin Thicke, prompting criticism from parents. Professor Taylor accused stars such as Miss Cyrus of giving ‘mixed messages’ to impressionable young women. The majority of women 15-29 said hyper sexualisation impacted on their confidence and self-esteem . ‘She has appropriated the video vixen persona,’ she added. ‘There was a part where she had backing dancers and she smacked their bottoms. It was ignorant. The men we see in these videos are fully clothed and women are scantily clad.’ Rihanna has repeatedly come under fire for her skimpy clothing and lewd song lyrics. Professor Taylor, a criminal lecturer and researcher, studied black women aged 15 to 29 from Birmingham and London. She said they saw sexualisation as ‘part and parcel of life’ and added that she had experienced the problem first-hand. Rihanna has repeatedly come under fire for her skimpy clothing and lewd song lyrics, and outrageous behaviour . ‘As a teenager I was told, “you’ve got a big bum” – the focus was always on my body parts. ‘There was a feeling that you had to conform in some ways to these images to be worthwhile. ‘I have a younger sister and she used to say she didn’t feel confident in herself and that was mainly derived from popular black music genres. ‘The majority of my participants said the hyper-sexualisation of music videos and magazines impacted on their confidence, education and employment. It damaged their self-esteem.’ An independent review into the sexualisation of childhood, carried out by Mothers’ Union chief executive Reg Bailey in 2011, recommended that the Government introduce age ratings on music videos. Last year music mogul Mike Stock, who wrote Kylie Minogue’s hit single I Should Be So Lucky, also complained about the ‘sluttish’ lyrics of pop music, in particular those of Lady Gaga. Mr Stock said: ‘It’s easy – if you haven’t got much of a sell, stick some sex in the video and it’s job done. It’s both easy and lazy. ‘It’s largely the Americans, to be honest – the new breed of rap and Lady Gaga types. They’re all just sluttish. ‘And young girls think they are someone worth emulating.’ Taylor says the part where she had black backing dancers and she smacked their bottoms was ignorant .

Liz says the message Rihanna sends to young fans, through lyrics, dance moves and Twitter, is toxic . 'Young women are far more impressionable than young men. They want to be Rihanna, have her lifestyle, her clothes, her men, her habits. I . wish she’d stop infecting our High Streets with her gun tattoos, her . false nails and fake hair, her bogus bad-ass shenanigans that try to . portray her as ‘real’, as ‘street’, as her own person, as strong and . single-minded. 'While Rihanna knows when to tone it down in order to pull in advertising deals and keep her record label sweet - so much so that she has enough dollar bills to use them as a carpet, and so many diamonds she can pretend to smoke them in a spliff, both things she's been pictured doing - the message she's sending to her young fans, through her explicit lyrics, vile dance moves and pictures on Twitter, is utterly toxic. This poisonous pop princess should come with a government health warning.' August 2013 . Shona Sibary is astounded at her daughter's blase reaction to Miley's VMAs twerking performance. Shona's daughter Flo thought that Miley and Robin's performance was 'quite a cool act' 'What stunned me even more than Miley's excruciating display of pornographic innuendo was my daughter's reaction. For rather than sharing my dismay at the route her once favourite TV star has taken, Flo's response to the debacle was that it was 'quite a cool act'. 'It is this insouciance, this almost jaded retort from my teenage daughter at what was blatantly a dance routine choreographed to cause offence that, as a mother, I find so disturbing. Yes, of course, Miley Cyrus is 20 and no longer a teenager. And it's nothing if not predictable that she is hell-bent on letting the world know it. But what of her fans - those girls who, just like Flo, loved Miley as children and are on the brink of womanhood themselves? I can't help but feel they are on the receiving end of a seemingly endless barrage of sexual imagery.' The Parents Television Council issued a statement in which executes called Miley Cyrus' performance 'twerking' on stage in a flash-colored latex bikini 'sexually exploitative' and said it 'simply substituted talent with sex.' The Family Television Council, a non-profit group, blasted MTV for allowing the show to air and demanded 'heads should roll' at the cable network. A member of the Council's advisory board, former BET network executive Paul Porter, said: 'The Miley Cyrus/Robin Thicke performance simply substituted talent with sex... While the performance was shocking to the audience, MTV approved it during the show run prior to the broadcast. Dan Isett, public policy director for the Parents Television Council called on Congress to change cable TV rules as he criticized MTV. He singled out Miley's on-stage performance. 'MTV continues to sexually exploit young women by promoting acts that incorporate 'twerking' in a nude-colored bikini.

Schultz, 63. All three are accused of a 'conspiracy of silence' for allegedly covering up the abuse and refusing to report it to police in an effort to protect the highly lucrative Penn State football program. Their actions, prosecutors say, allowed Sandusky to continue molesting young boys he recruited and groomed through his charity 'The Second Mile.' McQueary says he told Paterno, Curley and Schultz in February 2001 that he had witnessed Sandusky raping a young boy in the showers at a practice facility. Prosecutors allege that the three top administrators . 'I had seen Jerry Sandusky engaged in a very bad sexual act, a molestation act, with a minor,' McQueary testified he told Paterno. He also testified that he told other university officials about the incident - including two of the three officials appearing at Monday's hearing. None reported it to police. Charged: Former president Graham Spanier, top, former vice president Gary Schultz, left, and former athletic director Tim Curley are on trial . Sandusky, 69, a former assistant football coach, was convicted in June 2012 of 45 counts of sexual abuse involving 10 boys. He is serving a sentence of 30 years to 60 years in a state prison. McQueary lost his job as a receivers coach after charges were filed against Sandusky in November 2011. McQueary, who testified he also told Curley and Schultz of the shower incident, said Paterno told him in the months following the shower incident 'Old Main screwed up,' using a nickname for the administrative center of Penn State. Sandusky was arrested in November 2011 and charged with molesting boys. A year later, in November 2012, a grand jury charged Spanier, Curley and Schultz with endangering the welfare of children, criminal conspiracy and obstruction of justice. Spanier also was charged with perjury. Curley and Schultz were previously charged in November 2011 with perjury and failure to report suspected abuse. Spanier was fired from Penn State; Curley was placed on administrative leave and Schultz had already retired from the school. Graham Spanier, who was fired as president of Penn State, says he was never told of the sex abuse allegations . Harrisburg District Judge William Wenner will decide if there is enough evidence to bring the case to trial after the preliminary hearing. Within weeks of Sandusky's arrest, Penn State Trustees fired Spanier, at the time the nation's highest-paid public university president. Trustees also fired Paterno, Sandusky's boss. Months later, Paterno, a legendary figure in college football died of lung cancer at the age of 85. Civil lawsuits filed by the victims, now grown men, against the university are close to being settled, with the school putting aside $60 million to cover the claims, according to a lawyer for one of the plaintiffs. The attorney said there were as many as 32 claims from alleged victims. McQueary also has filed a whistleblower and defamation lawsuit against Penn State, accusing the school of not renewing his contract because he cooperated with authorities investigating Sandusky and the Penn State officials. And, Spanier's lawyers have served legal notice that they intend to file defamation charges against Louis Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Freeh was the author of a study, commissioned by the university, spelling out a narrative of the scandal that many in the state rejected, including the Paterno family. The Freeh report prompted the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the governing body for college sports, to issue sanctions against Penn State. The NCAA imposed a $60 million fine and voided the 14 seasons of football victories Sandusky coached.","Former Penn State President Graham Spanier, former athletic director Tim Curley and former vice president Gary Schultz are accused of a coverup .

They go to drink cheap beer and have a good time but a new BBC documentary has revealed men could come home with more (or less in the case of their finances) than they bargained for after a stag party in Prague. In Sex, Stags and Prague, which airs on BBC Three this evening, Stacey Dooley visits the Czech capital which has become a 'mecca' for men on the cusp of married life. It's not a surprise to learn they are . lured by the cut price alcohol and the prevalence of strip clubs . - where they can get a lap dance for £35 and pay for extras. Eye-opener: Stacey Dooley visited Prague to discover what really happens on a man's 'last night of freedom' Let loose: Stacey found many British men like this group are just after some harmless fun but others get into trouble when they drink too much . But she also wanted to find out 'what . life is really like for the thousands of girls paid to entertain the . stags and the authorities trying to keep the stags out of trouble'. Plus she 'gets the . low down from those who clean up after them, tracks down the criminals . who prey on them and find out what really goes on on a man's last night . of freedom.' After what she learnt speaking to sex workers, Stacey said many brides-to-be may want to put their foot down if their fiance suggests going to Prague for their stag do. Making money: When strippers met the presenter they said they didn't feel exploited . Prostitution is legal in the city but running a brothel is not. However, Stacey discovered many establishments get around this by thinly disguised them as strip clubs and massage parlours. One sex worker told Stacey that in her experience, five out of ten men on stag do will sleep with a prostitute - and one of the five will 'always' be the stag. But what really alarmed Stacey was the number who demand unprotected sex despite the risk of catching an STD. 'If the girl tell him she is HIV . positive, he still wants sex without condom. They have no brain. It's like . bungee jumping, it's a thrill, will I or won't I catch it' One prostitute said a third of her clients ask for unprotected sex - and will offer to pay extra for it. To support the sex workers and ensure they are safer, Hana Malinova set up the organisation - Bliss Without Risks - in Prague. She visits prositiutes in an amulance to test them for HIV and other STDs. She said 'a lot' of men will try to convince a woman to have sex without a condom. 'If the girl tell him she is HIV . positive, he still wants sex without condom. They have no brain. It's like . bungee jumping, it's a thrill, will I or won't I catch it,' she said. In danger: Stacey was shown footage of one drunk who climbed a statute in Wenceslas Square and then fell off - resulting in a serious injury . Stacey said: 'I'd be devastated . if my boyfriend came to Prague with the boys and got carried away and . had unprotected sex with a prostitute and then had sex with me and gave . me an STD. It's not a joke.' But it's not just through sexual indulgence that men are putting themselves at risk when partying in Prague. The copious amounts of alcohol they drink inevitably leads to trouble. Stacey visited the police who monitor the city and regularly encounter men falling over and injurying themselves after having one too many. They showed her footage of one drunken man who had climbed a 15m high statue in Wenceslas Square and then fell off - resulting in a serious injury. 'The locals hate seeing people peeing, puking and being undressed on the street. But they do spend money and . the economy needs it' Their inebriated state also makes them easy targets for thieves. Convicted pickpockets admitted to Stacey that they could make thousands of pounds a night by taking wallets from the back pockets of oblivious tourists. Some prostitutes also admitted that they would gain extra payment by stealling from their clients. Other women stole by offering to have sex, then drugging men and taking their money. Some stags admitted to Stacey that they felt uncomfortable with the pressure to take drugs whilst in the city. And those who succumbed might not even get drugs at all. Con artists fooled tourists to part with their cash by selling them 'drugs' which could actually be pine cones. The police said they are often powerless to act because men are too embarrassed to report such crimes, or are too drunk to realise they have been the victim of a theft or con before it's too late - so there's no proof. Stacey found the drinking culture of Brits abroad can also cause havoc for the locals. One hotel said they will make stag parties leave a deposit because the rooms are often wrecked - usually by groups of British men. Good for the economy: The average stag spends £500 while in Prague . The manageress explained: 'About three weeks ago we had a . British stag group that got so pissed they kicked the door and wrecked . the whole frame. British stags are the worst.' But she added that many locals simply put up with it because they know it's good for business - on average each stag can spend £500 during their time in Prague. 'They know they (the stags) bring money and tourism is . important. But on the other hand they hate seeing people peeing and . puking and being undressed on the street. But they do spend money and . the economy needs it,' the hotel manager said. A stripper revealed the 'worse part about the job is when a group is really drunk and doesn't know how to behave'. But Stacey said many of the strippers don't feel explioted because 'they say they have the upper hand, they are earning five times more than they would doing a regular job.' After her eye-opening weekend, Stacey admitted men should be careful when letting lose on their stag dos. 'Some are having harmless . fun but there's another side that I massively underestimated - the . amount of brothels and prosititutes, the pick pocketing and the drugs,' she said.

The decade that gave us Kurt Cobain, Kate 'n Johnny and a love of all things grunge is making a fashion come-back. The fashion scene has been dominated by Nineties punk and grunge inspired styles this autumn and it seems that we just can't get enough of the dark-loving decade. High Street stores and e-tailers have seen sales of grunge-inspired items soar, with sales of the grungy biker boot rising by more than double since last month, making them the nation's number one shoe of choice this season. The 90s are back with a bang: The grunge trend is one of the most popular the only look to embrace this season - just ask Miley Cyrus and Little Mix - and sales of grunge styles are soaring . Inspired by the likes of Miley Cyrus, Gwen Stefani, Perrie Edwards and Jessie J, women across the UK have ditched their high heels in favour of heavy lace-ups. Sales of black Dr Martens have shot up by 65 per cent on eBay, followed closely by dark blue and red coloured boots.

Lorna Tulloch pinned the pensioner against some steps with her van, before poking her fingers into his eyes and tried to stab him in the stomach, a court heard . A reality TV row over an 'unfaithful' husband ended with a jealous wife in court after she tried to run him and his father over with her giant camper van, a  court heard. Lorna and Michael Tulloch appeared on the 'The Jeremy Kyle Show' in July, 2012 after she accused him of a string of infidelities. However Kyle wasn't able to resolve the couple's differences and weeks later Tulloch drove her giant Fiat Ducato camper van to the distillery cottages where her father-in-law Gordon Tulloch, 77, lived and confronted the pensioner. She pinned the pensioner against some steps with her van, before poking her fingers into his eyes and tried to stab him in the stomach. At the High Court case, in Inverness, Lord Jones heard the bizarre details of the attack from advocate depute Shanti Maguire. Tulloch, of Forres, admitted an indictment of assaulting both men by driving the N registered vehicle at them in the grounds of the Glenburgie Distillery in Forres on August 8, 2012 and stabbing Mr Tulloch senior. She was originally charged with attempted murder. Tulloch also had her not guilty pleas accepted to assaulting her husband and father-in-law on three other occasions between January 1, 2003 and July 25, 2012. Ms Maguire told the judge that Tulloch and her estranged 53-year-old husband had been on the TV show weeks before the offence. 'The accused and Michael had been at odds for some time which culminated in their separation. There is a long standing history of troubles within the marriage including allegations of infidelity on the part of Michael. The estranged wife turned the camper van round and drove towards Gordon Tulloch, pictured, and repeatedly tried to run him over, the court heard . 'He denies any such infidelity. These allegations culminated in the couple appearing on the Jeremy Kyle show a few weeks before this offence. 'It is understood arguments continued between the parties until the date of this offence. 'Around 12.30pm on August 8, Gordon Tulloch was walking his dog in the distillery and his wife, Annie and Michael were in the parents' home. At the time, Lorna Tulloch lived next door.' The court was told she drove the van into the distillery and she spoke to Mr Tulloch senior before driving away. Ms Maguire went on: 'He gesticulated to the rear of the vehicle, gave her the 'V' sing and shouted 'p*** off.' 'She turned the camper van round and drove towards Gordon Tulloch and made repeated attempts to run him over. He ran away and maneouvered his way out of her path.' The van, being driven at 25mph, collided with three walls as she constantly turned and reversed to try and hit Mr Tulloch, before she eventually managed to pin him in to a set of steps. Kyle wasn't able to resolve the couple's difference and weeks later Tulloch attempted to run over her father-in-law . Lorna then shouted at him: 'I have got you now. You are a brave man with an audience but when your yersel you're a coward.' She then scratched his face, pulled his hair and poked her fingers into his eyes before producing a five inch bladed knife tied to her wrist with a shoelace and tried to stab him twice in the stomach. Ms Maguire said Mr Tulloch senior tried to defend himself and sustained injuries to his ear, fingers and right eye. 'These were not life-threatening. Michael Tulloch came to look for his father who told him: ""She's stabbed me and tried to run me over"". 'He then helped his father back towards his house when he saw the vehicle being drive towards them, but he managed to get his father home before the accused drove away.' Lorna Tulloch later told a neighbour: 'I tried to run him over, what am I supposed to do, some folk cannae leave it alone. 'Every time I came out the door he's at me, what am I supposed to do. I tried to stab him.' Mr Tulloch senior and his son gave victim impact statements which were shown to the judge. Ms Maguire said: 'Both men fear meeting or seeing the accused again.' Her defence counsel Shahid Latif said he would reserve his plea of mitigation on the first offender until obligatory reports were prepared. Lord Jones continued her bail but ordered to stay away from the distillery and the Tulloch family. The Jeremy Kyle show that they appeared on will not be aired because of legal reasons. She will be sentenced on December 11.

A breakthrough by British scientists has been hailed as a turning point in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease. The landmark study also raises the prospect of new drugs for other brain conditions, including Parkinson’s and motor neurone disease. It may even be possible to create one pill that treats several diseases. The work is still at an early stage but is described as the first real evidence that it is possible to use a drug to stop diseased brain cells from dying. A breakthrough by British scientists has been hailed as a turning point in the fight against Alzheimer's disease . Professor Roger Morris, of King’s College London, said: ‘This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer’s disease.’ In Alzheimer’s disease, which affects 500,000 Britons, brains are clogged up by a sticky, ‘mis-folded’ protein. Most scientists are trying to find drugs that break up the toxic protein and clear it from the brain, but the latest study, from scientists funded by the Medical Research Council, tackled the problem in a different way. Rather than trying to declog the brain, they looked at how mis-folded proteins damage it. In much the same way as a deck-chair needs to be opened and closed in a certain way, the proteins in our cells have to be folded in a certain way if they are to work properly. Research on mice showed that mis-shapen proteins do not directly kill brain cells. Instead, cells die because in a misguided attempt to protect themselves, they stop making new proteins – including some vital for their survival. The researchers showed it was possible . to give mice a drug that switches protein production back on, and stops . brain disease in its tracks. Treated mice stayed symptom-free, while untreated animals developed . memory and movement problems and eventually died, the journal Science . Translational Medicine reports. Lead scientist Giovanna Mallucci, of the . University of Leicester, said: ‘It was very striking. The treated mice . were completely protected. More importantly, their brains were . completely protected.’ The work is still at a very early stage but is described as the first real evidence that it is possible to use a drug to stop diseased cells from dying. Image shows the structural abnormalities of Alzheimer's . The tests were on the mis-folded brain protein called a prion which . causes scrapie, a fatal, degenerative disease that affects the nervous . systems of sheep and goats. But it is thought a similar process is . behind several other brain diseases, including Alzheimer’s, motor . neurone and Parkinson’s diseases. However, the drug had severe side-effects and any new treatments for people are at least a decade away. Prof Morris said: ‘This is the first convincing report that a small . drug, of the type most conveniently turned into medicines, stops the . progressive death of neurons in the brain as found, for instance, in . Alzheimer’s disease. ‘True, this study has been done in mice, not in man; and it is a prion disease, not Alzheimer’s, that has been cured. ‘But there is considerable evidence that the way neurons die in both diseases is similar.’ Professor Hugh Perry, chairman of the MRC’s neuroscience and mental . health board, said: ‘Despite the toxicity of the compound used, this . study indicates that, in mice at least, we have proof of principle of a . therapeutic pathway that can be targeted. ‘This might eventually aid the development of drugs to treat people . suffering from dementias and other devastating neurodegenerative . diseases.’ Dr Eric Karran, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘Targeting a mechanism . relevant to a number of degenerative diseases could yield a single drug . with wide-reaching benefits. ‘However, what is true in animals does not always hold true in people . and the ultimate test for this compound will be to see whether it is . safe and effective in people with these diseases.’","The study also raises the possibility of new drugs to treat brain conditions like Parkinson's and motor neurone disease, as well as Alzheimer's .

During a Q&A session at the Lincoln Center in New York with friend and actress Jessica Chastain, the 80-year-old Chanel designer said of the pet: 'She’s helped me to become a nicer person. There’s something very touching about her. Even if she is spoiled beyond.' He added that the gray and white feline is the perfect companion because having a dog would require going out for walks - something he prefers not to do, being so 'recognizable.' Fashion legend: Karl Lagerfeld has got a fearsome reputation for intimidating people - but last night he revealed that he's learning to soften up, thanks to his Persian cat Choupette . 'I cannot walk in the street anymore, . I’m too easy to recognize . . . It's a nightmare,' he said, sat dressed . in his signature black pants, blazer, high-collared white shirt and . leather fingerless gloves. Ms Chastain, 36, who was wearing a bejeweled Chanel cocktail dress for the occasion, said she is yet to meet Choupette but has heard many stories about her. The pet belonged to one of Mr Lagerfeld's friends originally. But after he cat-sat for two weeks, he refused to let her go. '[She] is the most beautiful cat in the world . .  [and] very clean,' he mused. With no spouse or children, Mr Lagerfeld joked earlier this year that he would marry the animal if he could. 'I cannot walk in the street anymore, I'm too easy to recognize . . . It's a nightmare' During last night's 40-minute conversation with Ms Chastain, Mr Lagerfeld also opened up about the way fashion has changed over his six-decade-long career. He said the 'role of the red carpet' and Photoshop have had a huge impact on the industry. 'The red carpet is not fashion; it’s always the same silhouette,' he observed. 'Fashion is something else than the red carpet, but the red carpet is a part of our world, our fashion world… It [can be] a little too much sometimes. Ladies' man: Mr Lagerfeld pictured with his friends, Harper's Bazaar editor Glenda Bailey (left) and actress Jessica Chastain (right) at the Lincoln Center in New York . As for Photoshop, he said: '[We are] easily in a period of over-retouching. 'Some models [end up] look[ing] as if they are coming out of a funeral parlor, all life taken out of the face, I hate that.' He also touched on how fashion design has lost some of its magic. 'Lots of designers these days don’t sketch anymore. 'Choupette is the most beautiful cat in the world and very clean- she helped me become a nicer person' 'They have studios [or] do it with a computer. I do everything myself because I like physically the work of sketching.' Despite his charismatic and mysterious demeanor, Mr Lagerfeld went on to describe himself as being 'boring' behind closed doors. He explained that he does not drink, smoke or do drugs, likes to . get seven hours of sleep a night, and prefers to stay indoors away from the public. He . continued: 'I would hate to be friends with people like me, that's too . boring', adding that he 'admires people who destroy themselves.' Despite the 'dullness', Mr Lagerfeld summed up his life as being 'quite pleasant'.

Look of love: With no spouse or children, Mr Lagerfeld joked he would marry the feline if was a possibility . Indeed, thanks to his career success, he is able to afford the luxury . of having two houses in Paris - one for work, one for sleep - and a bank . balance topping millions of dollars. He . explained that he was ambitious from a young age - teaching himself . four languages by the time he was six - and today he considers fashion . as a round-the-clock occupation. 'I would hate to be friends with people like me, that's too boring - I admire people who destroy themselves' During the night he says he often wakes up to make notes in a sketch book, which he keeps close to his pillow. He added that his 'tough' mother never attended one of his shows, and in her later years she shunned his designs in favor of Sonia Rykiel's. Despite his self-deprecating remarks, friends of Mr Lagerfeld's, present at the event, described him as anything but 'boring'. British-born Harper's Bazaar . editor Glenda Bailey - who coordinated the Q&A session - said she had known the German fashion legend for about 27 years and was 'in awe of him' long before they met.

A study found that people who eat a lot of carbohydrates are more likely to be diagnosed with depression . Many people turn to a big plate of pasta for comfort when they are feeling down - but new research suggests this could do more harm than good. A study found that people who eat a lot of carbohydrates are more likely to be diagnosed with depression. Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health conducted a 12 year study into the relationship between carbohydrate consumption and depression. They recruited 43,000 women with no history of depression and asked them about their diets, Medical Daily reports. The results showed that women who eat a lot of red meat, pasta, bread and chips are between 29 and 41 per cent more likely to develop depression. It also found that those who consume olive oil, coffee, wine and fish are less likely to suffer from low moods. The researchers were unable to say whether carbs caused depression - or if people simply turned to them when they felt low. Previous research by Dr Judith Wurtman, a former scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and her husband, Dr Richard Wurtman, has suggested that people crave carbohydrates when the levels of the feel-good hormone, serotonin, fall in their brains - such as during that mid afternoon slump. 'We discovered years and years ago that many people experience the ""universal carbohydrate craving time"" between 3:30 p.m. and 5 p.m. every day,' WedMD reports. 'I suspect the tradition of English tea with its carb offering is a ritual developed to fill this need.' However, other experts disagree with the Wurtmans. Dr Edward Abramson, a professor emeritus at California State University, believes that people eat carbohydrates because they are already depressed - and turn to them as comfort food. The results showed that women who eat a lot of red meat, pasta, bread and chips are between 29 and 41 per cent more likely to develop depression . Previous research has also revealed that sugary food can exacerbate depression as it provides a 'quick fix' - but then results in a . sugar crash that can make people feel worse. ‘We . tend to crave sugary and fatty foods for a quick mood fix, but the . sugar crash that follows could make you feel worse,’ explains Helen . Bond, of the British Dietetic Association. ‘Our mood is determined by a steady supply of energy from blood glucose to the brains.’ Helen Bond explained that to avoid depression people should try to eat foods that release their energy slowly.","Women who eat a lot of red meat and carbohydrates - such as chips, pasta and bread - are 29 to 41% more likely to be diagnosed with depression .

The house where author Rudyard Kipling wrote some of his most famous novels is on the market for the first time in 40 years, complete with its own cricket pitch. The Gables, in Tisbury, Wiltshire, was home to the author's parents for nearly 20 years, and Kipling wrote several of his masterpieces there, including Kim. Kipling, whose works include The Jungle Book and Just So Stories, lived in Sussex, but would often come to stay with his parents for weeks at a time when he was working. Rudyard Kipling often stayed with his parents at The Gables, which is for sale for £950,000, for weeks at a time . The house (circled in red) where Rudyard Kipling wrote some of his most famous novels comes with its very own cricket pitch (circled in blue) Now the five-bedroomed house the English writer knew so well is on the market for just shy of £1m at £950,000. The mid-19th century property is made of local Chilmark stone and comes complete with 3.7 acres of sprawling land, including a tennis court and perfectly manicured cricket pitch. It was bought by his parents, Alice and John Kipling, when they returned to England after a long spell in India. They purchased the detached house as their son's writing star was on the rise, and he would travel from his Sussex house near Burwash, Batemans, to work there free from distraction. It was during one of these many trips to Tisbury that Kipling largely wrote the novel considered by most to be his masterpiece, Kim. His father contributed the illustrations for the tale of the Anglo-Indian beggar boy in Lahore in the 1890s, and used drawings of one of the pupils from Tisbury Boys' School as the model for the main character.

Rudyard Kipling would spend weeks at at a time working at his parents' house, free from distraction . The house is currently owned by John and Louise Young, who have lived there since the early 1970s, and is being sold by Strutt & Parker's Salisbury office. A spokesman for Strutt & Parker said: 'The Kipling parents were often visited here by their famous son, and while Rudyard was working on his novel Kim his father John, who illustrated it, used drawings of one of the pupils at Tisbury Boys' School as the model for the main character.' The house is going on the market at the same time as it emerged that academics in the US have discovered 50 previously unpublished works dating from a time when Kipling and his wife tried, unsuccessfully, to settle in America. Kipling was the first English-language writer to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, at 42, and is still its youngest ever recipient. Rudyard Kipling's parents settled at The Gables after many years in India, and were happy there . Joseph Rudyard Kipling was born in 1865 in Bombay to his British colonial parents, John and Alice Kipling.  His father was an artist and worked at the Jeejeebhoy School Of Art in Bombay, and young Rudyard and his sister enjoyed exploring local markets with their nanny. When Kipling was six, his mother decided he needed an English education and sent him to live with a cruel foster family, the Holloways, while he attended school in Southsea.  Mrs Holloway beat and bullied him and he struggled to fit in at school, finding comfort only in books. At the age of 11, Kipling was on the verge of a nervous breakdown, so a family friend contacted his mother and she rushed over from India and removed him from the Holloways' clutches. The Jungle Book, left, and Just So Stories, right, are still two of the most famous children's books ever written . After finishing his schooling in Devon, Kipling returned to India to work on a local newspaper.  He also began to write short stories, and published a collection of them, entitled Plain Tales From The Hills, in 1888, just after his 22nd birthday. As Kipling's writing career burgeoned, he returned to England to great acclaim, having taken the scenic route to get there, via a long detour to North America. The author's arrival in London was met with great acclaim, and he met and became friends with American agent and publisher Wolcott Balestier, at around the same time as he published The Light That Failed. Kipling fell in love with Balestier's sister Carrie, and married her in London in 1891.  The newlyweds moved to America and had a baby girl, Josephine, shortly after settling in Vermont in a house called Bliss Cottage. Rudyard Kipling and his wife Carrie in a carriage on their way to meet the King and Queen at Buckingham Palace, date unknown . It was in this cottage that Kipling began work on what would become the Jungle Books - he had an idea about a boy who was brought up by wolves. In four years Kipling produced a series of Jungle Books, and a second daughter, Elsie, was born in 1896.  His tales of and for children won huge acclaim, and by the age of 32, Kipling was the highest-paid writer in the world. A legal scandal sent the Kiplings back to England, and another child, a son, John, was born in 1897.  But tragedy struck when the Kiplings sailed back across the Atlantic to visit Carrie's mother: Rudyard and his elder daughter became seriously ill with pneumonia, and the child died.  It was said Kipling never got over the tragedy. The Kiplings returned to England and the picaresque novel Kim was serialised in a magazine and then published in book form in 1901. In 1902 Kipling bought Batemans, a house dating back to 1634.  Here, the author began to find some happiness again, and published his Just So Stories, which he had crafted for his late daughter as he put her to bed.  The name came from his daughter's request for her father to repeat his stories for her just as he had first told them, or 'Just So'. Batemans, the Kipling family's home in Burwash, Sussex, was were the author found some peace after losing his daughter . In 1907 he won the Nobel Prize for Literature - the first English-language recipient - and in 1906 he published Puck Of Pook's Hill and Rewards And Fairies, which contained the poem If, came in 1910. In 1915 Kipling travelled to France to report on the First World War, and his son John, to whom he had become very close in the wake of Josephine's death and for whom If was written, signed up with the Irish Guards thanks to his father pulling strings. In October of that year the family heard John had gone missing in France but no trace of him was found.  Kipling felt so guilty about encouraging his son to sign up, he went to France to search for him but no trace was ever found. Kipling continued to write but, with two of his three children dead, had lost the will to write the children's stories that had made his name.  He died in 1936 and his ashes were buried at Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey.","The Gables in Tisbury, Wilts, was home to his parents for nearly 20 years .

The parents of conjoined twins revealed today the agonizing decisions they faced after a routine ultrasound during pregnancy left them fearing for their unborn sons' lives. Jenni Ezell and her husband Daze, from Guthrie, Oklahoma, were given the devastating news during a sonogram in March that their baby boys were joined at the abdomen and shared vital organs. Their own research only confirmed the couple's fears - their babies only had a 5 per cent chance of living a healthy life if they were separated. The heartbroken parents considered a termination. Scroll down for video . Owen and Emmett Ezell, seen in this picture posted on their Facebook page on November 3, were born joined at the abdomen but have come on leaps and bounds since their life-saving surgery . Jenni Ezell and her husband Daze, from Guthrie, Oklahoma, were told during a routine sonogram earlier this year that their babies were joined at the abdomen . Mrs Ezell told News9: 'We wanted to save them from the pain and hurt that they would feel.' However the couple soon had a change of heart after a doctor convinced them that their boys, who shared a liver and intestines, had a fighting chance. A specialist at Medical City Dallas renewed their faith, telling them: 'These boys have a really good chance. This is not your only option.' Mrs Ezell gave birth to conjoined boys Emmett and Owen on July 15. Doctors advised that separation surgery was possible but risky - out of eight similar operations, only once did both twins survive. The couple, who have two . other sons, moved to Dallas for the boys' medical care and were able to say goodbye before the boys were taken into surgery. Success: One of the twin boys shortly after an 11-hour operation which successfully separated them . 'As a mother, I hope I never have to . experience a moment like that again,' Mrs Ezell wrote in her 'Ezell . Twins' blog. On August 24, an 11-hour operation successfully separated the boys. At a news conference following the surgery, Mrs Ezell said: 'I have two babies … two separate babies!' Her husband added: 'A couple of pretty good looking babies, I’d say.' Owen and Emmett, are now almost four months old and remain at Medical City Children's Hospital in Dallas, Texas where they will be for several more months.

Brotherly love: Jenni watches as her eldest son Ethan comforts his little brothers Owen and Emmett, who shared a liver and some of their digestive system . They will need further surgeries in the future; after they are two, the boys will require 'skin expanders' for their wounds. Another operation will require surgeons to pull abdominal muscles into place, which should leave them with only a neat line of a scar. After this, if the parents wish, they can opt for the boys to have a third surgery to create a belly button for each of them. Marvel: An ultrasound shows the boys attached at the abdomen while in Jennie's womb . Early days: The babies shortly after their birth on July 15 . Roughly one out of every 200,000 live births worldwide results in conjoined twins, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. Around 40 to 60 per cent of conjoined twins arrive stillborn, and about 35 per cent survive only one day. The survival rate is between 5 per cent and 25 per cent, the Center reported. The condition is three times more likely to occur among females than males and a third of conjoined twins are attached at the lower chest, sharing organs. Chances of successful surgery and survival are greater if the twins have separate sets of organs, experts say. Although success rates have improved over the years, surgical separation is still rare. Since 1950, at least one twin has survived separation about 75 percent of the time. After separation, most twins need intensive rehabilitation because of the malformation and position of their spines. Although risky, there are many stories of successful separations. Most recently, Utah twins Kendra and Maliyah Herrin, who were born sharing an abdomen, pelvis, liver, kidney, large intestine and two legs, just celebrated seven years since they were separated aged four. Their family said the girls, who are learning to walk with the aid of prosthetics, are the happiest and healthiest they have ever been.","Owen and Emmett Ezell shared a liver and intestines when they were born .

Accused pervert: Cliff Oshman sent profane, sexually charged emails to an u8ndercover officer he thought was a 14-year-old girl. A 64-year-old Florida man was arrested Friday after bringing his family to meet a 14-year-old girl he’d be grooming for months to join them in group sex. Cliff Oshman, of Daytona Beach, went to a local grocery store to meet the young girl, wife and young daughter in tow, only to find out ‘she’ was an undercover cop – the depraved man was arrested and charged with multiple offenses. Mr Oshman initially made contact with the undercover officer through an ad placed online looking for someone willing to have sex with his family. He and the police officer chatted for seven months before agreeing to meet, according to the Orlando Sentinel. The perverse patriarch’s original online ad ‘was looking for someone to add to his cozy family and that the age of the person did not matter,’ said an arrest report reviewed by MailOnline. An undercover cop responded, posing as a 14-year-old girl, and was subjected to chats from March until this week about Mr Oshman’s desire to have a sexual relationship with a young girl, according to the arrest report. Even worse, his family was in on the scheme. ‘The wife and daughter were given a ride to the police department and during that ride [his wife] told detectives that the defendant and she were supposed to meet a 14-year-old girl for sex,’ the arrest report said. Reading like a chat log from NBC’s ‘Dateline: To Catch a Predator’ television series, the deranged man wrote about his impulses and fantasies, but also expressed concern over being caught. The accused pedophile wrote in emails to the undercover officer about fantasizing that while with his wife, he was really having sex with the young girl, according to the arrest report. The man wrote of want to taste and see the young girl unclothed, about various sex acts he wanted to perform on her and sent several pictures of his genitalia to the officer, the arrest report said, detailing the explicit, profane emails. End of the line: Mr Oshman was arrested trying to meet the 14-year-old girl at this Daytona, FL., shopping plaza . Mr Oshman then discussed via email how sleeping with the young girl without being arrested might work. ‘If you get caught with me, they arrest me… when people discover we are lovers, and find out your age, there will certainly be a scandal,’ Mr Oshman said, according to the arrest report. ‘We need to make a plan to handle it OK ... I sincerely would love you to be in my life,’ he continued. Mr Oshman faces a litany of felony charges for his actions including using a computer to solicit a child for sex, traveling to solicit a child for sex, two counts of transmitting images harmful to a child and using a two-way communication device to commit a felony. Mr Oshman does not appear to have a prior criminal history, according to records. It also is not clear if Mr Oshman's wife faces any charges for aiding and abetting his plans.","Cliff Oshman, 64, was arrested after trying to meet a young girl for sex that turned out to be an undercover officer .

A zoo has renamed a Cuban crocodile called 'Fidel' after visitors complained about it being named after the communist revolutionary Fidel Castro. The reptile is one of seven baby crocs born at the wildlife centre in Hoyerswerdain Saxony, Germany. After they hatched, zookeepers chose to give the animals names associated with Cuba, so that visitors were aware of their country of origin. Controversial Croc: Fidel is one of seven baby crocodiles which were born at the zoo in Saxony . Cuban President Fidel Castro, above, led a bloody revolution to overthrow General Batista in the 1950s . But some tourists did not see the funny side of the feisty animal's name, saying it trivialised the actions of Castro who led a bloody uprising in Cuba in the 1950s and became the country's dictatorial leader soon after. Carmen Lötsch, director of the zoo defended the decision, saying the name was not meant to 'glorify' the communist leader. She said: 'Nobody intended it to be a direct reference to dictator Fidel Castro or indeed a glorification of him as a person', she said. But a government finance and culture committee who handles funding for the park did not agree with the zookeeper's claim that the name was harmless. The body, who last year allocated gave the zoo a grant of 40,000 Euros ordered for Fidel to be given a less controversial name. Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz  is a Cuban communist revolutionary and politician who was Prime Minister of Cuba from 1959 to 1976. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison after rejecting democracy and leading an unsuccessful rising in Cuba. The young Castro was released under amnesty and fled to Mexico where he met the  Argentinean Marxist Ernesto 'Che' Guevara. In 1956, Castro returned to Cuba with Guevara and a small band of insurgents. They launched a bloody and full-scale attack toppling the government led by General Batista and Castro was sworn in as prime minister of Cuba. The introduction of a Marxist-Leninist programme soon followed. Despite his dictatorial style of government and ruthless suppression of opposition, Castro remained popular in Cuba. In 1976, Cuba's National Assembly elected Castro President. Castro stood down as President of Cuba in 2008 - passing the baton to his younger brother Raúl Castro. It also urged Hoyerswerdain be more careful in naming animals in the future. Lötsch said :The cultural body is one of our most import partners and ensures the survival of Hoyerswerda zoo. 'We therefore take its displeasure regarding the name very seriously, even if we cannot entirely understand  it.' Hoyerswerdain zoo in Saxony, Germany, above, agreed to change the name after the intervention of a government cultural funding board . The controversial croc has since been called 'Fidelio', but even that name may not stick long. Experts are yet to ascertain the sex of the animal, which means his now masculine name may have to be switched to something more feminine. Workers have drawn up a contigency plan to call Fidel 'Fidelia' should the young animal turn out to be female.","The young croc was given a name to reference its country of origin .

He's already made a name for himself as the UK's top Michael Bublé tribute act but now Mr England - a.k.a Jordan Williams - is set to make a bid for singing stardom under his own name. The singer, who plans to enter next season's Britain's Got Talent competition, hopes that the festive tune will hit the number one spot - and raise plenty of money for charity in the process. Entitled Here We Are (Merry Christmas), the three-minute track was penned by aspiring songwriter Liam Hopkins, 25, from Warwickshire. Scroll down for video . Festive: Mr England, a.k.a Jordan Williams, is to release a charity Christmas single called Here We Are . Tribute: Before winning Mr England, Jordan (left) made his living as a Michael Bublé tribute act . According to Hopkins, the song, which is available to download on iTunes, was inspired by his mother - who also encouraged him to turn the ditty into a Christmas tune. 'When I gave Jordan a call and sent him the song we received a positive reaction,' explains Hopkins, who spent more than five years searching for the perfect person to sing the track. 'We then met up and recorded the vocals on the hottest day of the year in a converted attic studio in Coventry.' Proceeds from the single will go to Beauty With A Purpose, an organisation that funds poverty-alleviating initiatives around the world, and Harborough Against Bullying, a Midlands-based charity aimed at tackling nastiness to children. 'I recorded the single when we had incredible weather late July so it was strange singing about Christmas but I feel that the UK market has been crying out for a proper Christmas song that tells about the true values and ethos of Christmas,' explains Jordan. Perks: Jordan recently returned from an all-expenses paid trip to Mauritius - accompanied by his mother . Triumph: Jordan had to beat off some tough competition to triumph at the Mr England pageant . Charity: Jordan (pictured with his mother in Mauritius, left) now spends much of his time helping good causes . 'This song, I believe, does that. I'm hoping that we can make it into the top 40 and who knows, with the public behind us, maybe even the number one spot. 'Singing is my life and since winning Mr England, doors have really started to open up for me in the industry. 'I hope that everyone gets behind the record as it's for a good cause and it would be nice to have a real Christmas song on that top spot.' Jordan, 25, from Warwickshire, took home this year's Mr England title after impressing the judges with his Michael Bublé tribute act during the talent round. No stranger to pageants, he came runner-up in the 2011 Mr Coventry competition and triumphed in the Mr Rugby event in 2012.

Jailed: Marcy Cruz waited in the van while Heriberto Viramontes beat Natasha McShane, from Northern Ireland, and Stacy Jurich, both 27, during the Chicago robbery in 2010 . A female getaway driver who helped her boyfriend flee after he unleashed a brutal and unprovoked baseball-bat attack on two foreign exchange students has been jailed for 22 years. Marcy Cruz waited in her van while Heriberto Viramontes beat Natasha McShane, from Northern Ireland, and Stacy Jurich, both 27, during a Chicago robbery in 2010. He was last week found guilty of attempted murder and faces up to 100 years in prison for the attack that left McShane unable to walk or talk after she emerged from a three-week coma. 'I'm sorry,' said Cruz before her sentence was read out. In her testimony, Cruz told the court Viramontes left her in the van after having sex to rob some 'white 'hos'. 'He told me, ""Look at all these white 'ho's,"" that he wanted to rob one of them,' Cruz testified. According to the Chicago Tribune, . the former stripper and mother of two young children also testified . that Viramontes, 34, took a baseball bat from Cruz's van before . disappearing into the early morning darkness. She waited just long enough to listen to one song on the radio while she smoked some marijuana. When Viramonte returned, Cruz told the court that he carried with him two purses and told her to drive off. They divvied up the contents of the purse and Cruz took some Dior perfume and makeup. 'He stated that the girls were really pretty and that he did some bogus (stuff),' Cruz said. Prosecutors . say that 'bogus stuff' was what left McShane disabled for life and her . friend Jurich unable to ever forget what she saw. Cruz . said she'd met Viramontes through her boyfriend, though she admitted to . having had sex with him in the van that tragic April night before the . girls were beaten. Cruz testified that Heriberto Verimontes, left, said he wanted to beat some 'white ho's' and then left the car with a baseball bat. Prosecutors say that's when he brutally beat exchange student Natasha McShane and her friend . Family: Natasha McShane's father Liam, left, sister and brother arrive with other friends and family at the Leighton Criminal Court Building last Thursday . Emotional: The McShane's are in Chicago from Northern Ireland, where Natasha remains because she is unable to walk or talk or care for herself because of the attack . Cruz also . admitted to having falsified parts of the story to the police, but now . says she only did so to try and stay out of trouble. Earlier this year, she pleaded guilty to attempted murder and agreed to testify against Viramontes as part of a plea deal. Cruz was sentenced to 22 years. Last week Jurich sobbed on the . witness stand as she recounted the horrific beating she and Natasha . McShane, a Northern Irish exchange student, suffered in Bucktown in . Chicago three years ago. McShane, . who had been in Chicago for just three months at the time of the . attack, suffered the worst injuries and is now unable to walk or talk . and requires around-the-clock care. Victim: Natasha McShane, 27, is unable to walk or talk after she was brutally beaten with a baseball bat in Chicago in 2010. Her family have decided to keep her in the dark about her alleged attacker's trial . Painful memories: Stacy Jurich, center, leaves the Leighton Criminal Courts Building in Chicago last week after an emotional testimony. McShane's mother Sheila is seen at right . Jurich recalled in court how, after a night of dancing on April 23, 2010, they were walking through a lit viaduct when she was smacked across the back of her head, the Chicago Tribune reported. 'I heard my head being hit and felt . excruciating pain and sort of lost my equilibrium and just had this . taste in my mouth almost like a battery or metallic flavor,' Jurich . testified. Her skull was cracked open and she stumbled to see McShane being hit across the head with a bat. 'She went down immediately,' Jurich said. 'She just . lifelessly fell into the sidewalk.' The attacker then struck her again, she said, and called her a 'stupid b****' as he tore the women's purses from them and fled. Jurich cried as she looked at a photograph of the red jacket she used to try to stop the blood pouring from her friend's head. Scene: The women were walking beneath this viaduct after a night of dancing when they were attacked . 'The blood started coming out of her . head,' she explained. 'I took off my jacket and tried to support her . head as well as I could. Then I got up and ran for help.' McShane's family flew from Silverbridge in County Armagh, Northern Ireland for the trial. They . had previously said they were not going to tell their daughter about . the trial as they did not want to bring back painful memories. Her . mother Sheila testified about her daughter's devastating injuries - and . how she has changed from the vibrant, outgoing student to a woman . combined to a wheelchair and unable to speak. Sheila sometimes referred to her daughter in the past tense as she testified. Support: An image shows a get well soon card for Natasha at a fundraiser after the 2010 beating in Chicago . The jury was shown three videos of . McShane's daily struggles. One showed her struggling to drink from a cup . - using both of her hands and lowering her head to drink. Her parents must cut her food and she . is unable to tell them when she needs the bathroom. She has gained . weight because of her lack of mobility and can only say 'Sinn' - the . Gaelic word for 'we' or 'us'. Jurich . needed 15 staples in her head after the attack but has been able to . return to work. She testified that she is too frightened to drive after . losing her peripheral vision in the beating. Assistant State's Attorney Margaret . Ogarek said there was evidence tying Viramontes to the attack, such as . his fingerprints on McShane's bag which was later found at a gas . station. An alleged accomplice, Marcy . Cruz, 28, claimed that he had spoken about robbing someone that night . and after she parked the car, he jumped out before returning with the . two purses. But Viramontes' lawyer, Assistant Public Defender David Dunne, told jurors the attack was a tragedy but that his client had nothing to do with it. He said that Jurich had first called her attacker a black man but Viramontes is Hispanic. The trial, which continues on Thursday, had been delayed for three years due to legal wrangling over DNA evidence.","Natasha McShane and Stacy Jurich were brutally beaten with a baseball bat in April 2010 as they headed home after a night of dancing .

Two parents were arrested last week after boarding their son's school bus to confront his alleged bullies while threatening to 'kick the kids' a****' Since the beginning of this school year, Christina and Christopher Gring of North Wales, Pennsylvania say their 8-year-old son was the target of bullying. When he came home crying one day, they were only trying to get answers. But the school district says that they were never told about the bullying and that the Grings shouldn't have taken matters into their own hands by getting on the bus - and police agree. Both parents were charged after getting on the bus and yelling obscenities at the children, making some of them cry and others hide under their seats in fear. Taking matters into their own hands: Christina (left) and Christopher Gring (right) were arrested last week after boarding their 8-year-old son's school bus to confront his alleged bullies . Target? The Grings say their son has been picked on by other kids since the beginning of the year but a school investigation found no evidence of bullying . According to the police affidavit, Christina Gring flagged down the bus after it dropped off her son and the driver stopped thinking that her son must have left something on board. But instead, Christina and her husband Christoper got on the bus. While Christoper stood on the steps of the bus, Christina walked to the back of the bus yelling 'Who made my son cry?' The criminal complaint says both Grings yelled obscenities at the children and the bus driver and that Christina even threatened to 'kick the children's a**** if they continued to pick on her son.' Many of the children on the bus were terrified and went home crying. Some hid underneath their seats during the parents' rampage. Before leaving the bus Christopher yelled: 'My kid can beat any of you guys.' After making bail, Christina Gring gave a different account of what happened that afternoon to NBC Philadelphia. Claim of innocence: After making bail, Christina Gring said she was allowed on the bus by the driver who told her to ask the student safety monitors about her son's crying . She says she flagged down the bus and asked the driver why her son was crying and he told her to talk to the student safety monitors. 'I wanted to know what happened' she said. 'When the bus driver told me to ask the kids, why wouldn't I ask them?' Christina insists that she and her husband did not threaten the kids. 'We're not monsters,' she said. 'We didn't mean to scare kids. We love our child just like anybody else loves their child.' She believes that they were arrested as scapegoats for the district and bus driver who failed to confront her child's bullies. 'I think it's because my husband has a record and they needed someone to take the fall for this, because the district wasn't doing what they were supposed to be doing and the bus driver wasn't doing what he was supposed to be doing,' Christina said. All together: It appears that the couple have three children total, according to a family photo posted on Facebook . The school district says that no complaints were filed on the child's behalf. After the bus incident, they conducted an investigation and found 'no reports of bullying'. 'Under no circumstances does NPSD ever want a parent boarding a bus or taking matters into their own hands. But some parents who had children on the bus think that arresting the Grings was overzealous. 'Maybe they went a little overboard with getting on the bus but I don't think they should have been arrested,' Ian Quinn told Fox 29. Howard Henderson's granddaughter Shaniece was on the bus and he's known Christopher for a long time. 'He should have done it in a mature way but I do believe as a parent he was sticking up for his kids. Anybody would stick up for this kids,' Mr Henderson said. Both Grings have been charged with unauthorized school bus entry, making terroristic threats, recklessly endangering another person and disorderly conduct as well as summary harassment. Bail was set at $10,000 each. Christina Gring made bail but Christopher is still in jail. They have a preliminary hearing set for November 5.","Christina and Christopher Gring were arrested last week after getting on their 8-year-old son's bus .

Accident: A car driven by Margaret Lowery, 79, crashed into a vehicle with Darren Handyside, 46, and his two children, Jack, 10, and Sophie, eight . A pensioner made a courtroom apology as she was spared jail for causing a head-on crash that left two young children fighting for their lives. Margaret Lowery - a 79-year-old widow described as a 'community-spirited' member of society - was behind the wheel of a Vauxhall Corsa when it left the road, mounted a grass verge and slammed into an oncoming Rover 25. Darren Handyside, 46, and his two children, Jack, 10, and Sophie, eight, were left with horrific injuries following the smash on September 29 last year on the A688 road near Staindrop, County Durham. Lowery, 79, from Sandford Court, Sunderland, had been driving erratically in the lead-up to the crash and when questioned was unable to explain what had happened. She emerged 'virtually unscathed' and told detectives she had 'felt light-headed' but had no recollection of the crash. During a sentencing hearing at Teesside Crown Court yesterday, prosecutor Adrian Dent said the accident caused 'devastating damage to Mr Handyside’s vehicle' and said it was a 'miracle that nobody was killed'. Mark Savill, defending, told Judge Tony Briggs the case may cause some 'judicial discomfort' given Lowery's age and 50-year unblemished driving record. He said: 'No-one can could fail to be moved and humbled by the accounts of the devastation that the driving that occurred on this day caused. 'All people who hear this case will realise the transient existence that many of us live day-to-day, taking for granted the content, happy and normal lives that most are given but that can change in an instance. 'Mrs Lowery offers a sincere and immediate apology for the affects of this case. 'I don't know how much weight that will carry, certainly with those affected physically in the accident, but it is offered by her, through me, and carries particular weight given her age, her experience of grandmotherhood, her experience of motherhood and the fact she is a thoroughly decent member of society.' Accident: Jack Handyside and his sister Sophie. They suffered head and body injuries and they 'have had an appalling long-term effect' He added: 'This is not a driver who should not have been on the road that day. There's no evidence to suggest that. 'It's rare for an advocate to have the privilege of delivering mitigation of a nature and substance that is present in this case. 'My words can never do justice to the type of individual Mrs Lowery is. There's an element of the surreal that she should be sitting in the dock of a crown court. Repentant: Mr Savill told the court Lowery had surrendered her documents and had no desire to get behind the wheel of a car again . 'She's devoted her life to her family, to hard work in a bank and later as a shopkeeper. She's somebody who puts others before herself and after settling into retirement she's engaged in voluntary work. 'Given her age and given her character she would not hesitate in taking the pain and suffering that Mr Handyside and his children have suffered upon herself.' Suspending a 15-month sentence for two years, Judge Tony Briggs told Lowery: 'This case in my experience is an extremely unusual one. 'I’ve seen many cases where the most appalling piece of driving has caused no injury. 'I see other cases where a momentary lapse in attention has caused the most catastrophic consequences.' He added: 'The tragedy of this case is the catastrophic injuries caused to Mr Handyside and his two young children. 'The three suffered head and body injuries and they have had an appalling long-term effect.' Widowed grandmother Lowery, a former bank worker and shop assistant, entered a guilty plea to dangerous driving. Mr Savill told the court Lowery, a WI member who had held an unblemished driving licence for 50 years, had surrendered her documents and had no desire to get behind the wheel of a car again. Lowery had her driving licence disqualified for life.","Margaret Lowry veered off the road and into path of oncoming car .

British families are the biggest web shoppers in the world with almost £1 in every £5 spent through computers, tablets and smartphones. Some 18.3 per cent of all retail spending – which does not include food food – is made via the internet, according to new figures from the British Retail Consortium. This is the highest figure on record and believed to be considerably higher than the rest of Europe and even the USA. Big spenders: Figures show British families are the biggest web shoppers in the world with almost £1 in every £5 spent through computers, tablets and smartphones . A separate study suggests Britons will spend £20.4billion on the web in the nine weeks before Christmas with £10billion in December alone. The switch to shopping online is having a profound effect on high streets with the result that tens of thousands of bricks and mortar stores have no future. Many famous names, from Comet to Clintons cards, have disappeared while other major chains have called a halt to the building of large new stores. The shift has triggered a major rethink about the future of town centres, with government planning ministers signalling that derelict shopping streets must be turned over to housing. The BRC said total retail sales in . October were up by 2.6 per cent on the same month last year, however . there were falls on both food and clothing. It . picked out the internet as being the star performer, saying: ‘Online . sales of non-food products in the UK grew 12.1 per cent in October . versus a year earlier. Changes: The switch to shopping online is having a profound effect on high streets with many famous names, including Comet, disappearing . ‘The online penetration rate was 18.3 per cent in October, the highest level ever recorded by our monitor over 23 months.’ The IMRG, which is the trade body for web stores, predicts Christmas web sales will be up by 15 per cent on a year ago, boosted by the use of smartphones and tablets. Spokesman Tina Spooner said: ‘Already we are seeing a number of retailers ramping up their online offering in the run up to Christmas. ‘Click & Collect, next day delivery and even one-hour delivery slots are just a few of the options on offer to attract the lucrative festive shopper at this highly competitive time of year.’ Big sellers in October included stand-alone mixers, which were made popular by the BBC’s Great British Bake Off series, tablets such as the new iPad Air, televisions, fridges and washing machines. Computer games also sold well following the launch of the British success story, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Fifa 14. Popular: Big sellers in October included stand-alone mixers, which were made popular by the BBC's Great British Bake Off series . A number of celebrity books, including Sir Alex Ferguson’s autobiography, had strong sales, giving a boost to a market that had been in the doldrums. High street sales of fashion and shoes suffered in October because the warmer than usual weather hit demand for the autumn ranges, however this was partially off-set by increased online sales. Dresses, shoes and engagement rings are among the most searched for items among consumers on the web, alongside computer games, the iPad and the xBox games console. Big read: A number of celebrity books, including Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography, had strong sales, giving a boost to a market that had been in the doldrums . A recent EU study found 82 per cent of Britons regularly shop online, which is the highest of the 28 member states. Denmark and Sweden came in second at 79 per cent, ahead of Germany on 77 per cent, Luxembourg on 73 per cent and Finland at 72 per cent. At the other end of the scale were Italy and Estonia, at just 29 per cent, and Romania at just 11 per cent. The research found internet users in the UK lead for online purchases of clothes and food, while Sweden is number one on travel and Luxembourg for books. Internet shopping is also stronger in the UK than the USA because web purchases of food and groceries has not taken off on the other side of the Atlantic to the same extent. Some 21 per cent of families here shop online for food and groceries, compared to less than 10per cent in Europe and the rest of the world. Head of Retail at KPMG, David McCorquodale, predicted retailers will have to battle hard to win sales ahead of Christmas amid a continuing cost of living squeeze. ‘Shoppers seem reluctant to buy their gifts early and at full price and many may be delaying their purchases in the hope that retailers will discount festive goods as the big day nears,’ he said. ‘The pressure is on retailers to kick start sales, without the need to heavily discount.  Christmas has always been retailers’ golden goose and a good performance in the next two months will help those in the red move back to the black.’","Some 18.3% of all retail spending is made via the internet .

The coffee shop's birds are tethered to plastic and wire trays and can be petted and held by customers. It has attracted much local media attention, and popular website Rocket News 24 paid them a visit and reported back on what they found. Reporters said the shopfront windows had their curtains closed, so no outside light can filter in - and no pedestrians can stop to look either. Owl enthusiasts queued outside to wait for a time slot to pet the birds and drink coffee. The café doesn’t have a booking system so customers must come on the day hope there will be an opening. The birds are tethered to plastic trays to be seen, petted, and held . 'Once you’re let inside the cafe, the first thing they have you do is settle into a seat and choose a drink,' writes Preston Phro. 'The menu is pretty simple: You can choose from iced, hot, or alcoholic drinks like coffee, tea, and beer. 'Since there’s no cover charge, you have to buy at least one drink – which will cost you 1,000 yen [£6.30] for non-alcoholic drinks or 1,200 [£7.50] yen for alcoholic drinks. While this might seem expensive, it also gets you one hour with the owls.' Phro explains that the café has strict rules governing contact with the birds. 'It’s nothing too extreme, but some of the owls can’t be held and others cannot be touched at all. 'Also, while photos are completely fine, you’re not allow to use your flash or take videos. 'Finally, when holding an owl, or, rather, when an owl is perched on you, you have to hold the tether tightly.' The shopfront windows were covered with curtains, so no outside light can get in . The café has strict rules customers must read before they are allowed near the owls . He goes on to say that though the birds are quite mellow, if they get spooked or irritated, they’ll try to fly away. So by hanging onto the tether, you can prevent them from smacking into a wall or getting attacked by another owl. Furthermore, customers are warned that there might be issues with owl droppings. With the introduction finished, writers were allowed to handle the owls. 'When petting the owls, there are two things you have to careful of. The first is to pet softly, from front to back. You need to go with the feathers; going against the feathers can hurt the birds,' writes Phro. 'The other thing is just being aware that they might try to nibble your hand. This is how they communicate, so unless it really hurts, just continue petting. If you start and stop too much, it will annoy the owls. The Japanese capital of Tokyo has opened its first ever owl cafe in the Tsukishima region . RSPCA warns wild animals and have specialist needs which are hard to cater for in a captive environment . Customers can take photos, but they're not allow to use flash or take videos . Some of the owls were off-limits to customers for various . reasons. One was born blind, so couldn’t be petted for fear of . surprising him, and there were two owls that were just too . tired. MailOnline contacted the RSPCA for their opinion on the owls' welfare. They responded with the following comment. 'We would have serious concerns for the welfare of wild animals kept in captivity in this way in the UK,' said senior RSPCA wildlife scientist Dr Ros Clubb. 'Owls . are beautiful animals which appeal to many people but they do not make . good pets and are not suitable to be used in this way. They are wild . animals and have specialist needs which are hard to cater for in a . captive environment. 'Owls . are by nature generally shy and reclusive birds, preferring to spend . most of their time roosting in a secluded place, and most species are . nocturnal. They also have sharp talons and strong feet that can inflict . deep puncture wounds and scratches. 'Owls need very large aviary with a sheltered roosting area and a specialist diet. 'The conditions shown in the pictures are totally unsuitable.'

Tom Watson has been placed at the centre of Labour’s vote-rigging row in Falkirk after one of the candidates for the seat directly accused him of trying to fix the selection. Gregor Poynton, a Blairite communications expert, said Ed Miliband’s former campaigns chief had used his power in the party to try  to install his union-backed office assistant as the candidate. Mr Poynton also claimed that Mr Watson had been involved in ‘all the shenanigans’, including trying to pack the Falkirk party with members of the Unite union to win selection for his assistant, Karie Murphy. Blairite Gregor Poynton, left, has accused Ed Miliband ally Tom Watson, right, of being key to the vote-rigging scandal in Falkirk, Scotland. Police investigated in May amid claims the party was packed with Unite members . He also alleged that the party leadership ‘knew what was going on’. It is the first time Mr Watson, who stepped down from his frontbench role in the wake of the row, has been publicly accused by another party figure of trying to influence the selection process. Mr Watson did not respond to messages but has previously denied any wrongdoing or involvement in the alleged ‘fix’ of the selection process in Falkirk. The explosive claims come just days before the contest to succeed Eric Joyce, who quit the party after a Commons bar brawl, is reopened in the Scottish seat. Labour suspended the selection in May after The Mail on Sunday revealed it was investigating allegations of vote-rigging by Unite and had referred the matter to the police. Mr Poynton claimed Mr Watson had been involved with trying to pack the Falkirk party with Unite members to win selection for his assistant Karie Murphy, left. The row has caused headaches for Ed Miliband, right . Ms Murphy and the local party chairman, Stephen Deans, were also suspended - triggering a knock-on threat of industrial action by Unite at the nearby Grangemouth petrochemical plant, where Mr Deans is a union convener. Mr Miliband dropped the investigation in September after key witnesses withdrew their testimony. Mr Poynton, the UK political director of communications firm Blue State Digital, made his remarks at a party fundraising dinner last week. Mr Poynter is married to West Dunbartonshire MP Gemma Doyle, pictured . He described an atmosphere of ‘serious intimidation’ during the selection process - claiming he and fellow candidates had ‘all been taken out in one way or another’. He told how Mr Watson had tried  to help Ms Murphy by ‘packing’ the local party with Unite members, ‘getting them put on the membership list... they had a spreadsheet of names and a cheque, and he phoned up party office and said you need to accept this’. He described the reaction of Labour HQ as ‘it’s a bit dodgy... not sure about this’, adding about Mr Watson: ‘He was involved in it all behind the scenes... all the shenanigans, pushing things through’. But Mr Poynton said that when the party leadership uncovered the allegations it tried to broker a deal with Unite for Ms Murphy to quietly stand down: ‘The party came to a deal... we’re not going to investigate this stuff that’s gone on, we know what’s all gone on, but you have to pull out of the selection,’ adding: ‘Their preference was, we know it’s all happened but it’s better for everyone if you just pull out.’ Shortly before the process was suspended, Mr Poynton was eliminated from contention when an all-female shortlist was imposed. Mr Poynton, who is married to West Dunbartonshire Labour MP Gemma Doyle, said he still had not ruled out being selected when the process is reopened. The allegations follow the leak of emails last week which appeared to show Unite officials were involved in a bid to undermine Labour’s inquiry. Unite dismissed the suggestion and said neither the law nor party rules had been broken in the selection process. Last night, a senior party source said: ‘We have acted swiftly and decisively throughout the process, and the candidate at the centre of the issue has now withdrawn.’ Mr Poynton did not comment.","Gregor Poynton, a candidate for the seat, has laid blame with Miliband ally .

Under fire Toronto mayor Rob Ford has finally admitted that he smoked crack 'probably a year ago' when he was in a 'drunken stupor.' Ford's admission to reporters on Tuesday follows six months of accusations during which the embattled mayor has repeatedly refused to step down. The allegations that he had been caught on video smoking crack surfaced in May. 'Yes, I have smoked crack cocaine,' Ford told reporters on Tuesday outside his office. Scroll down for video . Six months after the allegations first surfaced, Toronto mayor Rob Ford admitted to reporters on Tuesday that he had smoked crack 'probably a year ago' At a second press conference Ford made no mention of resigning or entering rehab and instead he said the people of Toronto would get to decide on his future at the ballot box . After the allegations about the crack smoking video first surfaced in May, Ford initially insisted the video didn't exist and sidestepped questions about whether he had ever smoked crack. He was forced to backtrack after police said last week that they had obtained a copy of the video, which has not been released publicly. 'Yes, I have smoked crack cocaine,' Ford told reporters outside his office. 'There have been times when I've been in a drunken stupor. That's why I want to see the tape. I want everyone in the city to see this tape. I don't even recall there being a tape or video. I want to see the state that I was in.' Ford walked out of his office and asked reporters to ask him the question they first asked him in May. He acknowledged he smoked it but said: 'Am I an addict? No. Have I tried it, probably in one of my drunken stupors a year ago.' Earlier on Tuesday, Ford's brother, Doug, left, criticized Police Chief Bill Blair for saying he was 'disappointed' in the mayor . On Tuesday afternoon Ford gave a more formal press conference in which he appeared close to tears as he said that making the admission was the hardest thing he had ever done. He then went on to say that he loved his job and he wanted to return to doing the job that he was elected to do, which he said was 'saving taxpayers money.' Ford made no mention of either resigning or entering rehab as a result of his admission, but instead said that the people of Toronto would have the opportunity in October 2014 - and the next mayoral election - to decide at the ballot box if they wanted him to continue. 'I was elected to do a job and that's exactly what I'm going to continue doing,' Ford said. 'On Oct. 27 of 2014, I want the people of this great city to decide whether they want Rob Ford to be their mayor.' Ford had previously apologized for excessive drinking and other mistakes but has rebuffed pressure to step down. He had sidestepped questions about whether he has ever smoked crack until now. Despite his admission, Ford against insisted he would not resign. Municipal law makes no provision for the mayor's forced removal from office unless he's convicted and jailed for a criminal offense. City Councilor Denzil Minnan-Wong, a member of Ford's executive committee, said he would put forward a motion asking Ford to take a leave of absence. 'My first reaction was ""Wow"",' Minnan-Wong said. Councilor Jaye Robinson said the mayor needs to step aside and address his problems. 'We have become a laughing stock of North America, if not the world,' Robinson said. Scandal: A still image allegedly taken from the video that purportedly shows Ford smoking crack . Ford later told the Toronto Sun newspaper that he is not stepping down or taking a leave of absence. 'I feel like I got 1,000 pounds off my back,' Ford told the paper, which is sympathetic to the mayor. 'I felt like I had to say it. It is what it is. I feel two inches high right now but I needed to deal with it. I am not going to quit or take a leave.' Earlier on Tuesday, Ford's brother, Doug, criticized Police Chief Bill Blair for saying he was 'disappointed' in the mayor. Doug Ford called the chief's comments 'inappropriate' and 'biased' and said Blair should step aside. 'We have the most political police chief we have ever seen,' said Doug Ford, a Toronto City Councillor. 'The police chief believes he's the judge, the jury and the executioner.' Blair says he responded honestly when asked about his feelings after watching the video. Another city councilor, John Filion, called Doug Ford's attack against the police chief 'appalling' and said the Ford brothers have 'crossed the line with not only the alleged behavior, the lack of comment on the behavior, and now attacking the people brought some of that behavior to light.'

The lover of a serial con artist who posed as a 'well-heeled' stockbroker has apologised to his latest victim after being jailed for helping him pull of the scam. Gail Heyworth, 51, lived a life of luxury thanks to the lies of Scott Travis despite claiming she was also one of his victims. However, she was found to be the person collecting cash from one of his victims when another woman came forward after being duped out of nearly £12,000 by Travis. Con artists: Scott Travis, left, and Gail Heyworth, right, plotted to fool a Muslim woman looking for love into handing over almost £12,000 in cash . Sorry: Heyworth, pictured here before her sentencing, met the victim several times, posing as a family friend to collect the money . The 45-year-old fraudster, who lived . with Heyworth in a council flat in Heywood, Rochdale, posed as a . 'well-heeled bachelor' on SingleMuslim.com called Mohammed Kashif Rai who was looking for a bride. He met a 25-year-old woman online and reeled her in with lies about extensive financial interests and property portfolio before concocting a sob story to ask for cash. Heyworth then met the victim several times, posing as a family friend to collect the money. Now she has joined Travis behind bars after a judge said she must have known what the 'pathological liar' was really like. Form: The court heard how conman Scott Travis has a history of fraudulent activity . Travis is already serving eight years in jail after posing as an Italian aristocrat to dupe an 82-year-old man out of £100,000. Outside court before she was jailed, Heyworth . said: 'I would just like to apologise to her. If I get any money in the . future, I would give her some. I hope he would do the same. He tells me . his family has money and, if that's the case, he should give her some.' She . claimed Travis, who lived with her in their council flat for 18 years, was . 'manipulative' and she no longer wanted him in her life. But it is the . third time she has made the claim after being involved in his string of . scams. In 2004, Heyworth . claimed she was left £15,000 in debt by unemployed Travis, after telling . her he was an Italian viscount called Franco Dibella III. She . later claimed he had wormed his way back into her life and, when Travis . was jailed last year for fleecing the elderly man, she claimed she felt . ‘sickened'. Manchester's . Minshull Street Crown Court heard she helped her lover commit his . latest lonely-hearts fraud between July and November 2011. The pair, of . Middleton, near Rochdale, both pleaded guilty to one count of fraud. Lisa . Boocock, prosecuting, said Travis told the lonely-hearts victim he was . called Mohammed Kashif Rai when he met her on the Muslim Singles . website. Fraud: Travis posed as a 'well-heeled bachelor' on the Single Muslim dating website to reel in his victim . Reality: Scott Ravis and Gail Heyworth were actually living together in this council flat in Heywood, Rochdale . He claimed he owned . property in Hale Barns and Pakistan, but later claimed he had become . the victim of fraudsters and needed money to pay for car insurance and . religious clothing. Travis . asked the victim to drop off some of the cash at his council flat, but . claimed he could not be there because he was suffering from cancer. He also arranged for the victim to hand money to Heyworth at two meetings at the Trafford Centre and in Cheetham Hill. Apology: Gail Heyworth helped Travis dupe a Muslim . woman out of nearly £12,000 . Other money was deposited in a bank account before the victim became suspicious and contacted the police. Miss Boocock said: 'The victim felt that they would marry. Everything he said was very convincing.' The victim said in a statement read out in court: 'He has betrayed me and broken my heart. He's ruined my confidence.' Travis did not appear in the dock. He had refused to leave his cell at the jail in Wolverhampton, where he is being held. Patrick . Buckley, defending Travis, said he had refused to engage with his . solicitors. Shirlie Duckworth, defending Heyworth, said the extent to . which she was taken in by him was ‘very hard to quantify'. The . court heard a psychiatric report on Heyworth found no evidence of . mental illness, but she had previously suffered from stress. Judge . Mushtaq Khokhar jailed Heyworth for eight months. He also jailed Travis . for 18 months, which will be added on to the eight-year sentence he is . already serving. He said the victim was a vulnerable woman who had been . humiliated. He said: 'He is a pathologically-born liar in every sense of the word. Even when he was caught, he persisted in that.' Sentencing . Heyworth, he added: 'It may be that he told her lies, but she lived . with him a number of years and she would have known what he was like. 'There is no way of her being manipulated like she says. She accepts that she knew this money was being obtained.'","Scott Travis, 45, made victim think he .

The thieves, who climbed over their garden wall and smashed through their patio door, got away with some cash, a camera, an iPod and two gold watches. Mr Owens, who runs a PR business, said they decided to put up the passive-aggressive note rather than ‘sit around and mope’. The letter apologises for not ‘having particularly expensive tastes’ and says Mr Owens was disappointed they chose to ignore Ms Barrett’s ‘awful’ VHS video and cassette collection.

In a new development on the case of a 16-year-old boy charged with beating his mother to death, the dramatic 911 phone call the boy's stepfather placed to police has been released, with the man not knowing at the time his wife was already dead. The stepfather, who has not been identified, is trying to compose himself while talking to the operator, after fleeing the scene when his stepson repeatedly attacked him with a frying pan. The stepson, Michael Roy Helms, 16, is standing trial as an adult on murder charges after the body of his mother, Tina Helms Spencer, was found beaten to death at her home in Mesa, Arizona. Her body was found in a shed behind the house. The 911 call reveals the stepfather arrived at the house at about 4am on October 26 - the morning after the murder - and was almost immediately attacked by Helms, according to AZ Central. 'I grabbed the frying pan to defend myself. He came at me like crazy,' the stepfather said. 'He said, ''You can die and go to hell'', and started raising the frying pan at me over and over.' Scroll down for recording . Michael Roy Helms, left, is said to have bludgeoned his mother to death because she grounded him while his friend Christian Blakely, right, watched and helped him move the body. A new 911 recording released this week reveals how Helms stepfather, fleeing from the scene of the crime after being attacked by Helms, worried for the welfare of his wife, who was already dead . The stepfather mentioned more than once during the recording that he asked Michael Helms about Tina Helms Spencer. 'He said he doesn’t know where she’s at,' the stepfather said at one point during the recording. 'She’s supposed to be getting home from work right now. I don’t know where my wife is.' Detectives believe Helms, along with friend Christian Lee Blakely, 17, waited at the family’s house just south of U.S 60 and east of Gilbert Road until Helms Spencer arrived. The stepfather said he thought she was asleep in the couple’s master bedroom and that she should be with their two dogs. 'I don’t know where my wife is,' he again told the dispatcher. 'He keeps saying she’s not home.' The stepfather continued describing the attack in detail to help at least three officers who had responded to his house. He also described how one of his eyes was swollen shut and he was having difficulty breathing because he has asthma and had been jumped by his stepson. Mike Helms is facing first degree murder charges after the body of his mom, Tina Helms Spencer, 36, was found at the family's home in Mesa, Arizona, on Saturday . Helms has been booked into juvenile detention on charges including first-degree murder, aggravated assault and tampering with evidence . Little did the stepfather know, Helms had allegedly already killed his wife Tina, police allege. Sgt. Tony Landato, a Mesa police spokesman, said the stepfather’s phone call gave police a good idea of what they would face when they arrived at the house. 'He did exactly the right thing. He got himself to safety and he called us,' Landato said. When the stepfather returned to the house, 'he was coherent enough to help us with our investigation,' providing important details about the missing vehicle and other information that would help police track down Michael Helms, Landato said. Helms was arrested later that afternoon, when he drove up to the co-defendant’s house in his slain mother’s vehicle, Landato said. Court documents say that Helms confirmed many details but added that Blakely helped him drag Helms Spencer’s body to the shed. Joan . and Phil Knowles, who moved to the neighborhood almost two years ago . said they knew something was up on Friday when they spoke to Helms. 'He said the house is now . mine — three times,' Phil Knowles told AZCentral. 'I really thought of . him as being aloof, not aggressive,' Phil said. Joan said Helms 'told us his folks moved to Ohio to be closer to . family'. They also said he bragged in the past about owning a boa constrictor which he fed a chicken to every week. Michael . Helms was arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder, attempted . first-degree murder, three counts of aggravated assault with a dangerous . instrument, concealment of a dead body and tampering with evidence, . according to the court document. Blakely was arrested on suspicion of first-degree homicide accomplice, concealing a dead body and tampering with evidence.

A school friend of Helms described him as a friendly kid, a junior ROTC cadet in high school. 'He's a giant teddy. He's tough on the outside. He puts up that front, but when you get to know him, he's a standup guy,' Mike O'Connor told FOX10. 'He didn't really have home issues he talked about. If he did, it was typical stuff.

Ulrika Jonsson has spoken out after Sven Goran Eriksson confirmed their affair in his autobiography . Making love with Sven-Goran Eriksson was as dull as putting together Ikea flat-pack furniture, TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson claimed yesterday. Miss Jonsson, 46, said the former England manager was: ‘Devoid of passion. He had all this power and money yet he was the weakest man I have ever met. ‘Sex with Sven was as ordered and functional as an Ikea instruction manual. Putting together a Billy bookcase would have probably left me more satisfied.’ Miss Jonsson said her fellow Swede loved to ‘talk dirty’ in broken English when they were in bed together. ‘It was strange, she said. ‘He didn’t speak English well at all so we always spoke Swedish to each other. 'But when we were in the bedroom he always talked dirty in this singy-songy broken English. I tried to ignore it. ‘It would have been better if he hadn’t spoken at all. I had to do all the work and the sex was always over very quickly.’ Miss Jonsson said Eriksson lived in fear of his ‘feisty fruitcake’ girlfriend Nancy Dell’olio who slapped him when their four-month secret affair was exposed. But she claimed the Italian should be grateful for the scandal because it made her famous. Speaking in response to Mr Eriksson’s tell-all book, serialised in the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, Miss Jonsson said: ‘From what he told me, Nancy was handy with her fists. 'There was one time after our relationship became public that he had a cut on his nose and he told people he had tripped on some stairs. ‘I asked him on the phone if he was OK when Nancy found out and he replied: “Well I’m still alive.” She was aggressive with him and he told me that many times.’ Miss Jonsson said Eriksson, 65, and Miss Dell’Olio, 52, were not suited. She said in an interview with The Sun: ‘Sven studied philosophy, he is a calm and logical man. She is a fiesty fruitcake. 'She was with him for money and he was with her because he was scared of what she’d do if he wasn’t. Mr . Goran Eriksson said that that his then girlfriend Nancy Dell'Olio . regarded Miss Jonsson as 'little more than a prostitute' in an extract . from his book serialised by the Daily Mail this week . ‘When I asked him why he didn’t leave her he said it would cost him too much. But I could tell it was more that he was scared of her.’ Miss Jonsson’s affair with Eriksson  began in January 2002 a month after they first met at a party. She said: ‘I never took a penny from Sven during our time together — I even insisted on buying my own plane ticket when we went to Portugal together. Yet Nancy has accepted money from Sven throughout their entire relationship. ‘She should be thanking me. Before news of our affair broke she was just the Italian girlfriend of Sven. Mr Goran Eriksson and Miss Dell'Olio stayed together after the revelations but separated in 2006 . ‘When it hit the headlines, Nancy was suddenly famous. And she used that to her advantage. She’d have never been on Strictly Come Dancing if it wasn’t for me.’ Eriksson acknowledged his affair with Miss Jonsson for the first time in our excerpts from his autobiography. He revealed that it started when they met for the second time at a function in Manchester. He wrote: ‘I was there with some people from the FA. For some reason, Ulrika was also invited. We met at the hotel the evening before and ended up spending the night together. ‘After that, Ulrika and I met when we could. Not daily, but now and then. It got to be more and more serious. ‘Nancy did not suspect anything. She was travelling to Italy a lot during that time. Once, Ulrika and I went to Portugal for a few days. Mostly we met at her house outside London.’ He said Miss Dell’Olio was livid when she found out about the secret relationship when it was revealed by a Sunday newspaper. ‘To Nancy, Ulrika was little more than a prostitute who was not worthy of being on the same planet as Miss Dell’Olio,’ he wrote. ‘Nancy’s mother called from Italy. She had read the story online — Italy was an hour ahead of England. ‘Nancy was livid, she said: “Was it true?” I said it was nothing to worry or get upset about, or something to that effect.’ Mr Eriksson, now a football coach in China, said he did not feel he had anything to apologise for and claimed he received a positive reaction from the public. ‘I got a lot of “thumbs up” from young men who laughed and said they wished it had been them getting together with a beautiful woman like Ulrika.'","Miss Jonsson said that putting up bookcase would be more satisfying .

He confessed the shooting to police, but claimed that he killed her because he was tired of suffering abuse at her hands. He is expected to claim self-defense.

New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez tested positive for a banned substance in 2006, sources linked to baseball's drug tests have revealed. But the damning results were never disclosed because a Major League player must fail two drug tests before his name is released. The 38-year-old's legal team has denied the claims and has accused senior baseball officials of leaking the evidence because they are 'desperate' to win the drug arbitration case against the athlete, The New York Times reported. The revelations have also raised concerns about the credibility of past statements the player has made about his connection with performance-enhancing drugs. Confidential: New York Yankees' star Alex Rodriguez tested positive for a banned substance in 2006, but his name was not released because of Major League drug test regulations . The third baseman is in the middle of a heated legal battle to overturn the 211-game . ban handed down by MLB in August to him and 13 other players. He was given the suspension after violating doping regulations in the league's collective bargaining . agreement and is the only player challenging the decision. The uncovering of the failed drugs test will not lead to any further sanctions by the league, because players are only banned after their second substance offence, but his legal team claim it will damage his reputation even further. James McCarroll, a lawyer for the . three-time AL MVP, did not address whether Rodriguez had a positive . test, only that he was not banned as a result. He said: 'Alex Rodriguez was never suspended for use of stimulants or any violation of the MLB drug program. 'The . fact that MLB has resorted to leaking federally protected medical . information about a player speaks volumes of the weakness of their case . against Alex - and their desperation to secure a win in the arbitration, . at all costs. Anthony Bosch, former boss of South Florida anti-aging clinic Biogenesis, is the star witness in the MLB case against Rodriguez. It has been alleged Biogenesis supplied baseball superstars with banned substances . In a . statement, Larry Davis a former Clinton administration . official working for Rodriguez's legal team, called for a government . probe into MLB's methods. The league has admitted paying for documents and . Rodriguez's lawyers have claimed baseball's representatives have . intimidated witnesses. 'U.S. authorities should initiate an investigation as to whether any federal . crimes have been committed by MLB investigators as well as those in the . Commissioner's office who may have been complicit in this misconduct.' His legal representatives also claim that the player has abided by the confidentiality laws set out in the drugs agreement, while the league have gone against it. When he arrived at spring training in 2008, Rodriguez said: 'Last year, I got tested 9 to 10 times. ... We have a very, very strict policy, and I think the game is making tremendous strides.' The new revelation comes just three weeks after it was revealed the player paid . $305,000 to buy evidence and hide potentially incriminating links to . Biogenesis, the Florida clinic behind baseball's doping scandal. As . the proceeding to end the dispute between Major League Baseball and . Rodriguez reached its halfway point, it was revealed A-Rod . handed over cash for documents that included videotapes and affidavits . that could incriminate him or be used in defense against doping allegations, the New York Daily News reported. Rodriguez is the only player contesting the ban and is allowed to play for the Yankees during his appeal. A . source with knowledge of the closed-door proceedings, held in MLB's New . York Park Avenue offices, told the Daily News that A-Rod and his . representatives confirmed during sworn testimony that Rodriguez forked . over the $305,000 to buy the evidence from Biogenesis - a claim that . boosts MLB's case against the fallen star. But . with MLB seemingly set to strike out Rodriguez, A-Rod's team hit back . with a counter claim that the league also paid cash to Biogenesis for . its own evidence in the case. The New York Post . claims its own source revealed that MLB Chief Operating Officer Rob . Manfred testified on Thursday that he authorized a payment of $125,000 . in cash in return for documents from the Florida clinic. But A-Rod's legal team denied the allegation the 38-year-old third baseman paid any money to acquire data from the disgraced anti-aging clinic. 'The notion that we paid any money for any Biogenesis documents is patently false, and anyone who is leaking this information knows it’s false,' said A-Rod attorney Joseph Tacopina. But a third source told the Post the tit-for-tat claims over cash payments was all about the detail. Rodriguez apparently did acquire copies of Biogenesis information but did not pay for it, a point that shows just how much the he-said she-said desperate details of the proceeding have turned ugly. Alex Rodriguez strikes out against the Tampa Bay Rays at Yankee Stadium in September. His 211-game ban is not in effect while he appeals the decision. A-Rod's career could be on the line as the MLB doping dispute gets ugly and uglier . A Post source claimed Manfred's testimony stated a member of MLB's investigation team made one payment of $100,000 and a second payment of $25,000 to Gary Jones, a former Biogenesis employee, for information stolen from Biogenesis founder Tony Bosch. After receiving his 211-game ban based on connections to Biogenesis, Rodriguez sued MLB and included in his filing that: 'Dan Mullin of MLB purchased what were represented to be these stolen documents for $150,000 in cash, which was handed off in a bag at a Fort Lauderdale, Florida area restaurant.' MLB denied those allegations and said: 'None of those allegations is relevant to the real issue: whether Mr. Rodriguez violated the Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program.' Major League Baseball COO Rob Manfred said that if the league did buy evidence from third parties it was to reveal the illegal activities of players . Manfred said MLB buying evidence was legal. 'There is nothing wrong with purchasing documents in an investigation,' he told the Daily News. 'We did it in the course of trying to see if we had players using performance-enhancing drugs in violation of our agreement. I’ve acknowledged it previously.' Arbiter Frederic Horowitz is expected to rule in December whether Rodriguez’s suspension by MLB will be hit out of the park or stand firm. If confirmed, the ban will be the longest in MLB history. A-Rod's career - and legacy - depend on the decision.","Third baseman's legal team have accused league of leaking the evidence .

'I realized that if I didn't lose weight, I was going to end up like my dad,' Juan Luis told Vice. 'We had to try hard to get the surgery, though – I was underage at the time, so government-run hospitals wouldn't admit me.' The pair first started getting fat when they were three because 'there was a lot of eating.' 'I started getting worried, so I took them swimming, to soccer practice, Taekwondo, anything,' said their mother, Juana, 51, said.

'Every year they went to school, I had their trousers custom-made. 'I didn't realize they were a size 38 when they were six, or 40 when they were ten. And I didn't know how to reverse it when I did realize.' In 2009, Juan Luis had a gastric sleeve applied in the Rubén Leñero General Hospital in Mexico City, reducing the size of his stomach between 60 and 85 percent. Following the surgery he lost an astonishing 230 pounds. New person: Pedro's transformation has allowed him to embrace his love of football.

But, just as astonishingly, his body began to rebel, and the capacity of his stomach fought through the procedure and readjusted itself, causing him to put the weight back on. In 2010, Pedro underwent his own surgical operation to combat obesity. He had a balloon inserted into his stomach which, once inside, is expanded so there's less room for food. He had waited for three years for the surgery. Afterwards he fell ill due to complications, contracting pneumonia and other infections, some caused by antibiotics. After 73 days in hospital, he recovered. In 2012, Juan Luis went underwent a gastric bypass surgery in the same hospital. The procedure was far more serious, dividing the stomach in two, with the bigger half then enclosed by the intestine. It is irreversible. Jump forward to today and Pedro weighs 160 pounds.

The party company that made the Duchess of Cambridge's parents multi-millionaires has paid thousands to charity after they were sanctioned for breaching environmental rules, it emerged today. Party Pieces handed £12,650 to the Woodland Trust for apparently failing 'to ensure packaging is recycled in the UK'. In Britain companies with sales of more than £2million must comply with Britain's Packaging Waste Regulations, but it appears the Middletons did not not realise. Breach: Carole and Michael Middleton, pictured last month at Prince George's christening, have made millions from Party Pieces, which has now made a substantial donation to charity after a recycling rule breach . Success: Party Pieces sells party items and fancy dress around the world online but was first run by Mrs Middleton from the family's kitchen table in 1987 . Rather than be taken to court by the Environment Agency, and fined, the company instead opted to make a charitable donation. The Woodland Trust has strong links with the royal family, having asked Britain to 'come together' to plant six million new trees for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in 2012. 'Party . Pieces appears to have broken environmental laws aimed to ensure . packaging is recycled in the UK,' Steve Eminton, editor of letsrecycle.com told the Daily Telegraph. 'Rather than facing a court appearance . and a potential fine, the business has taken advantage of an option . given to it by the Environment Agency of making a donation to charity. 'I would hope that Michael and Carole recycle more in the future . and adopt a greener approach to their business activities.' The Telegraph claims that Party Pieces has now joined Paperpak, a package recycling scheme, which would have saved them thousands had they done so earlier. A spokesman for the company said: 'In 2012 it came to our attention that . due to a misunderstanding we were breaching one of the guidelines. Party Pieces corrected this error immediately and is now fully compliant . with the Packaging Waste Regulations.' Despite the success of Party Pieces, The Middletons have been accused of cashing in on their royal connections. When Kate was pregnant their website offered miniature castles, ‘prince’ and ‘princess’ banners and balloons are among the other royal baby-themed products. The website, set up by Carole Middleton in 1987 also offered paraphernalia themed around the Royal Wedding and the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. Magic Moment: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with their young son, but the Middleton's business has been accused of cashing in on this relationship . Its street party items included state carriage-shaped cardboard teapot vases, coat of arms cups printed with ‘Long Live G&T’ and canape flags featuring crown-wearing corgis. The company – which Mrs Middleton started from scratch by making party bags around her kitchen table – also had a dispute with Britain’s Got Talent after using the show’s logo on the site without permission and on another occasion fell foul of strict advertising laws covering the London Olympics. It also rowed with Bond film producers Eon Productions after using the logo for the latest James Bond film, Skyfall. Although accounts for the company are not publicly available, it is clearly a success for the Middletons, who recently bought a £4.7million country home and put their three children through private school.","Party Pieces handed £12,650 to Woodland Trust after environmental blunder .

Damaging: Oliver Robbins, the deputy national security adviser, said articles based on confidential files leaked by US fugitive Edward Snowden, pictured, exposed the capabilities of the intelligence and security agencies . Newspaper stories based on stolen top secret documents have caused ‘real and serious damage’ to Britain’s national security, a senior official warned yesterday. Oliver Robbins, the deputy national security adviser, said articles based on confidential files leaked by US fugitive Edward Snowden exposed the capabilities of the intelligence and security agencies. As a result, they risked helping terrorists evade detection and endangering the lives of British service personnel. His stark warning came at the start of a judicial review into the use of counter-terrorism powers to detain and question David Miranda, the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, by the police and Security Service earlier this year. Mr Miranda was stopped at Heathrow Airport on August 18 and found to be carrying 58,000 documents, part of the cache stolen by Mr Snowden from the US National Security Agency. He was held for nine hours. He later revealed he had no idea what he was carrying for Mr Greenwald, prompting descriptions of him as a ‘document mule’. Matthew Ryder QC, for Mr Miranda, told the High Court yesterday that the use of the Terrorism Act 2000 to seize the materials was a ‘disproportionate interference with his right to freedom of expression’. The Home Office argues that MI5 had a duty to stop him and seize the documents to protect national security.

Thirteen-year-old Devalon Armstrong has pleaded guilty to negligent homicide, after killing his five-year-old sister with wrestling moves he had seen on television. Viloude Louis died from the brutal beating on June 16 in Terrytown, New Orleans. Armstrong had originally been charged . with manslaughter, but took a plea deal at the trial in Jefferson Parish . Juvenile Court on Tuesday in return for the less serious charge. It means he will spend up to five years in a juvenile detention centre and may be free by the time he turns 18. Tragic: Viloude Louis died from a brutal beating meted out to her by her step-brother, who has pleaded guilty to a charge of negligent homicide . If he’d been found guilty of manslaughter, he would have been jailed until he was 21. The . ruling came after Armstrong hand-wrote a statement in court, Judge . Andrea Janzen having deemed his interview with detectives after the . death as inadmissible, because neither he nor his mother, who attended, . would have understood the legal obligations of what was happening. He . wrote the statement with shackled hands as his mother, 39-year-old Haitian immigrant Allourdes Desvallons, sobbed nearby and . his step-father, Viloude’s father Vilger, looked on with a blank expression, . The New Orleans Advocate reported. In . the statement Armstrong admitted playing with Viloude ‘in a bad way’ and hitting her on the back and stomach 15 to 20 times, the paper said. He also admitted using ‘body slams’ that he’d seen wrestlers John Cena and Mark Henry perform. The little girl had suffered broken ribs, internal bleeding and a lacerated liver. The . teenager, who is also known as Armstrong Desvallons, told officers . after his arrest that their mother was out of the house when the incident took place. Paramedics found the girl unresponsive and she was pronounced dead a short time later. Scene: The little girl suffered the beating in this Louisiana neighborhood while her half-brother babysat her . Armstrong was arrested after a coroner investigation found the girl died of multiple injuries, two days after the death. Devalon . told investigators the girl had a stomach ache and went upstairs to . brush her teeth, and 30 minutes later he found her on the floor . complaining her stomach still hurt, Jefferson Parish Sheriff's spokesman . Col. John Fortunato said. The . teenager claimed he took the girl downstairs to the sofa and called 911 . when he saw she was no longer breathing. Dispatchers told him to start . CPR and paramedics arrived on the scene. The . coroner's office said there did not appear to be any outward signs of . injury and her death was left as unclassified, but then Devalon told . detectives he had been practicing World Wrestling Entertainment-style . moves on the girl, The Times-Picayune reported earlier this year. Hearing: The trial took place at Jefferson Juvenile Court . He . said that even when his little half sister said she was in pain, he . continued to carry out the moves on her. Detectives added that he . appeared to be enjoying talking about the assault. The Sheriff's office reclassified her death as a homicide and Devalon was arrested on suspicion of second-degree murder. Speaking after Tuesday's trial, Mrs Desvallons told The New Orleans Advocate that she forgave her son. She said: 'God asks us to forgive. Yes, I forgive him.' Janzen will now consider his sentence. Violent: The boy said he used moves on his sister like those he had seen on World Wrestling Entertainment .","Devalon Armstrong, 13, admitted using body slams he'd seen TV wrestlers John Cena and Mark Henry use .

A victim of an online 'rape club' that allegedly preyed on underage girls was told by police that 'she was asking for it' by wearing a skirt, it has been claimed. Earlier this week police in New Zealand said two teenage boys, who called themselves the 'Roast Busters' and embarked on a campaign of luring girls into drunken group sex before boasting about their 'exploits' on Facebook, will not be charged. Auckland police said the boys, aged 17 and 18, would not be prosecuted because no apparent victims - some as young as 13 - had been 'brave' enough to testify. 'The Roast Busters': Police said the boys, aged 17 and 18, will not be prosecuted because no apparent victims - some as young as 13 - have yet been 'brave' enough to testify . But one girl, who is now 15, has . said she made a rape allegation to police two years ago and was made to reenact the alleged rape during a taped interview in front of officers. She . says she told police that she had been raped by three boys from the . Roast Busters gang but they focused on why she wore a skirt when . she met members of the group in 2011. 'They . said that I didn't have enough evidence to show, because I went out in . clothes that was pretty much asking for it,' said the girl, who was aged . 13 at the time. Police Minister Anne Tolley said the case, which has sparked outrage in New Zealand, had been 'poorly handled' and she had asked the police watchdog to conduct an inquiry. 'I . believe this is the right course of action to ensure the public has . confidence in the police on this matter,' she said after calling in . Police Commissioner Peter Marshall for a briefing today. New Zealand Prime Minister John Key described the case as 'abhorrent' Tolley said the police treatment of the girl would be part of the Independent Police Conduct Authority inquiry. 'Parents of young girls need to have confidence that complaints to police about sexual assault are investigated thoroughly and appropriately,' she said. When . the story broke Prime Minister John Key called the group's alleged . actions 'abhorrent' but said it was difficult for authorities to . prosecute them due to a lack of hard evidence. Police . at the time said they had been aware of the group for two years but . took no action because none of its alleged victims was willing to . testify against them. But it . has since emerged that four girls complained to police as far back as . 2011, including one who made the formal statement featuring video . testimony about what she allegedly endured. Key . told parliament on Thursday that the performance of police was . 'frankly, not good enough' and he was disappointed ministers had learned . details of the case through the media, despite requesting a full . briefing. But he said a more . important issue was that the allegations were properly followed up by . police and the complainants, who were emotionally vulnerable and a . potential suicide risk, were given adequate support. 'These . are fragile young girls that could potentially take their own lives,' he said. 'We already know that one of them has considered that.' Victims' rights advocates such as Greens MP and former sexual abuse counsellor . Jan Logie have said that if the claims made by Roast Busters members are . true then it amounts to a 'rape club' and they should be charged accordingly. 'Grow up!' Their actions have sparked anger across Twitter . Police . Superintendent Bill Searle said officers were reviewing evidence and . hoping to speak to victims again to see if a prosecution was possible. 'We will look at the whole evidence, at the time, to make a proper assessment,' he told Radio New Zealand. Searle said investigators were aware 'very early on' that one of the alleged gang members was the son of a police officer but the fact had no bearing on how the case was handled. Detectives also confirmed that one of the boys is the son of a high-profile entertainer with 'an international profile'. The boys used the social networking account to post text and videos to recruit others to join their sex campaign. 'A true roast is where you know you are going there intentionally to roast this female,' says one in a video. 'We . don't choose a roast, the roast chooses us. We have girls hitting us up . to ""hang out with us"". They know what we're like; they know what . they're in for.' A young man goes on: 'We take what we do seriously - some of you think this is a joke, it's not. 'You try and get with the amount of girls we do. This is hard, it's a job, we don't do this s*** for pleasure.' Speaking to New Zealand's 3 News on the condition of anonymity, one alleged victim described her ordeal. 'I . just kept blacking out 'cause i had drunken too much,' she said. 'You . could say I got raped. I had sex with three guys at one time.' Anger: Others criticised the police for letting the boys get away with their lurid sex campaign . A witness who claimed her sister was raped at one of the boys' parties told Radio Live: 'I could name, like, literally 30 girls from all around Auckland. I went to one of the boys' houses one day whose parents were away on holiday. And they had this room there which they called the layer. 'They would take girls inside the layer. There was blood all over the walls and they would take three different girls in there at a time.' Rape Prevention Education said the behaviour described on the Facebook page is rape. 'It is not only morally reprehensible, it is criminal and illegal behaviour,' the group said. The support group said the use of alcohol by offenders is often premeditated and planned. However, police say they cannot prosecute until one of the girls comes forward. Detective Inspector Bruce Scott said: 'None of the girls have been brave enough to make formal statements to us so we can take it to a prosecution stage or even consider a prosecution stage.' He added: 'The page was left open for operational and tactical reasons, and whilst we acknowledge it was upsetting for the victims, it was being monitored for information or evidence that would assist our investigation.' He said the The Facebook page alone does not provide evidence which would allow the case to be put before a court. Their actions also provoked anger on Twitter. One tweeter wrote: '#roastbusters grow up, get checked and have some dignity. Little boys trying to play big games.' Another added: 'Their stupidity p****s meeh off! Yes, of course you'll be known, BUT for all the wrong reasons! #RoastBusters . 'K here I am raging bout them lil fem%en$, forgetting I have two exams too! Grrrr ... #NoSleepTonight.' A message from someone linked to the group said he made some 'major mistakes' in a message posted on Twitter, adding that he had made 'some dramatic changes' to himself since appearing on the news. He added: 'I have not been happy with who I have become and if I suffer any consequences from my past actions then I guess I deserve it but I just want people to know I am a good person at heart and I have matured and have taken this as a massive learning experience.' He went on to say that he hoped no one else would go down a similar path. 'All the girls that have been affected by this whole ridiculousness I apologise and wish the best for you.' But other Twitter users were quick to call into question the sincerity of the apology. Pound Cake posted: 'They've been doing it for 3 years and that's all he could come up with? #OhWell #Karma.'","New Zealand police said boys would not be prosecuted because no apparent victims came forward .

A rarely-seen Neapolitan collection of sumptuous jewellery estimated to be more valuable than England's crown jewels has opened in Rome. Hidden away for centuries, the Treasure of San Gennaro is formed of precious objects donated in tribute to the patron saint of Naples. It has rarely left the southern Italian city and spent centuries locked in a vault, largely forgotten by the wider world. Scroll down for video . Sumptuous: Visitors look at the Necklace of St Januarius, made in 1679 by goldsmith Michele Dato, on display as part of the treasure exhibition in Rome . Impressive: A golden mitre commissioned to crown the saint's bust in its annual procession is made of 3,300 diamonds and hundreds of rubies and emeralds, given in many separate donations . In awe: Visitors looks at the mitre, part of a collection on display at the Fondazione Roma Museum in Italy . Pretty: Chalices at the unprecedented exhibition of emeralds and diamonds once owned by popes and kings . The 70 pieces were transported under heavily armed guard to a central Rome museum earlier this month and will be on display until February. Known in English as Januarius, the bishop of Naples was martyred in the 3rd century and remains popular among Catholics. Thousands gather three times a year to see whether a vial of his coagulated blood will turn to liquid, which they believe to be a miracle bringing good fortune to the city. Some Neapolitans attribute a 1980 earthquake that killed thousands to the failure of the dried blood to liquefy but sceptics say the liquefaction could be brought about by shaking or heat from hands holding the vial. Close-up: A detail of a chalice displayed during the press day of the new exhibition at the museum in Rome . Story: The exhibit, which runs until February, features the empty reliquary that holds the saint's purported blood.

'This necklace tells the history of Europe' Paolo Jorio, expert at Naples museum . The vow was put in writing by a lawyer, and the original 1527 document is on display at the exhibition entrance in the Fondazione Roma-Museo. The hoard includes what is thought to be one of the most precious pieces of jewellery in the world - the necklace of San Gennaro, begun in 1679 to adorn a gold and silver bust containing the skull of the saint. Separate ornate pieces of jewellery were forged together over centuries to make the necklace. Walking on by: A man steps in front of a tapestry at the exhibition.

A young doe horrifically shot through the head with an arrow is still alive and searching for food in a New Jersey garden. The doe was photographed again on Wednesday by Susan Darrah as it foraged in her Boonton garden. She said the young animal appeared with several other deer after she left out corn and pears on the advice of the Fish and Wildlife Division. Still alive: A young deer that has an arrow wedged near its jaw was spotted in a New Jersey garden on Wednesday . Injured: The arrow head can be seen sticking out of the deer on the left . Wildlife officials are planning to tranquilize the deer so the arrow can be removed, according to NJ.com. Despite Ms Darrah spotting the injured animal several times since it first appeared in her garden on Friday, no one in the wildlife department has encountered it. Larry Ragonese, a spokesman for the department, said staff are looking for the deer and contacts in the hunting community have been asked to search for it too. Until it has been caught Ms Darrah says she is 'on deer watch'. Its latest appearance on Wednesday was at about 4.30pm. It was with several other deer and the animals remained in Ms Darrah's garden until it got dark. She first alerted authorities to the animal's plight after photographing it in her garden. She said she was shocked to see it had a dart wedged near its jaw. 'Shocked': Susan Darrah said she took this photo of a deer impaled by an arrow in her New Jersey back yard .

But there was one accolade that she was not happy to receive - a place in FHM's 'Sexiest Women in the World' list. The 21-year-old snubbed the 'awards ceremony', saying it was a 'no go' area for her and she wanted to focus on her athletic career rather than strip off for lads' mags. Double Olympic winner Laura Trott says the realm of lads' mags are a no-go for her and finds it unappealing . Refreshingly, the Olympic record holder has refused to compromise her principles by conforming to pressures for women to look a certain way. The successful cyclist made it clear that the world of sexualised photoshoots did not appeal to her and she did not want to make lads mags part of her image. Her decision is a stark contrast to her . fellow London Olympic teammates, who have posed for magazines in racy . underwear and appeared naked for billboard adverts. Victoria Pendleton appeared in FHM in 2009, and is a one of many Team GB stars to have stripped off . Rower-turned-cyclist Rebecca Romero was photographed naked for an advertising campaign . Victoria Pendleton was ranked 39 in the Sexiest Women list .

Trott, who is in a relationship with her Olympic teammate Jason Kenny, avoided criticising her fellow cyclists, saying that it was her choice not to raise her profile through suggestive photos shoots. It is not just the female athletes who have stripped off to raise their profiles. Half of Team GB have taken part in suggestive shoots.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 21:03 EST, 10 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:05 EST, 10 November 2013 . Researchers in Japan believe that the fear of the dentist may be triggered by the grating sound of dental drills and the scraping of pointy instruments as oppose to the pain of surgery. According to data reported at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego on Sunday, measuring the way the brain reacts to certain sounds may help doctors treat patients with anxiety. Pediatric dentist, Hirokuyi Karibe, worked with psychiatrists to test they way sound triggers parts of the brain--especially those linked to stress and dental visits. People who have anxiety associated with going to the dentist experience certain sounds in a different part of the brain than people who are not afraid . A recent UK population survey of oral health indicated that around 10 per cent of the population have extreme anxiety associated with going to the dentist. A large percentage of the population put off dental visits entirely unless absolutely necessary such as in the case of an abscess or painful toothache.This fear presents serious health problems for patients who could've been treated sooner. The Guardian reports that Karibe found that subjects who were frightened by going to the dentist showed marked differences in the brain's neural activity in response to sound. 'Do you feel anxious when you hear the dental drill?' was one of the questions Karibe asked 21 women and men aged 13 to 19 in a survey measuring the relationship between sound and anxiety. Researchers scanned participants in a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine (fMRI) like the one shown here, while playing a series of dental sounds . 'As a pediatric dentist, I've seen many patients since 1987, and from my clinical experience, I found that the sound of drilling can evoke anxiety in dental patients,'Karibe told The Guardian. This is the first study ever conducted that measures how the sounds of dental instruments relate to brain activity. 'Do you get tense during dental treatment?' was another question he asked the participants in his study. The volunteers answered 20 questions on a scale from one to five with one being 'not at all' and five being 'very much.' Based on survey scores, Karibe separated participants into high fear and low fear groups. Patients who showed no fear of the dentist processed sound in a part of the brain associated with auditory functions while the fearful group processed sound in a part of the brain associated with learning . He then scanned his participants in a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine (fMRI) while playing a series of sounds of wrenching dental drills and thirsty suction cups. He also played neutral sounds. 'All of the participants were isolated in the fMRI room when they listened to the dental sounds, so we couldn't see if they responded visibly or audibly to the dental sounds, but we could recognize their responses from their brain activity,' said Karibe. The low fear group showed little to no signs of anxiety about going to the dentist. Their brain activity showed that when listening to dental sounds, the part of the brain called the left and right superior gyri (one of the primary auditory areas of the brain) was triggered more than when hearing neutral sounds. The high fear group showed some interestingly different results. When more anxious people listened to sounds it triggered a response in the left caudate nucleus (the part of the brain that may play a role in learning). 'We believe the findings can be applied . to assess the effectiveness of interventions such as cognitive behavior . therapy for patients who have a strong fear of dental treatment,' Karibe . said. Martin Tickle found that anxiety actually may cause the pain dental patients fear . Fear of the dentist is an inherited trait, according to Martin Tickle, a professor of health at Manchester University. Kids whose parents are afraid of the dentist are more likely to be afraid themselves. But a survey by Tickle indicates that pain during dental surgery is very rare. He compiled data from 451 adult patients visiting the dentist and found that 75 per cent of patients reported no pain whatsoever. Patients who had serious dental surgeries such as tooth extraction and root canal traetments had higher pain scores, but some said they still felt no pain. Anxiety may actually be more a cause of pain than the procedure. 'The strongest predictor of pain during dental procedures was dental anxiety. Anxious patients were four times more likely to experience pain than non-anxious patients after controlling for other factors,' Tickle said. Tickle believes that more must be done to prevent tooth decay among children than quell dental anxiety. 'I don’t think the answer for the NHS lies with giving dentally anxious patients brain scans. The first thing we need to do is prevent dental caries in young children to stop them having to have extractions, as the most common reason why children have a general anesthetic is to have decayed teeth extracted,' he said. 'We also need to improve the amount and quality of research looking at how to effectively manage children and adults who are dentally anxious and provide guidelines for dentists on how to use research-proven interventions,' he said' As for anxiety, Tickle thinks talk therapy and counseling may help patients lessen their stress and therefore lessen pain.","Researcher Hirokuyi Karibe found that patients who were afraid of the dentist register dental tool sounds in a different part of the brain to those who were not anxious .

Gun violence in popular movies has tripled since the 1980s, according to a new study, which suggests films that were once rated R at the time of their release would be rated PG-13 today. Films released today, such as The Hunger Games and The Avengers, contain more violence than the R-rated films of the 1980s, according to the report published Monday in the journal, Pediatrics. Overall, violence in movies has nearly quadrupled since the 1950s. Box office hit: The Hunger Games, starring Jennifer Lawrence, is one of the movies released today that 'contains more violence' than R rated films from the 80s . Psychologists say it’s a worrisome trend that we should take seriously, because there is evidence that watching violence on screen increases aggression in real life, according to NBC News. ‘Of course it’s not the only factor, and it may not even be the most important factor, but it isn’t a trivial factor — and it’s one we can change,’ says Brad Bushman, an Ohio State University psychologist and lead author of the new report. The study was done on 945 of the top-grossing films released from 1950 to 2012. Researchers found that since 2009, PG-13 movies have featured as much or more violence than the R-rated films released those same years. Researchers: Brad Bushman, left, and Dan Romer, right, say the worrisome find in their study, published in the journal, Pediatrics, is something that can be changed. They say gun violence in films affects people's behaviour . And in 2012, there was more gun violence in PG-13 films than in the R-rated ones out that year. The study looks at the Bruce Willis Die Hard sequels, such as the 1990’s Die Hard 2, which was rated R. But the 2007 Live Free or Die Hard, which had more gun violence and a comparable amount of overall violence, was rated PG-13. A similar find was discovered with the Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator movies, which shows Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines had an R rating in 2003, but it had less gun violence than 2009’s Terminator Salvation, which received a PG-13 rating. Once hardcore: Die Hard 2, starring Bruce Willis, was rated R when it was released in 1990 . Not so hardcore? The third installment of the Die Hard series, the 2007 Live Free Or Die Hard, also starring Willis, was rated PG-13, even though it contains more gun violence then the sequel . 'I am the Terminator': Terminator 3, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, was rated R when it was released in 2003. It had less gun violence than the next film in the series, 2009's Terminator Salvation, which got a PG-13 rating . The study’s co-author, Dan Romer, . director of the Adolescent Communication Institute at the University of . Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center, said the famously violent . 1987 film The Untouchables has gun violence ‘comparable to a lot of the . movies we’re calling PG-13 in the last five years’. ‘I wouldn’t be surprised if The Untouchables today would get a PG-13,’ he tells NBC. Romer thinks the same would apply to the Eddie Murphy comedy Beverly Hills Cop, which was rated R in 1984, but feels more like today’s PG-13 movies in terms of violence. Movie ratings are determined by the Motion Picture Association of America. 'Famously violent': Sean Connery and Kevin Costner, in the R rated 1987 film, The Untouchables, which researchers say would receive a PG-13 rating if released today . Child's play: Eddie Murphy in the comedy Beverly Hills Cop, which was rated R in 1984, but feels more like today's PG-13 movies in terms of violence . Sex worse than violence? Mark Wahlberg in bed with Mila Kunis in a scene from the 2012 movie Ted, which was rated R because of a sex scene . The researchers also examined the . content of graphic sexual scenes in the movies and found that sex was . much more likely to earn a film an R-rating than violence would, such as . the comedy film Ted, starring Mark Wahlberg. ‘(Sex) consistently gets an R rating if it’s at all explicit, but that’s not the case with violence,’ Romer says.

David Cameron has taken personal charge of trying to avert an A&E winter crisis. The Prime Minister has ordered live updates on waiting times and treatments to ensure the NHS can cope with a surge in demand as temperatures fall. It follows warnings that the number of patients waiting up to 12 hours on trolleys has almost doubled in two years, with Labour seize on the figures to claim the health service is struggling to cope. Charge: David Cameron has asked for live updates on waiting times in the NHS . Downing Street has ordered unprecedented levels of planning for the winter, including £500million for the most stretched A&E departments to cope over the next two years. Dr Cliff Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, warned last week: ‘All the worrying indicators are up already. And they seem to indicate that this winter will probably be worse than last winter, which was the worst we have ever had. It’s a tipping point for the NHS’s delivery of acute care. ‘It’s not chaos in emergency departments, but it is a crisis.’ The latest figures from NHS England, the body in charge of the health service, show there were 87,186 trolley waits of between four and 12 hours from April to October 2013. This figure is up from 47,644 for the same period in 2011. And the numbers having to wait up to four hours in A&E - the Government’s target time - has increased by 43 per cent in two years. However, the government insists that targets for 95 per cent of people to be seen within four hours is still being met, and the average waiting time in A&E is now 50 minutes, compared to 70 minutes under Labour. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has sought to blame GPs for not seeing patients out of hours, forcing many more to go to casualty departments. Mr Cameron is now ‘working very closely’ with Mr Hunt with ‘a particularly focus around A&E’, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said. ‘A&E departments can come under particular pressures during the winter period. He does want to and continues to be updated on the very latest available NHS performance statistics, including the A&E statistics.' Warning: Accident and emergency units across the country are at 'tipping point', senior doctors have warned . The spokesman added: ‘We know that A&E has seen 1.2million more people compared to three years ago, a significant increase. ‘Over the recent period the NHS A&E departments have been meeting the 95 per cent performance measure. ‘The Prime Minister has already announced across the next two years £500million of extra resources, particularly targeted at those trusts with the A&E departments that may face the greatest pressure.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband has accused Mr Cameron of being ‘clueless’ about the winter crisis facing the NHS. Mr Miliband claimed the NHS ‘isn’t safe’ in Mr Cameron’s hands, and blamed the government’s reorganisation for diverting health funding to pay for six-figure pay-offs for managers.","Prime Minister demands updates on pressures in the NHS .

A dressmaker made famous by the TV show Big Fat Gypsy Weddings has been accused of treating one of her staff 'like an animal', and almost attacking her head designer after a shouting match. Thelma Madine, 61, who makes dresses which have featured on the hit Channel 4 show series exploring the raucous marriage ceremonies of Britain's travelling community, was accused of mistreating her staff today during an employment tribunal. Pauline Wooley, whose daughter Leanne Phillips, 31, was head designer at Nico Bridal Company until she was dismissed after the incident last year, gave evidence suggesting Ms Madine routinely mistreated her staff. Tribunal: Thelma Madine, 61, (left) is being sued for . unfair dismissal and £1,200 in wages by former employee Leanne Phillips, . 31, (right) after she was fired last Christmas . Collaborators: Ms Phillips, left, and Ms Madine, right, posing with a dress made of hair . Ms Wooley, who is currently suspended from her role as Assistant Manager at the company, told the court hearing in Liverpool that she was 'treated like a dog' by her employer, who had also been a close friend for more than 20 years. She claimed that she had to physically restrain Ms Madine after she advanced angrily on her daughter after she intervened in an argument by calling Ms Madine a 'horrible b****'. The dispute, on 18 October last year, led to Miss Phillips being dismissed from her job. She is now pursuing her former employer for unfair dismissal and £1,200 of outstanding wages. Ms Wooley, who says she has been suspended from her job for nine weeks without pay, told the tribunal: 'Thelma treated me like an animal. She intimidated me and she bullied me. Leanne was just defending her mother. 'Thelma started the whole argument - she had treated me really badly. She was screaming so loud her face went red and her veins were sticking out of her neck. 'Thelma advanced aggressively at Leanne, and I had to pull Thelma away. The way she reacted was disgusting.' The court also heard that Miss Phillips had known her employer from the age of four and said she saw Ms Madine 'as like an aunt'. Ms Madine shot to fame after her dressmaking . business Nico was featured on Channel 4's My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding for . making elaborate wedding gowns for the travelling community . Ms Madine was said to have treated her like a member of the family - even giving her a lavish sports car for her 30th birthday. Ms Wooley said: 'Leanne thought the world of Thelma, and Thelma treated her like a daughter.' However, Peter Maratos, an employment expert speaking on behalf of Ms Madine, said that Miss Phillips was 'spoiled' and 'over-reacted' after the publicity from featuring on the TV programme had 'gone to her head'. 'Like family': The tribunal heard how Miss Phillips, pictured at court earlier this week, looked up to Ms Madine and thought of her like an aunt . Ms Madine was also accused of botching a disciplinary process launched after Miss Phillips tried to appeal her sacking. The court heard that she sought legal advice from her company lawyer Neil Gouldson, who then led the investigation, which accused her of encouraging her mother to act insubordinately, bullying co-workers, and making racist comments. Miss Phillips' solicitor, Steve Pinder, said: 'Ms Madine made a number of very serious errors. Her approach to the whole disciplinary process was flawed. Ms Madine made it clear that she would not have taken Miss Phillips back, even after the appeal.' Mr Maratos defended the set-up, saying: 'In this case family relationships had deteriorated. Thelma's position had been undermined - the position was untenable. 'However Ms Madine handled the process, it would have still resulted in a dismissal. The investigation gave the respondent reasonable belief of misconduct.' Judge Vincent Ryan reserved judgement on the case at the request of Mr Maratos, and an outcome is expected to be delivered by the end of the month. He said: 'It is extremely sad when relationships of over 20 years come to this. 'No one will be happy with the argument - it is sad.' The court case comes one year after Ms Madine published her autobiography, Tales of The Gypsy . Dressmaker, in which she praised Miss Phillips. She . wrote: 'Leanne is now the head designer at Nico and is starting to . oversee parts of the process that I had to do, which is great, because . it means that I can concentrate on other parts of the business.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 09:52 EST, 11 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:36 EST, 11 October 2013 . Dramatic accounts of the Navy SEALs rescuing the captain of an American cargo ship made headlines around the world in 2009. The military said SEAL snipers killed a trio of pirates in a tense standoff. Three shots, three kills. It was the lethal, coordinated precision that has made SEALs famous and feared. Captain Richard Phillips: Dramatic accounts of the Navy SEALs rescuing the captain of an American cargo ship made headlines around the world in 2009 . Recounting his story: President Barack Obama meets with Richard Phillips, captain of the U.S. cargo ship Maersk Alabama that was hijacked by pirates off the Sudanese coast, and his wife Andrea in the Oval Office of the White House . It was an unbelievable story, with a new retelling that hits the big screen Friday with Tom Hanks playing Capt. Richard Phillips. But the official version that unfolded in the Indian Ocean wasn't as tidy as Hollywood's, or the versions in Phillips' own book or in contemporaneous news reports. In fact, many more than three shots were fired, $30,000 went missing and the integrity of the SEALs was questioned. The unvarnished story begins on April 8, 2009. Four armed Somali pirates scurried up the side of a large cargo ship, Maersk Alabama, and took the crew, including Phillips, hostage. Rescued: Captain Richard Phillips stands alongside Cmdr. Frank Castellano, commanding officer of USS Bainbridge after being rescued by U.S. Naval Forces April 12, 2009 off the coast of Somalia . Captive: Phillips was held hostage by suspected Somali pirates in the lifeboat for five days after a failed hijacking attempt off the Somali coast. Three of the pirates were killed and one captured in the firefight that freed Philips . In a failed attempt to get the pirates to leave, Phillips gave them $30,000 from the ship safe. The pirates eventually abandoned the Maersk, jumping into a lifeboat and taking the cash and Phillips at gunpoint. The USS Bainbridge, a destroyer that had responded to the hijacking, gave chase as the pirates headed toward the Somali coast. Days later, a team of SEALs parachuted into the Indian Ocean and boarded the Bainbridge. During the crisis, the Navy persuaded the pirates to let the Bainbridge tow the lifeboat and then tricked the fourth pirate into coming aboard the Bainbridge. As the Bainbridge reeled in the lifeboat for a better shot, the SEALs took up positions on the back of the warship and trained their sights on the three pirates. On April 12, the SEALs acted. After a gun unexpectedly went off inside the lifeboat, the SEAL snipers opened fire. Seconds later, a SEAL, possibly two of them, descended the tow rope and onto the lifeboat. He quickly shot the pirates -- one of whom was still alive. Former SEAL Matt Bissonnette recounted the episode in his memoir 'No Easy Day.' Bissonnette was deployed aboard the adjacent USS Boxer, an amphibious assault ship, when the rescue took place. 'Entering the life raft, they quickly and methodically re-engaged each pirate, making sure there was no more threat,' Bissonnette recalls. 'They found Phillips tied up in the corner unhurt.' Open water: In a still frame from April 2009, video released by the U.S. Navy taken by the Scan Eagle unmanned aerial vehicle, a 28-foot lifeboat from the U.S.-flagged container ship Maersk Alabama is seen in the Indian Ocean . Hijacker: Abduhl Wali-i-Musi was the sole survivor of a group of four pirates who attacked the MV Maersk Alabama and held the captain for ransom at gunpoint. On 16 February 2011, he was sentenced to over 33 years in federal prison . In an interview, Phillips said he didn't know if the SEALs fired inside the lifeboat. But after it appeared the shooting had stopped, he said, one of the pirates closest to him was 'gasping' and in a 'death rattle.' The young pirate had two serious chest wounds, he said. He didn't see the other two pirates at the other end of the lifeboat. Attorney Philip L. Weinstein, who represented the surviving pirate later prosecuted in federal court, said his legal team had an expert examine photographs the government provided of the dead Somalis. The expert estimated about 19 rounds had been fired into the bodies, Weinstein said. 'There were clearly not three shots fired,' Weinstein said. 'They were riddled with bullets.' Under the Geneva Conventions, an enemy combatant who has been injured so severely that he no longer can fight is supposed to be protected and medically treated even as he is taken into custody. Scott L. Silliman, a professor at Duke University Law School and an expert on wartime legal doctrine, said he believes the SEALs did nothing wrong. He said the SEALs had to make the assumption that the Somalis were armed and a continuing threat. In other words, they were still combatants. 'I think it is pretty clear under the military's rules of engagement that if the SEAL believed he still faced a threat against him he was authorized to use lethal force,' he said. 'I think it was an appropriate use of force under these circumstances.' ¿Captain Phillips¿ Stars Tom Hanks as a High-Seas Hostage . The $30,000 was never recovered. As part of the investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, SEALs were polygraphed, according to former and current law enforcement and military officials who spoke under the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to talk about the case. It's not clear if all the SEALs who responded to the hijacking were polygraphed. Nobody was exempt from questioning. Investigators interviewed Capt. Frank J. Michael, who was the executive officer of the Boxer and among of the highest-ranking Navy personnel to enter the lifeboat after Phillips had been saved, a former U.S. official said. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Courtney L. Hillson declined to discuss SEAL tactics or specifics of the case but said: 'The case was ultimately closed without evidence of wrongdoing.' Weinstein said his client, who pleaded guilty and was sentenced to nearly 34 years, had no idea who took the money, and he didn't think the pirates threw it overboard. Weinstein said there were plenty of people who had access to the lifeboat after the shooting stopped. He said the crime scene was 'contaminated.' According to Phillips' account of the kidnapping, the money could have easily been concealed in a small bag or someone's pockets. In his book, Phillips writes that while he was held hostage on the lifeboat, a pirate took the money out of the bag and began dividing up into piles. There were 'two stacks of hundreds, one of fifties, then twenties, fives, and tens ... I never saw the money again. Later, when they gave me a sack to lean against, I felt the stacks of money inside, but I never spotted the cash out in the open again.' Reconstruction: Tom Hanks in a scene from the film, 'Captain Phillips,' To the Somalis, the ship apparently looked like a floating jackpot . Kevin Speers, a spokesman for Maersk Line Ltd., said the missing money remains a mystery: 'We simply don't know.' In the new film 'Captain Phillips,' viewers shouldn't look to the movie for the complete story. It doesn't depict the aftermath inside the lifeboat or the criminal investigation that followed. Director Paul Greengrass said the movie wasn't intended to tackle every twist and turn but hews to the truth. Greengrass said he was aware of the shooting that took place inside the lifeboat and grappled with how much bloodshed to depict. In the end, he made narrative judgments. The final violence wasn't necessary. The result was the same: Phillips was saved and the pirates were killed. What happened to the money didn't concern him. 'Movies are not journalism,' Greengrass said. 'Movies are not history.'","The Naval Criminal Investigative Service opened an investigation into missing cash .

Three animal shelter workers have been put on paid leave as investigators determine why an adopted puppy was euthanized on the day it was due to go to its new home. German Shepherd JoJo, one, was waiting for his new owners to arrive when Hillsborough County Animal Services staff mistakenly put him down on October 8. The workers were initially relieved of duties . relating to euthanasias, but managers decided on Thursday to place them on leave. Fatal error: JoJo the German Shepherd was put down as he waited for his new owners to collect him . Tampa Bay Times reported the three employees were Sue Padgett, an animal care supervisor with 26 years in the department, and senior animal care assistants Debra Parker and Bradley Hansen. Parker worked at the shelter for two years, while Hansen had been there for about one year. Shelter director Ian Hallett would not comment on whether the workers would be re-instated. 'The administrative leave is simply procedural while the investigation is ongoing, and there have been no disciplinary determinations made,' Hallett told Tampa Bay Times. Hallett . previously apologized for the 'regrettable' death, blaming human error. He said the family had visited the shelter to adopt a puppy, but fell in . love with JoJo. After the dog was accidentally put down Hallett . contacted them personally. 'Sadly, JoJo had been selected for . adoption and was to be picked up by his new family later that day ... a . combination of human errors may have been the cause of JoJo’s . euthanization,' he said. 'It looks like the file was not cleared . for euthanasia but the procedure was done.' Apology: Shelter director Ian Hallett says the staff responsible have been placed on paid leave . However, this was not the first time Hillsborough County Animal Services had made a fatal error. It has been alleged there were about four mistaken killings over the summer period. In April last year a mixed dog named Zeus, who had been adopted, was accidentally euthanized only an hour after arriving at the shelter. The shelter has also been criticized over illness at the center, including a recent outbreak of Parvovirus, a contagious and potentially fatal dog disease, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Mistake: JoJo is not the first adopted dog to have been accidentally euthanized . Hallett was brought in as director last year to implement changes at the shelter and try to reduce its high kill rate. About 12,000 animals a year are euthanized at the center. Since taking over he has extended the center's opening hours to allow more potential adopters to visit the animals being held there. However, he has been under repeated criticism for problems with managing the spread of disease and poor communication of shelter goals and procedures, according to Tampa Bay Times. Dogma Pet Rescue owner Amy Howland says the workers are 'overworked and stressed'. She said it was inevitable workers made mistakes when they were tired.","Three Hillsborough County Animal Services staff on paid leave after puppy killed on day he was going to a new home .

A sequin-clad Sarah Palin today dismissed suggestions that Chris Christie could turn around the Republican party as she refused to throw her support behind him. The former Alaska governor told the Today show she was glad the New Jersey governor won at the polls last week - but fell short of embracing him as a potential GOP presidential candidate in 2016. 'I would never put my hope and faith . in any one individual,' she said, dodging the question of whether she supported him. 'There is no Ronald Regan on the scene today.' Scroll down for video . Eye-catching: Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin appeared on the Today show on Monday, wearing a glitzy shirt and bejeweled belt, to talk about Obamacare, Chris Christie and her new book . Christie had an easy victory at the . polls last week - scoring votes from women and Hispanics in a sign he is . appealing to voters other Republicans have historically been unable to . touch. Of the win, Palin added: 'Right on! Beats the alternative.' She has previously attacked Christie for his famously outspoken style. 'Some people look at him as, ""Ah man, he's a governor who goes rogue"",' she previously told Fox. 'No, . he's got a schtick going there where he's got a YouTube videographer . following him around, kind of these set-up situations sometimes so he . can be seen as perhaps a little bit avant-garde and going rogue on . things.' Palin had also appeared on the Today show on Monday to slam . Obamacare and said she rejected President Obama's apology over the slow, beleaguered start to the new health plan. Dismissal: She refused to back New Jersey governor Chris Christie as a 2016 . presidential candidate . Wading in: Speaking to Matt Lauer, she said Christie had been better than other candidates in New Jersey . Favorite: Chris Christie is pictured after defeating Democratic challenger Barbara Buono last week . 'What apology?' she asked. 'The broken website is the least of America's worries. It's symbolic of broken government.' She praised some of her party members, including Ted Cruz, for standing up against Obamacare, but slammed others for allowing the end of the shutdown without defunding the bill. But when pressed to say what the tea party would replace Obama's program with, Palin said only that an alternative plan should involve such things as a more free-market approach and tort reform. 'Most Americans will not be able to keep policy and programs that they had desired,' she argued. 'The new policies are unaffordable.'

Now, one artist has immortalised perhaps the most difficult, mind-bending masterpieces of them all: MC Escher’s Relativity. The iconic print, with its gravity-defying stairs, bridges and passageways, depicts a world in which normal physical laws do not apply. Scroll down for video... Riccardo Zangelmi used 9,000 pieces to construct the 3D model of MC Escher's 'Relativity' over 15 days . The print depicts a world in which there are three sources of gravity and sixteen characters who live in different 'gravity wells'. There are seven stairways, and each stairway can be used by people who belong to two different gravity wells. This means that, for example, inhabitants are depicted as climbing the stairways upside-down, but based on their own gravity source, they are climbing normally. VIDEO: An animation of MC Escher's Relativity . This complex structure didn’t stop Italian Riccardo Zangelmi from painstakingly recreating the impossible-looking world. Mr Zangelmi used 9,000 pieces to construct the 3D model over the course of 15 days for the Foundation Magnani in Italy. The . piece will be on display for four months during an exhibition in Parma, . Italy, dedicated to Escher, alongside his original works. Dutch artist Escher is best known for his mathematical inspired woodcuts, lithographs, and mezzotints. He also produced impossible architectural constructions and tessellations that often explore the theme of infinity. This isn’t the first time that he has captured the imagination of Lego artists. Two years ago, Andrew Lipson from Cambridge carefully assembled thousands of Lego bricks over many weeks to create a number of incredible Escher pieces. Mr Lipson would not reveal how he managed to achieve the seemingly impossible angles and mind-boggling perspectives found in his creations. This isn't the first time that he has captured the imagination of Lego artists. Two years ago, Andrew Lipson from Cambridge carefully assembled thousands of Lego bricks over many weeks to create a number of incredible Escher pieces including 'Balcony' (pictured) However, he confirmed that he did not used glue or any other adhesive to keep the Lego blocks in place. ‘The whole problem with 'Balcony' was figuring out exactly what distortion Escher had used and reversing it to get an undistorted view of his picture,’ he said. 'I then had to build a Lego copy of that and then distort a photograph of the result.’ MC Escher was born in Leeuwarden in the Netherlands in 1924. By the time he died in 1974 his drawings of impossible structures made him one of the most celebrated graphic artists of the 20th Century.","Iconic print depicts a world in which normal laws of gravity do not apply .

The final curtain is falling on the remaining Blockbuster stores that Dish Network Corp. runs in the U.S. The closures announced Wednesday will affect about 300 Blockbuster locations scattered around the country. As part of Dish Network's retreat, Blockbuster's DVD-by-mail service is also shutting down next month. No happy end: Dish Network announced it will close the remaining 300 Blockbuster locations scattered across the United States by early January . About 2,800 people who work in Blockbuster's stores and DVD distribution centers will lose their jobs, according to Dish Network. The cost-cutting measures culminate a Blockbuster downfall that began a decade ago with the rise of Netflix's DVD-by-mail service, followed by the introduction of a subscription service that streams video over high-speed Internet connections. 1985: Founder David Cook opens the first Blockbuster store in Dallas, Texas . 1987: Blockbuster is sold to a trio of investors, including Waste Management Inc. founder Wayne Huizenga, for $18.5million . 1992: Blockbuster is the video rental leader, with over 2,800 stores worldwide. The company’s growth is driven by acquisitions of other retailers such as UK’s Ritz and American chains Major Video and Erol’s Video . 1994: Viacom buys Blockbuster for $8.4billion . 1997: Silicon Valley executive Reed Hastings founds Netflix after being fined $40 by Blockbuster for being late in returning ‘Apollo 13’ 1999: Viacom takes Blockbuster public, retaining its stake in the firm in order to take advantage of its steady cash flow . 2002: Netflix goes public . 2004: Blockbuster is at its peak, with about 9,100 stores worldwide. Activist financier Carl Icahn begins amassing a stake in Blockbuster to get on the company’s board . 2007: Blockbuster CEO John Antioco steps down after a falling out with Icahn . 2010: Blockbuster files for bankruptcy protections to wipe out around $1billion in debt. As a senior bondholder, Icahn receives a large equity stake . 2011: Dish Network buys the assets of Blockbuster for $234million in cash at auction . 2012: Dish announces plans to close some of its stores, despite plans to use the stores to sell mobile phones . Source: Quartz.com . ‘This is not an easy decision, yet consumer demand is clearly moving to digital distribution of video entertainment,’ Dish Network CEO Joseph Clayton said in a statement. The once-successful Blockbuster video-store giant traces its roots to a single store that opened October 1985 in Dallas, Texas. The founder of the company, David Cook, used the revenue from the first several stores he had opened to build a massive warehouse and expand his growing empire. In late 1980s, the company was sold to John Melk and Wayne Huizenga, former executives at Waste Management, who greatly expanded the company, opening one store every 24 hours. The turning point for Blockbuster came in 1997, when Silicon Valley executive Reed Hastings launched Netflix, which went public five years later. After several years of corporate infighting and declining sales, Blockbuster hit a low point in 2010 when it filed for bankruptcy protection. The shift has been a boon for Netflix Inc., which now boasts 31 million subscribers to its Internet video service and another 7.1million DVD-by-mail customers. The company's success has minted Netflix with a market value of $20billion. But Blockbuster absorbed huge losses. It closed thousands of its stores before landing in bankruptcy court three years ago. Dish Network bought Blockbuster's remnants for about $234million in 2011 and then tried to mount a challenge to Netflix. But Dish Network couldn't wring a profit from Blockbuster either, prompting even more store closures. Last year, the parent company shuttered 500 Blockbuster stores - about a third of its remaining brick-and-mortar retail centers. The Englewood, Colo., satellite-TV provider had already closed about 500 Blockbuster stores this year. Parent company: Dish Network bought Blockbuster's remnants for about $234million in 2011 and then tried to mount a challenge to Netflix . Big winner: Netflix now boasts 31 million subscribers to its Internet video service and another 7.1million DVD-by-mail customers . The latest closures, scheduled to be completed by early January, will leave the U.S. with just 50 Blockbuster stores operating under franchise agreements. The chain's near extinction serves as another stark reminder of how quickly technology can reshape industries. Just a decade ago, Blockbuster reigned as one of the country's most ubiquitous retailers with 9,100 stores in the U.S. Dish Network is trying to keep the Blockbuster brand alive through an Internet video-streaming service that rents movies and TV shows by title, for a set viewing time. Blockbuster suffered an operating loss of $35million on revenue of $1.1billion last year and posted an operating loss of $4million during the first half of this year, according to regulatory filings.","Dish Network, which owns Blockbuster, will complete store closures in early January .

Murdered: Sida Osman was beaten to death with a bowling ball by a 13-year-old boy in June - who was sentenced to 23-years in jail today in Fort Worth, Texas . A Texas teenager who battered a 5-year-old to death with a bowling ball 'like a football player spiking a football' has been sentenced to 23-years behind bars today. Sida Osman was horrifically beaten round the head by the unidentified teen - who was 13 at the time of the attack in June - after going for a bike ride and running into the older boy. Angry at the younger boys constant pleas to help him go to the store, the teen picked up a 14-pound bowling ball and threw it at Sida's head, knocking him to the ground, then straddled him and pounded the ball onto the 5-year-old's head till he crushed his skull. Eighteen hours after the murder, which occurred in the backyard of a vacant house in Fort Worth, the teen went to get three friends and showed them the younger boys dead body. Shocked, they demanded he call an ambulance, but the teenager stopped them and then in a callous act he denied knowing where Sida was when the boy's frantic mother asked him later on the street if he had seen her missing boy. Sobs were heard in the Fort Worth juvenile court as the teen pleaded guilty to the capital murder of his neighbor and accepted a plea deal of 23-years behind bars. Scroll Down for Video .

'There were tears all over that courtroom,' said Assistant District Attorney Riley Shaw, who handled the case along with prosecutor Brock Groom. 'They were real tears form real people. This is a horrific, horrific case.' The defendant will remain in the juvenile justice system until he's 19, at which time he'll likely be transferred to the adult prison system according to the Fort Worth Star Telegram. The teens defense attorney Ray Hall Jr. characterized the boy as one suffering from mental illness growing up without a father who is currently in prison.

Distressing testimony heard in court revealed how the teen beat the little boy until he stopped convulsing on the ground and 'because Sida kept bothering and pestering him to go to the store.' Sida Osman's mother, whose family moved to North Texas to escape violence in Somalia, spoke through a translator when she took the witness stand.

The 27-year-old driver was originally charged with intoxication manslaughter, but on Wednesday she appeared in court and tearfully pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. During an emotional hearing, the victim’s father, Gary Whittington, spoke directly to Rackley, saying that he forgave her for causing his son's death. The father hugged the woman and also handed her a care package containing self-help books on grief, prayers and a letter Mr Whittington had written from the point of view of his dead son. ‘I don't feel qualified to be God here,’ said Gary Whittington. ‘We want the least amount of punishment for the most results,’ according to the station KXAN.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey unveiled a package of reforms in the energy market . Energy bosses will face jail under plans to make the fixing of household fuel bills a crime. Ed Davey, the Energy Secretary, yesterday said specific criminal penalties would apply to ‘manipulation of the energy markets’. Modelled on those for the financial markets, where the maximum prison sentence for insider dealing is seven years, the details will be unveiled next year after a consultation. Officials said they would apply to firms that artificially inflate prices to a level not justified by market forces or give inaccurate information about generating capacity or wholesale prices. MPs claimed yesterday that the Big Six energy firms appear to operate as a ‘cartel’. This prompted a furious response from nPower chief executive Paul Massara who tweeted: ‘Lots of wild talk about cartels but no evidence and the facts don’t support. Where is the evidence? Put up or shut up.’ Npower announced this month it would be putting up prices by 10.4 per cent for its 3.1million customers from December 1. It was the third of the Big Six to announce huge rises this winter – although regulator Ofgem says wholesale prices have only risen by 1.7 per cent in the last 12 months. In profile: The top five cheapest deals compared to the top five long-term fixed price deals are set out above . Under Mr Davey’s plans, energy firms would be forced to ‘open up their books’ so regulators can see the costs and profits of every arm of their business. He also pledged to reduce red tape to enable households to switch between energy firms within 24 hours. Currently it can take five weeks. A look at current deals in the marketplace shows families can save up to £376 a year by switching from the most expensive variable tariffs. Energy prices have dominated the agenda in recent weeks as the average dual fuel bill reaches £1,400 a year and Labour promises to freeze prices for 20 months if it wins the next election. The price hikes will add £50 to every family's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £100 . Ministers say there must be more . transparency about how wholesale prices feed through to bills, and have . promised an annual ‘competition test’ by regulators. 'The energy market needs to change to put consumers in control' Ed Davey, Energy Secretary . But . analysts expressed doubts about it, saying the energy market has been . investigated several times over the past decade and no wrongdoing has . been found. Ofgem’s latest . Retail Market Review in 2011 found no evidence of a cartel, but ordered . firms to slash the number of tariffs they offer. The . regulator has powers to fine a company 10 per cent of turnover and has . imposed fines and redress worth £70million since 2010. Mr Davey said: ‘The energy market needs to change to put consumers in control. Slump: Just 341,000 people changed gas and electricity supplier in June this year, less than half of the numbers who switched in summer 2011 . 'That . means making it easy for people to change supplier to save money, it . means regular market assessments to check their behaviour, and it means . tougher penalties for market manipulation and putting an end to opaque . finances. ‘Energy companies . need to know that any wrongdoing will be uncovered and dealt with.’ Tory . and Labour MPs claimed the Big Six operate as a ‘cartel’. Labour’s . Ian Lavery said there was evidence for a ‘hidden, protected, secret . sort of cartel trading scheme’ whereby energy companies trade with each . other at above the wholesale price before passing the increases on to . consumers. He was told Labour should hand over any evidence it has about wrongdoing. David .

A dedicated mother who lost eight stone in just 17 months through diet and exercise claims she has been refused surgery - because she chose not to have a gastric band. Morbidly obese Sarah Whitaker, 32, of Highworth, Wilts. dropped more than six dress sizes after she was warned by her GP she might not see her three-year-old daughter grow up. Her hardwork saw her slim down to just 15st 5lb, from a life-threatening 23st 6lb, but as a result she was left with folds of excess skin. But when she asked her GP for surgery to remove the skin she was told the NHS would refuse because she not been fitted with a gastric band.

Sarah said: 'I decided to start losing weight as I had seen myself in pictures and I wasn't happy.'I was also told by my GP that if I carried on I could get diabetes and heart disease and might not see my daughter growing up. 'That's when I started the fitness camps and, although it was hard, the results kept me going. 'But now I have excess skin around my stomach and it is uncomfortable. It does not look very nice. 'It is getting to the stage it's getting in the way, I would be at least a clothes size smaller if I didn't have it. 'It affects my confidence, I essentially have a skirt of skin, the most weight I lose the more it becomes visible.

It is estimated that having a gastric band - a device around the stomach to reduce the amount of food eaten - costs between £8,000 and £14,000. Aesthetic skin removal surgery costs from £1,500 to £6,000. Administrator Sarah began her weight loss journey in January 2012.

Joanne Baker, the owner of NKD Fitness Camps in Swindon, said: 'Sarah has worked extremely hard, has become more confident and her personality shines. 'I am disgusted that the NHS would rather obese individuals go through gastric bypass than learn good eating habits and be educated for a lifelong healthy future.' An NHS Swindon Clinical Commissioning Group spokesman said: 'We are unable to comment on individual cases. 'The removal of excess skin is generally considered to be a cosmetic procedure, which is not routinely funded. 'The Swindon Clinical Commissioning Group policy for this procedure says in exceptional circumstances surgical intervention may be considered for patients who have reduced their weight by 50 per cent.

Millions of women invited for breast cancer screening will now get a leaflet explaining the drawbacks for the first time. The old leaflets were condemned as ‘patronising’ by experts because they exaggerated the benefits and did not spell out the risks. As a result, women could not make a properly informed choice about whether screening was right for them. Millions of women invited for breast cancer screening will now get a leaflet explaining the drawbacks for the first time. This will help them make an informed decision about whether to have the screening . Mounting controversy over whether women were getting the full picture led to a major review into the NHS screening programme by the internationally recognised public health expert Professor Sir Michael Marmot. The review concluded screening saves around 1,300 lives each year, but leads to 4,000 women having treatment for cancer they never needed. It found one per cent of all women going for NHS screening over 20 years would end up ‘overdiagnosed’ with cancer. This means they had cancer under the microscope but would not have had symptoms during their lifetime because the cancers were slow growing or non-aggressive. The review led to a recommendation last year from Professor Sir Mike Richards, former National Clinical Director for Cancer, that the leaflets be updated. In future women should be given ‘clear and accessible’ information before they go for a breast X-ray, or mammogram, so they could make up their own minds. From today the NHS Cancer Screening . Programmes will begin to use a new invitation letter and accompanying . leaflet for women over 50 invited for screening every three years. The . letter tells the woman it’s ‘your choice’ whether or not to have . screening, while the leaflet says some women will be diagnosed and . treated for breast cancer that would otherwise never have been found or . caused them harm. The old leaflets were condemned as 'patronising' by experts because they exaggerated the benefits and did not spell out the risks. Image shows breast cancer cells . The leaflet spells out in bold type: ‘Overall, for every woman who has her life saved from breast cancer, about three women are diagnosed with a cancer that would never have become life-threatening.’ This is because at present doctors cannot accurately identify cancers that will shorten life expectancy. The leaflet says researchers are trying to find better ways to tell which women have breast cancers that could be fatal and which do not. Statistics from the review are included, with women being told that 4,000 of those going for screening each year will be offered treatment that’s unnecessary. Other risks include the worry and distress affecting women given an abnormal result that turns out to be wrong. The leaflet also says having a breast X-ray every three years for 20 years will itself very slightly increase the chance of cancer over a women’s lifetime. And cancer will be missed in about one in 2,500 women screened, according to the leaflet. Following a public consultation, the leaflet was drafted and tested with a Citizen’s Jury, in which 25 women were asked how they would like the information about the benefits and risks of breast screening to be presented. Under the NHS screening programme, women are invited for three-yearly mammograms between the ages of 50 and 70 years. The age limits are being extended to 47-73. Almost two million women in the UK are screened each year. There have been fears some women will be deterred from attending for an X-ray by learning about the drawbacks which could make the programme, costing an estimated £96 million a year in England, less effective. Screening saves around 1,300 lives each year, but leads to 4,000 women having treatment they never needed. This is because doctors cannot tell whether cancer cells will become a problem or not . Professor Julietta Patnick, director of the NHS Cancer Screening Programmes, said: ‘We believe that the leaflet now available to women provides a balanced assessment of the benefits and risks of breast screening and will support them as they decide whether to attend their screening appointment.’ Professor Sir Michael Marmot, chair of the independent breast screening review panel, said: ‘My review of breast screening concluded that screening contributes to reducing deaths from breast cancer in women. ‘However, there are potential risks as well as benefits associated with breast screening, and it is important women are given information that is clear and accessible before they go for a mammogram.’ Sean Duffy, National Clinical Director for Cancer Services, said: ‘These new materials were developed following rigorous consultation with experts, and with women from the target audience. ‘The new materials will provide each woman with the clear, accurate information she needs to make a personal decision about whether to attend for breast screening.’","Women will now be given a new leaflet explaining drawbacks .

The Holy Grail of fashion is how to dress the bigger, older woman without making her feel patronised, ripped off or marginalised. Many have tried. Clothing tags at plus-size shop Evans show if the style will suit an apple or pear shape, and the brand hired trendy design duo Clements Ribeiro to create a collection, where the designers broke all the ‘big girl rules’ by using patterns, stripes and showing bare flesh. Marks & Spencer is also making an attempt with its new lines for bigger women, which use a more accurate mannequin, better fabrics, and seams, darts and waistbands. Into the fray comes Marisota, the online retailer, which caters for the plus-size and over-35 woman who loves fashion. Black & gold brocade jacket, £79, lace top, £40, maroon jeans, £40, gold snakeskin shoes, £35 . And of all the brands, I would wager it has done its homework. So, could this be the label to change the way larger women shop for ever? I went to view its autumn/winter range at its lab in Manchester, where Marisota employs ten buyers, five fabric technologists and six ‘shapeologists’. I met one such shapeologist, Hannah Pemberton, who says her role is about being a ‘creative planner’. If, like me, you don’t know what that means, she can enlighten us: ‘It’s my job to empathise and understand what goes on in a woman’s head — how she thinks and feels about her looks and body, and how confident she is.’ She does this by listening to women. And she has listened to a lot — 1,500 of them from size 12 (which is where Marisota starts) to a size 32, aged 40 to 70. So what did Marisota find out? A whopping 77 per cent want to hide their stomachs. Nearly half struggle to find clothes that suit their shape. More than 79 per cent want to hide their flaws, while 81 per cent want to enhance their best bits (I can’t think why this wasn’t 100 per cent for both). Most of them get style help from their daughters, a huge number avoid social outings because they have nothing to wear, and most are repelled by negative language in advertising — words such as ‘repair’ and ‘fix’. Finally, the brand found that as we get older we are less obsessed with size and more interested in our shape. Floral dress with inbuilt Spanx, £65, gold snakeskin shoes, as before . Leopard print coat, £130, lace top, as before, black tuxedo trousers, £35, court shoes, as before . Marisota has used fabric technology to ensure every garment has some sort of hidden panelling and support, as well as clever colour blocking (think Stella McCartney’s famous trompe l’oeil red carpet dress; it’s no surprise to discover a consultant on the brand is stylist Cheryl Konteh, who dresses Kate Winslet) to give its wearer a waist. Best of all, it has a bespoke service, so if you happen to be top heavy, say, you can have a dress adjusted to suit. All this, plus wide-fit boots and shoes, and lingerie with bras that go up to an L — the biggest cup size available in the UK. But what of the new, cutting-edge autumn/ winter collection? It is all monochrome, which apparently is what bigger women want. There are sleeves, lace panels, and secret support for tummies and buttocks, even in a very floaty floral dress, at just £50. There is a great pencil skirt with a patterned panel that really does slim the hips, at £35, and a bodycon illusion dress, £45. Red coat, £49, Aztec panel skirt, £35, . white lace top, £40, heels, £30 . There is a lovely pink pea coat, £55, that I prefer to the more tweedy coats, which I imagine big women will think makes them look even chunkier. Similarly, a poncho-style sweater would, I think, make a larger women feel like a house. Shirts, at £25 to £35, cleverly don’t gape at the bust, and the sleeves are neither too narrow nor too voluminous. Fabrics aren’t  natural or top notch, but you do need Lycra or Elastane to hold bits and bobs in, so I will let them off. My only gripe, but it’s a big one, is that the campaign has been shot on a size 12 model. The brand managers say this is what shoppers want, but do we, really? The model in the promotional video is thin. So we put some pieces on a model who is a size 16, and I think they look even better. Bodycon dress, £45, snakeskin handbag, £60, heels as before . Grey check and dogstooth dress, £65, court shoes, £35, envelope clutch, £25 . I like the stretchy tuxedo trousers — they have a  stripe that’s slimming, as is the high waist — and the metallic jacket, though I’d have added vents to give it a kick. On the whole, though, shapes are a bit boxy, which meant we added bulldog clips at the back to ‘nip’, and the sleeves a little too wide. My best buy is the faux Stella McCartney tote with chains, £55. I’m assured the festive collection will be more fun, without making us look like Christmas trees. Let’s hope they have the courage, having seen our photo shoot, to use a model who is truly representative.

While men are traditionally seen to be the more gadget-savvy sex, it is actually women who own the most tablet devices, according to the latest research. A new study found that women now own over half of all the tablets in the UK. Last year women owned 43 per cent of UK tablet devices, now tech-loving women own 52 per cent. Tech-savvy: Women now own over half of all the tablet devices in the UK as they get to grips with gadgets . This change is seemingly driven by women snapping up older devices such as iPads 1 and 2 (60 per cent are owned by women), and also the newer iPad Mini model (58 per cent of owners are female). John Gilbert, Lead Director at YouGov Technology and Telecoms, told The Telegraph: 'The early adopters of tablets have typically been affluent males. 'As they buy the latest models, they have placed their old devices on to the secondary market or give them to other members of their household. 'A growing number of females and under-35s own older tablets, such as the iPad 1 and 2 while affluent males have the more recent iPad 3 and 4 and Samsung devices.' Gadget girls: The share of tablets owned by men has, however, fallen from 57 per cent to 48 per cent, whilst women have been snapping up old iPads . The research also looked at the ages of UK tablet owners and found that the highest growth is being driven by 18-34 year olds.

When Margaret Pabst Battin's husband Brooke Hopkins broke his neck in a cycling accident and became almost completely paralyzed, she had to face her ideas about a person's right to die in a devastatingly personal way. As an international leader in the euthanasia movement, the Professor of philosophy and bioethics at the University of Utah has written 'wheelbarrows full' about the right to death for terminally . ill and seriously injured people. Battin's husband, Brooke Hopkins, was 66 at the time of his accident . in 2008. He was cycling down a hill in City Creek Canyon in Utah when . he collided with another bicycle and somersaulted in the air, severing . his spinal cord when he landed on his neck. A question of life or death: Brooke Hopkins is prepped for surgery in 2010 as Peggy Battin and son Mike look on . Expert: An authority on the ethics surrounding death, Battin is now facing her own husband's choice to die . One year earlier, he . had updated his living will to include the clause that should he suffer . an illness or injury that left him in a vegetative state, he didn't want . any treatment that 'would serve only to unnaturally prolong the moment . of my death and to unnaturally postpone or prolong the dying process.' But . emergency services didn't know about this will, and Brooke Hopkins was . kept alive until he reached the hospital where he was placed on a . ventilator, thus saving his life and creating for himself and his wife . the ultimate quandary: life or death. Battin, 72, who is known as Peggy, traces her interest in assisted suicide, euthanasia and the right to a dignified death back to her mother's painful and difficult death of liver cancer when Battin was 21. 'A person should be accorded the right to live his or her life as they see fit (provided, of course, that this does not significantly harm others), and that includes the very end of their life,' she has written in one of her nearly 40 journal articles on this subject. The terrible injury of her husband of 30 years hasn't changed Battin's core belief in self-determination, but it's revealed complexities in the issue she wasn't prepared for, not least her own unwillingness to let go of her beloved husband and his reluctance to leave her when he knows she doesn't want him to. Beloved: Brooke Hopkins has continued to teach, read and write prodigiously after his devastating accident . There's also decoding what Hopkins really does want. Before his accident, Hopkins was a gregarious, fit, adventurous outdoorsman with a passion for the English romantic poets. He has a doctorate from Harvard and worked at the University of Utah as an English professor. 'At parties he was the one who ate the most, drank the most, talked the loudest, danced the longest,' a friend told The New York Times. Now, Hopkins has good days and bad days. One bad day in 2012 resulted in the drafting of his 'Final Letter' when his pain became unbearable. 'Pain eats away at your soul,' The New York Times reports he wrote on July 28, 2012, using his voice-recognition software to dictate the letter to his loved ones. 'For many years since the accident I have been motivated by a deep will to live and to contribute to the benefit of others in my small way. I think I have done that. And I am proud of it. But as I have told Peggy over the past few months, I knew that I would reach a limit to what I could do. And I have arrived at the limit over the past couple of weeks.' Advocate: Two of the books Margaret 'Peggy' Battin has written on the subject of assisted suicide . For Peggy Battin, helping her husband . to hasten his death when there's a chance that he might have changed his mind later is a fear that often overrides what . Hopkins tells her at any given moment. Making a decision that cannot . be undone must be weighed with her own intuition of what Hopkins may . feel in the future. Death and dying: Peggy Battin has had to face the realities of her scholarly explorations since her husband's accident . Battin . told The New York Times that there have been times she's taken Hopkins . to the hospital when he became ill and he later told her she did the . right thing, despite indicating on other occasions he wants no medical . intervention. She doesn't . believe her husband has yet made the decision to die, but rather his . occasional desire to end it all is dependent on pain he might be . feeling, or influenced by medications he's taking. In . 2012, following his Final Letter, Hopkins became seriously ill with . pleural effusion, or liquid in the chest cavity, and had trouble . breathing. Despite his indication prior that he was ready to die, Battin . rushed him to the ER. Battin told The New York Times that she'd discussed with her husband the kind of death he wanted, and this delirious, uncomfortable state was not how he wished to go. New pain management medications were administered, and now Hopkins says he thinks of his hospitalization with pleural effusion as having a 'happy ending.' On good days, Hopkins can do the things that give his life meaning: teaching, writing, reading and interacting with his loved ones. His living will states that he was not to be assisted with sustenance and hydration, but Hopkins can no longer eat and is fed through a tube, and the once-active professor is trapped in his wheelchair, with an army of helpers to attend to his physical needs. Battin still believes in people's right to choose when and how we die, but her experiences with her husband have shown her is that each individual case is rife with diverse and conflicting issues. 'What has changed,' she told The New York Times, 'is my sense of how extremely complex, how extremely textured, any particular case is.' According to The Salt Lake Tribune, Hopkins and Battin are writing a book about their experiences in the wake of Brooke Hopkins' accident. Peggy Battin has continued to advocate for people who want to die and for legislation for doctors to be able to 'hasten death' in the terminally ill (for which there is provision in Oregon, Washington, Montana and Vermont so far). Brooke Hopkins, now 71, has again expressed a wish to die, according to The New York Times. He has planned his death for the spring of 2014, when he will be finished teaching his latest course, on Don Quixote. Only time will tell whether he, and his wife Peggy, will make that choice. Peggy Battin and Brooke Hopkins wrote in their last blog entry to date: . 'This story doesn’t end, and it . doesn’t need to be a tragedy. It’s . still a story of love, even if it’s love under trial. It doesn’t end as long as we’re here to . write it, and it isn’t a tragedy if we can keep from letting ourselves think . so.  But we’re also aware of the . knife-edge we walk all the time, when the story could end not because we didn’t . have anything more to say, but because we weren’t here anymore to say it.'","Margaret Battin is a bioethicist and leader in the right-to-die movement .

New 'Tonight Show' host Jimmy Fallon will more than double his multi-million dollar salary when he takes over from outgoing host Jay Leno next year on the top-rated NBC show. Industry insiders predict that Fallon will see the $5 million he gets for fronting 'The Late Show' boosted to $12 million when he goes head-to-head with CBS' David Letterman and ABC's Jimmy Kimmel in February. Even though that is three million less than the $15 million Leno reportedly takes home, it still represents a massive show of faith in Fallon, who has been working late night television for less than five years. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Smooth transition: NBC executives hoped for the best possible timing of the move, picking after the Winter Olympics which give them their largest audience to hype Fallon . Bitter? Jay Leno kept up the assault on NBC execs in his show last night after numerous monologues making fun of bosses . NBC announced today that Jay Leno, . the longtime host of The Tonight Show, will leave the program and will . be replaced by Jimmy Fallon next year. The move, anticipated for weeks now, will officially take place following the network's broadcast of the Winter Olympics. The . 62-year-old Leno - who was temporarily removed from the show in 2009 in . favor of Conan O'Brien - had made repeated jokes about his bosses and . the network in recent weeks while rumors swirled over the latest move. But . he and Fallon, 38, presented a united front while announcing the news. They recently made a parody video set to a tune from West Side Story . that lampooned their situation. 'The main difference between this and . the other time is I’m part of the process. The last time the decision . was made without me. I came into work one day and — you’re out,' Leno . said, comparing his previous ouster and now. 'This time around there really aren’t any complications like there were the last time,' he added, according to the New York Times. 'This time it feels right.' Leno, whose salary was a reported $15 . million following a recent pay cut, also said in a press release: . 'Congratulations Jimmy. I hope you're as lucky as me and hold on to the . job until you're the old guy. If you need me, I'll be at the garage.' Laughing his way to the bank: Leno has been on an anti-NBC joke offensive since reports emerged saying Fallon, pictured, would be replacing him at Tonight . Fallon, whose Late Night show began at 12:35 a.m., added: 'I’m really excited to host a show that starts today instead of tomorrow.' 'I have nothing but respect for Jay,' Fallon said. 'If it weren’t for him, I wouldn’t have a show to be taking over.' Fallon currently earns $5 million as host of Late Night and it is predicted he could earn as much as $12 million in his new role, according to Forbes Magazine. The exact terms of his new deal were not immediately disclosed. But the show will be relocated from Los Angeles to New York, where the program started in 1954 when Steve Allen was its host. Leno - aside from the brief interruption when O'Brien hosted the program - has been the show's presenter since 1992. He has routinely been tops in the ratings, even as NBC's primetime and daytime programming has fallen off. 'I’m glad I’ve kept it No. 1,” Leno said. 'When I started people said, ""Oh the only reason you’re winning is because of ‘ER,"" or ""The only reason you’re winning is because Hugh Grant came on and said that one thing."" Well, at least now I can say the only reason we’re winning is cause we’re winning.' After leaving, he said he expects to be 'back on the road, being a comedian again.' In . competition? Jay Leno and Jimmy Fallon have been the mainstay of NBC's . late night schedule for the past three years with reports now saying . Fallon will take over Tonight . 'Saturday Night Live' producer Lorne . Michaels, who also produces 'Late Night', will take over as producer of . the new 'Tonight Show.' Fallon's replacement at 12:35 a.m. was not named, although Seth Meyers of ""SNL"" is considered a strong candidate. NBC . is worried that ABC's Jimmy Kimmel, whose show recently started at the . 11:35 p.m. time slot,  will establish himself as a go-to late night . performer for a younger generation if the network didn't move swiftly to . install Fallon. Kimmel took to Twitter to jokingly offer his congratulations to his new counterpart. 'Congratulations to my dear, sweet @jimmyfallon - a formidable rival and an incredible lover.' But . the move also has the potential to backfire with Leno's fans, who did . not embrace Conan O'Brien when Leno was temporarily moved to prime time a . few years ago. O'Brien held . onto the job for just eight months before being replaced by his . predecessor. O'Brien now hosts a show on cable network TBS. Next generation?: With Fallon's ascension to the top chair, Seth Myers, right, is considered the favorite to take over the 12:35 a.m. show . Conan O'Brien briefly replaced Leno as host of The Tonight Show in 2009 until NBC executives reversed their decision. He now hosts a show on TBS . Leno, whose contract expires next year, hasn't always sounded so gracious over Fallon taking over. He has recently used comedy as a weapon against his network . bosses - branding a recent ratings boost a 'miracle' and saying that NBC . is a 'big number two' in his show. 'You know what that means? Between . Easter and Passover, this is truly the season of miracles. We’re number . two! I’ve been saying for the last week that NBC is a big number two. Haven’t I been saying that? Congratulations!' Hit with youth: Jimmy Fallon has proved remarkably popular and executives believe his age and appeal to younger viewers will keep Tonight on top for years to come . Leno went on to talk about a report that T-Mobile is reducing its contracts, adding: 'Apparently they got the idea from NBC.' The routine comes hot on the heels of other cutting remarks against executives at the network. Leno had also joked about a 'make-nice' meeting he had with bosses the night before. He said to make amends they had . offered to send him and his wife on a Carnival cruise - the crippled . liner that caused passengers to endure five nightmarish days in the Gulf . of Mexico. In another wisecrack, Leno cited news . reports of a Canadian man who had a knife pulled from his back after . three years, he sniped: 'He must have worked at NBC, too.' Rising star: Jimmy Fallon is photographed with SNL creator/producer Lorne Michaels. Fallon will be Leno's replacement on Tonight, which will be executive produced by Michaels . In another routine he referred to his bosses as 'snakes.' 'You know the whole . legend of St. Patrick right? St. Patrick drove all the snakes out of Ireland . – and then they came to the United States and became NBC executives.' The rapid ascent of Fallon and his . certain promotion is seen by analysts as NBC recognizing the competition . offered by ABC's popular Jimmy Kimmel. While Leno's 'Tonight' show still tops . the ratings, Kimmel moved his show to the earlier time-slot of 11.35pm to directly compete with him and CBS' David Letterman. The Times report quoted one senior executive as saying, 'There is no way on earth that this is not going to happen' - a certainty which may explain why Leno isn't holding back the abuse. 'According to several reports, . scientists say they are getting closer and closer to being able to do . Jurassic Park-style cloning of extinct species,' Leno, he told his . audience one night. 'Imagine that. Things that were once . thought to be extinct could be brought back from the dead. So there’s . hope for NBC. It could turn around.'","The transition will take place following next year's Winter Olympics .

The mother of an eight-year-old boy receiving radiotherapy for a brain tumour has said his spirit has been crushed by the treatment. Sally Roberts told ITV’s Daybreak programme that Neon’s co-ordination had been affected by the cancer treatment and her son was 'feeling pretty rubbish', despite doctors telling her he was on the mend. Ms Roberts, a New Zealander living in Brighton, East Sussex, appeared on the television show ahead of a documentary, You’re Killing My Son: The Mum Who Went On The Run, which will be shown on Channel 4 tonight. Sally Roberts told ITV's Daybreak programme that Neon's co-ordination had been affected by the cancer treatment and her son was 'feeling pretty rubbish', despite doctors telling her he was on the mend . Footage shown on Daybreak showed Neon’s father Ben telling documentary-makers that his wife, from whom he is separated, kidnapped his son and took him on the run 'at a time when he needed critical treatment'. Ms Roberts, 38, lost a legal battle to stop her son receiving radiotherapy treatment, which she believed would cause Neon to suffer long-term harm, after the removal of the tumour last October. Doctors argued that her son would die within three months if he did not receive the treatment. Following the ruling, Ms Roberts and her son disappeared but were found four days later. Ms Roberts told Daybreak she still believed that there were alternative treatments for her son which would not have such a damaging effect on him. She said: 'I think his co-ordination and his spirit have been crushed. He’s very much feeling pretty rubbish.' She said that although doctors have told her Neon is doing well, she found it a 'strange description'. Ms Roberts, 38, lost a legal battle to stop her son receiving radiotherapy treatment, which she believed would cause Neon to suffer long-term harm, after the removal of the tumour last October . She said: 'He’s hiding away from the world, always building dens around himself. 'The treatment itself is a carcinogenic immuno-suppressor for salt on the body. There are a multitude of other treatments out there. 'I have mentioned before the proton therapy for less invasive treatment. That does not do nearly as much damage to the surrounding tissue. It is more targeted, more localised, and does not do the whole brain.' Ms Roberts said she felt she and her son had been railroaded into the treatment offered by the NHS and there were other medical experts out there who could help. She said: 'I was contacted by a proton therapy expert from the States who was willing to take him (Neon) on.' Presenter Kate Garraway said: 'This therapy has the same sort of statistical results of success, does it, as the one that’s used by the NHS to treat this kind of problem?' Ms Roberts replied: 'Yes, that’s right. It will be used from 2017 and the population here is less than somewhere like America or China where they are using it already.'","Sally Roberts, 38, lost legal battle .

A mother who abducted four of her five children in a tug-of-love dispute has spoken for the first time of the dramatic moment 15 police officers armed with Tasers stormed their secret hideaway. Jennifer Jones, 47, went on the run with her two boys and two girls  to prevent them being returned to their father in Spain. But after a nationwide search, police tracked her through her mobile phone to a guesthouse in Caerphilly, South Wales. ‘Four or five squad cars arrive outside and about 15 officers swarmed into the building with Tasers in their hands,’ said Miss Jones in an interview with The Mail on Sunday. ‘They put me in handcuffs...and the four children were taken away to a police station.’ Since that day last October she has not been allowed to see her two youngest children, Eva, ten, and David, eight. ‘I feel so terrible for them in particular because in my heart I feel I let them down because ultimately  I couldn’t stop their father taking them back to Spain,’ said Miss Jones, an English teacher. And she revealed that four days before she went into hiding, she was told by a policeman that it was clear to him her children didn’t want to go back to Spain. Miss Jones claims he told her: ‘I know what I would do if I was in your position – I would go down for my kids if it came to it...You are their mother and you have got to do what you think is the right thing.’ Last week she had the threat of jail lifted from her at the High Court in London where she was cleared of contempt of court charges for failing to hand over her children. Sir James Munby, president of the Family Division, ruled she had not wilfully breached the order. Final custody is still to be agreed. Happier times: Ex-husband Tomas Palacin Cambra with children, from left, Tomas, Sara, Eva, Jessica and David . As it stands, two of the children, Jessica, 15, and 13-year-old Tomas, remain with their mother in Wales while Miss Jones’s eldest daughter, Sara, 17, lives in Spain with her father, Lieutenant Colonel Tomas Palacin Cambra, and her younger brother and sister. Describing how events unfolded after her arrest when her ex-husband collected the children from the police station, Miss Jones said: ‘The only reason Jessica and Tomas were not handed over was because the social workers and a police officer who were present stepped in. ‘Jessica and Tomas were old enough and big enough to physically resist. I’m so impressed at how they stood up to their father that day. ‘The policeman then stepped in and told him to leave them alone. So he left with the two youngest, who by now were in the car with Sara. ‘If they’d been big enough to resist physically maybe they’d still be with me too. But by law none of the children should be with me. ‘The Spanish court order says they should all be in Spain with their father because in 2009 a Spanish court ruled they should be there because, in the judge’s words at the time, they are deemed to be habitually resident in Spain. Desperate: A letter from Jessica, Jennifer's daughter, begging a judge to let her stay . ‘I will fight to my dying breath to keep them here with me and to get my youngest two children back, too. ‘Sara will always be welcome as well, but she is almost an adult now and she has made her choices.’ Following the collapse of their  12-year marriage in 2008, her ex-husband won custody in his native country of all five children in a legal process Miss Jones describes as ‘highly questionable’. Last October, as the deadline for handing over her children loomed, Miss Jones received calls from the police every half an hour. ‘I kept telling them I didn’t want them to be taken before I’d got home to say goodbye to them. ‘To be fair, the police were extremely understanding and were not putting me under any added pressure. After my conversation with the policeman a few days earlier, we all went home and I sat the kids down on the settee and I said to them, “OK children, it stops here, I promise. You are not going back to Spain. You are safe now.” ‘Their faces immediately broke out into huge smiles and they started cheering.’ She claims the children have all testified, in written and verbal statements to lawyers and court officials over the years, to wanting to remain with her, but to this day the orders granting Mr Palacin Cambra custody of all five stand. Mr Palacin Cambra categorically denies his ex-wife’s claims of ever mistreating her or any of his children physically or psychologically. ‘It’s incredibly complex legally,’ said Ms Jones. Heartbroken: Miss Jones says that she will fight to her 'dying day' to keep her children . ‘I believe I have suffered a grievous miscarriage of justice but it is costing me everything I have, financially and emotionally, to have it overturned. ‘Because the order was granted on Spanish soil, it is almost impossible to have it overruled in the UK. ‘I have to fight it in Spain, but the moment I set foot there I am worried the children’s father will pull another legal order out of the hat. ‘I dare not return to Spain for this reason at present but moves are under way to appeal the original custody orders. But it is expensive. I’ve spent £40,000, my mother has remortgaged her house and John [her partner] has handed over every penny that he’s earned.’ Her blue-green eyes well with tears as she speaks. Dark circles beneath them speak of the sleepless nights and strain she has endured. ‘Sometimes I just lie in bed in the small hours sobbing my heart out because it’s all got too much for me. I miss my youngest two children so much,’ she says. For now, she has to make do with occasional phone calls to or from the children. She says she has a ‘standing arrangement’ that she can call their father’s mobile at 8pm any day to speak with them, but, she says, the phone is rarely switched on at  that time. ‘I am certain David and Eva are too terrified to phone me,’ she says . ‘The last time I spoke to any of them was on May 23 when her father had miraculously left the phone on so I could wish her happy birthday. Since then, nothing. ‘I try calling every night and so do Jessica and Tomas. It is so hard for them, too. ‘I know Eva in particular will be finding it so hard to cope because she only used to be able to fall asleep if she was holding Jessica’s hand. It hurts so much to think about it. ‘All I know is that I will never give up on them. Never.’","Jennifer Jones, 47, from Carmarthenshire went on the run with her children .

A thief who was just 17 when he murdered a bed-ridden dementia sufferer as he burgled her flat has been jailed for a minimum of 18 years. Margery Gilbey, 88, was found covered in blood at her sheltered accommodation in Shadwell, East London, after convicted thief Imran Douglas ransacked her room and left her to die. He strangled the 'old-fashioned East Ender' and stabbed her in the neck in a crime described by a judge as 'wholly gratuitous'. Thug: Imran Douglas, left, was just 17 when he murdered 'old-fashioned East Ender' Margery Gilbey, 88, right, at her home in Shadwell, East London. The Old Bailey heard he left her to die in her bed, covered in blood . The Old Bailey heard Douglas, who had been expelled from six schools and put in a children's home just six days earlier, went to Mrs Gilbey's flat on May 24 with the intention of killing her. After fatally wounding her, Douglas rummaged through her drawers with blood on his hands. When a nurse looked through the letterbox and saw him in the room, Douglas clambered over the balcony and escaped in a car waiting nearby. Mrs Gilbey's son Alan, 55, from nearby Bethnal Green, visited with her favourite fish and chip supper just as staff were raising the alarm. Together he and the care assistants found his mother already dead in her bed, covered in blood. Known as Madge, the well-known former cafe cook had nursing care at the first-floor flat because she had dementia and difficulty walking on her own. In the last few years she had been almost entirely confined to her bed. In an emotional tribute, her son said she the 'kindest most gentle person' who was liked by everyone she met. The Sonali Gardens sheltered flats in Shadwell, East London, where Mrs Gilbey was murdered on May 24 . He added: 'I can’t believe what has happened. 'She was a wonderful person and mother. She was very straightforward and kind - she had old-fashioned East End values. 'Everywhere she lived she was well-liked. The staff at the sheltered accommodation loved her and they have no blame for what happened. Now I just need to mourn. All this is just sinking in.' He was not at court, saying it would have been too traumatic to look his mother's killer in the eye. Douglas even made a reconnaissance trip to the flat the day before the murder, the court heard. He . conned his way into the building pretending to be the grandson of a . resident, then returned to his children's home in Bow, East London. The next day he gained access in the same way and headed straight to Mrs Gilbey's flat. Detectives identified him on CCTV and went to the children's home the same day. There they found his clothes covered in blood in a laundry basket, and a bag on his bed which had the pensioner’s blood on it. Douglas . initially denied murder, but changed his plea to guilty on the first . day of his trial when faced with overwhelming evidence. 'Although I would clearly love to attend sentencing to see justice done for my mother, I cannot,' he said. 'If I were to see Imran Douglas in person, it would make him real to me. 'He would haunt me and I know those momentary flashes would be unbearable.' Douglas, who turned 18 last month, had previously been granted anonymity because of his age. He stared at the floor while he was sentenced, and as he was led away a family member of Mrs Gilbey shouted: 'I hope you rot, scum'. The court heard social services failed to heed warnings from Douglas's own father that he was a danger. Judge John Bevan QC told him: 'Clearly you have significant problems controlling your anger, and it is a tragedy that social services totally failed to have regard to the reality of the extreme danger you posed in May this year and will continue to pose in the future. 'It is in my judgement, and sadly, a crime at the top end of the scale of gravity. 'You used a knife to attack a defenceless and vulnerable old lady in the privacy of her own home, on premises you must have seen to be sheltered accommodation. 'You could have burgled her to her heart's content without doing what you did. 'It seems you were observed being driven away in a car but you lack the courage to name your accomplice. 'You rooted through her property after stabbing her, leaving her blood on her wardrobe. 'It was wholly gratuitous and, I fear, callous.' The court heard Douglas still faces two outstanding charges of carrying a knife. Detective Chief Inspector Graeme Gwyn said: 'Margery was killed as she lay in her own bed, in a place where she should have been safe. To see such violence used against a defenceless, elderly lady was truly shocking. 'Only Douglas can explain why an attempted burglary had to end in murder. 'I would like to pay testimony to Margery's family who have demonstrated incredible dignity throughout this difficult process.'","Imran Douglas was 17 when he killed retired cafe cook Margery Gilbey .

Ed Miliband wants to ban payday loan firms from screening cartoon-like commercials during children's television programmes. The Labour leader has threatened to outlaw the ads during the shows if negotiations with the advertising watchdog fail. He also wants the firms stopped from plugging their expensive loans with cartoon characters such as Payday Pig, Beeloans and CashCowNow. Mr Miliband said young viewers were being used as a tool by the payday loan industry and added: 'Kids shouldn't be given the impression payday lending offers easy money without consequences.' His comments came after consumer champion Martin Lewis of MoneySavingExpert warned that payday lenders were 'grooming' youngsters by exposing them to adverts on short-term loans. Mr Miliband said he worried when 'pay day lenders target our kids and young people'. 'How else do we explain hundreds of thousands of pounds being spent by payday lenders for adverts during children's TV programmes. And why else are they using cartoon characters, trendy puppets or cute plasticine figures in some of their ads?' he said. Advertising was rubbing off on youngsters: a survey found one in seven parents were told to take out a payday loan by their children when they refused to buy them something. Mr Miliband called for payday loan firms to be treated the same as junk food or gambling ventures - which are banned by the Advertising Standards Authority from running ads during children's programmes. The next Labour government will ask the watchdog to ban irresponsible advertising of the loans - which charge rates of up to 6,000 per cent a year - that targets youngsters. 'If this cannot be done through the advertising watchdog, we will do it through legislation,' he said. Mr Miliband also criticised the payday lender Wonga for launching a glossy film last week which painted the firm as 'a cross between an essential public service and a fairy godmother'. Seven out of ten people who took out the supposedly short term loans regretted it, Mr Miliband said. Labour has said it would cap the total cost of credit of payday loans - going further than the coalition government which has ruled out a limit on the interest rates charged. Scroll down for video . Child appeal: This character is used to advertise Payday Pig loans . Targeting kids: Ed Miliband argued that cartoon characters such as CashCowNow, left, and the monkey mascot for cheekypayday.co.uk, were targeting parents through their children . Not for kids: Wonga has long used non-threatening puppet characters to advertise its loans . Local communities would also be given more powers to halt the growth of payday lenders and betting shops on the high street. Mr . Lewis welcomed the move. 'We've been calling for a ban on payday loans . on children's TV. The risk is they effectively groom a new generation of . children, normalising, legitimising and mainstreaming this dangerous . type of niche borrowing,' he told the Sun on Sunday. 'Marketing is at the core of these loans, which cause many people pain and misery. 'They're . slick, fast, efficient technological plays, the crack cocaine of . lending that have created a market that didn't really exist five years . ago - and sadly our lack of regulation means they thrive here while . other countries have far more effective controls.' A survey of parents conducted by . MoneySavingExpert.com found that 30 per cent of children under 10 were . repeating advertising slogans from payday loan ads. A . spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said . the government was already cracking down on irresponsible payday . lenders to protect consumers. She said: 'Two misleading payday loan adverts have been banned over the past six months as part of our work with the Advertising Standards Authority. 'New rules will also force payday loan adverts to include risk warnings and information about where the public can access free and confidential debt advice. 'New powers have been introduced to ban products, impose unlimited fines and order firms to refund consumers. 'These new restrictions build on the action taken by the Office of Fair Trading which has seen 25 payday lenders leave the market since March.' The Consumer Finance Association, which represents the payday industry, denied children were being targeted. Its chief executive, Russell Hamblin-Boome said: 'Martin Lewis's suggestion that responsible, legal businesses are advertising to children is absurd. CFA members do not target any specific group of people - certainly not children.' The industry is under investigation by the Competition Commission.","Labour leader said he would ban the cutesy adverts if he wins next election .

The Unite union, led by Len McCluskey (pictured), was again Labour's biggest donor, contributing £772,195 between April and June . Ed Miliband's growing dependence on Labour’s union paymasters was laid bare yesterday as it was revealed that the barons are providing 77 per cent of the party’s funding. Figures released by the Electoral Commission watchdog revealed that the Unite union, led by far-Left firebrand Len McCluskey, was again Labour’s biggest donor, contributing £772,195 between April and June. In total, the unions gave Labour more than £2.4million in the second quarter, out of a total of just over £3million, which included lump sums of £485,830 from the GMB and £458,080 from Unison. Labour’s reliance on union cash is particularly stark since the figures also show that Labour is in a staggering amount of debt, with outstanding loans of £12.8million, compared with £2.6million for the Tories. The party was forced to increase its overdraft facilities by £2.4million earlier this year with the troubled Co-operative Bank. Among the Conservative Party donations was a controversial £117,300 from Offshore Group Newcastle Limited, an oil and gas company promoting offshore windfarms. In May last year the company’s subsidiary OGN North Sea won a £640,000 contract from the Department of Energy and Climate Change to build the foundations for offshore wind farms. The Tories topped the donations list and raked in a little over £4million in the same period, compared with £801,000 for the Liberal Democrats. But in another sign of the shifting sands in British politics, donations to the UK Independence Party doubled between the first and second quarters of the year from £74,000 to £153,000. That included £50,000 from businessman Guy Brook and regular donations from long-time supporter Stuart Wheeler, the spread betting magnate. The Lib Dems released figures showing that when union donations are disregarded they have raised more money from ordinary donors than Labour has. They also claimed to have more than 1,000 individual donors, three times the number who gave to Labour.

The Ministry of Sound gave the Lib . Dems donations totalling £65,000 just weeks before the nightclub’s boss . James Palumbo accepted a peerage. The company made a donation of . £50,000 to the central party on June 6, and on June 30 a further £15,000 . was given to the Bermondsey and Old Southwark local association of Lib . Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes. It takes the amount the company has . given to the party to £698,000. On August 1, it was announced that Mr . Palumbo had been elevated to the House of Lords – nominated by Lib Dem . leader Nick Clegg. News of the donation was pounced on by Labour last . night as an example of the Lib Dems’ hypocrisy. Karl Turner MP said: ‘Nick Clegg pledged before the election to “take the big money out of politics”. Now we know he meant he wanted to put his biggest donors in the House of Lords.’ Last night a spokesman for the Lib . Dems said: ‘James Palumbo is a long-time supporter and donor. It should . surprise no one that he continues to support the Liberal Democrats’ aims.’ Conservative . Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Despite Ed Miliband’s promise of . change, these independent figures prove his Labour Party is still . dominated by the trade unions. They choose the candidates, pick the . leader and remain Labour’s biggest donors, providing three-quarters of . the party’s money. ‘Until Ed Miliband stops taking his union paymasters’ cash, he will be too weak to stand up for hard-working people. Instead, he can only offer what the union barons want in return for their money: the same old Labour policy of more spending, more borrowing and more debt, exactly what got us into this mess in the first place.’ The largest donations to the Conservatives were £280,770 and £263,600 respectively from party co-treasurers Michael Farmer, a hedge fund manager, and James Lupton, an investment banker. Labour released figures showing the Tories had been given £1million from donors who attended private dinners with David Cameron and other senior ministers. They included hedge fund managers David Harding, who gave £100,000, and Neil Ostrer, who gave £50,000. Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: ‘The Tories have raked in over £1million from private dinners with David Cameron and senior ministers in the last quarter. And more than two thirds of that comes from the City – the bankers and hedge fund bosses whose taxes David Cameron cut.’ A Labour spokesman insisted the party was not as dependent on the unions as the figures suggest, since they record only donations of more than £7,500.","Unite union contributed £772,195 to Labour between April and June .

Legal woes: Alyza Rachel Russell, 22, was hit with a slew of charges, including two counts of DUI manslaughter, after police say she struck and killed two men while driving her mother's Porsche . A 22-year-old woman from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has been arrested and charged with DUI manslaughter after police say she struck and killed two pedestrians with a Porsche. Alyza Rachel Russell was taken into custody Wednesday nearly three weeks after the deadly accident that killed 30-year-old Mackendy Jules and 35-year-old Samuel Artez Martindale in a parking lot in downtown Fort Lauderdale. Investigators say Russell was driving her mother's cherry red 2012 Porsche Panamera west on Broward Boulevard at around 2.15am on June 13 when she lost control of the vehicle while trying to make a left turn on Southwest Fifth Street. The sports car jumped the curb, plowed through some bushes and careened through the parking lot, mowing down Jules and Martindale. Jules was struck while sitting on the curb, while Martindale was hit as he stood next to his bicycle, Miami Herald reported. Eyewitnesses say Russell's Porsche ended up dragging Martindale’s body on the ground before the vehicle came to a stop. Jules was pronounced dead on the scene, while his companion died later that day at Broward General Medical Center, according to the Sun-Sentinel. Another person who was hanging out with Jules and Martindale that night was able to escape the out-of-control vehicle unharmed. Russell and her two passengers also were not injured. Innocent bystanders: Samuel Artez Martindale (left), 35, and Mackendy Jules (right), were killed June 13 in a Fort Lauderdale parking lot after being struck by Russell . Ride: Russell was behind the wheel of her mother's cherry red 2012 Porsche Panamera at the time of the accident . Out of control: Police say the driver was trying to make a left turn when the car jumped the curb, plowed through a hedge (pictured) and barreled through a parking lot . Police officers who arrived on the scene had Russell submit blood samples for testing. A toxicology report later revealed that her blood alcohol level was 0.17 - more than twice the legal limit in Florida. Russell turned herself in to custody at 7am today and was charged with two counts of DUI manslaughter, two counts of unlawful blood alcohol level manslaughter, one count of DUI property damage and one count of unlawful blood level property damages. The driver was ordered held at Broward County Main Jail on $450,000 bond. During Russell's bond hearing, it was revealed that the woman allegedly told a co-worker after the fatal crash that she was planning to flee to Ireland to escape prosecution. Aftermath: Martindale was standing next to his bicycle when he was struck by Russell's car, which ended up dragging him through the parking lot . Deadly consequences: Jules was pronounced dead on the scene, while his companion passed away in a hospital later that same day . Under the influence: A toxicology report showed that Russell's blood alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit when she got behind the wheel of the luxury car . Her attorney, however, denied the allegations, claiming that his client's family had been planning to go on a vacation abroad, CBS Miami reported. This is not Russell's first run-in with the law. Records show that she entered a no contest plea in January for a charge of driving without a valid license and without lights. The case stemmed from a June 2012 traffic stop when Russell was behind the wheel of a 2009 Porsche. Dark past: Russell (left) pleaded no contest to driving without a valid license in connection to a 2012 incident that involved a 2009 Porsche . The Miami Herald reported that before her Facebook page was deleted in the days after the accident, it listed Russell as a student of international relations at American University in Washington D.C. until 2011. She graduated from Leysin American School in Switzerland in 2009. NBC Miami reported that the 22-year-old woman has dual citizenship from the U.S. and U.K. Russell's LinkedIn profile states that the woman works as a design assistant at Interiors by Steven G.","Alyza Rachel Russell had blood alcohol level more than twice the legal limit .

Less than a week after British street artist Banksy's painting of a Nazi officer into a landscape of a mountain lake sold for $615,000, the buyer backed out. The winning bidder, who went by the online name of 'gorpetri,' failed to make good on the deal, which led New York City Housing Works thrift shop desperate for another taker. The original painting featuring a serene landscape was purchased from Housing Works a few months ago. It was then returned with the addition of a Nazi officer sitting on a bench, taking in the scene with Banksy's signature in the corner. After discovering the artist behind . their latest acquisition, the thrift shop, which benefits the homeless . and those suffering from HIV/AIDs, decided to sell the painting,'The Banality of the Banality of Evil,' at . an auction. Less than a week after British street artist Banksy's painting of a Nazi officer into a landscape of a mountain lake sold for $615,000, the buyer backed out. Bidding started off at $74,000 but sold way above that at $615,00 to 'gorpetri,' who then was unable to come up with the funds to pay his winning bid. Housing Works immediately went in search of another taker. According to Gawker the thrift store contacted the next highest bidder, who refused to pay a . bid that had been placed in competition with a fraud.' Other bidders wondered if 'gorpetri' was actually the elusive British graffiti artist playing another prank to drive up prices. They also started to complain that Housing Works was not telling the truth about how the painting made it's way to their store. People gather outside the Housing Works Thrift Shop on 23rd Street in New York City to get a glimpse of Banksy's painting - 'The Banality of the Banality of Evil.' Wil Emlingman, from Minneapolis who bid on behalf of a private buyer, told TPM that he is suspicious of Housing Works. 'They were in on it all along. They knew. Actually, Banksy's people actually contacted them saying, 'Hey, we're looking for a landscape piece, we want to paint a monster on it,' Emling said. 'So the whole story about somebody buying it weeks ago and then somebody coming and dropping it off and telling them, 'I need to speak with the manager, you have a very expensive piece on your hands here,' isn't the case.' But Housing Works and Banksy's PR team deny all of the claims. A spokesperson from Housing Works said that they had no idea who the man was when he dropped off the 'vandalized' painting last month. 'I don't know all the details, it was all done very secretively. But someone came in and dropped it off as an anonymous donation,' Housing Work's Rebecca Edmondson told The New York Post. The thrift store was able to eventually find a buyer. They sold the painting to an anonymous individual who paid 'at least $450,000,' according to Gawker. Before the auction, Housing Works hung the painting in their store on 23rd Street. Bidding started off at $74,000 but sold way above that at $615,00 to 'gorpetri,' who then was unable to come up with the funds to pay his winning bid. 'It was one of the largest gifts Housing Works has ever received and we're thrilled,' Housing Work's chief development officer, Matthew Bernardo, told TPM. 'We're thankful that he chose us as an emblem of New York to give his donation to.' The charity donation marked the conclusion of the British artist's self-imposed 'residency' in New York, where he debuted a new piece of art every day during the month of October. Banksy ended his month-long residency on the streets of New York with an inflatable tag on the Long Island Expressway in Queens. The last piece from Better Out Than In sits above other tags in a used car lot. Cops took down the balloons. One exception was made on October 23 when he posted on his website that the day's art had 'been cancelled due to 'police activity'. The philanthropic turn came after he penned an op-ed slamming the 'Freedom Tower' design that is replacing The World Trade Center. His critique- where he called the building a 'shyscrapper'- landed him in hot water with New Yorkers.","Less than a week after British street .

Copiague, Long Island, damaged the machinery that makes the company's . biggest seller - The Original Coney Island Square Knish, which also . come filled with kasha or spinach. Delis, diners, food carts and grocery stores have been short on the snack since the six-week-long shortage began, but lovers of the square, fried, doughy pillows of pureed potatoes may not have to go without much longer. This photo shows Gabila Food Products's Coney Island square knishs . The factory promises an end to the knish crunch by Thanksgiving, which coincides with the start of Hanukkah. 'Our customers... are calling us saying they are literally searching supermarkets and stores and they're all asking when we'll be back,' Stacey Ziskin Gabay, one of the owners of the 92-year-old Gabila's Knishes, which sells about 15 million knishes a year. Gabila's, which also makes matzoh balls, blintzes and latkas, sells the knishes both online and at retail outlets around the country, with New York, Florida and California leading the sales. 'For the last month I haven't had any knishes — my heart is broken,' said Carol Anfuso, a native New Yorker who has been without a knish to nosh since the BJ's Wholesale store near her Atlanta home suddenly stopped stocking them. But Anfuso didn't learn of the shortage until she visited her sister for lunch at the Pastrami King restaurant in Merrick, Long Island, and found that it was out of stock, too. A food cart in midtown Manhattan in New York sports signs offering square potato-filled Jewish snacks . Pastrami King owner Joe Yamali said he normally sells about 2,000 knishes a month. 'It brings you back to your childhood and they're just so delicious,' Yamali said. 'Gabila is square and fried. You bite into it and the potato oozes out. It's very good.' Katz's Delicatessen, the 125-year-old landmark on Manhattan's Lower East Side, ordinarily sells about 6,000 knishes a month. 'I usually get four to take home,' grumbled Brooklyn native Forrest Gurl. 'Their crunchiness, their hard corners, the mustard and sauerkraut you put on them. You can't beat a knish.' Like most places, the round, baked version is still available. But Gurl harrumphed a familiar sentiment of knish devotees: 'Who gets round knishes?' Jesse Hochberg, a retired IT employee, didn't know there was a shortage until he got to the Katz's counter. 'I miss them,' he said. 'It's something I grew up with. I like the taste, sliced with mustard. ... I always look for them, and I haven't seen them recently.' Katz's chef Kenny Kohn has grown weary of explaining the shortage to customers. Along with the pastrami sandwiches, he serves up a typical New York attitude to the ongoing complaints. 'Get over it!

He added: 'When you have to go to the bar, you have to break that conversation mid-flow. With this, the conversation doesn't stop.'

Greenland has voted to allow the mining of uranium, other radioactive materials, and rare earth metals. The decision is sure to attract interest from China which currently exports 90 per cent of the world's 'rare earths' (file picture) Greenland's parliament has lifted a ban on mining radioactive materials including uranium in the hope that it will raise funds for the nation's stagnant economy. The new law will also allow the mining of 'rare earths', uncommon materials used in many modern technologies such as smartphones and hybrid cars. The move is sure to attract the attention of China which currently produces around 90 per cent of the world's rare earth metals. Investors from Australian-owned Greenland Minerals and Energy think they . may have found one rare earth deposit which could be the largest . outside of China, and has estimated it could extract up to 40,000 tons . of metals per year. Quoted by local newspaper Sermitsiaq, Greenland Prime Minister Aleqa Hammond said: 'We cannot live with unemployment and cost of living increases while our economy is at a standstill. 'It is therefore necessary that we eliminate zero tolerance towards uranium now.' Hammond's government won the vote by 15-14 votes and now hope that mining income can be used to win financial independence. While Greenland is self-governing the island is still officially part of the Kingdom on Denmark, and rely on their old colonial masters for a cash subsidy which makes up two-thirds of the island's economy. One Australian-owned firm says it is exploring a rare earth deposit which could be the largest ever found outside of China (file picture) The former colonial ruler also has a say in security and defence issues and any decision to sell uranium may need to be approved by the Danish parliament - possibly putting the two nations on a diplomatic collision course. Denmark's Minister . for Trade and European affairs, Nick Haekkerup, said: 'Concrete actions on the mining and export of uranium will potentially . have far-reaching implications for foreign, defence and security . policies and are as such a matter for the Kingdom.' Greenland's 'zero tolerance' policy on mining . radioactive materials is inherited from Denmark, but the island is keen . to develop mining to help pay for welfare and jobs in this country with . a population of around 57,000 people, mostly Inuits. Since Greenland won self-government in 2009, most politicians have aimed for growing autonomy and eventual independence. Environmental campaigners have warned that mining in Greenland could upset the pristine Arctic ecosystem . 'I think the Danish government is prepared for the no-tolerance to be lifted' said Cindy Vestergaard, senior researcher at Danish Institute for International Studies. 'After that the Greenlanders and the Danes are going to start hammering all the legal aspects. We will not be mining on Friday, nor next year, or 2015.' However, the possibility of uranium mining has been criticised by environmental . groups which warn that . uranium mining in Greenland could threaten the Arctic region's pristine . ecological system. Separately, iron ore producer London Mining said on Thursday it had received the go-ahead from the Greenland government for a 15 million tonne a year mine in the country, paving the way to attract partners for the project. The Isua project which will cost an estimated £1.4billion ($2.3 billion) has been controversial in Greenland over fears that it will attract a flood of Chinese workers into the country.","Greenland lifts cap on mining radioactive and 'rare earth' materials .

A young cancer victim told she was infertile after having more than 300 hours of chemotherapy is finally enjoying motherhood after the birth of her ""miracle"" baby. Madeleine Telfer, 21, lost two-and-a-half stone in weight after battling Hodgkin's Lymphoma TWICE in 18 months. She was devastated when doctors warned her that the constant chemotherapy had probably left her infertile and she would never have children.  But less than a year later she was stunned to discover she had fallen pregnant with partner Stephen Batey, 27, who she met during her treatment. Madeleine Telfer with her partner Stephen Datey and her miracle baby boy Harris who was born on November 27, 2011 . Now the couple are celebrating the birth of their ""miracle"" baby Harris, who is two months old. Madeleine, who is now trying for her second child, said: 'All I ever wanted was a family. It's something I've dreamed of since I was a wee girl. 'And when the doctors told me I would be infertile I was distraught. 'Of course, losing your fertility is a small price to pay to save your life, but I was devastated. 'When I found out I was expecting Harris, I don't think I've ever been so happy.' In August 2008 Madeleine was a normal teenager studying child care when she began to feel ill. Her glands swelled up and she lost two and a half stone in just a few weeks. Her worried parents Robin, 52, and Careen, 49, took their daughter to Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock, Scotland, where a biopsy revealed she had cancer. Madeleine, 21, never thought she would be able to have children . From January 2009 she underwent a four-hour chemotherapy session every two weeks for six months, notching up 48 hours of treatment. Madeline said: 'I was in my bedroom when my mum came in. She sat down, very calm, very composed. 'She said I had Hodgkin's Lymphoma. I had cancer. 'I had a lurching feeling in my stomach. It didn't make sense, it didn't feel real. It was overwhelming. 'I was a very lively, bubbly person but during treatment I felt rotten for months. I had no energy but my family and friends were really supportive.' The treatment made Madeleine so weak she caught pneumonia but despite her illness she was given to news that her treatment had been successful in August 2009 and her cancer had gone into remission. Life returned to normal, Madeleine began to see friends and got a job in the clothing store TK Maxx. But on January 12, 2010, Madeleine's world came crashing down for a second time when she received the news a routine CT scan had shown the cancer had returned. She was rushed into 'salvage chemotherapy' and endured three gruelling 90 hour sessions in isolation - a further 270 hours. It was during her recovery in the weeks following her treatment that Madeline met her partner Stephen, a postman, while having a quiet drink with friends. Madeleine, who lives in Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, said: 'My friends wanted to take me out as a treat. 'I had been in isolation for a long time during my treatment so we went a drink in Kilmarnock and Stephen was there. 'I had a wig on because I lost my hair, I told him my story and it went from there.' Following the treatment Madeleine was transferred to the Beatson Cancer Centre in Glasgow to replace stem cells destroyed during her treatment. Madeleine's brother Gary, now 24, and Carleen, 26, were tested and her sister proved a perfect match. But just weeks before the operation Carleen fell pregnant and couldn't donate.

'I was happy for my sister because she had been trying for a baby for a while, but I was devastated that it meant she couldn't donate.' Madeleine was given the all clear at the beginning of May 2010. She added: 'I was over the moon, I was just so happy. 'It also meant that stem cells that I had removed during my treatment, which we were saving, could be put back into me.' Madeleine returned home and enjoyed Christmas with her family.Her dreams came true in March last year when she found out she was pregnant, something she had given up hope on two years earlier. Madeleine was over the moon and gave birth to baby Harris on November 27 last year after just a three hour labour. She said: 'I couldn't believe it I did about five tests to make sure. 'Life is now just fantastic. I couldn't be happier. He is a little miracle. 'I have come through a lot and as a result I am a completely different person. 'We would love Harris to be joined by a wee brother or sister but I appreciate every I have. Everything is wonderful.'

For expectant parents, whether or not to test their unborn child for Down’s syndrome can be an agonising decision. Routine scans at ten and 13 weeks can flag up a heightened risk of the condition, which causes lifelong disability and a host of complex health problems. But a definitive diagnosis can be given only after amniocentesis, an invasive procedure that draws amniotic fluid from around the baby with a needle and syringe – and brings with it a risk of miscarriage. Now, Carolyn and Neil Blockley, who are expecting twins, have become one of the first couples in the UK to benefit from a controversial blood test that can accurately identify Down’s and eliminate the danger of the traditional method. More than 98 per cent accurate for twins and 99 per cent accurate for a single baby, the new non-invasive Ariosa Harmony test – one of a number of similar tests – requires no more than a blood sample drawn from the pregnant woman’s arm. However, disability campaigners believe that if such a test were to become widely available, it would increase terminations of Down’s babies – nine in ten women given the news choose to have an abortion. At present, mothers to be are given a combined test for the syndrome at the end of the first trimester. It comprises an ultrasound known as a Nuchal Translucency (NT) scan, which measures the fluid behind the baby’s neck, a larger amount of which can indicate Down’s, and a blood test, which looks for hormones and proteins related to the syndrome. The two results are combined to give a risk rating. If the risk is high, then women are offered amniocentesis. Because these hormones and proteins are already higher in a multiple pregnancy, women expecting twins have only the NT scan – which is 80 per cent accurate. The combined test is 90 per cent accurate at best. It was after the NT scan that doctors . first alerted the Blockleys to potential problems. Carolyn, 29, an . accountant, from Pentre, Mid Glamorgan, explains: ‘They said there was . more fluid than was usual around one baby’s neck. Light of our lives: Hayley Goleniowska, 43, whose daughter Natty, right, was born with Down's Syndrome . 'We were shocked when the doctor told us he thought it could be Down’s syndrome. It was very upsetting as these are our first babies and I hadn’t had any problems before.’ With amniocentesis, performed from 15 weeks, there is a one in 100 chance of miscarriage – and with twins this risk is doubled. Carolyn says: ‘Had I not had the new test, I would have faced a terrible dilemma about whether or not to have an amniocentesis. Although we would have wanted to know our babies were healthy, the thought we could risk losing them was devastating.’ Thankfully for Carolyn, her consultant suggested having the Ariosa test, which has been available privately since May. She chose the screening at 12 weeks, and ten days later the results showed her babies were healthy. Now 17 weeks pregnant, she says: ‘It was a huge relief to be given the all-clear. I’m looking forward to enjoying the rest of my pregnancy without worry.’ The couple’s doctor, Dr Bryan Beattie, a consultant in foetal medicine at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, wants the NHS to provide the test as a routine screening. ‘Every year hundreds of healthy babies are miscarried during amniocentesis,’ says Dr Beattie. ‘The NHS shouldn’t be delaying this test. Instead, it should be making it standard practice. New test: The Ariosa Harmony test requires no more than a blood sample drawn from a pregnant woman¿s arm . ‘Far fewer mums to be will then need to have an amniocentesis and it will therefore save precious lives.’ Of the 750,000 women in Britain who become pregnant each year, 30,000 are offered amniocentesis to test a potential problem. But 41 per cent of those women decide not to have the test – or any other screenings available on the NHS. The new procedure identifies what is known as cell-free DNA (cfDNA), tiny fragments of foetal genetic material circulating in the mother’s blood. As well as Down’s syndrome, this DNA can be tested for other chromosomal conditions such as Edwards and Patau syndromes, both of which cause severe brain abnormalities and heart defects and mean babies rarely live beyond a year. Down’s syndrome is one of the most common genetic causes of learning disability, and about 750 babies are born with the condition each year in the UK. It is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 in a baby’s cells, the reasons for which are still unknown. The age at which a woman becomes pregnant is the only clear factor identified as increasing the likelihood of having a baby with Down’s. A woman of 25 has a risk of one in 1,250. This risk increases to one in 400 for women of 35, and one in 100 for women of 40. By the time a woman is 45, there is a one in 30 chance. Yet critics argue the new test – being trialled for the NHS at King’s College Hospital, London and Medway Maritime Hospital, Kent – will mean women are railroaded into having an abortion. Hayley Goleniowska, 43, from Padstow, Cornwall, whose second daughter Natty, six, was born with Down’s, runs website Down’s Side Up to help educate people about the condition. ‘If a test is routinely offered – rather than given as a choice – it is ultimately being recommended. When the test is positive, most women are then offered an immediate termination – very few are asked if they would like to meet a family with a child with Down’s or even told another option truly is to keep their baby.’ Hayley, whose elder daughter Mia is nine, adds: ‘My husband Bob and I had no idea we were having a baby with Down’s and, devastatingly, doctors said Natty might not walk or  even talk. ‘But she’s at mainstream school and is the light of our lives.’","New non-invasive test for Down's eliminates risk for miscarriage .

Overweight, badly dressed and with fragile mental health, operatic singer Jonathan Antoine was vulnerable when he stepped on to the stage at Britain’s Got Talent last year. As he faced  the judgment of Simon Cowell – and millions of viewers – there were fears he would endure the same  fate as Susan Boyle, who suffered  a breakdown after the pressures  of the show. But instead, the 20st teenager overcame his demons and began to blossom. His depression lifted and he now credits the show with rescuing him from suicide. Road to recovery: Since finding fame, Jonathan Antoine, pictured with singing partner Charlotte, has lost 4st in weight and battled back from depression . Since he and singing partner Charlotte Jaconelli came second in the talent contest, his mental and physical health have been transformed. ‘Britain’s Got Talent pretty much saved my life,’ says Jonathan, 18. ‘Before then I was suicidal  and so depressed that I was self-harming. ‘I’d dropped out of sixth form and my parents wouldn’t leave me alone at home as they thought I’d try to take my own life. I felt so low it is almost impossible to describe. It was like I had nothing to live for –  it was the darkest period of my life. ‘But everything changed from the moment I went on the show. I was elated. Suddenly everything seemed different. When you’re depressed, it’s impossible to see a way out, but I now had a purpose.’ Jonathan’s problems began when he started being bullied at school. ‘I’ve been overweight for as long  as I can remember and I stood out because of my size,’ he recalls. ‘Kids can be really horrible and they would pick on me about my weight. It really damaged my confidence, and while I tried not to let it show, I think that led to my depression. Being bullied just sucks the life out of you.’ Life-changing moment: Jonathan and Charlotte as they auditioned for Britain's Got Talent - where they eventually ended up in second place in the finals . By the time Jonathan was 14, his low self-esteem had escalated into depression. ‘I shut myself off from the world and lived in my own head,’ he says. ‘I’ve always felt different from everyone else and I felt cut off and excluded. I didn’t tell anyone how I felt – I just kept pushing it down inside me.’ But suppressing his distress only deepened the condition. In 2010, Jonathan began self-harming. ‘I’d cut the skin on my arms and stomach as I hated myself and was angry at myself for even existing. It was also a way of making the emotional pain a physical pain, which seemed somehow easier to deal with.’ Things grew even worse in 2011 when he moved to a new private school to study for A-levels and was suddenly thrown into a new social mix, with a heavier workload and longer days. By November that year, the stress became so much that Jonathan suffered a nervous breakdown. ‘Everything just overwhelmed me,’ he says. ‘I felt more out of place than ever and was under pressure  to be something different. ‘People there kept telling me to cut off my hair and change how I looked. I think that’s what pushed me to that darkest point where I couldn’t cope with anything any longer. ‘There were times I was so low I tried to end it. I never ended up in hospital but had deep cuts and my self-harming intensified. I was cutting myself almost every night as a form of release, almost to remind myself that I really existed.’ He dropped out of school and confessed his problems to his parents. ‘It was only then, after all those years, that I ended up spilling out all my thoughts and feelings – the first time I had openly come out as depressed,’ admits Jonathan. ‘My parents were amazing. They helped me through it and once they knew I was suicidal, they never left me home alone.’ They also took him to Loxford Hall psychiatric unit in Ilford, Essex, where he began seeing a psychiatrist, who also prescribed the antidepressant Prozac. ‘I saw a few different psychiatrists, then found one I clicked with. At first I was in such a state I couldn’t even form sentences as the emotions were so strong, but after  a while I felt able to speak about everything. He got me immediately and we just talked.’ Dynamic duo: Music has put Jonathan on a healthier path and he is due to release his second album with Charlotte later this month . As Jonathan was battling through the bleakest period of his life, his best friend Charlotte, 18, asked him to audition with her for Britain’s Got Talent. The pair had been inseparable at West Hatch High School in Chigwell, Essex, since being put together to sing in music class aged 14. Charlotte had applied for the TV talent show before they left secondary school and had only just heard back from the producers. Yet rather than Jonathan’s depression proving a barrier to appearing on TV, it had the opposite effect. ‘By then I had given up caring about anything, so I had no reason to turn it down,’ he says. ‘My parents thought I shouldn’t do it as I was in such a bad place but I was so low I had nothing to lose.’ It proved to be a life-changing decision. ‘From the first moment we stepped out in front of Simon and the crowds, it didn’t feel real. We were both numb with nerves, but when we started singing and the crowd started cheering it was like this warmth filled up inside me.’ Their song – a cover of Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli’s duet The Prayer – wowed the judges and the duo stormed through the heats to reach the BGT final, where they were runners-up to performing dog act Ashleigh and Pudsey. Jonathan and Charlotte soon recorded their first album, Together, for Simon Cowell’s label Syco, and  it reached No 5 in the British charts. Their second, Perhaps Love, for Sony Music will be released on October 14. But in the middle of all that, rather than shrinking under the pressure of fame and public exposure, Jonathan found himself. ‘When I got on the show, the more information that  I let out about me, the real me, gradually it actually helped me cope with my own depression. For the first time  I had to face it head-on and couldn’t just hide away in my room as I had when I dropped out of school. ‘I felt overwhelmed and initially  it was terrifying. Being in front of the camera, especially as I’ve always been self-conscious, was horrifying. But you do get used to it and oddly enough, it turned into a sort of therapy for me. ‘I haven’t had any serious episodes of depression since I’ve been on the show. When I get the thoughts that once brought me to such a horrible place, I just tell myself that they don’t matter. ‘I stopped therapy eight months ago as my psychiatrist and I discussed it and decided it was time to stop, though he’s still there for support if I need him. I’m still on Prozac but will come off it eventually.’ Jonathan has also dropped from 20st to 16st. ‘I signed up with  WeightWatchers last year, but I didn’t take it seriously until this April – now I’ve lost 4st. ‘I never felt pressure to lose weight from people in the music industry but I wanted to do it for myself. I feel much better within myself and will keep going. ‘I don’t have an ideal size in mind – I just want to be healthy.’ He adds: ‘I look back now at my depression and ask myself what I was doing – there’s no need to hurt yourself or feel so sad. ‘Things really can get better. My story is proof of that.’","Britain's Got Talent runner up suffered from severe depression .

Gravity pulling down the skin of the scalp is to blame for baldness, an expert has claimed . From poor genes to hormone problems, there are many reasons why a man can go bald. And now one expert has come up with a somewhat novel theory - gravity. Dr Emin Tuncay Ustuner, a plastic surgeon in Ankara, Turkey, believes gravity pulling down the skin of the scalp is to blame. The vast majority of men suffer from male pattern baldness and Dr Ustuner believes his theory is 'unparallelled' in its ability to explain this type of hair loss. The answer, he says, is the weight of the scalp on the hair follicles. In . younger men, the scalp has sufficient fat tissue under the skin, and it . is 'capable of keeping itself well-hydrated,' taking the pressure off . the hair follicles. But as a man ages, the skin and underlying fat become thinner, and the pressure on the hair follicles increases. Declining levels of the male sex hormone testosterone contribute to thinning of this fat, Dr Ustuner explained. As . the amount of cushioning fat decreases, the hair follicle has to work . harder against all the pressure - and needs more of the hormone for . normal growth. To respond to this, a potent form of the male sex hormone testosterone, called dihydrotestosterone (DHT), builds up in the scalp. The hair growth cycle accelerates in . response to DHT, but it's not enough to overcome the increased pressure.

Now research shows one in ten Britons are so stressed they are close to breaking point. The study, 10,000 people, found that 44 per cent are stressed - and that 27 per cent of these people believe they are often close to breaking point. One in ten Britons are so stressed they are close to breaking point - 44 per cent of British adults say they are stressed and 27 per cent of these stressed people say they are often close to breaking point . The survey, conducted by Bupa, also showed that stress is a chronic problem with 28 per cent of stressed respondents saying they have been stressed for more than a year. Stress levels are not equal across the age groups – 45 to 54-year-olds are the most likely to be stressed and the over 55s are the least likely to be stressed. The survey revealed that 50 per cent of 45 to 54-year-olds are stressed, compared to 38 per cent of over 55s. Bupa’s findings also revealed that women are more likely to consider themselves stressed than men are – 49 per cent of women say they are suffering from stress compared to 39 per cent of men. Dr Martin Baggaley, medical director at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, said:‘This research shows stress is extremely common in this country. The main cause of stress is money worries, following by work, family life and living with a long term illness . ‘While low-level and irregular bouts of stress can be beneficial and manageable, it’s concerning to see that so many people are experiencing sustained and relentless stress. ‘If left unchecked for a prolonged period of time, stress can cause much more serious, long-term mental and physical illnesses such as anxiety and depression, and be a contributing factor in health problems such as heart disease and even obesity.’ The study found that the main cause of stress is money worries, following by work, family life and living with a long term illness. It also revealed that people in the Midlands are more likely to be stressed than people anywhere else in the country - in the Midlands, 46 per cent of people say they are stressed. The Welsh are the least stressed – 40 per cent say they are suffering symptoms of the condition. Worryingly, 30 per cent of men, and 22 per cent of women, say they increase the amount of alcohol they consume to help them deal with stress and 61 per cent of people say they would only seek help if they were no longer able to cope with daily life. Dr Baggaley said: ‘There is a growing problem of long-term stress in this country, which needs to be addressed. ‘It’s important that people realise that stress is not just something that you have to put up with. ‘If you recognise that you are under unusual pressure, try self-help techniques – for example deep breathing, taking exercise and avoiding unhealthy behaviours – these can all make a real difference and help you to feel back in control. ‘If self-help isn’t having an effect, or if you’re concerned about your stress levels or feeling very anxious, you should always talk to your GP or a healthcare professional.’","Almost half of British adults believe they are currently suffering from stress .

A drink driver who crashed his sports car into the side of a house, narrowly missing a sleeping child, has been banned from the road for two years. Lewis Richardson, 22, lost control of his red Audi TT while trying to find his girlfriend after an argument during a night out. The salesman crashed through a hedge and fencing before his car ricocheted off the top of two parked cars and crashed through a house in Carlton Colville near Lowestoft, Suffolk. Drink driver Lewis Richardson, 22, lost control of his red Audi TT, crashed into the side of a house, narrowly missing a sleeping child . The car wedged in the living room wall and window of the home, suspended four feet above the ground and just below a bedroom where a five-year-old girl was sleeping. Richardson of Pakefield near Lowestoft, suffered serious head injuries in the crash in March and had to be carefully cut from the wreckage by firefighters. He was left fighting for life and was treated for several weeks in a specialist head injuries unit at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge. Lowestoft magistrates heard how the university graduate still had limited movement and difficulties with his speech and vision and suffered from extreme anxiety, depression and guilt. A blood test revealed he had 87 mgs of alcohol in 100 mls of blood, just over the legal limit of 80 mgs. Richardson admitted drink-driving and driving without due care and attention. As well as being banned, he was fined £650 and ordered to pay £125 costs. Presiding magistrate Mike Cadman said Richardson’s ban was double what it should have been because of the 'consequences' of the crash. The salesman crashed through a hedge and fencing before his car ricocheted off the top of two parked cars and crashed through a house in Carlton Colville near Lowestoft, Suffolk . The car wedged in the living room wall and window of the home, suspended four feet above the ground and just below a bedroom where a five-year-old girl was sleeping . The court heard how the car caused serious structural damage to the detached house and could only be removed by engineers after it had been embedded for eight hours. The family of three in the house had to be moved into rented accommodation while repairs were made, said prosecutor Tess Mann. She added that the daughter was so traumatised that she refused to sleep in a room on her own. Debbie Reynolds, defending Richardson, described him as of previous good character and said he was 'extremely sorry' and had visited the family to apologise. She said: 'If he could wind back the clock so it never happened he would.' Ms Reynolds added in a statement after the hearing: 'He is truly sorry he made a mistake to drive on that evening.' The family of three in the house had to be moved into rented accommodation while repairs were made . Keith Shales, 66, who lives near the crash scene, said: 'When I got there and saw the car through the hole in the hedge I thought ‘That looks serious’. 'I’ve seen photos of cars going into people’s houses before but from the pavement, through the bushes and the cars behind it - it was like a launch pad - it must have been for him to get that high. Richardson’s parents, Graham and Ann, wrote to a local paper after the crash to praise 999 workers who saved his life. The couple said: 'We would like to thank all the members of the emergency services who attended. 'We would also like to thank the A&E department at the James Paget University Hospital and Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge for saving our son’s life.

Charged: Anthony Piazza, 71, faces three charges that could put him in prison for 10 years . A 71-year-old Iranian-born Canadian has been charged with endangering Montreal's Trudeau International Airport after security screeners allegedly found bomb-making components in luggage he was attempting to carry aboard a plane bound for Los Angeles. Anthony Piazza was charged Monday with mischief, endangering the safety of an aircraft or airport and being in illegal possession of an explosive substance. The incident partly shut down Montreal's main airport for several hours on Sunday and caused a neighborhood to be shut down for a police search. Police found wires, bullets, and a powder inside the bag, his attorney, Louis Morena, said. Authorities say the components were not assembled into a bomb, but could be used to make one. Piazza, who is originally from Tehran, changed his name in the 1980s from the Iranian Houshang Nazemi to the Italian moniker Anthony Piazza, said Morena. He previously served a 10-year-sentence under that name in Canadian prison for smuggling drugs into the country. Morena told reporters Piazza maintains his innocence in the airport case and that the carry-on bag didn't belong to him. 'He said somebody gave the baggage to him,' Morena said. Prosecutor Alexandre Gauthier said Piazza could face up to 10 years in prison and that the investigation is ongoing. He didn't rule out the possibility of additional charges. 'There may be more serious accusations, but it's hard to tell what's going to come out of the investigation right now,' Gauthier said. Flights were delayed for several hours at Trudeau International Airport as a result of the bomb scare . Piazza, a stocky man with a clean-shaven face, wore a black suit and dress shirt in his brief appearance at the Montreal courthouse. He addressed the court in English. Piazza is set to appear again Tuesday for a bail hearing. Police said they searched the suspect's apartment and car in a residential area near the airport Sunday evening after the package was spotted earlier in the day. They seized some documents but Ian Lafreniere, a Montreal police spokesman, said they have found 'nothing obvious' so far. Anthony Piazza, sketched in court in Monday, changed his name from his Iranian moniker to a an Italian name following an arrest in the 1980s for drug trafficking . Members of the city's SWAT team were called in and authorities set up a security perimeter spanning several city blocks during the search. About 20 residents were temporarily evacuated from their homes. The package was spotted at a security checkpoint in the U.S. departures area early Sunday morning. Lafreniere describe the seized items as 'different parts of a potential device.' 'To make that a little clearer, let's say you are trying to do a bomb inside the luggage, but one thing was missing: no explosives, but it was different parts of a dangerous device,' Lafreniere said. Piazza was detained, everyone on the flight was questioned, and luggage was searched as a precaution, Lafreniere said. Flights destined for the United States were delayed for several hours on Sunday morning but an airport spokeswoman said flight operations had resumed by early in the afternoon.

An emaciated pit bull described by humane society officials in Louisiana as the worst case of abuse they’d ever seen has staged an amazing turnaround in just two weeks. Vets at Jefferson Parish Animal Shelter feared for the 3-year-old pup, named Athena, when she arrived on Oct. 15. Then Athena was on the brink of death, too weak to lift her head and weighing just 25lbs - less than half the body weight of a healthy dog her age. Scroll down for video . Pit bull Athena has gained 14lbs since she was taken into care and adopted by Joana Castay, right . Heart-rending sight: Athena, a 3-year-old pit bull, came to the Jefferson SPCA weighing only 25lbs, with all her bones clearly visible through her skin . ‘I thought she was dead. I couldn't even believe she was breathing,’ shelter director Robin Beaulieu told Nola.com. ‘I'm surely no stranger to cruelty, but I'd never seen a dog in her condition.’ She committed to paying all the medical bills for the animal if a home could be found for the dog who has been named after the Greek goddess of wisdom. Later that day, the dog was transferred to Metairie Small Animal Hospital, where veterinary assistant Joana Castay saw her and decided to adopt her. The sweet-faced pit bull has made a startling recovery in the ensuing two weeks and while still too thin, the dog is back on her feet and thriving with the attention she is receiving. A little over two weeks ago vets didn't think that Athena would make it as she was barely alive - extremely malnourished and dehydrated, infested with hookworms and heartworms . Skin and bones: Athena was so emaciated and riddled with ailments that she could not even lift her head . The positive changes in Athena is . attributed to ‘food, love and deworming’ by Castay. At first, Athena was fed chicken and canned dog food, which she could only manage in small portions. ‘It . was definitely a workout for her to eat,’ Castay told Nola.com. ‘She . would eat a little, take a break for 30 minutes or an hour, and then eat . some more.’ Athena . spends her days at the hospital, but every night goes home with Castay . and has integrated well with other two dogs - Beans and Carley. ‘I . can't believe how easily she has looked to us for safety and love after . her trust in people was broken,’ said Cathay. ‘She just seems so . grateful.’ Athena . is a little weary of men and still hides when Castay's boyfriend comes . to visit, although he is more friendly with her cat Voodoo. Foster mom: Veterinary technician Joana Castay decided to bring Athena inot her home for the duration of her recovery . Horrific neglect: Athena suffered from anemia and dehydration, an infection in her uterus, as well as heartworms and hook worms . Since being rescued, Athena gained almost a pound a day and by Thursday her weigh was up to 39 pounds, 11 ounces. ‘She eats three times a day, and now she eats all her food in one sitting,’ said Castay. Athena . still has to overcome a very severe case of heartworms, but needs to . get stronger and gain another 10 or 15 pounds before the treatment can . start. It will then take three months to complete, said Castay.

For the first time ever the contraceptive pill has become as popular as condoms among teenagers aged under 15, according to new figures. A greater number of young teenage girls are choosing to protect themselves from pregnancy by using oral contraception. It comes as experts warn it is vital youngsters continue to use condoms, to prevent against sexually transmitted infections. Last year around 6,600 girls under the age of 15, or 39 per cent of those who attended NHS contraceptive clinics, listed the pill as their contraceptive method of choice. That compared with 6,900 youngsters or 40 per cent, who used condoms. The report, compiled by the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), revealed a wide variation in the decisions made by teenagers regarding contraception across the UK. The use of oral contraceptives has risen in recent years and was already more popular among older teenagers and adults. But the figures mark the first time the pill has caught up with condoms among the under-15 age group. In 2011-12, condoms were recorded as the primary contraception method used by 46 per cent of young teenagers who attended the clinics, compared with 36 per cent who used the pill. Jason Warriner, clinical director at sexual health charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, called for regular STI screenings to be brought in across the UK when contraception is prescribed. He told MailOnline: 'The good thing is young teenagers are accessing contraception services, going on the pill or getting something like the implant. 'But it is vital to make sure when they start on a form of contraception they are offered an STI screening at the same time and are given advice about using condoms in addition to their chosen form of contraception. 'It is about using condoms to reduce the risk of STIs and HIV. The key message is for people to regularly get tested, when they change partners and ensuring their partners are tested as well. 'I would like to see every woman who is on the pill offered STI screening each time they receive a repeat prescription, every three to six months. 'For girls under 15, they fall within the national chlamydia screening programme, but that only tests for one infection. 'The key message is about prevention, using condoms to prevent getting an infection and building that around your contraceptive needs.' The study, carried out by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, shows oral contraception is the most common first choice in all age groups . The report, published yesterday, . showed a decline in the total number of people who visited NHS . contraceptive clinics - an eight per cent fall in the number of . attendances and five per cent drop in the number of individuals . visiting. Experts said the drop indicates a shift towards people getting contraception over the counter in pharmacies, or from their GP. Paul Eastwood, who compiled the HSCIC report, said the data used only refers to those people visiting NHS community contraception clinics. He added it is vital to remember contraception is also available over the counter at pharmacies and at GP practices. The study also exposed variations in the decisions made by people in different parts of the UK, regarding their choice of contraception. In the West Midlands and Yorkshire, one in four women opted to use condoms, while in the south west the figure was one in seven. Experts have warned using the pill does not protect against sexually transmitted infections, advising people use condoms as well . The pill was favoured in more than half of all attendances at clinics across the south and east of England but was less popular among women in northern regions. The research showed that less traditional forms of contraception, including impants and injections - classed as long acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) - are becoming more popular, with almost one in three of women requesting the longer-acting alternatives. More than two in five women in the north east preferred LARCs, compared to just over one in five women in the West Midlands. Genevieve Edwards, of Marie Stopes International, welcomed the rising number of people using the pill but urged young people to remember it does not prevent STIs. She told the Telegraph: 'Young people should also remember however that the Pill only protects against pregnancy, and does not protect you from sexually transmitted infections.' A Department of Health spokesman said: 'Teenage pregnancies are at their lowest level for 40years. 'A minority of under 16s are sexually active, and it is important that they get good advice about contraception and preventing STIs.' In total there were 2.3million attendances at clinics across the UK last year, 194,000 or eight per cent fewer when compared with the previous year when 2.5million attendances were recorded. The contraceptive pill does not protect against sexually transmitted infections . The pill contains synthetic versions of the female hormones oestrogen and progesterone. The hormones prevent a woman's ovaries from releasing an egg. When taken correctly NHS Choices says the pill is 99 per cent effective at preventing pregnancy. It can help ease heavy or painful periods.Minor side effects include mood swings, breast tenderness and headaches. There is a low risk of serious side effects including blood clots and cervical cancer. The pill does not protect against sexually transmitted infections. Experts said a condom should be used alongside the pill to protect against a wide range of curable and incurable diseases, including HIV.","Condoms essential in protecting against STIs and HIV say experts .

Halloween turned into a nightmare for some parts of the country as severe thunderstorms are blamed for the deaths of three people in Texas and Tennessee. Storms blanketed much of the U.S. Thursday night - from southeastern Texas, through the Midwest and as far north as Maine. In central Texas, near Austin, two people drowned as heavy rains in the drought-plagued region caused flash floods that swept away unsuspecting victims. Hundreds more people had to flee their homes. In Tennessee, a 9-year-old boy was struck and killed by a downed power line cause by heavy winds. Heavy rains near Austin led to flash-flooding in the drought-stricken area that resulted in some residents having to be evacuated from their homes . Several feet of water socked in some low-lying communities in central Texas . Firefighters waded into flooded neighborhoods to rescue stranded residents Thursday night . Officials in parts of at least four states in the path of the storm - Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee - said they decided to put off the customary practice of children in costumes going from house to house collecting candy. The Tennessean newspaper reports that strong winds knocked down tree limbs - which cut power to some 15,000 homes in the area. A 9-year-old boy accidentally touched one of the downed power lines and was electrocuted, according to the newspaper. Trick-or-treating was not canceled in that city, thought it is unknown whether that was why the boy was out. In Austin, Texas, police report that the body of a man 50 to 60 years old was found Thursday in the city's flooded Onion Creek. The Caldwell County sheriff's office reported earlier that a man died Thursday after driving on a low-lying portion of road overtaken by flooding. The man was swept out of his vehicle in Dale, south of Austin. On its way: A map shows how storms could dampen celebrations from Texas all the way to the Northeast .

Authorities said the decision to cancel trick-or-treating in some areas was prudent, considering the storms rolling through much of the Eastern U.S. 'I think it's a good idea,' said Tara Dudzik, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Indianapolis. 'Winds of up to 60 miles per hour, and lightning - those are the main threats we'd be concerned about.' Low pressure with a trailing cold front is pushing turbulent weather from the Gulf states north through the Mississippi Valley and toward the Great Lakes, said Myron Badgett, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Wilmington, Ohio. The cities of Indianapolis and Muncie, Indiana, postponed trick-or-treating, local officials said. Toledo and at least 30 cities in Central Ohio put it off until Friday or as late as Sunday, according to the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission's website.

Crievewood Baptist Church in Nashville, Tennessee, said it canceled a 'Halloween Break Station' that was planning to offer parents and children hot dogs, chips, water and games along trick-or-treating routes. The decision was made because so few children were expected to be out, it said. Indianapolis has long required registered sex offenders, who are barred from having contact with children, to attend a meeting during trick-or-treat hours on Halloween night. That meeting has been rescheduled for Friday. But Halloween was still on in Cincinnati, which according to a local television station, has not delayed or canceled trick-or-treating in two decades because of snow or thunderstorms.

It was therefore almost inevitable that a worker would be badly burned in a fire. 'The company had the right equipment to do the job properly but instead it allowed workers to stand in a pit surrounded by fuel vapours where just one spark from electric equipment could start a fire. 'If the fuel had been removed in a well-ventilated area, or even outside, without any ignition sources nearby then the severe burns Lee suffered could have been avoided.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 23:06 EST, 31 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 23:07 EST, 31 October 2013 . A former Indiana State Trooper who was acquitted last month of the murders of his wife and two children has spoken out publicly for the first time since the September 2000 slaying that shocked his small community. David Camm thanked his supporters with a letter he posted on the Facebook group dedicated to clearing him of the murder charges. 'My heart is overflowing with love for each and every one of you. The sacrifices, dedication and emotional investment that you willing express in both words and action for little ole insignificant me is hard to wrap my head around,' he wrote. Tragedy: Kimberly Camm, 35 (right), her son, Bradley, age 7 (left), and daughter Jill (center), age 5, were discovered shot dead in the garage of their home in September 2000 . Camm's first public words in more than 13 years come as it is revealed cash-strapped Floyd County, Indiana, spent an estimated $4.5million on three trials for Camm - a legal process that ultimately saw him walk free. On October 24, jurors cleared Camm over the deaths of 35-year-old Kimberly and their children, Brad, 7, and Jill, 5, who were found shot dead at their home on September 2000. He was convicted of their murder in 2002 and again in 2006 - though both convictions were overturned on appeal. The third trial, which took place this year and drew jurors from a town 100 miles away from Camm's home in New Albany, resulted in acquittal. Camm said he felt betrayed by his friends at the State Police and the prosecutors office who pursed charges against him. 'On one hand I had the State of Indiana represented by people I thought were my friends, people who I thought cared for me trying to take my life from away as well as trying to deny justice for Kim, Brad and Jill,' he wrote. 'On the other hand there are all of you. Over the last thirteen years I have seen the worst in people and thanks to all of you I have seen the best.' Free man: David Camm leaves court today after 13 years and three trials accusing him of murdering his family . Cleared: David Camm, pictured in August, thanked a jury after they found him not guilty of his family's murder . Camm left the state police several months before the slayings, which were investigated by his former colleagues. Camm has said he was playing basketball at a church at the time of the slayings. Camm wrote that he was not ready to discuss the loss of his family. 'I am choosing to move forward. I don't want to be consumed by the past. They, the State, are not going to take more from me than they have already have gotten. My focus is the future,' Camm wrote. He thanked God for the turn in his fortunes. 'I am a blessed man,' he wrote. The letter was posted in the 'Free David Camm' Facebook group by his uncle, Sam Lockhart. It was signed, 'The Camm Family: David, Kim, Brad and Jill.' Nick Stein, an attorney for Kim Camm's parents, Frank and Janice Renn, had no immediate comment on the letter. The Renns are suing David Camm to try to prevent him from recovering an estimated $625,000 in life insurance and 401(k) funds. NBC News reports that local officials estimate the three trials for Camm - including appeals - cost about $4.5million. That's a sizable bill for Floyd County, which is currently facing a $2.9million budget gap and considering laying off employees. 'I don't know how we're going to do it without raising taxes or laying off employees,' County Councilwoman Dana Fendley told the Louisville Courier-Journal.

A tunnel designed to smuggle drugs from Tijuana, Mexico to San Diego was equipped with lighting, ventilation and an electric rail system, U.S. authorities said Thursday, making it one of the most sophisticated secret passages discovered along the U.S.-Mexico border. Authorities seized eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 327lb of cocaine in connection with the tunnel's discovery, according to court records. Three men who authorities say worked as drivers were charged Thursday with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute. U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy said they face prison sentences between 10 years and life if convicted. Scroll down for video . Deeper underground: The tunnel linking warehouses in Tijuana and San Diego is equipped with electricity, ventilation and a rail system . Smuggling: Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the passage, near Tijuana airport, had been recently completed . The tunnel, which zigzags the length of . nearly six football fields, links warehouses in Tijuana and San Diego's . Otay Mesa industrial area. The area is filled with nondescript . warehouses, making it easier to conceal trucks being loaded with drugs. The tunnel was shut down Wednesday night, before any drugs made it through undetected, authorities said. Federal agents had the San Diego warehouse under surveillance after being tipped off by an informant who told them that operators bought drills and other construction equipment in August and September. As U.S. border security has heightened on land, Mexican drug cartels have turned to ultralight aircraft, small fishing boats and tunnels. More than 75 underground passages have been discovered along the border since 2008, designed largely to smuggle marijuana. The tunnels are concentrated along the border in California and Arizona. San Diego is popular because its clay-like soil is easy to dig. In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers tap into vast underground drainage canals. The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006, a period during which Mexico's Sinaloa cartel has solidified its hold on the prized smuggling corridor. Authorities said Wednesday's tunnel was the first in the San Diego area that was found to be used for cocaine. Haul: Authorities seized more than eight tons of marijuana and 325lb of cocaine in connection with the discovery . Small: Last year, a 240-yard drug-smuggling tunnel was unearthed in Arizona (pictured here) The entrance measured 24 inches by 24 inches and it dropped down 60ft into a 240-yard tunnel . The passage was about 35 feet underground, four feet high and three feet wide, said Derek Benner, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's head of Homeland Security Investigations in San Diego. Authorities said the zigzag route suggests that excavators veered off course several times. Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after central Mexico's marijuana harvest in October, which presents drug cartels with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers. In November 2011, authorities found a 600-yard tunnel that resulted in seizures of 32 tons of marijuana on both sides of the border, with 26 tons found on the U.S. side, accounting for one of the largest pot busts in U.S. history. The tunnel was equipped with electric rail cars, lighting and ventilation. Wooden planks lined the floor. Buried: Homeland Security Investigations officers examine drugs on October 31, 2013. The drugs were taken from a tunnel linking warehouses in San Diego's Otay Mesa industrial park and Tijuana, Mexico . On Thanksgiving Day 2010, authorities found a roughly 700-yard passage equipped with rail tracks that extended from the kitchen of a Tijuana home to two San Diego warehouses, netting about 22 tons of marijuana on both sides of the border. Seizures linked to the tunnel include a haul of three tons of marijuana in a truck that was stopped by Chula Vista police on Saturday for a traffic violation and five-and-a-half tons of marijuana inside the tunnel, a nearby warehouse and a truck Wednesday, according to prosecutors. The cocaine was found in six suitcases inside a van seen leaving the warehouse Wednesday. It takes between six months and a year to build a tunnel, authorities say. Workers use shovels and pickaxes to slowly dig through the soil, sleeping in buildings where the tunnels begin until the job is done. Sometimes they use pneumatic tools. Underworld: United State Attorney for the Southern District of California Laura Duffy talks about the investigation leading to 1760-foot cross-border tunnel used for drug smuggling in San Diego . A total of 156 secret tunnels have been found along the border since 1990, but the vast majority were incomplete. Raids last November on two tunnels linking San Diego and Tijuana netted a combined 52 tons of marijuana on both sides of the border. In early December 2009, authorities found an incomplete tunnel that stretched nearly 900 feet into San Diego from Tijuana, equipped with an elevator at the Mexican entrance. This tunnel was said to have cost more than $1.5 million to build.","Tunnel connects Mexican city of Tijuana with San Diego, California .

An armed mob set out into the Florida Everglades on Saturday to flush out a scaly invader. It sounds like the second act of a sci-fi horror flick but, really, it's pretty much Florida's plan for dealing with an infestation of Burmese pythons that are eating their way through a fragile ecosystem. Nearly 800 people signed up for the month-long 'Python Challenge' that started Saturday afternoon. The vast majority - 749 - are members of the general public who lack the permits usually required to harvest pythons on public lands. Scroll down for video . Invader: The Burmese python is shown off at the start of the event. Around 800 people have signed up to hunt the snake during the 2013 Python Challenge . Fighting back: Hunters Christopher Padgett (left) and Matthew Manus (right) from Sebring, Florida, leave their campsite in the Big Cypress National Preserve for a five-day python hunt . 'We feel like anybody can get out in the Everglades and figure out how to try and find these things,' said Nick Wiley, executive director of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. 'It's very safe, getting out in the Everglades. People do it all the time.' Twenty-eight python permit holders also joined the hunt at various locations in the Everglades. The state is offering cash prizes to whoever brings in the longest python and whoever bags the most pythons by the time the competition ends at midnight Feb. 10. Dozens of would-be python hunters showed up for some last-minute training in snake handling Saturday morning at the University of Florida Fort Lauderdale Research and Education Center in Davie. Captain Jeff Fobb, of Miami-Dade Fire Rescue's Venom One unit, displays a python during the kick-off ceremonies in Davie, Florida, on Saturday. This 13-foot snake was captured a year ago swimming in a backyard pool . Signing up: Hundreds of participants volunteered for the hunting event that began on Saturday . On the trail: Dan Keenan (right) and Steffani Burd (left) head into the Everglades in the search of pythons . The training came down to common sense: Drink water, wear sunscreen, don't get bitten by anything and don't shoot anyone. Many of the onlookers dressed in camouflage, though they probably didn't have to worry about spooking the snakes. They would have a much harder time spotting the splotchy, tan pythons in the long green grasses and woody brush of the Everglades. 'It's advantage-snake,' mechanical engineer Dan Keenan concluded after slashing his way through a quarter-mile of scratchy sawgrass, dried leaves and woody overgrowth near a campsite in the Big Cypress National Preserve, which is about 50 miles southeast of Naples and is supervised by the National Park Service. Keenan, of Merritt Island, and friend Steffani Burd of Melbourne, a statistician in computer security, holstered large knives and pistols on their hips, so they'd be ready for any python that crossed their path. The snakes can grow to more than 20 feet in length. Dan Keenan battles through thick brush in search for Burmese pythons, also described as the 'zombies of the Everglades' Captain Jeff Fobb explains the problem to the media with the help of an 85-pound python . The most useful tool they had, though, was the key fob to their car. Burd wanted to know that they hadn't wandered too far into the wilderness, so Keenan clicked the fob until a reassuring beep from their car chirped softly through the brush. The recommended method for killing pythons is the same for killing zombies: a gunshot to the brain, or decapitation to reduce the threat. (The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals doesn't approve of the latter method, though.) Pythons are kind of the zombies of the Everglades, though their infestation is less deadly to humans. The snakes have no natural predators, they can eat anything in their way, they can reproduce in large numbers and they don't belong here. Ready for combat: Dan Keenan is prepared with a knife should encounter a python. But he told media the situation is 'advantage-snake' Florida currently prohibits possession or sale of the pythons for use as pets, and federal law bans the importation and interstate sale of the species. Wildlife experts say pythons are just the tip of the invasive species iceberg. Florida is home to more exotic species of amphibians and reptiles than anywhere else in the world, said John Hayes, dean of research for the University of Florida's Institute for Food and Agricultural Sciences. Roughly 2,050 pythons have been harvested in Florida since 2000, according to the conservation commission. It's unknown exactly how many are slithering through the wetlands. Officials hope the competition will help rid the Everglades of the invaders while raising awareness about the risks that exotic species pose to Florida's native wildlife. Keenan and Burd emerged from the Everglades empty-handed Saturday, but they planned to return Sunday, hoping for cooler temperatures that would drive heat-seeking snakes into sunny patches along roads and levees. Burd still deemed the hunt a success. 'For me, I take back to my friends and community that there is a beautiful environment out here. It's opening the picture from just the python issue to the issue of how do we protect our environment,' she said. Careful lookout: Another hunter, BR Slocum, uses a golf cart as he searches for snakes with his son .","Hundreds sign up to find Burmese pythons in the Florida Everglades during month-long competition .

Boris Johnson’s hopes of becoming Prime Minister have received a major boost after former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd hailed him as ‘the new Disraeli’. A new book by the Conservative grandee mocks the way ‘every Tory leader’ – and Ed Miliband – since Disraeli has tried to associate themselves with the Victorian Prime Minister’s ‘One Nation’ brand of politics. But he argues that the only one who can lay claim to be a modern Disraeli is Mr Johnson. While the London Mayor may be delighted by the comparison, Lord Hurd’s comments are double-edged. Parallels: Benjamin Disraeli and Boris Johnson have a number of similarities, according to Lord Hurd . He says Disraeli’s greatness derives not from political achievements or principles, but from character and wit. Furthermore, writes Lord Hurd, Mr Johnston shares Disraeli’s reputation for ‘wicked’ behaviour with women and telling the truth. ‘According to accepted wisdom on modern politics, Boris Johnson should have been ruined years ago. He has been accused of all kinds of conventional wickedness, including being unfaithful and insulting the people of Liverpool. And yet his reputation has soared. Argument: The former Foreign Secretary believes that Mr Johnson can capture Disraeli's appeal . ‘Boris gets away with it because he is entertaining and makes good use of his education. Of course, there is a question of control. While Disraeli tried to keep his comedy in check and did not let his wit gallop away with him, Boris allows himself to be consumed by his own jokes. This makes it difficult when he wants to make a serious point.’ However, he concludes: ‘But, one way or another, Boris has nonetheless done today what Disraeli did in the 19th Century, namely raise the level of interest in politics up several pegs.’ Lord Hurd’s book, Disraeli: Or The Two Lives, studies how Queen Victoria’s favourite Prime Minister established a permanent hold on the Conservative Party despite being a ‘bankrupt Jewish school dropout and trashy novelist’. He writes: ‘He held few principles which he was not ready to alter for the sake of immediate tactical gain. ‘Moreover, in Disraeli’s personal life, the negative side of the ledger is piled particularly high. He married for money after abandoning women who adored him. ‘If Disraeli were alive today he would despair at the lack of courage and bravery among our political classes. These days we are subjected to parliamentary performances that border on banal.’ Mr Johnston is ‘the most prominent exception who proves the rule’, says Lord Hurd.",Douglas Hurd says London mayor can channel Disraeli's popular charm .

If you can think back to the days before YouTube was even invented and the dawn of high speed internet, you may recall an amusing video that got sent around called 'Star Wars Kid'. Ghyslain Raza recorded himself imitating a Jedi from the “Star Wars” films. The then 14-year-old’s awkward display captivated the internet’s attention causing the clip to become one of YouTube’s earliest viral hits. While the video was a runaway success, the teenage became a target for both online and offline bullies. Ten years on since the video did the rounds, Ghyslain Raza, the 14-year-old boy in the clip is speaking out about how it changed his life. Scroll down for video... Ghyslain Raza, 14: He used his high school¿s TV studio in November 2002 to film a two-minute clip in which he clumsily impersonated a light saber-wielding Jedi Knight with the help of a golf ball retriever . Life-changing: While the video was a runaway success, the teenager soon became a target for both online and offline bullies . Although the video came out in 2003, it was in the days before cellphones took decent quality video. Raza never intended for the clip to spread in quite the way it did. He put a VHS tape into his school's video camera, grabbed a golf ball retriever, and pressed record. Classmates found the tape and uploaded it online. And so a new celebrity was born: Star Wars Kid. It brought a type of fame and celebrity that Raza did not want. 'What I saw was mean. It was violent,' the Trois-Rivières native, now 25, tells L’actualité 'People were telling me to commit suicide.' Speaking up: Now a law-school graduate, Raza decided to speak out about his experience following a spate of high-profile cyber bullying which have led to suicide. Wishes: Raza says he hopes speaking out about his experiences will help the victims of cyberbullying and unfortunate memes . The bullying got so bad that Raza was forced to quit school and ended up checking into a psychiatric ward with severe depression. 'No matter how hard I tried to ignore people telling me to commit suicide, I couldn’t help but feel worthless, like my life wasn’t worth living,' he said. Front page: Ghyslain Raza, 24, one of the first people to gain notoriety from a viral video, is the subject of a cover story for Canadas two major news magazines this week. He has talking about what it is like to be cyber-bullied . He tells L'Actualite how the whole thing started: 'I made the video in November 2002, when I was a member of the school's television club. I'd been working on a Star Wars parody with other students for a gala. One evening, while I was alone in the studio, I practiced the choreography...Most 14-year-old boys would do something similar in that situation, maybe more graceful, but I was goofing around. I left the tape on a shelf in the studio. I didn't think about hiding it. Who would take the trouble to watch it?' He says that everything rapidly degenerated. In the common room, students climbed onto tabletops to insult him and people made fun of hie weight and appearance. He was given the label 'Star Wars Kid'. 'They didn't mean it as a compliment,' he says, 'It soon became impossible for me to attend classes.' He tried to do something about the bullying. His dad called the school but the principal and teachers didn't understand and the police said there was nothing they could do. Raza sat his exams in a psychiatric unit of a hospital. In the end, he and his dad decided to sue the school for not taking care of him and the media too in the hope that they would stop showing the video. Raza maintains, the money he received did not even cover expenses. Although he was invited onto talk shows, he did not believe it was for the right reasons. Raza felt he was being portrayed as a laughing stock, a circus act rather than for doing something truly worthwhile. He described the experience to the Canadian magazine as humiliating. Despite all of his misgivings about the past, Raza says he wouldn't change a thing. 'Today I'm happy with who I am...I'm the product of good and bad experiences. Obviously, if you were to tell me that it would happen again, I wouldn't greet the news with overwhelming joy and happiness. But I wouldn't look for ways to avoid it.' He eventually came out the other side of his depression and went to University to study law. Now he's decided to speak out about the past to help other young people who are cyber-bullied. 'You’ll survive. You’ll get through it,' Raza assures, 'And you’re not alone. You are surrounded by people who love you.'","Ghyslain Raza filmed himself awkwardly fooling around with a pretend Star Wars light sabre in .

His speech in Sydney broke his support for the government . Australia should throw open its doors to immigrants to make the country more competitive, media mogul Rupert Murdoch has said. In contrast to his backing for the new government's tough policy on asylum seekers, Mr Murdoch said immigration would help the country become more competitive. The diversity created by immigration, and the ties it brings with other nations, particularly in Asia, would help give Australia a leg-up as it seeks trade relationships, the head of News Corp explained. 'Australia is on its way to becoming . what may be the world's most diverse nation,' Mr Murdoch said in a . speech to the Lowy Institute think tank in Sydney. 'This is an . incredible political advantage.' Mr Murdoch compared Australia with . the United States, which he said was being 'racked by self-defeating . debate over immigration policy'. The steady flow of refugee boats is a . hot political issue in Australia, polarising voters, while stoking . tension with neighbours like Indonesia and Sri Lanka. The new conservative, Liberal-led . coalition government came to power partly on the back of a tough . campaign against asylum seekers, following a relaxation of border . policies by the former Labor government that resulted in a rise in the . number of boats. But its hardline border security policies have been criticised by the United Nations. News Corp's media outlets in Australia were staunch supporters of Prime Minister Tony Abbott, with his best-selling Daily Telegraph tabloid urging readers to 'Kick This Mob Out' over a photo of former Labor leader Kevin Rudd.

Hundreds of peace campaigners gathered outside an RAF base today to protest against the 'obscenity' of armed drones being used to conduct unmanned missions in Afghanistan. About 400 demonstrators took part in a march from Lincoln to a rally at nearby RAF Waddington, which assumed control of British drone missions in Afghanistan earlier this week. The Ministry of Defence confirmed on Thursday an oversight of armed intelligence and surveillance flights by drones deployed to Afghanistan had now moved to Waddington from a United States Air Force facility in Nevada. Vocal: Hundreds of protesters took part in a march to RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire, which started flying armed drones over Afghanistan this week . Adamant: But despite assurances over their use from the MoD, protesters insist they are unethical . Clear message: Members of the Stop The War Coalition, CND, The Drone Campaign Network and War on Want all took part in the rally . Protesters taking part in today's rally cheered calls for the international community to emulate action taken against cluster munitions by outlawing armed drones. Chris Cole, a co-ordinator of the Drone Campaign Network, said the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to wage war raised numerous legal, ethical and moral issues. Speaking near Waddington's perimeter fence, Mr Cole told the Press Association: 'This is the new home of drone warfare in the UK and there are questions about the growing use of these armed, unmanned systems. Not here: The RAF began remotely operating its Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles in Afghanistan from the Lincolnshire airbase earlier this week, to the dismay of residents . 'Because of their remote nature, there is no risk to any of our forces and that makes it easier to launch weapons and makes it much easier for politicians to get involved in warfare.' Mr Cole said the number of demonstrators present at the rally showed the strength of public feeling against the use of drones, particularly to target areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan. The activist added: 'In Pakistan there are reliable reports of a large number of civilian casualties and we don't know about British use of drones because there is no information about what's happening in Afghanistan.' Veteran peace campaigner Helen John, who has been living in a caravan adjacent to Waddington, also addressed the protestors. The retired nurse and midwife, 74, said she was disgusted the UK was using Reaper drones controlled from British soil. She said: 'If you are going about your normal business without interfering with anyone else you should not be able to be targeted by a drone. 'It's quite horrifying how people are happy to accept this happening. 'The opposition (to armed drones) is growing but it really has to speed up so that this type of weaponry is outlawed.' Many of the marchers carried banners bearing slogans including 'No More Drones' and 'Murdered by Robots', while others held up placards with photographs and names of individual drone strike victims. Local resident Pat Pilling, aged 71, was among those who backed the protest, which was organised by CND, the Drone Campaign Network, the Stop the War Coalition, and War on Want. 'My worry is that because they are controlling the drones from here, Waddington is now a target,' she said. Lethal: Campaigners are concerned the drones are being used to prolong the War on Terror with little public scrutiny . Drones: RAF-controlled Reaper drones are used to gather intelligence on the ground in Afghanistan, but also carry 500lb bombs and Hellfire missiles for precision strikes (file photo) Anger: The CND called the drones a 'barbaric form of hi-tech killing' 'We are just making ourselves a bigger target - they are controlled by kids in an air-conditioned room thousands of miles away with no concept of the devastation that they are causing.' In a speech to the protesters, Stop the War Coalition convener Lindsey German said: 'There is nothing like getting close up to these bases to see how menacing they are. 'It brings home that (the UK is) engaged in drone warfare - it is warfare which is operated remotely at absolutely no risk to anybody in this country but with terrible consequences for people in countries many, many thousands of miles away. 'Nobody knows how many have died and nobody knows their names.' Chris Nineham, vice-chair of the Stop the War Coalition, voiced concern that drones were being used to continue the so-called 'war on terror' with little or no public scrutiny. 'They're using them to fight wars behind our backs,' Mr Nineham said. 'Important weapon': The Ministry of Defence says the aircraft are operated by highly-trained military pilots who engage in the same rules of conflict as traditional RAF aircraft . Ground the Drones: Protesters held up banners and waved 'peace' signs during their afternoon of action . CND's general secretary, Kate Hudson, was also fiercely critical of armed drones, saying in a statement: 'It's time to end this remote killing before even more innocent civilians are slaughtered. 'They are the main victims in this barbaric form of high-tech killing.' The MoD says drones have played a vital role supporting military operations in Afghanistan and have 'undoubtedly' helped to save the lives of military personnel and those of countless Afghan civilians. Defence officials have also stressed that Reaper drones are primarily operated in Afghanistan in a surveillance and reconnaissance role. Rally: Opponents say use of the remote controlled drones in war-torn countries like Afghanistan is a blot on the UK's copybook and called for missions to stop . An MoD spokesman said: 'We fully respect people's right to protest peacefully and within the law. 'UK Reaper aircraft are piloted by highly trained professional military pilots who adhere strictly to the same laws of armed conflict and are bound by the same clearly defined rules of engagement which apply to traditionally manned RAF aircraft. 'In all military operations everything possible is done to avoid civilian casualties and this is no less the case with RPAS (Remotely Piloted Air System) operations.'","Four-hundred gather for march to RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire .

Could it be because he billed workdays that included 29 hours, 23 hours, 21.5 hours, and 21 hours? Ben Swift who went before the Ohio disciplinary committee on Monday Sept.16, averaged out to nine hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Court appointed attorneys like Swift are paid by the state and the county. According to Swift's attorney Gary Lepia, Swift did all of the work he claimed to do but kept a sloppy record of his hours. Ben Swift went before the Ohio Supreme Court on Monday Sept.16 for billing 29 hour work days . 'We routinely put in 10-11-hour (work) days,' said Swift. In an article published by the Dayton Daily News on March 6 2010, Montgomery County Juvenile Court judge Nick Kuntz said,'He’s probably billing more than humanly possible. That’s what it sounds like.' Kuntz's court was responsible for 60 per cent of Swift’s indigent case load. When public defenders can't take on a case, courts hire a private attorney. Swift handled 848 indigent cases and was one of 5 out of 170 attorneys on the Juvenile appointment list who were given cases at all. According to Ohio Public Defender Tim Young, giving a load of cases to a single attorney is problematic especially when they receive a large percentage of income from a single court. Kettering attorney William T. Daly said he believes that poor people who can't afford to hire a lawyer are being short-changed by favoritism in the legal appointment system. Montgomery County Juvenile Cort where Ben Swift was appointed for many cases . Daly said, 'Those attorneys that are more zealous, or perceived to be tenacious, are avoided because appointment of those attorneys creates more work for the magistrates, case coordinators and staff.' Between March 2008 and February 2009 the state and counties paid out $1.8 million to appointed counsel like Swift across Ohio for 43,495 hours of time. Swift said, 'Like any other thing in life, if somebody is doing a good job, you’re liable to go back to them.' The Ohio Supreme Court will decide what sanctions to impose upon Swift.","Ohio attorney Ben Swift's hours averaged out to nine hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year .

Poring over their fine-quality crochet, the prisoners of Brazil's Arisvaldo de Campos Pires maximum security penitentiary are a model of concentration. And it's no wonder, when you consider what's at stake. Thanks to a collaboration with Brazilian fashion designer Raquel Guimaraes, the inmates have one day taken off their sentence for every three days of knitting they perform. A stitch in time: Prisoners knit clothing for Brazilian fashion designer Raquel Guimaraes in the Arisvaldo de Campos Pires maximum security jail . Concentration: An inmate works on a woollen design as designer Raquel Guimaraes (left) walks past . The designer turned to the prison for help in 2009 when she had trouble finding knitters for her Doiselles label, which specialises in beautiful knitting and crochet work. She trained 18 prisoners sentenced for crimes ranging from robbery to murder, and their work is now exported globally, including to America, France, and Japan. The hand-made pieces, which are strictly quality-checked, are also sold in 70 stores in Brazil. Bleak: At first glance, Arisvaldo de Campos Pires looks like an unlikely setting for a high-fashion project . Maximum security: Guards escort designer Raquel into the Arisvaldo de Campos Pires penitentiary . Hard at work: The knitting team get down to business while the designer keeps an advisory eye on proceedings . Design for lifers: The woollens expert passes on her trade secrets as part of the Flor de Lotus project . Named the Flor de Lotus ('Lotus Flower') Project, the initiative is a chance for prisoners to earn money while serving their time. Participating inmates are paid a starting salary of 75 per cent of Brazil's minimum wage. A quarter of what they earn is put aside, and paid on their release. Former prison inmate Celio Tavares, who was jailed for armed robbery, said the project boosts prisoners' chances of finding a job when their sentences are up. High-end: The inmates' hand-made work is sold in around 70 stores in Brazil, as well as being exported to America and Japan . More than just a hobby: Former prison inmate Celio Tavares said the project gives prisoners confidence, and skills they can use in the outside world . Guidance: Raquel has trained around 100 prisoners to knit and crochet since the initiative started in 2009 . New tricks: The prisoners involved have been jailed for crimes ranging from armed robbery to murder . 'The program gives inmates skills and confidence they can use when they return to life on the outside. 'This raises the self-esteem of the prisoners, and opens the door to work and employment for everyone else,' he said. The prison is located in Juiz de Fora, in the state of Minas Gerais, about 100 miles (160 km) north of Rio de Janeiro. Time well spent: The work gives the inmates something to focus their energies on - as well as netting them a day off their sentence for every three they spend knitting . Unearthing new talents: A prisoner draws a fashion model from a photograph . Teamwork: Raquel says the inmates have proven their worth as knitters and are 'able to do any work' Ms Guimaraes, who works nearby, says around 100 inmates have taken up the knitting challenge since she started training them four years ago. She sees the project as a way for prisoners to be viewed as something more than criminals, explaining: . 'The remission of the sentence gives them the value of redeeming freedom, integrity and confidence. 'They are able to do any work and produce very well.' Hope for the future: As well as learning a marketable skill, the inmates earn wages which will ease their release into society .","Inmates at Arisvaldo de Campos Pires penitentiary have been taught to knit and crochet .

An American couple held in Qatar on child abuse charges since January have been freed from jail as they prepare their defense against charges that could see them both executed in the Persian Gulf nation. As of Wednesday, Matthew and Grace Huang are free to move about Qatar but cannot return home unless they are found not-guilty in a ruling likely to come in December. The Los Angeles natives are accused of starving their adopted daughter Gloria to death so they could sell her organs. Gloria was adopted from Ghana at age 4. The couple's family and lawyers said the charges are the result of cultural misunderstandings about international adoptions and faulty forensic evidence. Charged: Matthew and Grace Huang of Los Angeles have been jailed in the Middle East on a charge of murder with intent and are being accused of starving their 8-year-old daughter to death . The family's lawyers say they have not been allowed to present the Huang's side of the case since the could were arrested in January. On Tuesday, after a hearing by a four-judge panel, the chief judge announced in Arabic 'You have been set free,' Al-Jazeera reports. If the couple are convicted of starving their daughter to death, they could potentially be sentenced to death - though Qatar has had a de-facto moratorium on executions for the past ten years. At a hearing Wednesday, family friends testified about having lunch with the Huangs and their three adopted children days before Gloria's death. They said the couple made sure that all of their children ate. Their lawyers will now submit summaries of the evidence of the couple's innocence to the judges. They will meet in secret to review the evidence and the testimony and are expected to render a verdict in December. The Huangs claim Gloria was from medical problems complicated by anorexia-like bouts. The case has brought legal support and other aid from Californian groups, where the couple lived until 2012, and has highlighted potential cultural misunderstandings in a Gulf nation unfamiliar with adoption. Doha: The Huangs moved to Qatar in 2012 so Matthew Huang could work as an engineer on two major infrastructure projects associated with improvements for the 2022 World Cup . The prosecution alleges the couple . denied food to their daughter Gloria, who was born in Ghana and adopted . at the age of four. They also claim she was locked in her room at night. The couple say the girl had various . medical problems and also erratic eating habits, including periods of . binging and self-starvation. They say she was not allowed from her . room at night because of bizarre behavior during eating sprees, . including rummaging through garbage for food. She would also try to leave the house . at night in search of food and pick through the medicine cabinet on . late-night binges, according to a report prepared in the U.S. by Janice . Ophoven, a pediatric forensic psychologist who reviewed the case for the . family. The behavior is not uncommon in adopted children who have suffered from severe malnutrition in their past, the report says. Gloria, . who was slight for her age, also had been treated for an intestinal . parasite, and recent blood tests had showed severely low levels of a . certain type of white blood cell that could have been a sign of an . underlying bone marrow condition, as well as a vitamin D deficiency. When Gloria died, she was in an anorexic episode and had not eaten in as many as four days, Ophoven wrote in her report. A Qatari doctor who conducted Gloria's . autopsy found that the child's hips, ribs and spine protruded and . concluded the cause of death was dehydration and wasting disease. Supporters . in the U.S. say those diagnoses aren't possible and don't take into . account the child's long history of eating disorders and malnourishment . that caused lifelong health concerns, as well as recent blood work. Officials in Qatar also have raised questions about the adoption procedures, including payments to an adoption agency. This is likely because adoption is . virtually unknown in traditional Gulf Arab societies, where extended . families would provide care. In addition, an investigative report . by Qatari police raised questions about why the Huangs would adopt . children who did not share their 'hereditary traits' and raised concerns . that the children were part of a human trafficking operation or were . 'bought' for organ harvesting, according to the family's website. Matthew Huang was working on water . engineering projects as part of infrastructure improvements for Qatar's . hosting of the 2022 World Cup. The couple has two other children adopted from Africa. 'We are innocent,' Mr Huang told reporters . after a hearing. 'We are suffering.

A convicted killer who escaped from an open prison was caught by police tonight after ten days on the run. Alan Giles, 56, was imprisoned for life for the murder and kidnap of 16-year-old Kevin Ricketts in 1995, but had been moved to open conditions in HMP Hewell in Worcestershire as he was believed to be 'low risk'. He walked out of the prison on Monday 28 October, prompting a huge police manhunt. Escape: Alan Giles (left) was in the open part . of the multiple-category HMP Hewell in Redditch, Worcestershire, serving . two life sentences for the murder and kidnap of 16-year-old student . Kevin Ricketts (right) in 1995 . Officers from West Mercia Police were eventually able to apprehend the killer this evening after a member of the public called the police after spotting him in Alcester, Warwickshire. Police officers poured into the area after the sighting, and Giles tried to run away, but was taken into custody. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Judge . said: 'We are very pleased to have tracked down Mr Giles as the search . for him has taken up an enormous amount of our time and resources over . the past ten days. 'As . we always suspected, a tip-off from a member of the public was key to us . bringing Mr Giles back into custody tonight and I'd like to take this . opportunity to thank every single person who has come forward with . information to help our investigation. 'We . have been really impressed by the amount of information that has come . in and how keen people have been to help us with our inquiries.' As part of the police manhunt, officers had been scouring the countryside, using police dogs and helicopters in a bid to track Giles down. Members of the public were encouraged to call police with any information, but avoid approaching the killer if they saw him. While Giles was on the run, it was revealed that he was regularly allowed into the local community to work at a Sue Ryder charity shop in Alcester, where he was eventually found. Prison: Giles walked out of HMP Hewell in Redditch, Worcestershire - which can hold 1,261 prisoners . However, his placement ended after Giles had a heated argument with another worker in the shop. A whistleblower at HMP Hewell also alleged that wardens had recommended removing Giles from open conditions just five days before he absconded. It was also claimed that he actually disappeared on Sunday night, rather than Monday morning as claimed by officers, and that nobody realised he had gone until the following day. Police also warned the family of Giles's victim, Mr Ricketts, to stay at home during the hunt in case he was out for revenge. Hannah Tyler, the 19-year-old neice of Kevin Ricketts, tweeted: ‘Had a few people asking about this so just to confirm yes the news about the escaped prisoner does involve my family. ‘He kidnapped and murdered my uncle and he’s out. He has been missing for over 24 hours now and people need to know. Please contact the police if you see him. My family’s safety is at risk.’ Giles was among the first men in Britain to be convicted of a murder despite there being no trace of his victim's body. Mr Ricketts had failed to come home after a day at college in Brimingham in January 1995. Giles, who had recently split up with Kevin's older sister Elizabeth, quickly emerged as a suspect. He was convicted of murder and kidnap at Brimingham Crown Court in 1997 after a witness, Carl Morris, revealed Giles had convinced him to help dispose of the boy's body. Giles later confessed to police from his prison cell and told officers where to find the body. Describing the incident, he told officers: 'I don't know whether I grabbed him with one hand or two hands. You just lose it.

An upstate New York surgeon who had been accused of faking thousands of surgeries over five years has pleaded guilty to one count of healthcare fraud. Dr. Spyros Panos, formerly an orthopedic surgeon at Saint Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., changed his plea to guilty last week in federal court in White Plains. He faces 10 years in federal prison and has been fined $250,000. He will also pay the government $5 million as restitution, ABC News reported. Dr. Spyros Panos performed 'phantom surgeries' on dozens of patients and is blamed for at least one known death . The surgeon has been released on bail and will be sentenced in March 2013.

Tragic: Constance Nenni, second from left, is alleged to have died as a result of negligence on the part of Panos . Scheduling . as many as 22 surgeries a day, an almost unheard of workload, Panos was . billing for work never completed and his out of control greed resulted . in the death of a 76-year-old woman, one of the lawsuits alleged. Debra . Nenni McNamee alleges that in 2009 Panos was to have performed surgery . on her 76-year-old mother Constance Nenni’s left knee to repair damage . caused by arthritis, according to ABC. Panos is said to have described the procedure as ‘a simple in and out.’ The . procedure involved a small camera being inserted into Nenni’s knee to . help clean out any dead or damaged tissue found, a fairly routine . procedure. McNamee claims that less than 24 hours after the surgery, . Nenni died of a pulmonary embolism said to have been caused by a blood . clot that broke free and blocked the lung’s main artery, according to . reports. Though not a . common occurrence from knee surgery, older adults are more prone to such . complications from any type of surgery. The Dutchess County (NY) medical examiner’s report, purportedly, is what did Panos in. De Panos worked from the Mid-Hudson Medical Group in upstate New York (pictured) Debra Nenni said after his court appearance: 'I don't feel sorry for him at all.

Critique: Shadow Aviation spokesman Gordon Marsden, pictured in 2011, warned that the new plans pose a security risk . New Government plans to cut ‘red tape’ for private-hire business jets and light aircraft could leave a gaping hole in Britain’s border security which ‘would-be terrorists and criminals’ could exploit, Labour said today. It came after the government and Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) announced plans in a consultation ‘to strip away unnecessary bureaucracy for the UK General Aviation sector’. This General Aviation sector includes flights other than commercial scheduled air services and is worth around £1.4bn to the UK economy and supports up to 50,000 jobs. Most of the world’s air traffic falls into this category, from gliders to corporate flights. It also includes proposals to deregulate use of single-seat microlight aeroplanes. Aviation Minister Robert Goodwill said: ‘General Aviation is an extremely important sector of UK civil aviation and it is right that we do everything possible to enable it to thrive. That includes making sure that, where appropriate, we ease the burden on what are often smaller operators and businesses who find navigating a complex regulatory framework particularly challenging.’ But Labour’s Shadow aviation spokesman Gordon Marsden, MP for Blackpool South said the Government documents and ministerial statements announcing the cutting of red-tape fail to address security or the risk of terrorist and criminal exploitation. He said: ‘The Government claims they want to cut red tape but if their complacency on security issues isn’t addressed they’re in danger of creating a one-stop green light open-skies policy that criminals and potential terrorists could exploit.’ He added: ‘It’s frankly astonishing – given the level of concern about potential soft entry for would-be terrorists or criminals in the UK – and with thousands of small planes and hundreds of landing sites across the country where they may land – that the Department for Transport didn’t see fit to include such considerations in laying out a programme that will put heavy emphasis on self-regulation.’ Mr Marsden said: ‘It is extremely concerning that nowhere is there any focus or reference to security considerations that should be the top priority in any deregulation process. Flying high: The new plans by the government and Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) will make it easier for private jets and light aircrafts to travel to and from Britain . ‘The CAA document included eight themes on which the Government sought views – security concerns or implications do not figure in any of them.’ The Department for Transport said Mr Marsden’s fears appeared to be based on ‘a misunderstanding of the nature of this consultation.’ Improving: Aviation Minister Robert Goodwill wants to lighten the load for private flyers . But the Labour MP said that only last month the Director General of the UK Border Force admitted to Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee that some arrivals on small planes are not checked by his officers: ‘He told the committee that he has no accurate figures available on the number of such flights, and that there is no system to synchronise with the national air traffic system to supervise these flights into the UK. ‘ . The Labour aviation spokesman added: ‘We need urgent answers as to whether the UK Border Force or other security organisations were consulted or responded. And if not, why not. ‘We will be raising these issues urgently with the Department for Transport and the CAA and demanding that these concerns are given a central role as this process is rolled forwards’. But a Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘This appears to be a misunderstanding of the nature of this consultation, which was about stripping the General Aviation sector of unnecessary red tape. ‘The next stage is for industry to come forward with their thoughts and ideas on what areas they would like the new dedicated panel within the CAA to look at.  We have no pre-conceived views on what the panel might recommend and do not want to place unnecessary constraints on it other than providing a final report by the end of April next year.’ Minister without Portfolio Grant Shapps said: ‘The measures we are announcing today will ensure that the regulatory framework is proportionate – deregulating completely wherever possible, and minimising regulation where it is still necessary. ‘This will ensure that we have effective safety regulation while supporting the sector to grow. This is in line with both the Government’s deregulation commitment and also its wider drive for growth in the economy.’","Plans to ease bureaucracy for private aviation could be security risk .

Relatives and friends of a young man who fired shots in New Jersey's largest mall, trapping terrified shoppers for hours before killing himself, struggled Tuesday to reconcile those actions with a person they described as pleasant and well-liked. As pictures of 20-year-old Richard Shoop at a friend's wedding emerged investigators said they don't believe the gunman intended to shoot anyone when he arrived at the Garden State Plaza in Paramus and began firing into the ceiling. 'He told me that he was going to get a new job at this TV place and he was going to make good money,' said his childhood friend Madison Barbarini who happily posed for pictures with Shoop on her happy day in May 2011.

'He told me that he was doing really well and it seemed like he was really happy. Things just don't add up. Why would he do this? It doesn't make sense.' 'He honestly wouldn't hurt a fly.' News of Shoop's suicide stunned friends and relatives. However, investigators now believe Shoop intended 'suicide by cop'. 'We think he went in with the intent that he was not going to come out alive,' Bergen County Prosecutor John Molinelli said.

Police cars are parked outside the house where Richard Shoop lived in Teaneck, N.J. Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2013 . The suspect's brother, Kevin Shoop, told reporters outside their home on a quiet suburban block in Teaneck that his brother was 'a great person' who was liked by friends and family and gave no advance warning about what he intended to do. 'He just sadly decided to make an act of — an act of, I guess, self-indulgence — by taking his own life publicly,' Kevin Shoop said. 'And it's a tragedy to us all. And we're going to now handle matters and deal with them.' Dod Geges, the owner of a pizzeria in Teaneck where Shoop worked for several years, said Shoop didn't show violent tendencies and 'was always sad' when he heard about shootings on TV. Shoop left an ambiguous note with his family that raised concern, however. Molinelli, the prosecutor, would not call it a suicide note, but he said it did 'express that an end is coming. It could have been prison. ... It could have been what he did last night. It gave his family reason to reach out to us.' Jersey .

Response: Heavily-armed police are pictured outside the Garden State Plaza mall where gunman Richard Shoop's body was discovered in a part of the building still under construction . Hunt: Law enforcement officials gather outside the New Jersey mall. The gunman entered the building at around 9.30pm on Monday and reportedly strolled casually through shops firing bullets into the air . Governor Chris Christie called the shooting a wake-up call for lawmakers to focus on mental health issues as part of a comprehensive effort to reduce gun violence. 'Obviously that young man went there to end his own life. We may not be that lucky next time,' Christie said. 'We need to get to the root causes of what drives a young man like that to drive to Garden State Plaza in that condition.' It is not known whether Shoop had any mental health problems. Authorities said he had a known drug problem. Chaos erupted shortly before the mall's 9:30 p.m. closing time Monday when authorities said a man dressed in black and wearing a motorcycle helmet fired six shots. Molinelli said the gun, which was modified to look like an AK-47 assault rifle, belonged to Richard Shoop's brother, who owned it legally and did not give the shooter permission to take it. Evacuation: Shoppers are led out of the Westfield mall by an official wearing tactical gear . One witness said the gunman had told shoppers they would not be harmed as he fired shots in the air around them . At the mall Monday night, witnesses said the sound of gunfire sent customers and employees rushing hysterically for the exits and hiding places at the mall, which remained closed Tuesday. Officials said the mall would reopen Wednesday morning. Hundreds of law enforcement officers converged on the 2.2 million-square-foot mall, which was put on lockdown. New Jersey State Police landed a helicopter in the parking lot and SWAT teams with dogs initially went through the mall and started evacuating people. Shoop's body was discovered around 3:20 a.m. Tuesday in a back corridor, deep within a lower level of the mall in an area not accessible to the public, Paramus Police Chief Kenneth Ehrenberg said.

A judge who refused to give a triple killer a whole life sentence because of a European human rights ruling was wrong, the  Government’s most senior law officer ruled yesterday. Mr Justice Sweeney had said last month that it was ‘not appropriate’ to sentence Ian McLoughlin to die behind bars because Strasbourg judges had ruled such terms were a breach of human rights. But yesterday the Attorney General, Dominic Grieve, declared the 40-year jail term to be too soft, and referred the case back to the Court of Appeal. He said a whole-life tariff ‘ought to have been made on the facts of the case’. A spokesman said: ‘After careful consideration, the Attorney General has decided to make a reference to the Court of Appeal in relation to the sentence of Ian McLoughlin for the murder of Graham Buck. ‘McLoughlin received a  sentence of life imprisonment with a 40-year minimum term. ‘The Attorney General considers that a whole-life order ought to have been made on the facts of the case and that the sentence was therefore unduly lenient.’ Three Court of Appeal judges will consider the case within weeks and could increase the sentence if they agree with Mr Grieve. McLoughlin, 55, butchered good samaritan Graham Buck, 66, while on day release in July from an earlier prison term for murder. Mr Buck was fatally stabbed in the neck when he interrupted McLoughlin robbing the home of an 87-year-old neighbour  Francis Cory-Wright. McLoughlin was on day release from HMP Spring Hill, Buckinghamshire, where he was serving a 25-year term for the murder of  Brighton barman Peter Halls whom he stabbed multiple times in 1992. He had already served time for the 1984 killing of Len Delgatty, 49, who he had hit over the head with a hammer, and so was expected to be put behind bars forever. But sentencing him at the Old Bailey on October 21, the judge said he could not pass a whole-life term. Call for review: Attorney General, Dominic Grieve has declared the 40-year jail term to be too soft and that the Court of Appeal consider the sentence based upon the facts of the case . Britain is the ‘best pupil in class’ for obeying edicts from Strasbourg, a senior eurocrat declared yesterday. At a Westminster hearing, Thorbjorn Jagland, secretary general of the Council of Europe, said the rest of the continent looked to the UK to set an example on human rights. He then claimed that if the UK did not obey the diktat on  prisoner votes, it would set a bad example to countries such as Russia. And he warned that Britain’s international influence would be diminished if it decided to go for the ‘nuclear possibility’ of not complying with the ruling. His comments angered MPs. Dominic Raab said: ‘This is yet more patronising drivel from the eurocrats. ‘The idea we should sacrifice democracy at home to promote the European agenda abroad is a Faustian bargain Parliament should reject.’ He told the court the whole-life order was a breach of Article three of the European Convention and it was ‘not appropriate’ to impose such a term. The judge was following a Strasbourg ruling made in July which said whole-life terms were unlawful. But its decision is not binding on domestic courts and ministers have not yet declared how they will respond. The judge’s decision was criticised on the day by Justice  Secretary Chris Grayling. He said: ‘We are considering the Government’s response to the ECHR’s recent ruling but this in no way alters that fact and courts should continue to impose whole life tariffs where they wish to do so.’ Yesterday the Buck family’s MP, Mike Penning, said: ‘McLoughlin has killed three times, on separate occasions. ‘It beggars belief we are unable to pass a whole-life sentence because of his human rights. ‘Mr Buck’s family, and the whole local community, deserve justice and I am pleased the Attorney General agrees that the sentence is unduly lenient and is going to refer this case to the Court of Appeal.’","Ian McLoughlin, 55, was not given a life sentence for third killing .

"By . Gerri Peev, Political Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 20:16 EST, 6 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:16 EST, 6 November 2013 . A report from the Public Accounts Committee, chaired by Margaret Hodge, pictured, claimed a 'personal assistant' signed off contracts worth more than £30 million as part of the Universal Credit programme . A ‘personal assistant’ signed off contracts worth more than £30 million as part of the government’s flagship Universal Credit programme, a report claims today. A damning study from MPs warned that the implementation of the all-in-one tax and benefits system was marred by ‘shocking failures’ that had wasted at least £140 million. It had been blighted by ‘alarmingly weak’ management with low-grade civil servants allowed to authorise payments worth millions of pounds. In some cases, it was unclear what suppliers had been paid for, the Public Accounts Committee said. The Department for Work and Pensions had ‘neglected to implement basic procedures for monitoring and authorising expenditure’, it alleged. ‘We saw evidence that purchase orders with a total value of £8.7 million were approved by a personal assistant to the programme director,’ the MPs said. ‘In another case, two purchase orders, one for £22.6 million and one for £1.1 million, were approved by a personal assistant to the programme director whose delegated financial authority at the time of approvals was only £10 million.’ Some individual payments to suppliers could also not be linked to pieces of work delivered. IT programmes worth £140 million had to be ‘written off’ because they were unusable. MPs also warned the £2.3 billion universal credit programme could not meet its deadline to be fully delivered by 2017. A pilot of the scheme was branded ‘inadequate’ as it was ‘open to fraud’. The trial was also limited to only the simplest new claims of those who were single and had no dependents. Universal Credit is due to replace six means-tested benefits in four years’ time. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith insisting it can ensure people are always better off in jobs and save £38 billion by 2023. But PAC chairman, Labour’s Margaret Hodge, said the implementation so far had been ‘extraordinarily poor’. The report claimed that IT programmes worth £140 million had to be 'written off' because they were unusable (file picture) ‘The failure to develop a comprehensive plan has led to extensive delay and the waste of a yet to be determined amount of public money,’ she said, adding: ‘£425 million has been spent so far on the programme. It is likely that much of this, including at least £140 million worth of IT assets, will now have to be written off. The management of the programme has been alarmingly weak. ‘From the outset, the department has failed to grasp the nature and enormity of the task; failed to monitor and challenge progress regularly; and, when problems arose, failed to intervene promptly. ‘Lack of day-to-day control meant early warning signs were missed, with senior managers becoming aware of problems only through ad hoc reviews.’ A spokeswoman for Iain Duncan Smith, pictured, said action had been taken to fix the problems with universal credit . She also attacked the department for its ‘fortress culture’ and deluding itself by reporting ‘only good news’ while ‘problems were denied’. MPs said the project would not hit its current target of enrolling 184,000 claimants by April 2014. Committee member and Tory MP Richard Bacon said: ‘In developing IT projects, government departments can no longer be allowed to mark their own homework.’ Labour’s Frank Field, a former social security minister, said: ‘Labour should show the courage to scrap this monster of a project and provide voters with a real and positive alternative - a something for something welfare state with National Insurance at its heart and a cap on means-tested benefits.’ A spokeswoman for Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘Both the NAO [National Audit Office] and the PAC acknowledged a fortress mentality within the [universal credit] programme. Iain was clear back in the summer about how he and the Permanent Secretary took action to fix those problems. He has every confidence with the team now in place, and that team includes Robert Devereux [the permanent secretary]. A DWP spokeswoman said that the department did not recognise the £140 million write off figure. She added: ‘No contracts were signed off by a personal assistant. They were agreed by the relevant programme authority and the PA simply completed the administration processes necessary. However, stronger financial controls have been put in place so that this doesn’t happen again.’ ‘Universal Credit is a vital reform that rewards work instead of trapping people on benefits. It will ultimately bring a £38bn economic benefit to society. ‘This report doesn’t take into account our new leadership team, or our progress on delivery. We have already taken comprehensive action including strengthening governance, supplier management and financial controls.’","Public Accounts Committee said scheme suffered from weak management .
